Kenzi Rose Garden,vivian a wrote a review Mar 22,50,Kindly read,Kenzi is one of the great hotels I stayed in over the period I was there in February 2023 for my birthday… I went solo for my birthday and had an amazing time. From the entrance I want to specifically appreciate and recommend the lady who offers the traditional tea and sweets which is really nice for me I didn’t just have it the first day I had it several times when I had to wait for my ride at the lobby.  I also want to appreciate Nassima for coming through when I informed them about my birthday 🥳 she decorated my room and had cake sweet and flowers for me … this was truly beautiful. I could go on and on…. But the only issue I had was the fact that even if I booked my room for one person I had no right to any visitors I had a friend who came in from London and was residing at a different hotel which was far from mine and other things to do in Marrakech and I really wanted her to take me to the sulk market and also have dinner at a close by restaurant. With all this it was only fair that I ask her to come with her stuff and dress at my hotel so she doesn’t have to waste time and transport since she was traveling back to London the next day. But unfortunately the receptionist and Sercurity didn’t permit it even after I told them she wasn’t going to sleep over which was true. They really made it embarrassing which wasn’t necessary. I really hoped they had at least considered and handled it better by suggesting a better option. For instance if they say okay we trust you and we could permit her for an hour to change her outfits since she’s not sleeping over. Which is better even if it means they timed us and make sure she leaves the room once the time elapsed… that would have been better. In all Kenzi is a nice hotel.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled solo,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E5871VQviviana

Kenzi Rose Garden,425PaulB wrote a review Mar 15,30,Very mediocre at best,After reading previous reviews on Trip Advisor we were disappointed by a number of aspects of our stay. The booking in process took almost half an hour and there appeared to have been a mix up with the rooms. The room we were allocated was not the level we had booked but as we had arrived late we accepted it for the first night. However apart from not having a balcony the window was jammed and didn’t open the safe didn’t work one of the bedside lights didn’t work at all and the other one flickered! Not a great start.  We were moved to another room in the morning which was OK.  Really unimpressed with breakfast - the only fruit was sliced orange and grapefruit + apples! Surely somewhere like Morocco must have better access to fresh fruit?! The cereal selection was also poor. There was a plentiful supply of all sorts of pastry for those who wanted it.  On the penultimate day we returned to our room to find it hadn’t been made up and requested they did so while we were out at dinner but could they drop off towels immediately so that we could have a shower before we went out. They didn’t arrive! When we returned they had made up the beds but left a dirty cloth in the shower and hadn’t replaced the water or shower/shampoo. All pretty sloppy.  Finally - not impressed with the concierge. We asked one of them to book a restaurant and before he had done so one of his colleagues came over and started talking to him. Rather than ask him to wait he continued his conversation and finally got round to our booking.  Overall our experience at this hotel was just not satisfactory. It wasn’t just us that felt that way. We were with a group of 44 golfers staying in the hotel and all felt the same way - particularly about the lack of fruit at breakfast.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Chearsley,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/425PaulB
Kenzi Rose Garden,kalibwana wrote a review Mar 14,20,Arrogant reception staff,This is a nice spacious hotel with lovely pools. Unfortunately it seems to suffer with strangely arrogant reception staff who don't seem willing to help their guests. I tried to check in but was told by a young male receptionist who wasn't willing to make eye contact that because they couldn't find the booking I had made despite me showing the email confirmation. The receptionist then said he would need to check with the reservations department before he could check me in and disappeared so to do. He ushered me to a seat in direct view of the reception desk and said he'd come back. Needless to say he never did return and so half an hour or so later I then had to approach another receptionist who had no problems checking me in at all. Later I had reason to request a change of room (I had booked a garden view and requested a quiet room) which turned out to mean a noisy room on the side of the road (be warned!) and was told in no uncertain terms by a female receptionist that they were fully booked. There was no attempt at empathy let alone to find a solution to the problem. On checkout I struggled to get a female receptionists attention but after she had finally started to check me out someone else came to the desk to check out and she started to help him instead.  Needless to say I won't be back.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kalibwana
Kenzi Rose Garden,babylonian_brit wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Five stars hotel and service,We had a stay here after some other accommodation fell through having used the hotel prior to refurbishment many years ago when it was known as Kenzi Farah. We are very happy we chose this hotel. We stayed in room 4004 which was spacious and well positioned. The toiletries were regularly replenished by our excellent maid Hind and her supervisor with the quality of soaps and creams very high. The breakfast was excellent with the fresh orange juice and fried donuts being a highlight. Lastly we need to specially mention Chayma Hajita from reception who was extremely courteous and thoughtful. She helped us to organise late checkout and was always friendly with any queries we had. We would definitely like to stay here again in the future,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/babylonian_brit

Best location just 10 minutes away from JAMAA EL FNA Sq. (50 MAD) by taxi and you find yourself at a paradise. Huge spaces wonderful gardens and swimming pools (the large one heated).

Kenzi Rose Garden,khadigia s wrote a review Jan 2023,50,Wonderful experience,We booked this hotel last minute and stayed there for 5 nights and we will definitely come back the staff was amazing they were kind helpfulfriendly especially the Concierge the bar waiter Rachid and all his colleagues(i didn’t catch all the names unfortunately) all the staff in both restaurant L’orangerie for breakfast and lunch same as La terrazza delle rose they made us feel so welcomed and ready to help or sort out everything. A special thanks goes to the housekeeping always friendly especially the lady that has been cleaning our room every day she really nice! Without forgetting the animation staff(Namira pedro tima bright james rachid Omar) that are always available to make you happy and entertained.  A customer service like this is rare to find and they are definitely the best part of our stay!    The only department that need improvement is the reception they need more communicationI payed £150 for an extrabed that I never received during my stay and the day before our check out we spoke with Hanane for a late check out and she confirmed for us that the maximum that we can stay was until 15 complimentary  the following day someone from the front desk called us at 13 saying that we need to leave and to pay that was so annoying because it seemed that we were lying.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/984khadigias
Kenzi Rose Garden,Lucy b wrote a review Jan 2023,10,"WORST HOTEL IVE EVER VISITED rude, smug manager who laugh in your face, things stolen from our room.",Wow- I cannot disuade anyone highly enough from visiting this dirty overrated hotel.    Rooms stink of cigarettes hallways are filthy no balcony and men who stare you down.    I will be making a formal complaint about this place. Asked for help but was met with eye rolls sniggers and unintelligent staff who talk/ laugh about you when you e walked away from the reception desk.    Worst hotel I’ve ever been to not a 5 star hotel but a 3 at best. The manager is extremely rude and aggressive when we needed help with something.,Date of stay: March 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Londonreviews321

It really is a beautiful hotel with very nice rooms but with a terrible service inattentive rude and rushed staff. Far from being a five star hotel. Oh! I almost forgot... an horrible food.

Thank you to the animation team: Bright james pedro omar namira rachid mimi tima siham we would like to thank you for making our stay amazing. We enjoyed the activities and the good vibes. You guys did a great job we really enjoyed our vacation at the hotel in Marrakech.    The lady at the reception did her very best for us she was very nice. We were allowed to use the pool after checkout time. How nice she let us take a shower after checkout time. This people know what service is.    This hotel is very clean and the rooms are very nice. The breakfast is also very nice and there is a big choice in the food. The hotel is located near the center of jamaa elfna near Menara Mall and Gueliz. So you can reach all those places walking.

Kenzi Rose Garden,graham t wrote a review Aug 2022,50,The Entertainment Team are truly AMAZING (and so are the other staff too)!,I’m going to write two reviews for the hotel and it’s staff here in Marrakesh. This one is for the staff who work tremendously hard to keep everyone entertained and happy during their stay at Kenzi Rose.    Firstly upon arrival we didn’t get the greatest service from the reception as our rooms weren’t ready. The team on reception weren’t very helpful in this matter which was reiterated by the concierge when delivering our luggage as he apologised on their behalf.    With that all said this was the only downside to our experience of the staff at the hotel. Everyone else has been fantastic. The best and most welcoming and entertaining of all are the entertainment crew and I’d like to name check them all as they are all totally worth a mention: James ‘Lazy Boy’ Omar Nomiro Bright Tina Mimi Rachid Pedro Siham and not forgetting Bob! Forgive me if I have spelt any of your names wrong!😀 Every day each of them went out of their way to stop and say ‘hello’ always with a smile on their faces. Even when my daughter was a little upset in one of the days.    The other people I would like to praise are: Outside Bar - Abdul Nassir  Concierge - Shariff  Front gate security- Mustapha  Trip Guide - Sahid  Also the gentleman who sorts the trips out (who’s name I don’t know) as he has been brilliant too!    Everyone I have mentioned have more than gone out of their way to make all the family feel so so welcome. You are all a credit to the hotel.    Thank you to you all and to anyone of you I have not mentioned as you have made our stay the best it could be.    Thank you again  Graham Sharon Amelia and Stella (the ‘lazy’ Taylors)😀🕺🏻⛱,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Derby, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gray1971

Don’t have anything to say if you wake up early because the minute your awake someone else takes them. Been asking for towels and toilet paper so many times multiple days and it takes them a whole day to fix it. Taxi drivers outside of the hotel that are nagging. Show for children outside lasting for hours at night.  The restaurant at the hotel made us pay for something we did not order when she did not understand English.

Kenzi Rose Garden,ZKUK80 wrote a review Aug 2022,30,Honest Review,Stayed here from 12/8/22 to 19/8/22    Firstly this is advertised as a 5 star hotel but it's more like upper 3 star.    Pros  -Very good location which is close to the Menara mall and about 15 mins walk to the main square you will not be stuck for eating places or access to the local sights and the surrounding area is nice and safe.  -The hotel was clean and had decent facilities like 3 pools a few shops and restaurants and a gym with a spa.  -Me and the wife had a very nice couples hammam and massage so credit to the staff.  -Rooms were nice and modern and the bed was big and comfortable and the AC in the room was perfect.    Cons  -WiFi is very sketchy it keeps disconnecting in the room however works perfectly fine if you walk a couple of steps into the ensuite bathroom. Weirdly it works everywhere else in the hotel fine apart from in your actual bedroom.  -The major bugbear of this hotel is the pools. There aren't enough beds to go around and what people will do is come early in the morning to claim one and stick a towel down then go do whatever like have breakfast or go out for hours so their bed is saved for the day.  I have never experienced this in any other hotel if people leave then their place should be gone yet staff do nothing about this even when I asked them to. Don't think you can come in the afternoon and get a bed you won't until about 7pm or enjoy sunbathing on the floor as that's your other option.  -There's an indoor pool which is mainly empty as you have to pay 100dhs a day to use it for some reason however it should be free.  -buffet breakfast is decent with a ok selection however they could have more variety and not the same items every day.  -You can have lunch at the restaurant which is a small BBQ and buffet however it's 150dhs per person and you still have to pay for drinks again no value in it.  -You'll get 2 water bottles a day in your room and if you want more it will cost 20dhs (you'll get a big bottle from the local shop for 6dhs)  if the cleaner happens to forget to replenish this as ours did a few times then good luck in trying to ask for some more got told none left on one occasion and if you happen to pass them in the hall then it will take at least 2/3 hours before they bring you the water that they forgot to replenish in the first place.  When it's roughly 40c outside the hotel should be providing it free upon request as per all the other 5 stars in multiple countries/hotels I've stayed at.  -You have to pay a tax of 30dhs a day per person as well for some reason so another money making scheme for the hotel.  -TV reception is poor there's 1 English movie channel and a couple of news channels but the rest are Arabic and French.  -Some staff are great like the guy at the pool bar who put the footie on for me in the bar TV and was very friendly and the porters and tea lady others not so like the guy who told me off while I picked up a takeaway from outside and told me not to eat in the lobby only my room and repeated himself a few times maybe wait to see where I was eating it first before telling me off.    I'm sure the hotel will reply with the same response to this review as all the others about valuable feedback and making improvements but seems like it's just a standard response as people have been giving similar feedback for ages.    This isn't a bad hotel and overall it was an enjoyable stay but please don't consider yourself as 5 star as some of the practices and service definitely needs improvement from all not just some staff and falls well below what you would expect in a 5 star hotel.    Please don't take the above as me giving a poor review for the sake of it more advising people on what to expect and if people are fine with the above I'm sure you will have a nice stay.    I would seriously have to think twice before considering if I wanted to stay here again it's not an automatic yes unfortunately.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bradford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/499zubeirk

Kenzi Rose Garden,Jonathan M wrote a review Aug 2022,20,"Gag Clauses, Endless Waiting and NO ALL INCLUSIVE",I would like to start my review by ensuring I clarify that the Kenzi Rose Farah/Garden hotel is in no way responsible for not receiving our booking prior to our arrival; largely I must say this due to being forced to sign an agreement to this effect before being allowed to stay in the hotel following a day and a half of issues.    When arriving at the hotel we went to reception and were kept waiting for over an hour due to our travel agent not passing on the booking information to the hotel. Whilst we asked for water whilst waiting this was not provided and instead reception seemed more interested with dealing with other customers rather than our issue.    Over an hour later I was informed we would have to pay a deposit to stay in the hotel for the night and I had to negotiate for drinks and evening food to also be provided since we had booked an all inclusive package.    The next day I returned to reception at 8am to try to sort out the booking issue and was told to return at 10am. Returning at 10am I was informed that the booking had finally been received (due to myself having someone from home chase the agents that morning). However I was also told there would be no all inclusive offering since the hotel no longer offers this despite it still being advertised on TUI at the time we were at the hotel.    After the reception staff giving little in the way of apology or ways to navigate this situation we found a review on tripadvisor with the same issue. This review outlined how the guests had asked to speak to the guest relations manager who agreed to honour their booking. We also asked for the guest relations manager who came to reception to discuss the issue with us at roughly 11am. Nassima was very apologetic for the problems and within 5 minutes had agreed to also honour our booking and took us to the bar to show which drinks we may have throughout our stay.    Once returning to reception we went to our room to finally begin our holiday at roughly 11:30am. 20 minutes later we received a phone call to come back to the reception where Nassima revoked our drinks being included in the stay and informed us that it would no longer be available. In hindsight I imagine this was due to her manager not being happy with the decision although we were told at the time that this was because the agent hadn’t paid for them.    For the sake of this review and since it isn’t a problem in relation to the Kenzi Rose I will miss out the detail on us being taken to a new hotel by the agent which was of a substandard quality. Following this we arrived back at the Kenzi Rose Farah at roughly 3-4pm.    Returning to the hotel we went to check back in now having wasted nearly a full day and an evening of our holiday. However prior to being allowed to go to our room we were required to sign the aforementioned document stating that we would not leave a review blaming the hotel for the booking issue.    Throughout our stay minor further problems also took place. One evening at dinner a waiter had provided water after I clarified if it was free we were then charged for this when leaving the dining hall rather than the waiter going to ask someone to assist him since he didn’t understand our question. Further to this the free drinks provided on the first night were charged to us at the end of our stay and when I asked to speak to Nassima this was not reverted even though the receptionist at the time had said they were complimentary.    Overall I would not stay at the Kenzi Rose Farah again. The hotel seemed far more concerned with numbers through the door than understanding the concerns of the guests.,Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonathanmL303FJ
Kenzi Rose Garden,Steven wrote a review Aug 2022,20,Never again,It was one of those hotel experiences you hope you don’t encounter. It’s not terrible  but it is poor. Guests are treated like numbers. It says it is a 5 star hotel but in reality feels like a 3 star.    When I first arrived I was made to wait one hour. I arrived at 3.15pm after the stated check in time of 3pm. But I didn’t receive my room until 4.30pm.    The room itself was clean. But the furnishing and room was old. The internet was unstable and kept disconnecting.    At breakfast it was a mad rush to find a table among the hundreds of people and getting food and drinks was a challenge. There were no more coffee and juice cups for the last hour of breakfast.    At least staff are courteous.

Kenzi Rose Garden,Louise A wrote a review Jun 2022,40,"Relaxing, good location, amazing food",We were 2 female friends and stayed at kenzi rose for 7 nights all inclusive which was booked with TUI. TUI had not informed us that the hotel had stopped doing all inclusive and the hotel explained we were full board but all inclusive still… anyway there was no snacks or drinks menu for all inclusive option which was a shame although not the hotel fault. The hotel itself is gorgeous and excellent location 15 mins walk to the medina souks etc and bars are close by. The food was the best buffet I’ve ever had it was very tasty and better standard than the usual all inclusive food (which i usually give up on half way through the week). The staff were amazing so kind and helpful we made friends with a number of them and even went out with some to a local bar. The room was cleaned daily which was great. The pool was very clean and the sunloungers lovely and comfortable with plenty of choice. One pool was quieter than the other so you have that option.Overall 4.5 stars and I would highly recommend you stay here if you want somewhere peaceful away from the busy centre but still walking distance to all the attractions.    Some tips - taxi drivers try to overcharge so ask he hotel how much your journey should cost and they will help. Also if people offer you things you don’t want in the markets or outside just say no straight away and be firm.,Date of stay: June 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Swansea, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/broganarcher

Kenzi Rose Garden,Tej wrote a review May 2022,40,Almost a really good hotel,First time visit to the Kenzi Rose and it started off a bit bad. I had booked an inclusive package with TUI however the hotel stated they stopped doing this last year. TUI are selling packages that are not being offered by the hotel anymore so there’s some sort of miscommunication here. This is not necessarily Kenzi’s fault.  Kenzi did offer us full board but this is not what we booked!  Anyway along came Hiba from guest relations and she took ownership of the situation. I felt that she listened to us and did her best to put us at ease. She did eventually sort us out with the all inclusive package in the end. Well done Hiba you are a credit to the Kenzi Rose and it was a pleasure to meet you.  Also like to mention all of the animation team who kept us entertained on a daily basis - we did enjoy the banter with you!  The hotel itself is in a superb location and the rooms were pretty decent.

Room: decent. Housekeeping failed to replace towels and/or bottled water and/or toiletries every day so had to call reception each day.  Restaurants: buffet breakfast was fine if very repetitive. Cooks on the waffle and omelette station weren’t wearing gloves - yuck. Didnt eat dinner at hotel so no comments.  Pool: decent. Only one guy behind the pool bar (which didn’t serve booze so had to go another bar area for drinks) serving the entire pool area. How about employing some more staff? It’s not like there aren’t loads of unemployed people on the streets.  Loads of pigeons and so loads of pigeon sh!t everywhere.  Bar: manned by three stoney faced bartenders. How about cracking a smile guys? Zero vibes.  Tennis court: one clay court good condition. There was a guy with a hotel guest doing target practice with a bb rifle when I walked on with my son to play tennis. They asked if we were going to play tennis — yes it’s a tennis court guys!! They carried on for about 5-10 mins then left. Very odd.  Gym: small no air con.    Won’t be back!

Kenzi Rose Garden,Natasha B wrote a review Apr 2022,10,Please don't bother!,We booked this 5-star hotel based on the information we read online about its facilities and amenities. The reviews were good on Trip Advisor and we were really looking forward to our first stay in Morocco.  How disappointed we were!  From the moment we stepped foot in the hotel we were greeted by reception staff who were not overly friendly or helpful. We tried to upgrade our room to one with a balcony and were told that none were available.  The room we were allocated was right on the main road and very noisy and the air conditioning and fridge didn't work.  My husband tried to order a beer at the bar after seeing another guest with a bottle at his table only to be told they didn't serve alcohol and if we wanted it we needed to speak with the hotel manager. After a lengthy conversation and no real explanation as to why we were being refused alcohol several reasons were thrown around and we were eventually served a half bottle of beer (charged full price) and an alcoholic mojito with more lemon and mint than anything else. The original waiter we had spoken to refused to serve us and walked out of the bar area.  We were told that the dinner service was between 7.30pm and 10.30pm but when we went down the restaurants were closed. My husband asked a chef about the service and was greeted by shrugging shoulders.  We tried again the following day to order a beer and were told that on that particular day they weren't serving alcohol because of Ramadan and that we wouldn't find anywhere else in Morocco that did serve alcohol. We found out through another family that the hotel had in fact lost its licence but we had been fed so many lies by this point and were made to feel so guilty and uncomfortable that we decided to leave straight away and find accommodation at another hotel.  The hotel made no effort to make us stay and were in no way apologetic for the horrible service we had experienced. No refund was offered and we were charged for the full 5 nights when we only stayed for 2.  The lack of transparency really upset us and we did find alternative accommodation that was absolutely amazing and was the polar opposite to this establishment. We will not be returning to this hotel.,Date of stay: April 2022,,"Bracknell, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natashabF6099AE

The restaurant is under the supervision of Rabbi Revach from Israel whom we spoke to before we came. The kashrus standard is mehadrin and has full time hashgocho.    The food was high end and the restaurant has a great ambiance and atmosphere. I must say the cost was very reasonable.

Kenzi Rose Garden,Eric S wrote a review Aug 2021,30,Good Hotel. Room For Improvement.,We were looking for a mix of pool holiday with some excursions and day trips throughout the 11 day stay. We went all inclusive with Tui. Mrs S speaks Arabic fluently and this will become relevant when I cover the Negatives. I’m just focusing on the hotel in this review and nothing else. We are a family of three with 10 year old Ms S also in tow.    Positives:    The hotel the grounds the pool and the room were immaculate and well maintained. Its been recently refurbishished and it shows. Very modern.    The food throughout the day was prepared to a high standard and there was plenty of choice.    The entertainment staff ran plenty of activities throughout the day for adults and children. You could dip in and out and there was no pressure to get involved. They run a mini disco for kids after dinner and then put some entertainment on afterwards for the adults. Its very low key and not cheesy.    It’s a short transfer from the airport but no aircraft noise. Its close enough to the centre of the city that you can walk or get a taxi but far enough away that it’s a bit quieter.    It’s got lots of space and quiet areas where you can sit down and get of out of the sun for a bit.    The pool amenities (loungers parasols tables etc) are clean and well maintained.    There is a taxi rank across the road from the main entrance.    Negatives:    It took less time to clear the airport (passport control baggage collection customs) than it did to check in to the hotel. When we started there seemed a genuine unawareness we were expected or that we were on the hotel booking system. We effectively started from scratch and thankfully had all the Tui documents printed out to help smooth the way. We had to fill in a set of forms with information that I would have expected the hotel to have been told by Tui in advance.    During the check in process we were told we needed to pay a mandatory refundable charge before the room could be released to us. This was separate to local taxes which we had already paid. This amounted to £600 GBP so not a small amount by any standard. We paid this and waited around for another party who we were travelling with to complete their check in. That’s when we noticed they hadn’t been asked to pay this extra money despite boarding on the same basis as us. We challenged this and it was explained as a charge because we hadn’t paid the full amount. Obviously we had paid the full amount otherwise we wouldn’t have been able to get on the plane at Gatwick. This then became a charge to cover extra expenses should we wish to use room service. This then became an optional charge which the hotel would refund the following day. We asked for the refund then and there and then had to wait another week before it showed up. Make of it what you will.    They gave us twin beds when we asked for a double and a single and in fairness to them the reception staff swapped us to another room. The single bed was for our daughter and on three separate occasions we asked for a duvet and got a single towel instead. Eventually another party that we knew at the hotel gave us their spare duvet for the duration.    The air con in the rooms is centrally controlled so you cannot change it to suit your preferences. Its either on or off.    Mrs S took our daughter into one of the pools with a t-shirt on to protect her shoulders from sunburn. We had done this for several days without issue. Other children in the pool had t-shirts on and some of the women were wearing burkinis were loose fitting. The man in charge of the pools took it upon himself to talk out loudly and without much discretion or subtlety from the poolside to my wife. When told why our daughter was wearing a t-shirt he said that wasn’t his problem and then said he would go and call security if she didn’t get out. My wife called his bluff and then we had a stand-off. I noticed what was going on so I had it out with him and we went round in circles. I then went with him to the duty manager to discuss the policy around t-shirts and how to deal with hotel guests. We were given an “exception” so that our daughter could wear her t-shirt.    We used the hotel’s currency exchange to swap pound some money round. This is done at the reception. We had a very strange counting out of our pounds which was then put away in a drawer before the dirhams came out and then an equally strange counting out of dirhams which went in phases. Mrs S counted out the money and when it came up short only at that point did the reception staff source the outstanding currency we were due.    The breakfast had a huge variety of cooked and cold breakfast options and you could have teas coffees fresh juices etc. They supplied butter for the bread rolls baguettes and toast. However once you went to lunch or dinner the coffee machines were switched off and all you could have was either bottled water or a fizzy soft drink. The bread options remained but they seem to hide the butter. You obviously check in at the entrance to the restaurant but despite that if you want a drink you then have to supply them your room number and they give you a receipt. There is a bar area with a wider selection of drinks at the other side of the grounds but that defeats the point of being all inclusive at the restaurant. Also the bar staff and restaurant staff on occasion will serve you a non chilled cold drink which in temperatures of 40 degrees plus is not a very pleasant option.    Generally the size of any drink option is on the small side and you have to have multiple glasses to make up the difference.    We got to day 7 with no sign of changed bedsheets so we had to force the issue by putting all the bedsheets on the floor.    We went out early one day (7am) for a trip to Casablanca and although not physically stopped from leaving the hotel the security staff were certainly on edge that we were leaving and definitely wanted to know where we were going and what room number we were in. It was a bit weird. Its two adults and a child clearly on a day trip so I’m not too sure what the issue was. There is no need to check in with reception if leaving the hotel.    Similarly we checked out on our last day but kept our luggage with us until we wanted to leave. We had similar pantomimes trying to leave.    There is no hotel directory in the rooms so if you want to call reception or order room service or know where the nearest chemist is etc then good luck.    Our first week was generally quiet it got busier in the second week and the pools at times were at capacity and almost unusable; this was reflected in the sun lounger availabity and the usual nonsense with towels being laid out on the loungers early on. One of the pools is only 40cm deep and for very young childern; the other pool is used at times by the entertainment staff so it halves in capacity leaving only one pool left to use.    Would we visit Marrakech again? Definitely. Would we stay at the Kenzi Rose Garden again? We’d probably try somewhere else. It wouldn’t be a problem if we had to stay here but we’d be wise to some of the shortcomings.    When you visit other countries you flex to their customs and ways. Generally you don’t do this in a hotel and I would expect them to flex to the customer who is paying for the privilege. Some of the staff could do with visiting La Manounia to get their heads round customer service and expectations. I won’t be checking back on the review for the hotel’s response.,Date of stay: August 2021,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ericsX3617VX
Kenzi Rose Garden,Poletino wrote a review Aug 2021,40,Very clean hotel with no holiday vibes,Good location and very clean hotel. The food is excellent and enough for all. The pool area is very nice and clean. The problem is that the bar closes at 9PM so if you want a drink you have to call room service and pay extra. It’s an all inclusive holiday hotel but you cannot stay at the bar until late. That’s not good at all. The hotel is clean and the pool area beautiful but there is no vibe in the hotel there is no holiday atmosphere. The entertainment is a joke. When you ask for an alcoholic drink in the restaurant it takes too long to come. We wanted to stay out late but it is not possible with the bar closed on holiday. That was a big let down. I want to feel that I m on holiday all the time.

We have contacted the hotel three times since then to discuss if they can refund us and they have never replied. We have called them and when I start to discuss it they put the phone down.    Given our experience with them I suggest other travellers choose another hotel and avoid the awful experience we have had with the Kenzi Rose.    The most annoying thing from a business point of view is that if and when we rebook our trip we would not think of using this hotel; had they replied to us then we would probably have rebooked.,Date of stay: April 2020,,"Southport, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhillipB378
Kenzi Rose Garden,Kudsia wrote a review Mar 2020,30,Honeymoon - average experience,We chose this as our honeymoon hotel as was close to the centre and 5 star. We went for all inclusive and expected a lot more but the lunch and evening meals were repetitive and lacked choice/taste lack of English meant the waiters didn’t understand our drinks orders or what we wanted. We chose to dine at the La Terrasse as a change at the on-site restaurant but miscommunication and lack of English meant we got charged a lot more than we expected. After complaining we received a free meal at the other onsite restaurant with a cake saying happy marriage in French. We also had more attentive waiters for our drinks and they made more effort with the English language. My husband also complained about the lack of choice for evening meals and they did provide a much better choice the next evening.  Decent hotel/ extremely clean and always smelling lovely nice for those who are keen walkers as can access everything walking distance but hotel needs to provide better service with food quality and options. There was also no proper entertainment on an evening which meant you wanted to find some elsewhere. Also insite gym/spa wasn’t available to us.

Kenzi Rose Garden,MrsR - World Traveler wrote a review Jan 2020,50,Excellent Refurbished Hotel - Beautiful Heated Pool.,The Kenzi Rose Garden is a beautiful hotel. It has undergone major refurbishment of rooms restaurants and most significantly the pool.    Works are continuing on the indoor pool and gym which are currently closed.    Reception guest relations and management are highly professional. We stayed in a newly refurbished suite which was luxurious by any standards. The room had all 5 star amenities robes  slippers TV AC  luxurious linen - tea and coffee facilities daily Comp water. Room was very quiet and comfortable - room 1304 has large wet room but no bath.    The Hotel was refurbished and also renamed in October 2019. This can be confusing. To be clear The Kenzi Rose garden is nothing to do with the Farah hotel next door which is substandard. Even some booking sites are confusing the two hotels - be cautious that you don’t accidentally book the Farah Marrekech.    The most significant improvement at this hotel is the pool. I have taken a few photos of the new pool. There are 3 pool. 1 pool is heated to 28’ - it is covered at night to keep the heat in. The largest pool is not heated and in January is cold.    Priced for BB are currently £80-90 night which is good value. Food is excellent- breakfast both Morrocan and European was very good.    The hotel have exchange facilities which are not dissimilar to local change offices- I’ve added the rates for 18/01.    I hope you find this useful.

While checking in reception staff delayed the check-in for 1 hour or more at the end they couldn't find the reservation while our reservation was already made and approved. They stated the dinner was not included while we did pay for it.    Reception staff are having difficulties making the process of checkin work properly.    Location just ok.    Rooms are new just refurbished.    Gym under construction still.    Cleaning is good.    Check out took time.    Overall we weren't happy with the stay. It could have been better.

Kenzi Rose Garden,Patrizia Amadei wrote a review Jan 2020,10,Bad experience. Avoid this hotel,I was there with friends for 3 days booked by internet. I asked for a written offer to stay 3 more days and I never got it. Just an hand written little paper...Jan 31st it was included. They talked about the gala dinner for the equivalent of 200 Euros without wine. I explained that we were not interested and they told us that is was mandatory. No way. An hotel cannot oblige a customer to do that. On top of it no care toward us bad manners from one lady at the reception. It's not a service we expect from a 4 stars hotel. Quality of the restaurant: can do better. Nothing to say about the waiters very kind and professionals as for the ladies of the rooms. Just this.Of course we left the hotel on Jan 31st,Date of stay: December 2019,,"Rome, Italy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amadeitraveler

Kenzi Rose Garden,Elaine W wrote a review Dec 2019,40,Nice place.,Let me start by saying this is a very nice clean hotel really friendly staff & smells fab but as advertised both on the website of the Travel Company we travelled with & pictures on here there is NO spa/gym/indoor pool!! It is apparently 'under construction' so if this is one of the reasons you will book this hotel then don't! We went AI and were very let down to discover that AI is in fact only 'meal times' no snacks in between those time you will have to pay! We did try for a 'snack' one day - pizza and chips and were told there was none! The drinks were served between 9am-11pm but an abysmal selection for AI 4 different spirits yes juice mixers very watery and no chance of a nice cocktail i.e pina colada/cosmopolitan! The drinks were at best 3*. The food is nice & there is enough but there isn't an extensive choice. The rooms are good and kept lovely & clean unfortunately I got a room opposite the noisy lift and asked to move the next day we were moved so that was good. The rooms have a complimentary toiletries and a robe in them which is very good and we used that to go to the pool in the robe and eat lunch all acceptable. The main pool is heated and is very nice there are a couple of other pools too but was the weather isn't too hot at the moment the others weren't used. The pool area is kept lovely and clean. There is an open top bus nearby for travelling around Marrakech.,Date of stay: December 2019,,"Derbyshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spiregirl
Kenzi Rose Garden,Madeline wrote a review Nov 2019,20,Unsatisfactory,"Myself and my partner stayed at the hotel for 6 nights. Unfortunately we did not have an enjoyable stay:    - When we arrived we were put in the wrong room. We booked all inclusive but there was no welcome pack and we were not informed of any information regarding where to eat. We had no idea when the eating facilities were open.    - The website says that theres a spa indoor pool and fitness centre on site. We chose the hotel specifically because of this to allow us to have everything we wanted in one place however they weren’t open. The website is misleading and falsely advertising the hotels facilities. At no point during the booking process confirmation email or when we arrived were we informed they weren't open.    -When we arrived the restaurants were not fully functioning. We did not see the snack bar and the all inclusive diner buffet was not available until the end of our stay.    -The food we did receive was limited some of which was below average standard. We had to go out for diner for more variation.    -The website says that the hotel was ""completely renovated"" however building work was still going on around the hotel. We could hear the building work going on in the corridor where our room was and had an angle grinder being used around the pool to open a door.    Had we been informed of the above issues we would not have booked to stay.    When we mentioned the issues to the receptionist they were unhelpful. I have emailed the hotel three times and there has been no response.",Date of stay: October 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/madeline08
Kenzi Rose Garden,Alecia wrote a review Nov 2019,50,Alecia,We stayed at the Kenzi Rose Garden for 4 nights we booked all inclusive. All inclusive enabled us to eat at the buffet restaurant only the food choice was amazing so much variation. We could also use the bar on the outside for drinks and nuts it closed at 11pm.  The rooms are beautiful very clean lovely shower and friendly staff. Fantastic pools lovely palm trees all around was only able to use it once as the weather was not the best. The location is amazing very close to the airport and walking distance to the markets and shopping area.,Date of stay: November 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/71aleciad

Kenzi Rose Garden,Ozgur wrote a review Nov 2019,50,Fantastic hotel with wonderful staff,Traveled all around the world and stayed at many hotel chains. We booked Kenzi Rose Gardens last minute and totally exceeded my expectations! Underrated hotel for sure.    Every single staff is genuinely friendly but very special thanks to Lamina with a constant smile on her face made the whole difference during our stay with her help.    Location is perfect  food is great.    Could add some variety to the music keep relaying by the swimming pool though!,Date of stay: November 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ozgurisik
Kenzi Rose Garden,Posh wrote a review Oct 2019,10,Rip off,We got there from agadir in the middle of the night say around 4 am. We were told to take our rooms on a rate which was double of the next day as we were unable to book it online due to it being after midnight. We were in a group of 27 ppl and needed 9 rooms. They wanted £1350 for us which was a rip off. Upon asking for 5 rooms now and 4 later on at check in time. We were told we can't sit invite lobby and have to leave the premises now this is something we have never come across in any of the hotels in different countries but morroco I must say is the only country where we have faced issues. It's a shame that it's a beautiful country but with very rude stubborn arrogant and insensitive people. We took 5 rooms and then said rest will leave but no that wasn't good enough for them so they took me with them and went to check each and every room to see how many people in the room. Humiliating upon finding no extras in the room they said you are a good person to tell the truth. It's a shame that they wernt good people in having faith in what was said by us. Next day We asked for allinclusive and was told that it's £75 for 2 people and for the third person of the room which is a child first we will do it free. Ok that's nice of you but woudnt that be included. When it came to paying and getting the road bands on the lady at the desk said only 2 people when I told her that her colleagues said it's for all 3 of us in the room she said NO! When I said it's not even been an hour and you've changed your word she replied and said well I'm changing my mind in a minute now and telling you that you can't have it. Then said either pay or leave. How rude. What kind of customer service is this? No manners on how to talk. I've travelled around the world but never come across such rude people in my entire life. Morroco is the worst country with no hospitality. Upon leaving we were promised to get breakfast early in the morning before departing for our flight. This wasn't provided. This time we wanted our way and said why haven't we got what we paid for. It was ok for you to take money beforehand but when it come to providing for the services which have been paid for you breached your contract. The only thing which was said is we can't do anything for you. That is all these people have done. No matter what you say to them nothing makes a different. It's a shame that we got ripped off and treated like dirt. Management pull your socks up otherwise your country will lose british tourists if this carries on.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Posh247
Kenzi Rose Garden,LAB1989 wrote a review Oct 2019,30,Finding its feet...,The hotel had only been open for 20 or so days following its refurbishment so some of what I say may be taken with a pinch of salt.    Upon arrival we received a friendly welcome and were treated to some Moroccan tea and pastries as is the custom. The check in process was slow (30 mins?) but we were able to check in to our room earlier than expected.    We were put on the 3rd floor and had to walk past some ongoing building work - but this was to be expected - and any noise we heard was minimal. Our room was clean with a modern feel to it. The shower was excellent. We had a nice view over the pool area. Although the minibar was empty there was no coffee/tea/water facilities and the TV choices were extremely limited. Breakfast was included in the room rate and there was excellent choice here as well as high quality.    The selling point of the hotel is definitely the pool area. This is impressive with a significant number of modern pool sun loungers including some double bed cabanas. There are pool towels provided and the shower toilet and changing facilities are great.    A disappointment around the pool area is definitely the cafe / bar terrace. The service is quite frankly shocking with staff bordering on laziness. Or just complete incompetence. Many seemed untrained in using the new tills or billing to a room procedure. Also many times I would be stood at the bar awaiting service and yet no one would appear. This was despite there being staff visible in the nearby area. It was almost as if they had an attitude of ‘not my responsibility to serve the bar’. Perhaps though not being served freely was a blessing in disguise as the bar prices are extortionate (see menu attached). I’d really like to hear a justification from management as to how 45dh (about £3.60) is a fair price for a basic coffee out of a machine? And how 40dh (£3.20) is fair for a small glass bottle of Coke? One final gripe around the bar/terrace is the awful music that they play. The hotel has gone through a pretty decent modernisation refurb and yet they’re still playing 80s/90s classics over the tannoy e.g Celine Dion Whitney Houston. I would suggest that if the hotel is serious about being a modern trendy hotel then this needs addressing.    Overall the stay was more positive than negative. No doubt with time some of these teething issues will be eradicated. The hotel is in a great location for all of Hivernage’s attractions (10 min walk) it’s nearby to the airport (100dh taxi) and is in close enough proximity to walk to Gueliz and the old town (20-30 mins). The hotel has modernised and its prices suggest it sees itself as a premier hotel in Hivernage. However they drastically need to improve the customer service and vibe on the terrace area as well as removing some evidence of its past as a tired and outdated hotel e.g the doors on rooms and the hotel lifts still look like something from the 80s/90s.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Worcester, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAB1989
