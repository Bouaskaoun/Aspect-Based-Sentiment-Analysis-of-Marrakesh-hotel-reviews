Riad Les Trois Mages,karen wrote a review Mar 25,50,3 days in Marrakesh,Wonderful relaxing stay at this Riad which is tucked away yet still walking distance to all the hustle and bustle. Aziz the manager is so helpful and informative with lots of really useful tips and great recommendations. The riad is very comfortable and the breakfast good and plentiful. All the staff are lovely.

Riad Les Trois Mages,David W wrote a review Apr 2022,50,The best Riad in Marrakech,Had the most wonderful stay at this Riad. Aziz Mustapha and the rest of Les Trois Mages staff just couldn’t do enough. We were looked after so well we didn’t want to leave. The food was excellent the rooms beautiful and the beds so comfortable. So we can highly recommend this Riad. We are returning in September for another weeks stay and looking forward to another wonderful holiday in Marrakech at Riad Les Trois Mages. I first visited Les Trois Mages 10 year’s ago. I will never forget my first impression on opening the Riad door. I had been invited into a different world and it still feels the same today 10 years on.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Rene C wrote a review Mar 20,50,1st time in Marrakech,Riad Les Trois Mages is amazing. The manager Aziz and the staff were gracious and kind. Aziz was the ultimate host and was in contact with me from the moment I made the reservation at my arrival and through out my stay. I was taken care of day and night. My every need was met and exceeded expectations. The Riad was close to great local restaurants quite and has a roof top pool which I enjoyed.,Date of stay: March 2023,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I2073ZIrenec
Riad Les Trois Mages,Elliot B wrote a review Mar 19,50,Amazing riad. Definitely reccomend!,We would highly reccomend this riad. The transport was arranged from the airport upon arrival which took us straight to the riad only a short distance from the airport. Aziz the manager greeted us upon arrival and gave us information on marrakech and anything we needed to know about our stay. We booked day trips to the Atlas Mountains and Essaouira which were very well organised trips that we won't forget. The riad itself is beautiful and a nice sanctuary which is perfect to come back to when you want to relax. We can't say enough about how nice the staff are at the riad they truly made the stay memorable with their generosity positivity and kindness throughout our stay. Everyone was so helpful and always greeted us with a smile on their face. Thank you very much Aziz Eli…,Date of stay: March 2023,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3542YBelliotb
Riad Les Trois Mages,claudia c wrote a review Mar 18,50,The perfect stay,The Riad was the perfect tranquil spot to come back to after a day exploring the busy streets of Marrakesh. We stayed in the suite for a week which was an incredible experience I’d recommend to anyone the bed was amazing and it was so nice having the extra space that came with it. Breakfast was always a highlight of our day so much delicious fresh food that we would enjoy in one of the comfy seating areas around the Riad. The location was perfect near to everything but off the main streets. Everyone working there was so kind and helpful and made us feel so welcome with lots of useful information and tea and coffee whenever we liked. I will definitely be back if I visit Marrakesh again and recommend to anyone visiting :),Date of stay: March 2023,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claudiaacchurch88
Riad Les Trois Mages,Sharon S wrote a review Mar 5,50,An oasis of calm,The moment you step into the calm and serenity of this gem of a riad after the chaos and craziness of the Medina and souls you realise you are in a special place. We loved it here especially after heading out to other accommodation outside the old city which made us realise how exceptional this one is. Aziz and his team couldn't do more to make our stay better. They exude the same calmness of the riad and do everything to make sure your stay is the best it can be from arranging taxis suggesting fabulous restaurants and sightseeing trips and welcoming my brother and poorly sister in law enabling her to rest. Our room was lovely on the first floor overlooking the beautiful courtyard and it's 2 lounges. Breakfast was amazing.

Riad Les Trois Mages,robinlindsaytj wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Perfect Stay!,We just arrived home from our first stay in Marrakech and it was exceptional because of the quality of service provided at Les Trois Mages. If I was able to give them more stars I definitely would. The Riad itself is gorgeous and spotlessly clean. We had a huge room complete with a very cool sunken bed sitting area and beautiful bathroom. There were also many sitting areas where we could lounge and relax outside of our room when we came home from exploring. We loved coming back to the Riad every day and heading up to the pool on the roof where we could relax and enjoy the quiet. It was very hard to believe that the hustle and bustle of the Medina was only steps away. So yes  it is a gorgeous place in an excellent location only steps away from the Medina however it’s the…,Date of stay: February 2023,,"Thunder Bay, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robinlindsaytj
Riad Les Trois Mages,Charles S wrote a review Feb 2023,50,A very friendly and cofortable,A well located riad close to the Souks and convenient to money changers ATMs  and licensed restaurants. Its location is within easy walking distance of the main sites of Marrakech. The riad is very comfortable the breakfasts are generous and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Aziz the manager is a mine of information and can arrange any trips you require. Best to get him to arrange their driver to pick you up at the airport as it may be hard to find first time. I thoroughly recommend it .,Date of stay: February 2023,,Singapore,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M1315BFcharless
Riad Les Trois Mages,Rodolfo W wrote a review Feb 2023,50,A magical stay in Marrakesh,Staying at Les Trios Mages will only make your stay in Marrakesh more enjoyable. The management is incredible friendly and guest oriented. You will be directly contacted after the reservation is made with tips on how to get and helping you to arrange any special activity you may want to undertake while in Morocco. The rooms are clean silent and dark at night so you can well recover from the days activities. The breakfast is one of the best you can experience with real freshly pressed orange juice delicious pancakes and excellent coffee. While at the road tee or coffee will never run out. The location is just perfect the car can drop you within a few meters and at the sometime you are in the medina!

Riad Les Trois Mages,Eliezer K wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Just wow… read on for more details…,Wow. Simply wow.  I understand that when reading reviews we all look for the same things. So lets get basics out of the way.  - super clean.  - super friendly staff.  - breakfast is great.  - beautiful place.  - hot water works.  - the toilets flush.  Simply put its a great place to stay. End of story.    We actually went to two different Riads and this was our first one. After the second we went back here. Why? Because they just hit the marks here on every level.    In particular Aziz (the manager) is extremely accommodating. He truly understands what hospitality means. If this place is double the price of another Riad I promise it is still worth it.    These reviews matter most when we come from countries in the EU and North America. It does not mean we all have to be snobs just have some basic things that make our stays better and allow us to enjoy experience and learn from the culture. Riad Les Trois Mages is a big step in facilitating this. Book it you wont regret it.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/884eliezerk
Riad Les Trois Mages,Kelsey M wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Best place you can stay,This place is hands down the best place to book. The hospitality is beyond what you would get at any of the other fancy riads. We stayed one night at a fancy Riad and it was so much worse then this place. The breakfast is amazing and the location is perfect. But truly it’s the staff that makes this place so incredible.

The Manager Aziz and the other staff were so helpful accommodating and kind. They always made sure we had everything we needed and more. The breakfast was the best one we had in our 14 days in Marrakech. The room we stayed in was adorable and they had heated blankets and a heater!

The courtyard for dining is airy and elegant and the music room with all the instruments and the piano is great- our son loved it. The bedrooms are comfortable and the bathrooms are luxurious. The upper terrace and pool are beautiful and a great place to have breakfast.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Helen H wrote a review Feb 2023,50,What a great place for a weekend away. First class service.,We have just returned from a three night break in Marrakech. Aziz was so kind and helpful. He arranged a taxi to meet us at the airport and was at the Riad when we arrived. We were welcomed with tea and cake whilst he explained things to do and see. We then mapped out our itinerary and he booked us a Souk tour of the Medina day 1 Atlas Mountains day 2 and Hamman day 3 all of which were great. He also recommended local eateries and places to see. Nothing was too much trouble. Excellent service. The Riad was very homely and tranquil and convenient for exploring. There were sun beds on the rooftop for relaxing plus rooms downstairs. The bedroom was spacious with nice hot shower and electric blanket. They provided tea or coffee whenever you wanted. All in all we had a lovely break away and felt really looked after by Aziz and the team.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helenhV7290CP
Riad Les Trois Mages,Barah Hassan wrote a review Feb 2023,50,"It feels like home, tranquility in the heart of the bustling medina",Upon booking Aziz the manager got in touch to arrange for us to be safely picked up from the airport and brought to the hotel.    The hotel is beautiful and incredibly well maintained with a beautiful rooftop and pool. The staff are attentive friendly and incredibly well spoken in several languages!    It was surprisingly cool during our time there but the staff ensured we had a warm space to relax in with heaters and electric blankets available as well as AC present for the inevitable hot summers.    Throughout Aziz and his small team were caring and helped us plan our trip highlighting the do's and don'ts of our stay. They helped us plan excursions and ensured we got a fair deal throughout. Moreover rather than staff looking after guests it felt like friends looking after friends staying at their personal home. I could not have felt more welcome.    The breakfasts offered were varied and very filling for the day and there was an abundance of tea's and coffee's always on offer.    Another big plus for this hotel is its location. It is in the medina within walking distance of pretty much anywhere you need to go both in the old and new cities.    If coming however I would say the hotel is a little tricky to find at first knowing the hosts however they would support any new visitor in assisting them in finding their way so do get in touch as soon as you've booked.    I cannot rate this visit highly enough if visiting the city again I would absolutely chose to stay here without hesitation.,Date of stay: February 2023,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barhas92
Riad Les Trois Mages,Kathy N wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Highlight of our trip - a top-notch amazing Riad,We absolutely loved Les Trois Mages. It was a wonderful intimate and relaxing Riad and we highly recommend it. We cannot say enough about the excellent service we received - Aziz the Riad manager was a kind and generous host who spent time explaining the layout of the medina and recommending places we would enjoy and we did! Said the night attendant was just as helpful friendly and efficient and we were always welcomed back with a warm smile and a check-in as to whether we needed anything. All staff made us feel welcome and comfortable. Breakfasts was a feast - delicious and served hot and fresh - we loved the traditional pancakes honey & preserves and warm milk with our coffee. The Riad was our sanctuary - the courtyard was a peaceful and welcome respite from the bustle of the medina and the seating alcoves around it were cozy and comfortable - great places to read on your own or chat about the day. Our room was on the 2nd level which I would recommend as it overlooks the courtyard and you can watch birds perch on the railings and foliage through the window. The bed was very comfortable and the room well-appointed. We tried a larger more expensive Riad later in the trip and we definitely found Les Trois Mages to be far superior in terms of service comfort and ambience. We didn't want to leave it felt like home away from home it really was the highlight of our trip. Thank you for making our stay so memorable.,Date of stay: December 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathynT1645ZY

Riad Les Trois Mages,dfeehan wrote a review Jan 2023,50,A Tranquil Oasis,We stayed at Les Trois Mages for four nights in the Balthazar room and our stay could not have been better. Aziz and Saeed are wonderful - helpful resourceful and entirely genuine. The riad itself is in an excellent location in the medina but just outside all of the chaos and it’s a lovely sanctuary to return to after a day in your feet. The rooftop is comfortable and quiet it was a bit too chilly to use the pool but it was a great place to sit and relax. The ground floor has plenty of tables and couches and the fire was always lit at breakfast which made for a very cozy start to the day. The cleanliness of the entire place is 5 star. Breakfast was a highlight with eggs fruit yoghurt bread and either Moroccan pancakes (top notch at Les Mages!) or crepes along with fresh squeezed juice and coffee/tea. Aziz always made sure to check in on us at breakfast which made us feel very well looked after. We stayed at the Four Seasons in Casablanca and they should take a class on service from Aziz and Saeed truly.  The WiFi strength is good the bed was comfortable the room spacious and the hot water plentiful. As others have mentioned finding the location is a bit tricky with Google maps but maps.me worked perfectly and the picture of the door in a previous review was helpful.  Thanks for a perfect stay we will be back!,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Denver, Colorado",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dfeehan
Riad Les Trois Mages,Per wrote a review Jan 2023,50,Outstanding service and hospitality in mythical Marrakech!,First time in Marrakech and what a stay. The riad is perfectly situated inside the medina but in a less stressful part. Easy walking distance to most of the points of interest like Majorelle gardens Bahia Palace Place Jemma el Fna and of course the souk. Also easy to join tours from this place with 5 min walking to pick up point Place Riad Laarouss.    Manager Aziz is without any doubt the most friendly and service minded hotel manager we have met. Night porter Said is also one staff we would like to highlight with his professional and genuine interest in helping customers. The riads service and hospitality is outstanding and a memory for life.    The riad only has 6 rooms but it also brings out a fantastic atmosphere. Rooms are like in a fairy tale and there are common areas at all three floors. Pool area on the roof terrace to enjoy a swim from May to October (to cold now) or sitting in the sun enjoying your breakfast or afternoon tea/coffee.    To our big surprise the riad is serving wonderful morrocoan food both for lunch or dinner if you order one day in advance    We stayed for four nights and went on one city tour fantastic one-day hiking trip to the Atlas mountains and an excellent half day cooking school with chef Khmisa.    Be aware that traffic in the medina is extreme and it takes at least a day to move more relaxed.    We will be back for sure!!!,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Campello, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ecoboy61

This is one of the best experiences I have had in a hotel (aka riad in Morocco). The manager Aziz is a very detail-oriented person so everything is perfect clean and organized. All the common areas are fantastic for seating and relaxing. Aziz gave us a map with some suggestions and how to return to the riad easily. He knows well the area and gave us great tips about how to enjoy Marrakech better and how to avoid scams and tourist tramps. We spent Christmas night there and he welcomed us into our room with a card and a bottle of Moroccan wine. Said is the night manager and he is an excellent pupil of Aziz. The breakfast was included and was delicious very nicely served at any time you want it. Aziz helped us find a hammam for couples. The first night we arrived at the riad it was hard to find the correct address as in other Medinas in Morocco the small alleys are a maze where it is easy to get lost.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Karolina W wrote a review Dec 2022,50,Unmatched hospitality and lovely Riad,We had a great 2 night stay at this beautiful Riad. Our room (Jade) was comfortable overlooking the central courtyard. There is a lovely roof terrace with pretty big plunge pool sun loungers tables chairs and chill out area - great place to escape the hustle and bustle of the Medina. The location is good close to the attractions in the north side of the old town and only about 10 minutes walk to the main square. There is a fantastic hammam/spa 1 minute walk away - definitely recommend a visit over there. Breakfast served at the Riad was plentiful and delicious fresh fruit yoghurt eggs pancakes jams pastries bread coffee fresh juice etc. But what's best about this place is the people. Aziz and his team are all super helpful generous and genuine. They helped us with transport from the bus station arranging hammam contacting our tour guides when we had no answer from them and generally made us feel very welcome and relaxed.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Toshi Omagari wrote a review Nov 2022,50,"Excellent staff, venue and location",It was our first time in Marrakech spending three nights at the hotel. The venue is located close enough to the centre of old town and distant enough from the buzz of the main streets. The staff and manager Aziz were all very welcoming and accommodating and they helped us make plans for each day. The place itself looks very traditional clean and relaxing; we didn't try the swimming pool on the roof but absolutely would have if our days were not packed. We didn't have any issue with wifi. The tool is equipped with air conditioner and radiator if needed. Excellent choice all around!  マラケシュは初めてで、このホテルには3泊しました。場所は旧市街の中心にも新市街にも徒歩で行きやすく、バイクの往来の激し表通りからも程よく離れており、バランスの良い立地だと思います。スタッフさんもオーナーのAzizさんもとても親切丁寧で、マラケシュでの予定を一緒に立ててくれました（英語または仏語）。ホテルの中は伝統的で雰囲気がよく、水回りもとても綺麗でしたし、水の勢いや温度も不満はありません。屋上のプールも綺麗で、旅行が忙しくなかったら入っていたと思います。またwifiも全く問題ありませんでした。砂漠気候で寒暖差も激しい地域ですが、エアコンとラジエーターも揃っていました。おすすめです！,Date of stay: November 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toshio789

Riad Les Trois Mages,junbuml wrote a review Nov 2022,50,Happily Marrakech honeymoon,It was really paradise to me nd my wife. Actually we are little bit tired for Marrakech’s exotic life. But “Riad Les Trois Mages” had get to be paradise and shelter to us. Especially manager Aziz was really kind and careful to us. We were so impressed to him and getting better becuase of him. Lots of staffs had served us fully but he could be a reason to decide to book this Hotel I think. I m very thankful all things I served. In short totally recommended.    정말 좋았습니다. 사실 저와 와이프는 마라케시의 정신없는 분위기에 완전히 압도되어있었고 심지어는 피로감을 느끼고 있었습니다. 그러나 매니저 Aziz가 신경써주신 덕분에 마라케시의 비호감들은 모두 해소  되었고 충분히 좋은 여행지가 되었습니다. 마라케시에 대해 고민하고 계신다면 매니저 Aziz 만 놓고 보아도 Le trois mages 는 모로코 특히 마라케시에 대한 충분히 좋은 대안이 될거라 추천합니다. 정말 감사했습니다.,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/junbuml1
Riad Les Trois Mages,LA_91210 wrote a review Nov 2022,50,Impressive hospitality,The 5 stars is for Aziz the host/manager. He has put thd standards in hospitality high that will be hard for other Riads to compete.    I can't say enough about Aziz. He even walked with us to our meeting point for our tour in the Medina on our first day of arrival which took 18 mins.    The next day on our return back to the riad in the evening we got a little lost around the area and I panicked so I called Aziz. He did come out to find us but by the time he came we already made it back to the Raid.    Aziz puts 100% into his Riad and he certainly made a lasting impression on Moroccan Riad hospitality up high in the pedestal.,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Los Angeles, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LA_91210

Riad Les Trois Mages,Hazel P wrote a review Oct 2022,50,"A beautiful hotel, an amazing host - a perfect place to stay",Les Trois Mages is a very special place to stay. The hotel is beautiful - our bedroom was lovely and the communal areas are really comfortable and tranquil. A real haven. But what made the hotel truly special was the sense of warmth and hospitality from Aziz and the staff at the hotel. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel so welcome. Aziz spent time talking to us about the local area and places to see. He had a map already marked out for us so we didn’t get lost when we went off to explore. Nothing was too much trouble or too much to ask. The level of service was beyond expectation. The food was amazing and really good value. And there were so many small touches that just made the stay special. I could not recommend this riad highly enough.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hazelpP4600LA

Aziz and Said made sure we were really well looked after from walking us to exchange money keeping us topped up with mint tea and checking what else they could do to help. They had arranged for a bottle of gin for our arrival so we could have a couple G&Ts on the rooftop before heading out for dinner.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Peter L wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Lovely Riad 5 star +,Staying at Les Trois Mages was such a good experience. The service was 5 stars +  We had booked restaurants from home for every night except the first night as we arrived arrived late to Marrakech so we asked the Riad to make dinner for us.  It turned out to be the best Moroccan food we had in Marrakech and we felt very special too.  Coming in to the Riad after a busy day was just so calm and nice.  Going up to the roof for a dip in the pool was so good to cool down adter a warm day in the souk  We will definitely recommend this Riad if you want to try authentic Moroccan hospitality.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Mairead D wrote a review May 2022,50,Family friendly oasis of calm,I have stayed at this riad several times and never tire of it. It is simply an oasis of calm in the madness of the medina. Les Trois Mages combines beautiful elegance tranquility and luxury. It is beside the souks & only minutes away from many attractions such as Bahia Palace Ben Yousef school Jmna elFna square etc. The breakfast lunch & dinner were outstanding. The ingredients were fresh and the flavours were unique. We had the fortune of being assisted by the Manager Aziz again whom I cannot praise highly enough. He recommended wonderful trips and fabulous restaurants. He was polite kind attentive and with great attention to detail. He is a unique and very special person! Thank you ! Abdel was so lovely and kind & anything we needed was never a problem. The Riad is spectacular exceptionally clean & very well attended to. Also it should be mentioned that the pool on the top mezzanine was a big hit as always with the boys. Les Trois Mages is a very family-friendly getaway.  The plants  palms & bouganville growing in the courtyard & around the pool are stunning. The staff always look happy and there is a sense that they are treated with integrity and great respect. Nejia the chefwas so kind & showed the boys how to make bghrar pancakes which were delicious! Just run now and book Les Trois Mages!

Riad Les Trois Mages,Martin H wrote a review Apr 2022,50,First Time in Marrakesh as a Family,Arrived at the the Riad from the airport and met by Aziz (wonderful and welcoming manager - served tea pancakes and other treats on arriving / also very kindly and efficiently sent on some forgotten bits of clothing to our next stop in the Atlas Mountains- always grateful for that my friend 🙏) Provided plenty of great advice about places to eat drink and shop as well as arranging an interesting 1/2 day guided tour of the city. Dinner on the first night was excellent with very generous and hospitable Moroccan portions and breakfast was voted “the best” on our holiday by the kids - lots of pancakes (yum!) and served by the delightful and attentive Mustaffa (big football fan 😁) What made the Riad particularly special were the aforementioned people and the location as it took a 15 minute walk to get to La Place but through more local streets (fab coffee spot on the way through and Cafe Arabe was great for sunset drinks and food.

Riad Les Trois Mages,ColleenH wrote a review Jul 2020,50,An absolute gem,After months of internet searching for the perfect riads for my first big solo trip abroad I settled on Riad Les Trois Mage for the first part of my Morrocan exploration and it set the bar high for the rest of the trip! It was my very favorite stay of my 3 week trip. They arrange for my airport transfer which made things so easy. Aziz met me at the taxi wheeled my bag to the road where mint tea and absolutely delicious cookies were waiting. We sat and chatted awhile as Aziz annotated a map to help navigate the medina. The next morning I had the most amazing breakfast EVER- the pomegranate topped yogurt was to die for. My room was full of character and super comfortable. At first I did feel like maybe the Riad wasn't in the best location on the very far opposite side of the souls from the square but the more I explored the happier I was with the location- easy access to the souks but far enough away from the craziness of the square. It was fairly noisy in the morning but it never bothered me and after staying in other Riads I just accepted it as that's the way it is. I would go back and stay their again in a heartbeat if I could. It was simply lovely everything I dreamed of. As a first time solo female traveler I felt completely at ease at the road and as I stated before it really set the tone for the rest of my trip. As far as things to do it is super close to the Secret Garden which I enjoyed stopping at each evening about an hour before it closed and you felt like you had the whole place to yourself.It was a hike but I successfully navigated to the Square and back on my own walking each day.,Date of stay: November 2019,Trip type: Traveled solo,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColleenHWisco

From pickup to the airport to tips on what to do when in Marrakech food and comfort this was an excellent Riad. The manager Aziz was friendly knowledgeable and always available to help. He greeted me with coffee gave me a tour of the Riad and provided me with a map of Marrakech that he used to show me the key routes to walk and main areas of the city. All of the  staff were incredibly friendly and very accommodating. My room was large comfortable and nicely decorated. The location is good even though it is on the opposite side of the souks from the main square it only about a 20min walk through a well trafficked and well lit area to Jemma El Fna or about three minutes to a nearby taxi stand. The free breakfast was very good as was dinner on the nights I ate there! Airport pickup and drop off was easy.

Aziz the manager is a lovely host and gave us clear directions so we had no trouble finding our way into and out of the souk area. The riad is a few minutes walk from the northern end of the souks and close to a cash point and area where taxis are easy to catch. We had dinner twice at the riad and the tanjia was the best meal we had during our week. The room (Jade) is beautiful and we were lucky to have warm weather enabling us to use the roof top for sunbathing. The staff were also good enough to bring breakfast up there for us.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Traveler wrote a review Oct 2019,30,very well-intentioned but rough around edges,"For Morocco Trois mages offered luxuries of actual hot water and excellent water pressure best hotel breakfast I had in two weeks impeccable cleanliness peace and quiet and good intentions.    Opposite end of Medina from main square. Must walk thru two vacant alleys with homeless people which I didn’t feel comfortable doing after dark (and wouldn't do at home) even though ""probably"" ok....When I tried to ask if possible to arrange for escort back to riad door at night I was simply told “marrakesh is safe” (um you're not tourist target and/or single woman). So each night back before dark.    Even with “full strong signal” WiFi can be slow (couldn’t post 30 pics after more than one hour) -- as was not uncommon in Morocco. Though I didn’t care about tv when booking I actually liked watching Moroccan tv on this trip - so would have appreciated tv if staying in at night for safety and with iffy WiFi.    Upon check-in I was not informed that first breakfast was not until 830. Night manager made breakfasts for me so that I could cab to Bahia Palace by 9a opening time to beat crowds (then on departure day to catch early train) - but now reading other reviews apparently never had their full breakfast. Best to go to nearby car park on your own and ask for metered taxi (instead of relying on riad-arranged transport which was both extremely rude and inflated).    After day in heat dust and grime only reason I came back midafternoon on day 2 was to shower and start to enjoy Bahia suite (upgrade for last night in Morocco not available previous night) but room still not ready at 345p. For almost another hour I was repeatedly told ""only 10 minutes” and had to repeatedly beg to pay for stay then for change. Mgr very graciously offered bottle of wine for this inconvenience (that I didn't actually have time to drink). Bahia AC is NOISY. As otherwise noted rooftop pool is no more than waist high (other hotel pools had deep ends and were mysteriously freezing).    Final meal at le jardin which then served worst tagine I had in Morocco (but at least offered 50% discount).

We were impressed with this lovely and quiet Riad an easy walk to the Médina. Khaled happily arranged our appointments for spa treatments nearby and also made dinner reservations at a restaurant we wanted to try.  Khaled spent a fair amount of time with us upon arrival showing us a local map and pointing out areas of interest. That was most helpful!  Our breakfasts each morning were made to order at our leisure allowing us to enjoy sleeping in a bit. Delicious fresh juice fruit yogurt and bread were set while we enjoyed fresh coffee. Eggs to order were offered but we were well satisfied with what was already offered.  We loved watching and listening to the small birds that have made their home in the Riad. Just delightful! The rooftop pool and quiet seating areas were most welcome after browsing thru the maze of streets and souks of the Médina!  We inquired about having some clothes washed as we had been traveling for about 10 days. They were happy to oblige and the cost was minimal.  Upon leaving again Khaled assisted us by scheduling a taxi and even walked us to the correct awaiting taxi.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Indira D wrote a review Sep 2019,40,Charming quiet haven,Stayed here at the end of my 10 day travels in Morocco as I wanted to experience the much talked about traditional riad stay. Obviously made the right choice in picking this place. Situated right in the middle of the old walled city with the hustle-bustle all around an entry from a small alley away from the main street leads you to this traditional and elegant riad with great care taken in it's decor and detailing. The central courtyad the relaxed lounges the terrace with a splash pool and uniquely designed rooms added to its charm. Moreover all main attractions are within a 30 minutes walk which was very very convenient.    The staff too were all super helpful and took extra effort to make us feel at home and indeed the experience is that of staying at a home rather than an impersonal hotel. Breakfast too was always a welcome treat and something to look forward to.  They also organised pick up from the train station and drop off to the airport saving us the trouble of haggling with the infamous Marrakesh cabbies.    Would definitely recommend .,Date of stay: September 2019,,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IndiraD_12
Riad Les Trois Mages,andyglasgow14 wrote a review Sep 2019,50,Once Again Magnificent,"This is the second time we have stayed at Les Trois Mages and this time was equally as good. The Riad is typical Moroccan and beautifully furnished. We stayed in the Bahia Suite as this visit was a 50th birthday present from my partner. The Suite really is superb with lots of room a lovely sunken bed and a large bathroom. There was plenty of room for a second bed for our 3 year old daughter. The staff really make Les Trois Mages special though. Khalid was extremely helpful and arranged taxis dinner reservations suggested places to visit and was also on hand to help out. We had lunch and dinner in the Riad and the standard was very good. Standards of housekeeping were excellent with the room cleaned and made up every day. a special mention goes to Mouhsine the night manager who really is the nicest man you will meet. He has a beautiful nature and like our last visit he helped us many times. Mouhsine - thank you. He was always willing to go the extra mile to help guests and everything he did he wanted it to be perfect for the guests. Even if the (free) bottled water wasn't cool enough he would go and chill it in the freezer. Mouhsine stayed on late on his last morning to ensure he could serve us breakfast to our liking before he finished his night shift and this was almost 10am! He even walked me to a local pizza shop one evening when we wanted to stay in and relax.  The location of the Riad is ideal as it close enough to walk into the Medina but not directly in the hustle and bustle. The mantra of - ""whatever the guest wants"" is loud and clear here. You can eat breakfast at any time you want eat wherever in the Riad you want (roof terrace was our preference) have free tea/coffee/water any time of day or night and have bookings made on your behalf without charge.  Overall another great experience at Les Trois Mages.",Date of stay: September 2019,,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andyglasgow14
Riad Les Trois Mages,Lincoln218 wrote a review Sep 2019,50,Oasis of elegant charm,We couldn’t recommend this Riad highly enough. It was our first stay in Marrakech but won’t be our last and we would definitely stay here again.    It is in the residential area to the north of the Medina and is therefore very quiet and relaxing. The pool area on the roof a fabulous escape from the hectic souks.    Khalid and all the staff were extremely helpful. We would recommend eating here too - we had both lunch and dinner and the food was the best we had in Morocco. Respect to the superb chefs!

Riad Les Trois Mages,teamwallace2017 wrote a review Sep 2019,50,Fantastic Riad Les Trois Mages,We had an excellent time in Riad Les Trois Mages. Situated in the north of the Medina it is an oasis of peace and quiet but yet within an easy walk of the souks and the main square. The rooms are beautifully appointed and all had air conditioning which was pretty vital in the heat of August. The plunge pool on the terrace along with the pool towels and recliners made for an ideal spot to do a bit of sunbathing and relaxation after a busy day bargaining in the souks. The sitting rooms were very nicely appointed - although we did not spend much time in them.    Aziz and the team were outstanding. Aziz took the time to help orientate us and made many sensible recommendations for eating and for visiting. The whole team in the Riad could not have been more helpful and accommodating.    The breakfasts each morning were sumptuous and ensured that we got off to a great start each day.

Riad Les Trois Mages,paalhd wrote a review Aug 2019,50,Perfect,We stayed here for our first trip to Marrakesh.  Everything about this riad is just perfect.  Location within a short walk from the souqs and Jemaa el-Fna.  They arranged transportation for us to and from the train station for not much money. The driver was very friendly and helpful and I would recommend everyone to take them up on the offer to get picked up at the airport or train station.  The riad itself is beautifully decorated calm and quiet. A perfect place to escape to after the hustle and bustle of Marrakesh market. It is like entering a very pleasant calm quiet oasis in the middle the heat and noise in the city. The pool and lounging area on the roof terrace is a life saver in the middle of the day.  Breakfast was delicious. Eggs pancakes fruit yoghurt bread honey jam fresh juice and anything else you might desire.  The staff was super nice friendly and service minded (without being pushy). They gave us good guidance on the city and sorted anything we needed during our stay. Always with a smile.  Thank you guys for giving us such a wonderful time in Marrakesh.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Guenther M wrote a review Jun 2019,50,Great hospitality!,I had never been to Marrakech before and had some dreamy expectations for my trip. Staying in this riad and its wonderfully exotic Bahia suite meant my expectations were exceeded. While not the biggest riad in the medina Riad Les Trois Mages is a quiet oasis after busy days in the medina.    The manager Aziz was terrific; from arranging my transfer from and to the train station; to explaining the medina and other sightseeing options; and to arranging several day trips and local guides which I recommend using.    And what a wonderful roof top patio where I spent many hours in the evening after a busy day enjoying the pool the mint tea and the soft sounds of an evening in Marrakech including the call to prayers.    Saida cooked me a wonderful Moroccan chicken tagine one night. It was so delicious that I asked her for some recipe tips and promptly got a tagine pot when I got home and made a chicken tagine dish.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Tunera wrote a review Jun 2019,50,Hospitality at its best,"We stayed here for three nights. We arranged transportation for 150 dirham (less than $14) from the airport. Driver was waiting outside of terminal with sign. Upon arrival were greeted by Khalid. Our room was not ready because we arrived early. we waited in one of the lounges and Khalid arranged for tea and small bites. Room was comfortable. The only thing I would add is benches for your luggage. We left it on the floor since we did not want to dirty the bench cushions. Also there is no TV. The place is lovely and well kept. After long days of walking we did enjoy sitting in the rooftop at night or in the lounge areas. We received good recommendations for dinner and our favorite was Kuizin - belly dancer and food. We did not care for Jardins - too busy and service can improved. The ladies that clean and cook are very nice and hospitable. The whole staff is what makes your stay very pleasant. The place is not centrally located but we had not problems walking here at night. The only issue we had was with kids trying to divert us from walking through a path due to ""prayer time"". It was a hoax since we had just came from the same path but turned back to check something out. You will also get people to go to special markets as you are coming our of the Mammounia (one person told us he worked there but it was not true). It was hot when we visited so bring a hat and umbrella to avoid the sun. Also ask people if you can take their picture and try not to photograph them. They will get offended even if you are not taking a picture of them but someone they are in the background. We walked a lot. First time and Morocco and it was pleasant one.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Omar wrote a review May 2019,50,Quite Simply Awesome!!!!!,I have never actually left a review on TripAdvisor but I felt compelled to do so after staying here. Marrakesh is not what I would call a chilled out holiday. What with the hustle and bustle of the city the array of spicy smells the mopeds and the crowds. That doesn’t detract from it being a amazing experience. However what really made the holiday for us was staying at this Riad!! Before we had even arrived Aziz (manager) arranged for us to be picked up by a taxi at a very reasonable price and had already emailed me to advise me on the best way to get currency and prepare for the trip. During the email exchange I had told him that it was my partner’s birthday on the Saturday.    From the very moment we arrived we were made to feel very special. We were greeted by Khalid (Assistant manager) and after a very early start we arrived at around 11am. We were tired and hungry but expected no breakfast as it was getting towards lunchtime. Before we could say anything Khalid gave us some lovely mint tea and offered us a full breakfast which was most welcome and unexpected.    Whilst we were waiting for breakfast he gave us a full rundown of the area that we were in restaurants to try places to visit and all the local tourist attractions.    I took my partner to Marrakesh because it was her birthday. I booked the Bahia suite. All I can say is wow what a room!!! So much space an amazing sunken bed so very traditional a big bathroom with an amazing shower and bath.    After breakfast on Saturday we went up to the terrace to enjoy the Sun and the pool. When we got back to the room they had arranged a birthday card a bottle of wine and had put some banners up for my partners birthday. They then knocked on the door and brought in a birthday cake with candles and sang her happy birthday. I was really blown away by the effort that they made and it really did make her day.    Both Khalid and Aziz are such genuine and friendly people and the Riad is an oasis and a sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of Marrakesh. I have stayed at some amazing hotels in my time but this really is very special.    The photos on the website do not do it justice. Needless to say I wouldn’t hesitate in recommending this stunning accommodation for any visit to Marrakesh. Book the suit it’s amazing!!    Thanks again Aziz Khalid and in fact all of the staff. You are ambassadors for the world renowned Middle Eastern hospitality.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oakwp
Riad Les Trois Mages,Alison O wrote a review May 2019,50,"Lovely riad, centrally located",Our expectations were well met! I agree with all the other great reviews this is a lovely riad and Aziz Khalid and team are wonderful. Khalid spent time with us when we arrived going over a travel route through the souks shared points of interests and even walked us a little bit of the ways so we wouldn't get lost on day one. The riad itself is really nice- it's quiet except for the chirping of lovely little birds (which we really enjoyed in the mornings) it's a great place to relax and the rooms are very comfortable. We spent afternoons on the roof sitting in the shade or in the pool and the staff was always available if we wanted tea and was great at accommodating early breakfasts when we had day trips. It was a great home base and we felt very safe in the area- not to mention it's centrally located a short walk to the shops to the garden and to the pick up spot for a lot of day tours.

In the direction of the money exchange is a very nice food souk where the locals buy their grocery. And further from that across the bus station is a fantastic supermarket to pickup local products.

Then you get to feel a unique atmosphere of the place and get to know the rest of the Staff Mr Hassan and Ladies who prepare your meals always smile and are so kind. There is roof terrace and a lobby/yard with tables and sofas a piano plenty of interesting books about Morocco and others where I spend every free moment seeping tea reading.

Riad Les Trois Mages,M2863PNsandrac wrote a review Mar 2019,50,You have got to stay here,We stayed here for 3 nights. What a gem of a find. I think my title says it all. We arrived around 8pm and had a pre ordered Lamb Tagine. It was beautiful and so flavoursome. As the riad does not have a drink license Aziz the Manager offered to buy in wine/beer for us. The Moroccan wine was lovely. We stayed in the Bahia suite which is decorated to true Moroccan charm. Along with a sunken bed it was cosy. I wouldn’t recommend the sunken bed if you have any walking difficulties or have any stiffness though. Breakfast was freshly cooked with lovely Moroccan bread and freshly cooked crepe-like pancakes. The roof top is very relaxing if you want to get some sun or just relax in the covered areas to read. The pool is small - suitable for a dip rather than a swim. The staff have to be complimented. Nothing is too much for them. We booked a nearby Hammam which I would recommend to try. Aziz even walked us to it so we wouldn’t get lost. The riad is near the edge of the Medina and walking distance to the souks. The main square is approximately a 20 minute walk if you don’t get lost but if you don’t want to walk a taxi can be called and it’s easy to get a taxi back from square (but negotiate fare first!). All in all I would recommend you staying here if you want top class service along with a true traditional Moroccan riad that is central to everything.,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Galway, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M2863PNsandrac

The staff bent over backwards to help up no request was too much effort from having breakfast al fresco on the rooftop terrace every morning to arranging for guides and transfers as well as the obligatory Sunset Camel rides.  They even gave my wife a lovely birthday card and complimentry bottle of wine during the stay.  The food was absolutely first class just ensure you pre book it as its all cooked fresh daily so they need to know what they need to order in. Please don't confuse this place with a standard hotel/restaurant affair you'd have beck home. This is a much more intimate place where you are looked after and treated like royalty during your stay.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Aramiak wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Perfect,The wife and I were here for a full week. I’d come back to Marrakesh for this Riad alone. I want to climb Toubkal in the future and I would make sure I returned here for a night or two whilst in the area if I do. It was perfect. The location is ace. The souks of Marrakesh are a magical maze but Les Trois Mages is positioned as such that you can walk a pretty straight line from one end through to the famous Jamaa el-Fnaa with minimal opportunity to get lost. We didn’t need to grab a taxi once. Even attractions outside the old-town like the Majorelle Garden was walking distance from the Riad. The pictures on TripAdvisor of the Riad don’t oversell it. It’s beautiful. And there’s something to the tranquil ambience of the place that can’t be captured on camera. I don’t know whether it’s the birdsong or the comparative silence to that outside but it has a lovely atmosphere. Most of all the service was unlike any my wife or I have experienced before. Anywhere. The whole team were so friendly. You couldn’t feel more welcome. Room was great breakfast and mint tea was fantastic and the social spaces magnificent.

We had excellent breakfasts freshly prepared by the resident cook who also cooked dinner if you wanted. We had an evening meal on our last eve in the Riadthe menu had very traditional dishes and it was difficult to decide which one to try as they were all tempting!! We were not disappointed our food was delicious.The Riad is in a great location in the Médina close to all the Restaurants Spuk and square.There is a really fantastic choice of really good places to eat .Again Aziz recommended and booked these for us.

Very clean very comfortable & even has a small library of books to read/swap and plenty of Moroccan travel books to browse.The Riad is so peaceful but yet is near the souks. Khalid went through the map with us after we arrived and gave us some really good tips & advice. All the staff were ever so helpful & friendly throughout our stay.

Riad Les Trois Mages,David D wrote a review Mar 2019,50,A home from home,A unique and beautiful stay which is made special by the warmth of the staff. On check-in the manager Aziz spent 30 minutes with us going through the map of the Médina marking out helpful landmarks and points of interest. We have never had this level of assistance before at any accommadation and it is much appreciated as you enter the maze of the Médina for the first time.  It is a perfect location on the edge of the Médina within a short walk of the souks as well as the new town and Jardin Majorelle.  The breakfast each morning is delicious and the dinners at the riad were as nice as we had anywhere and very well priced.  The room was beautiful in true riad style and the property has a great rooftop with a small pool for catching some sun or having breakfast or relaxing.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Tea S wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Perfect place to stay if you want to stay in Medina.,It was our first time in Marrakech so we relied on review of other for our accommodation. We found this place on trip advisor and were impressed that they seem to gain a very good review from previous guest bad at the same time with a sensible price.    It was a good decision we asked for airport pick up as our friend warned us about the warrant-like medina especially if we have never been. Unlike many Raid in the medina this riad can reached by a car well almost(1 min walk)    The raid is set in a quiet lane off a small road. The raid is small with only 6-7 rooms. Our room was on the ground floor and were initially worried about the level of noise in the morning but all the staff was very quiet and go on their business without any noise.    All the staffs were wonderful helpful and very accommodate.    We will certainly come back and not reluctant to recommend this riad.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teerabul
Riad Les Trois Mages,TrippyEdo wrote a review Mar 2019,50,As good as they say,Really outstanding management from Aziz Khalid and the whole staff. We felt we were in good hands before we even arrived and the staff were always there when wanted. It's more cozy than palatial (reflected in the very reasonable prices) and you probably won't want to stay in your room all day as ours had only a small window which along with the door provided the only ventilation but that's hardly a problem since the riad has so many nooks and rooftop spaces for lounging around. And you will definitely want to lounge around after battling the insane motorbike-donkey-cart traffic of the medina. Aziz will be there to take the edge off bring drinks and patiently listen to your tale of how Siri led you astray (use google maps instead he suggests or the paper map which he'll helpfully annotate for you) and bring you a drink. And when you wander out rather too relaxed leaving your expensive camera on the table Khalid will run after your taxi to make sure you don't leave it behind. Breakfasts are simple but excellent and our lamb tagine dinner was also delicious.

Riad Les Trois Mages,mbowden53 wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Looking for the perfect Marrakech location? This is it!,We wanted the authentic Marrakech experience and found it in this Riad. The location is perfect for exploring the old town and souks and easy walking distance of all the must see sights. However once inside the Riad the atmosphere is quiet and calm perfect for relaxing and the rooftop sun terrace and heated pool were a real treat.    The manager Aziz welcomed us with traditional mint tea and pastries and was most helpful with local advice. He booked us a day trip to the Atlas Mountains which is a must if you have time and recommended an excellent nearby Hammam. All the staff were most attentive and friendly and customer service was excellent.    The room and bathroom were large and comfortable and the food was home cooked plentiful and delicious. We had the best tagine of our stay here on our last night enhanced by a very pleasant bottle of local wine on the house.

Riad Les Trois Mages,KStevenson wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Perfect,This was our first visit to Marrakesh and Riad Les Trois Mages was the perfect base to explore from. It’s centrally situated within the Medina the old walled city which is a maze of hectic markets and activity.    The Riad was really beautiful traditional and tastefully decorated and the ambiance was lovely quiet within this busy city. Our room was very and comfortable and quiet. The Riad has lots of communal spaces to lounge about in and a lovely heated pool on the roof terrace. The staff couldn’t have been more helpful and gave us so much local knowledge that I feel we experienced a lot in the three days we were there.    Within strolling distance of the Riad was Jardin Majorelle and the Berber Museum adjacent to the new Yves Saint Laurent museum all well worth visiting.    The manager of the Riad also arranged a day trip for us to the Atlas mountains and it went really smoothly and was a highlight of the trip.    After a day exploring the maze of markets and busy pedestrian streets it was great to come home to the peace and quiet of the Riad and the food served was incredible.    Breakfast on the roof terrace with the sun low in the sky is a really good memory for me peaceful and quiet and then out into the hectic old city which starts as soon as you leave the door.    I can’t rate this place highly enough and it will be where we stay when we go back to Marrakesh for sure.,Date of stay: February 2019,,"Marrakech, Morocco",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ksn_1966

There was always someone available English speaking to help with recommendations and reservations. The room was beautifully decorated with traditional decor. It was immaculately clean and well equipped. The guesthouse has really nice areas to sit and relax including a courtyard lounges and roof terrace with pool. We really enjoyed eating our breakfast on the roof terrace. Breakfast was freshly cooked and included eggs pancakes bread fruit and yoghurt. The guesthouse offer complimentary tea coffee and bottled water at all times which is a nice touch. The guesthouse is within walking distance of the main sites but set a little distance away which is perfect because after a day in the busy city it's great to have the peace and quiet of this little haven.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Nottingham, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Christy11_01
Riad Les Trois Mages,Andrea M wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Luxury sanctuary in the Medina,We were treated with excellent service by all staff members during our 4 day stay in Marrakesh. An airport pickup was arranged in advance and we got into the Medina in a comfortable Mercedes Van late at night. The interior design of the hotel is very tasteful with color coordinated gathering rooms where you can relax by the grand piano or enjoy some quiet time. We had breakfast on the rooftop as well as in the riad - always very private and relaxing. The staff always asked how we would like our eggs and surprised us with small changes in the breakfast menu. Aziz showed us the map and was giving helpful advice. He also made dinner reservations for us. We stayed in the Bahia suite with plenty of room for our luggage a splendid bath room with shower and tub and the most romantic bed room. I liked the fact that the suite was equipped with a safe and plenty of outlets. We also took advantage of the rooftop pool (bathrobes were provided) to wind down from the busy souks and noisy streets. Within the riad we didn't hear any noise from outside. Quite amazing. We had a wonderful time here and would recommend it any time!,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sunnyvale, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andreamU5928GB
Riad Les Trois Mages,TWPaul wrote a review Mar 2019,50,A great stay,Loved this place it was everything previous reviewers had claimed. Great facilities with rooftop terrace for dining chilling out in the sunshine or indeed take a dip in the small pool plus numerous other places to sit and read relax whatever takes your fancy. Stayed in Balthazar as the Bahia was already booked.    A 10 minute walk from the souks about 20 minutes to main square. 20 minutes to Yves St Laurent Gardens.    Other than breakfast - a lovely spread of pastries and egg option - we only dined in on the evening of our arrival day and the tagine was very nice lovely - and unexpected - to be offered a bottle of wine to go with it. Otherwise we dined at various TA recommended local restaurants and enjoyed the experience.    Any 'points for improvement'? Well not really but do remember that roads are ex private homes and not purpose-built hotels. The only way this really makes itself felt is with noise you are aware of others around you. Not an issue with noise conscious adults but we were very aware when three small children arrived and started using the pool it did rather discourage us from using the rooftop terrace. Certainly not a big issue but to be aware of is you're used to quiet adult-only hotels....    Best point without a doubt were the staff. Without exception they could not have been friendlier and more helpful always going the extra mile to ensure that our every need was met. The owners should be justifiably very proud of all their people.    Always the decider would we go back?. In a shot without any hesitation. We haven't sampled any other Marrakech raids but this place is everything I think you could need at a great value rate.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TWPaul

Riad Les Trois Mages,DavidEllen wrote a review Mar 2019,40,"Attentive staff, great location",First and foremost: the hospitality.  We were greeted warmly offerred tea and made to feel very welcome upon arrival. That continued throughout our stay. Manager Azziz was very attentive to every need and was happy to arrange a guide excursions taxi run an errand on the street or provide us with whatever advise or assistance we required.    Les Trois Mages (the three wise men) is located just off-Avenue Lakza which is a main artery into the souk (markets) area and just a 5 minute walk out of the Medina.  The Riad has 6 rooms that are sufficiently comfortable. There is no noise from the bustling nearby streets. The only sound is the mosque’s early morning call to prayer which is hardly avoidable anywhere in the Medina. The rooms include a safe a blowdryer bathrobes and shampoos. A large bottle of mineral water is provided in the room daily.    Breakfast is simple but sufficient: coffee/tea bread yoghurt fresh fruit jam and honey and traditional pancakes. The staff was happy to make eggs of our choice.    The riad has a rooftop terrace with a small pool beach chairs and a lounge area. The staff was happy to serve water or tea on the terrace.    In all fairness we have to mention that there were some minor issues. The toilet bowl was leaking some water (temporarily solved with a towel but not fixed despite us mentioning this on two occasions). Also the bath tub /shower could use a curtain to avoid the water from splashing over and wetting the mat. We found the closet space a bit small for our taste.  All in all these issues were tiny in relation to the overall experience which was definitely very positive.    A special note.  Manager Azziz was aware that we were celebrating a special wedding anniversary in Marrakech. Not only did he surprise us one evening with a bottle of wine in our room he also had our room decorated and wrote an extensive and very sensitive card that made us feel very lucky and happy to have chosen this riad.

The riad is located within the medina and is about 20 minutes' walk to Jmaa El Fna and 20 minutes in the opposite direction to the Jardins Marjorelle with plenty to see along the way.

Riad Les Trois Mages,SimonP411 wrote a review Feb 2019,50,"Fabulous building, brilliant staff",My wife and I stayed at this Riad whilst on a journey through Morocco during February.  We decided that using trains and staying at Riad’s would form a central part of our journey theme and are awfully glad we did.    Our main advice and booking was aided by Andy and Dawn Rediscover the world UK. They work with “Plan-it Morocco” to make bookings.    For Marrakech we were very pleased to stay three nights at Les Trois Mages.  It is very cosy exudes true authenticity and is cosy. Breakfasts were delightful and it was the only Riad of the four we stayed at which truly understood the needs of a gluten intolerant guest.    They had a supplier of gluten free “breakfast breads” and they were all very good. Indeed it was hard to tell that they were not the ‘real thing’.    They take customer care very seriously and go to great lengths to make certain that their guests are orientated with the help of annotated street maps. This assisted us greatly.    They have a cook who seems to be able to magic the most lovely dishes in what is rather a small kitchen. I would heartily recommend eating here but be warned they do need some notice as all ingredients are freshly purchased on the day based upon specific menu orders.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Island of Gozo, Malta",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SimonP411

The Riad was in a great position and so beautiful - as a result you can easily dip into the Marrakech hustle and bustle and then retreat into this beautiful calm and comfortable oasis - a lovely contrast. The rooftop pool is a lovely touch too.    What makes this Riad so wonderful though is the truly caring and outstanding customer service from every single member of staff. Under the professional care of manager Aziz the team of five provide welcoming and attentive hospitality always with a smile.  The food is delicious whether at breakfast or specially ordered meals and Aziz’s invaluable advice on trips or just how to make the most of Marrakech makes all the difference.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Badrinarayanan wrote a review Jan 2019,50,Home away from Home in Magical Marrakesh with some wonderful Hosts!,Well where do I start?? We spent 3 nights in Marrakesh at this wonderful Riad. Right from the time we checked in the service and warm friendly nature of the hosts was fantastic. We were greeted with some fresh mint tea and delicious cookies made by the chef when we checked-in and the host Mouhsin explained all the required details clearly and patiently answered all the questions. On a particular evening when we were sitting in the charming lounge area downstairs we felt a bit chilly and Mouhsin immediately bought us some logs and created a warm fire at the fireplace. Coming to the manager Aziz he is truly a remarkable person! He checked on us every day inquired about our day and offered us some very useful tips. I had a small personal issue in Marrakesh and Aziz went out of his way to help translate with the required people to help solve the issue. Even after I left the Riad he contacted me pro-actively to check if I needed any help and even helped to translate on a couple of occasions. For this I remain truly thankful! The location is very good and within walking distance of the main square souks etc. Our rooms were very charming with a lot of character and there are several common lounge areas where guests can relax and have a chat. The breakfast had a lavish spread of Moroccan pancakes bread fresh juice home made yoghurt with fruits made to order eggs and tea/coffee which was absolutely delicious! Every evening when we returned after a long day of exploring the city and its delightful souks the fresh mint tea and cookies would be waiting for us.To summarize I have traveled quite frequently across the world the level of service warmth and the personal touch offered by the friendly staff of Aziz Mouhsin & others are second to none and made it a truly memorable experience for us in Marrakesh!!

Nothing was too much trouble for him including lighting the fireplace in our suite and giving my partner a card and gift for her birthday during our stay. Life in the Medina is fast paced and chaotic but an amazing experience. To have this Riad to come back to was fantastic.

Everything was first-rate: the room the breakfasts the accommodating staff the lovely open environment of the Riad including the sunny terrace. We stayed 3 days October 27-30 and then our last day November 8. We were picked up at the airport and taken back when we left.    This is a wonderful riad- decor sitting room spaces open patio and terrace. The manager Aziz was particularly important as he treated us like guests in his house.    Our delicious dinner in the Riad on our arrival after a full day of travelling was perfect. Even though our first day in Marrakech was rainy Aziz helped us get around in the rain and find a garden restaurant with a clear roof cover.    Our last day at the end of two weeks in Morocco before returning home was an opportunity to walk around and re-visit the Souks and Medina and again enjoy the hospitality of the staff..

Riad Les Trois Mages,Helen L wrote a review Oct 2018,50,A Gem in the Medina,When I began planning my first trip to Morocco I was overwhelmed by the choices. We were 2 women traveling alone and I wanted to feel secure in my planning. After reading many Trip Advisor entries I wrote to Les Trois Mages. The owner answered immediately and put me in touch with Aziz the manager who from that moment on  helped to plan a perfect stay in Marrakesh. Aziz arranged our airport transfer a guide for the Medina and a day trip to the Berber villages in the High Atlas Mountains.  The Riad is charming. Small very clean and nicely decorated it is a quiet oasis. Within a day of our arrival we felt as if we were home. We had two delicious dinners at the Riad prepared by Saida who shops during the day for the evening meal. Mouhsin and Abdou rounded out the team and were cheerful and helpful for any need that we had answering questions and accompanying us when necessary. In total we spent five nights at Les Trois Mages and I highly recommend this Riad to anyone traveling to Marrakesh.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Los Angeles, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelenL613
Riad Les Trois Mages,EmLiesel wrote a review Oct 2018,50,"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent!!!",Well where to begin with our review about this wonderful Riad. Firstly I was a little apprehensive about staying in a Riad right in the Medina but as soon as we arrived it felt like a home from home and it didn't even really feel like we were staying in someone else's property.    The Riad - it is in a really great location and right in the Medina nowhere in the Medina was too far to walk and we never had to use a taxi to get back to the Riad. The building itself is clean and well looked after. There are a couple of lounges to relax in with board games books and musical instruments (including a piano). The central courtyard is a lovely place to eat and unwind and the roof terrace is a lovely extra. One reason I picked the Riad over a bigger hotel was because this one has a rooftop pool. It is only small but means that you can relax on a sunbed and cool off in the pool and for me that was a big extra because being somewhere hot for 7 days I wanted/needed an area to relax with a pool but I wanted to experience a more traditional hotel rather than just a big hotel outside the Medina where you could be anywhere in the world.    Room - we stayed in the Melchoir room and picked it from the website. The only thing I hadn't looked at was what floor it was on and it was on the ground floor. This wasn't an issue apart from on a couple of breakfast times where other guests had opted to have an early breakfast and then chose to sit at the small table directly outside our bedroom door. When we had an early breakfast we made sure to eat at the table furthest from rooms and be quiet - others were not the same and maybe in the future early breakfasts should be served in the lounges/roof to be away from peoples rooms - this wasn't a massive issue for us as we are early-ish risers but I can see how this might annoy other people it is happened throughout their stay. Otherwise the room and bathroom was spacious clean and we really really liked it.    Food - I think that this is the hidden gem of the Riad. Breakfast every day was lovely and a good balance with fruit yoghurt pancakes eggs fresh orange juice (this was amazing!). I never ate everything but you would be very full if you did! We had lunch once and dinner three times and all the food was delicious. My husband even said one of the stuffed chicken dishes we had was one of his favourite meals ever! The cost of lunch and dinner was also so reasonable that we didn't mind eating there at all (whereas a lot of hotels we have stayed in B&B have charged higher than normal prices for other meals). The added bonus of inclusive tea coffee and water actually made a big difference for such a small gesture; being able to take water out with you for the day and coming back and having tea on the roof terrace was all lovely.    Staff - the manager Aziz was on holiday and was covered by Abdou Abdou was so helpful during our stay; always checking if there was anything we needed if there was anything he could do helping us with restaurant reservations and tips on the best ways to places in the Medina. He gave us a map marked up with all the key places we might want to see and we used this the whole time we were there. I have forgotten the names of the night manager chef and domestic staff but all were so welcoming and friendly and couldn't do enough for us.    We had a really wonderful stay at the Riad and the holiday went so slowly (in a good way) as we felt like we were relaxing at home. I would recommend the Riad to anyone wanting to visit Marrakech whether for a short time or longer like we did.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmLiesel

Despite not having pre-ordered any food we were given a delicious hot late breakfast. Aziz had the foresight to anticipate we would be starving to have been able to rustle up something so quick and lovely. We loved the rooftop pool and outside lounge.

Riad Les Trois Mages,sjs1776 wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Fabulous accommodations and service,As others have said this is a small charming riad in the old city. We can not say enough about the attentiveness of the staff. Marrakech can be confusing especially the old city which is full of winding alleyways motorbikes galore noise and many folks (including cab drivers) who speak only Arabic or Berber. Aziz the manager was extremely attentive helping us to settle in reviewing with us after breakfast (and what a lovely breakfast every morning!) our plans for the day making helpful suggestions and ensuring we knew where we were going and how to get there. The breakfasts were delicious: fresh-squeezed juice the best yogurt I've had anywhere fresh fruit eggs a different kind of local crepe/pancake every morning french rolls and croissants Moroccan mint tea or French-pressed coffee. We had dinner at the riad the first night and had the best lamb tangine we're had anywhere. The riad is organized around an open courtyard full of flowering plants and birds flying in and out. There are several sitting rooms one with a piano which open onto the central courtyard as well as a rooftop garden with a small pool. Our bedroom was lovely -- dark cool (had AC but largely unnecessary) quiet and great for sleeping -- and the bath was clean and commodious. Overall this was one of the loveliest places we've ever stayed and I can't say enough about the quality of service from Aziz right through to the night manager and the kitchen staff.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Boston, Massachusetts",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sjs1776

Riad Les Trois Mages,ArthurB61 wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Interesting Riad,I really liked this place for a short term stay. Unique location in the old city which was a little challenging to find and return to at times! Nice breakfast wtih roof top area to enjoy. We even had a private dinner that they prepared for us and was quite good and reasonable in the main courtyard. The Bahia Suite was just OK in my opinion as the bed was a little difficult to get into and out of being on a raised platform with surrounding marble! Had to actually sit down on the marble and swing legs into bed to enter and then to exit. However the decor was very interesting and Moroccan. The absolute best thing about the whole experience at Riad Les Trois Mages was the property manager. There was nothing too difficult for him to do for you. I am in the hotel business myself and there exist very few people as dedicated and as helpful anywhere.

Usually I visit alone but this time my family came with me and we all had the most wonderful time. On arrival we were greeted with a late breakfast and then Aziz the Manager came and went through all our trip plans and confirmed requested bookings. He had booked a guide whose English was excellent to take us on a walking tour and this was relaxed informative and fun and we visited places I had not been to before. Our restaurants were booked for us for dinner in the evening and due to Aziz’s diligence in checking reviews we altered a booking to another restaurant he recommended and it was absolutely a good choice. As this was a birthday celebration trip we had brought champagne and glasses were found for us the wine chilled and served on the terrace. Some of us had early departures but full breakfast was still served at 6:00 am! All transfer taxis used were very punctual and good quality.

On that note the breakfasts were delicious with plenty of variation every day. Aziz was so good at explaining what to see and making sure we didn't get lost. As opposed to some in the hospitality industry in Morocco he was genuinely nice and interested in helping us have a pleasant stay.

It's full of character and charm. When we were finished registering we had our dinner that we had pre-ordered since we were arriving late in the evening. Siad's cooking is devine! We ended up having all of our dinners at the riad!  Breakfast was just as delish as dinner! And everything is so fresh!  Our room was exactly what we had booked and met our needs!  Aziz the manager is fantastic! Takes the time to chat with guests. Is always there to answer any questions you may have. He was able to arrange a camel ride for us (something my mum had been wanting desperately do!) he walked us to the taxi area and waited with us to make sure we got in the right one!  He walked us to a shop and relayed to them what we needed and walked us back to the riad.  They were very accommodating and let us have a photo shoot at the riad!

Riad Les Trois Mages,Phil1975_10 wrote a review Apr 2018,50,"Wonderful Riad, can't to return",We spent an amazing few days here were looked after from the pick up from the airport to being returned three days later.  For those who have never been to Marrakech before it is ideal both on location and the advice and guidance given by Aziz.  Everyone who works here made us feel welcomed and we were looked after wonderfully.  The Riad itself is a serene haven  much needed after the amazing but overwhelming streets of Marrakech. We spent the middle of each day and evening on the roofwhich is clean comfortable and ideal to lounge around for an hour or two.  And the food is the best we had during our stay.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Punita B wrote a review Apr 2018,50,Felt right at home from the start! Lovely vibe.,We felt extremely comfortable at this riad. It's a great and central location. We walked to the medina Jemaa el Fnaa Le Jardin Marjorelle etc. from this riad. Aziz and the other staff at this riad do whatever it takes to help you. For example they made reservations for us at restaurants and spas they arranged for our transportation to and from the airport they guided us on how to spend our time wisely and what to be careful about and how to avoid crowds. They are super accommodating. Also we loved the morning breakfasts. The rooms are all very nicely decorated and each one has a unique touch. It's a really good riad for people who want to feel comfortable and aren't very familiar with Morocco so need some help with planning and navigating.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PunitaB7

Very kind helpful came to our taxi to escort us to the Riad helped us find a guide on short notice and attended to our needs. The attention was decorations in the Riad was impressive. We had the suite which was beautiful  clean and inviting. For older people who may wish for the suite the only caution is the bed is sunken and more or less level with the floor on an elevated platform. It could be hard to get in and out of for people with disabilities or who are older. In that case just choice any of the other rooms with regular beds.  Breakfast was lovely. The roof top area is quite inviting for lounging and an evening rest.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Geneva, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nutrinut

Riad Les Trois Mages,Eleanor S wrote a review Apr 2018,50,Great service and lovely accomodation,We stayed here for 4 nights in March. Its a good location just inside the Medina (so easy access to the new town) and around 10 minutes walk from good restaurants and the souks and the square. Overall the service in this accomodation was really excellent. As it was a quiet week after the first night Aziz kindly upgraded us to a suite which was lovely! Every morning we had breakfast on the roof terrace which is so peaceful and a perfect place to relax and just chill out which we did on the big sofas there for hours at a time! There is a very well maintained small pool on the terrace too which we didn't venture into but i was surprised at how clean and nice it was. If it wasn't March I would have definitely been in there! The food at the Riad was amazing. We had lunch once and dinner once and of course breakfast is included and the food was some of the best we had in Marrakech and great value. Although in the Medina alcohol is generally not sold Aziz made sure there was a good stock in the Riad for us (at prior request). The security aspect here is very good. There is always someone on the front door (which is always locked) and we were told we didn't need to lock our room which took some getting used to but actually was true! The general area was good too and we always felt safe. If you haven't been to the Medina before it takes some getting used to finding your Riad is in a little passageway behind a door in a wall(!) but once you get inside it opens up and is lovely and bright. We found the whole experience there brilliant. I would recommend spring as obviously the weather is more pleasant (not too hot) and the 'hassle factor' had not yet reached fever pitch in the square and souks. This Riad is a lovely oasis of calm no matter when you go though. Aziz and the staff could not have been more pleasant and we would definitely recommend staying here.

The bahia room had this sunken bed with steps up to it which was amazing and it was really comfortable. There was water waiting for us in the room and a safe (which was nice and wasn't in our other Riad).    There was lots of hot water and an AC in the room (not super necessary but nice in the summer I'd imagine).    In the morning we were greeted with breakfast and Aziz told us to keep the room till our flight (we were leaving at 3PM) which was helpful as we could clean up and chance before we left. He had a cab waiting for us when we needed to leave which was spacious and clean.

Our warm host – Aziz – made us feel so welcome that we actually left an excursion to Essaouira early to return to the Riad. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful - recommending places based on our personal tastes arranging transfers and excursions for us at a moment’s notice. This exclusive property is tucked away right off of the Medina’s main hub. It’s a refined mix of traditional and modern with lovely gathering spaces including a central courtyard; rooftop with a pool; private nooks to enjoy breakfast tea read or just relax.

Aziz greeted us with tea and snacks and his staff prepared a delicious lunch on the roof of the riad. We booked two rooms both were spotless and tastefully decorated. It's clear that they pay attention to the details not something that is true of most places. The riad is convenient to the hustle and bustle that is the medina but just off the beaten path to allow for privacy and quiet.

Riad Les Trois Mages,D82mouth wrote a review Mar 2018,50,Many things to rec. about this Riad.,Holiday family trip to Morocco with our two adult sons. It was our first visit to the country scheduled rather hastily and we didn’t know what to expect. Would we feel alienated? Should we be concerned about matters of safety or comfort? We planned a quick visit – 4 days – hardly enough for more than a taste. We would focus our trip on Marrakech. I did what I usually do when trying to get a feel for a place pre-visit. I read TripAdvisor deeply. That’s how I found Les Trois Mages.    The good reviews did not disappoint and I highly recommend so many things about this riad which are detailed below. I add our assessment to the thread in an attempt to help other travelers and am greatly appreciative of the advice and appraisals from the travelers who came before.    I booked two rooms for 3 nights between Christmas and New Years. Prior to our arrival I exchanged many emails with the manager Aziz. He helped identify the appropriate rooms for our group. We took the two rooms on the ground floor. They were perfectly fine and opened up to a lounge area/lobby which was convivial and allowed us a place to sit and chat together. Each room was equipped with heaters and electric blankets to provide relief from the desert chill during the winter months. A must. I would also recommend bringing a pair of slippers or heavy socks to wear. You will want to remove the shoes you wear about the city at the threshold of your room! The bathroom was fine and clean. The entire place had an old-world charm and was kept spic and span clean by the industrious staff. The rooftop offered a lovely dipping pool and several lounges on which to sunbathe. Aziz made sure we were brought tea if we wanted and during our last afternoon he brought us our luncheon to eat in the sunshine.    The Riad is in the Medina so you are right in the middle of the hustle and bustle though it is located down an alleyway so something of a refuge. Once inside you will find comfort and coziness.    Azzis arranged for our transportation to/from airport and for a tour of the Medina and a day-long trip to the Atlas Mountains. All drivers and guides were excellent. We had an excellent trail guide in the Atlas Mountains – had never been out of Morocco but could converse with our group in three languages! He brought us to his home to meet his wife (who was very nice but did not stray from the kitchen to engage with us) and his adorable son who was whip smart and practicing his math problems on his only toy – a chalk board. This day trip was extraordinary and we felt like we were really able to make a connection with the Moroccan culture. Most illuminating cultural day.    The food at the Riad is excellent. In fact the dinner we had at the Riad on our second night was probably our most delicious and we were eating at very good restaurants. I would definitely recommend dining at the Trois Mages Riad but you need to book at least the morning of because they will shop and cook your meal to order.    Just another shout out to Azzis. He is a real pro as a manager and super nice young man. He runs an excellent establishment. Allow him to suggest things to do and places to go. He will steer you in the right direction and take good care of you. Highly recommend.,Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,Rhode Island,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D82mouth

Riad Les Trois Mages,Viva M wrote a review Feb 2018,50,A wonderful stay!!!!,Due to a complication in my flight schedule back to the USA I had to stay an extra night in Marrakech; and boy I am glad that I did!    Before even arriving Aziz made me feel welcome by sending me an email almost immediately after I made my reservation. This was wonderful and I almost thought I was being punk'd (do people even say that anymore in 2018?) since I had made the reservation through Expedia. Anyway needless to say this made me feel comfortable since it was going to be my only night alone in a foreign country.    Upon arriving Aziz arranged to have a cab take me from my old Riad to les trois mages which was great. When I entered the Les trois mages I was greeted with a warm welcome from Aziz and he offered me my favorite Moroccan mint tea! So again yay! Love me some Moroccan mint tea :-)    Aziz then sat down with me and showed me the dinner menu asked what I wanted and then as I requested arranged an appointment for me to go to a very nice hammam that afternoon! Aziz also gave me a map and carefully showed me how to navigate the medina in case I wanted to further explore it!! When it was time for me to go my hammam appointment Aziz even walked me there!    My dinner was exquisite! I had the lamb tangine. Again the staff went above and beyond and had a nice fire going on and delicious food. I did not want to leave.    Last but not least my room. Anyone that knows me knows that I have a 'thing' about hotel rooms and I am very particular about them and especially hotel beds. Well I certainly did not have any issue here. The room was beautiful and comfortable and I felt like I was at home.    In the morning my breakfast did not disappoint by being a delicious treat and my cab was arranged for me on time to go the airport!    I have to say my last night in Marrakech was one of my best and a highlight of a very wonderful trip and this was largely due to Aziz and his wonderful staff! I want to go back to Marrakech just so I can stay at this wonderful place.

Riad Les Trois Mages,tippistravel wrote a review Feb 2018,50,1001-nights experience,A few days after we got the hotel’s booking confirmation we received an email from Aziz (the manager of the hotel) with all information about the directions to the guesthouse tours taxi services and Marrakech itself.    Just before arrival we decided to take bus 19 from the airport to town so we wrote an email to Aziz the day before. Aziz promptly gave us instructions on where to get off and how to find the hotel (it’s 10min walk from Bab Doukala bus stop). When people saw us walking with luggage they came and wanted to guide us to our place - especially kids. Fortunately Aziz already advised us on how to handle them as they may bring you to the wrong accommodation or as for money for the “guiding service”. This was the only time that we really felt harassed as those kids were pretty annoying to say the least. But once we arrived at the hotel we felt like we were in the other world.    Upon check-in Aziz welcomed us with mint Tea and local pastry his air of tranquility made us calm down very quickly. He gave us a detailed map and explained us the way to go from and back to the hotel including some recommendations for places to visits restaurants bars.    The Guest House is situated inside the Medina and it’s easy to reach every where by walking. The area was good and we didn’t have any problem walking around at night. Shops and restaurants opened quite late and there was always people walking at night.    The place was nicely decorated - moroccan style spotless cleaned and many area for you to sit and relax. You can ask for tea coffee any time. The staffs were very friendly helpful and hospitable.    Our room Bahia Suite was very well decorated spacious with a separate shower room. During our stay was a bit cold but they provided us electrics blanket which was very helpful. There was an air-con unit which you can adjust to warm or cold. Bottom line we had a very good sleep there.    Wifi in the room worked very well. There was a bottle of water in the room daily.    Breakfast was very good; fresh squeeze orange juice coffee tea fresh yogurt with fresh fruits freshly cooked egg bread butter and Jam. On our last day we had a chance to had breakfast at the roof terrace as it was sunny and sufficiently warm.    During our stay was my husband birthday i asked Aziz if he could help me to prepare a small piece of cake for my husband during breakfast next morning. He promised me. After we came back from our tour that day we found a bottle of red wine olives and a small card from Aziz. We were very touched.    Next morning we were at the roof terrace for breakfast and suddenly Aziz and his staff brought my husband a big chocolate cake with candles. My husband was very surprised and impressed.    On the day of our departure we arranged the hotel’s transfer service - we left the hotel in the morning and left our luggage there. The driver collected the luggage and then picked us up at the restaurant in the new town where we had lunch with a very nice Mercedes Vito. Couldn’t get any better than this.    We would like to thank Aziz and his team for such a wonderful flexibility and hospitality. We highly recommend this place.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Mighty Quinn wrote a review Feb 2018,50,I can't speak highly enough!,We had a first-rate experience from the reservation process thoughout our stay. The owner Anna promptly and happily provided detailed responses to our numerous questions and the manager Aziz made us feel at home from the moment we stepped in the door until we left.  He went above and beyond  going to the train station to get us tickets and graciously refusing to receive a tip. He was one of the warmest and authentically gracious people I've met and made the stay a very enjoyable and memorable one.  The cook Saida I believe was so warm and made us the best chicken tagine we had the entire trip.  The other staff were also amazing  giving us an authentic smile each time we walked by. We work in labor rights and could tell that they were treated well and felt valued. The breakfasts were fresh and plentiful with multiple courses of fruit  pancakes  eggs to order and tea brought up to to rooftop terrace or down to one of the well-appointed lounges downstairs. We stayed in the Badia suite and felt like we were actually in one of the rooms of the Badia Palace.

Riad Les Trois Mages,DrMajestico wrote a review Feb 2018,50,A little bit of peace in central marrakesh,A nice experience where they seemed to go above and beyond in terms of hospitality. Very reasonable very central. Peaceful in a city that is definitely not so peaceful when you step outside and start dodging motorcycles mopeds cars and donkeys. Very nice breakfast tea every afternoon. Very grateful for the tips they gave us which helped our find a way and also (mostly) avoid a scam artist. Only one caveat--the wifi everywhere in Marrakesh seems a little wonky and the internet here though better than most of the medina was also wonky at times. Went off a few times signal was weak other times etc. All depended sometimes it worked well.

Riad Les Trois Mages,nazarzaidi wrote a review Feb 2018,50,Great place,This was definitely one of our most memorable holidays. We booked three nights in Melchior and two nights in the Bahia suite. In between we did a few days excursion which we arranged through the Riad.    On arrival at the airport we were met by a driver who took us to the hotel and indeed this was the same driver who took us to the excursions. Riads are very common in Marrakech and include a central uncovered courtyard - which allows you to escape the heat during the day. On the roof they also have a small dipping pool with some sun loungers. It is lovely to dip into the ice cold water during the middle of the day when it is searingly hot.    We traveled with my fifteen month year old son and had a great time. Moroccans are very child friendly and this was certainly the case in the Riad. The breakfasts were very enjoyable and definitely a highlight. They offer home cooked traditional Moroccan meals for lunch and dinner as well. These were reasonably priced and we often availed of this option.    The excursions that we arranged through the hotel were also excellent. This included driving in an air conditioned four by four with our driver Mohammed. It included a visit in the mountains / gorges as well as night in the dessert (with a camel ride).    We really enjoyed the service from Aziz and his team.

Aziz the manager emailed us before our stay to give us some details of what to expect in the Riad but also tips for Marrakech. They arranged a taxi to collect us from the airport and although we had to walk down a short alley to reach the Riad Aziz came up and escorted us from the taxi giving helpful landmarks to find our way around.  The room was clean and beautifully decorated with a very comfortable bed.  The food was delicious with an endless supply of mint tea on request - no need to go anywhere else!,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lynnmR476US
Riad Les Trois Mages,Michael M wrote a review Jan 2018,50,"Cozy place, great staff",My wife and I stayed in the Bahia suite for 5 nights in early January - although this place is down an alley and a fairly good walk to the main attractions in the old city it’s well worth it. Aziz the Manager was so kind and helpful (so were all of the staff) that we felt like family. The Bahia Suite has a working fireplace and since it was chilly we made full use of it. It’s an old house and so don’t expect every modern amenity but it makes up for this with loads of charm and staff who do everything to make your stay enjoyable.,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hanoi, Vietnam",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelmA6684PE
Riad Les Trois Mages,Alex N wrote a review Jan 2018,50,Incredibly warm staff and Fantastic Riad,I've done quite a bit of traveling stayed in 1000's of hotels/hostels/etc and rarely leave reviews. From the second Aziz greeted us he was incredibly warm and welcoming (in the back of my mind I thought there much be a catch or an upsell coming soon). Nope I was completely wrong and he was just about the warmest most genuine and friendly Moroccan(human) you will come across your entire visit to Morocco. Everyone travels for different reasons but for me it's always been about the people and meeting people like Aziz really inspire me to be kinder and a more welcoming person. We had only planned to stay one night but we immediately booked to stay more nights at the Riad once we had returned from exploring other parts of the country. The Riad itself is beautiful the rooms are comfortable the breakfast and staff are all incredible. The location is in the medina but some might feel it is a little far from the main plaza but I personally prefer being a little farther from the main area's of interest. If you are reading this just stop hesitating and click reserve! I wouldn't consider staying anywhere else if I went back to Marrakech.,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Los Angeles, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexandern668

Riad Les Trois Mages,Jezrel S wrote a review Jan 2018,50,"Phenomenal staff, breakfast, and space",We arrived at around 11AM so pretty early for check-in. However the moment we arrived Aziz grabbed our luggage and invited us to sit at the courtyard. He offered us some drinks but ended up getting a MASSIVE spread of delicious breakfast that was just to die for. It was such a wonderful gesture after a long morning of travel.    Pros    + The facility is just amazing. It's oozing with character and charm. There is a music room with a piano and other instruments. There are also a variety of board games and books travel guides that were available to use.    + The rooms were fantastic. There were electric blankets and space heaters that came with it. Our twin room came with a small living area.    + The bathroom was great. My only minor complaint is that on our first day there was no hot water during the day which was a bit annoying. But the rest of our stay was fine.    + The daily breakfast was just fantastic. It was light healthy and refreshing. This was hands-down one of the best breakfast spreads I've ever had in my entire life.    + THE STAFF. Aziz is a gem. From the moment we met him I knew this was going to be a memorable stay. He was charming knowledgable and extremely helpful. He recommended places to go eat and see. He was also very interactive which was absolutely nice. He made sure our stay was perfect. The rest of the staff were just as wonderful. I can not say enough good things about the service at this Riad. Along with the breakfast it's more than enough reason to come back.    Cons    - WiFi was a bit slow and kept kicking me out of my phone. It was a little bit annoying since I had a lot of emails to send and work to be done at night so that somehow limited my ability to perform these tasks.    - Location was a bit of a walk from the main square and since it's a little far from the main street you have to haul your luggage to get to your transport.    Overall a fantastic stay. Without a doubt will recommend this place to anyone and will definitely come back. Hopefully the WiFi situation is better. I'm getting hungry just writing this review thinking about that breakfast spread and missing the amazing service. m,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JezrelS2
Riad Les Trois Mages,jenniferobrien82 wrote a review Jan 2018,50,Amazing riad in the Northern Medina,I have been raving about this riad since we left. Aziz and all of the staff at the Riad Les Trois Mages were incredibly helpful and attentive. From arranging cars for us to keeping track of our schedule and helping us make reservations they were outstanding. The facility is beautiful and located in the northern part of the Medina a little bit away from the craziness but still a pretty easy walk to everything you might want to do. All of the rooms face in to their courtyard in the traditional style and I was pleasantly surprised by how quiet and peaceful the riad was in spite of how noisy the city could be.  Make sure you order dinner in one evening - their chef who's name escapes me is an amazing cook and it's a great way to get home cooking in Morocco.

Everyone is going out of their way to make your stay as comfortable and enjoyable as they can at the same time they were never overbearing. We stayed at the Riad for a week and everyday we were looking forward to our breakfast and dinner at the Riad. The chef Saida is a fantastic cook! We ate outside of the Riad a few times in Marrakech and Saida’s cooking is still our favorite! We have a very sensitive stomachs so we always are very careful of where we eat and Saida’s cooking definitely took our worries away and was super delicious! Not to mention dining in a beautiful and tranquil environment of the Riad was a treat for us. In addition I had an asthma attack badly one late night and Mouhsine was on night duty that evening and he was very helpful and caring.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Ian C wrote a review Nov 2017,50,Outstanding riad in easy walking distance of centre of Medina,We stayed for two nights to round off a trip to Morocco that started with trekking in the High Atlas and summiting Jbel Toubkal. We had booked the Bahia suite as a little treat to ourselves after the trek and we really could not have asked for better.  On arrival the manager Aziz gave us tea in the courtyard and chatted about what to expect in Marrakesh and how to avoid bother what Riads are and how they came to be facilities and food at the Trois Mages and some notable things to do before showing us to the suite.  The suite was superb ('stunning' and 'gorgeous' were the words used by friends on facebook when we posted photos) beautifully appointed and very comfortable. Marrakesh is a noisy city yet the magic of a riad is that it somehow keeps the noise at bay giving guests a tranquil base to return to after the fun and madness of the souks and Place Jemaa el-Fna. Breakfast in the courtyard each morning was perfect for the day ahead - filling but nothing too heavy - fruit yoghurt bread and pastries and Moroccan pancakes and eggs if you wanted. For later the roof terrace (with its swimming pool) provided a very relaxed spot to catch up on reading.  Aziz also arranged transfer to the airport for us at a very reasonable charge.  Indeed I would like to make a special mention of Aziz - from his initial email contact after our booking to our arrival and throughout our stay he looked after us (and the other guests) very well (including leaving a complimentary bottle of wine in our suite when he realised from our registration form that my wife's birthday had passed the day before - thanks again!)  Not only would I heartily recommend the Trois Mages but my wife and I are certain that we will go back for more Marrakesh fun and this wonderful riad.,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iancV8443WZ
Riad Les Trois Mages,SVP17 wrote a review Nov 2017,50,I cannot speak more highly of this Riad :),My husband and I stayed at Riad Les Trois Mages which exceeded our expectations.  The staff were truly amazing - going above and beyond in every way!  The position was excellent and we were able to walk to all main sites.  Check in was smooth and efficient. Aziz went out of his way to explain all required details and prepare us for our visit so that we got the most out of our time marking all details on a map for our use including landmarks to ensure we didn’t get lost and patiently explaining all necessary details.  We were very appreciative of the offer to arrange a taxi driver to meet us at the airport (name on sign) and take us to the train station on our departure (fixed price and very economical).  The staff all went out of their way to ensure we had everything we needed and provided excellent advice.  Our room was authentic and exquisite - the highlight of our 5 weeks of travelling.  We stayed in the Jade suite.  Breakfasts were included and were wonderful.  Lunch and or dinner were available if pre-ordered (excellent).  Lovely rooftop area incl a pool and sun lounges.  All recommendations were exceptional including sites restaurants spa money matters etc etc etc  Lastly on our way to the train station I discovered I had left my prescription sunglasses behind (the taxi driver was unable to turn back to retrieve as he had another booking). When we arrived at the station I phoned the Riad and with very limited time the staff brought the sunglasses to me at the platform entry.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Nick wrote a review Nov 2017,50,Fantastic Riad and friendly staff.,My fiance and I stayed here from 31st October to 4th November 2017.    We absolutely loved our stay!    From my first email to Aziz about transfers from the airport I knew I'd picked the right place. His response came on he same evening.    When we booked we got an email quickly from Aziz with our booking confirmation and staying payment was to be made upon checkout of the Riad. It also included an information pack on lunch and dinner menus excursions and a map. The transfers from the airport to the riad were sorted in this email too upon receipt of flight numbers and times etc.    There were a could more emails which were responded too almost immediately.    On arrival at the airport we were met by someone holding up a sign with the name of the Riad on it and taken swiftly to the Riad. Took about 15 minutes.    We were greeted by Aziz with mint tea and Morroccan biscuits. I'd been told about the mint team but it was more amazing than I'd expected. Aziz sat with us for around 20 minutes telling us about the city where to go for sights and souks and restaurants. He gave us a map which he drew routes to the main square Jemaal El Fnaa and also drew landmarks on it so we could easily find our way around.    We stayed in the Melchior suite on the ground floor which was perfect for us. Nice comfy bed shower in a cool cubicle thing. Safe in the wardrobe aircon etc.    We had dinner at the riad that night - we had the Chicken pastille which was lovely! The cooks    We had breakfast on the roof every morning which was lovely in the run under the sheltered seating.    The rooftop was also nice in the evening after a dip in the pool lounging on the sunloungers.    Aziz had arranged a guide on our request who took us around the city telling us some history and also took us in the museums etc. He also took us around the souks to places dint think yu would see if you didn't have the guide like the leather auctions and into rug making shops. Be weary though if you do have a guide that he will take you around the souks who will try to get you to bug all their stuff... we did buy some things but we think the guide was definitely worth it. perhaps don't buy anything whist you're with him as the shop keepers add on commission to their prices to pay the guide.    We asked Aziz for recomendstions on restaurants and he suggested Le Jarden Secret which was sooooo good! Aziz is full of so much information about the city so take advantage of this!    Every afternoon and evening when we came back the staff made us mint tea even late at night too! Nothing was ever too much trouble everyone was friendly and more than happy to help.    There is nice cool sitting areas to chill in just off the courtyard which have a chilled and relaxed ambiance.    I would have no second thoughts to returning this Riad should we return to Marrakech and I will be recommending it to anyone who intends to visit the city.    So many thanks to Aziz and his team you made it so wonderful!

Saida greeted us with water coffee pancakes cakes jams etc and Aziz gave us a lot of helpful hints and tips on what to see and where to go. We were then shown upstairs to our room the Bahia which was spacious and nicely furnished in a traditional Moroccan style. There was a sunked bed which was very comfortable a sitting area a fireplace wardrobe fridge safe bathroom with WC washbasin hairdrier bathrobes towels shower and sunken bath.    Breakfasts consist of fresh orange juice fresh fruit and yogurt eggs various breads pancakes and pan au chocolat etc with tea or coffee. Lunch and dinner are also available but give some notice. On the first night we had decided to eat at the riad and ordered our meal before hand. It was delicious! Thank you Aziz for the wine!    There is a lovely sunbathing area on the roof terrace with sunbeds and towels tables chairs sitting area and plunge pool. We sat up there at night to read before going to bed. Downstairs there is a sitting room with fireplace books and games are available. In another room there is an electronic piano and other mucial instruments with music. In the entrance there is a wide selection of books maps and information on Morocco for guests' use.    The riad is within easy walking distance of the souks the main square the Jardin Margorelle the Saadian Tombs Bahia Palace Baadi Palace Koutoubia Mosque and gardens and most other must-see sights. Taxis are nearby as are some good restaurants. The door is always locked so the only people who can gain entrance are the guests and staff. There is always someone on duty.    This was our first trip to Marrakech and we found Aziz's map and advice invaluable. All the staff were so friendly helpful and eager to please. Nothing was too much trouble for them.    After being in the hustle and bustle of the town it was so nice to get to the peace and quiet of the riad to relax. It was our little oasis of calm in the cocophany that is Marrakech.

We stayed for 6 nights at Les Trois Mages and it was extraordinary. The place itself is gorgeous with lovely spots to rest and relax. We were welcomed with cookies and mint tea in a luxurious spot in the shade.    The Bahia Suite is AMAZING. I couldn't believe how beautiful and spacious it was with the sunken bed and its own sitting area. And loved the shower too! There was one day when the heat and my blisters combined to make me loathe to move that I stayed in the riad all day while my husband attended his conference. I was soooo comfortable! The AC worked like a charm (Thank G-d-- it was brutally hot!). It's also wonderful that unlike a lot of places we stayed it had a small fridge in the closet. So we could keep a little food there too. Later in the day it was lovely to go for a dip in the rooftop pool.    And I loved loved loved the breakfasts with Moroccan and French bread yogurt fruit and coffee. We could have it anywhere we wanted and we ended up moving around trying different spots. Layla who served us each morning didn't speak much english but it didn't matter. She was so sweet and eager to please. NOTHING was too much trouble.    That was true of all the staff. Muneer the night manager even made us ice cubes from bottled water because we mentioned that the water was always pretty warm.    Aziz the manager was always ready to help whenever needed whether recommending a cooking class (Cafe Clock was awesome!) a restaurant or just giving us directions. Even after we left when I needed a specific kind of receipt for our stay Aziz was quick to respond to emails and get me what I needed. The staff was always asking us if we would like (complimentary) coffee tea or water and if there was anything at all they could do for us.    As I said to Aziz at the time-- I do not understand why Les Trois Mages isn't a 4 star hotel-- it certainly looks and acts like one! I can't thank Aziz Muneer and Layla enough (and sorry it took so long to write this).

Riad Les Trois Mages,edward56fox wrote a review Sep 2017,50,Tranquil and comfortable,This Riad is exquisite; the rooms are all glorious; we were in Bahia the best but all others are fine. The food is lovely and the rooftop pool such a lovely way to spend the afternoon. We had a slow morning wandered into town saw a few sites rested on the roof and then enjoyed dinner either in the Riad or in a nearby restaurant. It could not have been a better week. The staff are so pleasant and friendly and the service is outstanding. We loved every minute of our week in Marrakesh and cannot believe there is a better place to stay.,Date of stay: September 2017,,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edward56fox
Riad Les Trois Mages,markchambers1960 wrote a review Sep 2017,50,An oasis of calm,In Marrakesh it's necessary to be able to get away from the noise and chaos from time to time and the ideal is to have a riad near the main tourist areas but tucked away and quiet. Les Trois Mages fulfils this perfectly and adds the calm and excellent service of Aziz and his colleagues.    The small touches also help UK plug adaptors supplied in our rooms for example. Another guest had a birthday one day and they made their evening meal a memorable one to help mark the occasion including a birthday cake.    The food is very good and the rooftop terrace with it's plunge pool is perfect for some relaxation before diving back into the city again. The rooms are kitted out well with good showers A/C safes and plenty of hangers in the wardrobes (a bug bear of mine!)    I can recommend this riad and it's friendly service.,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leatherhead, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markchambers1960
Riad Les Trois Mages,Helen C wrote a review Sep 2017,50,Heart & Soul of Moroccan Hospitality,Riad Les Trois Mages is a beautiful little sanctuary in Marrakech. What's even more is how the staff exemplifies the heart & soul of Moroccan hospitality.    I celebrated my partner's birthday there. Aziz the manager arranged absolutely gorgeous fragrant flowers in our suite. Then surprised us with a bottle of wine the next day with a Happy Birthday banner. The birthday dinner at the Riad was delicious and we all sang happy birthday with a French cake and candles. We felt like a small family.    The staff here puts heart & soul into their work. Even the way they place a dish in front of you they are like artists placing everything just the right place to show the aesthetics. This serene beautiful culture also makes all the guests honor and respect the place even more. Everyone is quiet and respected each other's space. So even when the Riad is fully booked I felt we had the Riad all to ourselves.    If you are looking for parties this Riad is not for you but if you are looking for a beautiful retreat and want to feel the essence of Moroccan hospitality this is the place to be.,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helencY6814VG

Riad Les Trois Mages,June S wrote a review Sep 2017,50,Fantastic introduction to Morocco,I booked this riad after the rave reviews it had received on Trip Advisor even though it appeared to be more expensive than many others. I wanted the first place that we stayed before our 13 day On the Go Best of Morocco tour to be a memorable one and it certainly did not disappoint. In fact it set the bar so high that none of the other riads that we stayed at came close. It was worth every cent that we paid.  The quiet and calm of the riad is in direct contrast to the hustle and bustle of downtown Marrakesh which is only a 10-15 minute walk. We had been warned by friends how it was impossible not to get lost in the maze of alleyways around the town but Aziz gave us wonderful instructions on the first day and we were able to find all the tourist attractions and return back to the riad quite easily. All of the staff are very professional yet friendly. Aziz speaks excellent English is font of local knowledge and the pride in his country shows. Nothing is too much trouble for him and he goes out of his way to ensure that your stay not only in this riad but in Marrakesh in general is a really enjoyable experience. Make sure that you experience at least one of Saida's fantastic meals. She has been trained in France and it shows in everything she produces from the delicious cakes for afternoon tea to the melt in your mouth shortcrust pastry in the vegetable flan or the delicious blend of aromatics she uses in her tangines. We sat and had a candle-lit dinner (competently served by the night guard/waiter) complete with wine and romantic background music and savoured every mouth-full of her delicious food (as an ex-chef and foodie I am not easily impressed). The portions of the food were so generous that we were not able to finish them and requested them for breakie the next day as they were too yummy to throw away.  The owners of this riad have exceptionally good taste in the style in which it has been decorated and even better taste in all the staff that they have employed.They are a credit to the riad and I hope that they are all fully appreciated.,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Doonan, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/662junes
Riad Les Trois Mages,katreasy wrote a review Sep 2017,50,Want to LIVE here,I can't say enough good things about this Riad:  Service?  Impeccable. I think this was possibly the best service I have ever experienced in all of my extensive travels. Helpful and prompt without being overbearing in the least. Aziz you are incredible.  Rooms?  Amazing. In fact I had booked the Melchior room originally as the website indicated that it had a bathtub. Upon arrival I discovered that the room just had a shower which was actually fine as the room was still lovely. But our hosts promptly upgraded us to the Bahia Suite for the rest of our stay. FYI: the suite is awesome and worth the small extra cost!  All in all the deco of this riad was so charming I would have been happy to call it a second home (or first. Who am I kidding?)  Breakfast?  Delicious plentiful and whenever you are ready to eat it. Amazing! A couple days we did not even eat lunch we were so full from the delectable breakfast.  Location:  Fantastic. Easy walk out to the Ville Nouvelle (meh) or the Botanic gardens (worth a morning visit) but just a few minutes walk into the souks where we spent much of our time shopping (aka bargaining) and wandering around. In a city as difficult to navigate as Marrakesh Old Town can be this hotel was always easy to get back to. And some days we couldn't wait to get back.    And the roof deck with pool (small but oh so welcome in the July heat!) was a wonderful bonus.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Kayla W wrote a review Aug 2017,50,Superb hospitality!,My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights during our stay in Morocco. We do a great deal of traveling and this has to be one of the most hospitable places we have ever stayed! We were blown away by the courtesy of the staff! We only had a short time in Marrakesh so they were sure we made the most of our trip by helping us plan out our itinerary. There are staff around 24/7 to help you if you need anything. The night guard was especially kind. He walked us half way to our restaurant on our first night to make sure we didn't get lost fixed our AC unit for us in the middle of the night after we accidentally turned it off and made an early breakfast for us on our last day because we had an early flight. I cannot find any of my pictures of the riad but it was beautiful even better than the pictures. The rooms were very comfortable this was the best sleep we had our whole trip.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Sandra K wrote a review Aug 2017,50,Amazing!,This Riad is just perfect. Aziz was friendly informative and so polite and kind. We were upgraded to the Bahia room which is incredibly beautiful; the bed was so comfortable excellent AC and free water tea and coffee provided at any time. We were the only ones staying so had the place to ourselves and were treated like royalty. Breakfast was lovely a superb meal was cooked just for us at any time we wanted it and they also gave us a free bottle of wine for my birthday. We had the rooftop pool to ourselves all day comfy sunbeds and towels provided. The Riad is in the Medina close to the main square the Secret Garden and round the corner from a small square where you can get a petit taxi to wherever else you may wish to go. It is a haven of peace and tranquility midst the hustle and bustle of Marrakesh.

The staff was so welcoming and made our stay in Morocco very pleasant. They went out the way to make sure we had a great first visit to Morocco (i.e. comfortable room great service recommending places to eat - even walking with us to help find where we were trying to go setting up our camel ride with transportation to/from). I know that other places may do the same but there was something special and more caring about this place.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Mom22ms wrote a review Jul 2017,50,"Fabulous place to stay, amazing staff!",Where do I start from our initial booking there was no question about the customer service - Aziz promptly responded and provided advice when asked. Upon arrival we had arranged for airport pickup and when we got to the road there was Mint tea and wonderful Moroccan biscuits. We met the great staff and had a fabulous dinner cooked by Saida - fresh fish salads and amazing desserts! The breakfasts would feed a small army - fruit yoghurt local pancakes crepes eggs and fresh croissants/bread tea and coffee. Also worthy of mention is the extremely pleasant Mohassain who is at the Riad overnight and always answers the door with a great smile! Our room was clean well appointed and comfortable. When asked Aziz also arranged for a tour to Essaouria and was extremely helpful in providing guidance on how to get to various locations and indicating in a map preferred routes and landmarks (such as the large palm tree or double arches! Extremely useful for those of us who don't read Arabic and given limited number of street signs we found this invaluable! We spent a couple of evenings in the terrace around the pool - very nice and a little bit of a getaway after a busy day of touring.

The riad is beautiful with plenty of lovely outdoor spaces a rooftop pool and air-conditioned rooms. Breakfast was included each morning with yogurt fresh fruit eggs pancakes juice tea and coffee. We were usually full until dinner. The location within the media is great; it's only a short walk to the souks and the main square and it's a good base for day trips to places outside of the city.  However what sets it apart the most is the staff. They were beyond welcoming and available to help us with recommendations reservations or mint tea anytime.

Riad Les Trois Mages,BoMoBill wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Should I be telling you how good this place is ?,We have just spent 4 fantastic nights here in what is a charming riad - with many lovely touches. We were there over the two days of the Eid festival - so some attractions in Marrakech were quiet but our time relaxing at the riad was amazing. One thing that sets this place aside from many other riads is the fantastic staff who we can't praise highly enough: Aziz Mousaine and Saida in particular who were so helpful with tips directions and even in booking me an amazing Hamam (if you haven't tried one do it!) Rooms are beautiful clean and romantic (Hotel web site gives an accurate reflection) and the pool on the roof is super for cooling off and lounging in the heat of the day ( it was over 40 while we were there.) The shared spaces are great too with musical instruments board games and a library. The location is brilliant for getting into the city and out for the Gardens and Palmerie. Breakfast is lovely and should set you up for the day until the evening - we will definitely try the in-house cooking on our next visit.

Riad Les Trois Mages,M A wrote a review Jun 2017,50,A Beautiful Small Riad with A Big Heart,My and my fiance have stayed here for a week and it has been the best part of our little break.    The service is the best I have ever received anywhere. Aziz Muohsin Najia Saida and Ashanti have made us feel at home all week.    This little riad does not offer a small service. The service was consistent throughout our stay. Everyone was fasting through out our stay with the temp averaging 39 degrees and never did it impact the service as we were always greeted with a smile from everyone. I struggled in the heat and can only give everyone my utmost admiration.    On our last day we ate our lunch and dinner in Le Troi Mage's and we could not fault either. In fact it was one of our favourite meals. The price for the quality is definitely reasonable. If possible I would highly recommend you eat a meal here.    We stayed in the Bahia room which was beautiful. It was clean and the bath was a mini pool. Our beds were made everyday and the room tidied.    I cannot recommend this little oasis of a Riad enough.

Riad Les Trois Mages,mehmet t wrote a review Jun 2017,50,5 star service in a 3*********** hotel,Where to start! This place was actually the shining light of our stay in Marrakech. The city is so bonkers and relentless yet coming back to this place of an evening we were able to unwind and forget all the chaos outside. The manager Aziz the night guard Mohsin Saida Ashanti and Naizma ( I hope I've pronounced these correct ) are all so welcoming and go above and beyond toake you feel welcome and safe. Aziz booked our taxis restaurants spa etc and ensured we had tea and coffee at all times. Mohsin would ensure we were okay in the evenings and would often make us a nice evening tea and still be there to give us our breakfast.  The location is perfect as everything is within walking distance yet you are away from the crowded souks and the dreaded jemaa el fna.  Aziz is always on hand to greet you have a chat and check that everything is okay. He's ready to assist at all times as is everyone else.  The rooms are gorgeous and each one has a different style. The suite is something else. There's a lovely little pool on the roof and loads of little chillout spaces on the mezzanine and ground floor. You can have the lively breakfast on the roof terrace and we also chose to have lunch and dinner on our last day cooked by Saida and the crew. The food was amazing we were very surprised by the high standard as we did ask for it at quite short notice.

Aziz & his entire staff could not have taken better care of us from the moment we booked our reservation to our final good byes.    The riad itself is positively beautiful. My brother father and I stayed in the Bahia Suite and it was incredible. The breakfast every morning was delicious and authentic and the staff who prepared it were incredibly accommodating and kind. They essentially mapped out our entire 3 day stay for us as well! They booked both a camel ride in the desert and a trip out to the Atlas Mountains in Imlil (highly recommended -- we had our own private guide as well) for us. We truly didn't have to lift a finger.    The Riad was very close to tons of sites in the city as well -- souks palaces gardens just about everything.

Riad Les Trois Mages,goyourownway wrote a review Jun 2017,50,Beyond expectation excellent riad with very good price/quality,"N31°38'115"" W7°59'612"" There are thousands of riads (houses with a courtyard garden) within the city wall of Marrakesh and on TripAdvisor many of them with solely 5 star reviews. These ratings did not help us with the selection. After selecting the highest rated riads judging their response on our email-booking request and looking at their websites Le Trois Mages offered the best quality/price ratio. We received a discount for direct booking bypassing well-known internet booking websites. We paid €74 per night including breakfast in May 2017.    We planned to take the train between Marrakesh and Casablanca airport but due to cancellation and repeatedly not communicating schedule changes by Royal Air Maroc we could not return in time by train to the airport. Bus lines do not exist where train lines run and the airport transfer service did not answer our email requests. We were left with hiring a car. Not our first choice reading all the horror stories about car hire in Morocco on the internet. CarTrawler offered us a small car from Hertz. Remarkably the insurance fee for no risk at all was more than the car hire fee. CarTrawler did an excellent job informing which documents we needed at the Hertz franchise in the airport to prevent any problem. Of course the Hertz franchise tried to sell us unnecessary additional insurance to lower the amount of temporarily withdrawal of MAS 14400 from our credit card. The new Fiat Panda delivered us in 2 1/2 in front of Les Trois Mages. The toll road expense was MAD 80. Staff from Les Trois Mages understood our transportation problems worked with us to solve these in advance and sent GPS-coordinates and a map to the car park. The night guard Mouhsin was waiting for us to park the rental car in a secure car park for MAD 30 per day.    The original riad is 200 years old but the present owners living in the United Kingdom renovated it very nicely after purchasing this property 10 years ago. It has 6 rooms with good photos on their excellent website. Two rooms on the ground floor and four on the first floor. The terrace and the pool are on the second floor. Our room called Jade on the first floor with ensuite bathroom was romantic decorated with nice stylish touches a four-poster bed - personally the mattresses were a bit too hard to be romantic - small couch two wardrobes - one with hotel safe - and a split air conditioner. The bathroom had an excellent large shower with nice smelling shower gel and shampoo and a hairdryer. An additional advantage of this riad is the width of their rooms. Some riads offer narrow shallow room the width of a double bed. Not Le Trois Mages.    Breakfast is served where you want it downstairs in your room or on the roof terrace with coffee tea yoghurt fruit bread and eggs in any form. Nice beginning of the day. Every morning Aziz the manager was present to answer questions and offer tips on visits to Marrakesh and surrounding areas. His explanation of the map of Marrakesh and the routes through the medina to the famous Jemaa el-Fnaa square was simple and effective. We never lost our way and the second day we walked with a sturdy pace to the square without any map like locals. We radiated confidence and no shopkeeper bothered us on our way.    All staff members (Aziz Saida Mouhsine Najia & Laila) did their best to make our stay memorable. They served tea on the roof terrace and offered us a cup of Harira soup. Service was very personal and beyond our expectations. Overall the quality/price ratio was very good. We wished we could have stayed longer but we had to return the rental car to Casablanca.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Thomas G wrote a review May 2017,50,Best Stay of the Trip,This was our favorite Riad of our two week stay. The service was excellent from start to finish: Aziz directed us to and picked us up from a parking lot near by and Mouhsine helped us carry our luggage back. Aziz greeted us with mint tea and gave us a map of the Medina to get around. We had dinner there the first night (by the way the couscous is huge so come hungry) and there Harira soup was the best we had in Morocco. One downside is they are serious when they mean you need to let them know the day before or that morning for food on the upside that means it's fresh and delicious.    As for the hotel there is an open courtyard in the middle with salons on each side. Also on top there is a terrace with a pool two tables and lounge chairs. They will let you eat wherever you would like so make sure to take advantage of the changes in scenery.

Everything was good especially the Moroccan Salad and Harira soup was excellent.  Besides that what makes this Riad special is the personalized service. When we brought back wine they set up the table for us and they would accommodate breakfast at the time or place of your preference. It was alway nice to receive a bottle of water when we were back from the walk around the city. Whenever we had questions Aziz or Mouhsine were there to help us.  The room was clean and very quiet and the air-conditioning worked well.,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Nagoya, Japan",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yukestar
Riad Les Trois Mages,aries0409 wrote a review May 2017,50,Beautiful Riad!,We stayed at Riad Les Trois Mages for our first two nights in Morocco. It is a beautiful place and we had wonderful hospitality. Aziz and his staff were very helpful in giving us information about Marrakech. I had told our tour operator that it was my husband's birthday that day and they had some balloons and a bottle of wine waiting for us in our room. We had dinner there that night and the food was wonderful. I would highly recommend the Chicken Pastilla! They also had a small birthday cake at the end of our dinner. The only thing I have to say is it was delicious but TOO MUCH FOOD for the two of us! Anyway we enjoyed our stay here very much.,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Saint Louis, Missouri",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aries0409
Riad Les Trois Mages,Ghadaswa wrote a review May 2017,50,Fantastic Riad with Great Personal Service!,"My brother and I stayed at Les Trois Mages before our tour to the desert. It was beyond my expectations with a great price! Aziz the manager went above and beyond in meeting all of our needs as well as flexibly assisting us with last minute plan changes. He helped us find a private and safe parking lot close to the Riad and picked us up from the lot to personally take us back to the Riad. I wanted a covered parking spot as we would be leaving the car for two days but since there were not any available Aziz made sure the parking lot attendant saved us a spot and called him when it opened up. He even moved the car for us so that we didn't waste any of our exploration time. Additionally we were provided with complimentary drinks throughout our stay. Aziz recommended several ""hidden gems"" in the Marakkech medina for lunch and dinner. He also provided a detailed map so that we would not get lost on our adventures in the old medina as well as highlighting the important sites of the city. We thoroughly enjoyed our time in this very clean and tastefully decorated Riad with a wonderfully welcoming staff. I highly recommend it to all and we will definitely come back!",Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Springfield, Virginia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ghadaswa

Riad Les Trois Mages,Richard M wrote a review May 2017,50,Lovely authentic riad on the north side of the Medina,We stayed for 2 nights just before Christmas. Be aware that nights here are cold at this time of year (and a riad is a traditional house built around an open courtyard) but we had a lovely warm room with electric blankets and a four poster bed. We ordered an evening meal for the first night when we arrived tagine naturally which we ate by a wood fire. Breakfast was excellent. Pancakes yoghurt fresh fruit scrambled eggs (boiled eggs are always hard in Marrakech) which we took sat on the roof terrace warmed by the early morning sun. Aziz couldn't have been kinder and his clues on how to navigate the maze of roads were absolutely essential. Its the wrong side of town for the main square but that is still only 15 minutes walk away. A calm oasis in the fabulous madness that is Marrakech.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Seán W wrote a review May 2017,50,I stayed with a group of friends at this magical Riad in April 2017.,The location of the Riad in the old town of Marrakech is very convenient especially to some of the cities best restaurants.    The Riad itself is beautifully maintained and well staffed.    The room was a spacious double with its own bathroom. It overlooked the atrium of the premises and was very comfortable and cool. It has airconditioning but I did not need to use it.    The main draw of this accommodation is the service. The manager and staff were available all day and night to tend to our needs. Tea coffee water and soft drinks were available 24/7 and included in the price.    The manager and staff were beyond helpful yet not intrusive.    The common areas are plentiful and very comfortable. There is a small rooftop pool with very comfortable lounge and dining areas. The pool itself though small was very useful for cooling down during the hot day.    This riad is an oasis of coll and calm in the hectic city of Marrakech.

Riad Les Trois Mages,linsolo wrote a review May 2017,50,Magical Trip to Marrakesh,A wonderful trip staying at the Riad Les Trois Mages that really made it a special holiday. Aziz and his fab team of Hazzan Saida( the amazing resident chef) Mussem & all were so hospitable & helpful arranging everything from taxi's restaurant bookings personal guides. They were also on hand day & night with cold water freshly brewed Moroccan Mint Tea or Coffee & a pleasant chat to enquire how our day had been.  Saida's skills in the kitchen were superb - some of the best quiche & the salads tagine & griddled chicken skewers were all delicious. You can eat & relax in the courtyard on the ground floor in one of the 2 lounges on this floor. I had fun enjoying the music room with its grand piano guitars lute bongos...  The Riad is sympathetically designed in a traditional yet contemporary Moroccan style ( see photos) and was an oasis of calm away from the vibrancy & hustle bustle of the Medina.  The main square Jemma el F'na Souks Secret Garden Medina Gardens Majorelle (Yves Saint Laurent) are all within a 15 minute walk. I have recommended this Riad to friends and hope to visit again.

Riad Les Trois Mages,CTG1997 wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Perfect haven,My husband and I spent 3 wonderful nights at this gem of a riad. Aziz and his team really do run a wonderful hotel. It is a gorgeous haven from the heat and madness of the medina and in a great location. We arrived quite late on our first night so arranged to have dinner and what a treat! Beautiful food and plenty of it the same can be said about the breakfasts. Our room was very charming comfortable bed air conditioning plenty of storage fluffy towels robes etc. They also have a lovely terrace and pool on the rooftop - lovely to relax there after a day in the souks.    Communication with Aziz was very easy from before we arrived. He gave us lots of pointers and tips and arranged for a taxi to take us from the airport to the riad and back at the end of the break. He was very helpful about providing information and recommending restaurants while we were in Marrakech. On our second full day we had a trip to the Atlas mountains organised by Aziz. The driver we had for the day was very good and we had a lovely day seeing a very different part of Morocco.

Riad Les Trois Mages,gemmafradin wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Best hotel experience ever!,I can't recommend Riad Les Trois Mages enough! It's a beautiful peaceful haven within the Medina but easy walking distance to all the key sites. We stayed in the Melchior room just off the courtyard - it was beautifully decorated in traditional Moroccan style and was very clean. Aziz (hotel manager) was extremely helpful both before and during our stay. He organised a taxi to and from the airport and sent us details of possible excursions - we went on a half day tour of the Medina with Jouad on the first morning of our stay which helped us orient ourselves in the Medina and souks and gain confidence to go it alone! He also had very colourful personal stories to accompany his commentary on the Bahia Palace. His English was excellent too! On our second day we went on the Berber Village - Atlas Mountains tour which was a wonderful way to explore the stunning countryside including a walk up to the top of a beautiful waterfall a tour of a typical Berber house Argan oil/jewellry purchases directly from the Berber artisans for a much cheaper price than the souks in Marrakesh and a very memorable camel ride! Breakfast at the riad is delicious and plentiful - fruit yoghurt freshly squeezed orange juice pancakes French pastries and bread (plus eggs on request). Free mineral water and mint tea are available on request. Aziz is happy to recommend and book restaurants and explain how to get there! The pool on the roof is a wonderful haven for relaxing after a hot and busy day in the Medina. I travelled with my daughter and hope to return with my son and husband too to this wonderful Riad. All this at a very reasonable price!

Riad Les Trois Mages,MarmyA wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Superb!,My family and I stayed at Riad Les Trois Mages for a week. If you're visiting Marrakech you should consider staying here. The staff was fantastic and the manager Aziz is one of the best we've come across. Very friendly and helpful. He made sure we had everything we needed from giving us advice to setting up dining reservations to having delicious mint tea ready whenever we requested. He also coordinated cabs to and from the airport. The riad was very laid back and beautiful with fresh roses out every morning and lots of space to spread out and relax. One of my favorite things to do every day was to come back to the riad to have tea and play games that were provided by the riad. They even coordinated for us to have dinner when we came in the first night after a late flight. The wait staff was very kind and accommodating. Delicious breakfast every morning with yogurt strawberries pastries eggs bread fresh oj coffee crepes pancakes etc. there's a nice pool on the terrace for swimming along with lounge chairs and beautiful flowers. Can't say enough about it. Moussain(sp?)the evening manager was also great. Friendly helpful and very accommodating. Rooms were a decent size with AC and comfy beds. Bottles of water mint tea coffee were complimentary at all times. Needless to say we had our fare share of mint tea. There's also a piano if you enjoy playing. Location was good...about 10 min walk to souks and restaurants. Watch out for shady folks trying to steer you in the wrong direction when you come out of the riad...but that's everywhere. Quiet comfortable stay. Really enjoyed it.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarmyA

Riad Les Trois Mages,Anjaneya wrote a review Mar 2017,50,Oasis in the Medina,"After a very difficult Spring passage over the Atlas (snow fog rain bad truck traffic - and resulting bad car accident) we reached les 3 Mages late at night - and instantly all the stress melted. We stayed in Arabesque where my wife took a warm bath while I sipped mint tea and dreamed of caravans in centuries past - this is how Marrakech must have felt after a three month camel trek from Timbuktu. An excellent nearby dinner recommendation completed the decompression stage.  Next morning Aziz helped us with taxi and bus arrangements on to Essouira but not before a wonderful breakfast and a change in our reservation for the return to Marrakech - no way we were going to top our experience at ""les 3"" so why waste the night elsewhere?  Upon our return 3 days later we checked into Jade - another slice of heaven! Another excellent dinner recommendation (different restaurant same perfect vibe for the night) another excellent breakfast and a surprise to discover the rooftop pool - how did we miss that the first time around?  All the rooms in this riad are wonderful (yes I peeked) - fantastic interior design (even the stairwells and keys encourage your imagination!) perfectly clean and absolutely silent all night long. Unlike other riads we stayed in the bathrooms are clean dry and pleasantly fragrant - no funky plumbing here. The entire staff is more than helpful. Food is superb. This is a luxury hotel experience at half the price and a far better location than the nouveau-riche tourist barns outside the medina.

Genuine Moroccan home-made food which the chef of the riad Saida - who's as discrete again as magical at her creations (the tagines are PHENOMENAL - we tried them all meat and vegetarian versions!!!) is served in the common rooms downstairs fireplace and jazz music included.

The manager Aziz speaks excellent English and gives you a map to help you find your way around and I trust him to give you the best advice. He will arrange tours for you or ring other tour companies to check on time of departure etc.    Most of the major sites are within 20/25 minutes walk from the Riad and most admission prices are less than £2 e.g. El Badia Palace & Saadian Tombs. The Riad is also only 20 minutes walk from Jardin Majorelle that will cost around £8 to visit the garden and the Berber Museum but it is worth it. We enjoyed a meal in the evening at the Riad but we also highly recommend Lattitude 31 about 4 minutes walk from the riad that serves top quality food at very reasonable prices. A fabulous 3 course meal costs around £25 plus they gave us a free drink.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Quey wrote a review Jan 2017,50,Wonderful family holiday,The service was impeccable with prompt help via email with Aziz even before we travelled out there. We were collected from the airport as arranged and arrived to mint tea at this beautiful Riad. The two living rooms and courtyard downstairs meant there was space for our two children (aged 1 and 4) to play although we spent a lot of our time on the roof terrace and in the pool. We stayed in the Bahia Suite which had the comfiest huge bed another bed and travel cot and still space to live in for the week also the bathroom had a massive bath and shower big enough for all of us! The layout of the Riad meant we could sit up on the roof terrace or downstairs once the children were in bed and relax with a glass of wine but still hear them if they needed us. All the staff were very friendly and attentive to our needs and would have arranged day trips had we wanted it. This was a lovely haven in contrast to the mayhem of Marrakech and a great spot from which to explore the city. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and cannot say enough good things about it. We would definitely come back again.,Date of stay: November 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,Liverpool,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Quey

Riad Les Trois Mages,missfrinty wrote a review Jan 2017,50,What more could you ask for??,I stayed at this Riad for a week and enjoyed every moment. The room was beautifully decorated comfortable and clean. The atmosphere was calm and the staff were unbelievably helpful and welcoming but special mention must go to Aziz. He made our holiday. Nothing is too much trouble for Aziz. Maps advice recommendations restaurant bookings information - he has it all. As a result we found our way round the Medina easily and ate in some fabulous cafes and restaurants. The Riad is in a perfect location and you can walk to just about everything from there. And the breakfasts were excellent! I would highly recommend Les Trois Mages to anyone travelling to Marrakech.

Riad Les Trois Mages,lmchimere wrote a review Dec 2016,50,A delightful oasis at a reasonable price,This little hotel is a gem in every sense of the word. Tucked away in a nondescript side street away from the crowds the dark carved door opens and you feel as if you enter into another era. The beautiful Moroccan tiled floors the intimate center courtyard the well appointed rooms all reflect the artistry of the Moroccan culture. After a very long journey to Morocco it rained my first day and my room was the perfect cocoon in which to rest. While I could write pages about the well appointed decor what MUST be discussed is the outstanding service. From the head concierge Aziz to the cook Zaîda the staff is nothing short of marvelous and almost miraculous. No request is too small and they seem genuinely happy not only that you are a guest but that they can be of help. The week before I had been in Morocco and had done a great of sight-seeing so Les Trois Mages became a great haven for rest and further explorations. The food was absolutely fantastic and it was better than ANYTHING that I ate in a restaurant while in Marrakesh. Breakfast is copious and delicious as was lunch but the dinners were outstanding. For such a small intimate hotel I was astounded by the quality of the cuisine--even my fish was beautifully cooked. Aziz will welcome you with a beautiful smile and warm personality--he makes sure that you are taken care of: from a massage to a great excursion to shopping tips. I simply cannot rave enough about this fantastic little gem tucked away in Marrakesh. Les Trois Mages is one a handful of hotels in which I want to stay again as much for the wonderful people as for the hotel itself. If you are okay with walking about 15 minutes to the old main square and souks this is a memorable hotel for your visit.,Date of stay: December 2016,Trip type: Traveled solo,"El Paso, Texas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lmchimere

The rooms are beautiful decorated with Marrocan furnitures and carpets. The staff was as always very kind and helpful.

Starting with a taxi waiting at the train station for me to being greeted by Aziz with mint tea and cultural/historical orientation and bottled water in my room through the balance of my stay I can very strongly recommend this riad to your readers. The accomodations were very comfortable. The food was wonderful. The service was personalized with close attention to detail. With Aziz' advice and map I was able to navigate the medina without any issues. I was pleasantly surprised with how quiet it was not only in my room each night but also in the central courtyard.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Casa62 wrote a review Nov 2016,50,Gorgeous riad that ticks all the boxes,We had booked the Jade Room for four nights but on arrival were upgraded to the Bahia suite as we were the only people in the riad. Our welcome here was very warm and friendly and we felt immediately at home. The Jade Room did look gorgeous but the Bahia was another level again with a bit more room. The whole place is charming and stylish.  We had already pre ordered dinner and enjoyed this on a table set up for us in front of the fire - a private dinner party. The food was delicious but the quantities are huge so be careful how many courses you order!. (we had the Marrakeshi lamb) A main for two is really enough for four unless you have a huge appetite.  We enjoyed breakfast everyday up on the roof terrace in the sun so relaxing. A wonderful Moroccan spread with the option of poached eggs a nod to western visitors. It was so pleasant it was hard to get moving and go exploring. The riad is inside the old medina and is close to everything.  It was great to be welcomed back with tea and biscuits after exploring and there was plenty of information and advice available to help with any trip planning. Aziz kindly booked some treatments for me at the Heritage Spa. Felt extra pampered on return by having dinner again in front of the fire. This time we had chicken bastilla. Saida packed up the leftovers for us to take as a picnic lunch on the bus to Essaouira.  It was tough to check out but we have booked to go back in January 2017. Hopefully we wont have to share the riad with anyone else!,Date of stay: January 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Brisbane, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Casa62

Even before we arrived the service was first class with a welcoming email and offers of arranging transfers which made our stay even more special.  The customer service the entire staff at Riad Les Trois Mages gives is top notch nothing is too much trouble.  We stayed in the Jade bedroom a beautiful room with a four poster bed and the little touches like the electric blanket (which was so needed at night) and the complimentary tea when we got back from a few hours of walking made our stay more welcoming.  It's location was great although be aware of the early morning prayers every morning something that anyone staying in the centre of Marrakech will be subject too as they have literally 100s of mosques dotted around the centre.

The room was spotless very well presented and full of charm.  The staff will provide you with free tea ( and often cake :-) ) at a moments notice with a genuine smile and breakfasts were lovely. Saying that a kettle in the room for that ""pre talk to the world"" cuppa would have made a welcome touch.Though I bet if had asked for one it would have magically appeared.  Location was just right for visiting old and new parts of Marakech .  We failed to notice the lovely pool facility when we booked so didn't take swim gear do looked so inviting.  No need to take a map Aziz provides you with a map that far surpasses one I bought to take and anything in any guide book.. Though as a tip we preloaded maps of Morrocco to our phone ( windows) and the accuracy particularly in the narrow Souk streets was totally accurate a welcome back up when you realise you are totally lost.

The staff bent over backwards to accommodate whatever we needed from day trips to the Atlas Mountains to a delicious breakfast on the roof every morning! Aziz was so helpful throughout the whole experience and advised us good places to eat and drink in the medina. The room was super exotic comfortable and clean with the addition of a four poster bed and lovely big shutters opening out onto the central courtyard. The roof is kept beautifully clean with white linen beds and chaise lounge dotted around a small but pristine plunge pool. We ate dinner on the roof the first night which was a delicately flavoured tagine followed by Moroccan pastries all delicious and great value for money.

Everything was super smooth - from the email contact before the trip to being picked up at the airport. Arriving at 9.30 pm we had a warm welcome and were served a delicious homecooked meal in the courtyard. Definitely the best Morroccan food of the entire hoilday.    What really stands out about this place is the service. Forget 5* hotels this place was warm and welcoming and nothing was too much to ask. 'oh you'd like some crisps we don't have any but we will get some' - 5 minutes later the drinks and snacks were served!    The photographs don't really do this place justice - it is even nicer than it looks.    there are a lot of Riads to choose from on tripadviser - I spent ages looking.

It's a lovely court-yard style Riad with all modcoms chill decoration (you want those lamps:) and with a just-right rooftop pool with umbrella's lounge beds azure towels & thick white bathrobes in the room) in a very safe location while close to everything. Manager Aziz & his attentive staff went beyond to make us feel welcome & the pampering lasted until waving us out when the airport transfer was there. The breakfast is more than you can eat (fresh OJ to die for fresh local fruit + yoghurt T or coffee eggs any style pancakes etc. etc.) served wherever you like: in the shady courtyard halfway on the verandah or on the rooftop in the morning sun with a view over Marrakech. We had the Balthazar room on the 1st floor which comes with an extra bed but we were fine in the large double 4-poster fitted with excellent bedding in every way.

We travelled with our 3 yr old daughter and Aziz and the lovely ladies in the riad were so welcoming and friendly that we have no hesitation in recommending this riad to anyone. Aziz was so knowledgable in advising us on suitable activities and places to go he really made our stay extra special. We had 2 amazing day trips to the Ourika Valley and Essaouria. Despite Aziz's great restaurant recommendations (and we can recommend Latitude 31 just around the corner) we found the food so good in the riad we did not venture much further most nights! Saida's food really does live up to other reviews descriptions.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Elizabeth R wrote a review Nov 2016,30,Children,My 11 year old daughter and I stayed here for 4 nights. Many riads understandably don't facilitate under 12's. All riads advertise themselves 'oasis of calm' from an often frenetic Marrakesh. I too expected this as I've stayed in other riads.    The first morning I was woken at 09.15 by 5 very young children including a baby. Their parents chatted loudly over breakfast ignoring the fact that they were in fact sharing accommodation with others. I was shocked that the owners have an open policy on children with no minimum age whatsoever. I exchanged many emails with the owner until she relented that perhaps they need to review their policy.  I had a very pleasant stay otherwise the building staff and food were perfect. However the first morning cast a shadow over our stay. This is my first ever negative review but I felt the owner was rather dismissive and abrupt in her emails and would not be happy to deal with her again.,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElizabethR619

The beautiful decor and the more-than-friendly-and-helpful staff was the absolutely best part of our 10 day trip to Morocco!  We started off with only 3 nights booking and we ended up staying in total of 7 nights lucky enough to be able to extend our stay. We tried 4 different rooms (because we hadn't booked in advance so Aziz was helpful enough to squeeze us in where they had a vacant room) and they were ALL beautifully decorated comfortable and spacious. The courtyard is quiet beautiful and with comfy corners of couches in the shade. We also spent a lot of time on the rooftop. We loved the tranquil of this riad in an otherwise hectic city.  But actually the best part of our stay wasn't even the wonderful facilities but the extremely friendly and VERY helpful Aziz and his staff.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Emily L wrote a review Oct 2016,50,A Wonderful Experience,This riad is located within the Medina in the midst of a residential neighborhood.

Aziz works diligently to make sure that you have everything you need and is willing to assist you in any way that he/his staff can. The food is delicious and they provide large portions. Breakfast is included and it can't be beat. The decor within the riad is lovely and it is quiet throughout the day -- even with the open courtyard.    Since this riad is within the Medina there is plenty to see and do. This riad also offers a range of tour packages that you can elect to take for a fee. We booked the half day tour of the Medina which covered the souks and several historic sites and it was well worth the money. Our guide was informative very helpful and provided us with details that we wouldn't have known had we toured and ventured out on our own.

All of the five rooms are Moroccan themed and very comfortable with bathrooms that I thought were wonderfully decorated. The aromas coming from the kitchen will make you want to stay for dinner one night as we did and it was one of the best meals we had in Marrakesh.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Theresa H wrote a review Sep 2016,50,Beautiful and relaxing place to stay,We stayed here for five nights in total. The riad was the perfect antidote to busy days walking around Marrakech or doing excursions to the Sahara - as soon as you step through the door you will feel relaxed and at home. The bedrooms lounges and rooftop terrace are all beautifully designed in a contemporary Morrocan style. Even if they were fully booked you would still have plenty of space to yourself. Things like hot water & air conditioning all worked well and it's in a great location (about 20 minute walk to the souks area felt safe).    Breakfast was delicious - fresh fruit pancakes and pastries - and we also had a great dinner there one evening. The staff are very welcoming and always on hand to provide advice. Highly recommended!,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/461theresah
Riad Les Trois Mages,Jaycee wrote a review Sep 2016,40,"great staff, old riad",The staff was amazing here. I was a couple of streets away called the riad and Aziz came out to meet me to take me to the riad. I was offered non-alcoholic beverages and cookies upon my arrival. Aziz gave me a lot of great places to try around the area.    I was there for only a short time because my flight was early in the morning. They served me breakfast at 6:30am and called me a car to take me to the airport. Everyone I met was very pleasant and helpful!    However the physical space itself seemed like it could use some work. My bath tub didn't drain very well and it was leaking on the bottom so water got all over the bathroom floor. When I reached for the bottle of shampoo there were some long curly hair strands stuck to the space between the cap and the bottle.    If you stay here you might also consider ear plugs. The walls are thin and you can hear everything outside of your room including prayer calls (there is a minaret close by) people walking downstairs (as the riad has an open courtyard like others) people talking in the room next to yours.    The room temperature is comfortable but there's also air conditioning if necessary. A safe box is provided though the riad only allows in its customers and your things will be safe with the staff. Bedding was extremely comfortable!    Overall a very decent stay!,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled solo,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/triceritrips

Aziz and his team went beyond everything to help and advice us. From delicious home cook meals and beautifully decorated rooms to useful advise and info on sights and attractions we really were cared for exceptionally.

From the moment I arrived at the airport I was so well looked after and made to feel at home. I had a fantastic driver who delivered me to the Riad where on arrival the night manager was waiting at the door ready to greet me. The staff here Aziz Mouhsin and Leila are the most wonderful and helpful people who go out of their way to make you feel welcome and help you with anything you may need. I can honestly say I have never had such attentive and kind service in any of my travels. Nothing is too much for these guys. On top of that there is an endless amount delicious coffee beautiful mint tea and cold water on offer at any time.  The Riad itself is beautiful the photos don't do justice. Very authentic Moroccan style with modern twists such as amazing air conditioning units in every room. Very clean and well kept. Great location too with just a ten minute walk to the big square souks and many other attractions.  Thank you so much for having me and I will most definitely be back.

Aziz and the other staff were exceptional kind and genuine making us feel at home and welcome in Marrakech. As we visited at a very quiet time of year (in July just before Eid) the Riad was quiet and we were upgraded for free to the Bahia room which was beautiful! Amazing Moroccan breakfast every morning on the roof terrace exploring the city in the afternoon followed by cooling off in the roof top pool before heading out again for dinner is an excellent way to spend time in Marrakech.

Breakfast was very good we also had dinner and lunch once. The couscous and the chicken skewers were excellent.    The best thing about the riad was the rooftop terrace and the plunge pool. I don't know where the other guests were but we never had to share the terrace and pool with anyone else! I would definitely recommend a riad with a rooftop pool as opposed to a pool downstairs in the courtyard like in a lot of other riads. It can get quite 'cold' downstairs and it is in the shade.    Location is good but you are not as central as other riads which are closer to the attractions.

We stayed here for just a night but were lucky enough to have two full days at this Riad.  From the moment we arrived off the plane and were collected from the airport we fell in love with it.  Upon arriving at Les Trois Mages my boyfriend and I were presented with the most wonderful breakfast - such a huge selection of pastries pancakes eggs typically morrocan sweets fresh orange juice and probably the best mint tea I had during my week long stay in Morocco.

He gave us lots of really great tips and advice and knew exactly where was worth a visit.  The location of the Riad is perfect be it on foot or taxi its really easy to find (once you've got the hang of it!) Its walking distance to some wonderful sites including Les Jardins Majorelle.    The breakfast the following day on the roof was absolutely perfect the roof terrace is decorated so nicely - I can not describe how kind and accommodating the staff are.  The room itsself the bathroom and the decorations of the place is just so special with every detail accounted for. ( I think we were in Saffron - again it's worth asking for a room on the first floor that leads onto the balcony rather than the terrace itself)    An example of their kindness is that after doing a bit of travelling around we were back in Marrakech and sadly couldn't afford to stay here again but emailed them to see if we could pay to use the pool (which is absolutely gorgeous!!! - pictures don't do it justice at all) buy drinks & food as it was so hot. baring in mind we were no longer paying guests at this Riad I got a rapid response that that would be no problem - we should just pay for drinks etc. After spending an afternoon there in the 38 degree heat and having lovely tea & cake! brought up to us they generously declined any payment - just an example of their hospitality and kindness at this Riad.

From organising airport pick ups to organising trips out of Marrakech with reputable companies as well as organising lunch and dinners in the Riad. Nothing was too much they catered for every need which was appreciated when your time is limited and you want to get things organised efficiently. The Riad evokes calm yet warm with the friendliness of the wonderful staff. The rooftop pool and seating area is perfect to chillout after a busy trip or shopping in the souks. The Riad is good for access to the souks and old medina and should you want to venture further Aziz and his team are only too willing to help inform and advise you of the best options available.

Its really worth it.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurenaharvey
Riad Les Trois Mages,MikeandSarah2016 wrote a review May 2016,50,The perfect place to stay,This can't be beaten as a place to stay right within the walls of the Medina in Marrakech. The staff are the best we have had in any hotel in the world always there when you need them but never intrusive. The food is first class and their is always plenty of it. Manager Aziz. will ensure you make the most of your stay by giving you local knowledge or organising trips. massages places to visit etc etc. The riad benefits by being small and beats a big impersonal hotel by miles.Breakfast on the roof in the Moroccan sunshine is the perfect start to any day!

Riad Les Trois Mages,Kerry W wrote a review May 2016,50,WONDERFUL STAY IN RIAD LES TROIS MAGES,We were recommended this Riad by a colleague and when we recently stayed here in Marrakech we were certainly not disappointed! From the moment I contacted them to book the service was professional and informative. Aziz and his team ensured that all our requirements were met to utilise our time in Marrakech. From organising airport pick ups to organising trips out of Marrakech with reputable companies as well as organising lunch and dinners in the Riad. Nothing was too much they catered for every need which was appreciated when your time is limited and you want to get things organised efficiently. The Riad evokes calm yet warm with the friendliness of the wonderful staff. The rooftop pool and seating area is perfect to chillout after a busy trip or shopping in the souks. The Riad is good for access to the souks and old medina and should you want to venture further Aziz and his team are only too willing to help inform and advise you of the best options available. I highly recommend this place the food we ate there was outstanding and cooked with love and care. It was a peaceful and relaxing stay - an oasis of calm inside the bustle of Marrakech. First visit to the city and wont be the last!! Love Love Love this place. Thank you RIad Les Trois Mages for making this trip so wonderful.

Though my flight was late in I was still served breakfast on arrival and when I was shown to my room it was everything and more. I had not stayed in the Bahia Suite before but it was lovely to be able to have an early morning drink sitting on my sofa reading or relaxing in the afternoon out of the heat but still with the sunlight streaming in. As usual there were fresh flowers and I even had my own little fridge for water or whatever in my case some special milk for my protein drinks.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Sarah Elisabeth wrote a review Apr 2016,50,Best place we have ever stayed,We spent 5 nights at Les trois mages this Easter and it was hands down the best establishment we have had the pleasure of staying in. We had had to extend our stay due to changing flights and whilst our original room was not available for the extra night the changeover was made effortless. The food is wonderful- we had the lamb tangia at 10pm on our arrival- the portion was generous and it was delicious. Breakfast every day was equally good- a choice of eggs a variety of breads and pastries and fantastic local jams and honeys. We stayed in the bahia suite and it was beautifully furnished (like the whole riad!)  The roof terrace is a wonderful place to relax after a day in the souks plus (we've since learnt unusually for Marrakesh) the plunge pool is heated and catches the afternoon sun. The riad is full of nooks and crannies to read or relax in and as it only has 6 rooms never feels full.  Aziz the host is what made our stay so wonderful! He is a fount of local knowlegde- booking us a exquisite couples hammam and massage at another riad- it was incredibly affordable compared to others we saw advertised and amazingly relaxing.he was always on hand to give directions suggest running routes make recommendations order in bottles of wine or just have a chat. He put all our fears on our first visit to Morocco to rest and we had an unforgettable time! We're already planning our next trip to Les Trois Mages and wouldn't stay anywhere else in Marrakesh!,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahlisl

We had an absolutely fantastic time staying in the Bahia Suite. The room was lovely with a fireplace for chilly evenings and a really comfy bed. The service in the riad was second-to-none Aziz is a wonderful host and his team are absolutely lovely and friendly as well. Breakfast was really good every day and was served to us on the roof terrace as the weather was perfect for this. We had dinner in the riad on our first night and the food was delicious and plentiful. It also happened to be my birthday during our stay and I was treated to a wonderful homemade cake as well as flowers and a card. The rooftop was great for lounging on a warm afternoon and the plunge pool perfect for a dip to cool down and relax in. We got some great advice about where to go in Marrakech from Aziz and had a really nice time at a hammam close by followed by a massage. The riad is a lovely calm oasis amidst the hustle and bustle of Marrakech a wonderful place to relax after some sightseeing or wandering around in the souks. It's about a 15 minute walk to the main square and to the Majorelle Gardens. Highly recommend this riad I would definitely stay again.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Travelerabound wrote a review Apr 2016,50,Great riad with helpful and attentive concierge service and rooftop plunge pool,Quiet beautifully decorated riad with 6 rooms and a central courtyard. Well place plunge pool on rooftop with many sun loungers and shaded areas to relax. We enjoyed traditional moroccan dinner and lunch made by in-house chef who aims to please. Our included breakfast of fresh fruit pastries yoghurt and bread made an easy start to each day. The manager Aziz is professional and thoughtful with his suggestions of activities (guided food tour through town spa hammam recommendations) and logistics (transfers) prior to our arrival and during our 3 night stay. Trois Mages was generous in allowing us to us our rooms for a late 7:45pm checkout for our very late flight for no extra fee.  Our teens the most critical of clientele loved this riad. If we had little children staying on the lower floor may be most convenient to avoid navigating the tile stairs. Strong wifi throughout the riad was a plus. Each room had heaters and electric blankets if needed. There are numerous British outlets and a few US adapters in our room. We found our first floor room and our teens main floor rooms comfortable and beautifully decorated.    We wish we would have exchanged minimal money at airport and waited for riad information about exchange bureaus around town with far better rates. The riad will take final payment for a far better rate (xe.com) using a number of currencies and a credit card. Dirham is best for shopping in souks. The location provides easy access to out of town activities like Berber village/two valley tour cooking class and souk access. Though it is a 15-20 min walk to Jemma al Fnaa there are many food craft shopping and spa hammams near Trois Mages. We found it most convenient and comfortable to eat dinner at the riad and wander the many areas of Marrakech during the day that way we were back at the riad at night. We never felt in danger as many tourists and locals are out at night but the meals were delicious and we could try many local dishes in the riad. The food was abundant and well prepared. We like the couscous the best compared to other couscous dishes we tried in Marrakech.    Trois Mages location incredibly helpful and attentive manager Azia made our stay relaxing and peaceful provided thoughtful logistic recommendations strong wifi throughout riad comfortable in own room and in the many alcoves quality toiletries and bathrobes for each occupant at a great value. We will stay here again for our next visit to Marrakech.

The location was excellent to get a real feel for the culture and bustling markets of Marrakech. The Riad was clean spacious and very authentic but mostly importantly Aziz (riad manager) and his team (Nazia and Laila) were the perfect hosts and could not do enough for us. The evening meal which we booked in advance was delicious and the daily breakfast provided was plentiful enough so set us up for the day. We requested a last minute BBQ on one of the afternoons and they were more than happy to cater for the 7 of us. As we were the only ones staying in the riad at the time we were able to choose where we wanted to have our meals on the terrace by the pool or in the dining area.  The rooms were all en suite and the maids were attentive to our requests including putting the log fires on when it was a little cold in the evening.

Riad Les Trois Mages,jenitabodhani wrote a review Feb 2016,50,Hen Do,We were a group of 7 girls spending 4 days in Marrakech for a hen weekend. At first we were slightly apprehensive regarding the destination as people say it's unsafe for girls. This is not the case at all. The riad is located in the old town and is managed by a gentlemen called Aziz he and his team could not have been more helpful to us. Our itinerary was planned before we left the UK on arrival to the riad Aziz spent the time to go through each day with us advising where we should go and what to be aware of. The cook Sayeeda made us a lovely breakfast each morning one of the days Sayeeda cooked us a trafional Moroccan meal which was delicious. We also had Sayeeda prepare us lunch BBQ chicken skewers with salad. That too was very tasty.  The taxi company was brilliant this was arranged by Aziz the drivers were very polite English speaking with up to date cars. Club 555 is defo a place to go look on their Facebook page to see what offers they have we went on a Friday night which happened to be ladies night which meant ladies get free entrance and free alcohol all night drinks included were whiskey or vodka. All in all we had a brilliant time and I don't think this would have been achieved if we did not stay where we did and from the hospitality from Aziz and his team.

We were not disappointed.    We received a generous welcome from the start: Aziz greeted us warmly at the door and we were immediately served complimentary mint tea (this is available throughout your stay. We were then given a map recommendations of where to visit eat and drink and made to feel at home. Aziz then left us to our own devices but made himself available throughout the trip and was more than happy to offer advice on the city.    The building itself is an oasis of calm a short walk from the Souqs and the main square beyond. There are six bedrooms on two floors around a central courtyard and three sheltered spaces on the first and second floors with chaises longues and sofas. One room has an electronic baby grand piano (complete with Real Book) and another has a fire (lit on request) a range of guide books and a scrabble set.    There is a also a roof terrace with comfortable seating a sheltered area and a small pool. This is a great spot to have your breakfast (fresh fruit and yoghurt pancakes eggs cooked to order bread rolls croissants freshly-squeezed orange juice mint tea coffee) if you are blessed with warm weather.    Having eaten in various places across the city during our trip we didn’t find better food than the delicious home-cooked fare served at the Riad itself. This needs to be ordered in advance - as well as requests for wine or beer.    This place can’t be recommended highly enough.,Date of stay: February 2016,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PAllies

We booked it on the back of reviews on trip advisor and it certainly lived up to the reviews. Aziz was soooooo helpful even before we arrived in Marrakech arranging transfers from the airport a guided tour of the medina and a private hamman experience for our stay.    Food in the riad is excellent we ate in on our first night and the food was delicious. Breakfast each morning was continental style and plentiful kept us going all morning! We stayed in the Bahia suite as we needed an extra bed and the room was fantastic all toiletries and bathrobes provided and English tea on demand!    The location is great it only takes 5 minutes and you are into the bustle of the medina 10 minutes and you are in the main square. I would recommend booking a guided tour on your first morning to orientate and acclimatise yourself Abdullah our guide was very informative and took us to back streets we would never have found ourselves. We went to heritage spa for our hamman experience which I would also recommendcafe arabe in the evening for cocktails.    It has been a great 3 days away thank you to Aziz and his team for being so helpful and welcoming.

Well located so that it’s only about five minutes walk from where your taxi can drop it’s a haven of peace and quiet. The rooms are tastefully decorated airy and spacious around a lovely central courtyard. We ate in three of our four nights stay simply because the food was of such a high standard and in such a generous quantities. Breakfast too was copious and taken on the pretty terrace. It was lovely to come back from the noise of the souks to take a dip in the pool on the roof.

We can recommend the half day guided tour to get orientated and the full day Berber trail (wear shoes with a decent grip if you're going anywhere near a waterfall).

Riad Les Trois Mages,traveller19862016 wrote a review Jan 2016,50,Excellent Riad - highly recommend,The Riad is in a nice quiet alley in the medina. The roof is very nice with also a very cozy courtyard. We stayed in the Bahia suite and the Arabesque suite. Its certainly worth getting the larger suite as it has a sitting area and a fireplace. Both rooms had great bathrooms.    Aziz - who manages the Riad is extremely helpful and provided us with flexibility and options as well as making sure that our every need was met this is a symptom of the culture at the Riad as the rest of the staff is equally eager to make your stay comfortable.,Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveller19862016

Good location and friendly informative information from Aziz the Riad Manager before we arrived. The riad's decor is soft and inviting. The staff were so friendly an helpful. Food was wonderful especially the evening meal in a romantic setting.    We really enjoyed our stay and are happy to recommend to our friends in the future.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Josh L wrote a review Dec 2015,50,Perfect family occasion,We spent part of our Christmas break with 3 generations of the family - 10 adults and 6 kids from 10 months to 7 years. Aziz and the whole staff were amazing making us feel so welcome comfortable and well-looked after. It was my life partner's birthday while we were there and they kindly provided cake and flowers to make the day special. Everybody at the Trois Mages were so lovely to the kids too. It made for a perfect family stay.,Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Richmond-upon-Thames, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joshl668
Riad Les Trois Mages,Susie W wrote a review Dec 2015,30,5* Customer service but wouldn't go back.,We stayed three nights during November 2015. The Riad is situated down a little back street a little off the beaten track-always a relief to get back to after the hustle and bustle of the main streets it's about 15-20 minute walk (moped dodge) to the square. The staff were very pleasant and super helpful sometimes a little too attentive- when you arrive after a 3 hour car journey it is a tad difficult to focus on a map of the town (and it's quite a complicated town) when you haven't even seen your room. -this said if we hadn't had the tour of The Map we would've been well and truly lost within minutes.    We were disappointed to find that although we arrived at 1o'clock in the afternoon this was already too late to be able to reserve any kind of evening meal so had to go out and fend for ourselves in a strange and difficult city. We booked an evening meal for the following night which was beautifully cooked and delicious slight mix up with puddings ordered but put right at the time and not charged for.    Our room felt quite small but was clean and adequate. The wifi service was excellent.    Unfortunately at some point during our stay in Marrakesh we contracted a very nasty stomach bug -which lingered for 2 weeks after we got home! This has quite likely marred our experience of the hotel as whilst trying to rest in our room in an effort to try to feel better we found the hotel to be a very noisy place to be constant crashing of crockery -like somebody unloading the dishwasher for 8 hours! Not very restful or tranquil. Even on the roof terrace.  I have no experience of any other hotel in Marrakesh -so it is difficult to say how this place rates comparatively however it is fair to say that out of the 3 places we stayed in Morocco it was our least favourite -perhaps Marrakesh deserves the 3 star rating.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Grantham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusieW217

Dear Aziz -you are the star of the place and manager -what can I say besides -thank you for great conversations and intro to the Old City.  Mouhsine lit the best fires in our fireplace in our Bahia suite and taught me how to make a great mint tea.  Both of you daily refused to lower the style.

Riad Les Trois Mages,WiltshireLoynsey wrote a review Dec 2015,50,excellent,I can't find think of anything other than praise for this Riad and it's staff. We stayed for 3 nights in December the welcome was excellent and we felt that nothing was too much trouble for the staff in making our stay as smooth and comfortable as possible.  Location wise the Riad is a short walk from the main square and not too far away from any of the attractions within the Madina.  Our room was spotlessly clean and comfortable the lounge areas are well furnished and tea and coffee is available at all times.  I can't imagine staying at one of the big international hotels in Marrakesh when there is accommodation of this standard with the level of personal service offered for around £80 per night.

My teenage daughters knocked out a few tunes complete with close harmony vocals. They gave up piano lessons at age 7 but what they have learnt from you tube tutorials was amazing. Who knew!

Riad Les Trois Mages,Nuno Macedo wrote a review Nov 2015,50,When service makes a huge difference,When I was choosing a special place for a short 3 days family get-together I was torn between a more modern accommodation in Marrakesh (outside the Medina) and a more authentic place like a Riad. At the end I decided to go for a Riad and have chosen the one that at a first glance would tick most of the boxes i.e. had a lovely terrace with pool would be within easy reach of a main street where a transfer could collect us/drop us off would certainly offer good service and where we'd feel special. Riad Les Trois Mages exceeded all of our expectations and I can certainly see why it has been rated so highly everywhere. Not only is a very good value for money but also delivers a genuine customer focused service with the whole team expressing themselves as part of your family as if the Riad would be your home away from home. From the very first emails where I requested so many things Anna (the owner) Aziz (the manager) were very prompt and delivered in every single aspect to make sure I'd have a very memorable stay. We had a 3 days plan very detailed and precise with places we wanted to visit and things we wanted to do and with the help from their partner tour agent Exotic Lines Travel they indeed made it happen. I'm very grateful for the effort of the whole team (literally every single one of them who in the absence of Aziz on annual leave and Anna in the UK looked after us so well). Kudos to all of them.

Riad Les Trois Mages,jdhr wrote a review Oct 2015,50,"Wonderful stay, beautiful staff and stunning riad",The riad is absolutely beautifully decorated it is a stunning place to stay. It was perfectly located within the medina but close still to a road which has car access meaning you can move around the city easily. If you stay deep within the medina you would spend a lot of time trying to get in and out of it.    The riad itself has beautiful rooms and all decorated thoughtfully. The courtyard is wonderful to sit in and it had two sitting rooms - one of which has a piano and other musical instruments for guests to enjoy. The staff and the riad encourages you to relax and feel welcome and at home and we really did. There is a stunning rooftop as well with a pool and some sun loungers which is perfect to relax in.  We stayed in the Jade Room and this was lovely with a big four poster bed.    The staff were so kind and friendly and really made our stay special. Aziz was so kind and helpful and took a lot of time to explain all about Marrakech and places we might like to go. He organised a great deal of things for us and was always very happy and helpful.

Would also recommend a guided half day tour to get your bearings so you can then wander at leisure with more confidence.  We were able to get wine and beer from a local supermarket just outside the city walls and consume there without issue - not big drinkers but enjoy some wine on holiday in the evening. We enjoyed the peace of the Jardin Majorelle and the well presented Berber museum which are easily walkable from here and made a contrast to the bustle of the medina.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Maturin3 wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Highly recommended,A very peaceful retreat from the hustle and bustle of the medina. We had the 'Bahia' room the largest (I think) which was tastefully decorated in traditional moroccan style.    Staff were very friendly and helpful always willing to go out of their way to assist and guide. Food if ordered was simple but to a high stand. Breakfast was basic but it met the need!    The roof-top terrace was a welcome haven to grab some sun. The pool is small (not really a swimming pool) but is there to cool really. Iron sunbed frames don't really work in the scorching heat but not a major issue.    Overall we had a great stay here and would certainly return when we visit Marrakech again the future.,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Altea, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maturin3
Riad Les Trois Mages,Molly H wrote a review Jul 2015,50,An oasis with excellent staff,The Riad is really lovely situated walking distance from the souks and the square. We stayed for 2 nights in the suite Bahia with a very comfortable bed and lots of space. The manager Aziz could not have been nicer he recommended good places to eat visit and spent time showing us on the map. He booked us drivers who worked with the hotel and were also very helpful and informative. We stayed there with 6 other friends and it felt like a private villa. The pool on the roof is perfect for cooling down and there are sun loungers and shaded areas to relax. Breakfast was great and all the staff were lovely. I'd certainly recommend this Riad for a weekend in Marrakesh with easy access to everything for the short time we were there.,Date of stay: June 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Rugby, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MollyH975
Riad Les Trois Mages,sundberm wrote a review Jun 2015,50,Lovely,As so many of the other reviewers have noted the Riad Les Trois Mages is a lovely place to stay in Marrakech. It is centrally located within the Medina and an easy walk to most of the attractions in the city. After a day of walking around the bustling streets of Marrkech it was amazing how calm quiet cool and relaxing it was within the walls of the Riad. We stayed in the Melchior room and it was lovely. We took three trips organized by the Riad: a half-day guided tour of the Medina the day after we arrived (critical for figuring out how to navigate Marrkech's winding streets) a day long trip to the Ourika Valley and a day long trip to Imlil. All were extremely well organized and very much worthwhile. Riad manager Aziz's service was fantastic from the pre-trip email correspondence (arranging outings and taxi service from the airport) to check out. The food was fantastic. Breakfast was a delight each morning and the couscous we had for one dinner were among the best meals we had in Morocco. Overall we couldn't have been happier with our choice of the Riad and would recommend it to anyone planning a visit to Marrakech.,Date of stay: June 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Houston, Texas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sundberm
Riad Les Trois Mages,anatolykrol wrote a review Jun 2015,50,Delightful,This riad is the perfect place to stay in Marrakech. It is located in the center of Medina walking distance to the main square and the souks. It offers a experience of a typical marroqui house with traditional decoration like from the fairy tale. We stayed in Jade room that was gorgeous. The service and attention by riad manager Aziz was spectacular very personal and helpful. The breakfast was something out from this world - delicious generous and served in such a beautiful way. Mint tea could be served any hour. If you are still deciding between staying in a hotel or a riad definitely go for riad! We absolutely loved it!,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Mexico City, Mexico",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anatolykrol
Riad Les Trois Mages,Emma M wrote a review Jun 2015,40,Wonderful Stay,As the other reviews states this Riad is perfect for a stay in Marrakech the Riad is cool and beautiful decorated and the roof terrace and pool provide wonderful relaxation spot after the madness of Marrakech. The Riad arranged our transfers to and from the airport our half day walking tour and our hot air balloon ride; all of which were stress free and high quality. It is a three minute walk from the edge of the souk (which leads to the main square) and there is a handy second option for the walk if you want to avoid the souk after too much bargaining! Aziz 2 gave us a wonderful overview of the city upon arrival and some helpful tips to ensure we didn't pay too much for anything and avoid any sticky situations. Breakfast was lovely and served whenever suits the guest. The only slight negative for us was our evening meal whilst it was nice we didn't experience it as high quality as others have mentioned but it could be personal preferences. Finally our room was the Melchior; which is beautiful & recommend but it is on the ground floor beside the kitchen. Staff definitely try to keep noise to a bare minimum but if you did want a lie-in an upstairs room may be better...Overall I would highly recommend it!!!,Date of stay: June 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmmaM214

Her Chicken tagine and couscous is probably the best I have ever had.  Room was very well designed with a a very ethic Moroccan feel.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Mark I wrote a review May 2015,50,A wonderful and stylish Riad,We stayed here for three nights when we arrived in Marrakech then returned for two nights just before we flew home. Aziz and his staff were very welcoming and took time to go through a map of the medina and places we might like to visit. They also have an excellent driver Mohammed who took us on a day trip to the Atlas Mountains. He was very accommodating and gave us a fantastic insight into life in the mountains. The Riad itself is beautiful with a lovely roof-top terrace where you can shade yourself if it is very hot they also have a little pool. We will definitely be returning to this Riad.,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marki434
Riad Les Trois Mages,Marissa E wrote a review May 2015,50,A true oasis in Marrakesh,We had a wonderful 3 day stay at Le Trois Mages and I would highly recommend it. It's located in the heart of Marrakesh but once you enter the riad you step into a haven of calm! The staff were all super helpful and friendly the rooms are lovely and the food is great. Make sure you have dinner there at least once..it's so worth it! The roof terrace with splash pool is an added bonus after a hot day in the souks. A big thank you to Aziz (number 1 and 2) and the team for making our stay there one of the real highlights of our Moroccan adventure.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Anne A wrote a review May 2015,50,Best place EVER!!!,If I could give ten stars I would. I wanted to pick the best Riad in Marrakesh that was still reasonably priced and Les Trois Mages fit the bill. From the moment I booked our stay Aziz was on it--he contacted me by email right away with detailed information about our upcoming visit. We booked our airport transfer through the riad and even our lunch on arrival. Even when our flight had to be changed and I had to adjust our pick up time from the airport he was quick to respond and understanding of our situation. No hassles whatsoever.    When we got to the riad it was like stepping into an oasis a paradise among the hustle and bustle of the city right around the corner. It was so quiet and peaceful and the decor was pristine. We felt like Moroccan princesses. Aziz gave us time to relax in the courtyard and was not overbearing at all. Then he offered us tea and cookies and sat down with us to map out the city. We never felt rushed or unimportant. We might has well been the only guests staying there because of all the attention and kindness we were given. He booked our hamam/massage for us. We really didn't have to worry about anything.    We were especially delighted with the lunch that was prepared--in my emails I requested that we have something traditional and what we got was the most glorious tasty saucy juicy tanjin chicken known to man. If you want a taste of traditional Moroccan cookery you will not regret ordering in with the restaurant. This isn't a big chain hotel that's going to prepare your meal in a big vat for others to share. Even our breakfasts were prepared with love and detail and we enjoyed the spread that was before us every morning. I didn't get the ladies' names but they were so awesome and sweet. I could tell they work hard but they never look tired or moody and they always greeted us with a friendly smile.    Our room was equally wonderful; dressed in beautiful deep reds browns and oranges and our bathroom fixtures adorned with gold. Complimentary water was important as it was hot when we visited as was the air conditioning unit the cooled the room down quickly. When we came back to the riad late at night after observing and enjoying the excitement in the main square the night guy was quick to open the door and very welcoming.    Need I say more? The best thing you can do for yourself is book this riad. I did not regret it and I'm pretty proud of myself for picking the right place. Pat on the back for me. Our stay here was one of the best if not THE BEST part of our trip. :) thank you! Thank you!,Date of stay: May 2015,,"Fremont, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnneA943

This riad made our holiday!!! We were welcomed by Aziz who made us feel so welcome straight away with tea pancakes. He went through the map of the area and the medina with us would have been lost without it. He even left us a bottle wine as I was celebrating a birthday.  Location is great it was close to centre so was easy to get up in the morning and see the sights and then chill by the pool for an hour or so in the afternoon or enjoy a game of checkers.  Would definitely stay here again. Thanks Aziz and the rest of the team in Les Trois Mages.

Aziz and his team cannot do enough for you they are always on hand to provide advice as to where to go eat and to give you instructions as to how to get places which are easy to follow.    One thing we did find is that they do tend to recommend some of the more westernised places to eat but they were all very nice!

Riad Les Trois Mages,Alan B wrote a review Apr 2015,50,"Fantastic Riad, Perfect Location",We arrived with friends (a party of 4) for a 4 day break in April. From our initial booking to our last day we had fantastic service from Azis and his colleagues. This was summed up on our last day - We had a late flight and had spent the day haggling in the Souks for some last minute shopping and got back to the Riad exhausted and hungry. Azis arranged for us to have homemade bread cheese and olives before we left for our flight. What a great gesture and fully appreciated.  Tips - would highly recommend the 1/2 day guided tour on your first morning; we were taking to places by Abdul that we would never have visited and was very educational. The 1 day trip to the Ourika Valley in the Atlas Mountains with Mohammed was a highlight for it's beauty and the Market.  Overall we had a fantastic time and would very strongly recommend this Riad.

Riad Les Trois Mages,em_3186 wrote a review Apr 2015,50,An oasis in Marrakech...,I took my husband here for his 30th birthday. From the very first communication with Aziz I was fully confident that I had chosen our accommodation well. My e-mails were responded to promptly with all the information I had requested - and more helpful information I had not yet considered.    Upon arrival we were picked up by our driver (who Aziz had arranged for us) who was very friendly & escorted us right to the front door (he even carried all of our luggage for us). We were greeted by Aziz (Manager) who immediately offered us mint tea (my husband is now addicted!) & some lovely pastries. He then gave us a helpful map & talked us through various landmarks to look out for to assist our navigation back to the riad. This proved to become very helpful as it was our first visit to beautiful Marrakech.    We had a meal at the riad on the evening we arrived which was absolutely delicious & would thoroughly recommend sampling the wonderful dishes they offer.    More about the food - the breakfasts are amazing! They consist of fruit yoghurt pancakes breads pastries eggs - all completely fresh! And you can chose to have it in the courtyard the music room the lounge or in the sun on the amazing roof terrace. This set us up well for the days of exploring!    Every time we walked through the front door it was instantly calm & relaxing - a world away from the bustle of the streets! The riad itself it beautifully decorated & spotless throughout. It is located approximately 10-15 minutes walk from Jemaa el Fna Square (if you know the way & don't get distracted en route by the wonderful wares on display in the souks!)    Throughout our stay were were always greeted by smiling friendly faces - Aziz Saida Mouhsine Najia & Laila.    We stayed in the Bahia Suite. Wow! What can I say? Pure luxury... If you can book it I would recommend it! Our fire was even lit for us on our last night as the weather had cooled considerably that evening.    We cannot thank you all enough for helping make our stay so special & can't wait to return to Riad Les Trois Mages!,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/em_3186
Riad Les Trois Mages,Gembem wrote a review Apr 2015,50,"Classy, elegant riad",We stayed our last night here and I so wish we had stayed a different night as we literally didn't want to leave! It's so luxurious and we picked here as it was my birthday. As we were sunbathing and swimming in the rooftop pool a lovely bottle of wine was left in our room with a birthday card from the staff at the riad which was such a nice touch I actually thought my boyfriend had arranged it but then realised he's definitely not that romantic!  As we were leaving early for our flight home breakfast was arranged for us early.  Would highly recommend this riad if you're looking for somewhere luxurious understatedly stylish and comfortable. It's much pricier than what you'd expect to pay in marrakech but it's great for a treat.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gembem

It was recommended to us by a work colleague and exceeded all our expectations.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Alexandra M wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Fantastic honeymoon at Les Trois Mages,My husband and I came to Marrakech for our honeymoon and picked les trois mages based on the wonderful tripadvisor reviews it had received. We were not disappointed. The property is beautiful with a lovely rooftop with a pool a gorgeous courtyard and multiple sitting rooms where you can enjoy a meal or cup of mint tea. The managers Aziz during the day and Mohammed at night were kind and extremely hospitable. They were happy to arrange anything your heart desired from tours to dinner reservations. We stayed in the beautiful and romantic Bahia suite and Mohammed built us a fire in the fireplace which was great. The in-house cooks were lovely and the food was great including the tasty (included) breakfasts. It is well-located and a quick walk to anywhere you'd want to go (or an even quicker super-cheap cab ride if its raining or you are in uncomfortable shoes). We had 4 star accomodations and service but for a fraction of the price of the hotel chains (why would you ever stay at one when you could get individualized service at a riad?!). I would suggest Les Trois Mages to all. You absolutely will not be disappointed.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Chicago, Illinois",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexandramI383HU

Riad Les Trois Mages,Shytorq wrote a review Mar 2015,50,"Fantastic hospitality, great value.",This lovely riad really has the personal touch.  Aziz the manager welcomes you with mint tea pastries and takes time to sit with you and give a comprehensive guide to Marrakech.  He arranged our airport pick up and also kindly purchased bus tickets to Essaouira on our behalf with no surcharge.  The rooms are characterfuly decorated all with ensuite bathrooms and the benefit of electric blankets for the chilly nights. The roof terrace was great with the heated pool and loungers.  We took dinner in the riad the food lovely and equal to that served at the exclusive Maison Arabe at a fraction of the cost.The breakfasts were also lovely with warm fresh bread fruit yoghurt pancakes and eggs. Complimentary tea coffee and water were offered day and night.  To sum up i can't remember the last time i stayed in a property with such friendly high standards of service at such a reasonable price. As an exampletwo days after our stay and returning from Essaouira we had a six hour wait for our flight and were lugging suitcases around town. Cheekily i knocked on the door of the riad and asked if we could leave the cases there for the afternoon. Aziz welcomed us in offered refreshments and use of the riad to relax while we waited and also booked our transport to the airport.

The rooftop terrace is a particularly nice spot to relax. Breakfast was perfect and I would recommend having an evening meal in the Riad which we really enjoyed.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Bob M wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Excellent,Thank you Aziz for making our 3 night stay fantastic. The Riad itself is beautiful and tranquil we loved the roof top terrace a fantastic place to sit in the evening with a glass of wine. Before we arrived Aziz had already emailed us to arrange for our arrival. We were made to feel at home the whole time and would reccommend this superb Riad to everyone. The Night Porter could not be more helpful even lighting the fire for us in the evening.  Top Tip - the Riad sells wine but alcohol is very difficult to find and expensive within the Medina so it is worthwhile bringing a bottle of your favourite tipple from duty free if you like something stronger.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Lousa, Portugal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jandb162
Riad Les Trois Mages,soundasaeuro wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Different Class - The Personal Touch,What a great place to stay. From the minute we arrived we were treated with 5 star hospitality. The night porter is a really friendly guy and having arrived late he was able to offer us some tips for where to eat and when we chose he rang ahead and booked a table for us. He even went to the bother of walking us towards the cafe so that we didn't get lost.    The girls worked really hard for us throughout our stay and were extremely accommodating for any of our requests. Aziz the manager is a lovely guy and provides an invaluable map with lots of tips and routes marked in it. I can't stress how important a good map is in Marrakech 😃 He provided us with lots of tips to help us enjoy our stay in Marrakech.    And if you enjoy a drink like we do they guys are able to organise some drinks to be brought to the Riad for you or can guide you to the nearest super market where you can get some booze! They are quite relaxed and happy for you to enjoy a drink or 2 on the terrace unlike some other Riad's.    Overall beautiful building great hosts excellent accommodation great location and probably one of the best Riad's in Marrakech.

Riad Les Trois Mages,fm3583 wrote a review Mar 2015,50,"Beautiful place to stay, faultless service",My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights in March in the Arabesque room. The riad is beautifully decorated in traditional Moroccan style with a lovely courtyard and roof terrace with a small pool which is perfect for relaxing after a morning wandering around the souks. The staff are wonderful really trustworthy and nothing is too much trouble. All tea/coffee/water is free and the staff will bring you a drink up to the terrace whenever you like. We ate a meal here the first night and this was lovely too. Breakfast was also lovely - fruit yoghurt juice coffee pancakes and eggs.The riad also organised to get us some wine which was really helpful it meant we could have a drink in the evening when we got back to the riad. Aziz and Mahmout (riad manager and night porter) are very helpful and polite - made us reservations for restaurants organised airport taxis told us where to visit in the city and explained the best routes to walk on the map (location of the riad is 5 mins walk from the souk). The mint tea is amazing! I am so glad we chose to stay at this riad it really made our trip to Marrakesh perfect can't recommend it enough and for the price you pay it is excellent value for money. Thank you to all the staff at the riad for such a lovely stay.

Riad Les Trois Mages,LynnUKhertsfordshire wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Beautiful Riad in excellent location,We spent four nights here in February 2015. The Riad is beautiful & very well maintained. We loved the peace & tranquility of the Riad. The Riad is perfectly positioned for exploring the Medina sights & souks. Everywhere was in very easy walking distance & we didn't need any form of transport during our stay. We visited as a group of 5 & had 2 rooms the Bahia Suite & Melchior room. both rooms were beautiful immaculately clean with lovely soft cotton sheets on the beds. A lovely touch was finding the electric blankets on on the bed - very welcome on a chilly night!!. There is a lovely tranquil roof terrace with heated pool. As it was pretty chilly at the time we were there we didn't spend too much time on the terrace - but it is the perfect place to relax in warmer months.  The staff at the Riad were all very helpful & friendly. In particular I have to mention Aziz the Manager. He really went out of his way to make our stay at the Riad so perfect. He was always on hand to answer any questions he booked restaurants for us (& arranged for a guide to take us to & from the restaurants as we would have got lost!!) & arranged our taxi to & from the airport - all of which ran smoothly with no problems. We were very impressed by the way he greeted us with mint tea & spent time explaining everything and provided us with an excellent map & instructions on how to get to the various places we wanted to visit. He always made sure that we had delicious mint tea whenever we were in the Riad. He is a real asset to Riad Les Trois Mages! In fact - with Aziz there to guide & advise us our guidebook was rarely used!  Aziz arranged for us to have a guide around the medina on our first day in Marrakech (book this in advance if you can). I would really recommend booking the half day guided tour if it is your first visit to Marrakech. Mohammed was outstanding - he took us to various sights which we wouldn't have found without him & he also took us into the Souks & explained about how to haggle & where to buy certain items. We were particularly fascinated by to see & meet some of the craftsmen working in the Souks & I doubt if we would have found some of them without Mohammed's guidance. Mohammed explained many things about the culture sights etc & was great at answering our many questions. A tour with Mohammed is a definite must!  We arranged to eat at the Riad on the first night & enjoyed a beautiful tasty meal - a great start to our holiday. 2 of us did the cookery class with Saida which we thoroughly enjoyed. We enjoyed going to the markets with her before our class to buy the ingredients. As our French was limited Aziz helped us by translating for us during our class which was a great help.  Breakfast at the Riad was delicious - fresh fruit yogurt local pastries etc. The perfect start to the day. There is good free Wifi throughout the Riad.  There is nothing I could fault about Riad Les Trois Mages & will definitely be back to stay there again.,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"hertsfordshire, UK",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LynnUKhertsfordshire

The room was beautiful and the riad is in a great location just 10-15 mins walk from the medina but the riad itself is a quiet and peaceful oasis from the bustling streets outside. The staff were helpful and gave us clear directions to the medina and souks and suggested some excellent places for dinner each night.

Riad Les Trois Mages,andyglasgow14 wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Incredible,If you are thinking about booking a riad in Marrakech you have to book Les Trois Mages. We have stayed in top hotels around the world but the standard of accommodation facilities and particularly the staff made this one of our most memorable experiences anywhere. From the moment we booked Aziz looked after our every need. He was always present checking everything was in order and if he could do anything to help us. His recommendations for routes restaurants and general things to do were fantastic. Nothing was too much trouble. Mouhsine is a gem. What a great man. He was so welcoming when we came back from our nights out always welcoming us with a smile offering to light us a fire and make us a drink. He even walked us to our taxi one morning when I'm sure he should have been finished working. Saida's cooking was amazing and her constant desire to please us by serving us food and drink wherever we wanted it was very much appreciated. The room itself was beautiful and very very clean. This is an authentic Moroccan house where we truly felt like family. Why did we ever stay in a characterless hotel when we came to this city before! If you are going to Marrkech book Les Trois Mages and let Aziz take care of all your other arrangements for you. That's what I'd do next time. Even the taxi's he booked for us were a high class of vehicle with polite drivers unlike the petite taxis in town. Oh how we wish we were back there right now.

Riad Les Trois Mages,LM82 wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Outstanding service,We spent 3 nights at this Riad which we picked after reading the rave reviews on this site. The Riad lived up to expectations - mainly due to the fantastic customer service as nothing was too much trouble for the staff. We were met by Aziz and given tea and pastries while we checked in. He also spent time showing us the main sites on the map and giving us directions to the main square complete with landmarks to look for - extremely helpful as it is very easy to get lost in Marrakech! Aziz also arranged a private day trip to the Ourika Valley and Atlas Mountains for us which was a little more expensive than the group trips but definitely worth the extra cost as we had a private driver.    We were in the Arabesque room which was perfectly sized for 2. Noise does carry from the other rooms and the courtyard but if you are a light sleeper like me you will probably be travelling with earplugs anyway! The room is equipped with AC which we didn't need given the time of year and also an electric blanket for the cooler winter evenings. The bathroom is large and clean with traditional decoration and comes with both towels and bathrobes plus complimentary toiletries.    There are only 6 rooms in the Riad so it never felt busy or crowded. We spent some time sunbathing on the roof terrace which also has a small pool. All areas were clean and well kept. Breakfast was included as part of the price and was excellent - fresh fruit and yoghurt pastries bread and eggs - plenty to keep you going for the day.    The Riad is well located only a 15min walk from the main square and the souks. If you are looking for accommodation in the Medina then I can't imagine anywhere being any better value for money or providing better service.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LM82
Riad Les Trois Mages,John H wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Les Trois Mages Marrakech,Just returned from a 4 day trip to Marrakech. A great place to visit especially at this time of the year. The Medina area was fascinating and the weather good enough to sit outside and relax. What made the holiday special was the Les Trois Mages Riad a really beautiful place to stay right in the heart of the Medina. The Riad only had 4 or 5 rooms so you were never crowded and received great personal service. Aziz and his team organised 2 super trips (a guided 1/2 day walking tour of the Medina and a day trip to the Atlas Mountains) - both to be recommended. The drivers guides and all the Riad staff really looked after us make sure that you have at least 1 meal in the Riad good quality and very reasonably priced.,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Barnet, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnhS1274EE
Riad Les Trois Mages,BrandyB wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Love Love Love,Spent the last couple of nights of our 11 day Morocco trip at this beautiful riad. It's beautiful peaceful and an absolute oasis in the delicious madness of the medina. A wonderful way to wind down and relax after a 4 day desert excursion. I was in the Balthazar room and it was clean beautifully decorated and the bathroom a good size and very nice. The staff was welcoming professional and helpful. The location is great for both inside and outside the medina. There is a wonderful spa a short walk away that is a must (the one past the taxi stand). The courtyard is nice and the rooftop stunning. I recommend going up in the morning with a book and coffee as well as sunset with a cocktail. This is not a party house but we did stay up late having cocktails (we purchased offsite and brought in as not to drink everything they had!) and playing cards (they have a nice library of movies books and games).

Riad Les Trois Mages,LizLumsden wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Beautiful riad; excellent staff. We'll be back!,This was our first trip outside of Europe and was by far the most welcoming beautiful place we have ever stayed. We were in the Bahia suite which is just stunning. The log fire was welcome in February too but breakfast on the terrace was worth a little chill - the sun warms the place and little birds joined us for breakfast every morning which never failed to make me smile.    The food was absolutely delicious; whether it was the interesting variations at breakfast every morning home-made cake with tea after a long day out or a fabulous dinner. We were extremely well looked after by all of the staff. Aziz and Mohammad could not have been kinder or more attentive hosts and Sadia's cooking was amazing - we thoroughly recommend her cooking class.    We would also thoroughly recommend a guided tour of the Medina; a lovely man named Mohammad took us around and gave us a fascinating view into life in Marrakech. We were also taken on a number of day trips by a lovely man also named Mohammad who was really helpful knowledgeable and just generally good company. We had a wonderful time every day and almost all of our activities came either directly through or recommended through Aziz at the riad.    I cannot think of a better way to explain our experience at this riad other than that it felt like a proper home away from home. We felt welcome and comfortable every moment of our stay there. The decor is also sumptuous and we cannot recommend this place enough.    We absolutely hope to return one day.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Melissa K wrote a review Feb 2015,50,Stay here!,The above reviews are all true! Our recent Feb 2015 stay at Les Trois Mages was FAB. My friend and I arrived at the Riad to the welcoming sight of tea pastries and a gorgeous lunch on the roof. We walked around with mouths agape as we toured inside: indoor open courtyard several lovely lounge areas (one with fireplace!) ornate tilework everywhere and great rooftop (with pool) for hanging out and eating meals.The entire place is extremely clean tidy and the staff is fantastic. Nothing is too much for them to arrange. The head of the Riad Aziz was amazing; from his prompt email responses prior to our arrival to helping us organize our few days in Marrakech to giving us city maps and going over detailed directions.. He was super friendly and made us feel so welcome throughout our stay. Mouhsine the night guard always greeted us warmly when we came through the door at night by making us tea and pastries. The kitchen staff served us nothing short of glorious feasts either in the open courtyard or on the rooftop (one morning was chilly; they brought us blankets!) Housekeeping was superb; always providing a large bottle of spring water for the room and fresh robes in the bathroom. Speaking of bathroom: ours had gorgeous tilework hammered copper sink and faucets and stone shower (a work of art in itself). Les Trois Mages is conveniently located inside the [um mildly] chaotic medina but once you walk inside the Riad it becomes a serene retreat. Oh and the beds have electric heating pads under the sheets (a GLORIOUS invention for those chilly Moroccan winter nights). Never knew how amazing it could be to sleep in a heated bed. Aziz emailed us after we left Morocco to make sure we made it to the airport and if we got home ok. He could not have been more gracious.

Riad Les Trois Mages,LKRocky86 wrote a review Feb 2015,50,Highlight of our stay in Marrakech,We stayed here for 3 nights in January and it was the highlight of our trip. I booked the Bahia Suite as it was my boyfriends Birthday and I am so glad I did - it was such a beautiful riad and the friendliness of the staff was second to none.    We had a flight delay but the very professional Aziz was prompt in reconfirming our driver would still pick us up at the later time and escort us to the Riad. We met the lovely night guardian Mouhsin who really took care of us our whole stay - from tea and biscuits as soon as we checked in to delicious coffee and breakfast very early in the morning on the day we left. Even when we wanted to have our dinner on the roof terrace on our first night Mouhsin kindly obliged and set up a lovely table for us and when we realised how cold it was would help bring our food to our room. Every night when we returned to our room and were feeling chilly Mouhsin would kindly light the fire for us. On our first day when we were ready to venture out Mouhsin popped out of nowhere and walked us to the main taxi point - what a gentleman!    Nothing was a problem for the team - the lovely ladies would make us eggs and crepes for breakfast every morning - where we sat in the beautiful patio and Aziz would help us plan our day with the map which he had already marked with all the main landmarks.    We loved coming home to our Bahia Suite every night the hamman style bathtub was beautiful the bathrobes were clean and soft the electric blankets a pleasure on the chilly January nights! I would recommend eating at the riad - my favourite meal was the grilled sardines and lamb tagine.    Aziz the manager was very kind and helpful - he printed out our boarding passes ready for our flight home and arranged our taxi back to the airport. On our last evening he left a bottle of wine and birthday card in the room for my boyfriend.    I would definately recommend anyone visiting Marrakech to stay at this lovely riad - the pool on the terrace is perfect for a quick dip the food decor and service is wonderful and you are right in the old Medina.,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LKRocky86
Riad Les Trois Mages,James B wrote a review Jan 2015,50,Highly Recommended,We spent a week at Les Trois Mages and thoroughly enjoyed it ! We can only echo other comments that the Riad is well placedcomfortable and friendly.

Riad Les Trois Mages,uforsyth wrote a review Jan 2015,50,Lovely stay in Riad Les Trois Mages,We have just returned home after a week in the Riad and I would like to thank the satff Aziz Saida Mouhsine Najia & Laila for making our stay really nice. They were so warm and friendly and couldn't do enough for us..  I had a birthday while we were there and they gave me a beautiful display of flowers and a lovely card. It will be a birthday I will not forget!    On our arrival Aziz gave us a map and spent time with us going over it and pointing out places of interest and good places to eat. The breakfast each morning was good and it set you up for the rest of the day. We pre-ordered dinner a couple of nights and it was lovely.  It was a good location for walking to most sights (includingJem El Fna Souks Jardin Majorelle). About 20-30 minute walk to Koutubia mosque and the Bahia and El Badi Palaces.  Would I go back?

Riad Les Trois Mages,FS282014 wrote a review Jan 2015,50,Perfect,Just got back from a 4 night stay at the riad. Very well run riad with brilliant staff.    Great location being 10-20 minute walk to most sights (includingJem El Fna Souks Jardin Majorelle). About 20-30 minute walk to Koutubia mosque and the Bahia and El Badi Palaces.    Very peaceful ambience in the riad and well decorated. Nice rooftop terrace which would be a great place to relax when the weather is slightly warmer.    We stayed in the Bahia suite which was very spacious and had its own fireplace large bathtub/shower and electric blankets with heating/AC which was great with the cooler weather in January.    The staff couldn't have been any better. Very approachable and helpful. Provided hot drinks whenever required. Particularly the manager Aziz who was always there to help and make sure we were happy. Organised our airport transfers and excursion to the Atlas mountains with no fuss at all. Also sat down with us on arrival to help orientate us and gave us a map with recommended restaurants and sights with the best routes from the riad marked on.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Brenna F wrote a review Jan 2015,50,Riad Les Trois Mages,Our family had a wonderful time at this Riad! It was lovely safe and the care was very personal. One of the highlights of our stay was the cooking class Aziz arranged for my daughters and I to take with the Riad's brilliant chef Saida. We accompanied Saida to the outdoor market used by locals and watched how carefully she selected and bargained for every ingredient. Saida really took my daughters under her tutelage and shared her secrets for spicing meats and vegetables. What a delightful way to spend the morning. The best part was it culminated in a fabulous lunch on the rooftop terrace -- the best meal we enjoyed during our 2 week trip to Morocco! On a different day we found ourselves wandering (in the wrong direction) and an employee of the Riad happened to see us and came over to volunteer her help.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Joannchen11 wrote a review Jan 2015,50,"Wonderful Service, Beautiful Space, Ideal Location",A friend and I stayed at Les Trois Mages for two nights and we were thrilled with our experience because of the incredible service provided by the staff the beautiful room and spaces in the riad and the convenient central location.    SERVICE  We booked the room through Expedia and we were pleasantly surprised when the manager Aziz reached out by email to tell us more about the riad and to see if we wanted the hotel's help in arranging transportation from the train station. He offered useful and prompt advice on booking train tickets and he stayed in touch with us before we arrived. On the day we arrived Aziz gave us the most thorough and helpful explanation of the city giving us clear instructions on the riad's location relative to the key attractions so that we could easily find our way in a city where it's very easy to get lost. The service continued to be excellent with what we considered lavish breakfasts and always 100% friendly interactions with all the staff.    SPACE  The riad itself is beautiful and it felt like an oasis in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Marrakech. The rooms were lovely and comfortable but it was the common spaces that really won us over. The middle of the riad is open air and it opened on to a beautifully furnished music room with a piano and guitars and a wonderful entertainment room with a fireplace tons of books and games and a music system. We were honestly knocked out by how beautiful the riad was.    LOCATION  Les Trois Mages has an absolutely perfect location. It's located in the medina which means that you're only a 30-minute walk at most from basically anything you want to see in the city from the palaces to the new city where there are restaurants galleries and shops. The souks (basically a bazaar of vendors selling Moroccan slippers clothing woodwork metalwork spices and much more) are only a 10- to 15-minute walk away and the famous Jamaa el Fna square is about 20 minutes away. The best part of Les Trois Mages' location is that it is still relatively easy to find just two short turns off a main street. The alleys of Marrakech are definitely a labyrinth but Les Trois Mages was always easy for us to find our way back to which was especially nice because we were two money traveling together and often coming back to the riad after dark.    All to say staying at Les Trois Mages was the best decision of our time in Marrakech and we highly recommend it!,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Boston, Massachusetts",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joannchen11

Aziz provided an exquisite chocolate cake and the other staff provided a 'birthday table' for us on the roof terrace complete with balloons rose petals. flowers and 'happy birthday' music.

Riad Les Trois Mages,C0rnishPiskie wrote a review Jan 2015,50,Truly a haven away from the rush of the city,We stayed at Riad Les Trois Mages for a week - there is no denying that this is one of the most beautiful places I have ever had the fortune to call home for a while!    On arrival we were met by the night guard who found us and our taxi (our driver couldn't find the riad!) and led us into the coolness and welcoming arms of our new home. Our induction was short and we were soon in our room before we headed out to find some food (pretty brave of us really it was dark out!) following some great directions.    So many reviewers have said it but it cannot be overstated enough - Riad Les Trois Mages is an oasis of calm in what can be a fairly intimidating city. This was my first time in Marrakech and will in all honestly likely be my last however I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this as the very best place to stay if you want to be in the 'old' quarter.    The lovely ladies who work in the riad couldn't be more attentive; nothing is too much trouble and they're always available if you need something. I would certainly recommend dining one evening; the tagine is beautiful. It was my birthday while we were staying and Aziz organised a lovely cake for me allowed us to eat on the rooftop and even decorated the area with balloons and streamers! A perfect evening.    Our only downsides would be the visitation of a couple of cockroaches to our room - I'd never seen one before in my life and don't ever wish to again! I suppose one should expect this kind of thing in Morocco really; they did put down some sort of deterrent and we only saw one more after that. Still not a nice surprise though! Additionally if you have a room on the ground floor you can be woken by early breakfasters....but I'm an early riser so this didn't bother me. Staying in August we wanted to be out and about early so we could get back before it got too hot outside to be in the souks!    If you're going to Marrakesh I promise you this is the place to stay.,Date of stay: August 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Stalybridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C0rnishPiskie

Especially the excellent service cannot be complimented enough. Hotel Manager Aziz and his friendly team do a fist-class job. I can't remember the last time I felt that welcome in a hotel.  The Riad's location is perfect to explore the wonderful city and a good starting point for several trips.    All in all a nearly perfect stay.

The hospitality and warmth of Aziz and his team was second to none - there was always helpful tips & advice on hand for our stay and lots of delicious mint tea!    The attention to detail in the riad is also very impressive - the decor is beautiful and seemingly little things like a mobile phone for us to use to make local calls and adaptors in the rooms meant we were left wanting nothing.    Sun loungers and small pool on the rooftop made it the perfect oasis after a day in the souks as well.

The breakfast was yummy and the very special dinner Azuz arranged to bring in for our New Years Eve was just wonderful. We sat in the side room with a beautifully set table and a roaring fire to keep us warm. The beds were comfortable and the towels soft. There is a baby grand piano that plays beautiful music.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Madkath wrote a review Dec 2014,50,A home from home,We were made to feel at home from the moment we arrived at this fantastic Riad. It's a bit disconcerting when you arrive in Marrakech in the dark and are taken down a narrow alleyway to the unassuming front door but once that door is opened and you are welcomed with mint tea it is not long before you relax into the beautiful surrounds of the Riad.  We stayed 4 nights in total 2 nights at the start of our holiday in the Bahia suite and then we returned after 3 nights on a Desert trip to the Melchior room for another 2 nights. Both rooms were fabulous spotlessly clean and with everything you could need for a short stay the electric blankets were much appreciated as the evenings can be very chilly in December!  What makes this Riad truly exceptional is the staff Aziz Mouhsine Saida and Najia make a fantastic team nothing was too much trouble for them. The welcome we received from Mouhsine on our first night made us feel like we were visiting old friends and the meal Saida cooked was delicious - as good if not better than any other meal we had during the week.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Sherry M wrote a review Dec 2014,50,Amazing!,But not where google maps says it is! The owner told us he had tried to contact google about it many times. It is actually in the medina of marrakech. This riad is as it is advertised with the rooms being very clean & nicely decorated. The pool & lounge area on the roof top terrace are great! The owner is a very nice man who will give you a map & explain were everything is in Marrakech. He even has a cell phone in each room with his number preprogrammed in it that you take with you in case you need anything! Or get lost. Lol. The only problem is in finding the front door it is down a tiny alleyway with no sign for it except a small plaque on the front door. I recommend contacting the owner before you arrive and he will come out and greet you! I wish we had spent more time here! As we were the only guests that night in the riad he gave us a free upgrade to the suite!

Aziz even went out of his way to buy Supratour bus tickets for me as you cant buy them outside of Morocco. This is outstanding service.

Riad Les Trois Mages,BristolLovetotravel wrote a review Nov 2014,50,Beautiful Riad in an excellent location,My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights in September. We chose this Riad after reading the positive reviews and it didn't disappoint.    From the moment we arrived we were made to feel so at home and were welcomed with fresh cakes mint tea& juice. We were provided with a map that had been highlighted with various landmarks and routes so that when we ventured out onto the manic streets of Marrakech we wouldn't get lost!    Our room was lovely beautifully decorated and very traditional. Air con was quiet too!    The breakfasts each morning set us up for the day. We could choose whether to eat in the courtyard or up on the roof terrace and it was always served with a smile.    On our first night we pre ordered a meal as we were arriving quite late at night and didn't want the hassle of venturing out for food. That meal was beautiful can definitely recommend the lemon chicken tagine!    The pool area was a welcome relief from the heat. Although not big it was lovely to be able to sit and read while dipping toes to keep cool. There were also plenty of shaded areas on the terrace if you prefer that to the sun.    This Riad is simply beautiful and in a brilliant location. What makes it extra special though are the attentive and friendly staff who go out of their way to help with any queries/questions about the local area or excursions etc. Also the little touches like the complimentary bottled water and tea& coffee all help set this Riad above and beyond the rest.

In my case Aziz the manager went to help me negotiate the purchase and design of some Moroccan furniture from a master craftsman who spoke only Arabic. Then he made sure the items were completed as promised as well as arranged for the transport after I had long left the hotel.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Fellulah wrote a review Oct 2014,50,Top Choice,From the first moment we contacted the Riad to book our stay until we left every member of staff was helpful warm and engaging. We booked a driver to collect us from the airport he was on time and easy to spot we even got a mini tour from him as we drove along he pointed out places of interest for us new to the currency we got in a bit of a dither about the tip but he refused it (maybe because we were trying to give him the equivalent of £20?? LOL). We had also booked dinner for the first night...it was huge! And really tasty.  We had the Arabesque suite again beautifully decorated clean and comfortable. There was always a fresh bottle of water put in our room each day too.  As others have said Aziz is the star of the show...when we arrived it was the evening before 'The Feast of the Lamb' the Muslim equivalent to our Christmas he explained all about the holiday gave advise on where to go eat and drink as many places are closed at this time and generally went out of his way to be accommodating in every way. He also arranged for a small fee to get someone to pick up our train tickets to Fes for us so we would have more time to enjoy the city.  Breakfast was lovely especially the fruit cocktails with yoghurt. We would also like to thank the night guardian who was always quick to ensure we had coffee or tea when we got back from our evening of wandering.  All in all there was nothing to find fault with in this lovely riad and we would recommend a stay here to anyone.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fellulah

Riad Les Trois Mages,emma_canada_uk wrote a review Oct 2014,50,Incredible Service - hope to visit again soon,My boyfriend and I stayed here for five nights at the end of September and I cannot recommend it enough. We found the riad through Trip Advisor - it 100% lives up to its great reviews.  We booked our taxi from the airport through the riad and were greeted by a super friendly English-speaking driver who drove us in a comfortable KIA Sorrento to our riad.  Upon arrival Aziz (#2 as he called himself as Aziz #1 was on vacation) sat us down in the courtyard where we were served mint tea and pastries while he talked us through a highlighted map and asked us what we wanted out of our trip. We ended up also booking an Imlil mountain tour through the riad and a half-day camel trip -- both highly recommended.    The first night we were given the suggestion of eating at Cafe Arabe (also a great spot!) and were walked out to the main car park and given directions by the night manager Mouhsin. I was thoroughly impressed that he went to the effort to walk us out of the riad and make sure we didn't get lost.    The staff were incredibly attentive always asking us if we wanted more tea water travel suggestions etc.and always offered us the option of eating in the courtyard or upstairs on the gorgeous rooftop terrace. They knew my boyfriend and I both by name and always asked us how our day went with genuine interest.    The riad is situated in Old Town (the area of Marrakech surrounded by the city walls). My boyfriend and I found it very easy (and safe!) to walk all over Old Town from the riad as it's in a fantastic location for the main sights.

Riad Les Trois Mages,mdcarroll wrote a review Oct 2014,50,a perfect little place,We stayed in Les Trois Mages for 4 nights and could not recommend it highly enough. One of the aspects we appreciated the most was an introductory talk by Aziz which was invaluable when trying to find our barings in a city which doesn't place a high premium on signposts.  The standard of cleanliness was extremely high the breakfasts were delicious and filling. We particularly liked the fact that we could order poached scrambled eggs etc which we really enjoyed. The staff were always smiling and helpful which we appreciated as Marrakesh is very different from most of the other countries we've visited.  One of our highlights was a recommendation by the riad to have dinner at Dar Zellij which about ten minutes walk away. A footman is sent to collect you and the walk there is absolutely magical as there is no traffic en route and the buildings and streets are hundreds of years old you see Marrakesh as it must have been in the 17th century. The dinner is a set 3 course meal and you can choose to pay either approx £28 or £38 pounds. I won't say anything else other that you're missing out if you don't go for so many reasons. All of the other recommendations for eateries were spot on.  We would not have enjoyed our holiday so much if we didn't have such great advice.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Karen P wrote a review Sep 2014,50,"One ""must do"" on a visit to Marrakech",I am just ending another perfect visit to Riad Les Trois Mages in Marrakech. This is one place that should be on everyone's bucket list. A visit here is a chance to live in a traditional riad as opposed to an impersonal luxury hotel or even many other riads which are too modern in style to be cosy and welcoming. Here the rooms are traditionally decorated the riad is small so all guests get to meet over breakfast or on the roof terrace if they want but there is room for all to have their own personal space too. Breakfast is pretty much whatever you like and dietary requirements are catered for as well. Any other meals can be ordered daily and are prepared individually. The staff are delightful and nothing is too much trouble. There must be a reason I have returned 6 or 7 times.........,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenP125
Riad Les Trois Mages,Natandmiriam wrote a review Sep 2014,50,My wish was their command!,Amazing - at any time we could request a hot or cold drink! We often enjoyed a pot of tea after finding our way through the vendors to get back to the Riad. Cold beer or wine is also served.  Staff are really responsive to any need and smile all the time.  One night we had dinner on the roof terrace - very pleasant. Breakfast is plentiful and fresh    The pool is only a few feet deep so only suitable to wet oneself.    Room are large and arranged around the central courtyard.    Large lounge area downstairs with interesting books and well chosen background music playing.. A second relaxing area has a piano and guitar just beckoning someone to play them.,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Melbourne,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natandmiriam

Riad Les Trois Mages,Interstella64 wrote a review Sep 2014,50,Superb Riad,I have just returned from a 3 night stay at Les Trois Mages and genuinely cannot rate it highly enough. We were immediately made to feel welcome by Aziz the manager who provided excellent information on local attractions/navigating the crazy world of the Medina/haggling/restaurants.... All the staff were friendly and helpful constantly making sure you had everything you needed. We stayed in the Bahia Suite which was exquisite. The entire Riad is beautifully decorated with so many lovely touches. The terrace and pool were a very welcome relaxation area.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Londonlin1 wrote a review Sep 2014,50,Wonderful!,From the second we turned up in this wonderful peaceful oasis we felt totally at home. Food was fantastic - especially the fish & morocan salads - we only ordered enough for 1 but it was more than enough for 2! Bahia suit superb - absolutely no complaints at all. Staff - Aziz Saida Laila Moushine - wonderful.    Breakfast massive! If you want to order dinner ensure you order it at breakfast or else you may be out of luck.    Get dinner on the pool terrace at 8 pm - listen to the call to prayer - amazing.    Make sure you take the guided tour round the souk if you are unsure of the layout. He saves you money by doing the bartering for you & takes you to the non-tourist part which is cheaper.    Take pre-loaded travel cash card (eg from post office) as so easy to get money out from ATMs - plenty of them about & better rate than the bank.    Roof top pool an absolute dream you can get a bottle of beer in the Rhiad for 25 Dirhams & wine for 120 (approx 13 to the £).    If you miss TV take your ipad as wifi is free. Lovely outside areas to read or even play piano in.    Aziz can order you taxis from & too the airport (150 Dirhams). Main souk about 10 mins walk. Get the preserved lemons & Ras El Hanout!    Would not hesitate to go back.    Thank you Aziz!,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Londonlin1

Our room was beautiful and we were looked after so well. The rooftop pool area was so relaxing. We would not hesitate about going back.

With free refreshments it meant we had Moroccan tea and water on tap. room had A/C great en suite and little touches that made you feel as home like sheet and duvet if you required.    great restaurants recommended the only disappointment was Aziz the fluent English speaker host was only about on our last night to discuss payment and airport transports.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and definitely will recommend it to others. Plenty of nice little touches and the roof even had a nice little pool (more a for a dip that laps!).    Location is good - it is a short walk to the central areas but feels a little calmer than those areas; don't be alarmed as you approach the hotel - the area might not look the best but it seemed safe to us and we didn't feel nervous going back late at night.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Bath Preservation Trust wrote a review Aug 2014,50,Faultless,My sister and I stayed for 5 nights and celebrated a 50th birthday. We could not have been happier with our choice of riad selected because of the plunge pool on the roof and the excellent reviews. Aziz and his team really are the perfect hosts making you feel at home and providing every sort of information required to make the stay completely stress-free. We wandered in to the kitchen to help ourselves to ice drinks or plates etc and loved the laughing ladies who cooked and served the meals. Breakfasts are substantial but with a range of options and each day we explored the city full of energy after the comforts of the room and refreshments. On our last night we requested an evening meal and ate it on the roof under the floating linen hangings over a low table and soft calico sofas. It could not have been more perfect - with fading heat and the mesmeric call to prayer at dusk. We were privileged to have stayed during Ramadan and felt honoured to witness the riad staff - and the whole city - observing the strictures of this festival.    We did not visit any other riads but spoke to other guests who had transferred to Les Trois Mages after being dissappointed with their first choice. We could see that nothing was too much trouble to arrange and the graciousness with which Aziz and team operate is humbliing. We could not recommend more highly.,Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Bath, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BathPresTrus
Riad Les Trois Mages,Leslie G wrote a review Jul 2014,50,An Oasis in the middle of Marrakech Madness,We had the most amazing time here. Aziz the manager arranged for a taxi to collect us at the airport and deliver us practically to the door. At the riad we were greeted with mint tea and pastries and Aziz spent a good half hour giving us an orientation - pointing out on a map some sights to see how to get to the souks and the square and even gave us a few tips on bargaining.    The riad itself is a dream - between our gorgeous and comfy room (Jasmine) the rooftop oasis and its pool and the wonderful music room and its mini-library we often found it hard to tear ourselves away to see the incredible city of Marrakech. As for the location all the major sights are within an easy walk - the square and souks are about ten minutes away depending on how long it takes you to make your way through the hordes of friendly Moroccans stopping you to say hello (and detour you through the tanneries - be firm!).    The food at the riad was excellent. Saida is brilliant cook and the meals we had here were excellent value and as good as the posh restaurant we went to on our last night.    Finally if you have time do look into the excursions offered by the riad. We went on a tour of the Berber villages and our guide Mohammed was friendly well-informed and delightful company.    We will definitely be back!,Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leslieg615

We were looking for a driver to drive us to the Casablanca airport in the middle of the night and the management arranged everything for us! They even let us stay at the riad during the day after check-out. Everything was so clean and beautiful. There are multiple eating areas and food is excellent. They also allow guests go into the kitchen at any time and grab free bottled water. The pool is beautiful and there are amazing cushioned pool chairs to lay on. There are also multiple instruments (including a piano) and beautiful areas outside your room you can hang out in.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Decman2014 wrote a review Jul 2014,50,The Three Wise Men of Marrakech,Les Trois Mages is really special. Recommended to us by Rachel Blech from SheherazadVentures this riad is in the heart of the medina and beautifully appointed with rooms named after the three wise men – we stayed in Balthazar the wise Arabian scholar (we couldn’t find the 12 litre bottle of champagne of the same title though the ‘wine did floweth’ at dinner earlier). The colours fabrics and furniture along with gold fittings in the bathroom made us feel fully indulged! We made friends at dinner including the owners Annamay from Donegal and her partner Tony and the tagine of fresh fish cooked by ‘in-house’ cook Saida was simply sublime. The riad is full of surprises on the roof terrace there is a swimming pool and snug chill-out zones and off the central courtyard there is a music room with piano and assorted instruments – the perfect party room. We experienced a very warm welcome great generosity and hospitality. We want to go back again and again. We can think of nowhere better to stay (and have a party!) when in Marrakech.

Riad Les Trois Mages,IsobelSylviaAnn wrote a review Jul 2014,50,Absolutely loved it - FANTASTIC staff.,It was my second stay at the Riad Les Trois Mages and it was just as beautiful as I remembered. This time I was eager to share it with my girlfriends so for a small extra cost three of us slept in the Melchoir room. My friends were absolutely delighted with the Riad: from the roof terrace to the music room absolutely everything is as pictured - if not better! Breakfast is plentiful and fresh and the lunch absolutely fantastic - some of the best food we had out there.    Where the riad comes into its own is the staff. Aziz was absolutely wonderful in welcoming us providing a very detailed and clear map - if we could follow it anyone can! Nothing was too much trouble and the complementary mint tea is always a bonus. I unfortunately became ill on my last night - and the women on duty took the best care of me. Fresh honey and orange water was delivered to my door slices of orange to suck on iced flannels and a huge fan - everything someone with heat stroke could possibly desire/need was delivered to me without fuss/extra cost. I couldn't be more thankful.    We went on the guided tour something which we found both fascinating and informative - and had dinner every night in the square. The highlight of the trip for me has to be our hammam experience at the Heritage Spa. It is also worth visiting the Henna Cafe (which is near the spa) as it not only does fantastic food and henna which is the authentic brown (not black and cheap like in the square) but is also a non profit organisation for those in need. As a group of three female 20 year olds we were worried that we would be a target for trouble. And whilst we were a subject of great attention never once did I fear for my safety.    I would 100% recommend this Riad to anyone.,Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Exeter, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IsobelSylviaAnn

Kitchen is always open- guests are welcome to get water anytime from the fridge and let them know if you need anything else.  Position is good- about 10mins walk max to the beginning of the markets and a little convenience store very close by.  rooms are beautiful- we stayed in 3 different rooms thanks to a kind upgrade:) all were special though and i think any room here would be lovely.

Riad Les Trois Mages,minnesotans4 wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Stay here and go on their guided tours,We arrived by train from Casablanca and asked Aziz the manager to arrange transportation to the Riad. We would never have found it without the driver. We had prearranged a tour of the High Atlas Mountains on our first day. Mohammad was an excellent driver and was originally from the Berbers. He told us stories about life there and about life in Morocco. We went on a Tuesday and stopped at a local souk. They slaughter the goats sheep and other animals that day. The produce was exceptional. The sights and smells of the souk were wonderful. People park their donkeys in the back. We also stopped for a tour of a local Berber home with a great shop nearby. The mint tea is truly delicious. Normally I like basic tea but was surprised I liked this tea. We ate lunch by a river and it was delicious. I would recommend taking a half day tour of the medina. Our guide was very informative and helped us barter and took us all through the souks. He showed us landmarks to follow so we wouldn't get lost. The third day we took a tour to the Atlantic seaport town of Essaouira. We had our driver from the first day. It is a wonderful laid back town as compared to Marrakech. Mohammad stopped at a women's cooperative for Argan oil. They showed us how Argan oil is made. We couldn't resist stocking up! Also we stopped to see the goats in the Argan tree. An amazing sight. Another stop was at a thuya wood store. The pieces are beautiful! Our rooms at the Riad were simply charming. The beds were comfortable and the rooms were spacious. Each room has its own style and charm. It is wonderful not to have a tv but there is free Wifi access. Water tea coffee and a very delicious breakfast is complimentary. There is an area on the rooftop for relaxing under umbrellas or dangling your legs in the pool. Aziz and staff really want the guests to have a good experience at their Riad. It is truly relaxing here. We ate dinner one night and the grilled fish was delicious.

You can wear shorts ( men ) ladies take some care. Final point: Random acts of kindness are very unlikely to be so be warned no matter how much on guard you are there will be someone with a very convincing story ready to offer you help.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Miaind wrote a review Apr 2014,50,Wonderful Riad,We stayed here last year (sorry for the late review). The Riad is an oasis within busy Marrakech and lovely to come back to after a day out sight seeing. We stayed in the lovely large Bahia suite. The Riad itself is charming with many different seating areas to make you feel as if you had the place to yourself. Loved the roof terrace where we had a quiet afternoon reading dozing and cooling off in the plunge pool. We had dinner here on our first night and food was the most delicious we had during our trip. I highly recommend a half or full day guided tour of Marrakech as soon as you arrive. Apart from learning about historic sites and places of interest within the old town which you may otherwise miss if you were on your own it was useful having the guide to help us gain our bearings and point out landmarks so we could navigate our own way in the coming days on our own. Overall fab time at this Charming Riad which I would highly recommend.,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bromley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Miaind
Riad Les Trois Mages,Clea700 wrote a review Apr 2014,40,Beautiful Riad,Lovely riad in Marrkaesh although I struggled to find it - the location on Google maps is not where it's actually located it's a few streets away so a local boy offered to help me find it but then got irate when I didn't have enough to give him as I didn't have any coins left. The owner of the riad was kind enough to give him something though.    The room was beautiful and Aziz was lovely ensuring I had some tea and cake upon arrival. It was a shame that I was there for only one night and had an early flight the next day as I didn't get there until late afternoon.    I booked an early taxi for my morning flight with Aziz and asked for a wake up reminder just in case I slept through my alarm but didn't get the reminder so luckily I didn't sleep through. Also I had to wake up the night watchman in the morning and then I started to panic when the taxi driver wasn't at the hotel to escort me to the taxi (I was too scared to hunt out a taxi in the dark in the early hours of the morning) but the night watchman took me to him as the taxi driver too was asleep and not answering his mobile.    I was meant to travel with my husband but he couldn't make it at the last minute so I think if I was travelling on my own I'd stay a bit closer to the town centre as I felt a bit freaked out dragging my suitcase around and not finding the riad's location when I was on my own but the room and the riad itself was lovely.,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Clea700

Riad Les Trois Mages,Pinelakemo wrote a review Apr 2014,50,Lovely Oasis. Great location,Charming ambience wonderful service (Aziz was a standout in Morocco for help) and the food was amazing. The Fresh squeezed OJ in the mornings with special crepes were wonderful. Dinners were among he best we had in Morocco. Room was large and reasonably quiet. Cozy places to relax and the rooftop warm pool was a welcome relief from chaotic busy days in medina or touring. Located in the heart of the action.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Londoner432 wrote a review Apr 2014,50,Beautiful Riad,We stayed in Les Trois Mages for 5 nights. From the very start all the staff were extremely helpful and made us feel at home and looked after. The riad is an oasis of calm is beautifully decorated and has lots of communal areas to sit and relax. Our room (Bahia suite) was stunning. The location was also good as we were about a 20 min walk from the main square with lots of shops and places to eat along the way. There is also a lovely little plunge pool to relax in on the roof. We loved the city and loved having our riad as a little haven to come back to and relax. They also helped with booking our excursions/restaurants etc and nothing was ever too much to ask.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Natlyinuk wrote a review Apr 2014,50,Fantastic place!,My husband and I stayed in the Bahia Suite for 5 nights and loved every moment! The Riad is fantastic and although located inside the walls of the medina it is very quiet and peaceful inside. Aziz and his team couldn't have been more accommodating. All very friendly and Aziz even walked with us on our first day to get some lunch so we didn't get lost. I would certainly recommend this place to others and we would definitely stay here again. The roof terrace and pool were our afternoon favourites after being out all day. Would also recommend to do the half day guided tour the riad offers around the souks - was vey helpful as it was our first trip to Morocco.,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Natlyinuk

Being a lone traveller at times is a bit daunting so it definitely helped to have him there.    The place itself is great very clean & cosy and a lovely roof terrace for late night drinking.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Richard T wrote a review Apr 2014,50,"Les Trois Mages, Marrakech -",Can't recommend Les Trois Mages highly enough. From the seamless collection at the airport to the delicious breakfasts on the roof terrace the service was impeccable. Aziz the manager looked after us really well and made sure we had everything we needed as well as giving us good local knowledge and advice. The Riad is decorated beautifully throughout. The bedrooms are lovely and the relaxation areas and roof terrace are perfect for spending a few peaceful hours. It was about 35C when we went so having the small roof pool was an added bonus.    We did eat in for lunch and the food was good but there are some nice restaurants nearby (10 min walk) that we would recommend. Le Jardin Restaurant had a lovely peaceful atmosphere and great food. Le Terrace Des Epice was quite cool - food was ok but not great. Le Tobsil was our favourite (pricey but very good)    We had a guide (Mohammed) on the first day to show us round the souk. Good way to get your bearings early on and we can also highly recommend Mohammed as a guide. We took our daughter who was 14 and enjoyed the whole experience but not sure I would take kids much younger unless they were used to exotic travel,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardT31
Riad Les Trois Mages,djpend wrote a review Apr 2014,50,This is the place to stay,From the first e-mail acknowledging our booking to the dinner on our final night the service and attention to detail was superb. An 11 bedroom Riad it has a small staff who are all friendly competent and become well known to the guests.. They remember your preferences and are always available. The location on the edge of the old town is good and the public rooms and bedrooms are beautifully furnished in Moroccan style. There is free Wi-Fi. The breakfasts are generous and the dinner we had on our last night was excellent. .Bedrooms on the first floor are varied and quite private. Some are on the ground floor adjacent to the public space so meeting your fellow guests is usual. There is a terrace with a small pool. We visited in March so a bit too early in the year to breakfast there We all loved our stay and would strongly recommend it.,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Preston, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/djpend
Riad Les Trois Mages,frank h wrote a review Apr 2014,50,Great holiday!,"Just spent 8 nights at 3Mages. Great service from everybody - lovely breakfasts and dinners on the nights we ate ""in"". It's amazing that the place can be so quiet and comfortable considering the situation. A few steps from the front door your are In The hustle and bustle of daily life in the Medina. Being a bit older than the average guest (we are in our 80's) we were happy to spend our mornings on the roof terrace and then go out for lunch and to explore. It has to be said that Moroccan food offers limited choices for a long stay and we tried to eat somewhere different most nights. La Bagatelle and the Rotisserie both in Rue Yugoslavie in the new town were really nice and reasonably priced.

The decor of the rooms was stunning and atmospheric giving a true flavour of Marrakech.  However where this place really scores is it's staff from the manager Asis down to the cooks who prepare breakfast nothing is too much trouble.  Mint tea is on tap throughout the day to wash the dust of the city away.

Riad Les Trois Mages,AM4UK wrote a review Apr 2014,50,The perfect break - stay here!,My girlfriend and I enjoyed a wonderful 3 nights at the Raid this March.    Nothing was ever too much for the brilliant staff who looked after us with such diligence. Aziz in particular was a star.    The beautiful building in great upkeep was clean cosy and most welcoming. The downstairs lounges are spacious and provide a calm environment from the hustle of the Medina the roof terrace and pool likewise.    We stayed in the Jade room and it was perfect; 4 poster bed great shower a safe and plenty of space.    Breakfast on the terrace was tasty and very hearty delicious local pastries with fresh yoghurt fruit and the best orange juice.    Easily accessible to both the souks and the nearby Majorelle gardens plus drivers can take you close by in a cab very handy when tired!    We recommend doing a cookery class run by the Riad so much fun to go to the market and source ingredients and then make your delicious lunch.

Riad Les Trois Mages,connecticuttraveler6 wrote a review Mar 2014,50,Lovely riad in the northern end of the medina,We only stayed at Riad Les Trois Mages for one night after a desert tour before heading home early the next morning so we didn't have much time to fully enjoy this lovely riad. We had the two rooms on the ground floor which were colorful and comfortable. The architecture of our room was a little tricky in that there were several different steps of varying heights between the bedroom sitting area and bathroom which was a bit challenging in the dark. Off the main courtyard were two lovely living areas one blue room with a player piano and the other red room with a fireplace that was lit in the evening. There were lots of books and games available for guests to use. Being late March the weather was just right so we didn't have to bother with either heat or AC.    I read some of the other comments about noise of other guests. This is a natural effect of all the riads we stayed in -- with rooms surrounding a center courtyard hearing the sounds of other guests who are up later or earlier will inevitably filter through to your room. Although I did not need them at Trois Mages I keep earplugs handy for those situations which can also help with the early call to prayer especially if you are a light sleeper.    We had dinner at the riad which I would highly recommend. I had a delicious vegetable soup while the others enjoyed the briouats -- stuffed pastries. For a main meal my husband and I shared a delicious beef tanjia served with vegetables and my daughter and her friend shared an enormous chicken pastilla.    We were traveling with 3 sixteen year old girls who were anxious to get back to the Jemaa El Fna square for one last walk around and some more henna (we spent a week in Marrakech before the desert tour). I was reluctant at first as the riad is a bit to the north. However it felt good to walk and didn't really take that long -- maybe 15-20 minutes. It is actually a pretty straight shot to get there once you know the way and Aziz was very helpful supplying us with a map and making sure we knew the landmarks.    We arose early to a delicious breakfast of eggs different breads fresh squeezed orange juice and coffee. My only regret is that we didn't have enough time to really get to know the people and the riad. We loved Marrakech so maybe we'll be back one day!,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Killingworth, Connecticut",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/connecticuttraveler6
Riad Les Trois Mages,Amanda M wrote a review Mar 2014,50,Wonderful!,Had a wonderful time at the Riad! We arrived late on a Saturday night were welcomed by the night guardian who served us mint tea in the lounge and recommended a nearby restaurant for dinner. He was extremely helpful and walked us part of the way there as Marrakech is a very easy place to get lost in!    The riad is very well cared for with several beautiful sitting areas and a lovely rooftop terrace where we had breakfast each morning. The manager Aziz was so helpful and friendly. He made reservations for us for dinner made recommendations on places to visit and sat with us several times just to chat and tell us about the area. He made us feel very at home!    We also took a cooking class with the riad's chef Saida. It was an unbelievable experience! We started by going to the market with her to buy ingredients for our lunch it is truly amazing to see her haggle with the vendors over the beautiful fresh ingredients on their carts. After shopping we went back to the riad where we prepared our lunch in the courtyard...briouats (shredded vegetables wrapped in pastry and fried) and a chicken tagine with preserved lemon olives and vegetables. Saida was very instructive and such a joy to work with!    The riad is very well situated a 10 minute walk to the souks about a half hour walk to the new town and very near several excellent restaurants.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Laura Wheeler wrote a review Mar 2014,50,"Perfect, again!",I have just returned from a 3 night stay at Riad Les Trois Mages for the 2nd time and was certainly not disappointed. I have been to Marrakech several times but after finding this place last year I didn’t feel the need to consider any other accommodation for this trip. This year I travelled as part of a group of 4 (2 couples) and had just as amazing a time as I did with just my mother last year.    I don’t want to repeat what so many others have already said so will merely reiterate the key points: beautiful riad great location lovely rooms stunning terrace and pool but most of all amazing staff! Aziz and the whole team were just perfect they made our trip.    As many people have mentioned before the riad is very peaceful and quiet and being a group of 4 we were very conscious of not wanting to disturb the other guests or to take over. That said we were all in desperate need of relaxation and so chose to spend a lot of our time relaxing in the riad in between popping out for meals and sightseeing. Being such a small riad it is hard not to take over but the staff couldn’t have been friendlier and more understanding –we were continually offered tea coffee and water even though we spent most of our time upstairs on the terrace (we did feel guilty and tried to help with the carrying of trays up and down the stairs)!    Thanks for having us and we look forward to returning next year :),Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Laurakirstywheeler
Riad Les Trois Mages,RachelD1970 wrote a review Mar 2014,50,Great Riad - fantastic service,Just had a 3 night break in Marrakech and stayed in this wonderful Riad. The accommodation itself was lovely and had everything we needed and the food (and wine) was good too. However it was the staff that really made it such a superb stay. Everyone from the kitchen staff to Aziz the Manager were friendly and helpful and seemed to want to make our stay as enjoyable as possible - which they did. We had Morrocan tea and pastries upon our arrival and while we were waiting for our taxi to the airport on our last day they brought us tea and cake (just out of the oven - delicious). The breakfasts were excellent and two of the mornings we were offered breakfast on the wonderful roof terrace despite this meaning the staff had to trail up a long flight of stairs with several courses no-one seemed to mind in the slightest. We booked a day excursion via Aziz to the Ourika Valley in the Atlas Mountains which I would highly recommend and our driver was really friendly and good fun and provided us with lots of information about the region. Aziz also recommended several great restaurants (the best by far was 'Le Comptoir') booked us a table and transport to and from - we didn't need to do a thing. Overall we had a fabulous trip and very much enjoyed staying in this oasis of calm in a sea of chaos.,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Batley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RachelD1970

Riad Les Trois Mages,Rupert1416 wrote a review Mar 2014,50,"Wonderful stay, highly recommended, amazing staff",I wanted to start this review by saying a huge thank you to Aziz the Manager who could not do enough for us during our 3 night stay at this wonderful Riad.    We hired the whole Riad as a group of friends. The rooms were clean well equipped and well designed.    The Riad staff made us breakfast lunch and dinner and the food was beautiful they bent over backwards to ensure we had a good stay recommending other restaurants and organising a tour of the Medina as well as airport transfers.    The roof top terrace was gorgeous with lots of seating areas and a small swimming pool. There were two seating areas on the ground floor which had books and board games and a piano.    Our flight wasn't until the evening but we were allowed to stay beyond the check out time and were given free Moroccan tea and biscuits such a lovely touch that you don't find in corporate hotels.    The bathrooms had free toiletries beautifully designed in the Moroccan style. The rooms don't have a TV but this was welcomed as it meant we could just enjoy ourselves and forget about work and home for a few days.    I highly recommend this Riad I wouldn't stay anywhere else.

The staff and facilities were amazing. The Riad was completely authentic with spacious bedrooms and a beautiful (well needed) roof top pool. We had dinner at the Riad on our first night which was a real welcoming to Marrakesh. Absolutely delicious. I couldn’t fault this Riad in anyway. Even though it was a 20min walk from the 'main town' I prefered being just outside of the main hustle and bustle and enjoyed walking in taking Marrakesh in.  I've been to Marrakesh a few times and would recommed this over 4/5 star hotels. If you're going to Marrakesh you need to do it properly and stay here.

Every member of staff were kind and helpful always willing to being complimentary teas coffees and water. There are only 6 bedrooms and so the hotel has an intimate family feel at the same time as having complete respect for your privacy. The night manager was there to greet us as we returned from dinner each night and although the Riad can't serve alcohol the honesty bar was always available!  We spent our Sunday cooking with Saima an amazing woman who guided us through the food markets in order to buy the produce for lunch we then proceeded to cook Tagine and couscous dished which we then enjoyed with a glass of wine up on the roof terrace.  Loved the stay and would thoroughly recommend a stay here....the hotel is a little tricky to find first off so I would suggest looking at a map before arriving as the road is not accessible by taxi so you need to be dropped off at the top of the road about a 100m walk to the front door.,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Croydon, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/400lucindab

Everyone was wonderful and so attentive. Aziz however went above and beyond.  I left my iPhone in the room at checkout and when we were on the plane heading to Spain he emailed twice asking if we were still here and if we could come back to get the phone. We couldn't unfortunately so he mailed the phone to my home in the US using HIS OWN MONEY. I don't think any American or European hospitality worker would have done that without hesitation.

You won't find this kind of personal kindness and out-of-the-way gestures in hotels in Europe or the United States.  The room we stayed in had windows that opened on to the courtyard -- the top half was covered by glass and the bottom had no window bars so we had to keep them closed.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Claire B wrote a review Feb 2014,50,Best Experience,When going away I usually book a big hotel and go via a travel agent. This time we sought advice from Trip Advisor and we were so glad we did. Les Trois Mages offers a service that I have never experienced. Pure excellence! Just having 6 bedrooms you are treated to such a personal experience and made to feel like royalty. The staff are so attentive and kind. You arrive with a huge welcome and fresh mint tea and a complete explanation as to what you can expect from the area regarding trips and excursions that are available along with great recommendations from previous holiday makers. Aziz makes sure you are collected from the Airport with a professional english speaking driver and given a magnificent breakfast of fresh yogurt pancakes fruit and eggs. Along with copious amounts of tea and coffee and water included in your stay. There is a lovely roof terrace where we had breakfast with a heated pool. The fire is lit for you at night if you wish and the only thing you need to do is relax. Aziz makes it his duty to make sure you have everything you need and can he help you with anything. I can honestly say I have never been so spoilt and felt so cared for. At one point we left our camera at a busy restaurant. The staff popped on his scooter and drove to the restaurant to collect it for us. We were left alone when needed but could ask for anything and we were welcome with open arms and a friendly smile. I would most definitely recommend this lovely little Riad to everyone. The only two things I would advise to anyone staying in Marrakech in general would be to take ear plugs for the prayers in the morning that you can hear throughout Marrakech itself. (wherever you stay you will hear this) and be aware that it takes an hour to get out of the airport at passport control.,Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Stevenage, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/946claireb

Riad Les Trois Mages,Julia M wrote a review Jan 2014,50,Amazing Riad,Our stay in the Riad was awesome everybody was so polite. Everything was clean and the breakfast was delicious. You get fresh orangejuice and coffee or tea on choice yogurt with fresh fruits fresh bred pancakes and egg if you want to everything with jam and honey. You also can get water tea or coffee whenever you want. The rooms were comfortable and there is a lot off space in the riad to chill-out after a day in the medina especially the beautiful rooftop-terrace.  The staff was so nice to us. Aziz can answer you every question you may have and will give you a really good map and overview of the city. Also he can arrange quite nice trips for you to the atlas-mountains or other places you want to see. Saida was cooking for us a really delicious dinner and was taking care of us the whole stay.  We both really recommend this Riad. You may can find cheaper ones but we don´t think that they would take care of you as much as the staff of this Riad did.,Date of stay: January 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hamburg, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliam849
Riad Les Trois Mages,bopinion wrote a review Jan 2014,50,great experience,As some of the reviewers have said previously Marrakech is quite the experience! your first impressions as you arrive down the busy streets avoiding mopeds and pedestrians is the frantic nature of the place. The Riad however is absolutely fantastic. As you are shown through the building you find all these areas to sit and enjoy your time either eating drinking or relaxing. Aziz greets you and makes you feel so welcome as do all the rest of the team who are very helpful. We were given plenty of advice and there was always someone on hand. The room we stayed in was also impressive and just what you need after spending all day in the souks. We stayed in January and it was not as warm as I expected so dress appropriately!,Date of stay: January 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Reigate, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bopinion
Riad Les Trois Mages,t3anders wrote a review Jan 2014,50,A home away from Home,Marrakesh can be an absolutely overwhelming experience but Riad Les Trois Mages was an amazing oasis.    Before arriving Aziz was so incredibly helpful. He made sure someone was waiting for us at the train helped get us settled in offered a personalized map of the Medina and made sure we had his number in case we needed anything. He booked dinners for us and followed up on plans we had arranged ordered us car services (with amazing people who waited for us with no complaints and never left us high and dry... you'd think that's a given but it's not!) and was just an ace person to have on the front lines. He really made us feel like we were coming home when we walked into the Riad.    Our room to say the least was spectacular.. A welcome relief was a beautiful hot shower and a cozy bed with the most perfect linens and decor.    We also utilized having dinner at the Riad and it was equally exceptional.    I cannot say enough for this Riad.. The cost is minimal compared to the overall experience you will have at this home away from home.,Date of stay: January 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Toronto,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/t3anders

Riad Les Trois Mages,Claudette B wrote a review Jan 2014,50,Fantastic Riad,The most outstanding feature of this Riad is the staff. We stayed here as a group of 7 for my 40th birthday and it was a truly fantastic experience. The riad itself is very well positioned and very quiet which is suprising given its proximity to the souks etc. As a group we had 4 of the 6 bedrooms but I personally stayed in the Bahia Suite which was fabulous and well worth the bit extra money but all the other rooms were lovely too.  Being December the temperature changed quite dramatically so we went from swimming in the heated pool or just lazying around it in the sun to snuggling up around the fire in the evening playing boardgames. We were lucky enough to do a cooking workshop with Saida too. What a wonderful woman! She took as to the local market and then showed us how to prepare tagines and other dishes after (including mint tea to which we also seem to have fall in love with while we were there). We then ate what we had prepared and it was delicious.  On another day we had booked into a hammam and Mouhsin was concerned we would not find our way and insisted on taking us there. Thank goodness he did as we would have never have found it alone.  For my actually birthday my mother and boyfriend had pre arranged some drinks snacks and a birthday cake with Aziz. for the evening before we went out. I can't tell you how fabulous the staff were at setting it all up and arranging it all and insisting on staying to sing happy birthday felt like they were part of the family by then. A memory that I will always treasure.    It is these little touches that made our stay truly memorable    Thank you to all the team for going out of your way to make us feel so welcome.  We will definitely stay here again,Date of stay: December 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claudetteb2014
Riad Les Trois Mages,Graham S wrote a review Jan 2014,50,Amazing Riad,I would like to say that everything was as I expected. The staff were very helpful both managers (Aziz and Mouhsin) couldn't do enough for all of us.  Even though it rained on one of the days the atmosphere only added to the experience.  The Riad is quite central to all the main attractions of Marrakech and we only had to ask Aziz or Moushin to book / help prepare events or guides for us.  Overall I would highly recommend Les Trois Mages to anyone.,Date of stay: December 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/121grahams
Riad Les Trois Mages,David101 wrote a review Jan 2014,50,Couldn't do enough for us..,A spacious relaxed gem of a place with some of the nicest staff I've ever met.    5 or 6 rooms over 3 floors means lots of nooks and crannies for as much peace and quiet as you want. And as you are in the centre of the medina you only have to step outside the front door to be swept away into the hustle and bustle.    Every member of staff went out of their way to make sure we had everything we wanted and seemed to genuinely feel that we actually become part of their family. I've not experienced such attentive service in anything less than a five star hotel before.    The food was also wonderful - breakfasts and snacks of pastries and fresh fruit and bread on the roof terrace were divine and Saida's special prepared dinner was our best meal of the trip.    A special thanks to Aziz the local manager and to Moushine the night porter who were absolute gentlemen and who coordinated everything superbly. Aziz arranged a road trip into the Atlas mountains for us - amazing! - and an unforgettable visit to a luxurious hammam for the full Marrakech experience. ;)    We had an incredible stay and will certainly be back.,Date of stay: December 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Amsterdam,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/David101
Riad Les Trois Mages,Emma H wrote a review Jan 2014,50,Highly recommended riad,At Les Trois Mages its the people that make the difference. The riad is beautiful and comfortable with a lovely sunny roof terrace with cute dipping pool and a cosy lounge with open fire which was wonderful on December evenings when it was a little chilly. The bedrooms are stylish and comfortable and the bathrooms are rustic yet chic. But really what the riad is all about is the team who run it - Aziz Mouhsine Saida Najia and Laila. They made us feel so welcome nothing was ever too much trouble and everything was done with a smile. By the end of our week it was like saying good bye to old friends. I highly recommend this riad to anyone looking for a restful retreat within the medina who appreciates excellent service.,Date of stay: December 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmmaH49

They brought us endless trays of tea and coffee with little pastries ( all free) and would bring us wine and olives even though they didn't drink.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Marie P wrote a review Nov 2013,50,Return visit necessary!,"My sister invited me to join her for a holiday in Marrakech. I had no idea what to expect and to be honest was too busy trying to keep up with work before holiday to research. Thank goodness for big sisters! Sis stayed twice in Marrakech before this trip - the second time at riad les trois mages. I am so glad she chose to return to les trois mages. My first impression was slight unease as the journey showed how chaotic moving around could be - pedestrians/donkeys/people pushing hand carts/mopeds/bicycles/cars all vie for the little space there is. On entering the riad I could only feel peace and serenity comfort and a wonderful sense of bonhomie. Relaxation came naturally! Aziz Mouhassim Saida and Layla were always on hand to assist- Mouhassim ensured our safety even escorting me to local shop late at night to get snacks and juice for our last farewell night with fellow guests who became friends as we enjoyed their company over the holiday. I can honestly say no other hotel stay has given me so much pleasure. Unique unusual clean comfortable friendly great service - the review allows for 5 marks and ""excellent"" I would like to give it more and if lucky eniugh to ever come back to marrakesh would definitely want to stay at Les Trois Mages.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Jatf63 wrote a review Nov 2013,50,Wonderful Riad with wonderful people.,I went to Marrakech with my husband for my 50th birthday. After a pretty awful delay we finally arrived at this wonderful haven to be greeted by the charming Moushine who made us feel at home from the first moment.    Our room (Melchior) was stunning. Kindness was extended with the gift of a bouquet of flowers left in the room..lovely touch.    I thoroughly recommend the cooking class with the wonderful Saida. You get a chance to wander through the local market to source the produce and the chicken could not have been be any fresher !!! ( I will say no more) back to the Riad for tea then aprons on and let the cooking commence. A few hours later we sat and sampled what I can only describe as authentic moroccon cuisine. Delicious.    Aziz and the staff really couldn't have done any more for ustheir kindness and hospitality was second to none.    We met some very nice guests and we shared not only a few drinks but many laughs that we shall remember for a long time..    We simply cannot recommend this Riad enough and is the perfect retreat from the crazy hustle and bustle of what is a wonderful city.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Robert R wrote a review Nov 2013,50,A wonderful holiday,My wife and I went with another married couple for a week at the end of October beginning of November and loved it. Aziz arranged two day tours for us one to Essaouria and one to the Atlas Mountains both of which were excellent and he was assiduous in ensuring we had all we needed. On our first night and on two more occasions during the stay we had dinner in the Riad which was excellent with the wine being a good deal cheaper than in those local restaurants that served alcohol. Moushine was equally helpful when Aziz was not there not least of all in organising a taxi to get us to the airport and the service from the ladies at breakfast and dinner was very good. We also used the roof terrace on occasions which was also lovely. We would strongly recommend the Riad. Our only sorrow is that we missed Aziz by getting back late from Casablanca - on our experience Moroccan trains do not always run on time - and so did not have a chance to thank him personally for his very great help.

We visited the Riad before booking and even then everyone was very helpful and kind.  Aziz is such a friendly and genuine person! He gave us precious advices/ tips which made us feel more confident in exploring the Medina! We just regret not speaking French or Arabic to interact more with Saida Moushine Najia and Laila.  The Riad is super clean with comfortable bed beautiful architecture and lovely staff. Oh and the breakfast was fantastic too!! Fruits yogurt great variety of bread/ croissants jams butter honey AND we were also offered eggs cooked to our taste!!  Make sure you have dinner at the Riad at least once! We are so glad we did! It was the best food we had tasted in months!!!  Also organise a transfer to and from the Riad. It is well worth it as you might get lost in the Medina.

Riad Les Trois Mages,mds wrote a review Oct 2013,50,An Oasis amidst the chaos,My first trip to Marrakech began with a stay in this Riad in the Bahai room. We arrived in the early evening after a rather hectic Royal Air Maroc experience. Upon arrival in Marrakech what an eye opener to the uninitiated with the noise the chaos the people the motorcycles the cars the sheep... With each turn off of the main road the road shrunk from small to narrow to a virtual alley. The car parked at the entrance of one of these alleys and our driver walked us through a maze and after a couple of turns stopped at a large wooden door (I confess I was getting a little concerned at this point). The door opened and we were greeted by the friendly smiling face of Mouhsin (I apologize for any misspelling). And behind him...the Oasis: The courtyard of Riad Trois Mages. Our host immediately offered us a refreshment (as he did every night afterwards) then took us to the Bahia room upstairs. It was beautifully appointed and true to any photos professionally posted. Once settled Mouhsin recommended restaurants within close walking distance then promptly made a reservation for us on the terrace of the chosen restaurant without being asked. Be sure to stay at the Riad for dinner one night. The food is every bit as good as any restaurant you will find. The staff was always friendly and smiling (even when carting our breakfast or dinner up to the terrace for us!). Aziz the day manager is very pleasant professional and knowledgeable particularly with tips for surviving the Souks. Everyday was as enjoyable as our first impression that we believe set the tone for our entire trip in Morocco. We highly recommend this jewel.

My lovely warm welcome after the flight followed by a delicious meal sent me to bed already relaxing in my favourite room Arabesque. Aziz the new manager is a find! I noticed subtle differences like a new taxi service from the airport or incense and scented oils around which was lovely. He was around all day every day and always making sure guests had whatever they wanted. The maps he gave out had all been carefully marked with focal points to guide you and roads marked for walks and contact numbers for the riad and him - it must have taken hours but very helpful. As usual the girls who look after the rooms were keeping all up to scratch and Saida fed everyone excellently as usual.

We were lucky to stay here during our first visit to Marrakech. From the time we made the booking I was emailing with Aziz to coordinate transfers dinners and tours and he was extremely responsive and quick with answers and solutions. The Riad was so lovely we had a hard time leaving to venture out into the souks! The rooftop terrace is lovely and the plunge pool is a nice way to cool off after a day of exploring. We felt extremely safe the entire time we were here. Either Aziz or Mouhsin the night guard were always available to answer questions or even to run out and get a Diet Coke for us! The location of the Riad is easy to find once you know your way around. Aziz will review the map with you upon arrival but I recommend arranging for a guide for the first day until you find your bearings. We arranged a tour with Mohammed and he was very nice and let us navigate our way back to the Riad from the square so we would be confident on our own.

I arrived alone and was greeted by the wonderful Aziz who manages the Riad. What a gentleman! He looked after me from start to finish and he couldn't have been more accommodating. He escorted me to and from my hammam treatment in the maze of the medina and waited with me for my taxi to the airport when my transfer didn't turn up. The Riad itself was luxury at its best. I had the pick of 5 bedrooms all of which were beautiful. The other staff were friendly and always smiling and always on hand with mint tea and assistance of any kind. I recommend anyone staying here do the cooking class which I enjoyed immensely even though I had saffron stuck in my nails for days afterwards! Particularly enjoyed the market shopping with Saida the Riad cook and of course the wonderfully laid out dinner we had prepared and cooked ourselves. One of the best experiences and definitely the best accommodation I had during a three month trip where I stayed in many hotels from budget to boutique to luxury.

Riad Les Trois Mages,An'Ton R wrote a review Oct 2013,50,Toni & Gina,We had a wonderfull stay at Marrakech which was full of experiences and impressions which we will not forget so soon. One of the highlights of this stay was the Riad Les Trois Mages. This riad is the right mixture between European desire to have all clear and clean and the pulsating orientalic life. It was for us a real throwing table between both worlds. We could enjoy European standards and orientalic colours and smells in one and we could go out to experience the intensity of this real fantastic city and come back and feel europeanlöike and orientalic in one. So we loved it to stay there.  Architecture of this riad is fantastic and we loved the suite very much. Staff is very friendly and they were intensively engaged in fulfilling all our wishes. Special thanks to Aziz who is a very competent and friendly manager. He was strongly keen in helping us whenever we had a problem or a wish but he also offered us the right information on our questions on culture history and ways of living in Marocco and Marrakesh. Breakfast was top and we enjoyed it very much. We have already recommended the riad to friends and collegues.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Helen I wrote a review Sep 2013,50,Amazing place,We stayed here for 4 nights in the the first week of September 2013 and loved it. In insane loud Marrakech it is unbelievably peaceful as soon as you walk through the door.  Aziz arranged transfers for us from the other hotel we'd stayed at (and back to the airport) for a very reasonable rate which was added onto the bill. When we first arrived he then sat us down and gave us a map of the Medina explaining how to get to the souks and the square and pointing out some good places to eat and drink as well as giving a few handy tips for dealing with locals. There's more of this kind of info in the Riad's guidebook which is really helpful.  The roof terrace is idealistic with loads of comfy sun loungers as well as a proper cosy seating area. The plunge pool was always a good way to cool down after getting a bit too hot in the sun. The only down point is the interruption of the call to prayer which can't be helped anyway.  The room was lovely and always spotless with a comfy bed and good air conditioning. We were never woken up by the call to prayer but occasionally kept awake by other guests of the hotel chatting.  We ate in the Riad on one of the nights we were in the Medina and it was incredible food and very reasonably priced - would recommend!,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelenAndWill
Riad Les Trois Mages,mrowan808 wrote a review Sep 2013,50,Great place to stay in Marrakech,My husband and I spent a week at the Riad Les Trois Mages in July 2013. What a fabulous place to stay!! The staff are friendly and helpful and go out of the way to accommodate any request for information or travel in the area. The plunge pool on the roof was great to come to at the end of a hot day of walking around the city. The food was tasty - we had a couple of suppers there in addition to the breakfasts. The owners happened to be visiting when we were there and we found them delightful and very interesting conversationalists. All in all we would highly recommend staying there.,Date of stay: July 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Waikoloa, Hawaii",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrowan808
Riad Les Trois Mages,lenny wrote a review Sep 2013,50,Honeymoon heaven,My wife and i spent hours researching a place to stay in Marakesh it was our honeymoon and also our first time away from the kids so it was so important to us that we found the right place. Thankfully our research payed off because we struck gold. Our taxi was organised a few days before we arrived and was added to our bill so nice to see your name in the airport and not have to worry about are you paying to much - plenty of time for that. On arrival after mint tea and a chat we were shown to our room a massive bouquet of flowers awaited us. We stayed in the Bahia suit which is absolutely stunning! (saw some of the other rooms too which were also amazing) Little things like having a fridge and an i pod stereo are not to be underestimated. Free bottled water ice. Many's the afternoon we spent sitting in the pool drinking a Gin and Tonic listening to music. The roof garden was one of the many reasons we chose Les Trois and it didn't disappoint. Complete nirvana away from the madness of the streets. The Riad is so close to everything and around the corner is a Big Riad/Hotel which is a great landmark for when you ineviatabley get lost. Souks and square are 10 mins away. Oh and the breakfasts! Sweet mother of god the breaky is fit for a king.  All this aside the best thing about the Riad for me was Aziz. I work in hospitality and would be fairly big into good service. Aziz is one of those managers who is always there when you need him but who also knows when to leave you alone. He gave his mobile no. and it was just a nice feeling to know he was there if we needed him. They don't molly coddle you there. It feels like your home. It kind of is. For musicians the Piano and guitar would be a nice addition to your stay.  I just cant say enough good things about the place. I'm not one for writing reviews this is my first but credit where it's due.

Riad Les Trois Mages,JayR0gers wrote a review Aug 2013,50,Sanctuary amongst the madness of Marrakech (enjoyable madness),Where Marrakech was an assault on your senses and wore the traveller down Les Trois Mages was the most comfortable and peaceful retreat you could ever find. Brilliantly and comfortably decorated impeccably clean and expertly ran by Aziz and all the other Moroccan staff.    We loved this place so much we returned at the end of our Moroccan adventure. The food was amazing (thank you Saida) and Aziz could not be helpful enough. Anyone looking for the perfect map of Marrakech go see Aziz; very helpful. Day or night Les Trois Mages had an amazing ambience and the rooftop pool was a brilliant touch after a trip to the souks or Djemaa el-Fna. Much needed.    I have already recommended a stay at Les Trois Mages to some friends who are already planning a trip to Morocco and would highly recommend it to any body else considering Marrakech.    While you are there go to Le Jardin for a meal or cold drink too. :-)    Thank you Aziz and all at Les Trois Mages for making our stay so enjoyable.

We had a wonderful wonderful meal prepared by the lovely Saida in the courtyard of the riad and Aziz arranged for Moroccan dancers to come which was fantastic fun.    The rooftop pool was also an absolute winner and rare to find in Marrakech.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Outside101 wrote a review Jul 2013,30,Small & Noisey but cosy & endearing.,English owned and a Eng MNGR until next week a then Aziz (a lovely guy takes over). ABS Gent and credit to Riad. We were warmly greeted by Aidan and Staff. Given the lowdown and Map. Very helpful. Room Jade was OK colourful and nice shower area. AC worked but needs 20mins to get going WIFI worked in your room.    Usual lock and bolt story which is noisey and we are all around the courtyard which at breakfast time is annoying as laughing loud guests will wake you up.  Location very poor and again issues with your personal security. Be aware.    Staff are superb we met the owners lovely chaps & very good pianist and breakfast was the usual unimaginative Maroc breakfast.    all in all a mix bag but if you rented this place as a group (which you can) I reckon you will be very pleased and quite happy with your decision.    PS Hassan the fixed rate Taxi driver for this Riad please do not use him he is RIP off Merchant and very cheeky chap. He Tooks us for 200DH on a 100DH fare. IF he is ripping us off then I assure you AZIZ he ripping off all your guests.

Riad Les Trois Mages,engaged_11 wrote a review May 2013,50,"Calm ,clean and cool",From the moment I booked Raid Les Mages Aidan the hotel manager took us under his wing . Organising a transfer from the airport a cooking class and a special dinner nothing was a problem . The Raid was small making it an intimate stay getting to know the other guests .It was clean calm and had air conditioned rooms which made it pleasant to come back to after the bustle of Marrakech. We were treated regularly to mint tea and home made biscuits while relaxing on the roof top poolan added bonus to swim and relax by the pool in the sun .The breakfast was included and had a slight variety each morning so we never got board . A short walk into the main square made this a convenient location .

Riad Les Trois Mages,Smilie_Traveller wrote a review May 2013,40,"Brief stay in gorgeous, cosy, quiet riad in great location",We stayed 2 nights in this great riad including our arrival night. The airport transfer arranged by the riad was seamless. We stayed in the Melchior room which has very beautiful decor and is comfortable and a good size. Only minor downside is that it adjoins the courtyard where people dine and was therefore not as private as we may have wished. The location is ideal - right in the centre of the Medina allowing you to walk everywhere and the riad staff were fantastic in providing directions and recommendations. We ate dinner on our arrival night and it was a great introduction to Morocco with a fanstastic tagine and good wine. Overall definitely recommended.,Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Edinburgh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Smilie_Traveller

You couldnt of met a nicer person ever he was always on hand to help you with bookings directions or anything you could think of. We cant thank him enough for making our honeymoon so special.  Can't forget aiden Who was so nice and helpful and just a bloody good bloke made such a difference having an english speaking manager to help out with places to go and booking taxi's.

Riad Les Trois Mages,deb p wrote a review Apr 2013,50,An oasis of calm!,Our first time in Marrakech we loved everything about our 6 night anniversary trip. The Riad was a delight. A calm clean relaxing haven just on the edge of the bustling souks. Perfectly located for all that we wanted to do. We could have just stayed there all day every day however as it was so pleasant to sit or lie on the terrace taking occasional dips in the plunge pool to cool offor to rest on the sofa's in the courtyard in the coolreading and drinking tea. Our room was exactly as promised on the website directly off the courtyard which I had worried might feel a bit exposedas other guests ate in the coutyard at breakfast but far form being an issue we enjoyed the proximity and I would happily choose the same room again although we peeked into the 'best ' room one day when it was empty and would love to stay in there too-it looked stunning! All the staff were very helpful and the food cooked by Sadia was delicious and could be ordered in advance at a time to suit. We returned from a 4x4 trip to the Atlas mountians (arranged by Aidan) to a wonderful dinner on the terrace served by Moushine who was always smilingwhatever the time of night!

It was wonderful we stayed at beginning of April. We were both impressed with our room 'Jade' which had a beautiful four poster bed and lovely spacious bathroom. Our taxi Hassan met us as planned at the airport and Aidan welcomed us to the house. He took us for a walk in the medina to find our bearings which was great as my daughter was able to guide us back each time we went out otherwise you could get very lost in the souks as we did one day! He was also there on hand when we had an anxious moment and required some first aid. We went out one evening to the crepperie and Aidan arranged for Hassan to take us and pick us up again. Nothing was too much trouble!    Saida Moushine Najia and Laila were always there to provide coffee or tea when we returned from our walks. Our room was made up every day and clean towels provided. It was wonderful to relax on the rooftop by the pool and have breakfast served to us.

Riad Les Trois Mages,MarkandBx wrote a review Mar 2013,50,The Stars Shine Brightly!,Our stay at Riad Les Trois Mages - (The Three Kings) - was fitting for Kings (and Queens!).    I had done many hours of research looking for just the right Riad to fulfil a dream of visiting Marrakech - and Les Trois Mages more than exceeded expectations.    The service guests receive during their stay is superb! Aidan the Manager has absolutely the 'right' touch - always on hand to help and assist; interested in your stories and with effortless charm. Saida the Chef - whose smile and heart-warming greeting envelops you when you return from a 'bonkers' day haggling in the Souks - always ready with a pot of tea (English or Mint) and beautiful little pastries; her cooking is out of this world! Moussin the Night Manager who was always on hand and nothing was ever too much trouble even when we asked him to 'russle' up a little snack late one evening - not on the menu! And then the lovely ladies Lela and Nadj - who could never do enough and were always so kind and gentle.    Lasting memories: The service and smiles and kindness of everyone in the Riad - saying good bye on our last day - was like saying good bye to old friends. Our private dinner on the first floor Bou; Saida's cooking class - a highlight of our trip and a MUST DO for anyone who wants to visit; breakfast and eating lunch on the Terrace under azure blue skies and the sounds of the call to prayer; the beautiful bedrooms and sitting downstairs in the blue lounge listening to Nina Simone on the in-house CD player while Moussin went about the house putting on all the beautiful evening lights.    I have returned home with so many beautiful memories .... Go to Riad Les Trois Mages and experience these for yourself - and then sit like I am today looking out on a very cold and snow-filled landscape - and let these memories warm your heart!

Riad Les Trois Mages,brendonh wrote a review Feb 2013,50,Brilliant!,Great place friendly staff especially Moushin the night guard who due to our timing help us the most during our stay.    The Riad is located down a smaller but reasonably well lit alley and away from the main souk so it as quiet but we still felt safe walking there.    The taxi arranged by the riad for 20 euro was able to drop us right around the corner which is unusual for the medina. The night guard was very friendly and explained to us the areas of Marrakesh and showed us around the riad. Breakfast included in the rate was standard for Morocco but very nice on our second day they happily accommodated our early departure and prepared breakfast for us early.    We had two rooms they were both a good size with everything we needed the shower had plenty of hot water and the beds were comfortable. We found the whole property to be very clean and comfortable. The riad really feels like home with unlimited access to tea coffee and drinking water and reasonable honesty bar in the kitchen. The roof top terrace with pool is a great place to relax after the craziness of the medina and there was free wifi throughout and a solar heated roof top pool surrounded by lovely patio.    We pre ordered dinner for our first night for 20 euro pp for three courses expensive compared to the stalls in the medina but very well priced compared to other Riads and large restaurants. Overall it was very nice and well worth it. Aidan the manager was happy to ring and make reservations at other restaurants for us also.,Date of stay: January 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Auckland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brendonh

The rooms are excellent and the roof top pool and sun loungers are awesome. The pool isnt big but large enough to cool down.

We arrived in the centre of Marrakesh and it was still oh so very hot - but that is where the similarities ended. Gone was the twittering of the Chaffinches and the gentle hiss of the sprinklers - instead a barrage of noise - mopeds revving locals shouting horns tooting prayers blaring.. total chaos. As exciting at it was I was already started to wonder if we could really handle this for 4 days whole days.    Our taxi driver (Hussain I believe?) had been sent by Riad Trois Les Mages to collect us. We were very wary of riding with him at first. His unairconditioned beaten up (and dirty) 1980s hatchback was not all too reassuring. However he turned out to be a delightful character - insightful helpful and very amusing. Thank goodness he knew Riad Trois Les Mages well because we would not have found it without him. Away from the dust and the barrage of noise we arrived at the door of Riad Trois Les Mages - and stepped into our little piece of paradise.    Mouhsin was there to greet us. Mouhsin is possibly the sweetest man I have ever met. With a broad and welcoming grin he bowed his head to us and gestured towards the open air courtyard. It was cool it was calm and it was silent - bliss. Mouhsin walked us around the beautiful property from the music lounge to the reading room the terrace to the kitchen. He pointed out that we free to use absolutely anything on show including books instruments and even the fridge. I would describe the décor of this property as sumptuous elegance. The finishing touches are rich luxurious and bright while the overall feel remains light and spacious. The pool on the terrace is something quite hard to find in a Riad but it is an extra worth having at that time of year.    After our tour we were sat down to enjoy mint tea and a selection of Moroccan sweets. Mouhsin gave us a tourist map and carefully talked us through every item of interest on there marking out the best route to take. He kindly reminded us that he would take us anywhere that we weren't sure of or would organise transport if he couldn't. We were told time and time again that this was our home for the next 4 days and that we should treat it as such. Despite being incredibly attentive Mouhsin absolutely understood how to be on hand without being under our feet. He stuck that balance perfectly.    The food we had at Riad Trois Les Mages was some of the best we'd had anywhere in Morocco. Good honest home cooking from the lovely ladies in the kitchen who always had a warm smile for us. The dinner that we had there on the 2nd night was the most romantic that we'd ever had. Mouhsin dressed the table beautifully with a crushed red satin table cloth and candle sticks. I watched him while he worked and the attention to detail that he was putting in was incredible. We could tell how much he wanted it to be just perfect for us. As we sat down to eat Mouhsin and the cooks left us to eat alone. The only company we had was a little Chaffinch who sang his song as he flew from hanging lantern to hanging lantern. I've never experience a better setting for dinner in my life.    If one thing is for sure - we will be back again and again and again. We hope to bring friends and family with us next time as it would just be the perfect hang out spot for us all to enjoy together. My advice to you is to go and experience this magical little Riad for yourself.,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Redhill, Surrey",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mslouisebrain
Riad Les Trois Mages,Jude_Paradise wrote a review Jan 2013,50,Very short stay over New Year!,My husband and I had a 2 nights stay at this Riad after returning from Sahara Desert. I have to say we enjoyed our stay here very much and would definitely recommend to those who are planning to visit Marrakech. The raid is located on a very quiet street approx. 15 min walk from the main square. At first we thought the location was a bit sketchy but after awhile we realize almost all riads in Marrakech are located in these side streets which give a sense of quietness from the chaotic main streets. It is also located very close to a main parking lot so if you ever get lost in Marrakech you can easily tell a cab driver to drive you back to this parking lot then there will be no issue finding your way back to this raid.    Another amazing experience in this raid is mainly from the manager - Aidan. He is the most sweetest hotel manager I have ever seen! He made us feel like home all the time and very accommodating. For our second night we had to catch a flight in the early morning so had to leave the riad at 1:30am and Aidan stayed up for us and helped us take the luggage to our driver who sent us to the airport. He was also so smily and helpful to all of our requests. I think he really made a huge difference to our experience.    Overall a great and memorable experience!,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Toronto, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jude_Paradise
Riad Les Trois Mages,Anna R wrote a review Jan 2013,50,Made our trip to Marrakech!,This Riad was great in all respects! We stayed for three nights including Christmas. We were 5 people and stayed in 3 different rooms all of which were great. We ate breakfast lunch and dinner here several times and the food was SO AMAZING. They made us this soup called harira - if you go you must get this! We took a cooking lesson one day with the Riad's chef which was so fun. Every staff member was beyond friendly and helpful. I actually got deathly ill one day (think it was something I ate at a restaurant - should have just stuck with Trois Mages!) and one of the staff went with my boyfriend to the pharmacy to help him communicate and got me anti-nausea meds. We also wanted to go out one night and they were happy to arrange for a car to pick us up/drop us off at our destination. On Christmas they served us champagne and treats which was really nice of them. Will definitely go back if I ever make it to Marrakech again!,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"San Francisco, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theweekendjetsetter
Riad Les Trois Mages,Michelle Connolly wrote a review Jan 2013,40,6 night stay over New Years,I stayed here with some girlfriends and we would definitely recommend it if you want an authentic riad experience with exceptional service. There are 5 rooms i think decorated quite traditionally. The rooftop sun terrace and pool is a massive bonus and we spent a few hours catching rays even in December! They provide towels and there are a few sun hats up there.    The riad is about a 15 minute walk from the square - once you find the quickest route. And it really is a calm respite from the craziness. The staff are all very helpful! Great suggestions for trips. And the breakfasts are delicious! Oh and they serve beer and wine at the riad! Overall fantastic experience.,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichelleConnolly41
Riad Les Trois Mages,Anne C wrote a review Jan 2013,50,A Thank you present visit,We came to stay at Les Trois Mage as a thank you present from my daughter and her husband. We enjoyed the stay immensely and felt very spoilt by the staff who were most attentive..nothing was too much trouble for them. In fact we almost felt like we had a personal butler in Aidan the manager who came and spent time with us each morning helping us decide what to do during the day and booking us trips drivers guides meals out etc...talking of the food it was of a very high standard the chicken tagine was gorgeous...and the chocolate mouse divine!! ( we had this 3 times!!) The atmosphere and ambiance in the Riad was magical! There are number of very comfortable and extremely tastefully decorated communal sitting rooms...sumptuous is the word! We benefitted from the roaring log fire as the evenings in November were a little chilly. During the day we benefitted from the lovely plunge pool and 'Arabian Nights' style tented area on the roof where we lounged and drank the fantastic mint tea on offer! We had a real treat at one of the Riad recommended and 2 minute walk away Spa's ..well worth the money fabulous massage and Hamam! The rooms ..well they were FABULOUS! We had the suite and felt like royalty with a sitting room as well as a sunken bed!! It was quite frankly like being on a television set for Aladdin!  WHilst we were there we sadly had bad news which cut short the holiday for my daughter and husband. The night porter was so kind and went the extra mile to help organise emergency flights back home we can't praise the staff enough they were all so kind.  The location of the Riad is fantastic it takes about 10 minutes to walk into the main square. We would recommend a guide when going into the souk as it is a bit of a rabbit warren!! We had one and think that if hadn't we might still be there!! We had a very interesting and enjoyable trip to the Atlas mountains with a lovely guide who knew his stuff....Aidan recommended & booked this for us at a very reasonable price!  It is a real haven of peace when you walk through the doors of the Riad you really wouldn't think you were in the bustling old part of the city...however take ear plugs because at 5.00am there is the call to prayer every day. It is no real problem and It didn't cause me any problems with the ear plugs...and my husband slept right through it!! HIghly recommended!!!!,Date of stay: November 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Stockton-on-Tees, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnneC138
Riad Les Trois Mages,NOLA P wrote a review Jan 2013,50,My 30th birthday stay at Les Trois Mages,12 frends and I stayed at Les Trois Mages for a long weekend to celebrate my 30th birthday.    We had the most fanastic time and would highly reccomend Les Trois Mages.    The Riad is magical each room beautifully decorated and no attention to detail spared. We really enjoyed and made full use of the communal spaces having a lovely breakfast served to us in the sunshine on the roof terrace each morning playing games next to the open log fire on an evening and enjoying the array of instruments in the music room.    The staff were all wonderful extremly warm friendly and accomodating helping us with anything we needed from preparing fresh teas and coffee all day and night cooking ordering taxis and helping us make table reservations. We also organised our transfere to and from the airport though Aiden and this proved to be very convenient. Aiden and his staff have a wealth of local knowledge and simply couldnt do enough for us. It really made our stay enjoyable.    We enjoyed a lovely home cooked lunch when we arrived at the Riad i would highly reccomend having at least one meal prepared by the staffat the Riad. Everything was very fresh and tasty and there was a good balence of meat and vegitarian dishes. We would have eaten more meals at the Riad if we were there for longer.    The riad always felt like a safe and tranquil haven to return back to after the hustle and bustle of daily life in the Madina. The only thing we would have changed is to have had longer to enjoy Les Tres Mages. We will definately be returning.,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Lee, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NOLAP_13

Riad Les Trois Mages,stevecwf wrote a review Nov 2012,50,Our 50th birthdays present to each other.,Having been to Marrakech more than once Marrakech is still an eye opener to me. The city is the real tale of two! with the old medena and the new very European quarter.  Les Trois Mages is hidden away in the medena and from the moment the entrance door opens is a haven away from the hassle and bussle of the streets. From the courtyard you can view straight to the blue sky above and the reason you came here relaxation and the more than warm winter sun which can be taken advantage of on the roof terrace.  During our 5 night stay we were looked after very well by all the staff morning noon and night. Morning it was breakfast on the roof terrace noon tea or coffee also on the roof terrace and in the evening after being out for dinner coffee in the sitting area next to a beautiful log fire.  We stayed in two rooms during our stay the Arabeque and the Bahia Suite both lovely rooms to stay in though the Bahia is the one to stay in if you can the bed is something special.  My best stay to date in Marrakech and probably not the last at les Trois Mages.  This was my partners first stay in the medena itself and though she was not too sure about being there the riad made it all worth while.  Thank you all again at Les Trois Mages for making our 50th birthdays treat so special. And thank you Aidan for the flowers in the room you sorted for me for Andrea.  A real little gem worth every penny.  Andrea and Steve now in cold UK.,Date of stay: November 2012,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevecwf
Riad Les Trois Mages,johnmcb123 wrote a review Nov 2012,50,Excellent Riad / Excellent location,This is a great place . We stayed 3 nights and wished we had booked four ( or more). Taxi from airport doesn't take long and should be booked in advance through the Riad. The rooms are lovely and there are several places to relax including the roof. We had the Bahia suite which we loved but feel sure that all rooms would be good. We ate lunch and dinner - both were very good and the food was plentiful. Staff are very good and friendly. For Marrakech first-timers take advantage of the walking tour - an easy introduction to the Medina maze.  Location is excellent - a short walk from the main square but not in a tourist street so surrounded by good safe local life.In the other direction just a few minutes walk away are the city walls and quick access to the new town.  This is an ideal place for a city break  made easier by no time differenece to UK when we visited in November.,Date of stay: November 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Dorchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnmcb123
Riad Les Trois Mages,steveroper wrote a review Nov 2012,50,A haven in the madness that is Marrakech,We stayed at Riad Les Trois Mages with 2 other couples as a celebration of my wife's 50th birthday. The 3 night stay was a delight and Aidan and his staff were superb throughout. The location is right in the middle of the action so to speak as it is within the walls of the old town and easy walking distance of the Souks and renowned El Fna Square with its bustling and manic medina. Marrakech is not for the faint hearted as it really is like going back in time and poverty and hardship is there for all to see. It was safe though although at times slightly intimidating but that added to the excitement and atmosphere. The riad is gorgeous. Food superb. Staff could not do enough for you and Aidan knows all there is to know. He arranged for us to spend a day in the Atlas Mountains following the Berber Trail....it was one of the most amazing day trips we have ever taken and we have been to places like Thailand Vietnam Kenya and Dubai New York etc so have seen both sides of the way people live. To sum up Marrakech...it is a must place to visit and Les Trois Mages Riad played a big part in us having a superb time.,Date of stay: November 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Ipswich, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steveroper

Hot water mint tea and coffee available throughout the day. Lovely breakfasts. A pleasure to stay there.

When we booked they were really helpful at arranging transfers from the airport. The reception when we got to the riad was wonderful. We arrived at about 9 in the evening and were greeted with mint tea and sweet snacks.  The room was lovely as was the whole riad. Very helpful staff and water tea and coffee available free when you need it. Also help to get to the transfer point for our next destination the following day.

Riad Les Trois Mages,ourluxorflat wrote a review Jul 2012,50,"""Melchior"" at Les Trois Mages Riad",Being fascinated by North African Muslim cultures we've been trying to visit Morocco since 1975! The opportunity eventually presented itself and after trawling through the vast number of riads and reviews here on TA and elsewhere our minds were finally settled on this room at the “Three Kings” in Marrakech.    Although our EasyJet flight from Manchester was delayed by about two hours the (arranged through the riad) transfer man was there patiently waiting for us and whipped us away to our home for the next four nights. We were so glad to have made this arrangement as we would have really struggled to find the house otherwise; Marrakech medina is a rabbit warren of twisting and turning streets many of which are only a metre or so wide!!!    Aidan the English manager welcomed us and we were in the room in no time. It's lovely! There are no hidden disappointments and the pictures are true to life. We had ordered meals for our arrival which were absolutely delicious and very filling Saida the cook is very obliging and cooks the meals (which are heavy on meat content) to perfection! All the staff at the riad were very good cheerfully providing pots of tea (tea coffee and water are available all the time without further charge) at all hours of the day or night and exactly to my specification!    Being in the medina Les Trois Mages is ideal for exploring this utterly fascinating area. Aidan provided us with a walking guide who was very personable and spoke excellent English and who took us through many tiny streets which were a hive of manufacturing activity. We would never have found these by ourselves and thought the expense of the guide to be money well spent! Afterwards we were able to find our way around the various souks which sprawled between the riad and the Djemaa El Fna without any difficulties. The walk took us about 25/30 minutes. Although it's only a half mile we kept stopping to look in shops etc. and it was the middle of summer with the temperature reaching 49c!    The availability of a laptop in the lounge was a very useful addition and the Internet connection was really quite fast. We need to have constant access to our emails for business purposes and were delighted to not have to hump our own laptop through all the security checks at the various airports.    Although quite 'authentic' and traditional the room door locking and plumbing were rather quaint possibly because of the historical French influence but perfectly adequate. (In fact you could have the shower jetting out hard enough to actually hurt if you wanted to!) Hot water was constant and plentiful as were the shower consumables and the white towelling bath robes were well large enough to stretch around my 'ample' girth!    We had a look at the roof terrace and pool which looked very welcoming and clean but were of no particular interest to us although the other guests were making frequent use of these facilities.    All in all I would not hesitate to highly recommend this riad and the room we occupied (Melchior) to anyone visiting Marrakech. On future visits we would certainly like to stay here again.,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Luxor, Egypt",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ourluxorflat

The Riad itself is lovely we were lucky enough to stay there for a few days on our own as there were no other bookings so had the roof terrace to ourselves. Saida made us lovely pizza for lunch made from fresh!    our room was perfect we were in the Melchior Room we only had to open the doors take two steps out and we were in the courtyard where breakfast was served our room was clean spacious and it was lovely that you could just leave the door open and pull the netting across.    There are no faults to be found with this Riad and especially not with the staff its such a laid back haven from the hectic and intense Marrakech outside the four walls it was so nice to come in from the chaos into the tranquil peaceful home from home we have already recommended to a few of our friends and highly recommend anyone to stay there its absolute bliss!,Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bexleyheath, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/branners1984
Riad Les Trois Mages,worldtraveler wrote a review Jun 2012,50,Oasis of helpfulness and calm,We stayed in the Riad for three nights. The Riad is peaceful and lovely and the Bahia Suite was large and comfortable. By all means take up the Riad's offer on a taxi from the airport. The medina can be a bit daunting for first time visitors. Aiden was helpful on all details and arranged a wonderful trip to the southern oases and Sahara which worked out very well. We had a very early departure before the normal breakfast hour but they arranged breakfast for us nonetheless. The one unexpected thing to be aware of is that all the rooms open onto the courtyard so you can hear some of what goes on below and in other rooms and if your windows are open other guests can see into your room.

I never usually write reviews but I was taken back by the kindness shown to us. If we ever needed help or advice the staff would do everything to help us. The riad is wonderful excellent value for money comfortable and spacious rooms good breakfast with mint tea coffee or water available at anytime for no extra cost!!!

Riad Les Trois Mages,opotts wrote a review Sep 2012,50,Lovely staff and tranquil haven away from the bustle,Travelling with family and friends with family all really well welcomed by the staff. Mousine was particularly helpful with recommendations of where to go insights into Marrakech and Moroccan culture/life (we were there during ramadan) and even booking and collecting tickets for our onward journey to Essaouira! The Riad is both stylish and comfortable and the rooftop pool is an absolute godsend. We booked for of the rooms (and had a nosey at the other room and suite) and would be delighted to stay in any of them.

The manager (Aidan) is great - he is helpful and all you can ask for in a manager.    The girls who loil after the place are great and friendly - it helps to speak French but it is okay if you don't :-).

Riad Les Trois Mages,ourluxorflat wrote a review Jul 2012,50,"""Melchior"" at Les Trois Mages Riad",Being fascinated by North African Muslim cultures we've been trying to visit Morocco since 1975! The opportunity eventually presented itself and after trawling through the vast number of riads and reviews here on TA and elsewhere our minds were finally settled on this room at the “Three Kings” in Marrakech.    Although our EasyJet flight from Manchester was delayed by about two hours the (arranged through the riad) transfer man was there patiently waiting for us and whipped us away to our home for the next four nights. We were so glad to have made this arrangement as we would have really struggled to find the house otherwise; Marrakech medina is a rabbit warren of twisting and turning streets many of which are only a metre or so wide!!!    Aidan the English manager welcomed us and we were in the room in no time. It's lovely! There are no hidden disappointments and the pictures are true to life. We had ordered meals for our arrival which were absolutely delicious and very filling Saida the cook is very obliging and cooks the meals (which are heavy on meat content) to perfection! All the staff at the riad were very good cheerfully providing pots of tea (tea coffee and water are available all the time without further charge) at all hours of the day or night and exactly to my specification!    Being in the medina Les Trois Mages is ideal for exploring this utterly fascinating area. Aidan provided us with a walking guide who was very personable and spoke excellent English and who took us through many tiny streets which were a hive of manufacturing activity. We would never have found these by ourselves and thought the expense of the guide to be money well spent! Afterwards we were able to find our way around the various souks which sprawled between the riad and the Djemaa El Fna without any difficulties. The walk took us about 25/30 minutes. Although it's only a half mile we kept stopping to look in shops etc. and it was the middle of summer with the temperature reaching 49c!    The availability of a laptop in the lounge was a very useful addition and the Internet connection was really quite fast. We need to have constant access to our emails for business purposes and were delighted to not have to hump our own laptop through all the security checks at the various airports.    Although quite 'authentic' and traditional the room door locking and plumbing were rather quaint possibly because of the historical French influence but perfectly adequate. (In fact you could have the shower jetting out hard enough to actually hurt if you wanted to!) Hot water was constant and plentiful as were the shower consumables and the white towelling bath robes were well large enough to stretch around my 'ample' girth!    We had a look at the roof terrace and pool which looked very welcoming and clean but were of no particular interest to us although the other guests were making frequent use of these facilities.    All in all I would not hesitate to highly recommend this riad and the room we occupied (Melchior) to anyone visiting Marrakech. On future visits we would certainly like to stay here again.,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Luxor, Egypt",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ourluxorflat

Aiden helped us out with booking restuarants etc we ate in some wonderful places we highly recommend Crystal at Pacha and Le Comptoir.    Hassan the taxi driver was such a brilliant character.    The Riad itself is lovely we were lucky enough to stay there for a few days on our own as there were no other bookings so had the roof terrace to ourselves. Saida made us lovely pizza for lunch made from fresh!    our room was perfect we were in the Melchior Room we only had to open the doors take two steps out and we were in the courtyard where breakfast was served our room was clean spacious and it was lovely that you could just leave the door open and pull the netting across.    There are no faults to be found with this Riad and especially not with the staff its such a laid back haven from the hectic and intense Marrakech outside the four walls it was so nice to come in from the chaos into the tranquil peaceful home from home we have already recommended to a few of our friends and highly recommend anyone to stay there its absolute bliss!,Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bexleyheath, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/branners1984

One tip - If you get lost in the Medina or even look remotly lost do not take the advice of the boys on the street who will take you the long way round and ask for money for the privledge.    Thaks Aiden and staff for making our holiday what it was. We will defiantly return and we're be bringing the kids with us next time.

Aiden helped us out with booking restuarants etc we ate in some wonderful places we highly recommend Crystal at Pacha and Le Comptoir.    Hassan the taxi driver was such a brilliant character.    The Riad itself is lovely we were lucky enough to stay there for a few days on our own as there were no other bookings so had the roof terrace to ourselves. Saida made us lovely pizza for lunch made from fresh!    our room was perfect we were in the Melchior Room we only had to open the doors take two steps out and we were in the courtyard where breakfast was served our room was clean spacious and it was lovely that you could just leave the door open and pull the netting across.    There are no faults to be found with this Riad and especially not with the staff its such a laid back haven from the hectic and intense Marrakech outside the four walls it was so nice to come in from the chaos into the tranquil peaceful home from home we have already recommended to a few of our friends and highly recommend anyone to stay there its absolute bliss!,Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bexleyheath, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/branners1984

We were able to walk everywhere. Dinner was a good idea for our arrival evening as one need's to be fully prepared for the onslaught that awaits outside!!! Nice roof terrace for chilling out.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Sarah P wrote a review Nov 2011,40,A special place,Being at Riad Trois Les Mages is like being a cherished house guest. Aidan the English manager is a gem. The Riad is a conveniently located oasis from the vibrant souks the staff are loyal and really care about your holiday experience. It's stylish and upmarket at a reasonable price with a personal touch.  Don't underestimate the benefits of a venue you can buy a bottle of wine that's not from Morocco at a reasonable price or the location of the mini-pool on the roof terrace (rather than the more usual courtyard) which you'll actually use. The staff will happily organise a taxi or book a tour for you a real benefit in Marrackech.,Date of stay: November 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Southampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SarahP735
Riad Les Trois Mages,gilesmorte1 wrote a review Nov 2011,50,Simply devine!!!,Magical!!! This is the second time I've stayed at Les Trois Mages and it is so beautiful!! I first stayed in 2008 with a friend. This time I went with my husband and our two children. Moushine remembered me from last time!! How amazing is that?? !! Even the room we stayed in. This riad has 6 bedrooms over two floors around the central courtyard. We loved just relaxing on the rooftop terrace whether lazing on the sunlounges while our children played in the pool or lying on the daybeds. It felt completely heavenly!!! The breakfast were delicious and the perfect start to the day. After spending our days wandering amongst the little alleys in the medina and shopping in the souks  it was wonderful to retreat to the tranquility of the riad. I really feel Les Trois Mages is the ONLY place stay in Marrakech.  Cafe Arabe and the Kozybar are definately on the must go list. Both have gorgeous rooftop terraces.    My verdict - the perfect break away from normal life.,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,london,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gilesmorte1

Riad Les Trois Mages,Sami00004 wrote a review Oct 2011,50,"Fantastic, welcoming, beautiful, helpful Riad. A*",This was my second time in Marrakech and I decided to spend a little more on a Riad than last time - thank goodness we had a wonderful stay and I would recommend Les Trois Mages to everyone! Beautiful rooms first class service a homely atmosphere not far from the Souk free wifi and an English speaking manager (which makes a big difference in Marrakesh). Aiden and his team were indispensable to our entire stay in Morocco - I've now stayed in three different (supposedly) 4* hotels in Marrakesh and can safely say this is the only one worthy of the rating - others are pretty but the service is often slow/bad and they can't make your stay as relaxing and enjoyable as Les Trois Mages. On our last 2 nights we had booked another Riad and found ourselves reminiscing about this one instead.

Riad Les Trois Mages,s0phieess0n wrote a review Oct 2011,50,Could not have been more helpfull,I have not travelled much and was a little bit terrified as our banger of a taxi drove into the manic Marrakech medina taking us to our riad. As soon as we walked in the door and were greeted with mint tea I felt the panic leave me and I isntatly relaxed into the holiday. Aidan came and sat with us and gave us some good maps and great adivce on bars/cafes/restaurants. He then walked up all the way to the square which is only 10 or 15 mins but greatly appreciated due to the hustle and bustle of the medina streets. The riad is in a residential/locals area so not that touristy which made me nervous the first time we walked into town but everyone is nice and friendly.    Our room at the riad was the Jade room. It was perfect big enough for us and our bags and very clean. The shower was great too something I really rate in a hotel. I saw it said in previous reviews but for some reason didnt take note until I did it for myself - the Riad food IS the best that we had in Marrakech. My only regret is that we only booked dinner for one night!    We went on from this Riad to Essaouira and then back to Marrakech for one night before flying home. The last night in Marrakech we stayed in a more expensive riad that is amoung the top 5 rated on trip advisor but I would genuinely rate this one up there too (and its better value!). Book it you wont regret it. Oh and book dinner too!!,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Warsash, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/s0phieess0n
Riad Les Trois Mages,ThatTime wrote a review Oct 2011,50,Perfect in every way!,As regular travellers we dont compliment people and places as often as we should however we feel compelled to write a review for this magnificent Riad. Now a riad as apposed to a hotel is a very different thing in a hotel its just that a hotel in a riad or certainly our experience of this one is an oasis a home from home its just like visiting with friends. In essence its how all accomodation should be.    The initial booking process with the super helpful and prompt communication from Anna and Aiden was faultless and really helped us feel safe and secure about arriving in an unfamiliar city. We were as promised met at the arrivals hall by our driver complete with little sign with our names on it he then showed us to the cash machine (you cant take Dirhams into the country) he then took us on a very interesting journey into the riad which is situated deep in the Medina. We were taken down to the riad along well lit passageways and met at the door by Mohsine (never a nicer more gracious man have we met) and shown into the main area offered refreshments and left to settle. I really dont want to write this as a blow by blow account of our trip however every detail of our stay was so perfect that I almost feel I have to.    We were shown our fabulous room complete with gold snake head tap and wrought iron bed. Dinner was then served by the ever present Saida and we knew we had made the right choice the food was magnificent as was everything we ate during our stay.    Nothing was to much trouble for any of the staff Aiden the manager was superb attentitive and unobtrusive be it organising a guide for the souks or recommending a restaraunt. We hardly saw any of the other guest however when we did they were like minded travellers who were enjoying themselves as we were.    The location of the riad is a 10-15 min stroll from the main square either down a main street or the more adventurous way via the souks ideal to go out for the day or a bite to eat.    One night we really did feel like we were at home we had had a day of exploring had come back enjoyed some time on the beautiful and peaceful roof terrace came down stairs got a bottle of wine and lounged about whilst my fiance played the piano perfect. Where else can you do that?    The trip was so special for us and the riad so perfect that we got engaged one night whilst sitting on the terrace with our feet in the pool.    Go and stay here you will not be disappointed.,Date of stay: September 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Ayr, Scotland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThatTime
Riad Les Trois Mages,Lee B wrote a review Sep 2011,50,Perfect haven from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech!,Just got back from a long weekend in Marrakesh and I must say that Riad Les Trois Mages was the perfect choice for our trip. Its location was 'spot on' being a 10 minute walk to the main square and just outside the Souks. The staff were very helpful and friendly and made us feel at home throughout our stay. Saida cooked up a storm of a Tanjia on our first night which we enjoyed in the beautiful courtyard. Overall we were both very happy with our stay and would recommend it anyone who is heading to Marrakesh.,Date of stay: September 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leeb108
Riad Les Trois Mages,klooqdcfc wrote a review Sep 2011,50,Absolute pleasure!!!,When you think that I booked into this Riad entirely and purely on the basis of previous reviews to spend a weekend in a country I've never visited before has never been so easy or pleasant! I guess there is always a sense of trepidation when as a seasoned traveller like myself who is used to staying in hotels you usually know what you are going to get with the major chains. However this guest house is a jewel within the Medina and I can honestly say that I shall return sooner and for longer! The Riad is owned by Tony and Anna a couple from London and managed by Aidan an English guy who lives locally. They are all thoroughly nice people who can't do enough for you during your stay and I seriously mean that! The Riad is fairly non descript from the outside and may even concern you a little the first time upon arrival when walking down the alley ways. Your fears are immediately allayed once the door is opened and you step inside this contemporary Moroccan building which is of such quality that you won't want to leave. The ground floor rooms are comfortable and welcoming. The piano is open to anyone who cares to tinker and I spent a few hours listening to delightful music floating up to our room on the first floor. The welcome from the staff was very friendly and the whole place just soothing and relaxing. I could go on forever about this place but I'll stop by saying that you will have nothing but a good time here with extremely pleasant people wonderful rooms a superb terrace with pool and lounge chairs delicious food whether breakfast lunch or dinner and a great location with easy access to enable you to discover the Medina and it's magic!! Thank you very much Anna Tony Aidan Saida Moushine Najia & Laila. Loved it and see you all soon!,Date of stay: September 2011,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/klooqdcfc
Riad Les Trois Mages,Tracy112 wrote a review Sep 2011,50,Never a dull moment.,The Riad truly has a unique Moroccan setting with a pleasant atmosphere. Much more than what I expected. I am a traveler of exotic areas and the majority of hotels I have slept in overnight have the same basic dull plain and colorless rooms;a television of 10 inches a small decaying sofa and a view of the hotel garage. Archaic and nothing interesting. However in this Moroccan hotel we have beautiful plants exotic carpets an open courtyard that lets in a fresh breeze at night and a romantic setting of the stars. Once you enter you will be greeted by Aiden the hotel manager. He is a very resourceful and a delightful person to meet. He welcomes and accommodates guest. In addition Aiden has great tips if you have any questions or concerns about Marrakesh .    I recommend that you take a tour around Marrakesh. Aiden can arrange the tour. Bring money since there will be fees to enter museums palaces and gardens. The prices are low for each entrance.    The service is fantastic the staff members are very polite and sweet and therefore will all these varieties fused under one hotel I couldn't ask for a better stay.,Date of stay: September 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tracy112
Riad Les Trois Mages,dallmand wrote a review Aug 2011,50,Great place to stay,Stayed here for a week in March and loved it. Aiden arranged a taxi to pick us up at the airport. We were a bit concerned when we got out and walked down the side street but as when we got throught the door I knew we'd made the perfect choice. As soon as our bags were in the room we were given mint tea and cake then Aiden walked us to the main square through the souks to help us get our bearings - a sign of the brilliant hospitality shown all week. We stayed in Melchior for the 1st 3 nights - then in Bahia for 4 nights. Loved the rooms especially Bahia - there are only 6 rooms so it feel like you're a guest in someones home rather than a hotel. All the rooms and lounge area overlook the courtyard and the sun terrace was a welcome respite after a day exploring the crazyness of the city. Breakfast was served in the courtyard each morning and we also ate dinner there the 1st night. On our last night it rained heavily and as we had an early start we decided to stay at the riad but hadn't ordered dinner (dinner is only cooked if preordered) - Aiden came to the rescue by getting us takeaway of chicken and chips Moroccan style and a bottle of wine to wash it down. Altough the ladies in the kitchen didn't speak much english it didn't seem to matter - they just know how to take care of you. If you want to just chill out in the lounge area at night then the large open fire gets lit and tended for you with more servings of tea if required!    If you want a 5* hotel with people fawning over you and a restaurant bar and room that could be anywhere in the world then this is probably not the place for you. But if you want somewhere that makes you feel like you're in Marrakech with an authentic feel of the city 5* hospitality and an oasis of calm from all the crazyness of the souks then this is perfect.    NB - of all the tips you get about do's and don'ts when in Marrackech I'd say the ones to remember are -  you will get lost in the souks whether you like it or not even with a map so enjoy the adventure -  don't take a picture of anyone unless you're willing to pay them -  you will probably be charged by most people trying to show you the way so always carry small change just in case -  don't be afraid to say no when in shops even after haggling -  under no circumstances go to the leather tanneries unless you can stand the stench and then want to be royally rippped of by a queue of people from the men who run the tannery to their family/personal friend who owns the extortianate leather goods shop. Having told our 'guide' we only wanted to go if we could just look and had no intention of spending any money there (we had been warned about the tanneries) we were then faced by a group of very irate agressive people looking for very substantial tips - we refused to pay and made a hasty exit.,Date of stay: March 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Northern Ireland, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dallmand

From the moment we arrived we were greeted with a warm welcome by the host Aidan and all his wonderful staff. All the rooms were beautifully presented clean and with air-con (a must if you visit Marrakech in the middle of summer!). There are also ipod docking stations in the rooms so you can listen to your own music and also a laptop downstairs for internet use. Breakfast was included in the price and served every morning and included a large variety of options - nothing was ever too much trouble for Saida and the others to prepare. The rooftop pool was lovely and there were sofas in the shade on the roof to take cover from the sun.    Location is perfect - about 15 mins walk down to the Souks. Aidan very kindly accompanied us down there so we wouldn't get lost! Be prepared to do a bit og haggling though and don't accept the first prices offered. You'll be surprised how much traders will reduce their prices!    Overall a wonderful stay made all the more enjoyable by Aidan and his wonderful staff.

It is such a lovely peacefully and quite place. The best to disconnect from the busy life outside on the streets. Everything decorated in such a detailed perfect way with wonderful colourful taste and I have never felt more home in a Hotel than this time. There are plenty of salons where to rest the room was spacy and comfortable and so well decorated. The bathroom was a dream as well. The terrasse is wonderful with a small pool which was very refreshingas we stayed in the most hottest time a lot of comfi furnitures and all looks like 1001 nights dream. The staff was wonderful descrete and friendly felt like beeing part of a family. We did not ate there (also I am pretty sure we missed a lot!!) but we had breakfast which was really good. Perfect service! I absolutely highly can reccomend this Riad. The location is perfect we NEVER got lost so easy to go to the place Jamma el Fna.

Riad Les Trois Mages,roscocat wrote a review Jun 2011,50,Perfection!,From the moment we came through the arrivals gate to the second we all left the Riad waving a fond goodbey to Aidan and his wonderful staff we had the best time our every need was catered for throught out and nothing was too much trouble. Sadia's food was fantastic and Adian was the perfect host. After arranging our trips and outings with Aidan via e-mail and phone before leaving the UK I found everything was taken in hand by the time we arrived. The Riad is perfectly situated close to the medina (about 10 min stroll) and we found it easy to get back after the tour guide showed us around the first day. The 4x4 Atlas Mountins trip is a must as is the walking tour of the medina (its better to do this first then you know where you are!!!) the roof top pool is a blessing and we had a wonderful afternoon sunbathing and splashing around Sadia served our lunch under the tented seating area and then later Aidan arranged for a local couple to come and give us massages at the Riad rather than leaving our blissfull sanctuary to visit a Hamman. If your looking for a traditonal Riad with masses of features finished to a high standard with a family feel and great food this is the place for you. Highly recommended and I would love to go back.,Date of stay: June 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roscocat

Les Trois Mages is positively gorgeous. Our room was beautiful decorated the bed comfy even the bathroom was beautiful. There are several sitting rooms as well as a gorgeous rooftop pool and a tented sitting area where we read and sipped wine throughout a rainstorm.    We found it to be very conveniently located. We were definitely glad to be in the medina. It was only about a 10 minute walk to Djamaa El Fna (typically longer for us as I shopped my way up and down our route each and every time.) We were able to walk to Jardin Majorelle as well as other areas of the newer section of town.    The staff is incredible. Moushine helped us get settled helped us sort through a slew of restaurant recommendations and even walked us to the restaurant so that we wouldn't get lost our first night there. We were so taken with Les Trois Mages that we planned the rest of our 2 week stay around when there were openings and Aiden helped us plan a fantastic itinerary and had so many really great recommendations. Aside from being great at their jobs Les Trois Mages staff is just incredibly friendly.    We will undoubtedly stay at Les Trois Mages whenever we have a chance to return to Morocco.,Date of stay: March 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Milwaukee, WI",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/babblingbrook78
Riad Les Trois Mages,John C wrote a review Apr 2011,50,The best service and nicest people you will find.,We have a two year old daughter and the people at this RIad couldn't have been nicer. Our first visit to a Muslim country and we found it to be very educational.    This was a little intense at first as the drive in was through the narrowest streets I've ever been on with nary a tourist face to be seen. The Riad is in the Medina though a healthy 15 minute walk from the center.    Once we got into the Riad it was fantastic. The nicest most eager to please people I've ever been involved with. They absolutely adore children and it shows. The GM Aiden is a terrific resource and was very helpful. It really felt like a special place inside the walls. Total family 'vibe' though we were the only ones with children. We never heard another guest and the experience was terrific.    The food they serve is really good and I would recommend at least one dinner in house. It's made with care by people who do. We were in the Melchior room which was big enough for the three of us. We tried for the suite but it was booked.    If you want to be pampered and served dinner by people you'd invite over for dinner - this is the place for you. Felt like someone's home and not at all the formal or impersonal vibe you can get in some hotels.    Luxe....? Not particularly but plenty nice for us and we generally stay in the 4 to 5 star range when it comes to lodging.    Absolutely recommended if you're not afraid of a little walking to get to the more central destinations.,Date of stay: April 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Schecky1
Riad Les Trois Mages,Samuelc85 wrote a review Apr 2011,50,10/10 Lovely experience overall.,We stayed at Les Trois Mages for 3 nights. It's very close to the main square and markets (15 min walk). The riad itself is very clean and well presented with it's traditional Moroccan decor. Rooms were a nice size and very clean and well presented. It has a nice roof terrace to chill out in sun bathe or take a dip. The best part of all is the overall service and the staff on board. Very warm welcoming and made our stay a better experience. We got plenty of help from the riad manager in booking tours and restaurants ad well as tips on navigating the city. I would very much recommend the half day (full day also avail) guided tour early on in your stay as it made the rest of the trip easier in getting around. All in all a great experience and would strongly recommend.,Date of stay: April 2011,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Samuelc85
Riad Les Trois Mages,ChristineStamford wrote a review Apr 2011,50,Oasis of calm in a very busy city,The service from this riad from booking to leaving was first class. Aidan emailed us with useful information after booking and arranged a driver to collect us from the airport. We arrived to mint tea and croissants.  The rooms are lovelydecorated in a traditional Moroccan style with air conditioning. There are plenty of relaxing spaces in the riad from cool lounge areas to a lovely roof top terrace with small pool sun loungers and a shady area to sip tea.  All the staff were wonderful. Saida kept us well fed and Moushine looked after us very well.  Aidan arranged a trip to the Atlas Mountains for us and also recommended and booked restaurants for us.

Riad Les Trois Mages,jillklogan wrote a review Apr 2011,50,A little oasis from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech,All the staff at Les Trois Mages were helpful and friendly and we were made to feel at home immediately we arrived. Even the local taxi driver hired by the riad to collect us was part of the welcome as he spoke English and took charge of us straight away. Our room - Melchior - was delightful - loved the bathroom fittings! Saida cooked fabulous meals for us and we totally relaxed in the welcoming cosy atmosphere. We found having a guide to take us through the souks on the morning of our first full day there was very helpful and interesting. It was interesting how many days we were told by random men in the street that we were very lucky as today was the Berber market and they would take us there!! It's clearly the local tourist trap line so if you are prepared to pay a tip for being taken to a shop and spun a line about carpets or whatever then fine - just be prepared that all seemingly kindly offers to show you this that or the other always require a tip for their 'helpfulness'. But generally people were friendly and pleasant. There are plenty of interesting places to see and trips to take and Les Trois Mages was always lovely to come back to.,Date of stay: April 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Southsea,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jillklogan

Riad Les Trois Mages,Jamie Ross wrote a review Apr 2011,50,"Fantastic venue great ambiance, wonderfull staff",From the moment we met the Riad staff at the airport we felt we were in safe hands. The transfer was quick and well organised to the Riad. Upon arrival we met the staff and were immdetially welcomed by the manager Aiden. The rooms are beautifully decorated and very clean. The food served in the Riad was as good if not better than in the more expensive restuarants in Marrakesh. We wish we had ate in more often as the settin and care the staff took to not only prepare the food but seve was excellent. The roof top sun area and pool is a haven from the hussle and bssle of the bust streets around tye riad. We took a number of the recomended excursions from the staff and all were very well organised and great value. We particularily liked the idea of a night watchman/helper the Riad have. On two ocasions late at night he was able to obtain last minute items from local shops.  The Breakfast does require a mention. Sitting in the big white towelling gowns supplied in the rooms whilst eating Fresh local produce cooked to order and plenty of it. Very good.  I thouroughly recomend Les Trois Mages at as a base to se Marrakesh as well as the mountains and Desert. Wonderfull hospitality and great value.,Date of stay: March 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rossjamie
Riad Les Trois Mages,dogbox7 wrote a review Apr 2011,40,chilled...,The riad was clean breaky everyday was fresh scumptious croissants only had one main lunch here on the first day as we was to busy venturing out the pool terrace was fab especialy after the medina souks and as you're tired and dusty great shower in the twin room. The riad location is north and still within the old city but is still a 15-20 minute (without getting lost) walk through the souks to the main square to be in midst of things is mostly in the south of the old city or new town. the only thing is the Gaspard roomm is on the ground floor - i would next time share a double especially if you are a light sleeper and like a lay in.,Date of stay: April 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dogbox7

Riad Les Trois Mages,The3AmigosMarrakech wrote a review Mar 2011,40,A haven amongst the hustle and bustle of Marrakesh,I was a little anxious about arriving so late (11.30pm) at the airport and having to find my way to the riad but was greeted by the local taxi service (Hassan) organised by Aidan so arrived safe and sound to be greeted by the night guardian and my friends who had arrived earlier had settled in and had met the other guests over a home cooked traditional dinner - shame I missed it by all accounts.  The room was comfortable even with three of us in it and after a good night's sleep we tucked in to a yummy breakfast before heading out into the souks and exploring the various sights that start only a few minutes walk away. Aidan's a good guide and also has lots of ideas on itineraries (trips to the mountains/coast) and recommendations for food etc.  It's lovely to return to the piece and quiet of the riad when you're tired and dusty to cups of tea (traditional or mint) and being able to relax by the pool up on the terrace or in the sumptuous lounges and just chill out.  The staff are all very friendly and welcoming which made our stay all the more enjoyable.,Date of stay: March 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Marrakech,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The3AmigosMarrakech

The whole trip ticked every box weather and culture.    But the Riad Les Trois made the whole trip complete. I cannot express how wonderful it was. I have stayed in 5 star hotels to Blackpool B&B's and I can say quite confidently this was the best of them all. Aidan and the staff made us feel right at home.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Mummer52 wrote a review Mar 2011,50,Treated like Royality at the Riad of The Three Kings,Have just returned from our first trip to Marrakech we happened to arrive on the same day as the king of Morocco and the analogy stuck because we were thrilled with the royal reception at our little palace tucked away in the northern end of the Medina. Behind an unassuming brown door in unremarkable pink alley way we found ourselves in a beautiful haven with wonderful food stylish decor bowls of fresh roses everywhere a heated pool on the roof fantastically helpful staff and dozens of little touches that made us smile such as electric blankets and roaring log fires when the hot winter sun went down and a contant supply of complimentary mint tea and snacks on a silver tray when ever we felt inclined. The Riad is well located for the main attractions of Marrakech. It's a short walk north to the Marjorelle Gardens and south to the souks palaces and main square. Being first time visitors we particularly appreciated the great care and attention of the staff in helping us to plan excusions and nights out and in one case sending out a cheerful search party when I had clearly got lost. The atmosphere was very relaxed friendly and peaceful with only the odd bird swooping down into the courtyard or someone playing the baby grand in the music room to disturb the silence . The rooms are individually and lovingly furnished and a spare bed was added to our double room at no extra charge for my teenage daughter. We are already planning our next trip.,Date of stay: February 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mummer52

Riad Les Trois Mages,house321 wrote a review Feb 2011,50,Loved this Riad,Just arrived back from Riad Les Trois Mages and have to say its the best place I've ever stayed in. The staff are superb and eveyrthing was taken care of We were met at the airport by a driver who had been sent by the staff. It is only 20 minutes by car from the airport to the Riad.    We had a wonderful evening meal waiting for us the food was sumptous and beautifully presented    The 5 bedrooms are very tradtionally Morrocan and there are lots of places to relax within the Riad.    There is a lovely piano room with a Roland electric piano and guitars and other instruments for the musically minded and a wondeful lounge area where you can sit near the open fire in the evening take teaand read some of the numerous books that are available to guests.  .  Don;t miss the chance to have a day in the stunning Oureka Valley and trip to the waterfalls The excursion was arranged via the Riad at a reasonable price and our wonderful guide Ali was first class. and ensured that all our needs were met. We loved the visit to the traditional berber house in the valley and the camel rides.    The children loved the heated pool on the roof with the sun beds and the tented area were we took tea. We had a massage at Riad on the first day which was lovely.    We got lots of bargains in the Souk and enjoyed buying the local produce The bread fruit nuts dates and vegetables were all so fresh.

Riad Les Trois Mages,poisoniivy wrote a review Jan 2011,50,Everything you wanted in a Traditional Moroccan Stay,This was definitely a very beautiful Riyad situated in the Medina. The service was impeccable we could always get Mint tea made and snacks whenever we were hanging out in the courtyard. There is a piano and sheet music so I got to play a few things while we were chilling. They made reservations for us for dinner booked a day-trip for us to Essoueria and was just overall very accommodating. You can definitely bargain for the price if it's low season which was when we were traveling and also bargain for the day-trip prices if you find something cheaper. There is internet available and wireless if you need it. Breakfast is served every morning either in the courtyard or upstairs on the rooftop - wherever you want! If you want eggs you can also ask for it as well. That's why I love bed and breakfasts!    I traveled with my fiance and another couple and we really enjoyed ourselves here. If you want to stay in the Medina this is a great place to have a more traditional feel. If you want something more modern then try something outside the Medina. It was our first time in Africa so Morocco was a great first country to start with and the Riad Les Trois Mages was great value for money.,Date of stay: November 2010,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"San Francisco, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/poisoniivy

Riad Les Trois Mages,Mike_in_Oxford_UK wrote a review Dec 2010,40,"A wonderful, relaxing home in busy Marrakech",From our first dealings with Anna to meeting Aidan at the Riad every aspect was easy. The pick-up from the airport was welcome and the riad itself extremely comfortable and well-decorated. The food was very tasty and the menu extensive - it is worth eating there at least once. aid an and colleagues were full of good advice and provided contacts in other Moroccan cities. The surroundings were such that you can make friends with other guests and the pool although small was a welcome relief in summer!    The location is within the old city but is still a 15-20 minute walk through the souks to the main square which can be a problem if you want to be in the thick of things or if it is a very warm summer day. Also while the riad was very helpful in organising a guide the guide was more an observer in the maze of the souks rather than a help in bargaining. Indeed on a couple of occasions he encouraged that an offer was a good deal when we subsequently found that it wasn't. Still should have done our research and it is all part of the experience...    All in all a wonderful experience and we would not hesitate to stay there again.,Date of stay: July 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Oxford, UK",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mike_in_Oxford_UK
Riad Les Trois Mages,thelondonernw7 wrote a review Dec 2010,50,Outstanding!,We stayed in this Riad over a long weekend celebrating a significant birthday and a similarly important wedding anniversary. I could write a huge amount about this Riad but the simple version is that this is an excellent place and we were absolutely delighted with our stay. The actual building itself is wonderful; tastefully decorated to a very high standard and ideally positioned about 5 minutes walk away from the entry to the Souk. However the real selling point about this place is the people. Quite frankly nothing was too much trouble everything exceeded expectations and you got a real sense that they took a genuine personal interest in their guests. The card and flowers we got on the morning of our anniversary were an unexpected bonus and I imagine typical of the care that they take over the little things. The meal we enjoyed on our first night was outstanding and although we tried (very hard) we never found anything that was close in terms of quality and flavour - and what we ate elsewhere was very good. We will remeber our stay for many years to come.,Date of stay: December 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thelondonernw7

The riad is small quiet and charming with friendly and helpful staff excellent breakfasts home-cooked dinners which were probably better than most restaurants and lots of helpful advice from Aidan. The roof was a good place to be in the afternoons with a plunge pool which is perhaps a little too warm and plenty of shade.

We had originally tried to book one of their lovely double rooms but ended up in the Bahia suite which was a very beautiful mixture of modern meets traditional furnishings.    We arranged a guide around Marrakech and taxi driver through the riad both of whom we would recommend and nothing was too much trouble for the great staff here.

Riad Les Trois Mages,dcy00 wrote a review Sep 2010,50,well worth a visit,spent a couple of nights in this place last month and found it to be a wonderful riad. We had stayed at another riad earlier on in our trip which was distinctly average and were worried that this could be the same. This was dispelled immediately on our arrival as the manager Aidan and his team do everything to make sure you have a good stay. The meal on our first night was excellent with cooking to a very high standard the staff will always give you advice and help out where possible including guiding you to and from restaurants so that you don't get lost in the medina. The location of les trois mages is also good as it is away from the souks and the main square and is therefore in a more hassle-free area of the medina. The room was excellent and was also cleaned to a high standard. The roof terrace is lovely and the plunge pool very welcoming in the heat of the day.

Riad Les Trois Mages,ClovaTheWestie wrote a review Jul 2010,50,Wonderful Staff & Great Food!,We stayed at this Riad for 3 nights in JUly and really enjoyed our stay. Prior to leaving the UK we had arranged for an airport transfer and a meal for the evening of our arrival. Unfortunately Mr Ryanair had different ideas which led to us arriving 2 1/2 hours late. However the taxi transfer had remained at the airport to meet us the wonderful Mr. Ali who is one of the Riads regular drivers and he was was so helpful and pleasent and ensured that the journey to the Riad was stress-free. He gave us plenty of hints and tips for our stay in Marrakech on the way.  On arrival at the hotel the brilliant staff had managed to ensure that the food we had ordered for our meal was still really tasty although we were massively late. Throughout the 4 days we ate at the Riad on 3 occasions twice for dinner and once for lunch and on each occasion it was superb. It was far better than anything we had at other restaurants in town especially the kafta tagine with eggs.  The Riad itself is beautiful with lovely air conditioned public areas a beautiful courtyard and well maintained lovely decorated rooms with air conditioning which is a must at this time of year. Once the front door is closed the place is unbelievably peaceful.  It also has a very pleasent roof terrace with a canopied area and small plunge pool with plenty of sun loungers and towels supplied. Even here though the temperatures were very high so the free water and tea/coffee was very much appreciated.  The Riad also organised a day of excursions for us a morning tour of the Souk with a local guide Mr Mohammed and an afternoon to the Atlas Mountains with Mr Ali again. Both were excellent Mr Mohammed taking us to places we would otherwise never have seen or found within the Souk whereas Mr Ali once again excelled treating us like his family. He arranged a visit to A Berber families house and arranged for a guide to take us for a hike in the Ourika Valley.  If I had one very small criticism I would say that the Riad is on the wrong side of the Souk for my liking and was a bit of a walk back at night from where the action was.  Overall however highly recommended. I would say that the website pictures are a very good indication as to what to expect from this Riad.,Date of stay: July 2010,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Hamilton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClovaTheWestie

Riad Les Trois Mages,spartico71 wrote a review Jul 2010,50,Paradise is here!!,Riad Les Trois Mages was a delightful place to while away the hours after a busy day at the souks. Inside the Riad was an amazing atmosphere of calm and relaxation.  I enjoyed the gentle rhythms of the piano and the chirping of the visiting birds.  There were many books available to read and a selection of CDs  Having just finished my exams I decided to treat myself. I needed to declutter my brain from algorithms and equations. After my first day at the Riad my goal was achieved. I was in a blisful state of idleness and contentment.  The food was excellent and I found the staff to be more than helpful and very friendly.  I spent many hours relaxing by the pool and trying to forget I found a Ronan Keating CD in the CD collection. :-)  Overall; the Riad was excellent  the food was to die for the staff were amazing and I'm going back there next year!,Date of stay: May 2010,Trip type: Traveled solo,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spartico71
Riad Les Trois Mages,loubLondon wrote a review Jul 2010,30,"Calm and laid back, nothing too much trouble, but pricey for quality",As per previous reviews this riad is a calm haven from the chaos of the souks but is in a great location for exploring central Marrakech.  The service we had from the staff was fantastic very friendly and nothing too much trouble - booking excursions dinner reservations taxis lunch when we arrived etc.  However for the price we paid we felt the quality of the riad was not as up to date and luxurious as it could have been - could do with some updating.,Date of stay: June 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loubLondon
Riad Les Trois Mages,Tatiana2010016 wrote a review Jun 2010,50,Oasis of calm,We chose this accommodation from the list of many due to its location and because it looked impressive on the website photos. And the riad proved to be exactly what the web advertised and more.  The location is perfect because it's a very short walk to all the local sites.  The place is very tastefully decorated very clean spacious and airy. There are several lounges on different levels and everyone can find a place to relax on a sofa. Alternatively you can enjoy refreshing coolness of the pool.  Food is amazing - we tried breakfast and dinner and can only talk in superlative about the quality.  The staff are really friendly helpful and they made us feel at home from the first moment we got in. Ask any questions you have and they will all be answered and you will get advice and assistance if need be.  A couple of other things we found amusing. The beds were incredibly comfortable and there were birds entertaining guests by most pleasant singing!!!  Les Trois Mages is oasis of calm in anotherwise industrious and bustling Medina.  We will definitely return to this riad and would highly recommend to anyone looking for the complete Moroccan experience.

Riad Les Trois Mages,MrJonty wrote a review May 2010,50,Oasis of calm and great service,This riad was very good indeed; the staff were faultlessly polite and helpful doing anything they could to make our trip good. They even brought tea and cakes whenever we were peckish and didn't charge at all for this; large bottles of water are also free; one of the staff got up at 4 am to make us breakfast on our last day. The central courtyard is a scattering of tables and sofas some sheltered in alcoves and some open to the elements; the rooms are all individually decorated and spacious enough. The terrace had a small plunge pool and sunbeds and was a great place to unwind after a day in the hectic city. Only downside was it was difficult to get mobile reception due to the location but I guess this is the case all over the medina maybe. All in all a fabulous place.,Date of stay: May 2010,,Southampton,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrJonty

Riad Les Trois Mages,weaselz99 wrote a review Apr 2010,40,Great place to stay,Coming from the states directly to a location like Marrakech can be a bit intimidating. Just the vast amount of differences can make your head spin.  I had about 1000 questions and Aidan answered every single one of them with a smile on his face. We felt very safe and all of our events were planned through the riad.  They also helped us with train reservations as you cannot buy these outside of Morocco. (big life saver) The Riad is VERY clean and the meals served by the onsite cook(sidaya?) were outstanding!! The location in the medina makes it easy to get around well about as easy as it can be within the medina.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Caroline106 wrote a review Mar 2010,40,A welcome oasis from the hustle and bustle - book it soon!,"I booked Les Trois Mages after extensive research on the internet. I wanted a riad that could offer me and my partner a decent standard of accommodation within walking distance of all the main sights of Marrakech but I didn't want a riad that was so sleek and ""boutique"" that it didn't feel authentic. I'm so delighted that Les Trois lived up to my expectations. It's a smallish riad with a homely feel which is such a welcome relief after heat dust and bustle of Marrakech. It's run by Aidan who bends over backwards to ensure your stay is what you hope for and gives top tips on how to get the best from your trip. Saida the cook is fabulous and Moussin the night guardian is fantastic too. He even walked us right to the door of Le Foundouk restaraunt which we give 5 stars but is really hard to find on your own.    The rooms are very clean comfortable and perfect for a short break ( we stayed for 4 nights/5 days in total). The riad offers wi-fi and has a very sweet roof terrace with sun-loungers and a plunge pool. We got into the habit of sight-seeing in the morning eating lunch out and retreating to Les Trois for a siesta and a bit of sunbathing on the roof terrace during the afternoon before we headed out for our evening meal. Aidan will recommend where to eat (we weren't impressed with Cafe Arabe but Le Tanjia is excellent and so are their bellydancers and Le Foundouk was incredible for our last night). This was a perfect receipt for relaxation combined with culture!    The rooms aren't massive but why would anyone need a huge space when you have so much to see and do in Marrkech?? We stayed in both the Arabesque room and best of all the suite - the suite is my recommendation - pure delight.    The service is unassuming and efficient you get as much bottle water tea and coffee as you can manage here (and tea and coffee come with tasty cake or snacks yum!). I think Les Trois is perfect for people like us who are fairly accomplished independent travellers and while we like our home comforts we don't want to feel we're staying in some over-restored riad - Les Trois is the authentic article and so is the service.    I really can't find any fault and yes we would definitely visit again and have already recommended it to our friends.    Top tips for Marrkech - if you have a registered guide tell them upfront you don't want to be dragged into the stalls in the souks for a ""sales pitch""!  Don't ride in a caleche ride (horse-drawn carriage) unless it has a SPANA band on its hoof - this denotes animal welfare standards are being adhered to by the owner.  Spend half a day at Le Jardin Majorelle - it's beautiful and the cafe serves exotic drinks and lovely grub.

Riad Les Trois Mages,rufuslover wrote a review Mar 2010,50,The staff at Les Trois Mages helped to make our stay extra special.,"I am the sort of traveller who likes to research their holiday to the nth degree & after reading all the positive reviews of Les Trois Mages on Tripadvisor I would have to agree with all that has been said. Having arrived in the evening with our 2 children (8 & 12) we were taken safely by the taxi organized by Aidan through the haphazard traffic of Marrakech & delivered at the riad. Although we had not emailed a menu choice ahead a delicious meal awaited us in the lovely courtyard & Moushine & Saida made us feel immediately at home. We had reserved the large Bahia suite & two comfortable beds had been made for the children. We thought the decor of the suite was very tasteful the bathroom was very nice (particularly the toiletries) & it had a lovely view over the courtyard. During our stay the plastic cover remained over the courtyard (I think the previous week had been rainy) however we were in Marrakech for a week & saw no rain although a couple of evenings were a little chilly. The following day Aidan took us through the map & landmarks before walking us to the La Place (15 mins) to help us get our bearings but we thought the location was ideal- as other reviews have pointed out it is easy to find & far away from the centre of the Medina to be a peaceful haven. Our kids loved the heated rooftop pool where towels & sun hats were provided. It is a shame that there is not a view from the roof but the tented area was lovely to chill out & the staff were kind enough to bring mint tea & yummy homemade cakes up the 2 flights of stairs each day of our stay. The bed was reasonably comfortable-very firm -but I was woken by the call to prayer although the rest of the family slept through! The 2 meals that we ate in the riad were good (background music provided by the ""magic piano"") & the breakfasts were excellent with beautiful breads fresh fruit & good coffee. The fire in the sitting room was lit every night & a few other guests were regularly eating in the riad. The one night we did eat out at Le Foundouk (v. good) Moushine escorted us there & upon paying the bill we found him outside waiting to see us home again! Overall we were delighted with the Riad & would love to return to Les Trois Mages & that is down to the attention to detail & caring & friendly service provided by all the staff.",Date of stay: March 2010,Trip type: Traveled with family,Glasgow,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rufuslover
Riad Les Trois Mages,Leon London wrote a review Feb 2010,40,A haven in the hubbubb,I had been to Tangiers for the day so sort of knew what to expect but Marrakesh is much more frenetic. Even the very smart places in the old town are approached via rather scruffy streets and so it was with Trois Mages. When we first arrived we had to admit a slight sense of disappointment as it isn't as groomed and polished as it appears in the website photographs which make it look very glamorous. There are lovely touches in the furnishings and decor though  and it is a riad. However Aidan the manager and his Moroccan team soon made us feel at home and we really enjoyed our stay there. They will walk you to places if you are unsure book taxis and restaurants and arranged a lovely balloon trip. Aidan's restaurant suggestions are spot on. Although meals need to be booked they rustled up some supper when we arrived back frazzled after getting hopelessly lost and chilled our wine. Moshim the night watchman served us a lovely very early brakfast on two occasions. It is very much like staying in a family home with a retinue of staff to care for you. I would have liked just a touch more grooming but this is just my personal taste and experience. Would I recommend it or stay again.. most definitely yes!,Date of stay: February 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeonSouthLondon

Such a beautiful and intimate place with amazing staff and owners. The fresh food they made us for breakfasts and dinner was delicious. The lovely cool building was such a perfect and peaceful haven to return to after the craziness of the Souks (which were about a 15 minute walk or £2 taxi ride away). The pool and roof terrace were a lovely bonus and a great place to relax and enjoy the sun.

The roof terrace offered great pool side relaxation and we certainly would have taken our evening meal on the roof if we'd been there longer.  When I checked on the map I was a little worried by the apparent distance from the main square. But dont be put off it's a short and pleasant walk into the craziness.

Riad Les Trois Mages,FullofbeansBristol wrote a review Oct 2009,50,A beautiful home with lovely staff amid the madness of Marrakech,This was our first trip to Marrakech. It was a bit of a shock as we had never been to Morocco before. Everywhere there are small alleys full of people donkeys small carts small motor bikes bicycles water sellers and medicine men etc. The souk is full of colours smells of spices and new leather.    The staff of Les Trois Mages made our stay perfect. There was always support whether finding a nice place to eat or an unusual part of the Souk. Saida made us some wonderful Moroccan food. In fact we preferred to stay and eat at the riad. Some of the more western restaurants are quite expensive and actually worse than Saida's cooking. Our room was beautifully decorated. A lot of thought has been given to the decoration through out the riad.

Riad Les Trois Mages,MoonHazeDream wrote a review Sep 2009,50,Beautiful and welcoming....,Our stay at Riad Les Trois Mages was truly magical. We were looked after so well by Aiden and the beautiful cooks & staff. My husband flew me to Marrakesh for a surprise birthday gift. On the morning of my birthday Aiden presented a huge bunch of roses at my champagne breakfast. A gift from the hotel which was so sweet of them all. Aidan was an excellent host making us feel really at home showing us the route through the winding streets to the main square and souks plus attending to our every needs. He is extremely conscientious and has a good sense of humour. The owners are very lucky to have him working there as he is destined for much greater things!  The Riad is a slight hike from the main square (15mins+) situated in a back alley. The immediate route to this alley is somewhat dilapidated but as soon as you get to the lovely front door and step into the cool welcoming Riad a sense of calmness washes over.  Breakfast was the usual coffee (proper plunger coffee!) pancakes fruit salad toasts or whatever we wanted. Nothing was too much trouble to sort out.  The serene bedrooms were beautifully Tadelakt in the tradition style with soft warm colour choices and luscious bathrooms. A medium priced Riad with good choice of interior design that made it that bit special. What made the place was Aiden and the rest of the staff’s hospitality.  The only thing that would put us off staying there again in the future is the longish walk to the main square. After a long day and night walking for hours the walk back became a bit of a hike even though you could do it fast in 15 minutes. Although it was kind of nice as we met some lovely people on the way plus fed lots of stray cats who were grateful for the tins of mackerel. Patron Saint of the Moggie Kingdom that's me! Last time I was here I saved a cat and found it a home. We went to visit it after 10 years and was greeted by CousCous the cat lounging on the hallway chair! A nice retirement. Anyway I digress.... regarding getting back to the hotel at night.... You could always get a taxi to the alley by the hotel which would only cost a few £ but at the time we didn’t think to do that and I kind of liked the night time adventure even though my feet were killing me (and yes I was wearing sensible shoes!).  On my return home I open the book I had pressed all my beautiful birthday roses into and the scent of the petals filled the room bringing back the memories of our wonderful time in Marrakesh....  Thank you everyone at Les Trois Mages for making it that bit special and thank you my beautiful husband for some lovely memories... xxx,Date of stay: August 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,La Vienne,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MoonHazeDream
Riad Les Trois Mages,AussieTravellerUK wrote a review Jun 2009,50,Everything you could want from a Riad!,With so many riads available in Marrakech it took us a while to narrow down the choices but we found Les Trois Mages ticked all the boxes and was fabulous – great facilities (including rooftop terrace with pool and lovely rooms) brilliant staff (providing all the help we could need both in arranging our visit and while we were there) and good location (easy walk through the souks to the square).    The riad itself is relatively easy to find. Laura the Manager arranged a driver to take us from the airport to the riad and on arrival gave us a map and provided really useful directions making it almost impossible to get lost! The walk to the square though the souks is easy enough though you need to remember that motorbikes and donkeys have right of way. The food in the square is worth trying and Laura’s recommendations of bars around the medina (especially the Kosybar where you have views overlooking the medina and are eye level with the stork nests on the walls) were spot on.    The rooms at the riad are great – all en-suite and each with its own character. There’s also plenty of communal areas to relax in – downstairs there is a courtyard sitting room and music room and the roof top terrace is the perfect place to chill out with dinner and a few drinks. The pool itself is also bigger than the average plunge pool you tend to have in riads.    The staff helped make our experience in Marrakech and the riad itself exceptional. Laura provided us with so much advice and was helpful in arranging anything we needed including taxis drinks and day trips. Saida made us feel so welcome always on hand to provide anything we needed and cooking marvelous meals for us. Even after we left they were so helpful looking after our excess baggage while we spent 3 days hiking in the High Atlas Mountains and welcoming us back to shower and refresh before we travelled on to Fes.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Hugenot wrote a review May 2009,50,Fantastic riad,After trawling through loads of potential riads we settled on this one and we weren’t disappointed. Laura (the Manager) was extremely helpful and knowledgeable both in response to all our emails and when we arrived. It’s a good idea to ask the riad to arrange a driver to meet you from the airport as it’s difficult to find the first time. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and the meal Saida cooked for us on our last night was absolutely delicious – as good as any we ate out. Eating on the roof terrace just the two of us with its beautifully lit pool and sumptuous tent was magical.    We booked the Bahia suite which was gorgeous. The bath was a real treat and the sunken bed area was so comfortable. There are two lounges on the ground floor – one with a grand piano and various musical instruments and another with a dining table and comfy sofas. However as the weather was so hot we spent most of our lounging time up on the roof terrace.    The riad is located about 10 minutes walk from the Jemaa El Fna but the walk through the souks was very enjoyable and interesting. Once inside the riad’s heavy front door you are cocooned from the noise outside. Also bottled water tea and coffee are available free whenever you want it.    My tip is not to wear comfortable shoes but to wear THE most comfortable shoes you have EVER worn. Your feet will ache because you will definitely walk more than you plan and you need to be agile to dodge the scooters and taxis whizzing past you.    Would recommend a pre-dinner drink in the Kozy Bar followed by dinner in Le Tanjia (just around the corner from the bar). The band was excellent and the belly dancing display was fun – even if you don’t want to join in. Check out the beautiful central lamp hanging over the atrium.    We were very disappointed with the Menara Gardens (to the west of Marrakech) having taken a taxi ride there especially to take photos. Apparently you can only get pictures of the pavilion with the snow-capped Atlas Mountains behind at certain times of the year. The water in the pool looked filthy and the whole place seemed very tatty and nothing like the pictures we’d seen.    Thank you Laura and all the staff for a fabulous time.,Date of stay: May 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hugenot
Riad Les Trois Mages,Caz027 wrote a review May 2009,50,Simply Divine!!,"I have just got back from a fantastic trip to Marrakech with 2 friends of mine - we were taking our annual girly getaway & decided upon Morrocco - wanting to take in all of it's charms shopping & sights. After reading through reviews on Trip Advisor - our Riad had been decided upon...Les Trois Mages. Now I knew that it was good from what I had read but our stay there totally surpassed my expectations. The entire team of staff were so welcoming and friendly so much so we took to calling Saida (fabulous cook!!) ""Mamman"" as she really was quite literally like a mother figure! I cut my foot in one instance...and immediately she got changed into her traditional headscarf and dress and went out to get me some iodine. Then still not happy to leave me to fend for myself she applied it for me and then plastered my foot too! Quite literally the sweetest woman you will ever meet but in all fairness every single person there was fantastic!!  The Riad itself is relaxed elegantly furnished and an oasis of calm! You wouldn't think that just 5 mins away a hustling bustling souk is in full swing. The pool area up on the roof is a haven for the sun worshippers and if a bit of cool shade is more your thing there is a bedouin style tent up there provides that as does the outside seating area a floor down nestled above a courtyard - and as if that isn't enough there are two open parlours with comfy sofas a piano to play should you so wish or courtyard seating where you can sip a refreshing glass of mint tea!!  This place is a gem. It is simply flawless and provided us with the perfect accomodation to complement a perfect Marrakech getaway break!! :)",Date of stay: May 2009,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Suffolk, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Caz027
Riad Les Trois Mages,chrisb48 wrote a review May 2009,50,A beautifully quiet relaxing well managed oasis in the madness that is Marrakech,First visit to Marrakech after many years thinking about it. Choosing a Riad is a daunting task with so many to choose from and at such a huge range of prices so our arrival at Les Trois Mages was in some ways an amazingly lucky accident. From the prompt a friendly meeting at the airport (Hakim) to our departure 5 days later Les Trois Mages was faultless. Laura the host/manager is delightful/knowledgeable/efficient/calm and tends to your needs in an effortless unflustered way whilst Saida the eversmiling cook rustles up great varied breakfasts of breads pancakes yoghurts eggs (anyway you want!). Do eat in the evening at the Riad at least once where Saida's food was as good as(if not better) than the much more expensive restaurants we visited. Nothing was too much for the staff whilst it was really a home from home with the use of the kitchen to prepare a couple of our own light lunches from supplies bought at a nearby supermarket. The location of the Riad was typically Marakhian down a narrow passage off a main road in the Medina but only 10 mins walk to the Jemaa el Fna and closer to the Medersa and the Musee de Marrakech and just north of the amazing souks. Apart from the calls of the Muezzins (and you can't escape them even at 4am) Les Trois Mages was great for a peaceful sleep with no traffic noise. A day trip to the Atlas mountains and the Ourika valley also with Hakim was another highlight and a real break from the noise smoke and chaos of the Medina. Finally a real big thanks to Hassim(I hope I've got his name correct) the night porter/caretaker who not only escorted us to a difficult to find restaurant on our last night then was waiting to escort us back as we left it  then got our breakfast ready at 6am so we could catch our early flight. I cannot understand how this ranks in the 70's for Marrakech it would be our No 1 recommendation,Date of stay: May 2009,Trip type: Traveled with family,Birmingham uk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisb48
Riad Les Trois Mages,Porscheboy wrote a review May 2009,50,I DONT want to write this report,Beacause I want to keep this place all to MYSELF!! Its one of the best places I've ever stayed with the nicest and most capable staff ever. My wife says I have to write a report so here goes!!  We booked through Hipmarrakech very efficient and very honest in all dealings with them.  We arrived at the airport and were met by the Riad's chosen taxi driver and taken straight to the Riad which is located in the North Western part of the Medina.  The Riad manager Laura was there to greet us and Laura proved to be a font of sensible information on the area. We had read much about the now legendary Saida the Riad's Chef and chose to eat at the riad every night(we stayed 5 nights). This proved to be a good choice because the dinner served each night was superb. I even asked Saida to cook one of my favorite dishes from Alsace in France and the result was the most delicious Poulet au Reisling I have had for a long time. The general housekeeping was of a high standard. There was always hot water and fresh towels.  We met some super people staying there at the same time as us and the riad turned into a large houseparty. Great fun.  If you are thinking of visiting Marocco then do your homework. Its not for everyone. I noticed in many reports people moaning about aggressive shopkeepers people in the square putting snakes and monkeys on you to then demanding money for pictures. This is easily avoidable just smile and say NON to the shopkeepers and dont go near the snake charmers and monkey handlers. Its quite simple really!!  To finish--if you want your senses assaulted (in a nice way) with noise aromas colors and many fascinating people then go---But I'd really rather you did'nt beacause its MINE!!!!,Date of stay: March 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Porscheboy

Riad Les Trois Mages,CheapskateStNeots wrote a review Mar 2009,50,Excellent value and great service,Visiting Marrakesh for the first time can make you feel a bit edgy. Booking a place to stay even more nervy. The walk to Les Trois Mages is part of what Marrakesh Medina is all about. Through the door to a marvellous Tardis that Dr Who would be proud of. Simple and effective is how I sum it up. Folks that want more need to spend more and keep out of the Medina. The rooms have character and live up to a Morrocan Riad in my view. The food and service from the team and the chief cook Siada was great. The small courtyard makes it all feel like a secluded oasis in a completely secure environment. The effect is one that makes you feel like you are part of a 'family'. The Riad has no alcohol license but a word in the right ear and you can bring in a bottle of wine. Tip: Laura the manager is partial to chocolate from the UK!!  The arrangements to collect and return to the aiport all worked without a hitch. What more can be said other than a great place to stay within the walls of the Medina. My wife and I loved it. I am trying hard to think of a downside and cannot.

Riad Les Trois Mages,LouiseB82 wrote a review Mar 2009,50,Fantastic Riad - amazing service and value!,"We booked this Riad for a 5 night stay at the beginning on March - we were very impressed with the rate quoted - a lot cheaper than other local Riads. Cheaper doesn't mean you compromise on the standard of accommodation or service though - the decoration was beautiful our room was very comfortable and the service was top notch - nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff. Breakfast was delicious (and filling!) every morning and there was such a lovely laid-back vibe to the place - you could help yourself to bottled water from the fridge and you could curl up in one of the living areas with a good book and be bought complementary mint tea (and even freshly made cakes/pastries!) which was a gorgeous escape from the madness that is the souk!    Dinner was fantastic and such good value - unless you're eating in cafes or the main square itself the restaurants are extortionate! The price we paid for three amazingly cooked courses with a bottle of wine was extremley good value and it was such a lovely setting it was as nice (if not nicer) as the restaurants we did visit. Special mention has to go to Saida the cook - not only did she provide fantastic food but she was so friendly - nothing was too much trouble and it was great trying to communicate in pigeon French!    Laura the Riad Manager was really helpful both before and during our stay - she helped us arrange some fantastic excursions including a 4x4 trip into the Atlas Mounains and the guide she booked to take us around the city on our first day was really informative helpful and very useful in a city where it's very easy to get lost!    As the riad didn't have its own hammam Laura arranged treatments for us as the gorgeous ""Les Bains de Marrakech"" - it was all booked for us and was very starightforward and was a lovely experience.    All in all we had a fantastic stay - Marrakech itself is a wonderful experience but one that can be daunting and exhausting - having such a lovely base to come back and relax in really made our holiday.    OK the location was a little bit further out but not more than a 15 minute walk into the Souks and the centre!",Date of stay: March 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Cheltenham,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LouiseB82
Riad Les Trois Mages,Aussie_Migrant wrote a review Feb 2009,40,"Beautiful Riad, Amazing staff and a pretty good location",We really liked our stay here. The cost seemed a lot to us after our other travels but Morocco isn't that cheap so maybe it was actually good value. We paid €85 a night from memory for the Arabella room.  The most special features are the staff and the decor. The Moroccan lady who runs the kitchen is so sweet and with our garbled French skills we could manage to have a nice conversation. Aidan who worked on the reservation/front desk was really personable and great. He took us for a walk to the big square so we could find our way back. Aidan also has a wonderful and great value flat of his own in Essaouira which I highly recommend staying in if you can.  The room was nicely decorated and once heated properly was very cosy. The bathroom did have a funny smell but I think it was damp that caused it. I think this is common in a Riad in Winter so I am probably wrong to complain but I didn't love the smell:)  The food was yummy and the games/books downstairs were a nice touch. This would be a nice romantic as well as fun holiday place to stay. We didn't use the roof/pool to its full capacity and recommend you do.,Date of stay: January 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aussie_Migrant
Riad Les Trois Mages,Isaferrand wrote a review Feb 2009,50,Heaven on earth,"I stayed at les Trois Mages in January and fell in love with its charm and tranquility. To be within 15 mn from the main square yet feel like you are miles away from any civilisation is quite extroardinary. The peace within the riad is really enjoyable. The decor is so typically Maroccan that you feel like you are on the set of the ""thousand and one night"" film.  The staff was very welcoming and the main chef Saida is extraordinary. There is nothing that she cannot do. You tell her what you fancy eating (from the menu and sometimes outside of the menu)\and she does her utmost to make it for you.    The room itself was very comfortable and very warm despite the cooler temperate expected in January. Overall an excellent stay and I will definitely recommend to friends family and come back myself.    I would recommend that you check out this place urgently: it's just grand!",Date of stay: January 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Isaferrand

Riad Les Trois Mages,Super6one wrote a review Jan 2009,50,"Superb Value, Superb Riad",Me and my girlfriend stayed in Marrakech for nine nights four in the Les Trois Mages and five at the Riad El Fenn. Although the Riad El Fenn is a truly wonderful experience and the service their was excellent it is put in the shade by a place like this when you consider what you get and what you pay for.    We had two nights in the wonderfull Bahia suite that features one of the best beds I have slepted in.  The last night was spent in the smaller but still nice Jade room.  From the moment we arrived we were made to feel like it was our home and quickly felt very at ease in our surroundings something that took considerably longer at the Riad El Fenn.  The first meal I had in the Riad was also the best meal I had the whole trip a meatball Tagine that I could have ate every night until I left.    As for the roof terrace I was amazed to read some of the reviews saying that it was shabby. Please take it from me that this was written by someone who has had nothing else to compare it too. It is a lovely little corner of tranquillity with a small heated pool several sun loungers and a small shaded area to hide from the sun. Definately a highlight of the Riad.    We spent a lot of time investigating Riads before we booked and like to think we made the right choice in Les Trios Mages. Marrakech can be quite intimidating at first but having a place like this to come back to makes the city easier to settle into.    All in all this is a superb little Riad and I would like to thank Aidan and the team for all the hard work and advice given to us during our stay. Anyone visiting Marrakech for the first time should stay here to experience the true Riad experience as this is really all you could hope for. It is certainly different from staying in a hotel as you really feel like you are staying in a big house with a great host rather than paying for a room. Places like this proves the point that price does not always reflect quality!,Date of stay: December 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Edinburgh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Super6one
Riad Les Trois Mages,yankeetexan1 wrote a review Dec 2008,50,High Praise for Les Trois Mages,This Riad should be ranked in the top 10 on the Trip Advisor. It is positively charming has a wonderful staff and management is comfortable and provides fabulous breakfasts (including eggs if we wanted them). It's located in a very convenient part of the Medina and very affordable. In fact we stayed in another Riad during our trip to Marrakech which IS ranked in the top 10 and the Les Trois Mages stands heads and shoulders above the former.    More specifics: Aidan who was standing in for Laura (out on maternity leave) was helpful and informative across the board (restaurants local sites guides etc.) and he also hooked us up with two great drivers for two different day trips to Essaouria and the Atlas Mountains. We later learned (by staying in subsequent Riads) that the recommendations at the LTM for excursions were probably better-priced for the same type of excursions.    Moushine (sorry for misspellings) the Night Guardian is a gracious kind cheerful soul who was tireless in making sure we were well taken care of for coffee internet access anything else we needed. He also showed us the way to restaurants at night by walking us. The other three staff members including Saida were equally kind and gracioius. Bottled water the best coffee in Marrakech and tea were available compliments of the house any time day or evening which we discovered was unusual and therefore all the more appreciated. Whoever decorated this Riad has an eye for charm and style (to which website photos do not do justice). Overall the staff was outstanding and made us feel very welcome and cared for during the four nights we were there. In short excellent value and a great place to stay in Marrakech.,Date of stay: November 2008,,Washington DC,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yankeetexan1
Riad Les Trois Mages,Rob_and_Rose_8 wrote a review Dec 2008,50,Our second home!,Well what a delightful time we have just had in this endlessly fascinating but bonkers city! Made all the more lovely by the divine hospitality of the staff at Les Trois Mages.    From being picked up at the airport we were quickly transported into another world in the Medina and after a short walk were greeted at the riad by Aidan with the obligatory mint tea. (Made with fresh mint and green tea and poured from a great height)    Aidan was immensely helpful in organising our trip to the Atlas Mountains (top recommendation) a restaurant a massage and various taxis. We really appreciated his insight and guidance on these as well as which was the best wine to quaff. We were only a little disappointed that he had to stop pouring it for us and go to bed...ha ha.    The riad is extremely clean and comfortable and we were thrilled with the legendary Saida's home cooking and sense of fun. (It's great fun communicating in pigeon French and English.) We had the foresight to book lunch for our arrival which was taken on the sunny terrace. Then later dinner in the cosy furnished firelight of the salon.  Breakfast was varied and tasty too every day...perfect!    Finally not forgetting the night porter who looked after us too tending the fire leading us to our tour pick-up point and also making us the 'special' warming mint tea one chilly evening. (Doesn't involve alcohol you'll have to find out for yourself!)

Riad Les Trois Mages,seawolfPoulton_Lancs wrote a review Oct 2008,50,"Great Riad, Super Food, too!",Just returned home after a three night stay at Riad Les Trois Mages and feel compelled to recommend this wonderful place to others. The city is a complete assault on your senses and can leave you feeling drained so the RLTM's peace & calm is the perfect antidote to the 'chaos' outside. Aiden Saida a & all the staff are hospitable to a fault and genuinely cannot do enough for you. In fact we felt more like welcome house guests than residents. The rooms are wonderfuly furnished and really do add a touch of luxury to Marrakesh after a tiring day in the heart of a vibrant city. Finally we tried several of the 'highly recommended' resteraunts from our guide book and indeed (generally) were left distinctly underwhelmed by the quality of most of the food out side the Riad. However our best meal (by far) was the beautiful Morrocan food that Saida prepared for us on the Riad's roof top terrace!,Date of stay: October 2008,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Poulton, Lancs",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seawolfPoulton_Lancs

Nothing was too much trouble from booking restaurants to our many requsts for the amazing tea.  The rooms are stunning and impeccably looked after. Each evening after a hectic day out in the city we were welcomed back by Saida  nothing was every too much trouble.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Unique_Vee wrote a review Aug 2008,50,Perfect relaxing location,I returned from Marrakech and Les Trois Mages on Monday 25th August and am writing this review just 2 days later and I wish I could be back there!    My husband and I spent 3 nights there having spent the previous 5 in Essaouira if we had known how wonderful this riad was to prove to be we would have managed the balance of days the other way around especially as we did not get the weather we hoped for in Essaouira and the Riad we stayed in there was nowhere near the standard of Les 3 Mages.    I have visited Morocco many times over the last 15 years and this has to be the best accomodation I have stayed in.  It is beyond me why anyone staying here would give the any less than full marks in all aspects.    The place is spotless maintained to a good standard by a group of wonderful staff headed up by Laura the UK manager who is fantastic and managed to keep her cool despite the heat and being 6 months preganant (no mean feat in itself).    We were made welcome from the moment we stepped through the door to the taxi arriving to take us to the airport.    The local information provided by Laura when we arrived was helpful to us and would provide invaluable to a traveller new to Marrakech. Laura also arranged a local guide for a half day for us (at 400 dirhams) which helped immensely with navigating our way through the historic sites that are largely unsigned. I would however advise that you explore the Souks on your own the guide will get commission on all your purchases and only takes you where he wants to go!    We did not eat in the Riad as we only had 3 nights but the smell of cooking food on the second night was wonderful and very tempting. if we had stayed longer we most certainly would have partaken.    The roof terrace is a joy (and anyone saying it looks tired is not comparing with similar in Morocco where the elements simply take their toll very fast on outdoor spaces). The air con in the room was greatly appreciated and unusual for Morocco the drainage in the bathroom was adequate and so it did not smell like something had died in the ensuite shower room.    It is not a case of if we go back to Morocco but more a case of when and when we do we will certainly be staying here again. A wonderful stay.    NB: If you are considering visiting Morocco and have not been before it is worth remembering that it is still only a developing country and there is a high level of poverty. This is not the Med you will be walking down dusty dirty streets that don't suit stilletoes and white silk summer dresses. It is also a Muslim country that does not have 45 bars on every street alcohol can be obtained but not as readily as it is at home and it is comparatively expensive. If you want a boutiquey or a boozey style holiday you are best advised to choose somewhere else and leave Morocco to those holiday makers who want to respectfully experience a culture vastly different to their own and yet still only a few hours away by plane. If that sounds like you I'm sure you will have an amazing time!,Date of stay: August 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leeds, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Unique_Vee

Riad Les Trois Mages,LittleToot wrote a review Aug 2008,50,Rested Legs,"We had two separate nights here at the beginning of August. On both occasions we were more than completely satisfied. In fact I would say this is the best place we have ever stayed partly because the riad experience itself is so unique.  The manager/s were both very knowledgeable about Marrakech and gave sound and useful advice on how to make the most of the city for what was actually a very short stay. They arranged everything from airport pick ups to buying train tickets (something which can only be bought from the train station itself so if you want fist class this is the best way to do it) They greeted us on both occasions offering coffee and pastries while they talked to us about our travels or needs.  The room itself was lovely. We stayed in ""Melchior"". It was on two levels with a bed surrounded by light curtains. Very chic and romantic. The bathroom was clean and well appointed. Towels and bath robes were on the back of the door.  Breakfast was simple but ample especially the berber pancakes with honey which we both loved.  On our second stay we were the only guests so had the lovely roof terrace to ourselves which allowed the indulgence that we actually lived the lifestyle ourselves!  In short nothing is too much for the staff at LTM. They are proud of their Riad even offering peeks into other empty rooms to see that everwhere is sumptious.  At the end of the night our return was awaited and tea offered.

I feel that she is was one of the biggest assets the riad had and now have sadly lost.    The rooms were lovely and clean and decorated very well however it semed odd that the bathmats were bought from IKEA!!!!???? The terrace needs an urgent overhaul - a repaint and the tent has seen far better days.

Riad Les Trois Mages,ragdan wrote a review Jun 2008,20,Gutted,The lay-out and interior of this riad is great and the staff are friendly. However I did not enjoy my stay here mainly due to the other guests who were loud obnoxious and threatned violence! Not the fault of the riad but I felt they did very little to control the situation. We were kept awake on the first night by the other guests who were drinking directly below our room. They were not told to keep the noise down and at 2am I had to ask them myself at which point one of them turned nasty. The gentleman working at the riad did nothing to control the situation told me to go back up to bed and the guests continued until 3am. Basically I didn't feel safe here and able to enjoy my stay and for the price we paid I'd have expected much more. I wanted to leave after the first night but they were more concerned about us paying in advance which I was also surprised with as I have never paid in advance whether it be a hotel riad or B&B.

Riad Les Trois Mages,Well_travelled_Chris wrote a review May 2008,50,Relaxing & friendly,Stayed in Les Trois Mages for 3 nights in mid April '08 having booked through www.hipmorocco.com.    Very soon after we booked we received a friendly email from Helen giving us some background info organising the airport pickup (which I'd recommend for ease).    The riad itself is pretty with a great roof terrace. If you are looking for somewhere to relax and sunbath in the medina this is perfect - as well as a (little) pool there are around 10 sunbeds and its pretty quiet (calls to prayer not withstanding!).    Helen is very friendly and efficient - giving a good introduction when we arrived with recommendations for eating etc. She booked us a restuarant for our first night which was probably our best meal of the holiday (and my wife and I are quite foody). Another restaurant recommendation the next day was also excellent.    The staff are friendly and always willing to make you tea/coffee etc (for free) you can get free bottled water 24hrs a day. The food at the riad was OK but not that exciting - a fairly unadventurous mostly non-Moroccan menu. Breakfast was nice though and they are flexible as to where you have it (on the terrace or in the courtyard or elsewhere).    Location wise its about a ten minute stroll to the Djemaa-al-Fna -and less to the main souks. Its in a pretty good place.    We stayed in Bathazar which was nice - hot water always available in the reasonably powerful shower. Clean and spacious. We saw inside some of the other rooms and they were all nice.    Overall I'd really recommend this riad particularly as it costs a bit less than others of similar quality. We stayed elsewhere during our time in Morocco and this was the best riad we used.,Date of stay: April 2008,,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Well_travelled_Chris
Riad Les Trois Mages,AlexK_W9 wrote a review May 2008,50,Les Trois Mages is a legend....,This place is quickly becoming a legend. In the midst of the heat of the Medina Les Trois Mages offers the traveller a cool sanctuary in which to unwind and refresh. My arrival couldnt be any simpler. On arrival Hassan (cabby) was there to take me from the airport and within 15 minutes we had passed through a northern gate of the Medina Bab Moussoufa and onto the busy one way lane of Rue El Gza. The Riad is a short 5 minute walk from this Northern point and as I was to find in an excellent position for exploring both the central Medina Jemaa El Fna as well as for walking into the more newly developed surrounds outside of the ancient walled city.    When I arrived Helen was there to begin my initiation into the city. What sets her guidance apart from the rest is Helens obvious deep understanding of the place and the people and also her appreciation of my excitement at being here. Helens guidance and presence throughout my week long stay at the Riad was to prove invaluable. She oozes confidence and an explicit trust that Marrakech and its people will welcome the traveller; and so they do.....    The Riad itself is an oasis of calm elegance smart and clean. Its an ongoing work which is growing organically with the nurturance of its excellent staff team and its owners Tony and Anna. Nothing is too much trouble for these guys and their welcome feels like you've come home.    When I arrived I was unable to get a strong enough wifi signal to work on my laptop. Helen offered me use of the admin system at the Riad and within the day Tony arranged for an IT engineer and an electrician to install an extension to their system which was an instant solution which remedied the situation. The Riad offers excellent wifi internet access. Thus I was able to work unhindered.    The food at Les Trois Mages is becoming legendary. Saida's cooking is some of the best in the Medina and even though my french and arabic are dreadful negotiating my way around this menu with Saida was great fun. Each dish is individually prepared at your request and offers excellent value for money; aswell as giving a sound introduction to traditional Morroccan cuisine.    As the weather was between 37c - 40c the roof terrace and its pool meant that I could chill-out and cool right down as the summer sun began to dominate the Marrakchi skies. In the warm of the night the whole place is beautifully lit by traditional brass lamps studded with coloured glass.    Helens recommendations of where to eat and drink and what to see and experience outside of the comfort of the Riad were tried and tested by visitors before. Amongst them Cafe Arab (one of my most favourite haunts) an arabic fusion cafe with a tented terrace. Here a gently cooling mist is released from the shading canopy creating an easy chillout space where you can listen to ambient music and drink home-grown Casablanca beer by the bottle. The staff too are welcoming and I soon felt like I belonged.    So too was the Kosy Bar in the south of the Medina. Here you can watch the Storks come to rest for the evening in their huge nests upon the old city walls. As the sun sinks and the evening cools you can listen to impromptu performances from jazz musicians who seem to be simply passing through. The food here is good. It is a fusion of Morroccan-French with Japanese touch. Try the Poulet Terryaki - sound! Tip these guys well here it makes your next visit all the more pleasurable....    The Riad Les Trois Mages is a difficult place to leave (see the visitors book and the visitor who stayed within the walls of the Riad for 4 days!!!). The staff here become like family and the place has the feeling of a home from home. This place and its characters Helen Saida Tony Anna and the crew are becoming legend. Just awesome!!!,Date of stay: April 2008,Trip type: Traveled solo,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexK_W9
Riad Les Trois Mages,jamesboris wrote a review Apr 2008,50,stunning central and wonderful staff,what a wonderful stay we had here. the staff could not have been more helpful saida was a great cook and helen who manages the riad was the best host we had during our whole trip around morocco including arranging for us to be picked up by a very friendly and trustworthy taxi driver from the airport ( i would recommend doing this ). she sat us down when we arrived and talked us through a map of marrakech and suggested some fantastic places to visit and eat and drink. without this help we would have got very lost and wasted lots of time trying to find out where to go as marrakech can be quite daunting on your first visit. with helen's advice and help we breezed through our first day there and there could be no better place to go back to than this very central (only about a 15 minute walk through the bussling streets to the main medina) yet incredibly peaceful retreat with a gorgeous roof top pool .    we would recommend this to everyone and already have to our friends. we will certainly be returning and hope you enjoy your trip to morocco as much as we did. we would also recommend a trip to the atlas mountains.,Date of stay: April 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,london,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesboris
Riad Les Trois Mages,hextablelife wrote a review Apr 2008,50,Gorgeous!!,"We stayed at Les Trois Mages for three nights 1st - 3rd April and can't praise it highly enough. Never having been to Marrakech we too pored over the internet before choosing. We almost decided on the Jardins de Koutoubia (a 5* hotel within the medina) but were SO pleased we changed our minds. We went there for a drink and it was big impersonal and the service was poor. (We asked for a branded spirit and got 'petrol' when we complained - they admitted it wasn't what we'd ordered and even tho' we didn't drink it it remained on the bill. A glass of water was accidentally smashed and altho' the waiter saw it happen he left us sitting with broken shards around our feet and on the path near the pool for half an hour.. but I digress)  The Mages is really lovely and clean and best of all friendly. I fail to understand how anyone can critisise Helen (the manageress) I have honestly never met anyone so helpful. She sat with us for ages on the morning of our arrival gave us maps detailing the best restaurants bars etc and giving us invaluable information about what to do and more importantly what not to do. It all turned out to be spot on. She steered us expertly round what can be a fairly overwhelming city. She was there every day and asked for feed-back on what we'd done the day before. we were very curious about many aspects of life in Morocco not related to our stay and Helen has lived in Marrakech for a number of years and knows so much about the customs and culture. She came out of the kitchen when we left and gave us all a kiss and a hug. Maybe you get out of people what you put in - anyway I can't thank her enough. ALL the staff are sweet and Saida is a smashing cook a very friendly lady who makes an enormous effort to converse even tho' our French is very amateurish and her English is scant.    Don't be put off by the street outside the Riad. The medina is ancient and the footprint can't be changed. The houses are all inward facing around central courtyards making the outside facades quite featureless which means you set off down narrow alley-ways thinking ""What have I done? It's like Beirut ! I could have been in a hotel"" but stick with it. When you open the front door into the Riad it's a different world. Fresh flowers beautiful decor and friendly faces and a much more authentic intimate experience. One word of warning - mind out for mopeds - they're flippin' lethal. Walk on the right single file!  High lights for us were the Cafe Arrabe (lovely lunch venue) Le Comptoir Nightclub and the Kosy Bar where we were blown away by the sight of the storks nesting on the walls of the Palais Bahia. (Our Riad roof-top guitar recital was a blast too - apologies to the other guests especially B & R)    Overall it was a marvellous few days and Les Trios Mages was the perfect place to stay.",Date of stay: April 2008,Trip type: Traveled with family,kent,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hextablelife
Riad Les Trois Mages,piscesgroove wrote a review Apr 2008,40,A fabulous corner of the medina,We have just returned from a week long stay in Morocco of which we spent 4 nights in Marrakech at the Trois Mages.    Firstly the place was lovely clean fresh and very quiet. The decor is lovely (although I do agree about the hard mattress) the rooms are very comfortable and best of all the plumbing (which can be a problem over there) was fantastic powerful hot showers at any time.    The staff were great Sadia the two women who work with her and the night manager were all lovely. Although I disagree with what was said about Helen the manager I can understand a little bit.    She was fantastic with us the morning after we arrived she sat down and took the time to go through a great map she provided showed us in detail how to get to the centre and where to avoid (a result of which was we never got lost once the whole time) she recommended dinner at Tangia and Le Comptoir and made the bookings for us (both of which were excellent - I would especially recommend comptoir the food was fantastic and the decor is very buddha bar fabulous - although the belly dancers are a bit cliched). Anyway that was our first morning and she was friendly and helpful any time we saw her after that although she isn't there much. However on our last morning I overheard her being extremely rude to Sadia regarding cleaning which I thought was a bit much and when we left although she was standing in the kitchen she ignored us when we called goodbyes...but maybe she was just having a bad day so it's a small thing and the positives far outweighed that. Also we used Hassan's company to take us to Essaouira and on the return journey a few days later he was very helpful the driver was great and the price was €80 each way split between 6 people it's a 3 hour drive so I didn't think that was too expensive and was nice to know we could rely on the service.    I loved staying in the old Medina where the Riad is you don't get hassled at all and get to see the real people and life of Marrakech I had been worried that it was a bit far from the centre but it's only a short walk and the sights and sounds you see on the way make it seem like only seconds.,Date of stay: March 2008,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/piscesgroove
Riad Les Trois Mages,scoop2186 wrote a review Mar 2008,40,A very personal service,Dear Reader.... I was very surprised to hear of any negative comments made about Helen the Manager of this Riad. I was fully intending to write a review on Trip Advisor shortly after my return to the UK but things slipped for a number of reasons and I didn't do it. However having seen the comments logged here on 20th March I was motivated to jump to Helen's defence without hesitation.    Personally thanks to Helen I felt I had become a minor expert on Marrakech in the short time I was there. If I had not had her guidance I simply would not have got all that I did from my experience of Marrakech. I remain forever grateful to Helen for help help in making my few days as brilliant as they were.    Rather than being criticised I think the owners of the Riad are very lucky to have Helen and if a medal was available then she should be rewarded and recognised with it for her enthusiasm energy honesty and integrity (can the owners please organise the medal?!). In all my years of travel it has been rare to meet someone who was so easy to approach trust and depend upon for good solid advice (which I urge you to stick to 100%) and who actually listened carefully to feedback clearly with the full intention to pass any benefit to other travelers.    Best wishes Helen to you and your brilliant warm and friendly team (everything in previous reviews about Sadia's food was true!). I hope to return one day (assuming you are still there of course!).    To anyone still reading this review - I spent hour upon hour scanning just about every Riad on here many times before my trip and can advise that I did very well for myself and you couldn't be in wiser or safer hands. Visit Marrakech which can be overwhelming but be sure to pick the right Riad - this one!    By the way - the cost of Taxi's can vary depending on the size you use. Petit Taxi's are cheap as long as you are carrying nothing more than a small rucksack as your luggage! The cost of guides to the Mountains also vary depending on the quality of the vehicle the number of people travelling for the day and the experience of your guide. The trip organised for us by Helen was the highlight of my trip and worth every Dirham. I saw others during the day who were clearly not as comfortable or catered for as well as I was. You get what you pay for if you get good advice and take it is the point I am making.    Please feel free to contact me if you would like to verify anything I have commented on.,Date of stay: February 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Witham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scoop2186
Riad Les Trois Mages,pete stoneman wrote a review Jan 2008,40,"Very good english owned Riad, great service and management.",Lovely staff and very efficient and helpful english management.  Smart decor throughout and lovely bathrooms with very good plumbing !  Breakfast on the sun terrace is a perfect way to start your day or a lovely spot to get some sun.  Quiet location but close enough to main square to not be too hard on the feet when sight seeing.  Helen ( the South African manageress ) was most helpful with her insight and advice.  For a first time visit to Marrakesh this hotel is an ideal place.,Date of stay: January 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,caterham surrey uk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/petestoneman
Riad Les Trois Mages,Llandudnoite wrote a review Dec 2007,50,Unforgettable Experience,We arrived in Marrakech booked into a small hotel in the new town for the first night and the next day made enquiries as to where we could stay in the old medina. We were given the contact details of Sarah the new manager of Riad Les Trois Mages contacted her and were fortunate to find a room at the last minute. We have read one of the previous negative reviews and felt obliged to write about our great experience. As we understand the riad has new owners and they have done much to improve the riad. We were treated like VIPs our room exceptionally clean and beautifully decorated and the staff could not do enough to make us feel at home. We had great weather which allowed us to enjoy the pool on the roof terrace. The cooking of Saida was scrumptious. Sarah gave us information of what to see and places to go and we particularly enjoyed our day trip to the HIgh Atlas Mountain. Our sincere thanks to the staff of Riad Les Trois Mages for a magic holiday in Marrakech.,Date of stay: November 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"CPT, South Africa",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Llandudnoite
