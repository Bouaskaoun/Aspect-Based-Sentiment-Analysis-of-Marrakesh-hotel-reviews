From the moment we stepped behind the door an oasis opened up to us surrounding a lovely heated pool. The hotel staff were exceptional in every way polite attentive and so very helpful always happy to please. Nothing was too much trouble.

Then the pre arranged text came for 50 local currency to the train station which according to the locals is the maximum one should pay for any places around Marrakech. One the way walking to the taxi the gentleman (not Abdel) working at the reception desk instructed me to pay 60 10 more than the pre agreed maximum cost.    These are not issues about money. It is the trust lost and feel being treated like a stupid ATM.

They had no appt for us on the day and we had to split our Hammam treatment and massages on separate days. This was quite annoying as it restricted our schedule for two days instead of one. Also the walking tour arranged by the concierge was basically a shopping expedition  of the Medina. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend booking your city tours through them.  Location: in a quiet section on th e edge of the Medina so beware it is a good 20 min walk to the main square. It is convenient to go to other areas of the city since there is easy access out of the medina.

Les Jardins de la Medina,El K wrote a review Oct 2022,50,Wonderful!,Gorgeous setting professional and friendly staff amazing city!  This hotel is situated on a quiet road 20 mins walk to the central square and 5 mins from lovely restaurants.  The staff deserve the first mention. From the welcoming staff to the waiting staff to the cleaners everyone was so professional. Many spoke to us in English and French but a number took time to teach me a little Arabic when I asked too which was nice.  The road into the centre is busy with motorbikes cars and pedestrians and I wouldn't recommend to go with children or r travel by taxi if you do.  I'd love to go back to marrakesh and this hotel in particular. The city is a mix of so many cultures and the hotel is a relaxing oasis!

Les Jardins de la Medina,JLN64 wrote a review Oct 2022,40,Lovely hotel (but not so keen on the area),This is a great hotel in a less nice part of Marrakech. Once inside the front door its a lovely oasis from the city. We loved our room the beautiful calm garden and pool area the spa and the friendly staff. Breakfast and lunch were great (fresh salads chilled wine) but dinner just OK (overcooked meat and different atmosphere). Wifi was OK but needs to reload every time you use it which becomes annoying.  We loved Marrakech overall but found the Kasbah part of the Medina too stressful. We ended up using taxis to avoid the walk through this district. We chose a solarium room with a private sun terrace which got sun most of the day and was amazing. Looking over the garden its private and very calming. The bedroom and bathroom were spacious and the bed very comfortable. The room was quiet until the last night when some noisy neighbours below spoiled things. The hotel need to act more decisively to address this sort of thing. You can also hear the prayer call from the local mosque but its not too loud.  The outdoor gym area doesn't seem to be used. The spa was amazing with very good hammam which is worth a try and nice massages at good prices. A good choice especially if you value the calm of a large garden/pool area. But more of a good 4 star than 5 star experience.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Harrogate, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JLN64

Room - we had a superior garden room which we loved - v. big and furnished tastefully .. only issue was we thought from website photos it would have a balcony/patio so check what you are getting !    The pool area was great - sunbeds a bit close together but no shortage.    Breakfast ok - had egg station for omelettes etc bit disappointed that one day there was bacon next it was gone !    Service - staff v friendly but service pretty inconsistent. Ie we sat in restaurant area in garden for over 20 mins waiting for service / menu on 2 occasions - although waiters had definitely seen us - and in end had to go to bar ourselves. Exception was the pool area where the young guy was really attentive and service was great.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Mr D wrote a review Aug 2022,50,An Oasis of Tranquility,A gem of a hotel in Kasbah Set away from the hustle and bustle of Medina (which in my honest opinion is a very good thing) the hotel is amazing as soon as you walk in. Greeted by friendly and helpful staff and given welcome drinks and snacks. The hotel is unique in that is somewhere in between a road and a hotel. The decor is different from many places you find in Marrakech it‚Äôs colonial. The gardens of the hotel and pool are simply stunning. It is rare to find somewhere as peaceful as this in Marrakech especially in the old town.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Fiona B wrote a review Jul 2022,50,Favourite Hotel Ever,This is a small hotel where the staff are lovely and cannot do enough for you. It is very well run and full of small thoughtful touches - such as being able to pick a perfume for your room and toiletries little candles outside lighting up the walkways little terraces to sit and have a drink - its just fantastic. Breakfast sitting outside was a dream - the courtyard is big enough to have a lovely pool which was perfect for chilling out in the hot afternoons. It‚Äôs a good location just inside the south side of the Medina - you can easily walk to many of the site seeing attractions and there is a narrow road outside which means you can be picked up and dropped off just outside. We will definitely go back. We went with two 16 year old boys who also loved it - so works for family couples or friends. Close to a very modern airport so a great bolt hole too if you need a bit of winter sun. Oh and it was very quiet.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Jure wrote a review Apr 2022,20,"Would not recommend, better look elsewhere",Property is beautiful and peaceful spa is good room is clean and we had a nice fireplace in the room that was arranged with wood upon request. Reservation team responded in a timely manner which was also appreciated.    With this said service in the restaurant and front desk is very poor and a huge let down for the hotel. The only person that I would highlight is the lady server in the restaurant which was polite smiling and accommodating. And it ends here. Everyone else either only care about elder guests to get more money from them or they do not speak sufficient English or they do not know how to do their job or just do not care and you have to figure out things by yourself.    Concierge help non existent and no one was able to assist in our request to check with the requirements to board a plane back home so we had to do it by ourselves. Only thing they can do is to call for you a taxi (which than charges you more than concierge said it would be - we already expected this).    No personalized serviced. I had a birthday while staying there and not a single gesture was extended even though I mentioned in advance that we are coming to stay there due to that. My wife actually had to ask a spa team if a small cake can be arranged. But small gesture in the room forget about it.    Early breakfast on departure: we requested in advance what we would like to get and at what time since we had to leave hotel before breakfast started. Breakfast was prepared later as requested and only with a glass of orange juice coffee one croissant one pain au chocolate and one yoghurt per person even though on the form you get also cereals bread fruits. This was not done. No bread basket no jam no honey nothing and we had to wait almost 30 minutes after requested time. Not how you want a guest to leave the property.    Dinned twice for dinner: manager is there speaking with only older guests we were completely ignored not even hello or eye contact. Server brought the food and even though it was correct order while removing the cover of the food he mentioned different order and while we tried to open the cover to see what is there he was pushing the cover back down. Seriously? After we saw that it was correct order he turned it into a joke. Excuse me?    We had glasses for wine and water pre-arranged on the desk but when we ordered beer they brought additional two glasses so we ended up with 6 big glasses on a small table and no one bothered to remove the empty glasses so there was almost not enough space for food. No one bothers to offer another round of drinks or remove empty bottles or to offer additional bottle of water.    We used the fireplace and housekeeping did not bother to remove the ashes the next day while cleaning the room.    We booked the couples treatment in spa but for the message part we were in different rooms. This is than not a couples treatment.    Wifi did not work on the balcony of the room.    Overall disappointed and would not recommend. There are much better cheaper options with far more superior and personalized service around Marrakech.,Date of stay: March 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jurel2016

Great to have a beautiful garden and pool to come back to after the heat and chaos of the Marrakech medina.We also used the spa for massages and nails which were all very good . You can walk everywhere from here . Arrived here during ramadam so in the evening everything shuts down from 7-7.30pm so make sure you book your resturants to work round this .Ideal weather not to hot .The breakfast was fantastic something for everyone and nothing was to much trouble . We ate in the resturant on the first night which wasnt as good as it could of been  we had the mixed salad starter which was a bad example of this course compared to all the other mixed salad starters we had  it was good service though but we do feel it could be improved and would be great to improve that so you could just come back from a busy day in the Medina and have a good authentic moroccan meal.We would definitley come back to this hotel and would recommend this well situated establishment .,Date of stay: April 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q2493DKjulias
Les Jardins de la Medina,Sunny P wrote a review Apr 2022,50,Beautiful property,This is our third night at this hotel. The garden is beautiful with lush greens and turtles. Rooms surround the garden. We have one of the junior suites which has its own little patio with chaises and chairs. The room is clean and has all the modern conveniences. Each evening someone comes to spray fragrance of your choice on your pillows. They supply 2 large bottles of water each day which you will need every drop of because it is very dry here. I wish I brought some saline nasal sprays!!  Alfresco Breakfast buffet isn‚Äôt lavish but very nice.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Steve V wrote a review Apr 2022,50,It's like Narnia!!,We arrived at a small door in a red wall on a narrow road in the Medina of Marrakech and were told by the driver 'you are here' which was a bit of a surprise. But walking through that door it was like going in to Narnia. We found the most beautiful and tranquil gardens and a truly fantastic hotel. The welcome included mint tea pastries olives and nuts and we were given the choice of three scents that were to be sprayed on our pillows at night. The staff could not have been more friendly and attentive. The bedroom was amazing with the biggest bed ever. Rose petals were always in abundance when the room was cleaned; robes were free for use as was a wicker carrier bag containing straws hats for use around the pool or on the roof top. The food was excellent too. We would thoroughly recommend having a Hamman at the hotel's spa on day one. The staff and quality of the massages were brilliant. I cannot recommend this hotel enough to those who want a peaceful retreat away from the hubbub of the city....,Date of stay: March 2022,,"Uckfield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/225stephenv

Les Jardins de la Medina,Fabrice D wrote a review Sep 2021,40,"With the biggest private garden in the Medina, it is a charming hotel with professional staff. An oasis to consider !!",If you are expecting a fancy hotel with the latest gadgets or design you may wish to consider other addresses in the Palmeraie or Hivernage. Here however the garden offers a historical oasis in the South of the Medina. If its walls could talk some guests names would sound familiar. Professional and well trained staff where nothing is too much trouble.  Comfortable and well appointed rooms I recommend you opt for those with a private roof terrace and shower to benefit from the beautiful view over the expansive gardens.  A good restaurant with a high standard of French/Moroccan cuisine delicious a la carte breakfast served in your choice of the room or restaurant a great size swimming pool which beats any Riad plunge pool. We did not try the spa during our stay but there is plenty of choice for weary travellers    Overall a great choice and oasis of calm in the hectic Medina which I highly recommend !,Date of stay: September 2021,,"Thonex, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/easyfabs

Staff upgraded us with no trouble at all and did this for free. We were blown away by this kind gesture and was the cherry on the cake as upgraded room was fabulous. Pool is fantastic the staff are 100% courteous the gardener we met outside helped us find a local artisan shop.

Les Jardins de la Medina,brighton50 wrote a review Feb 2020,50,Lovely choice for Marrakech,The hotel is a real riad (ie it has a large garden in the centre) rather than a dar (a house with courtyards). It is in the south of the walled city a short 10 or 15 minute walk to Place Jemaa el Fna. Everything is walkable and easy to find. It has lovely roof top terraces with chairs and loungers a pool and lovely gardens (it was nice to sit in the quiet gardens after a busy day). The garden bedrooms on the ground floor open out onto the center garden so privacy here is limited. Other rooms have nice balcony or terraces. Our room was large and had a nice terrace. Lovely Moroccan decorations everywhere. We ate in the restaurant a few times and enjoyed the food and atmosphere. There was a selection of local and international food. Breakfast was also good with a cooking station to cook eggs etc to order. It was convenient not having to find somewhere outside every evening.

Les Jardins de la Medina,magnoliiatree wrote a review Jan 2020,50,The perfect combination of traditional riad and boutique hotel - very special!,Just returned from a four-night stay over New Year. Can't say enough good things about Les Jardins de la Medina. There are many fantastic riads in Marrakech (we stayed at a smaller riad near the main square last time and it was excellent) ‚Äì but Les Jardins is a perfect mix of old-style riad charm combined with the facilities and service of a high-class boutique hotel.    As others have said it is truly an oasis in the mad bustle of Marrakech. Walking distance to many of the city‚Äôs attractions - but more than that we looked forward eagerly to returning to this tranquil haven each day after sightseeing.    We stayed in one of the Sultana Suites room 117 on the top floor and it was perfect for us. Spacious light and airy room (bedroom plus adjacent sitting room) with lots of thoughtful details to make it special. The roomy terrace is tucked high up in the partial shade of the beautiful trees I loved hearing the frequent chirruping of the birds that make the garden their home. The central courtyard gardens are truly gorgeous and beautifully maintained a major selling point. So peaceful and relaxing I doubt there‚Äôs anything else like it in the medina. The pictures don‚Äôt do it justice.    We ate three times in the restaurant and loved it. They have got the ambience just right it feels intimate and atmospheric sophisticated and classy but without being too formal would recommend eating here even if you‚Äôre not staying at the property. One meal was the New Year Dinner it was superb. Five delicious courses spread over the course of the evening with tasteful entertainment / live music in between. The chefs here are really really good. The trio of desserts was spectacular worthy of a French patisserie. So much care and attention to detail went into every aspect of that meal when they could so easily have churned out fairly basic food to milk the New Year market. Bravo to all concerned a triumph!    ALL the staff are absolutely wonderful and work so hard to make your experience great. Everyone from the front desk to the waiters to the cleaning and maintenance team was brilliant. They make everything so easy for you.    I could go on and on listing what makes this place so wonderful ‚Äì suffice to say this would be our No 1. choice when we return to Marrakech.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Fil0fax wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Exceptional little gem of paradise.,Like many riads you enter the hotel directly from the hustle and bustle of the busy narrow streets within the Medina. Reception is laid back and stress free with your bags taken care of whilst you enjoy a complimentary drink and discussion of the features of. You even get to choose which scent you would like sprayed on your pillow at turndown each evening.  The highlights are the attractive gardens surrounding a good sized pool with plenty of loungers and towels available. The roof top terrace is an excellent spot to enjoy a sundowner or two. Just call down to the bar on the telephone and they will bring your drinks up for you.  We travelled as two couples staying for 3 nights. We dined with the hotel on our first evening and had some fun with the menu. Some of the English translations mean you have to use your imagination. The theatre of the presentation was a nice touch. A good selection of wine and would recommend the tagines. The lamb shank is superb and creative how your waiter will remove from the bone.  Good location to walk to restaurants and attractions. Saadian Tombs leisurely 10 minutes walk away.

The beauty of this hotel is that you can plunge into the throes of Marrakesh and then retreat within its wars for some R&R when the activity becomes too much. It was pretty quiet when I was there (the pre-Christmas lull) and some routine maintenance work was being carried out which was occasionally on the noisy side.

As you enter the door there is a beautiful calmness after the noise and bustle outside. Within the first 10 minutes you select the fragrance for your pillows as you refresh your hands and face with a hot towel to then snack on dates and almonds and mint tea. The attention to detail is delightful and the staff are so helpful. The restaurant serves good food the swimming pool is heated to a very pleasant temperature there is a small outdoor gym just in case you have over indulged in the restaurants (great breakfast choice). The Spa is great. Although tempted by other options rated highly on TA we went to the hotel one and were very pleased that we did. The Hammam was great and the massage very relaxing. I was very pleased that I could just don a bathrobe at the end and return to the room rather than being offsite and having to get dressed while still very oily post massage.

We ate in the hotel and every meal we had was delicious especially the huge desserts. Reception staff organised taxis and guides for us thank you! My only two minor criticisms are the slightly unreliable wifi and the staircase lighting on the way to rooms 130/131 - on dark nights the staircase could probably benefit from an extra light source.

Les Jardins de la Medina,marystmb wrote a review Nov 2019,50,A special place in Marrakech,A delightful oasis of calm with excellent service from staff and a high standard of catering . The bedrooms are spacious and characterful with all the extras expected in a quality hotel. My one criticism is the inadequate and noisy air conditioning unit that despite being reported could not be regulated to cool the air. Had the weather been hot this would have been a major issue. The central garden with its lush foliage and well sized heated pool is a delight.

Les Jardins de la Medina,ga5tro wrote a review Oct 2019,50,A break in Marrakesh,With a group of friends we have travelled to a number of places together in recent years. This year we came to Marrakesh and I can confirm that we all had a great time. This was made all the more so by our stay at The Jardins de la Medina. Their attention to our requirements were quite remarkable and nothing was too much trouble. Good advice was offered on what to see and where to go and help freely offered with arrangements for eating away from the hotel and guided trips. The food at the hotel was of a very high standard and it was served with a smile! The bar staff were very helpful and often exceeded my expectations! On the speciality Friday evening the magician was a delight and it was great to meet the Director and head of Sales and Marketing. It was also great to be introduced to the six baby tortoises born in the gardens! I usually view my overall stay at an hotel with the simple question would I return? I can say that in the case of this hotel the answer is a resounding YES!,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Wolverhampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ga5tro

Les Jardins de la Medina,LoobyLoo wrote a review Sep 2019,50,Idyllic getaway in the heart of the Medina,This is the most idyllic hotel - an oasis of calm in the hustle and bustle of Marrakech. The gardens are tranquil and calm and so beautiful. The food was excellent. The staff were very helpful and really friendly. The room was stunning and really comfortable.  The only point I would like to make is that to make the hotel completely perfect it would be good to have a better gym - doesn‚Äôt need to be large just have a treadmill cross trainer rower and bike and some free weights kettle bells and exercise balls mats and a bench. I am a runner and as a woman (apart from the heat) couldn‚Äôt really safely go out and run. So a better gym would have been ideal. Just a suggestion to improve not a criticism.  My daughter and I had a fabulous stay here in what proved to be a perfect location for most of the sights.

Les Jardins de la Medina,wendygo wrote a review Aug 2019,10,"Filthy Dump, Health Hazard",We travel more than I review and have stayed in Marrakech prior to this trip although not at this hotel. The horrible experience we had in this overrated misrepresented poorly staffed dark musty and moldy hotel cannot be overstated.  We arrived in the late morning for check-in and decided to indulge in a Hamman scrub and massages to relax. The cramped spa was beyond underwhelming and looked like an afterthought. This spa was empty that day and the availability for services not surprisingly was wide open for our entire planned 6-day stay. During the scrub the service provider poured water in my ear while rinsing my hair and gave me an earache as a token of the experience.  When we were finally shown to our room late afternoon it was down a long poorly lit dark hallway. I said to the guest services woman showing us to our room that I cannot stay in this room because I can smell the must & mold. I said that I have allergies and asthma and that she please needed to find us another room. After waiting a brief time we went back to the reception check-in/desk to explain our concerns again. Their solution at that time was to bring an incense burner to the room in an attempt to mask the smell. The hotel manager Mme Christine was onsite and because she was clearly not addressing this issue we emphasized to the front desk that we cannot stay in the room and to find us another room. We asked to speak with Mme Christine but apparently she was too busy to speak with us. We did not want to stay in the room hoping to move soon so decided to explore the rest of the dirty bird and turtle excrement filled grounds. I am an animal lover however being surrounded with excrement is not healthy or acceptable for anyone. There was no towel nor beverage service around the pool and the cramped dirty foliage-covered loungers did not induce a relaxing atmosphere. Not at all looking like their advertising photos. The hotel is filled with birds who will wake you up at 5am screeching like a scene from the movie the Birds. The grounds are worn dated dirty and a health hazard. The amenities are extremely limited and understaffed. Front desk/guest services staff are incompetent or undertrained and neglectful. Mme Christine was neglectful incompetent and overall shady with our situation.    We were tired from traveling and decided to stay at the hotel for dinner and also we were still anticipating a room change. Once again we went to the guest services desk and a man was there and he was aware of our situation but said he would get back to us after his break from fast because he was very hungry. I explained I was already beginning to feel asthmatic after the limited time in our room and that this room issue must be handled. Not surprisingly we did not hear back from him nor Mme Christine.    Fast forward I had a full-blown asthma attack that night  we had been beyond patient and were now very frustrated. We reached out to our travel agent and made alternative hotel accommodations for my health and before I ended up in the hospital.  The incompetent and neglectful hotel manager Mme Christine ( who has been there apparently for many years) came up to us just moments before our car service was to take us to the new hotel. It had been almost 24 hours since our arrival at this place and she and her staff had no sincere concern for my health. She finally made a patronizing weak attempt to offer a new room but she had hours that morning to do this and waited until she saw that we were packed ready to go in the lobby. Clearly she was just covering herself so she could say that she had attempted to give us a new room.  In summary; we were beyond patient and gave this hotel every opportunity possible. This hotel had no regard nor empathy towards my health or safety. This hotel clearly doesn‚Äôt care about making guests happy. We paid for all of our services and night in the hotel and we did not dispute this in any way. We incurred the expense of two hotels for the remaining 4 nights because Mme Christine covered her tracks by  stating that she had done everything possible to try and accommodate us.

Les Jardins de la Medina,GaryandMelody wrote a review Aug 2019,50,A true oasis in Marrakech,We asked the hotel if they could arrange transport for us from the airport as we had read earlier reviews and were uncertain we could find a taxi driver who could find it in the medina. The hotel arranged everything and we were met on arrival and that was the start of our fantastic stay here. Our room was very spacious with lots of windows and light and beautifully decorated. All of the previous reviewers who rave about the food here are right on the money We had all 3 meals a day here (in between wandering all over the place) and really loved every meal. The staff all spoke excellent English which is so comforting for us and were always friendly and so helpful. On one day the hotel arranged a guide for us to do a walking tour of the medina and Sahib our guide knew everywhere and just about everyone in Marrakech. The people in Marrakech are so friendly we even had a policeman come up to us in the new part of the city greet us when we asked for directions and told us that this was a safe city - it is true. We would definitely recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here if we ever visited again.,Date of stay: August 2019,,Sydney,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryandMelody
Les Jardins de la Medina,Guy R wrote a review Aug 2019,50,Holiday August 2019,We came here as a couple for 6 days in August. This hotel is fantastic.    It's a tranquil haven in the bustling Medina. 15 minute taxi ride you arrive via the small streets to a low key tiny door. Once through the reception the hotel opens out into an Oasis. The hotel feels like a whole city block surrounding a beautiful garden with tall palm trees filled with birds.    The hotel has a large area for drinks a very large restaurant area with the option of inside or outside (canopy covered) seating. A beautiful pool spa seating areas on terraces and within the garden. They even have great little shop.    Our room was ideal a very comfortable bed and a separate seating area. Very quiet except for the birds chirping in the morning. A nice big shower. Tea coffee safe and TV. And importantly A/C which kept out the 40C heat.    Not only is the hotel luxurious but the staff are friendly and service immaculate. Drinks and snacks at the pool were speedily delivered with a large ice bucket the reception sorted taxis in seconds and the restaurant staff are a delight.    The hotel is 20 minute walk through the Medina to the main square or a 10 minute taxi which goes round the pedestrian zone.    We spent the day by the pool lunched at the hotel and then explored the souks and museums in the evening once things cooled down. Coming back to the sanctuary of the hotel for drinks or dinner was a delight.    Breakfast is delicious I'd recommend their freshly squeezed orange juice and omelettes. Lunch was our favourite meal as we shared a few moroccan specialities I'd recommend the prawns with pineapple rice. They have all the traditional moroccan options any dinner tangines couscous although their lamb cooked moroccan style stood out as a favourite. Some of the menu translations from French are a bit obscure.    They sell reasonably priced red white and rose moroccan wines by the glass half bottle or bottle.    The pool temperature is ideal with lots of seating. The sun loungers were grouped in 3's rather than pairs which was a bit odd as it left a lot of empty spaces reducing the capacity when the pool was busy. Although we never had a problem getting tow loungers.    The hotel has about 35 rooms which seems perfect as whilst it felt personal there were still plenty of people about for an atmosphere.There was fun mix of couples and families.    Great staff we'll definitely be returning.    I'd summarise this place as a luxurious boutique hotel with excellent service.,Date of stay: August 2019,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/879guyr

The hotel matches my expectation and is in a great location for visitors who wish to explore the heritage of this historical city. It is located within the Medina within walking distance to all historical landmarks. Typical for all Arabic cities Les Jardins is hidden in a maze of narrow lanes and alleyways. The entrance is to the hotel is hardly noticeable and once the little wooden door is opened it opens up to a new paradise which is in fact a small castle.  The room rate is considered high by Marrakech standard stayed there 5 nights in two types of suite. The sultan suite is highly recommended. The are about a handful of such suites located at the corners of this complex on upper floors. The suites are huge with separate living and bed rooms within sun-terrace/ balconies. The suite which I stayed cost about 250Euro per night including breakfast. Spread of breakfast is a bit limited but the hotel offers great dinner which although is great is relatively expensive by local standards when compared to similar restaurants around the 'Square' : Jemma el-Fnna.,Date of stay: July 2019,,"Shenzhen, China",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HKG_Traveller2010

It was a fantastic stay at the hotel was such a highlight. As we arrived we were greeted by a friendly concierge and a welcome drink on the terrace. They then shoed us to our rooms which were beautifully decorated quiet and equipped with air con.    As it was so hot we spent a ot of time by the pool. As sun seekers we found the one spot by the pool that managed to have the sun on it all day. The rest of the pool area was in shade. For me I prefer to sit in the sun but as it was so hot you could see why the pool was so shaded. It was very peaceful and relaxing to be able to have a dip in a cold pool after a busy day visiting the Souks.    The included breakfast buffet was fantastic; they had an egg station where a chef made omelettes scrambled eggs or fried eggs and there were pastries fruit and cereals to choose from. Lunch and dinner were not included but we had one lunch and one dinner there and both were fantastic.

Les Jardins de la Medina,vas13 wrote a review Jul 2019,50,An oasis of tranquility in the middle of Kasbah,We just came back from our holiday in Morocco where we stayed in this wonderful hotel. Honestly I don't think we could have made a better choice.  Building: it's a renovated very old building decorated with character and great taste.  Garden: an oasis of tranquility. Beautiful mix of trees and in the middle is the pool. Pool could have been a bit deeper though. (1.60 m was the deepest.) The garden makes a great environment to spend your day and is so calming when you're back from the very noisy city centre. The garden also attracts a lot of little birds which is lovely to hear their singing when you wake up.  Room: We had the Solarium room. The size was good the bed large and very comfortable the bathroom was big as well as the shower. The drain in the shower was quite easily blocked though. When we mentioned it was fixed in no time but a day after the problem occurred again. Not a big deal for us so we didn't mentioned it again. The room had big closets and an electronic safe. Also a nice shaded balcony and on top a private terrace with sunbeds and a view to the garden. Lastly they had some lovely little touches that made a difference like complimentary espresso capsules to use with the machine in our room. A bottle of water was also offered daily tonus for free along with a wicar basket to use around the pool. Moreover a hammock was available for the private terrace too.  Restaurant: breakfast was included and It was very nice. Ok not the best I ever had but it had many things and is difficult to find something bad to say. You could have your own personalized omelette they had variation of breads and pastries and fresh yogurt and juices. In the afternoon the snacks menu need some improvement I'd say as the options were quite limited. As for the restaurant it's quite expensive for what it offers. The ambiance in the garden next to the pool is lovely and our meals were nice but not as nice for that price.  Cleanliness: one word spotless everywhere. Well done! The cleaners are doing a very good job.  Spa: We used the spa facilities with my partner. Again not bad but for the price we payed nothing special. The hammam is not really a proper hammam with loads of steam and the massage we had was more of a gentle stroke (which felt pleasing I have to say) than a proper massage. And that's been said by someone who prefers it soft and not rougher.  Location: Amazing! At least for us is exactly what we wanted. It's located in the Kasbah area next to the royal palace. In general it's a beautiful area very close to the Kasbah mosque and the Saadian tombs (10' walking distance) full of local shops and restaurants where the locals are friendly smiley respectful and not pushy at all with the tourists.  Staff: Last but not least the staff. They were all exceptional. Very professional friendly attentive loads of smiles and all with good manners. Bravo!  In general we enjoyed every minute of our stay and we have already recommended the hotel to friends and family. The hotel offers a very romantic scenery from a couple perspective and the little touches (drinks and nibbles on the welcome) really made a difference for us.,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vas13

The service from all the staff is second to none; courteous and friendly. Our room was on the first floor with a balcony with a lovely feeling of privacy. There were so many private places for sitting or relaxing and that is part of the charm.  The gardens are beautiful with many mature plants and the most amazing tall palms.  The pool is well kept. Breakfast was simple but well presented and the goats cheese delicious.  The Friday evening meet the staff was an unexpected touch and very pleasant.  Location we found was good as it was quiet in relation to many other in the Medina and a real treat your taxi could go right to the door.  Excellent pick up service from the airport via the hotel and glad we contacted them to use it.

The location is very good close to the palace and it is like an oasis. The kitchen is superb ! The lady-chef does a great job !  The service is very friendly but in general with 2 exceptions the lady staff is a lot faster! Breakfast is fantastic. The drain of the shower in our room was not working well so I was a bit scared to fall as the floor gets easily slippery from the soap is the drain is not working well.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Patrick P wrote a review Jul 2019,40,Not right on the night,This restaurant was highly recommended to us. We strolled through the warm Moroccan evening dodging cars and motorbikes while breathing their exhaust fumes.  The walk getting to and from the restaurant ended up being more exciting than the dining experience.    The restaurant hotel and setting looked good however the food that we were served...not so much.  One of the meal was taken off the bill as it wasn‚Äôt consumed so that kinda summed up the experience.    I think we probably had an off day dining experience as I truly think that wasn‚Äôt the norm. We didn‚Äôt stay too long but long enough to take a short look around and it seem a pretty nice place to both stay and to dine.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Greater London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Patrickson65

Les Jardins de la Medina,Margot S wrote a review Jun 2019,50,Great place to stay!,I love the combination of Morocco and France you get when you stay at places like this - two countries for the price of one! This is a lovely hotel very efficiently run with gorgeous gardens nicely appointed rooms and bathrooms and very comfy beds. And just a bit French!  We had a hammam which was lovely and ate at the restaurant for dinner which was truly delicious. Our first breakfast was the best in Morocco but the second was dodgy as no-one was about to cook at the breakfast bar or keep the sparrows off the food and they were really digging in. However it was Ramadan and I think you've got to give a bit when everyone around you is just shattered and exhausted from almost of month of fasting.  I'd recommend this lovely Riad despite the second brekky as everything else including the lovely staff was terrific.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,Yass,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marjorie_AnneYass
Les Jardins de la Medina,Daisy B wrote a review May 2019,50,Perfect Paradise inside the city,This was my second visit to the hotel but with a 10 year absence! My sister and I had the most fantastic stay and they did not disappoint. This is the perfect hotel for a city break but for those who still want to escape the buzz of the Medina. From the moment the door closes behind you there is a peace about the place only broken by the endless birds and rustling palm trees. We both had very nice rooms clean and quiet. The pool area does get quite busy but the top floor roof terrace is lovely and peaceful and has a shower if you need to cool off. We also visited the spa which was lovely. The only downside would be the level of service in the restaurant which can be quite slow. We were visiting during Ramadan so put this down to lethargy etc but it did seem quite chaotic with some diners around us being completely ignored for some time. If they could just get this element sorted as I have noticed other complaints of the same thing then it would be a completely faultless hotel. However if that is the only issue there really is nothing to complain about a truly relaxing escape and I cannot wait for another excuse to go back!,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/450daisyb

Les Jardins de la Medina,octim wrote a review May 2019,30,Nice hotel in lovely location but needs attention to a few points,Nice quiet setting. Relaxing environment behind a wooden door on a side street. Shaded courtyard with trees and flowering shrubs. Resident tortoises are great to see. Hotel has a very French bias. English spoken well but primarily aimed at French market. Service was generally very good and friendly. Restaurant service a bit hit and miss in the evenings. One evening we waited 30 minutes for service so had to leave and complain. Veal curry on the menu was excellent though.  Biggest problem is pool side. We never managed to get a bed by the pool for the 4 days we were there. I understand the hotel is open to people staying in nearby accommodation for lunch and use of pool. This is not acceptable considering the cost of staying here.  The room we had was great; very comfy.

We had several issues which after reception not really addressing I spoke with the lady director who really is charming and listened I could list the issues but not about trashing a place that fundamentally is beautiful but is not 5 star!! The director kindly gave me a leg massage in the hotel a very nice gesture and I thank you. However it's not the best idea when addressing the issues to say look at all the reviews how people love the hotel. I did too.    Breakfast needs complete rethink dried bread cakes tinned fruit there is some fresh fruit it is really very poor for what is described as 5 star.. hard fruit. Day before leaving arrived for breakfast 9 40 9 55 there clearing round me I was rushed food taken away.    Its very expensive food is very very average at best!! The calm around is great it has lost something as I explained to the director the spa is lovely.    I am happy to pay for quality food and have during my stay in Marrakech. See further reviews.    I hope the hotel listen and implement change where it is needed you can only run on past successes for a short time.    I wish the director well with her clear following of people return to attention to detail you did it so well.    I have included a photo of just an example of breakfast someone this morning walked into breakfast and walked out saying how poor I saw this from my table.

I very much enjoyed the nightly performances on the oud in the dining area. the room was fine but we were sorry it was not possible to keep the windows open at night as they would not have been secure. the room was consequently rather hot. somehow I didn't find the pool inviting though I love to swim as it was rather shady.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,crediton,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marilyn017
Les Jardins de la Medina,Pootle wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Tranquillity in Marrakech,We have just returned from this lovely hotel. Staff are attentive friendly full of smiles and happy to accomodate any request. They acted without even being asked when our transfer taxi was late by calling and sorting it out for us eventhough it had not been arranged by them.The location is about a 15-20 minute walk from Djemma el fna if you're not in a rush. The surrounding area is real Marrakech with every type of trade and business you could imagine so you are 'really' in the city which we loved. The hotel itself is an oasis in comparison to the attack on the senses that Marrakech will give you. Great pool area shaded quiet spots well appointed quiet rooms and a large bottle of mineral water was supplied every day. Good choice of continental breakfast and omlettes made to order. Restaurant food was good also but you can venture out to eat only a few minutes away. We didnt use the spa. We were there to celebrate a special occasion and this hotel certainly made it special by giving us complimentary champagne on arrival and upgrading our room to the solarium.

Les Jardins de la Medina,TravelerY7322W wrote a review Feb 2019,40,Beautiful stay - great pool,This was a really nice hotel to return to at the end of the day. It felt like an oasis. We liked the food at breakfast & dinner and the service. The pool was great (crucial when traveling with kids). The room was very pretty -- the beds were comfortable and the rooms were quiet at night. Great water/water pressure and products. I ended up buying the pillow spray -- so lovely! The location seems safe enough but at night it did feel a little bit too far from the restaurants we wanted to visit so we took taxis (the hotel called for us). We were VERY bothered by the air quality in the Medina which is not the hotel's fault obviously. I do think if we returned to Marrakech we would stay outside the Medina to have better air and just swoop in and out by taxi for sightseeing.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y7322W

Les Jardins de la Medina,Jennie L wrote a review Jan 2019,50,A haven amongst the bustling and fascinating streets of the Kasbah,A fabulous place to stay. Set in the heart of the Kasbah's narrow red ochre streets you would not know that behind the dull red wall there's a large garden with a variety of palms cacti orange trees and flowering plants with a heated swimming pool several small shady seating areas and an outdoor gym all sheltered by foliage. An oasis of peace and calm. And there's a roof terrace too beautifully furnished a sun trap with shaded sections and sun beds for sun lovers - and views of the Atlas mountains and the rooftops of Marrakech..    A smart restaurant with high ceilings and elegant lighting provided some excellent meals - chicken with preserved lemons and the traditional harira the local soup particularly stood out.    There's a small bar with an open fire - perfect for those cold evenings when you get back from a day's sightseeing - and there's an 'open air' room surrounded by curtains in the colder weather where you can eat in the evenings or take breakfast.    Breakfasts were an experience - a wide range of cold and hot foods ranging from an impressive selection of dried fruits to breakfast tagines; omelettes were made on the spot and there's a good selection of breads and pastries plus cold meats cheeses - the local; goats cheese is particularly delicious as is the sweet yoghurt cereal jams and preserves.    Service was generally very good; there were a couple of hiccoughs (sometimes a long wait for coffee in the mornings and the hot plates weren't always working; talk about first world problems.......) but we enjoyed every breakfast we had and looked forward to it each morning.    Our room on the ground floor was delightful - cosy with the shutters closed on cold nights (in addition to the radiator and marvellously hot towel rail there was some sort of underfloor heating) and light and airy with the windows and shutters open looking out onto the gardens; we had a small terrace which could be curtained off if you wanted complete privacy (the foliage was enough for us). The bed was on a raised area with intricate plasterwork on the ceiling and a firm comfortable bed. Our room (Room? We had a lounge area a bedroom and a bathroom - that's 3) was kept spotlessly clean and we loved the little touches - the rose petals the scented pillows the weather forecast for the following day delivered in the evenings. The cleaners were thorough and discreet - and very friendly when you occasionally bumped into one of them.    The staff were great - those on Reception were very helpful and informative and will organise anything you need. All staff were discreet and polite and if you're warm and friendly towards them they respond in kind.    And don't miss out on the hammam. It was a wonderful experience to have the steam scrub and treatment - and I had a facial as well; both were lovely and well worth the price. Staff were charming.    We can't do this lovely ryad justice - it was a unique experience. Luxury. And we're not used to that. It's all very well designed and well run.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Coofs wrote a review Dec 2018,50,"Comfortable luxury, in Medina",Les Jardins de la Medina lies at the southern end of the oldest part (Kasbah) of the Medina (old city) of Marrakech. A simple brisk 15 minute walk all on the flat through busy streets alive with locals and tourists alike (the former on foot bicycles scooters donkey carts horse drawn carriages and in cars) gets you to the Jamaa el Fna the Medina‚Äôs mesmeric main square. (A longer hours walk got us to the rightly much vaunted Jardins Majorelle).    The hotel a former minors royal palace is clean and well presented if not luxurious with always a warm and welcoming and polite ‚ÄòBonjour‚Äô/‚ÄòBonsoir‚Äô from the friendly staff. For Marrakech the USP compared to a more traditional Riad is the mature garden and outdoor pool which provide a peaceful oasis of calm especially welcome after the assault on the senses engendered in walking through the souks.    Our afternoon snack and evening meal were fabulously tasty and well-presented. ‚ÄòVegetables on toast‚Äô elevated to another level of freshness and delicate taste. Our tagines (beef and seafood) were well-cooked hearty and enjoyable. Prices were above average hotel-level. Breakfast was buffet style with an egg-station mix of pastries dried fruits local dish (e.g. eggs Marocaine lentils and sausages etc.) breads cold meats and cheeses etc.    The room we chose had a private sun-terrace and despite it being in November in between light showers we enjoyed a few hours relaxing in 21degrees or so of warming watery sunshine mainly in the afternoons.    The bathroom was all-in-one clean and tidy without being ‚Äòsuper-glossy‚Äô. (A slightly cracked toilet seat was replaced with a new soft-close replacement before we had reported it).    Unlike all the restaurants we visited the hotel served wine and beer both to a good standard.    We arranged a tour guide for half a day through the hotel which was a good call in so far as the visits we made to the Saadiens Tombs and Bahia Palace as neither attractions had any explanations which our guide was able to compensate for knowledgable and engagingly. Less good were the rug and herbaliste stops where the expectation (and a degree of pressure in the former) to buy felt uncomfortable.    All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our stay - well looked after and within comfortable walking distance of the crazy Jamaa el Fna souks restaurants and main attractions.,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Coofs

Les Jardins de la Medina,Dominik wrote a review Dec 2018,20,Nice and cosy but be careful of your personal belongings,I recently stayed in the Riad of Les Jardines de la Medina together with my family for 4 nights. We all highly enjoyed the time in this beautiful place and the cosy atmosphere you would not expect in this area of the Medina.    Unfortunately after we have left this hotel to continue our journey through Morocco we noticed that several personal belongings in our luggage are missing. First we thought that we may have forgotten some of these items already at home but after a while we started to realize that these items have been all with us during our stay in Marrakesh and apparently must have been removed during our stay from our rooms in the Les Jardins de la Medina. Although these items (male and female clothes as well as baby clothes and toys) were luckily not very expensive (roughly EUR 120 in total) we are very disappointed about this situation as this never happened to us on any other journey before and we also would have not expected this to happen in a hotel like the Les Jardins de la Medina.    Back home we have informed both our travel agency as well as the hotel about this situation. Not surprisingly the hotel management replied that the started to search for your missing items but could not find them. Now 3 weeks later there have not been any news. I therefore suppose our items will never appear again and can deem as been stolen.    Like I said at the beginning we really liked our stay in this hotel and would have recommended the Les Jardin de la Medina to our friends and families as well as to our travel agency without any restrictions. But sadly in the light of the aforementioned experiences we have serious doubts of doing so.,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dominikm491

I was on a trip with my sister and wanted a riad with an outdoor pool a spa and within walking distance to the souk. This ticked all the boxes and was a beautiful oasis with a great restaurant and lovely rooms. We had a hammam and massage in the spa which was bliss and really enjoyed a dinner and the breakfast each morning. The location is great as it‚Äôs a gentle 15 minute walk to the souk. On the way you pass a huge emporium with literally thousands of rugs so we were able to buy lots of stuff there and easily carry it back.

Les Jardins de la Medina,MM Sandhurst wrote a review Dec 2018,50,Romantic Stay in a beautiful Riad within the Medina,We were really impressed with the riad once we had entered from the street. The reception area is cool and welcoming and it then opens out into a beautiful large garden full of palms and fruit trees at the centre of which was a heated swimming pool.The rooms surround the central garden and we were upgraded to a sunny room overlooking the pool. It had its own side terrace with table and chairs then a stairway to a private roof-terrace. The double bed was enormous and comfortable and the bathroom was immaculate and well laid out. There was a large walk-in shower area. Sheets and towels were changed daily unless you indicated that you did not require a change just a remake - very green.We stayed on a B&B basis. Breakfast was a comprehensive buffet with an egg chef to prepare omelettes etc. We had one lunch in and two dinners in our 5 day stay. The food quality was excellent predominantly authentic Moroccan dishes. many of the were very sweet to our taste and we didn't encounter any spicy dishes which we were expecting. Food service was exemplary.Service from Reception was also of the highest quality - nothing too much trouble to arrange.Our only minor niggle was very low water pressure from our bathroom sink (which was partly repaired after reporting it) and a slow-draining shower trap (Room 107).If we came to Marrakech again we would definitely return to this hotel,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sandhurst, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MM_Sandhurst

Les Jardins de la Medina,Susan G wrote a review Sep 2018,40,Beautiful property with a few service issues,"This is a beautiful property with a stunning pool area and garden. However there are a few service issues.    A transport from the airport was included in the price of our room and they asked for our flight information on booking. However on arrival to Marrakesh there was no one at the airport with a sign saying ""Les Jardins de la Medina"" as promised. It took several calls to the hotel (quite expensive on my international plan) to get this straightened out and finally a driver from another tour company came to collect us. Upon arrival at the hotel there was no apology just a little shrug and comment that it was a ""communication problem"".    Just a warning that while many photos of the rooms show that they have outdoor terraces and balconies ours did not even though we had booked one of the more expensive rooms. It was large but when we asked about a room with an outdoor space we were told that they did not have one in the same category as the one we had booked. We had further issues with the room when there was an unusually heavy rainstorm that evening. Water was pouring in through the ceiling above the windows and under the door flooding our entire room. We called the front desk and they sent a woman from the housekeeping who did some cursory sweeping and mopping and then left while the water was still pouring in the room. We had to get all the bath towels and clean up the mess ourselves and try to stop the flow of water under the door. Then we called to the front desk again to request more towels. The same housekeeper came back with a bad attitude scolding us for using so many towels. We talked to the manager about the incident the following day. She just shrugged and said ""What can we do? It's an old building"". It's not their fault that it rained but really we shouldn't have to be mopping the floor ourselves in a hotel of this level.    Earlier in the day this same housekeeper and come into our room without knocking while I was in the bathroom. I thought my husband had come into the room and called out several times. She didn't answer and I was quite startled to walk out of the bathroom half-dressed and find her in the room doing the turn-down service (at only 3 in the afternoon). I expressed a little shock that she had not knocked and asked her to come back a little later. She had a bad attitude and left never finishing the turn-down service. In fact the turn-down was never done again for the 3 days that we were there even though at check-in they make a big show of having you smell 3 different scents and telling you that your sheets will be sprayed each night with the one you prefer.    They did really try with a little manager's reception one night were were there. Free drinks and appetizers were served in the beautiful garden with live music. They noticed that it was my husband's birthday and surprised us with singing and a plate of desert which was a nice gesture. However after we ate in the restaurant that night my husband became sick and that kind of ruined the last day of our vacation.    Also this hotel is a good 25 minute walk from the Djemaa el Fna the main square. It is quiet and peacefully located but if you want to be closer to the action this is not the place for you.    So in conclusion the property is beautiful. You should ask specifically for a room with an outdoor seating area. The management could work on being a little more courteous to guests when issues arise. Also I think is is wise to be careful of what food (particularly meat) you eat throughout Morocco even when the restaurant seems to be quite upscale and the restaurant at Les Jardins is no exception.",Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Tenafly, New Jersey",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zanian1122
Les Jardins de la Medina,Anne-Marie C wrote a review Sep 2018,40,Great Hotel and most of the staff very friendly.,I would have given this hotel an excellent however we had a couple of small issues as below therefore I would rate it as good not very good but definitely not average;  1. The room smelt of sewage on and off - Seemed to be ok if the air-conditioning and fan was turned off.  2. I Had a brand new black bottle of Channel Noir that went down to half a bottle in a couple of days and chunks of chocolate were taken from our room - In future I will always put my good perfume in the safe.    We did bring these issues up with reception within a couple of days of our stay but nothing was actually done. On checkout we were greeted with a bill for daily taxes for about ¬£50 for three of us. I queried this with the receptionist as we had not been made aware of this charge when we checking in. He was very rude and when showed us the small text on the holiday voucher it was suggested that we did know about this fee an that we were lying. The lady receptionist with him was very understanding and when my husband brought up the few above matters we had complained about she decided to get the manager. The manager was very understanding and upset that nothing had been sorted out with our room as she was well aware of the issues and offered us small gifts and an upgrade if we ever returned she also got the male recepitionst to apologise. Please note that he was not the normal receptionist through out our stay and the other 2 regular receptionists (one male & female) were both lovely and helpful including the rest of the hotel staff.    My husbands mum also came on holiday with us and her room was a wow factor and she had no problems at all so maybe we were just unlucky and we would consider going back. The food in the restaurant was amazing especially the Lamb chops in-fact we loved all the Riads in Marrakesh and we are looking forwards to returning in the future.,Date of stay: September 2018,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Go736608

Les Jardins de la Medina,Lynn D wrote a review Aug 2018,30,It's all about the service,"My two daughters and I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights beginning on August 5th. The hotel is lovely. Beautiful gardens and pool. During our stay we had a series of events which if handled better by the hotel staff would have been chalked up to bad luck but turned into something much more.  Day 1 - The drain in the shower backed up flooding the entire bedroom. We through down towels and called maintenance.  Day 2 - We arrived back from our day in the Medina to find our room full of workers with ladders in the ceiling door wide open etc. Had we been given prior notice no big deal. The surprise was a bit unsettling. Later that afternoon the power went out in 6 rooms for several hours. Need I mention that it is HOT in Marrakesh in the summer. But things happen.  Day 3 - i asked reception to book a dinner reservation for us. They said that they would. Went out for the day and returned to find that our room smelled of sewage. The smell was coming from the shower drain. I called for maintenance and they sent a lovely young lady with perfume. I explained that this would not fix the problem. They finally sent for the maintenance guy. Meanwhile we prepared for dinner. Reception called a cap and we set off for our restaurant only to arrive and find that the place had closed the week before. Returning to the hotel I inquired about our reservation request. They checked their records and it clearly stated that they had called and discovered the place had closed. Would have been nice to know before we set off in our taxi. We then asked reception for a recommendation. They asked if we wanted Moroccan food and we said no. They gave us an address and we set off waling through the Medina only to find that it was a Moroccan restaurant.  Day 4 - check out. We were leaving Marrakesh for a 1 night stay in the Atlas mountains. We were to return the following night to the same hotel. I explained that if we did return that I wanted a new room and a refund so that we could obtain different lodging. The manager took no responsibility for anything. No of the issues were related to poor maintenance of the hotel and the 6 room power outage was ""caused by the city"". Entire hotel maybe but not 6 rooms.  We did not return to this hotel and our guide is still working with his agency to get our funds refunded. Beyond this it was difficult to get waiters at both the pool and the restaurant.

I felt at ease from the moment I arrived and was offered a welcome drink and a seat in the lush garden. Being surrounded by the greenery made me feel calm and there were chairs/ loungers to relax on in the garden.    The staff were wonderful very hospitable and attentive to our needs. The rooms were spacious and had everything we needed. An iron and ironing board were swiftly provided to us when requested.    The selection of food at breakfast was adequate. There wasn‚Äôt much change in items during the week however this wasn‚Äôt a problem because it tasted great and I looked forward to eating it the next day. We tried lunch dinner and poolside dining also and all meals were great. Fabulous food that was beautifully presented. One night we ate around the pool and listened to performers which was a nice change to the regular dinner.    We ended the week with a couples treatment and it was thoroughly relaxing. It started with a hammam and finished with a body massage. Keep hydrated as the overall experience lasts around three hours! We were due to check-out on this day and were provided with a complimentary room for the afternoon to relax before our flight in the evening. Many thanks to the staff for arranging this.    I would recommend this hotel for a short break it‚Äôs a ten-to-fifteen minute walk to some attractions.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Philmar501 wrote a review Jul 2018,50,Cannot praise it enough! Did not want to leave!,Honestly from pick up in Casablanca to smiles of Smail on check in I really felt like I was at home. My husband and I had not seen eachother for months and it was our first break away from the kids in years... and we are beyond glad we chose this beautiful Riad with its amazing staff and stunning grounds. Our Sultana room with the balcony was perfect the hairdryer was absolutely fantastic (important) and the atmosphere was relaxed and calm. The food at the restaurant was so good we rarely ate out and the location was walking distance to most tourist attractions. The hammam was so relaxing I wish I‚Äôd done a few more through the week!    I wish Australia wasn‚Äôt so far away because I would definitely call this home away from home but with all the luxuries. Try the lamb tagine and the dessert plate... it was spectacular. I could go on... but you should try it all for yourself.    Thank you Jardins de la Medina... you have my loyalty and if we ever make it back to Marrakech (inshallah) I will be back to see you all.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Philmar501

Les Jardins de la Medina,John J wrote a review Jul 2018,50,"Wonderful hotel, wonderful staff",There is not enough room to detail all the great things about this hotel! We knew we were in for a great experience when we pulled up to the door at midnight after a long flight from the US and lost luggage from the airline and were greeted by a smiling and friendly concierge and bellman who got us quickly checked in and situated. The room was beautiful with a porch attached where we had morning coffee and a private rooftop deck that overlooked the Medina. The grounds were meticulously kept with lush vegetation a beautiful outdoor patio for dining and a great pool. Others have said this and we agree the hotel is like an oasis in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the Medina. It was only a 10 minute walk to the central square and then on into the markets so the hotel is perfectly located. But the best part of the hotel was the staff. Wonderful wonderful people! The concierges helped us with reservations recommendations day trips and transportation and all of their suggestions were spot on. Late afternoons by the pool were great as the staff brought us different snacks as we drank our wine and AIT (our favorite) even made me a special home remedy when I told him I wasn‚Äôt feeling well. Every person we encountered from the hotel was pleasant helpful and genuinely delightful to deal with. Early in our stay the hotel arranged for a taxi for us from that point on our taxi driver Noureddine made it his personal mission to take care of us. He would take us to restaurants and excursions and made sure that he was right there to take us back when we finished. He also acted as our informal tour guide and provided some great restaurant recommendations. A great ambassador for the hotel and the City! This hotel and its people made our trip to Marrakech a delight and we will absolutely stay here again the next time we are in Marrakech!

If you didn‚Äôt know it was there you would miss this oasis in the outskirts to city. Once checked in we offered a welcome mint tea while the team did the final touches to the room.    The room was comfortable and the amenities clean and appropriate for the standard of the hotel. Warning not the hotel‚Äôs fault but when throwing open the windows remember the mosquitoes. We had a garden room so could walk straight out towards the pool (heated) which had a small patio area which was perfect for those early evening drinks that the team were more than happy to bring to your room.    The break was more to relax that go discovering (we did some of the latter) so we took full advantage of the hotel.    Simply the food is awesome. As a fully accredited carnivore I was spoilt for choice and to be honest my wife who leans to a less protein intense diet was more than happy with the selection. The teams who manage the breakfasts lunch and dinner servings are brilliant courteous and efficient. Good food served by an organised team in very pleasant surroundings just made experience what we needed and had hoped for...fantastic.

In the old town it was a little oasis of tranquility embedded with the hustle and bustle of the town.    The contrast between being used inside and outside is amazing. Lovely grounds rooms terraces set around a lovely pool. It is said this little palace was once owned/built for a prince and you can well imagine that.    Staff were fab some of the most hospital I have met in all my travels around the globe. Really personable and nothing was too much. I am really grateful to them for making or stay so special. Good buffet for breakfast and good quality lunches and dinners at a reasonable price.    Hotel is 15 min walk from the main square and souk and there is plenty to see along the way. Locals go about there daily business and lives and hardly seem to notice the tourist who tend to stick out in the crowds. Some of the traffic (motor bikes) can be a little crazy but generally safe.

It‚Äôs location on the edge of the kasbah and just 10 minutes walk from the sook was ideal. It really is a tropical calming wonder when you walk in from the street and the staff are without exception welcoming and attentive. They can not do enough for you and the welcome party held every Friday evening with free drinks and nibbles was a nice touch!    Whilst it can get busy by the pool and not all loungers are in the sun I found the roof terrace to be the perfect escape. Quiet and a sun trap!    The rooms are spacious and always kept spotless. I would like to have had free tea and coffee in the room considering this is not a cheap place to stay but that is a small criticism. The breakfast was varied enough and filling but I felt the lunch and dinner menus were slightly limited and if we had choose to eat in more often or were staying longer then this may have been a problem. Most days we ate out and there is plenty of choice for this in and around the kasbah.    Overall this is a great riad relaxing clean and with great facilities. I would definitely consider staying here again if I return to Marrakech.,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/673nishag
Les Jardins de la Medina,Chris F wrote a review Mar 2018,40,Great hotel which could be even better,We very much enjoyed our stay at the hotel. The staff are always friendly and helpful. We stayed for 10 nights so had a good opportunity to assess the facilities. Our room was comfortable and clean. We preferred a room which was not on the ground floor as it is more private and we felt safer. The hotel make a big thing at the welcome about choosing an oil to be used in the room. The reality is a little disappointing as the aroma soon disappeared after it was used in the evenings. Better to give some oil for the guests to use themselves. The dining room is impressive and the dinner menu was fine. But we did not feel that it was a ‚Äòfive star‚Äô breakfast which was a bit disappointing with a lack of choice. Outside of the hotel in the medina you could get any type of fresh fruit juice which was not expensive. For some reason the hotel could only offer fresh orange juice and we felt that they should offer more choice. My final gripe is about the arrangements for tea and coffee which you could make in your room. Whilst tea bags were available each day the coffee was less forthcoming. Each room has a capsule coffee maker and you get given three ‚Äòfree‚Äô coffees (one of which is decaf). If you want more coffee you have to pay about 250 dirhams for each capsule/cup. Even then the machine only makes a very small cup. Considering that most guests only seem to stay for two or three nights I don‚Äôt suppose most people care but we were there for longer and a consideration would have been nice. Alternatively the hotel could have provided instant coffee sachets at little cost. Maybe the primarily ‚ÄòFrench‚Äô clientele would disapprove. Anyway we ended making our own coffee at cost!  However I would be happy to recommend the hotel to anyone visiting Marrakech. Coming back to the hotel is bliss after the cacophony and fumes in the medina!

Les Jardins de la Medina,Suzan H wrote a review Mar 2018,50,Fabulous hotel,We have just returned from a few days in Marrakech and feel so lucky we picked Les Jardins de la Medina as our base. So much so we would definitely stay there again and are dreaming of a return visit.  It is true that the location is at the edge of the Medina but the Kasbah area is historic and we were happy to head back there every day after exploring further afield.  The lush gardens of the hotel surrounding the pool and filling the inner courtyard make it a perfect place to find a quiet private spot no matter how many people are around.  The pool is lovely and our room overlooking it was exactly what we wanted. I was glad to find we had our own private terrace and access to the roof for sunbathing although the weather for our last 2 days meant we couldn't make the best use of those facilities but we can't blame the hotel for that.  The staff were very welcoming and helpful at all times. When we returned from being caught in the rain one young man made a point of lighting the fire in the bar area and insisting we move to two chairs he placed in front of it so we could dry off as we drank our mint tea. Bless him.  Breakfast was gorgeous - so much choice plentiful and fresh the coffee was excellent too. In fact the food at the hotel was the best we had the whole time we were in Marrakech - we may book half or full board next time we go!  We decided to have one last lunch just before leaving for our plane home and the monkfish kebab and Paris Brest desert were absolutely delicious.  The beauty of Marrakech is that you have no idea what is hidden behind any high wall or ornate door and I am sure there are many many delightful places tucked out of sight across the Medina but I got a real thrill everytime we stepped from the street into the welcoming reception of Les Jardins de la Medina and then through into the tropical oasis courtyard beyond.

There is something special about the atmosphere the exotic scents the wood fires evening music fountain the traditional lighting that make a stay extremely relaxing and comfortable. Beds are a dream. A true oasis of calm in the noisy dusty Medina. Small enough to feel intimate large enough to have a good restaurant and a lovely pool and garden. Since we were there in 2017 some redecoration and upgrading of common areas has taken place and it looks as if a new spa area is being created. If you are going ask the hotel to book Fast Track at the airport both ways.

As the hotel are adding more rooms on the rooftop to maximize there product. Sadly we were only off peak unimportant guests and do not even merit being told of these works the noise dust or inconvenience to our morning lie In or sun worship on the rooftop.  To continue these works saturday and sunday mornings i thought was a bit too much and my enquiries at reception met with Gallic shrugs in that imperious french manner as if it was of little consequence. No apology no complimentary drink .!  This i think is a great shame to ruin anyones stay  as the whole courtyard with the orange trees in the garden surrounding the pool is beautiful and relaxing. The restaurant with the fires blazing is lovely on a cool winter night and the food on offer is excellent.  Also they seem to have changed all the beds to errr... an extremely firm model with little give.

Really great room with plenty of space and great views from the balcony over the garden/swimming pool. I do not think I have every stayed in such a huge bed and it was a nice touch to have a choice of perfume for the pillows every night. Staff were friendly and provided excellent customer service in all aspects of the hotel/restaurant.

Our room facilities were explained to us we were very taken with the rose petal welcome and both the temperature and aroma of the room. The room had real character with its raised bedroom area and authentic decoration the heated bathroom floor was an additional welcome luxury. The concierge and his team couldn't have been more helpful how nice it was too to meet the management team in an informal drinks and canopes evening event.

We will come back.. The hotel was wonderful a haven away from the hustle and bustle of the city.

Les Jardins de la Medina,srg105 wrote a review Jan 2018,50,Wonderful stay in Marrakesh!,We visited in December. Pretty cold in the evenings and the mornings. But nice during the day.    Airport - you need to fill out a landing card. Took us nearly 2 hours to leave the airport and everyone has to get their suitcase x-rayed before leaving the airport...    We were met by the lovely Omar. He explained a bit about Marrakesh and advised us on things to do. The journey was in a nice spacious mini-van and took around 15 minutes to get to the Medina.    Very warm welcome on arrival and while the front desk sorted our rooms etc. we were given lovely Moroccan tea and a refreshing face towel.    Our room was at the back of the hotel but was easily accessible by the walk ways and there is also an elevator.    Rooms are spacious well-maintained and well-equipped. We asked for an extra radiator and covers and they were delivered within 10 minutes.    Really nice outdoor area heated pool and gardens. There is also an outside gym!!  Everywhere is spotlessly clean.    We had a wonderful hammam and scrub with the lovely Ghizlane. I would definitely recommend it!! My brother also enjoyed him haircut and shave.    There are lots to see and do near the Medina. Lots of local shops etc.  Do try one of their local patties. DELICIOUS.  A  About 10 minutes‚Äô walk from the Medina is a wonderful artisanal shop. If you want to avoid the crowds of the main square it is worth a visti.    The famous square is a short taxi ride away or around 25 by foot. Worth a visit. Go early! Worth a visit at night too!    Just across the street is the Clock Cafe - go there for some lunch or just a drink. Try the almond milkshake! SOOOOOOOO GOOD. They have a beautiful terrace and great food. We also did some henna there and a great cooking class.    Now to the Medina itself. The staff are amazing and the food is great. Cannot praise them enough.    Breakfast: Lots of choice and fresh orange juice. Chef will make you some eggs too.    Lunch: Great variety too. Try the house cocktail. Soooo good.    Dinner: We were half board. Food was amazing. Real compliments to the chef and her team.  Starter - tempura prawns - yum. Avocado - yum.  Main - veal curry - delicious. Tagina - soo good. Lamb chops - delicious.  Dessert - All amazing.    Really nice place to stay and great location. Worth a visit.    A few people I would like to thanks for amazing customer service and for their kindness towards myself and my family.

First impression: smallish foyer but then we were whisked the into the gorgeous Bar / Restaurant area where there was a roaring fire as it was evening and starting to turn cold. We were offered tea and pastries on arrival. It's a beautiful Restaurant / Bar area which reminded me of Tuscany in so many ways: the roaring fire the terracotta floors the fabulous wooden ceiling. We had dinner there a number of times and the food was top class and reasonably priced. Service was very good. Breakfast was also excellent. The fresh orange juice is simply unbelievable. This hotel is near enough to the Souks to be able to walk there but far enough away not to be bothered by noise. We slept very well. The staff were friendly professional and very helpful. Everything was spotlessly clean the rooms were comfortable. We had a fire in ours which we took advantage of on a number of occasions. The gardens are beautiful as is the heated pool. I had a massage which was excellent for a very reasonable price. I did this late in the stay if I had done it earlier I would have booked more!! They had a guitarist every night in the bar area and on one occasion a couple of great musicians in the restaurant which we really really enjoyed. On another occasion they had cocktails with a magician who was great. Basically: we will be back. Well done to all the staff and thank you for a lovely stay.

Les Jardins de la Medina is a 5 star hotel which provide real hotel services in a old traditional riad. You can stay in the heart of the medina and you can see real life of Marrakech people.    Our room was decorated very well and it was really good it has good beds and beautiful terrace but I think some things must be changed:    1- In a 5 star hotel famous toiletry amenities is a must. But here hotel's house keeping just fill shampoo shower gel and body milk in the glass bottles and you won't know what you are using.    2- Room's TV is very ordinary and there are not very choices    3- Hotel in-room coffee was not updated daily and when we asked for more they said it is done just once for your stay. It was a good brand coffee (illy) but I can't accept that a hotel with price of 220 euro per night don't update little thing like coffee.    Les Jardins de la Medina has a very beautiful pool in the center of Garden that is always busy and hotel's guests enjoyed it very much.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Finchbee wrote a review Nov 2017,40,Nice place for your First Marrakesh experience.,Nice check-in experience and tasteful authentic spotless rooms. Good breakfast choice and plenty of options to relax at either the pool or on the roof terrace. Dinner menu is a little bit limited but all very well prepared.

Les Jardins de la Medina,elizabeth e wrote a review Nov 2017,50,Forget the riads-stay here!,An Oasis!!! We stayed in Marrakech for 3 days before and 2 days after a Sahara tour. I found the Riads charming when researching and booked one for the 3 days. It was interesting but too quiet the pool was not used and it was just quirky. I felt like a house guest that the riad kept tabs on. After being exhausted from the heat and dirt of the desert we splurged and stayed at Les Jardins...seriously it seemed like walking into an oasis compared to the hustle and bustle of the city. It has everything you expect. We had a gorgeous romantic room with a terrace and dined at the restaurant. Breakfast was delicious especially the Moroccan pancakes with honey and almond syrup and fresh oj. The best thing about this place (compared to riads) is the large pool and gardens. We were tired of sightseeing so we lounged around in the sun and our room. However the location is within the medina and very walkable to Bahia palace and jma el fnaa square. I would recommend having the experience of a riad but come here before heading home to relax and recharge. Worth the money to have the comforts of home.,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Toronto, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethe468

From the moment we arrived the reception and indeed all the staff were at all times welcoming helpful and friendly. I hope it is ok to single out the diligent and charming Yahya(sp?) in particular. Our room was spacious pristine and very well prepared each day with thoughtful touches such as fresh water rose petals on the bed etc being very well received. Al fresco Breakfast each morning was excellent and the evening meals we had in the restaurant or indeed mostly outside by the pool were superb without exception. All in all a 10/10 experience.

The bedroom on the ground floor was spacious very comfortable and beautifully furnished. Nice touches included a complementary bottle of wine and complementary daily newspapers.

We stayed in a mini suite which had ample space a large garden facing balcony and was well equipped and very quite considering the close proximity to the centre of the town. The pools were nice albeit the large patio pool was rather cold but the roof top pool was lovely. It was disappointing to find out that you had to pay 200DH to use the indoor pool and that should really be included.  Restaurants and cafe very good. Breakfast was plentiful in the surrounding gardens.  Rooms well kept with abundance of fresh roses each day.  Highly recommend this little oasis on a short break.

We had one lunch and one dinner both of which were excellent with a good choice of Moroccan food. The pool area was lovely with lots of natural shade and the pool was immaculate. A feature of the hotel was the choice of places to relax including roof terraces a bar area and among the trees.

Les Jardins de la Medina,StephR2 wrote a review Oct 2017,30,Underwhelming,The reviews on Les Jardins de la Medina are somewhat misleading. The Riad is quirky to say the least!  The first impressions are good beautiful oasis away from the madness of the Kasbah.  I‚Äôd like to highlight though that there is massive room for improvement in terms of customer service.    There was a complimentary drinks party held by the management during our stay. For some reason we never received an invitation and only found out about it ten minutes prior to it commencing. One assumes this is due to the fact we were two unaccompanied women. This was also noticeable when we either sat in the bar area or during meals. If there was a male present staff were far more attentive. We also pay the final account!    Food generally good although rather expensive. Prawn tempura 120MAD for four prawns!  On one occasion I was served a kitchen sponge along with my spring rolls! No apology given or discount just an explanation. Coffee accidentally poured over me at breakfast. No apologies for this either. Staff need to work on the observational skills and dexterity.    The room was adequate beds are comfortable. Pillows too soft but that‚Äôs probably more a personal issue. Cleaning could be improved.  Received a part used toilet roll one evening from a member of staff. Shower gel was not replenished and other bathroom items also not restocked. Maybe stock control is an issue? Towels are too small and generally poor quality.    Obviously there is a problem with drainage in this Riad. Perhaps a plumber required rather than choosing a room scent to mask the smell.    Advertising a gym is somewhat misleading. Three pieces of equipment in the garden!    Lack of information given on checking in. We were not told anything about times meals were served. No information given regarding check out time. Information regarding local tourist attractions and a map would be extremely useful.    Not on my recommended list!,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StephR2

The riad has a good restaurant a bar with a terrace where you can relax on an evening but is also within walking distance of the old town should you want to explore.    The staff were very helpful and friendly and there is a good concierge service who are happy to book restaurants and organise trips many of which we found to be cheaper than the same trip found online.    The riad also has a spa offering hammam massages facials etc. We had a massage twice and found it to be very relaxing.    Couldn't fault our suite which was very comfortable and spacious.    One thing to mention is that we think it is less suitable for families with small children as most guests are couples and older groups looking for a quiet relaxing break.

We read some lovely reviews of this hotel and wanted to check out the facilities for next years BIG DAY. to which we will be returning to the area with over 20 guests as a wedding party. we stayed in the area to check out the many 5* hotels in the area for this occasion. We turned up one day to have lunch and use the facilites at the resort. We were a little surprised to held in reception while they checked the pool availabliity as there was literally NO one at the pool. we were expecting to have lunch to use the facilities and this was fine. we were happy to pay for this. and initially all was fine a beautiful looking hotel with lovely gardens like an oasis in the middle of the hustle and bustle. we thought we had found the place we would be returning to. we enjoyed lunch and the use of the pool. We did feel a little uneasy only by the glares we received from a few of the staff...im guessing as we were day visitors. anyway we decided to return the next day as we enjoyed ourselves and wanted to check now on availability for next year. ....to our surprise we were met by a very stuck up and rude woman on the front desk who looked at us like trash. we were then told we could not use the facilites again and they were full??? strange. again pool area empty.! she said we could have lunch but nothing more. we felt very looked down upon and unwelcome. Im so glad we went back this time and met this awful woman or we may of booked here and been let down next year.

The hotel is quite small (only 36 rooms) and has a very boutique feel to it. We stayed in one of the 'patio' rooms which was spacious and immaculately kept throughout our stay. The bed was enormous and very comfortable. The hotel staff also decorated the room with rose petals daily making it a very couple orientated hotel.    The pool was beautiful and very serene. Plenty of shade provided by the palm trees surrounding the pool but also spots of sun. There are also various secluded spots around the hotel if you wanted more privacy.    The hotel is located about a 20 minute walk from the Medina and is away from the madness of the Souks. Taxis are reasonably priced if you want to go further afield and the hotel staff were very helpful in booking these.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Neil C wrote a review Aug 2017,50,"Beautiful Gardens. Hard to believe it exist so close to the mad rush of Marrakech Medina, Souqs etc","Spent a lovely morning here and even though popular and busy it was so peaceful and calm compared to the rush of the souqs on previous day. Well worth a visit. Stopped and just sat in shade and watched the world go by. Had a drink in the cafe and but got some lunch in a restaurant just 2 mins walk outside the gardens at Pause Gourmand which was very good.    Tip for taxi in case you need one. We took a taxi from our Riad in .Medina and paid 30 MAD to get there. To get a return back my tip is do not waste your time with the Taxi drivers at the garden entrance. The taxi drivers there started with 100 MAD to go back. I am fine for this to be the standard negotiating start price but three times I agree a price of 40 MAD as I was happy to accept they pay for some parking while they wait but each time the driver dumped us as we walked to car his while he tried a different customer alking put of gardnens.    So we just walked away to the T junction and picked up a taxi on road who had just dropped off custom rs. I got it for 40 MAD but could probably have push d harder but it was very hot and wanted to get going. We still had to haggle for price up front and once I walked away thIs taxi called me back and agreed my ""dernier prix"" of 40 MAD.",Date of stay: August 2017,,St. Albans,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NeilC136

Les Jardins de la Medina,Peterb2012London wrote a review Jun 2017,50,An oasis,From reading previous reviews it is possibly a clich√© to say that this hotel is the epitome of peace and quiet away from the hustle bustle and heat of Marrakech.  The welcome is warm and friendly and the accommodation luxurious and spacious.  Room service is attentive with an evening turndown.  The restaurant and pool area is an oasis and a relaxing place to sit.  Breakfast has a reasonable choice and service is good  The dinner menu is varied and the food excellent.  There is also a good drinks and wine list.  The one slight negative was that service was a little slow in the evenings both for drinks and dinner although Ramadam may have been an influencing factor.  During the day there is the opportunity to relax by the pool although the extent of the foliage does mean that there can be a surplus of shade.  For trips excursions and taxis reception provides a comprehensive and helpful service.  Overall the staff accommodation and grounds make this a gem of a hotel.,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Peterb2012London

Les Jardins de la Medina,Terry S wrote a review May 2017,50,Superb Marrakech Hotel,We arrived relatively late in the evening but still received a very warm welcome and were told not to panic about dinner they would serve us when we were ready. This calm and gentle welcome was just the start of an amazing five days at this fantastic Hotel.    We dined on two evenings and one luncheon at the Hotel unheard of for us as normally the food is either mediocre or very expensive. The food was fabulous beautifully presented fresh tasty interesting and very good value.    We'd like to single out members of staff but there isn't space as they were all fabulous attentive but discreet and not overbearing friendly but professional. Our French is not great but that didn't cause a problem. Most front of house staff speak excellent English and if they don't understand some complex request they aren't afraid to get someone else who does speak perfect English.    The room was beautiful the Hotel beautiful the gardens beautiful alright I'm using the same words over and over but I just can't rate the whole experience high enough.    True it is not really cheap probably certainly not for Marrakech but compared to British prices this is a five star top London Hotel for a Motel price!    The location is at the Southern end of the Kasbah so not that central but only a fifteen minute walk on the flat to the main square. However that does mean that when you return from the mad hustle and bustle of Marrakech to the calm quiet tranquillity of the gorgeous gardens you really appreciate the peace.

I am a pure vegetarian so having savoury breakfast of different veg  beans tomatoes cheese and fresh fruit juices was excellent . We were fortunate to get a good deal for 3 days otherwise probably too expensive for us but I really hope we can return . It was our 10 th anniversay treat  very romantic and so enjoyed relaxing and reading around the lovely pool . I loved the fresh roses everywhere and choice of perfume for your room . They clean and tidy the room at least twice a day !! There is a bar and good restaurant too. Being in the Kasbah was a bit more relaxed than in the medina . Cafe Cloak is just around the corner for veg choices etc and is fun . The only thing I didnt like was the false grass by pool and terrace . Please get rid of it !

There are lots of quirky seating areas to avoid the heat and a roof top terrace for sun lovers. The swimming pool is a little small for exercise but nice to sit around and order snacks or drinks. The restaurant food is good but a bit limited after 3 days.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Gary L wrote a review May 2017,40,Biggest Ryad in Marrakech,My wife and I stayed one night prior to departure having stayed the previous week in another riad in Marrakech and in the Atlas mountains.  Very attractive gardens and surroundings and the deluxe room was excellent with a complimentary bottle of wine (although the shower drainage was blocked).  Overall this is more of a westernised riad and a halfway house between a normal hotel and traditional riad and probably suitable for those who want to be gently introduced to the Moroccan culture.    The only disappointment was the dinner which was a fixed price four course set menu so no choice and you paid the same whether you had one or four courses. The menu was relatively expensive.The courses were skimpy to say the least and relatively unappetising. The dining room staff were surly and slow and seemed to be arguing amongst themselves at times. One could not help but think that things were not happy in the background. Even if the staff have disagreements it is unprofessional to let the clients see them.  Having said this by contrast the front of house staff and management were very friendly and helpful..  The breakfast and lunch the following day were good. So maybe the dinner chef had an off day.    The hotel was very accommodating as the check out was 12.00 mid-day and the taxi pickup for the airport was at 7.30pm. We stayed around the pool at the hotel and had shower and changing facilities for when we finally left.  Because we like to experience more of the traditional culture we would probably stay in a traditional riad next time. However this would suit those who like a more western feel.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Kingsbridge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Garycluer
Les Jardins de la Medina,AideenY wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Gorgeous oasis,I bought a cheap Easyjet holiday to Marrakech - flights and 3 nights at the Riad Africa for 2 people for approx ¬£430! And although everything was fine and the hotel was clean it just wasn't beautiful and in Marrakech you need beauty. Marrakech is a fascinating place but let's be honest the beauty is all to be found behind closed doors behind high walls. You need to know where it is and when you find it it takes your breath away but if you don't now where you're going and just wander Marrakech aimlessly you won't t come away and say it's beautiful.    And so we moved to the Jardins de la Medina and had beauty aplenty. It was a little further away from the Djemaa el Fna than Riad Africa had been and it was just that bit more pleasant in the surrounding streets. But the hotel itself is simply gorgeous. A total refuge from the madness in the city beyond. The pool is gorgeous; there is a beautiful roof top terrace from which you can see the Atlas mountains. The food was fantastic. I think that it is very important to have this type of refuge while in Marrakech. It's kind of crazy out there and it made all the difference to my view of the city that I had this luxury and beauty to retreat to after hours walking around in the medina.    We had a beautiful room with two terraces; one just outside our room and a second up some stone steps with a hammock. Just blissful.

Les Jardins de la Medina,James L wrote a review Mar 2017,50,Excellent short break in Marrakech,This hotel is an old Riad built for a prince many years ago but even with modernisation it has maintained many of the old features.  The rooms were spacious we had a garden room with a little court yard sitting area which was shaded and just off the bedroom and a further sun area up some steps with a view over the whole Riad. We did not try the pool as the weather was a little cool when when the sun was out it was very pleasant on our roof.  The staff were fabulous couldn't have been more helpful. All of them were multi lingual so communication was not a problem. We had maid service to the room twice a day the latter visit was for a bed turn down and emptying the bins and the like.  Their was plenty to explore within the Riad with little knooks and crannies here and there. We were given a guided tour on out first day to orientate ourselves.  The Riad is about 30 minutes walk from the main square and it is all easy going as Marrkech is on the flat.  The breakfast and dining area was lovely with the ability to sit under an awning for breakfast and inside in the evening. When hotter an outside option is available as the tables were in place.  The Riad has 36 rooms around three sides of the building and didn't seem to be crowded even though all the rooms were occupied.  My only gripe is that the evening meal took to long in coming and I have no idea why as earlier in our stay the place ran like clockwork and we were not allowed to stay looking at empty plates for long. Toward the end of our stay the service in this part of the building needed to sharpen up.  Would I go again yes I would and my wife agrees but we would try and go a little later in the year say about late April to May. We would not want to go in the high summer as last year the temperatures rose to 45 pulse degrees Celsius and that's just too hot!  The Riad was quiet inside the high walls so road noise was not a problem.  A nice touch was that we were asked to chose a scent for our pillows out of choice of four. The room also had a incense burner in the bathroom which gave the room a fabulous smell which was not overpowering. It was the usual tea light candle variety.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Wells, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H3749YUjamesl

As we were celebrating a 'big' birthday the hotel very kindly upgraded us to the most stunning room with our own private terrace area free bottle of red wine and Moroccan 'nibbles'.  The hotel itself is amazing and a pure piece of heaven away from the hustle and bustle that is Marrakech. It was a delight to return to this sanctuary of chirping birds scent of jasmine and gentle sound of the fountain after the chaos of the main centre. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. Nothing is too much trouble for them. The ladies on the reception (sorry but I don't know their names!) were particularly helpful and very professional.  The hotel even has a few tortoises which wander up and down the garden area...watch out for the smaller one as he gets about and is particularly speedy!!

Les Jardins de la Medina,genyf0ster wrote a review Mar 2017,50,A lovely garden hotel,Situated in the Kasbah the entrance is doorway set into the wall of a narrow street. Entering into a reception area you are given a warm welcome. Formalities over we were ushered into the bar area and supplied with small cups of milk and dates mint tea followed shortly. One lovely touch was the choosing of the linen spritz.    The bar and restaurant looks out onto a beautiful lush garden area which really is an oasis. There is a heated swimming pool with plenty of loungers. Our room was big and airy with a small balcony.    The bathroom was huge laid out beautifully with rose petals scattered on the towels with an excellent shower    The restaurant is divided into a more formal area and a more relaxed garden/conservatory area. The lunch menu has a good selection of dishes the pear pine nut and chicken tagine was wonderful    The more formal men of the evening has a combination of Moroccan dishes and international choices. The one evening meal we had was good but more expensive than other restaurants of a similar standard.    The service in the bar and restaurant was polite professional and very attentive.    Housekeeping was of a high quality as was the maintenance of the garden areas.    Breakfast buffet included a delicious selection of fruits fresh orange juice and a hot station if you want eggs pancakes or omelette.    There was is a beauty centre (try the argon oil pedicure blissful).    The WIFI was excellent and available everywhere in the hotel.    The hotel arranged for a guide for a tour through the Medina and souk together with taxis.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Mel B wrote a review Feb 2017,40,Oasis of calm,Very nice hotel a little quirky in a good way. Calm and peaceful atmosphere and nice pool area for a city hotel. Restaurant was good but very pricey compared to others around. However there were no other quality restaurants on the doorstep. Clockwork Cafe is 1 minute walk good food but as the name suggests more cafe like. Kasbah Cafe was 5 mins away. If you're looking for restaurant style food its a good 10/15 minutes walk or go to one of the other nearby Riads.    The walk to the main square is around 15 minutes (Mosque 10 mins) and the road you walk up can be a bit intimidating at first if you walk up in the evening but once you get used to it its all ok and nothing to worry about. Mind out for cars and bikes which zoom around.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Corvus corax wrote a review Feb 2017,20,Disappointing for dinner,I'm not crazy about this place. We booked for dinner on our first night in Marrakech on this visit (we've been often before though not to this restaurant/hotel). When booking we received a stern but fair response that if we were going to be late we must tell them. This would have been fair enough if they were expecting us. Despite our booking we got no sense that they were. Rather we had to order a drink at the bar and then were forgotten. Forty minutes later we had to find a waitress to ask for a table. We were seated then forgotten again.    We had one course each only. I ordered a dish of potatoes layered with cod. It was edible just but amazingly it contained neither potatoes nor cod. The carbs instead were supplied by a kind of pancake which was OK if a little cold except that it tasted as though it was cooked in oil that was turning rancid. The fish - there WAS some fish unlike the phantom potato - was a white fish probably freshwater. It was certainly not cod (I eat a lot of fish and know my gadoids). I think it was probably catfish - in the U.K. often called River Cobbler - or tilapia. I should have sent it back but I was famished and by then it was late.    We chose some good wine and my companion was reasonably happy - only reasonably mind - with her food.    Would I go again? For a drink maybe. Not for dinner. Service was poor food worse than poor and the menu a downright lie.,Date of stay: February 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Argyll and Bute, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/misc_nonsense

We thought at first that it was just a restaurant then realised that it was also a hotel.    We had one of the best meals that we havwe had for a long time. It was one of those meals were evry mouthful was bliss and you just did not want it to end.    Amongst the palm tree and garden is a beautiful pool gym and spa.

Les Jardins de la Medina,aschoc wrote a review Jan 2017,50,A relaxing oasis in the Medina,"Spent an amazing 5 days here on a last minute getaway. First time in Morocco so decided to have a little treat in case Marrakech was as crazy as some reviews made out. On arrival there is just a door onto a street as many riads in the Medina are but once you get through it is as if you are transported to another world. You a warmly welcomed with a sweet milk some pastries hot towel and your first taste of mint tea. As our flight arrived so early our room was not ready but we were allowed into another room to get changed and relax at the pool with all our belongings moved into our actual room once ready. We had a solarium room with a private balcony and room terrace - if you like to sunbathe this is the perfect room as with the pool being in the centre of the complex it was in the shade by mid-afternoon but with the roof terrace there was an extra couple of hours of sun to catch. The gardens are lush and it really feels like an oasis and the pool is a large treat. We needed a twin room (which any of the rooms can be converted into) although the housekeeper often put the beds back together. Breakfast contained a great selection of pastries and other items including amazing orange juice and interesting other fresh juices. We also had dinner one night and the food was delicious. All the staff were fantastic with just the right level of friendly attentivness. Location wise you're a 15 - 20 min walk to the main square (Jeema-al-Fna) and close by many of the other sights. You will get lost on multiple occasions and hassled by people trying to show you for money or sell you stuff. It can be helpful to have a walking tour to help orientate you although be warned you end up being taken in a number of ""markets"". But no matter how crazy it is outside the hotel it all seems to melt away once you get through the door.

Les Jardins de la Medina,ROUNDSPRING wrote a review Dec 2016,30,"Great Location, Poor Service",Visited at end of November. Got v cheap deal with British Airways Holidays. Location just 15 mins by taxi from the airport (15 Euros). This does however mean that when you are enjoying the beautiful gardens you can hear airplane noise. Lots of building work going on next door which I couldn't hear from my room but was v loud in other parts of the building ie the hammam. Food was limited but good and the wine local and interesting but pricey. The bulding set around a lovely shaded courtyard with a central pool were a wonderful oasis from the craziness that is the Kasbah and Medina. Everything is within walking distance. I took a walking guide on the first day which was v interesting and hassle free. However venturing out after that you must be prepared for hawkers motorbike kids and the ever present groups of men on street corners. Being a woman on your own this could prove a bit overwhelming but I live in London and it was no worse than Oxford St at Xmas. Everyone is trying to make a dollar out of you. Tourism is the second largest income for Morocco - so try to be understanding.    The service in general at the hotel was quite poor. The reception staff distracted and a bit surly. There was a discounted offer at the Hammam between 10 and 3pm. The times got changed during my visit and although I wasn't informed reception tried to insist I pay the higer price. I stood my ground and was eventually reluctantly offered an extra 20 mins massage.Waiting staff at breakfast and dinner were disinterested and disappeared very quickly so it was not possible to order after dinner drinks. Had I not visited at a quiet time and on a special deal I would feel much more cheated.

It is really a little oasis in the hustle a bussle of the old Kasbar. The room we had was large well furnished and warm but no balcony. The hotel loves roses! There were red rose petals all over the place and put on the bed and bathroom every day. It was a nice touch to get the sweets on arrival and roses but these were not replaced during the week! The roses looked very tired! There is water in the room.    We were there a week and our biggest disappointment was the food given this was advertised as a gourmet restaurant with a cookery school. . Breakfast was adequate but limited  tea and coffee terrible. There are eggs on offer but these were tasteless and it took about three requests to get boiled eggs one morning However the service was very friendly if a bit erratic ! We only ate in the restaurant for one evening and hoping for something special. We ate well in Marrakech and I am sorry but we agreed that this meal was the worst we had. Mediocre at best. At over double what would be paid outside the hotel we did not eat there again.  I had a massage in the hotel spa which was quite good and the price I would expect to pay in the UK.

I thought it was still pricey considering I originally paid for a room that fits four and we only ate their free breakfast one day.    Overall we enjoyed our stay. The staff was nice and the courtyard was well kept. I loved all the orange trees there. There was also a pool but it was too cool this time of year to go swimming.

Les Jardins de la Medina,LittleFox2000 wrote a review Nov 2016,50,Wonderful Oasis of calm on the Edge of the Medina,What a wonderful hotel this is! You arrive through the tiny narrow dusty streets in the Kasbah district of the old city and step out in front of a wooden door in the red walls...it opens and you step through into the beautifully decorated lobby. One of our guides mentioned that the hotel once used to be a palace now converted into this tranquil hotel. (It's beautiful...so whether it's true or not I believed him) There are just 36 rooms set around gardens and a pool. There's a hammam on site and a spa. The restaurant is also one of the top restaurants for fine dining in the city. The food is a good mix of options spanning the more traditional Moroccan fayre to French gastro takes on the local food. It was a delicious experience although I should probably save my comments for a separate review on the restaurant.    Our room was large and airy and perfectly set up for the weary traveller; bottled water rose petals everywhere all manner of hotel toiletries and amenities. It even boasted its own little terrace. You can also sit up on the higher levels enjoy a drink and look out towards the Altas mountains.    We took a hammam and massage and it was such a wonderful experience. I think I'm a hammam convert and would love to find somewhere at home where I could do this regularly.    I really loved this hotel...having done a significant amount of travel and hotel living over the past 3 months this place came as a blessed relief from the large chains.

We had a solarium room which had its own sun terrace - with a couple of sun beds on it. We really liked this as towards the late afternoon the sun disappears from the pool area and we could watch the sun go down. Also great for star gazing after dinner. The pool area and gardens are lovely - keep an eye out for the tortoises! The food and staff were also great. Highly recommend this lovely hotel.,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Woburn Sands, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/randj06
Les Jardins de la Medina,Rairs wrote a review Oct 2016,40,Family holiday,Second visit to Marrakech but took my parents and sister this time. Small but beautiful traditional looking hotel. On arrival they greeted us with lovely dates and other Moroccan traditional snacks. The staff and manager were all so friendly. My wife and I were given a free upgrade without asking! Our bedroom was so spacious with a lovely garden view and a private terrace above! They left dried fruits and fresh fruits in our room. My family really likes their room too.  Beautiful gardens in the courtyard with birds singing and tortoises walking around. We all really enjoyed our breakfast- fresh eggs Moroccan pancakes and the most delicious fresh orange juice- and plenty of other foods! It was all buffet but they would happily come and serve us- which my elderly parents were really happy with.  Location was perfect too very near the square and most other places we wanted to visit.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Not_easily_pleased70 wrote a review Oct 2016,10,Poisoned,My husband and I contracted horrific food poisoning whilst staying at the hotel - we're almost certain from my lunch and his breakfast. 2 weeks on and we've still not completely recovered. Despite mentioning several times to the hotel staff that we were unwell no attempt was made to check on us or to assist with our recovery. After not getting any better after 5 days we ended up having to cut our holiday short and fly home early. Despite ruining the rest of our holiday we didn't ask for anything from the hotel other than to remove the lunch which we're sure made me ill from our bill - something we thought was more than reasonable. We didn't ask for any other reduction in the price of our miserable stay. This request was met with complete hostility and after a call to the manager they reluctantly agreed to remove the lunch food (but not the drinks...) from the bill - a small victory for them I suppose!

Les Jardins de la Medina,VanBC-Food-lover wrote a review Oct 2016,50,"Beautiful, intimate hotel in the Medina","Can't add much to other rave reviews about this Riad. Beautiful rooms and gardens. Excellent attentive service. Very friendly staff. Nice rooftop seating area with shower to cool you should the pool area become too busy. Pleasant little welcoming extras in the room like a plate of sweets sun hats and basket daily/nightly replenished supply of bottled water. Very comfortable beds. Even several television channels in English.  Restaurant was good - Morrocan wines available there were surprisingly good. There was a nice reception and tasting on the Wednesday night - Not certain if that's a weekly event.  As others have mentioned and some complained about there are many small birds flitting about at breakfast looking for crumbs - Important to make sure the covers are seated properly over the bread baskets! Staff clean the seats around the pool every night but certain ones do become soiled again by next mid-day. Given a choice as to whether we would prefer the hotel with or without the birds my wife and I would definitely choose ""with"" - Seems to add to the charm of the place.  There are exercise machines but only three a rowing machine stationary bike and stairmaster.  Location is in a very quiet area of the Medina the southern tip of the Kasbah. About a 20 minute walk to the Jemaa el fna. We walked there daily - Always seemed to be a much further walk back than heading out. Later in the week we stayed we would take a tuk-tuk back to the hotel - within the medina much faster to take a tuk-tuk than a regular cab. Note that cost at night is double.  Walking in the area at pretty much any hour seems safe - Always lots of people about. Only thing we were sometimes anxious about was the possibility of getting run over by one of the multitude of mopeds flying around. Exhaust fumes from those stinky things we won't miss.  Would like to add some advice for people who have never travelled to Marrakech before though. Have the hotel arrange for your pickup at the airport! Many of the airport taxi drivers would seem to be crooks getting you into their cabs for an agreed-upon price and then trying to extort a higher price. Have read that cab to Medina should be 100-150 dirham - Hotel-arranged probably in the 200 dirham range - Airport cabbies try to extort as much as 400 dirham - It's only a couple of miles from the airport to the Jemaa el fna. Better to pay the extra for hotel-arranged transportation than have to deal with aggressive negotiation with a cabbie as your first experience in Marrakech after a possibly-long flight in.",Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Vancouver, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VanBC-Food-lover

It really is a haven away from the hustle and bustle of the souks. We were welcomed on arrival with a lovely drink and some dates before being shown to our stunning bedrooms. Our rooms were towards the back of the Riad and were huge quiet and beautifully decorated. The Riad itself is very well cared for and lovingly appointed. Although it was sometimes difficult to get a sunbed the pool was gorgeous and tranquil perfect to relax in after a day walking round the city a 10 minute walk away. Dinner in the restaurant was superb I'd definitely recommend the lambshank tangia a local specialty. My only disappointment was that I didn't get to use the spa or hammam both of which had great reviews as they were fully booked for the entire 3 days. Book in advance if you don't want to miss out.

Each time we felt as if we were coming home. The riad a former residence of a member of royalty is simply designed in that clean and perfect Arabic style and all the rooms face the lush gardens and pool. The staff makes each guest feel so welcomed and cared about. I actually felt sad on our last day to say good bye. They helped us with everything renting a car keeping our bags airport transfer. Everything we needed they supplied with a smile. Our room with a comfortable bed lovely bathroom and balcony or patio was delightful. We slept so well. We woke to have Moroccan breakfast outside near the pool and twice we were there for weekly cocktail hour with wine appetizers music and magicians out by the pool. We also had dinner there twice or three times and they serve well-prepared Moroccan food and also cocktails and fine Moroccan wines.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Brian D wrote a review Sep 2016,20,Give a wide berth....,Arrived at the Riad late on a Saturday night we were booked in for a week's stay. Hotel is impressive and the rooms were excellent but it stops there... Tried the pool once but it was dirty with lots of bits of black stuff in it... Breakfast is adequate but has birds running over it constantly which is not hygienic.... And trying to find a chair to sit on without bird poo on it was a nightmare... Service is terrible lots of busy people running around but not doing anything this could do with a refresh of organisation.... We tried lunch once and while OK the cost was high and there are much better places to eat locally considerably cheaper..... Now dinner has a static menu and both things I ordered one was the lamb tangia needed to have been cooked longer I got much better not too far away at half the price as well as beer and wine at a much lower cost.... Overall I think this was a great place in the past but has gone down hill and much higher quality places to stay close by. It was annoying to have building work going on during our stay too without any warning. I would finalise this by stating it's over priced needs better organisation and a good clean!,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bedlington, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/150BrianD
Les Jardins de la Medina,Fred S wrote a review Sep 2016,50,classy with a personal touch,Stayed with my family in early September 16 for 3 days. Once you step through the door from what seems like an average narrow street you realise you in for a treat. Like most Riyads the structure has a central fountain and in this case a pool as well surrounded by a surprising number of trees. The place has been rightly described as an oasis as it is 5-8 degrees cooler than the outside thanks to the design which includes the water trees high ceilings and long corridors which somehow let the cool air circulate and hot air escape. The place feels retro stylish with grand ceilings arches and corridors. The rooms feel luxiourous and welcoming. There are fine touches including small pieces of furniture as if each room has been personalised. There was a warm welcome and staff were attentive knowledgable and relaxed which contributed to the ambience. Breakfast buffet was excellent with a wide choice though one has to share it with cheeky little birds who have made the garden their home. There was a problem as during our stay the hotel had to carry out repairs on the kitchen. However they made alternative arrangements including providing us with transport to a restaurant of our choice as well as complimentary entry to the local water park which would have probably cost us a 100 pounds. This was our first visit ti Marrakesh and whilst it is beautiful and exotic it can get hot busy and noisy with an overdose of hawkers  beggars and stray cats.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/51freds

A buffet style breakfast is available and is great al fresco shared with the local wildlife and tortoises at the pool! Orange and lime trees coupled with amazing jasmine plants produce lovely scents and much needed shade from the sun. We were upgraded on arrival and had our own patio and sun terrace. Room provisions were excellent and all you would expect and more from a 5 star hotel. We didn't try the hammam or fitness suite but they have a well stocked library of books available to borrow.

But,We ate here on a recent trip to Marrakech encouraged by good reviews and the fact that it waxs a stones throw from our own Riad - after a long day exploring on foot we felt we wanted to eat somewhere near.  We were welcomed by friendly staff and sat with a cocktail while choosing our food. The main dishes where not huge but tasted amazing and though pricey were good value. The desserts were not as good value and I would not recommend. Our biggest problem came with the wine they didn't have the bottle of rose we requested and offered us another showing it to us on the wine list - when the bill came we were pretty certain we had been charged more than double of what we expected to for the wine - maybe we had looked incorrectly when shown on the menu.

The hotel pool and tropical gardens are immaculately maintained and the staff welcoming and friendly without being intrusive. As we visited during Ramadan I think this must have had an impact on occupancy because there were few guests by the pool or in the restaurant by the end of our stay but this made no difference to the service provided by the staff.  Love Les Sens de Marrakech toiletries which are used throughout the hotel so luxurious and beautifully scented - bought some to take home from the hotel shop. Tried lunch by the pool a couple of times which we've not done before and can thoroughly recommend the Royal Prawn Tempura -large lightly crumbed butterfly prawns and the grilled meats with french fries. The amazing greenery gives a cooling micro-climate so if you want to sit away from direct sun under the trees you can do so all day.  Although we ate out one evening we enjoyed dinner on the other nights with a good choice and price range of main courses and at nightime the gardens take on a magical appearance.

Lovely quiet pool area but agree with other comments about people eating lunch having access to the pool area.

We wouldn't book it again because everybody who comes to lunch can also lay the entire day by the pool and enjoy the garden. That's the policy of almost every hotel with pool in Marrakech. We didn't have dinner or drinks in the hotel because of its high prices (higher than in Belgium)    The garden and pool are very nice and very welcoming on a hot day.    Breakfast was also okay but not breathtaking.

Les Jardins de la Medina,jcbnc wrote a review Jun 2016,50,Great deal and beautiful room,We were able to book a great deal for a garden room during the shoulder season in late Feb/early Mar that included a fruit/champagne offering and a hamman couples treatment. The room with the small patio and the rooftop loungers was beautiful quiet and well-appointed and having a large and refreshing garden within the medina was a tremendous bonus! We also had dinner one night as part of the package and enjoyed the mix of traditional Moroccan and French-influenced food. The breakfast was very plentiful and delicious and the hamman treatment really enjoyable. Overall we were really pleased with the location the food and drink selection the helpfulness of the staff and the ease of getting to the airport at the end of our stay. In addition the package deal made it a great value.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Durham, North Carolina",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcbnc
Les Jardins de la Medina,williewhittle wrote a review Jun 2016,50,Strongly recommend,Great location a tranquil retreat amongst the hustle and bustle. Jemma El Fnaa is only a brisk walk away. The beautiful garden surrounding the pool is a rare gem in a hectic city. The food was probably the highlight and likely due to the mostly French guests. The service was impeccable. Although not low cost for someone on a budget the value for money was outstanding. A comfortable yet authentic experience.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Tallulah-Muffkin wrote a review Jun 2016,50,"Fantastic gardens, lovely staff a real gem of a place",My husband booked this as a surprise for my birthday we stayed at Les Jardins de la Medina which is an authentic Riad within the Medina at the end of May 2016 for four days. We upgraded our room which was huge complete with a huge en suite bathroom. The room was sprinkled with rose petals there was a bottle of wine pastries fruit and water on our arrival - very romantic. The decor is very traditional all old terracotta tiles dark shutters outside private garden areas with water features etc. Our room had a lovely peaceful balcony overlooking the amazingly lush tropical style gardens. The pool area is so tranquil The staff were friendly and efficient with all aspects from drinks food service to concierge services.It was my birthday whilst we visited and they put candles all around the room with rose petals in a heart formation and flowers. We had a hamam treatment followed by a massage this was superb. Also during our stay we ate out at two restaurants and had two meals in the hotel both meals were of a very high standard. We can't recommend this place enough would definitely go back and since our return have spoken to other people who have visited and also gave the place high praise.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tallulah-Muffkin

Les Jardins de la Medina,Pudrey wrote a review May 2016,40,Lovely little hotel in good location,We were so glad we stayed in a Riad and not a commercial hotel. It was great to be in the Medina but hidden in a little tranquil oasis behind closed doors. The rooms were stylish and comfortable. We had supper in the hotel one night and the food and wine menu was excellent. We stayed in April and the weather was just warming up so we didn't experience any issues with the air-conditioning as other travellers have mentioned. For breakfast our party asked for eggs both mornings and they were happy to serve us. Small point the courtesy room isn't great try to extend your room stay if you need to on departure. Overall I'm not sure I would rate this hotel quite 5* UK standard equivalent. However we really enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel.,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Godstone, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pudrey
Les Jardins de la Medina,Andrew C wrote a review May 2016,20,Wouldn't stay there again!!,We stayed at the hotel last week for 6 days. The air conditioning did not work and the room became unbearably hot at night time. They told us they would fix it but never did.    The breakfast and lunch menu was very limited.    Most importantly one of our party had an upset tummy from a chicken dish and when we told them they could not care less. They never followed it up to see if we were okay.    Lastly the lady on the front desk was very miserable and was not very welcoming.    The area around the hotel is not very pleasant to walk round and taxi's struggle to get in and out of the area.    If I go to Marrakesh again I will stay in another hotel outside the Medina.,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewc109
Les Jardins de la Medina,Mik S wrote a review May 2016,30,"Beautiful Hotel, Not Worth the Price.",Stayed here for 6 nights the hotel is beautiful kept very well and quiet like a small oasis. However we were not told when booking that the air conditioning is only turned on in the summer and we were given a small portable unit which did not cool the room down when we had asked reception they said it was usually hot and they would turn it on. After a day or so of it not being on we went to reception to tell them it was not working to which we got an 'ok' from the receptionist the air con was never turned on and the room was very hot to sleep in. When you're paying that much money for a room you would expect working air conditioning. Secondly on the second to last day 3 of us had a Caesar Salad and we all got bad stomachs afterwards which had ruined what we had planned for our last day we told them at the restaurant to which they did not seem bothered.

We enjoyed two amazing nights with great sleep and service hospitality is here at the centre of attention. I would recommend taking couple of nights at riad of this type with ultra luxury hotel of the local 5* hotels (Royal Mansour La Sultana) to fill on for the rest of the stay and/or even with some really nice properties in Palmaraie (feels more resort like yet with some great restaurants).,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Prague, Czech Republic",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MilanP874
Les Jardins de la Medina,WatchysWayOut wrote a review Apr 2016,30,Very nice but not worth it outside the high season,Location is good the hotel is a 10 min walk to the Medina. The main attraction of the hotel is the lovely garden with heated swimming pool. There are quite a few loungers here as well as on the big roof top terrasse.    The outer wall used to be the medina wall they kept the holes in the wall so the birds could nest there. The staff will tell you the story when they show you around. There are resident tortoises that wander around the gardens and visit the patios in front of the rooms.    There's lots of shade from the trees around the pool so the hotel is a very good choice in the hot as hell summer months when it's hard to make do without a pool. However for a mid-March trip we came away feeling that it was way overpriced. 300‚Ç¨ a night is big money for Marrakech and it just didn't live up to our expectations of the 4/5star cost. We reserved a garden room with a small exterior patio. Room was very nice if a little smaller than we expected very clean with ambiance touches which we appreciated.    Breakfast was included again nice - traditional dishes as well as cereals cheeses pastries. You need to ask if you want specific hot items such as eggs the information isn't freely given. There was relaxed traditional music in the morning at breakfast and the evening at aperitifs.  The restaurant is very good for lunch and dinner. You can eat outside if the weather is warm enough.    Service can be patchy around the pool you're better off finding a waiter and ordering than waiting. Oh and watch out for the birds they sit in the branches of the trees over some of the sun loungers and fire on the unsuspecting :-)    Other than that:  - noise : little to no sound proofing you can hear way too much from inside your room  - spa : lovely lady doing the treatment but the treatment itself felt approximate - sploshing of water and slapping on of creams.  - rooms : there are roof top rooms with extra large patios with a view over the garden. Even more expensive than our room they didn't seem worth it. Otherwise there are the cheapest rooms with a seating area in the interior (riad) areas.Given the price difference it seemed better to splurge for a garden room with an outdoor seating area. These garden rooms extend all the way down to the end of the garden to the old library. I'd ask for a room towards the back as there's less noise,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Paris, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WatchysWayOut

The beds were extremely comfortable the staff were wonderful the facilities including a small gym outside pool and lounging area and a service of various relaxation methods (the 30 minute massage would be HIGHLY recommended!). Not to mention the free-roaming tortoises which I found extremely charming. The staff were very efficient and gave us information about the best places to visit and booked us taxis etc and they were especially when we arrived very late at night. A very cultural experience i found especially with the choice of perfume they sprayed on your pillow (ah the little things in life!).

It is a nice enough room but it is sadly has a big bay window situated right over the staff working area as well as the bins. The bay window is situated to the left of the bed and to the right of the bed is another window which is to the courtyard so if you have managed to fall asleep while the staff finish of cleaning the kitchen you will be sure to be woken up by late nighters and if you are a late night person and need to sleep in you will be woken up by the cleaners who congregate by the linen cupboard which also outside your room.

The excellent friendly and subtle service begins as soon as you walk in from the street. Glorious gardens complimentary mint tea and dates lovely scents panoramic views from the sun terrace lovely authentic meals and generally great and friendly service. Some lovely additions such as choosing the scent for your pillow and scattered rose petals.    A few things to note were slightly strange timings around when lunch is and isn't available - e.g. sandwiches from 3pm..? I had been worried from some reviews that the pool is very shady and there are indeed some tall trees surrounding. However it is perfectly easy to follow the sun around and the majority of the pool was in the sun with the upstairs sun terrace perfect for evening basking.    We also sampled the hammam - with the welcome ritual offered at the time of our booking. It was fabulous.    I highly recommend the Jardins and will definitely be staying again.

It is not a crisp Four Seasons but rather like home - just a bit ""shabby chic"" but comfortable and welcoming. If you are looking for a hotel where you can comfortably escape from the world this is it.  Our room was large and had a semi-private patio. it was stashed into a corner which sounds negative - not so. To get to it you walked through the delightful hotel garden (with turtles wandering about) by fruit-baring orange trees and by the attractive swimming pool.  We arrived after a long drive from Fes so decided to ""settle"" for dinner at the hotel - and dinner turned out to be the best meal yet on our trip. If you eat here be sure to order the Moroccan salads. The female chef adds a spin of her own on these salads that is simply delicious. (We especially enjoyed the tomatoes poached in cinnamon and a touch of sugar).  Each morning a small basket was hung on our door knob holding a newspaper.  There was a big basket in the room when we arrived with two beach towels and a sun hat to best enjoy the pool.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Analyticaltraveller wrote a review Mar 2016,50,Top Class,I can't recommend this Riad more highly. It is a very slick and professionally run hotel. We were met at the airport then a lovely welcome with hot towels and mint tea and choice of scents for our pillows! We had a garden side room which was one of the cheaper ones but still large a big comfy bed with a separate sitting area and terrace. Lots of nice touches such as turn down service with next days weather forecast a basket with straw hats and fans and scented candles and scented oil burner not to mention lots of rose petals! We ate in the hotel every evening there was a good choice of Morrocan and other dishes and reasonably priced local wines. We enjoyed the log fires and live Morrocan music. The dining room staff were excellent. Breakfast was very good and well served. Lunch was served on a lovely shady terrace. The pool area gardens and roof top terrace all immaculate. The pool was heated and large enough to swim lengths. The hotel was an old palace and built in the traditional style around a courtyard with lush gardens full of orange trees and birds. Very quiet and restful. It is situated within the Kasbah area of the Medina which is the southern end so it was a bit of a walk to the square but very interesting and we felt safe. It was our first visit to Marrakech and we absolutely loved everything. We took things slowly and visited most of the sights going out in the mornings and relaxing by the pool later. We were there at the end of Feb and weather was lovely and sunny but cool in evenings. So much to see and experience in the Medina. We would definitely return and stay at les Jardins de la Medina. Only negatives were slightly lumpy pillows and they had run out of maps. Not much information on the sights as apparently the tour companies like to push their own tours but we were independent travellers. Can't think why more people don't go as is only just over 3 hours flight good quality hotels easy airport transfer and lovely winter sun and culture to soak up as well what more can you ask for.

Les Jardins de la Medina,212rcm wrote a review Mar 2016,50,Stunning!,We came to stay here in November 2014 and we're ready to go and visit again. What an amazing hotel. It really is a hidden gem in the middle of Marrekesh. I only realised recently that i hadn't written a review for Les Jardins and yet I keep recommending it to friends. We were picked up by a hotel driver (who waited an hour and a half as our plane was delayed and thought nothing of it) and he dropped us at a lovely wooden door in the old city. The welcome was wonderful and we were given a tour of the beautiful grounds. The garden is lovely and the roof terrace is beautiful we spent about 3 days solidly up there drink tea and gin & tonics. The only time i wasn't up there was when i was having a lovely massage.    Pros  - We stayed in the lowest priced room and it was AMAZING. We had a garden terrace fresh flowers and a beautiful marble bath and the biggest bed I've ever seen. Next time we're going for a rood terrace :)  - The cooking course - BOOK THIS it's awesome!!!!  - The roof terrace  - The resturant  - The staff : they were all amazing every one of them.  - The introduction to the hotel  - The facilities: there's a pool and they have a dvd library at reception if you'd like it.    Cons  - None....it was wonderful!!    I would defintley recommed booking the cooking course it was the best thing we did so much fun and we got to sit and eat it by the pool. The walk to the Madina was a fun experience (the roads are quite epic and difficult to cross but good fun). We had some lovely mint tea in the square and a wander around the shops.    People will try and take advantage of you as you're walking through the streets (Just make sure that you're clear if you don't want to follow someone who wants to show you the next shop in the souk.) but that is not true at this hotel they don't push anything onto you and they don't ask for tips which is lovely - they just ask you to leave anything you'd like at the end to go amongst all the staff.

It is about 20 minutes' walk from the main square and as others have said in a quieter and less touristy part of town. The rooms are huge and the staff charming. Touches such as allowing you to choose the scent which housekeeping sprays on your bed linen are a nice idea. Breakfast was kind of an odd buffet affair very white carb/sugar centric and less enjoyable than traditional breakfasts served in other riads. Eating at the restaurant for dinner however was an altogether different experience and throughly recommended.    My only negative comment was a massage at the spa - which was pretty poor and certainly not of the standard found even in the local public hammam. However this aside if you are looking for something more than a regular riad but don't want to stay in a chain hotel then give this a try. You won't be disappointed.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Camden, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sb1London
Les Jardins de la Medina,Todd B wrote a review Jan 2016,30,Good base for exploring Marrakech,We spent four nights here in December and the property in indeed quite lovely. But we found our room even though it was quite spacious to be a bit past its prime. If it were an option I would rate our stay as good but Trip Advisor doesn't offer that.    Pros: lovely interior lush gardens highlighted by large pool; friendly staff; spacious room; large private terrace; friendly staff; good location inside the Medina but away from the bustle; generous breakfast buffet (the hostess remembered our preferences every morning and delivered them without being asked)  Cons: heater didn't work so we were given portable space heater; lumpy pillows; dark shower; very slow WiFi; fitness room is hard to access and only offers three older cardio machines,Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Los Angeles,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ToddB55

However the management were very helpful and booked the Riad next door for us (Villa Makassar - equally excellent) and offered us a free upgrade at their hotel for the second night. The rooms were clean and spacious and the breakfast was the best we had in Morocco. Needless to say staff were extremely friendly warm and welcoming.

Les Jardins de la Medina,DrCC P wrote a review Dec 2015,50,An oasis in the madness,Stayed here for a pre-Christmas break. The hotel is in a great location in the heart of the Medina. It is tucked away so you almost don't notice it but when you walk through the doors a sense of calm envelops you. We were upgraded to a room with a small sitting room and French doors out to a patio in front of orange trees and exotic blooms. The room had all the key things a safe kettle and coffee machine (all essential after a day in the souks). The bar is very comfortable and has a lovely fire in the evening. The pool is small but very relaxing and there is a lovely roof terrace to catch the afternoon sun (with views of the Atlas Mountains). The staff are very helpful and the hotel puts on a cocktail party on Fridays which is a good chance to catch up with other guests. The restaurant seemed a little expensive (but that is when compared with the very cheap street food).. Breakfast was a real experience .. They keep bringing food so pace yourself! I can't recommend this hotel enough.... Lovely.,Date of stay: December 2015,,"Bedford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thompsoncroft
Les Jardins de la Medina,Nic R wrote a review Nov 2015,50,Oasis in Busy Medina,We just got back from a 3 night stay here in Marrakech and couldn't have been happier at this hotel. The service from the second you walk in the door is top-notch. The rooms are all different; all three of ours were wonderful in their own way. The gardens on the property are impeccable and the pool looked lovely although we didn't have time to enjoy it unfortunately. The hotel is about a 15-minute walk from the main square in the old city in a fairly busy part of town called the Old Imperial Quarters. It's very busy but very safe. Lots of locals always around which we enjoyed. You step inside the hotel and the noise and craziness of Marrakech just disappears. The breakfast in the mornings is wonderful also with fantastic service. And you MUST dine in the retardant one evening. It is beautiful and the food is incredible. My only complaints would be the mattresses were a bit too firm my liking and the WiFi connection is a bit slow and inconsistent. But I enjoyed being cut-off from the outside world for a few days so I didn't mind that too much.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Truckee, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/100nicr
Les Jardins de la Medina,LoulouBlue75 wrote a review Nov 2015,50,An oasis in the Medina,This is our second stay at Les Jardins de la Medina. We rebooked as we enjoyed our first stay here so much. Les Jardins is an oasis away from the hustle and bustle of the souks and busy streets of Marrakech. As soon as you walk in you are welcomed by the very friendly staff and you relax. Upon arrival we were welcomed with some mint tea and dates while our passports were checked then we choose a scent for our room orange blossom.    The large heated swimming pool is set amongst the tropical gardens with banana and orange trees and create a calming atmosphere after a busy day trawling the souks.    The bedrooms are very tastefully decorated and spacious with little touches such as rose petals scattered in the bathroom. This time we had a shower which was one of the best in any hotel we have stayed at previously.    There is a lovely bar with an open fire where we enjoyed pre-dinner Mojitos and then had a delicious meal of lamb and veal tagines.    Breakfast is also a veritable feast with a selection of pastries breads fruits yoghurt cheese meats smoked salmon merguez sausages and freshly cooked omelette.    We will always return to Les Jardins if we return to Marrakech as we risk being disappointed if we stay anywhere else.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Edlesborough, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoulouBlue75

The rooms are lovely staff are very friendly food is great and the gardens are fantastic. I love this little paradise in the middle of Marrakech. Last time we came there were few guests that smoked. This time we cannot get away from them. Although smoking is not permitted in the rooms guests smoke round the pool on the terraces and even in the dining area! We have tried sitting on our own room terrace to have it wafting up from below. This haven has been spoilt by other guests.

Les Jardins de la Medina,KAN009 wrote a review Nov 2015,40,Relaxing and tranquil Riad,We booked Les Jardins for our honeymoon and overall had a wonderful stay. The hotel upgraded us on arrival to a lovely room with a private gated sun terrace. The room was beautifully decorated and very comfortable. The hotel grounds are well kept and beautiful. Terrace on the roof was lovely and had great views across the city and to the atlas mountains.    The hotel is in the Kasbah area of the city which felt very authentic less touristy and was a very interesting area to walk around. It is close to the Saadian tombs and the Mellah (Jewish) quarter.    Although this is a big riad we didn't really feel on top of the other guests although this could have been because our room was quite secluded.    The only negative was the breakfast which we felt could be improved in terms of presentation variety and quality of the coffee. However this would not stop us returning to the hotel.,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KAN009
Les Jardins de la Medina,LordCadwell wrote a review Oct 2015,50,A veritable oasis,"Les Jardins has large and well equipped rooms but retains it's original authenticity and combines this with lush planting in an immaculately maintained courtyard there are myriad little corners to lose yourself in whether tiny courts with fountains loungers beneath the towering palms the loggia or rooftop sofas. The pool is long enough and deep enough to swim in which is unusual in the medina but the most remarkable aspect of this riad are the staff. Upon entering the unassuming doorway you are immediately made relaxed and welcome - your bags discretely taken lead to the sunny courtyard and presented with cold towels and a selection of Moroccan refreshments. From the front desk who welcome you ""home"" with genuine warmth after your pursuits in the city through porters chamber maids and waiting staff who have permanent yet not sickly smiles all manage to combine efficiency with courtesy and warmth - a rare trick indeed.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Paulette H wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Unexpected extras in a great location,We were at the end of a month long trip through Spain Portugal and Morocco and had stayed in some pretty fabulous places but this one was by far the best. From the first moment we stepped into this oasis of calm and tranquility the staff was there with little details that made it special. We expected mint tea and a cold refreshing cloth on our arrival but not the milk and dates and certainly not the staff member asking us if which scent we would like spritzed on our pillow at night. (We chose verbena). Our towels were sprinkled with fresh rose petals and fresh pastries left in a mini-tagine in our room. If you chose to relax around the pool a small refreshing glass of fruit pur√©e would arrive sometime mid-afternoon. This is not the place for lively families as it clearly states that the pool area is quiet the better to hear the birds in the trees all around you. Some evenings there was a free cocktail function and live traditional music. It was so nice to meet some of our fellow travellers. The restaurant food was a mix of traditional Moroccan and International dishes. We mostly chose Moroccan dishes and were never disappointed. It was our first time in Marrakesh but won't be our last if only to come back here and be pampered.,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PauletteH637

The gardens are very nice giving a very tranquil feel to the place. Look out for all the tortoise wandering around!    Shopping tip: go around the souks to see what you like ( we found it impossible to find the shops recommended by the hotel) but buy from the govt run co-operative 5 minutes from the hotel near the Saadien tombs. The price is fixed at a reasonable level and apart from a small commission the profit all goes back to the female artisans. A good tip from the hotel receptionist.

Les Jardins de la Medina,ZaidD_13 wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Just Perfect,If you're looking for somewhere to stay in the Medina you'll notice that a lot of them are very highly rated and often described as 'an oasis in the Medina' or similar. For my wife and I this made it very difficult to pick a place - they couldn't ALL be good? As it turns out this is more a reflection on the madness of the Medina than the individual Riad - I think people were just happy to get out of the chaos and put their feet up! Which is no bad thing of course but it doesn't answer the question: how to pick a legitimately excellent place to stay? I'll make it easy for you: stay at Les Jardins de la Medina.    My wife and I wanted to be in the Medina but not in the center of it all. This hotel is in the Kasbah area. I've heard it described as being a bit shady but I can't think why. Walking the immediate streets there were few tourists and it was mostly local. Maybe that's why people didn't like it but for us it was welcome. It felt more authentic and not the tourist trap that many of the central areas were. People left us alone and went about their business even at night. One disadvantage was that taxis didn't really know where the hotel was but they all knew the main street connecting to it: Rue de Kasbah. From there it's a very short walk.    The hotel itself: wonderful. it's a giant Riad and very luxurious. Rooms were amazing the facilities were top notch and all the rest of it. Look through the other reviews and no doubt you'll read that a lot so I won't go into it.    But beyond all that the one aspect that made our stay so memorable was the friendliness tirelessness and helpfulness of the staff. They went out of their way to make our stay as comfortable as possible it was fantastic. From Youssef* at the front desk to Fatima in the restaurant and pool area to Yacine and the others they were just great. One evening we got back quite late and just wanted a small dinner of some bread and cheese. Here in the North East of the US I don't think any hotel would've accommodated such a simple (but off menu) request. They brought us cheese and bread to the room at no charge as well as some small pastries. When we were leaving we had some ceramics that needed to be wrapped and one of the staff (I don't remember your name sir I'm sorry) went out and got some bubble wrap and wrapped the item at no cost.    Overall I can't stress enough how lovely our stay here was. If you do end up staying here know that you're staying in a truly top class hotel. Please tip the staff and please treat them like the good human beings they are. A big thank you to the staff at Les Jardins de la Medina!    *To Youssef at the front desk: I watched John Wick on your recommendation and you were right it is a lot of fun.

It is in the Kasbah area of Marrakech about a 10 minute walk south of the Saadian tombs and 20 minutes from Jemma el Fna. The immediate area around the hotel is not particularly tourist-y compared to the areas around the Square but has some excellent local cafes nearby (Cafe Clock Cafe Kasbah). It is the perfect place to escape the often busy pace of the city and relax.    The hotel is beautifully decorated if a little aged in places (peeling paintwork outside for example). The gardens are lovely with lots of private areas where you can sit in the sun or the shade. The pool and surrounding area are nice and the hotel staff bring complimentary cold flannels and fresh fruit during the afternoon. There is a beautiful shared roof terrace as well. We did agree with one previous reviewer about the breakfast which wasn't quite five star but the Moroccan crepes and pancakes with honey were delicious and the staff do go out of their way to accommodate you. The turn down service with perfume and Moroccan pastries with tomorrow's weather forecast was excellent.    We also took advantage of the hotel spa having an amazing hammam and massage afternoon as well as a morning in the cookery school. We were taught the fundamentals of Moroccan cooking and then ate our creations for lunch which was a brilliant experience.    We stayed in a ""les solariums"" room which was on the first floor with a small shaded patio next to a staircase leading to a private roof terrace with a shower and two sunchairs under an umbrella - all very nice.

I chose the hotel for its gardens knowing it would be very hot. I wanted to come back at the end of the day to a little oasis and it didn't disappoint.  Prior to visiting the hotel I emailed them to advise them it was our wedding anniversary and as a result they upgraded us to a garden room which was a room on the first floor with a balcony overlooking the gardens. The room was a good size with a bottle of water and complimentary pastries. There were toiletries in the bathroom which were all sold in the hotel and smelt divine! The bed was turned down every evening and a new bottle of water in your room with a pastry. The pillows however were a little hard.  Although our flight arrived early in the morning they still arranged for us to get into our room earlier after enjoying a glass of hibiscus juice and some pastries sat by the fountain in the courtyard.  All the staff were so friendly in the hotel. The front of house manager and the general manager all took time to introduce themselves.  The pool area was surrounded by plants which also provided some welcome shade. The breakfast had a very good choice with a chef waiting to make you fresh pancakes. You could also have a more traditional breakfast which was delicious.  We dined in the hotel restaurant with our fiends one evening and the food was fantastic including the Moroccan wines. We had previously dined at a top restaurant in marrakesh but the food at this hotel was much better.  Considering it was Ramadan whilst we were staying in marrakesh the staff still did everything they could to ensure you enjoyed your stay. There was a limited service in the restaurant and bar for an hour about 7.15 and although we were sat in the bar area just enjoying the surroundings they still took the time to share their food and bring us a bowl of Moroccan soup.  The hotel was at the south end of the medina and you can walk everywhere from here although after a hot day in the souks we would get a taxi which was very cheap less than ¬£5. We would also walk beck to our medina at night and the streets were very busy and you always felt very safe.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Alison W wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Excellent service and accommodation,We were initially disappointed by the room we were given but on request we were upgraded to a room with a garden view and a private balcony. The staff were lovely polite and couldn't do enough for us even though it was Ramadan and very hot so it must have been very difficult for them serving the restaurant and bar while fasting. All told it was a fabulous relaxing break and we were sad to leave. We loved this hotel and it couldn't have been more tranquil. Highly recommended.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Peter R wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Beautiful Riad in the Medina,"We have just returned from a great holiday in Morocco where we stayed in three locations the first one being this stunning Riad within the old walled city. It is located about 15 mins walk from Jemma El Fna so an easy walk to the square and the souks and restaurants. Local Petite Taxis were easily available and quite reasonable for example it was only 50 Dirham to go to the Majorelle Gardens. Be sure to agree the price before going as we had one driver who tried to charge 100 to bring us back. He soon agreed to the 50 rate when my wife started to climb out of his car! We had a lovely large ground floor garden room with a small lounge attached which gave us easy access to the pool and restaurant area. The pool although small was a lovely area with good quality mattress sun beds and large towels.The bathroom was impeccable with all the toiletries you would expect in a top hotel. Each night the staff would come in to prepare your room and spray the pillows with a scent we had chosen on arrival. The food in the restaurant was top class and they had a good selection of local wines ( the Medaillion was as good as any good Bordeaux ). Staff were very attentive and would appear at the pool with little complimentary glasses of ""Amuse Bouche"" every now and then. The restaurant has a very interesting way of keeping clients cool they have a water spray system which cools but does not make you wet. We also stayed in Kazbah Angour ( would not recommend this hotel ) near the Atlas Mountains and the L'Heure Bleu in Essaouria which was fantastic. Please see see separate reports for each of these plus the Majorelle Gardens which are a definite ""must do "" if you visit Marrakech.",Date of stay: June 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Belfast, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeterR126
Les Jardins de la Medina,Stumpy74 wrote a review Jun 2015,40,The Calm away from the madness,This place is a total contrast from the madness that is the centre of Marrakech. It's so calm and peaceful. We've just returned after staying for 5 nights. The weather was very hot but there are shady areas in the gardens if you want to stay out of the sun.    You can walk to the main square or reception will call you a taxi. Make sure you agree the price before you get in.    We ate in the restaurant every night and all of the food was delicious. Breakfast in the morning was great with a wide choice. Lunch is also good the salad of the day is delicious.    Our room was lovely and spacious and very clean. The rose petals were a nice touch as was the bottle of water each day.

Les Jardins de la Medina,iandorothy wrote a review Jun 2015,50,What lies behind the wooden door?,As you drive down the narrow lane and stop at the wooden door entrance you wonder if you have come to the right place. The door opens and a smiling member of staff takes your luggage and you enter into the cool reception area and then after giving over you passports you are shown to a seat adjacent the outside dining area and given a glass of mint tea and a chilled towel. The reception member of staff then joins you and explains meal times etc and then asks you to select a perfume that will be sprayed in your room at night when the maid comes to turn down the bed. We were then led to the room by another member of staff who explained everything about how things worked. The room was large with a king size bed 2 chairs coffee table a log fire (definitely not needed at this time) a bottle of water (replaced daily) and a bowl of Morrocan sweets. There is a kettle and sachets of flouvered teas no coffee and a mini bar. The bathroom has a shower over the bath and good quality toiletries.  On the first night we ate in the restaurant and the staff and food were excellent. Breakfast is a buffet with something for everyone. There is a great selection of quality teas. Be aware as you are eating outside the bird life will drink your juice from your glass if you leave it unattended and the sparrows sit on the bread basket and nibble the end of the bread sticks so I would advise you to take of a few centimetres off the end of the bread before eating it. this of course could be avoided if paper lids were on the glasses and instead of napkins over the bread a large muslin cover would stop the birds. Birds are not the only wild life as the Riad tortoises wander around the area. Towels are laid out on the sunbeds around the pool and if more are needed they can be found just beyond the pool. There are other places to relax on the terraces on the 3rd floor roof where you also get great sun set views.  In the afternoons at the pool a member of staff brought around a small refreshment (smoothy or ice cream) a lovely welcome touch.  When the maid comes to turn down the bed not only does she do that and tidy the room but she leaves 2 sweets and a weather forecast for the following day. The gardens in the Riad are well maintained and among them are small areas where you can sit in seclusion. Adjacent the spa there is a small exercise area.  You can exchange currency at reception. On the Wednesday evening the management invited guests to the bar bar for drinks and nibbles and live music from a very happy musician. Staff from the spa were also in attendance giving neck and shoulder massages.  The Riad is only a 20 minute walk to Jemaa-El- Fna square. (Leaving the hotel turn left left againbe aware of the traffic it can be quite manic keep walking passing the Mosque on the right and the merc taxi station cross the road walking slightly to your left and then take the first right this leads you onto the square.After visiting this area it is great to return to the Riad for peace and Quiet.  A shower room is available if you have a late flight and are not able to extend your checkout time.  I have only 1 negative comment and that is I personally do not think that dogs should be allowed in the restaurant  We would most definitely return to this superb establishment,Date of stay: June 2015,,"Dundee, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iandorothy

Les Jardins de la Medina,Margita - Glee of Life wrote a review May 2015,50,Tropical Paradise,You would never know this beautiful hotel and THAT garden were behind the heavy wooden door in the Medina.    We received a very warm welcome of lovely Moroccan tea cakes and dates.    Our room was the garden suite which was excellent. Opulent luxurious with private outside terrace and loungers. There was a fruit basket fresh flowers refreshments (even Nespresso maker!) cakes and a basket with pool towels straw hats and maps which was a lovely touch.    Lunch was absolutely delicious best food I have had in Marrakech during our 4 day stay!    Absolutely picture postcard garden. Tropical. Exciting. Staying here is like living in a bird sanctuary surrounded by palms banana and orange trees birds chirping away and tortoises strolling through the grounds!    We had a delicious goat cheese salad for starters chicken tagine with olives (yum) and selection of mixed platter for main. The dessert was a selection of fresh mint vanilla and chocolate ice cream and pineapple raspberry and mango sorbet. Without a fail the best desert I have ever tasted. I still dream about it; yep it was that good! The food was really outstanding many congratulations to the chef.    Breakfast was an excellent selection of continental and traditional delights. Coffee tea fresh juices were on tap and fresh pastries were simply delicious. Cheeky sparrows were trying to steal food off the breakfast tables!    There are few roof terraces with chairs and loungers where you can kick back and relax.    On day of our departure the hotel manager Luc held Saturday night drinks with free wine and snacks complete with traditional music which I enjoyed very much. It was a great opportunity to meet other guests too.    Very helpful and attentive staff immaculate rooms outstanding food great ambience and the most beautiful tropical garden you could hope for having on your doorstep! I sincerely recommend this 5 star hotel.    A big thank you to all the lovely staff who looked after us you made our last day in Marrakech truly unforgettable.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Linda F wrote a review May 2015,40,A very comfortable place to stay,The gardens which surround the pool are beautiful and well-kept. The restaurant is attractive. The dinner we had there fell short of what we had thought it would be after seeing the grounds and our rooms but the buffet breakfasts were more than satisfactory.  The rooms are sophisticated and well-furnished. Our room had an extra sitting room -- we had two! -- but our friends' room right above us did not have one. Our reservations were for rooms overlooking the gardens. Instead our windows looked over an alleyway and into a residential neighborhood. Outside of our room was a patio with two small tables and several chairs which looked over the gardens. Our friends came down a flight of stairs to use the patio. We had been told it was our patio but another guest seemed to think it was the perfect place to smoke. Fortunately she arrived just a day before we were to leave.  All the rooms on the second and third floors were reached from stairways. The layouts were interesting but there was no elevator at least on our side of the medina. The sun deck on our side of the building was on the fourth floor. The sun deck which we visited late in the afternoon had not been cleared of used plates.  There was a problem with the prepayment of our reservation. We had sent in a credit card number seven months before our arrival but when we checked out we were told we hadn't paid. I could not remember if I had seen the charge on my credit card bill. We were told we should call when we got home if indeed the charge had gone through. The manager said the card had been rejected. Turns out the card had to be cancelled due to an unauthorized charge by a stranger a week before we were to leave on our trip. That was seven months after having made the reservation. The same thing happened to us in a hotel in Rabat our first stop!  We will now think of Morocco as the place that doesn't collect their payment until the last minute.  I cut my hand while putting a new roll of toilet paper on its holder. There was a screw sticking out that was invisible to the eye. The staff was responsive in that they sent someone to look at it but they did not cover the sharp end of the screw or replace it.  There is a small boutique near the dining room that has some nice little gifts.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Detroit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NonniefromMichigan

It has an advantage over many riads of being accessible by vehicles so the taxi can pick up and drop off at the door.  Our ground floor room was spacious with a separate seating area and large comfortable bed. The bathroom was small but functional and beautifully decorated in the local style. Nice little little touches of bowl of local sweets in the room. The large bottle of complimentary water was also replenished each day.  We booked half board as there are not many restaurants nearby. The food was very good but after four nights the menu had not changed and the choices were becoming limiting. There was a good choice of western and local food for breakfast.  The pool area had plenty of shade to hide from the sun whilst the rooftop terrace would be great for sun lovers.  The staff were helpful and the hotel arranged a driver to take us to the Atlas Mountains. Although he didn't speak english and our french was very limited he was a great guide and the trip was the highlight of the holiday.

Les Jardins de la Medina,topdoc55 wrote a review Apr 2015,50,Desert delight!,This was our third visit to Marrakech but the first to this hotel which is relatively small (36 rooms I think). It is a lovely place to stay. Like so many Marrakech hotels it is found down an unassuming alley the front door opens into a haven of peace and relaxation. It is within walking distance of most sights (the main square being 20-30mins depending how distracted you are by the sights sounds and smells). We had a 'solarium' room which includes its own private sun terrace. In our view this would be essential if you want some sunbathing . It seemed to us that some rooms on the ground floor would never get any sun.The pool is small but very nice pick your sunbed carefully if you want sun/shade. Be careful not to stand on the tortoises which amble about the grounds!  The breakfast buffet was nice if not exceptional. The dinner menu was also good we ate there twice out of our six days which is about right if you don't want it to become repetitive. The spa was limited but the hammam was a nice change.  Reception were helpful in arranging a driver for us to go to the coast for a day (2 1/2hrs drive) recommended if you are in Marrakech for more than a few days.  We would most definitely stay in this hotel again if/when we return to Marrakech. However I would agree with another very recent post in that service at breakfast lunch and dinner can be a bit muddled and inconsistent. Menus not given drink orders not taken coffee not replenished at breakfast cutlery not replaced long gaps between courses etc etc. Little things but annoying and easy to change with some good direction from a restaurant manager.

Through a door at the far end of the Kasbah area of the old walled city of Marrakech sits an Oasis of superb ambiance and quiet with excellent facilities that are not that of a run of a mill hotel no matter how good but 'more personal' which was truly a new experience for us.    Given the weather was not too kind there was a limitation of sitting area's with access to the bar. However that was a small issue given weather impact.    Good all round facilities with alternatives to sitting by the pool with sun decks out of the way available.    Only minor critical view was service in the restaurant. Good but not up to the high standards of the rest of the experience with staff needing to concentrate on what are not a significant number of guests. Found at breakfast specifically needing to chase for refills as an example.    In saying that a wonderful place to stay and a first and very enjoyable experience in Marrakech. A point to consider the Riad is out of the way and you do need to walk a way to get to the centre or use taxi's however that is also why we chose Jardins de la Medina as it sits outside the considerable bussle of the vibrent old city centre.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hereford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/847gregf
Les Jardins de la Medina,keithmalin wrote a review Mar 2015,50,"Outstanding hotel, calm, lush, great service, all at a price",There is little to say against the Jardins de la Medina a luscious haven of green and calm offering lovely rooms a great restaurant and a wonderful part of the Marrakech experience. It does not come cheap but if your budget does not stretch to the Mammounia (we preferred the Jardins anyway) and you want to stay in rather than outside of the city then this is a highy recommended venue.    As with many Marrakech hotels it is a little hard to find and hides its precious jewels behind a sturdy gate. All staff were unfailingly helpful and some exceptional in their sensitivity of what westerners want (ie being on hand but not too pushy - plenty of that elsewhere in the city!). The reception were able to sort out any issue and problem and always with a smile.    There is a lovely pool (not large but beautifully set) in the gardens which themselves are heavy with the scent of fruit trees and full of chirping birdlife. Most rooms are 'patio' rooms meaning direct access into the gardens. These however are not so private because of the garden walkways so if you can pay extra for a 'garden' room perversely on the upper floor but with its own private balcony.    Rooms are a delight and beautifully fitted out. Wireless internet works reasonably well there is air-con and a ceiling fan tea-making facilities and a flat screen TV (with BBC World). Rooms are cleaned meticulously and with care.    The breakfast is a vast spread of international and Moroccan delights with fresh fruit juice to begin with and the possibility of ordering eggs and a huge variety of teas as well. The hotel has its resident musician who can be heard strumming away from time to time.    The restaurant also serves a delicious dinner though prices are towards the top end of the market with wines especially pricy. Main courses 180 dirhams (18 euro) for Moroccan and 250 dirhams (25 euro) for international. Wines start (local) at 300 dirhams (30 euro).    We had a hire car from the airport booked much more cheaply in advance from the UK. This is not for the faint hearted - you have to drive inside the walls - but the hotel once you have found it will put the car in its garage for free which is useful. The hotel supplied a useless map of how to drive to the hotel itself. Luckily we had the sense to ignore it.    The only downside of the hotel is its location at the southern end of the old city. This means very easy access from the airport and to destinations outside Marrakech but it is a good 20 minutes' walk to the main square and there is only one way to get there so this can be a bit tedious especially if you decide to take dinner outside the hotel - there are not that many options. But the magnificent Saadian Tombs are only 10 minutes away and the southern palaces 10-15. We would have liked to be 5 minutes closer to the action but you can't have everything.    Nearby eating places - Le Makassar (next door but pricy) Les Borjs de la Kasbah (less than 5 minutes excellent) and Cafe Clock for lighter fare (5 minutes).    To be highly recommended but have your walking shoes handy! To note that 4 days in Marrakech itself is ample to see all of the main sights. You may fancy a day or two in the Atlas Mountains and/or in Essaouira to get away from the hassle.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Guildford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keithmalin

It was. We had a lovely time - relaxing as soon as we got there with great surroundings and perfect service - nothing was a problem. It is an oasis with 5 star service.  The staff were great friendly and so happy to help - although it is difficult to mention everyone - special thanks to Rabbi Amina and our lovely Mr 21 with the haircut !!!

Les Jardins de la Medina,liliane d wrote a review Mar 2015,50,A lovely place,"We spent a week in this lovely ryad. Ideal place to relax in the mad atmosphere of the kasbah.  The staff was efficient and polite. We would have appreciated a few suggestions on where to go outside of Marrakesh from the reception but it did not matter. The cuisine was one of the best in town and a bit cheaper than other top ryad that we tried as well.    We were staying in a room ""cote jardin"" ground floor on the gardens. It was more of a suite than a room large and well equiped. We enjoyed having our tea in the afternoon on our little patio.    The hotel is about half an hour walk from the centre the narrow road leading to the main square was quite difficult to navigate because of mopeds and cars. So we ended up taking lots of taxis (very cheap).

Plenty of other correspondents have written about it so here are some additional thoughts. The Hamman bath is very expensive fine if you just want to stay in the hotel but five minutes walk away is an excellent place at half the cost. We also bought a trip to the Atlas Mountains just up the Kasbah ( same street as hotel)  it was excellent and less than half the price something similar was sold by the hotel. Just up the road is a fixed price Emporium that sells all the tourist stuff. Check out the prices there we ore you head off into the souk to start bargaining..    Word of warning - one of the tricks of the unofficial guides that latch on to you is to say "" remember me from working at the hotel"" . They don't. Strangely the first day in Morroco we had a so called guide who took us to some decent places and only wanted price of a packet of cigarettes. He is the one that saved us from spending a fortune in the hotel Hamman bath.

It is a lovely hotel and a good location within walking distance of the centre of Marrakech. Just make sure you don't get room 123. It looks beautiful but is situated above what is probably the heating /filtering system for the swimming pool. It goes on and off 24 hours a day like a plane taking off every few minutes and is later joined by what sounds like high pitched dental equipment.

The location is excellent as it is not noisy yet you can walk to many tourist attractions. The hotel has a lovely garden week kept and with interesting plants. The rooms are well appointed with a Moroccon style but a contemporary touch as well. The rooms were clean and spacious and all of them a bit different and very stylish. The breakfast has a nice selection of food and is served in a lovely veranda overlooking the gardens. The only reasons I am not giving it 5 stars are that the 'gym' is just 3 -4 machines in a tent in the garden and the wi-fi didn't work well.

Even if you haven't been to Marrakech (as we hadn't) you'll know that it's noisy and busy so you'll need somewhere relaxing to stay while you're there and you will not go wrong with Les Jardins de la Medina.  The staff are gracious and their service is friendly and discreet. We spent some whole days without leaving the hotel although both of us are normally quite active when we go away. This time we didn't want to leave our gorgeous surroundings.  Special mention must go to the fantastic buffet breakfast which includes the usual European hotel items (fruit cereal yougurt pastries etc.) but the hot dishes and Morrocan pancakes are out of this world!  We ordered room service breakfasts twice and turned breakfast into brunch. There's no rush and nobody comes back after twenty minutes to clear it all away again. We ordered dinner from the restaurant and had it delivered to the room on one occasion and would recommend doing this as we were able to sit outside and enjoy the night scents of the garden.

Then we were shown to our room a superior double which was on the ground floor. We had a huge bed separate lounge area small patio and a gorgeous bathroom - strewn with rose petals. We thought the rose petals were just for our arrival but they weren't - new ones arrived everyday when our room was cleaned!    We ate out in Marrakech a lot but we did also dine at the hotel a few nights and the food was exceptional. From the traditional lamb Tajine to a red Thai stirfry the food was delicious and a good selection of local and french wines too.    As we were staying for 10 nights we had plenty of time to explore Marrakech but also to simply relax at the hotel and we spent a few days lying by the pool. The bar staff were always happy to bring across a cocktail or two in the afternoon! They would also bring round cold face towels or a mini fruit smoothie - little touches that make you feel like you really are enjoying a luxurious break!    We loved it and I would definitely recommend this hotel!,Date of stay: September 2014,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexHeffer

Les Jardins de la Medina,Scrapmate wrote a review Sep 2014,50,A Wonderful Stay,This is a wonderful peaceful haven which you enter off a busy street. The riad has been beautifully refurbished to provide maximum comfort for the guests. The service was excellent with all staff members doing their utmost to ensure we had a pleasant stay. We had a garden room with our own table and chairs but there are various chairs (and even a hammock) to relax in dotted around the lush gardens. The gardens are beautifully maintained with orange banana date and other trees and flowers providing glorious shade from the searing heat. The place is luxurious but not stuffy so you relax as soon as you arrive and are given a welcome hibiscus drink and some dried fruit.  The restaurant provides good quality food but if there was a slight criticism I would make it would be that breakfast became a bit monotonous.  Location wise it is at the southern end of the Medina but the walk to the centre (La Place) is very interesting and not too long.  All in all the riad is an ideal place to stay within easy reach of many local attractions and some good restaurants.,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scrapmate

Les Jardins de la Medina,mike_uk82 wrote a review Sep 2014,30,Good hotel but not worth cost as it's in need of renovation,We enjoyed our stay at this hotel and the very friendly polite and professional staff were all perfect. The Solarium room was big clean and well equipt and the sun terrace was great for a nice private space to lie out in. The pool area and pool are nice to relax and lovely gardens run through the hotel. Breakfast was mostly very good- the service and selection great and freshly cooked items nice but most of the bread products were stale each day.  The negatives relative to other accomodation it's quite expensive and for this you would expect a lot which it largely delivered but things like beer or Coke being UK prices when litteraly next door they are a tenth of the price is a little annoying - your not staying in a London hotel.  My biggest complaint is that the whole palce needs renovating or at least a lick of paint I simply couldn't recommend a hotel that costs this much when door frames walls terrace walls woodwork all has peeling flakey paint it's simply not worth the money.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Jeremy C wrote a review Sep 2014,50,Wonderful base for Marrakech visit,A very luxurious four night stay. Our solarium room was well laid out had every amenity we could have wished for; and the upstairs private roof terrace was excellent for lying out late at night under a warm sky. The hotel is at the far south of the Medina so it's quite a walk to the very centre but it was a walk I always enjoyed through the busy and colourful shopping street. It highlighted the contrast between the hustle and bustle outside and the serenity of the riad itself with its very welcoming pool to relax beside in the heat of the afternoon. The staff were very welcoming and they encouraged us to stay on by the pool and provided us with a small dressing room with shower after we had checked out on the day of our departure.

Les Jardins de la Medina,IntrepidTravellersOZ wrote a review Aug 2014,40,"A beautiful hotel with a disabled access room, service at reception needs improvement",When looking for a hotel in Marrakech with a wheelchair accessible room we were faced with limited options. When I found Les Jardins de la Medina I was thrilled.  We opted for an airport transfer and even though I requested a car a van was sent to collect us. As I am in a wheelchair it was very difficult for me to get into the van but with the help of a very nice driver and my husband we managed.  On arrival to the hotel the reception area seemed quite disorganised and sent us to the bar where we were served a very pleasant welcome drink and some dried fruit/nut snacks. We did not get access to our room till 3:30pm and only after enquiring with the reception area (who seemed quite put out by the enquiry). The wheelchair access room is well set out but needs a bar on the wall near the toilet in addition to the pull down bar. The shower has a low tiled seat (as per photo) which had limited use for me.  After settling in we went back to reception to see if they could help us organise a day trip. Given my need for a wheelchair we were hoping they might help suggest an appropriate tour. To our disappointment the gentleman at reception had no interest nor provided any help.  There was a smell coming from the drain in our room but on reporting this to reception they did rectify this quickly.  I booked a facial in the spa and I cannot speak more highly of both the treatment and the lovely beautician who was more than happy to help in any way she could.  We ate in the restaurant on 2 occassions and on both occassions it was fantastic - in fact in both occassions I had the chicken and pear tagine because it was so good!! The desserts were also fabulous.  We did request a late check out from reception as there is no disabled toilet at the hotel outside of the room but were told this was not possible. Check out was 12pm we were hoping to keep the room till 2pm as we were leaving for the airport at that time. Check in was 3pm so we were hoping they would try to help us out - but they didn't. Even the manager would not budge and when we suggest we had been delayed in check in by 30 minutes she said she would check the footage they had. It was not a pleasant experience and given the cost and rating of this hotel confirmed that the administrative side of the hotel needed improvement.  The hotel was responsive to the need for a car to transfer us back to the airport.,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Brisbane, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IntrepidTravellersOZ

There were a number of extra perks including a small drinks party by the pool one evening. The breakfast was absolutely fantastic and we made the most of all the different options.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Ben L wrote a review Jul 2014,50,"Gracious, Sophisticated Sanctuary",This riad was at one end of the Medina within walking distance to several places of interest; and a cab ride to the center of town and the souks. We had a very spacious room on the ground level with two french doors opening out to the lush gardens and a separate sitting room where we had our breakfast. There is a central walkway outside which can get a bit busy and noisy at times - so you might want to request a room on an upper level if you want absolute quiet. The workout area is outdoors but the equipment is a bit tired. The staff (especially Youssef) was warm and friendly; they even had staff serve complimentary refreshments poolside at times and someone to clean your sunglasses! We had most of our meals here - great selection and service -- the indoor/outdoor dining areas had a romantic ambience. Make sure you try their tagines and coconut shrimp. Overall - a lovely sanctuary to come back to after your daily adventures in magical Marrakech.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Alan M wrote a review Jul 2014,50,Great Hotel,This is a great hotel with lovely gardens in the middle of the medina. The gardens and pool are great rooms lovely and the food from the restaurant top notch.  Most things have been said by others so here are my tips:  Airport  we flew British Airways on the afternoon flight that arrived with 6 other flights causing absolute chaos in a small airport that is only designed for one at a time. The result was over 1000 people queuing in the heat for over 2 hours to get through. If you arrive at this time make sure that you have plenty of water. better still catch the morning flight easy jet too and there is very little activity and you wont experience this.  Heat  Beware the heat is intense at this time of the year. 2 years ago we came at this time but went up into the mountains where there was a breeze inside the Medina there is no air and temperatures well into the 40's it can be totally exhausting.  The Medina  If you are visiting in the heat do visit one of the many restaurants surrounding the main sqauer for a drink and to see the sunset. Drinks are not expensive and there was always a breeze and plenty to see. Shopping is great and whilst you do get hassled if you say no politely you are left alone. My advice is to say that you are staying for several more days and will come back to their shop.  The hotel  Great place staff are all polite and helpfull food in the restaurant is great and I would recommend a Solarium room providing you with a private terrace above your room for sunbathing and having an evening drink looking at the stars and a bit of a breeze!! The pool is lovely however if you want the sun you need to realise that most of the sunbeds are in shade and around the pool can get crowded becasue people are let in on a day pass to have luch and use the pool facilities- hence recommend the solarium room. Hammam and Spa treatments were good value and on the whole very good. My partner was a bit taken aback when a bucket of water was suddenly thrown over her without warning in the Hammam and another guest told us that this happened to her too. The massage that I had was excellent in itself the room was nice and it was cool just dont expect the same sort of sophistication that you get in the Far East or Dubai - no drinks afterwards etc. As I have already mentioned the food in the restaurant is excellent and the terrace area where the tables are set up has a great ambience. Our only criticism was other guests smoking whilst you are eating this was a real problem as some of the tables are very close together and on one night we were absolutely surrounded by French and Germans smoking throughout dinner all the more oppresive in the searing heat. When we checked out and mentioned it on our questionnaire we were told that the management are looking to ban smoking in both the rooms and the restaurant.  To summarise we had a great four nights here and you wont go far wrong staying here. make sure that you visit at a time where you can stand the heat and be prepared to allow time for your drinks and order to arrive it will be a bit slow but will happen!!!

Lovely room with balcony.    From the moment we arrived staff were very helpful. We were met with a dish of dried fruits and a drink and then shown around. Beforehand I had let the hotel know that my daughter was allergic to gluten and with our very first lunch they brought out freshly baked corn bread. From that moment we knew thay had paid attention to detail. The restaurant is one of the most beautriful in Marrakech among the olive and orange trees and at the side of the pool (lit gently at night). We really enjoyed our lunches here but felt the dinner menu could have been 'refreshed' - a shame as we would have eaten here more often.  The hotel is near the palaces and the tomb but about 15 minutes walk from the centre. Be careful not to ask the way as you often get sent the wrong way so that you have to 'pay' to find your way back!    The first 3 days were very peaceful and the pool was a great place to relax after hot and dusty Marrakech. On the last day a family with 3 young children checked in - they were noisy and splashing around a lot so I was pleasantly surpriosed that one of the rewstauant staff asked them to be quiet. To be honest a family with young children would be better to book elsewhere where there is a separate pool or more to do for children. This hotel was more suited to couples - or in our case a mother and daughter experiencing a new country and some shopping.

It was within 15 minutes walking distance of the centre of Marrakech to the Jeema el Fna market place yet was an absolute oasis of calm away from the madness and hassle of the city. The gardens are beautifully maintained around a lovely swimming pool. It was really relaxing and much needed after a day in the souks!  The breakfast offered an extensive choice of local and international foods. Husband enjoyed omelettes made to order and daughter loved the little speciality pancakes. After busy days out we also enjoyed an evening meal on the terrace beside the garden and pool. The staff are attentive and friendly but not intrusive.  Our standard room was very spacious and offered two rooms for the three of us.The settee in the lounge area became a standard sized bed for our daughter. It was all impeccably clean comfortable and beautifully presented. We had a lovely balcony terrace overlooking the gardens with chairs and a hammock.  Would strongly recommend this for your stay in Marrakech.  Nb. Eating in the night market is a fun experience and a good introduction to Marrakech if you arrive late afternoon/evening. The orange juice is fantastic - make sure you have it in a plastic cup rather than a glass one for hygiene purposes.  We also enjoyed a day in the Atlas mountains/visiting a traditional Berber village/camel ride/waterfalls organised by the hotel.

We love food and we have chosen the hotel also for the restaurant and we were not disappointed: it is delicious! The hotel is reasonnably baby friendly the rooms are beautiful the spa is good and very convenient if you want a treat while your partner has a little nap...we did not try the pool as we were there during winter but the hotel was still worth it not to mention the very friendly staff.

Les Jardins de la Medina,ShoeTravel wrote a review Jun 2014,50,A Relaxing Option in the Busy Medina,We really enjoyed our corner room on the top floor of this beautiful property with its sumptuous breakfast. I couldn't agree more with all the comments about its charm but I want to point out for my fellow US travelers that the cigarette smoke in common areas is a surprise. No it's not surprising that international travelers smoke but it is surprising to be so aware of the smell given the non-smoking requirements for public properties in the US. So on our return to this property from a 2-day jaunt in the mountains we then had a room outside one of the courtyards that unfortunately had a strong smell of smoke. Having gotten that comment out of the way the service is fantastic at this hotel and we really enjoyed the pool and gardens after working our way through the Medina and its craziness. Surprisingly it also was very quiet and relaxing a real contrast to the street outside. There are a number of lovely service touches such as the cold juice drink and towel at arrival the sweets in the room rose petals in the bath. Excellent ideas!,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Evanston, Illinois",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShoeTravel

Les Jardins de la Medina,Canadian G wrote a review Jun 2014,40,Kid friendly and very good food,This hotel is great for kids and family in fact it was the first hotel we had stayed at in our two week adventure with other families. The general manager actually mentioned he was going to bring his small dog in so that our daughter could play with him (and we really wish we had taken him up on that). Our room (a suite) was great and I believe it was the only one with it's own little private patio area with lounge chairs. After a week and a half of Morocco food we were so happy with the international foods offered here (not that Moroccan food isn't excellent). The Thai dishes we had were the best we have ever had which is saying a lot considering the multicultural food in Toronto. The hotel is located in the heart of the city and the service was excellent.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CanadianG_11

This is without doubt one of the best riads in its range price. We visited other riads (such as the one next door which was great for a meal) and the Maison L'Arabie which is real luxury but still have no complaints re our choice of Le Jardin de la Medina as the staff were very nice friendly and helpful. We had no issues with the room which is old fashioned French style and had everything one would want in a hotel room. Don't expect modern luxury but everything works and its really comfortable and pleasant. Breakfast was more than adequate and dinner was very good albeit from a limited menu and a wee bit pricey.

Les Jardins de la Medina,bunnco wrote a review Jun 2014,40,"Great Hotel, Lovely Gardens, Good Staff in the Royal Quarter",We stayed as a group for 4 days/3 nights and booked through Naturally Morocco in the UK. I'd stayed in Marrakech before and would normally have booked a small Riad but as a group we needed somewhere larger. The Jardins certainly fitted the bill. It was large enough to accommodate us but situated within the city walls so on-hand for all the sights.    Situated about 15 minutes walk south of the Main Square we were a little off the beaten track but right in the heart of the Royal Quarter and within sight of the Kings Palace.    What we didn't realise when we booked was that the hotel [seemingly] has the largest Riad Garden in the city [check-out Google Maps] as well as a proper swimming pool and lots of secluded nooks for lazing around. You wouldn't guess this from the street. You can certainly get privacy as well as mingle with other guests if you want. A true quiet Oasis in a busy/dusty city.    We ate one night in the hotel and the food was very good. Delicately flavoured local dishes and international for those who wanted that. We drank Moroccan wines with the meal which were errrrrr mixed. Tip: The higher priced ones were definitely an improvement on the cheaper ones. Service was always impeccable.    We benefited from the personal attention of the French owner/manager but it wasn't really necessary because the local staff were up to scratch from early starts and late-night drinks in the bar.    Recommended for a very comfortable stay if you want to be close-ish to the action [15 mins walk] as well as require lovely garden space for a bit of privacy/lazing around and pampering in addition to all the frenetic Souk/touristy stuff.,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Brooke, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bunnco

As it was part of a tour we don't know the room cost.  It is convenient to the medina and central Marrakech.

Les Jardins de la Medina,claire j wrote a review Apr 2014,50,Hidden luxury,I stayed with my husband and three children (aged 1310 and 5) for 3 nights at Jardins de la Medina. It really is a gorgeous place to relax and un wind from life and the hectic and fairly stressful streets of Marrakech. Unfortunately our family of 5 were split into 2 rooms (often happens with families of 5). Both rooms were spacious and luxurious. The children loved the gardens roof terrace finding the tortoises and swinging it the hammocks. The pool was a good size and a great temperature.  The reception staff were very warm and welcoming and were happy to arrange anything we wanted. The restaurant staff were friendly but often disorganised and slow. The menu could have had more choices for children or offered larger meals at half size/price (i did ask and they refused ) so eating in the Hotel was costly! Therefore we ventured out and had a some super meals elsewhere.,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Madrid, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clairej805
Les Jardins de la Medina,Laura wrote a review Apr 2014,50,Best ever,I have just returned from a 5 day break at Les Jardins with my 2 teens. This may not sound like the start of a complimentary review but thanks largely to this wonderful establishment we had a very enjoyable stay. We had a room for 3 one of the main reasons I chose this hotel as this is not an easy thing to find and it was absolutely stunning. The room was gorgeous the private patio was a delight as were the tortises that occasionally wandered through the bathroom was positively sumptuous. I may run out of complimentary adjectives before I get to the roof terrace the pool and the restaurant. It is all so beautifully done.    And the food.... we had breakfast and lunch there every day eating outside at the gorgeous poolside terrace. Dinner only on the first night and the couscous was great. Lunch was very very good with a menu that offered something for everyone and made it possible to eat there 5 days in a row without getting bored. The tagines were tender flavoursome and spiced to perfection sometimes traditional and sometimes inventive. And I had the best salade nicoise I have ever eaten and I have eaten a fair few in some nice places. The chef is very talented.    This was my second stay in Marrakesh and I much preferred this hotel and this location to the Palmeraie which was where I went last time. Inside the walls of the hotel the gardens are lush and it is peaceful so no need to be miles outside the city. The central position meant we could just walk out the door and we were right in the middle of it all including some good shopping a few nice little cafes and the Tombes Saadiens all within 1-15 minutes walking. And sometimes it was enough just to peer into the street from the roof terrace and watch everyone go by. They also offer to organise day trips to interesting places nearby but we did not take up this option. Next time.    The object of this holiday was to escape London for some sunshine provide a distraction free environment for exam revision see a different part of the world and spend some time in each others' company which doesn't happen when life gets busy at home. I think I might not have been the only one doing this as there were a few family groups there with both young and older children but there were also adult travellers so it never felt like a school holiday camp.    The staff are superb from the Director who is present and attentive down to the young men and women at reception. The hammam is also wonderful. Everyone was pleasant and helpful. This was a real treat because we do not often stay in such luxurious places. There was the risk I would be disappointed. But I am pleased to say it was genuinely one of the nicest holidays I have ever had and I cannot thank everyone at Les Jardins de la Medina enough for making our stay so fantastic.,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsLauraWH

Les Jardins de la Medina,finedinerStAlbans wrote a review Apr 2014,20,Very disappointing,After reading all the reviews on here we booked a table for our first evening meal as we were staying in a riad around the corner.  The hotel is very beautiful and the surroundings are lovely. The food was ok (more of that later)but unfortunately our evening was ruined by bad service. We all ordered our main courses at the table and our order was taken by a lady manager. I actually pointed out the dish I wanted (thai seafood curry)on the menu as I wanted to know if it came with rice and which seafood was in it. When our main dishes arrived I somehow ended up with veal curry with fried bananas!! I obviously pointed out the mistake she was very apologetic and at this stage I was fine and said if she gave me another glass of wine I would forget all about it. 25 mins later I still had an empty glass the rest of my party had finished eating and I was finally bought..........a rack of lamb!!!!! At this point I understandably got quite annoyed actually got hold of another menu and pointed out again what I wanted and that I still had no wine. 25 mins later I finally got the dish I asked for still no wine but after the 3rd time of asking was bought some. Needless to say by this point the evening was completely ruined I ate the dish but didn't enjoy it as I was so annoyed. To add insult to injury we then asked for the bill - they had not taken anything off to compensate so my husband informed them he would not be paying for my food or drink to which they agreed. Needless to say we didn't leave a tip. Interestingly they gave me a feedback form which I completed in detail leaving my number and email address thinking that maybe someone would get back to me to apologise as we were in Marrakech for another 5 days but no. My husband ordered the house special - the Royal Tagine - very disappointing he didn't even finish half.  So in conclusion - I realise based on the reviews here we were probably very unlucky with our experience however I think they are a Morrocan restaurant with Morrocan staff trying to emulate a European restaurant and they are just not up to it - as proved by the incident itself and the lack of follow up. All the subsequent meals out we had at our Riad and in local Morrocan restaurants were fantastic with excellent food because they were doing what they do best and not trying to be something they're not!!!!!! Please look at all my other reviews for restaurants in Marrakesh as they are all excellent!!!

Les Jardins de la Medina,PJB071962 wrote a review Mar 2014,50,The perfect Oasis,When you are specific in what you want from a hotel it always pays to do the research and take advice from those who have stayed before. I did so before booking Les Jardins and agree with many of the comments about the contrast when stepping from the narrow cobbled street through the front door and into the reception area. Closing the door takes away the noise and moves on to gentle relaxation with a sense of calm when you move past the bar / restaurant and on through into the garden. There is a huge amount of thought and a lot of effort gone into looking after the guests the bedroom we had was spacious and very comfortable the garden and pool are fantastic and the hotel staff are excellent making the atmosphere very relaxing which is just what you need after a day out in the city. We ate in the hotel all but one evening the restaurant and bar have a great ambiance and are very comfortable and the food excellently prepared presented and served.

Les Jardins de la Medina,nigelabbey wrote a review Feb 2014,50,A hidden jewel in the Medina,We spent five nights at Les Jardin de la Medina and found this to be a real jewel within the Medina. The unimposing street entrance belies the magnificent hotel within. Inside is a tranquil haven away from the frenzied of Medina. The central courtyard with a beautiful pool is a stunning tropical garden punctuated with interesting nooks and crannies artifacts and places to sit and relax. We arrived at night when it was illuminated. The low rise rooms surrounding the inner garden are laced with warren of intriguing patios water features and ornate staircases. Everywhere you walk you come across an unexpected view of the gardens.    The room we had was a Superior Room which was lovely. It had a Moroccan theme with contemporary overtones. All the windows had lovely inner shutters to keep out the light and heat. The bathroom was small but adequate. Every day and night the towels are changed and the bed prepared. However we did find the sprinkled rose petals bit monotonous after five days! Only one small criticism the tea and coffee in the room are a bit mean. We had just two tea bags a day (one mint and one other) and no coffee. Apparently you need to upgrade to get coffee! The better rooms have Nespresso machines.    The Hotel restaurant is very good but we did have a couple of glitches on table booking and slow service. I guess as it was busy was a good sign. One night we phoned our reservation but when we arrived at the dining room the tables were all taken. Our reservation was definitely in the book however. They tried their best to fit us in initially in front of a log fire! Then we were moved to a cooler part of the restaurant. There were apologies but to be honest maybe a free bottle of wine or something would have gone down well!    All in all you can't go wrong in booking this hotel for your Marrakesh break.

Les Jardins de la Medina,david w wrote a review Feb 2014,50,A Gem,My wife and I recently spent 5 days at Les Jardins before going on to Agadir. On arrival we were offered a glass of tea whilst we were waiting for our room to be prepared. Our room was at the further end of the delightful garden and proved to be quite large with a 4-poster bed. The buidings were from a former palace of a royal princess so they were a charming mix. On the upper floor (the solarium) there is a fine view of the city and the spectacular background of the Atlas Mountains. The garden has a heated pool many palm and other trees and at least 2 tortoises! Breakfast was laid out in the restaurant and coffee and squeezed orange juice served at the table. We usually went into the centre of the city for evening meals where there are many restaurants and food stalls in the square. Marraakech is a fascinating bustling city with so much history. We would love to go back some day and would certainly stay at this hotel again.,Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Glastonbury, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N4073AIdavidw
Les Jardins de la Medina,Chris B wrote a review Feb 2014,20,Noisy disappointing room above kitchen / goods entrance,"Booked a ""Superior Double"" for a 4 night stay at end of November. It was spacious.  However the room was on the first floor immediately above the main delivery door to the kitchen through which goods arrived from early morning. It also appeared to be the staff smoking area and general meeting place so we were disturbed very early every morning. The air-con was even noisier and we preferred not to use. On the inside (courtyard ) the bedroom windows opened immediately onto an outside staircase leading to other bedrooms so there was no privacy without closing the shutters. There was no outlook from either set of windows.

Les Jardins de la Medina,AD2468 wrote a review Feb 2014,50,Valentines getaway,Me and my husband booked this stay as a valentines getaway and we were absolutely delighted with the hotel. We were greeted at reception by Yousef who looked after us throughout our trip. The hotel itself is beautiful. On arrival we were taken to the bar to have a sit down and were given mint tea and snacks. This was a lovely thought after our journey.  We were promptly checked in and shown the grounds and our room. We booked a comfort room and it was gorgeous clean and spacious and had rose petals everywhere so romantic. The bed was very comfortable.    The food was the best food we have had in a hotel for a while. It could honestly compete with Michelin star restaurants. It was tasty superb presentation and so imaginative. We went half board and honestly it was worth it. The food is of high quality and the restaurant itself has a great atmosphere. We also had various cocktails and wines with our meals and during the stay and they were all gorgeous. The valentines day meal was great as well my husband was given a rose to present to me! We were tempted to try elsewhere but after having the food here we could not go anywhere else because it did not compare. We looked forward to it everyday. The service in the restaurant was also excellent.    On Valentines day we also wanted to go out and a taxi was organised for us. The taxi driver was so good he only took our fare at the end of the night. I have never known so much trust in tourists!    The weather was wonderful and we could sunbathe and get a tan. The terrace is the best place for quietness and is the best sun spot. This also meant we avoided the pool which the kids loved. Although the children do not bother you as it only adds to the wonderful atmosphere.    We also had massages at the spa. These were excellent! We booked a couples massage but unfortunately one of the other ladies was in an accident so my husband had to wait his turn. But this meant I could sleep in the spa treatment room whilst he had his massage done. My body felt great!    When we left we really missed this hotel we had such a wonderful time.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Hannah F wrote a review Feb 2014,40,30th in Marrakech,** They do not lie when they refer to this hotel as an Oasis. You step of the streets off of a very busy medina in Kasbah and into the quiet tranquil and exotic paradise of the hotel.  When in the hotel you would never guess what laid the otherside of the walls.  I would suggest booking airport transfers prior as Hotel a little hard to get to but being central in the old town definitely a great location only 10 - 15 minutes to the main square and market.  The staff are extremely friendly and welcoming and at your beck and call. They do everything they can to make the stay as pleasent and as relaxing as possible.  In the hotel I would recommend going to the cocktail evening they hold great way to meet other guests. No matter your age. Being 25 and my partner 29 we were probably the youngest couple staying but was still nice to chat to other tourists and hear about there experience in the City and whats good to see and do.  We booked a tour and an excursion through the hotel which are all private.  The Excursion to the mountains was great but our driver didnt speak any English. We were a little irritated as did ask for an English speaking driver. Although ignorant of us not to know another language we did say we didnt speak any french. So the journey to the mountains was in silence and we could not ask any question about the area etc. Having said this on arrival to the mountains we then paid for a further tour of the villages by an English speaking gentleman and he was excellent. I would still recommend this excursion its worth it to go to the Atalas mountains definitely.And our driver did what ever he could even trying to sign to communicate with us. He was extremely friendly.  We booked a Tour of the City with the Hotel and this was AMAZING!! Best day we had.  On arrival in Marrakech we had a bad experience in the town and it made a bit nervouse about going back. We booked the tour so we could be shown around more by a local and experiance the old town fully. Our guide was brilliant. (Mohammed) He used to be a teacher and now is a tour guide. He took us to parts of the town we would never have found ourselves and we got to see an insight into the locals. He took us not only to shops in the market but our the back up the stairs to see how things are made etc. This was well worth the money. You are on your own with the guide not a group tour. But I think this is what makes it sooo much better. Our guide was also very helpful answered all our questions and taught us so much about the city. Afterwoulds we felt so much more confident going around the market and exploring ourselves.  All in all what an AMAZING hotel. I would stay again. Definitely book a city tour. As soon as you get there if you are a bit nervouse or if its a bit of a culture shock. **,Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/906hannahf

Room was gorgeous food excellent and this time I tried the hammam which I had not done before but now know what I've been missing.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Karen M wrote a review Jan 2014,40,A missing ingredient!,Please see our full review under the restaurant section!  I don't like giving negative feedback when this hotel has so much going for it.  However as seasoned travellers for whom this was our second visit to this hotel we feel that it would be a shame for them not to reflect on the little things that let them down.  In brief.. (As the full review is in the wrong section) ....great location beautiful gardens (better than the ones we paid to visit!) lovely rooms some helpful and pleasant staff.... But....for some strange reason the female staff front desk and breakfast service lacked that desire to do more than be functional. Examples in other review but the place feels soulless and without energy. I didn't feel welcomed or special. Yet Morrocco is a warm and welcoming country. The taxi driver who drove us around in his battered little taxi took the time to draw us a map deliver us safely to and from restaurants tell us about the local area and current events call restaurants to arrange pick up...... When we visited another Riad?. Maison Arabe we felt more welcome in the 2 hours that we spent there than 3 days at Jardins de la Medina. Everyone from front of house to the barman and waiters couldn't do enough. A stark contrast to here where service isn't bad... Just lacking in warmth and going the extra mile.

Les Jardins de la Medina,MarekWNorfolk_UK wrote a review Jan 2014,50,Great hospitality for a perfect stay,We booked this hotel as part of a BA package and were not expecting too much. However Les Jardins was clean comfortable and spacious with all the facilities you'd expect from a hotel while retaining the charm of a riad. The food was excellent - lots of choice of choice for breakfast too and the gardens outdoor areas and large (for a riad) pool are a major bonus especially if you've visiting in hot weather.    Above all the staff were unfailingly friendly and helpful from the lovely breakfast manager to the bearlike doorman. They made our stay here easy. The hotel is on the edge of the medina in the relatively untouristy Kasbah district which adds to the interest when walking into town.    A couple of very minor suggestions for management:  1. We waited for quite after arrival before being shown to the room. It's nice to be welcomed with tea but after a long journey you want to clean up and get settled in first.  2. The dinner menu was excellent ‚Äì great Moroccan dishes well executed. It would be great to have a few smaller lighter dishes on the dinner menu too for those too full after lunch or who have overdosed on Tagine.

Les Jardins de la Medina,danielferias wrote a review Dec 2013,30,Lovely place but poor management,The place is quite lovely. Room 122 has a very nice private terrace. The negative aspect was related as to how one employer handled a specific situation which was not according to the minimum standards of a good hotel. The manager - self introduced as Swiss - did not handled the case correctly either. Maybe because she was misinformed by her own employee or maybee because of her own inability - which is also quite probable. Such small incident - in addition to others as a poor heated room (air conditioned was appently out of order) and too much dust in the room - shadowed what had promised to be a wonderful stay. The result is that I will not return and advise my friends to go there. La Sultana - although a different register (more luxurious) - remains my favourite. The General Manager Mr. Luc from Les Jardins de la Medina seemed to be a competent and nice person. Also Mr. Youssef from the reception is a very helpful person. But unfortunately they are not always there. Too bad that he is assisted by a swiss women who is not sensible to the guest comfort and respect (eg also a room call at 11.30 am reminding that we have to leave the room at 12.00 is of clear lack of sensitivity and disrespect !).

Les Jardins de la Medina,valbill_seddon wrote a review Dec 2013,50,'Fantastic hotel',This trip was an 80th birthday celebration and we couldn't have made a better choice. We had every comfort a wonderful super-size bed an armchair each in the bedroom an easy to use wet room an adjoining balcony and a private sun terrace on the top floor overlooking the tropical garden beneath. The complimentary water every day was a thoughtful extra plus an espresso coffee machine and an electric kettle in the room.. We had intended eating out but the food and the friendly waiter service persuaded us to stay put for our meals of which there was always a good choice. An added convenience for the disabled or elderly was a lift to each floor. The temperature in November was averaging 28 degrees which made the swimming pool a popular destination for the swimming enthusiasts. Staff on reception were very helpful in engaging taxis changing money and giving local advice and maps. Take note that the distance to the Square is about 2 miles and we found we needed a taxi which we were advised by reception would be 40d. For those staying longer than a few days choose a room on the upper floors for the sun and a solarium room for the sun plus a private rooftop sunbathing area. Also do try the cooking experience - great fun!  Our charming Hotel Director Luc Fourgere gave a cocktail party for guests whilst we were there and was regularly available to chat to guests and make suggestions of places to visit.

The food was excellent - in fact we opted to eat in the hotel most evenings rather than walk into town. My one negative comment would be the birds that flew around in the breakfast room sometimes landing on any food that was uncovered - some guests cut bread and then left the bread uncovered which was a magnet for the birds.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Kim W wrote a review Nov 2013,50,Very highly recommended - fabulous and luxurious Riad,My daughter and I stayed at this wonderful Riad for six days in October 2013. The accommodation was superb and the staff attended to your every need. I would certainly recommend this Riad to anyone visiting Marrakech. Once through the door you leave the chaotic excitement of Marrakech behind and enter a serene and luxurious paradise. Every member of staff was attentive and friendly and nothing was too much trouble. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and stay at Les Jardins de la Medina. The cookery school is certainly not to be missed. I would not hesitate to recommend this Riad and would definitely stay there again.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Sharon R wrote a review Nov 2013,40,didnt disappoint,I booked a easy jet package at this hotel and was a bit worried as I had a 'comfort room' and thought it might be a poky box room unlike the ones pictured. It was lovely...rose petals on the floor and bed and pastries in a dish. Very clean large room comfortable and as good as many I have been in. The staff were all helpful and friendly. I have to say the pool is very shaded so doesnt get warm...which might be ok when temperatures are high but during my stay it was about 26 degress and the pool was too cold. The breakfasts were very good (need a faster toaster!)...and we did have one meal in the restuarant which was quite pricey but very good...a gourmand desert for two (made up of 4 different deserts) was chocoholic heaven.  The hotel is about a 20 minute walk to the main square and souks...which doesnt sound a lot but if you do it a few times is still quite a stretch after walking around the medina and souks....and a little bit intimidating in the evening walking back to through the alleyways...although I was assured there would be not trouble. If you are older or have any trouble walking far you need to think about taxis from the hotel. I would stay here again without hesitation...,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,tonbridge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V8761TEsharonr

Les Jardins de la Medina,Maurdunn wrote a review Oct 2013,50,Beautiful peaceful - completely delightful,I spent loads of time researching riads in marrakech and had this recommended to me. I'm so pleased it was as I think it must be one of the best in the medina. Hidden away down a narrow road in the Kasbah area of the old city you can have no idea what lies behind an ancient carved doorway. The staff speak English perfectly and are so helpful and polite. The gardens are amazing - the largest in the medina and full of palm trees bougainvillea and so many delightful birds. The pool is a good size and there are plenty of outside sitting and relaxing areas. We loved the rooftop space - big comfy white sofas and loungers including a hammock! The restaurant is lovely - although a little pricey it compares well with other riad restaurants. The spinach salad is excellent and the grilled fish good too. Lovely red and Gris (morrocan rose) wines too. We chose a solarium room which comes with its own private roof top space. Worth the extra for the privacy I think.

We ate the restaurant where the food was very tasty and well presented; we used the spa which was wonderful but the gym facilities could be improved. Lovely personal touches of fresh pastries brought to your room every night being invited for complimentary drinks on Friday night and brunch on Sunday was unexpected and really special.

Very special place read loads of reviews but settled n this hotel. So glad we did was just a beautiful welcoming attentive but not overbearing place to stay. Nothing was too much trouble and they made lovely little touches to our room. Toiletries in the room are gorgeous the pool is chilly but once in a welcome cool off and great size for a swim unlike the plunge pools at raids. It took us about 20-25 minutes to walk to the main square mainly because of the various distractions along the way. Found it hard to leave the hotel on the first day was so relaxing! Amazing breakfast an abundance of food and the owners were extremely welcoming with a cocktail/wine evening first night. No pressure or talk just a easygoing welcome drink where you can meet other guests/staff if you choose to do so.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Diana H wrote a review Sep 2013,50,Kasbah Oasis,This is a beautiful restful place to stay in Marrakech. It is located in the Kasbah and a 20 minute walk to Jemaa el-Fnaa the main square of Marrakesh. We stayed 4 nights. After exploring the busy streets and souks it is a real delight to step back into this Riad with it's lovely garden and pool area to relax in. Our room which was on the first floor was very nicely furnished kept beautifully clean everyday and we also had a small terrace which looked out over the pool/garden area. The staff were always friendly and helpful and the restaurant excellent. We would recommend visitors try the traditional Morrocan breakfast it's delicious.  The Riad staff are very helpful at arranging guides excursions money exchange taxis drivers etc. Nothing was too much trouble. The hotel staff arranged for us on our first day an English speaking guide to escort us around. He took us through all the little alleyways local shortcuts and back streets which were very interesting telling us of the history of where we were walking which was great. Without our guides local road knowledge we could have got hopelessly lost in the maze which is the Kasbah if we had wandered around there alone. After that day though we stuck to the main roads and had no problems getting around. The locals are very helpful though it helps if you speak French,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Brisbane, Queensland, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/65dianah
Les Jardins de la Medina,dears99 wrote a review Sep 2013,50,medina magic,Stayed here for five nights with my wife who has always wanted to stay in a riad. You enter the hotel through a doorway off a narrow street into reception then on into the lovely garden and pool area. We had a room on the 1st floor which was enormous with 2 seating areas and a large bathroom with superb toiletries. Service and food were very good a little expensive but proportional to eating in decent restaurants. The hotel is just inside the city walls and to reach the centre you have to walk about twenty minutes through the Kasbah which we did several times even late at night and felt very safe. You could get a taxi but you would miss out an experience which was like walking through a film set.,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dears99

The food was excellent if a tad expensive similar to European prices. Our room was lovely cleaned twice a day and above the room up a little stair case we had our own private terrace. It is a little paradise.    The choice of food for breakfast was excellent . The only criticism I could make was the breakfast service. You had to ask several times for tea or coffee the tables were often not re set if you came down a little later and staff didn't clear your dishes very quickly. I did mention this to the manager who was most professional and offered my daughter and I a free massage.

On arrival you pass through narrow busy streets where locals are going about their daily business. You then pass through Le Jardin de la Medina's door and are transported into an oasis of calm. With excellent service and a friendliness the riad has a lovely pool area as well as a traditional feel with elements of luxury added. We used the hotel as a base for a week and they arranged drivers and local guides who took us to the Atlas Mountains. All quietly and efficiently organised. We were located about a 25 minutes walk to the main square which was always an interesting journey!

Once you stepped through the door you felt safe and could relax. The food was very good in fact some was excellent - the dinner was the best I had whilst in Marrakech but the menu description did not do justice to the dish that was served. A simple starter you might think described as 'Spinach and preserved lemons' does not conjour up the delicious spinach and lemon mix three part course that was produced! loved the Moroccan salad that was served with its interesting component parts. Breakfast was a little lacklustre and service did not seem inspired. Bedroom was beautifully clean and well serviced only complaint was that there was no extractor fan in the bathroom but discovering a small window which could be opened reduced this problem.

I stayed two nights and was upgraded to a Sultana room (115) which was spacious quiet and well-appointed in a mix of Moroccan and Western decor. Outside temperatures were 100+ degrees F/39 C so I greatly appreciated the shaded room and patio quiet air conditioning and rainfall shower.

The bed was very comfortable. The restaurant is relatively expensive as hotel restaurants usually are but sometimes it's good to just stay in and I had nothing but well-made food from the restaurant (a delicious seafood tagine intensely-flavored harira lovely berber omelette and freshly-made batbouts from the breakfast buffet)..

Les Jardins de la Medina,Hoa-an B wrote a review Jul 2013,30,Good riad but needs improvements,LOCATION  South end within the medina roughly 10 minutes walk from the main square Jeema el Fna. Because of its location inside the old town some may call the immediate surroundings authentic some may just call it dirty and crammed. You have to walk through some back streets to get to the hotel.    GOOD  Beautiful lush garden and lovely pool. It's definitely a nice and tranquil escape from the city outside. The rooms are well appointed and there's a lush rustic charm in the interior design rather than opulent luxury. You definitely feel like you are in a Moroccan riad with character and not another large international hotel. You also get free N'espresso and bottled water in the room. Personable service and the front of hour staff are very friendly and helpful particularly with restaurant recommendations.    BAD  The in-house restaurant. Terrible breakfast with limited food selection. Some of the food on display seemed to have been out for a long time and the pastry was dry. If you are used to the larger hotels' breakfast be prepared to lower your expectations. Our lunch didn't really improve either so we ended up not eating there again. The rustic charm in the rooms can easily be seen as tired by some. The aircon in both rooms that we had were noisy and one of them broke down in the middle of one night. Finally the hotel charged 350 MAD (¬£26) for airport transfer for a journey that last precisely 6:30 minutes from door to door in a dirty and tired-looking Hyundai. Seriously?!    SUMMARY  I stayed at Les Jardins de la Medina with my partner and my parents for a long weekend 11-14 July 2013. I have also stayed here before in 2007. Both my stays are good and the riad can be recommended but it needs to improve its breakfast offering and quality as well as the airport transfer before I can give it my full endorsement.,Date of stay: July 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Tamarama, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hoa-anB

Les Jardins de la Medina,Lynne P wrote a review Jul 2013,40,Luxury in central Marrakech,We wanted a romantic retreat to celebrate our 25th Wedding Anniversary and my birthday. Most of the boxes were ticked - but a long wait for our room upon arrival and some plumbing issues which resulted in two changes of room did spoil things a little. The hotel over-compensated for this with gifts and hospitality for both our 'special celebration' complete with Oud player and my birthday - champagne cake and waiters singing to me in Arabic! We really enjoyed the cookery course which was just the two of us the chef and a member of the waiting team to translate and help. The pool area is lovely and relaxed yet strangely crowded on the Sunday we were there - think that there were people visiting residents. In particular the location excellent if you are sightseers as you can brave most of the main attractions on foot or they are a short taxi ride away.

The rooms are well appointed clean and quiet. In our two visits this year we had rooms on the ground floor which opened onto the garden. The garden is well kept and contains a pool. The pool area is maybe a bit on the small side and does get a bit crowded at times. The restaurant serves excellent food expensive maybe but a bit special. They have a really good chef.    Seek out this hotel and you will not be disappointed.,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"West Malling, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/a_johnson12
Les Jardins de la Medina,Karen M wrote a review Jun 2013,50,Hidden Gem...should be rated higher!,We stayed here last August having read all of the reviews and were not disappointed. Finding it by car was not something I would recommend. Our sat nab was hopeless and although we were in the medina the small streets are not car friendly so next time we might leave the car and hire it later! The hotel was a hidden oasis in a dusty street... Rooms and pool area fabulous and dinner was lovely although eating out in the main square is an experience not to be missed. We will certainly stay again if in Marrakech!,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bishops Stortford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/846karenm846

Les Jardins de la Medina,Rachel G wrote a review Jun 2013,50,First class stay in every way...,We booked Les Jardins mainly based on previous trip advisor reviews. We wanted something that had a good size pool great location and five star feel with authentic morrocan feel. I'm pleased to say the hotel meet our expectations and beyond.    The staff are friendly and very knowledgable. Perfect location 15min walk to the main square. Excellent food breakfast is included and is fit for a king! We dined in the restaurant and were extremely pleased with the quality of food and service. We enjoyed sightseeing in the mornings before it got too hot then would enjoy relaxing by the pool till early evening. A tip if hungry by the poolside order club sandwiches. They're not on the menu but delicious!! I highly recommend great mini break....,Date of stay: May 2013,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RachelG80

The hotel is within easy walking distance of Place Jamaa El Fna and the hustle and bustle of the souks.  Short transfer from the airport maybe 10-15 mins and once behind the front door of the hotel is a haven of calm away from the busy streets of Marrakech.  Staff very helpful and friendly rooms clean and well presented over-looking the gardens which offer plenty of shade when temperatures are soaring.

Staff are friendly and really helpful. Our bedroom was so pretty. Rose petals everywhere! just lovely. The food was excellent. Just one tiny problem (and i'm not sure how they could fix this) there's only a small amount of sunbeds in the sun so there's a bit of a scramble to bag yourself a bed. I had to move to find a sunny spot and then back to my bed in the shade. However i did find a rooftop terrace with more beds in direct sunlight so all was ok. i don't know how they manage though when the hotel is full.

Les Jardins de la Medina,thatblokeDon wrote a review May 2013,40,Excellent... but not perfect,We stayed here for 6 nights for our 'Babymoon' and had a great holiday. We were looking for a relaxing holiday with some shopping good food and culture thrown in and we found it. Overall we loved the hotel and its team of friendly staff and would recommend it to our friends however it wasn't completely perfect which is why I would give it either 4 or 4.5 instead of 5 stars.    Location:    Convenient but not central. The Jemaa-el-Fna Square is about a 20min walk away or a 50dh cab ride. In fact everything is about a 50-60dh cab ride away.    Room:    Nice and comfortable but not great. This is a riad so the rooms have a lot of character and charm however the shower screen in our bathroom was too small so after every shower the floor would be flooded. I found the bed too hard for my liking and the pillows too soft so I did not sleep as well as I would have liked. My heavily pregnant wife didn't seem to mind it so maybe it was just me. Some rooms have outdoor space but ours didn't. I would try and get one with a verandah if you can.    Amenities:    The pool is the big selling point here. Reserve a bed early by dropping one of the provided sun hats before having breakfast and laze the morning away in one of the largest private gardens in the Medina. It really is an oasis.    Restaurant:    Great food but European prices.    Staff:    Very friendly and helpful and who speak perfect English for those of us with rusty French and no Arabic. Don't bother asking for restaurant recommendations though as they will refer to the 'Best Restaurants in Marrakech' book and will be expensive for what you get.    Breakfast:    A good selection of western and local fare as well as eggs cooked to order.    Conclusion:    Overall we enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to our friends. We relaxed shopped explored and looked forward to returning out this oasis in the Medina every day.,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thatblokeDon

Les Jardins de la Medina,Wulfart wrote a review Apr 2013,50,Orange blossom oasis,Excellent hotel within the medina. The gardens provide a lush oasis to retreat to after visits to the busy medina and souks. The pool is beautiful and the rooms are luxurious.  The staff can be quite loud as they arrive for duties and do not seem concerned at all about waking you with loud voices and noisy duties.  The restaurant was very nice. The dinner menu is a bit limited if you plan on eating at the hotel more than once.  The breakfast table was busy with birds eating the uncovered pastries.  The four hand massage is highly recommended.  The roof deck is delightful but has an awful sewer like odor that sometimes blows over the space.

The gardens are beautiful and there is also a pool for those wishing to swim or to soak up the sun. Food - lunch good but dinner was disappointing.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Ifu wrote a review Mar 2013,50,a diamond in the rough...,We discovered the Jardins de la Koutoubia via the internet and friends reviews as often on Trip Advisor were a mixed bag although overall good so we had to make up our own mind.  I would say it's a diamond in the rough. This former playground for the royals has the most amazing gardens. Some trees date back to the 19th century so does the house it's the first thing that strikes you once you pass the door from the buzzy and busy streets of the surrounding Medina.  IF you want a Medina experience and IF you can't afford some of those very pricey riads/guests houses(price=better???) that have grown by the million in the red city then go for this one. Manage your expectations that's all. The food goes from simple to elaborate no need to hunt for food in the neighborhood from classic French to Moroccan and Thai all in the safe hands of a lady Chef. The drink list ranging from soft coffee and wines is of excellent value for money and at least you don't feel being piggy bagged like most tourist traps in this city eg. Chassagne-Montrachet for a mere 68Euros or Petit Chablis for 45 Euros Moroccan wines are also sold at a very decent price so you can have fun and explore. Great value for money overall.  Service is friendly and smart the restaurant is charming the views from the roof top terraces are great. The owners/hoteliers Michel and Luc are great hosts if you happen to meet them and they can tell you the History of the place and take great care of their guests and the property keep it up.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Rhodes wrote a review Mar 2013,50,Fabulous oasis in Marrakech,We spent 4 wonderful days in this Riad - probably the most beautiful hotel we have stayed in. We stayed in a Solarium room which had a small balcony and - the best bit - a private solarium up a flight of stairs which catches the sun all day. Ideal at this time of year when the rest of the hotel is designed to cope with intense sunshine. The garden is really lovely with seating areas dotted about. We enjoyed the buffet breakfast and ate 3 excellent meals in the evening. True the service can be a bit hap hazard - we saw a number of occasions when the waiter clearly didn't know who they were supposed to be bringing a plate of food to! But it was generally warm and friendly. The pool is heated - again a bonus at this time of year. The Riad is well south of the main square but we enjoyed the walk and the variety of interesting places to visit.

Les Jardins de la Medina,GaddyH wrote a review Feb 2013,50,Les Jardins ticks all the boxes,This is a hotel of great character and comfort located in the Kasbah area. Situated on an unobtrusive street the old wooden front door gives little clue as to the elegant and sophisticated establishment within. This hotel is really a great refuge (and antidote) to the hurley-burley and often full-on nature of Marrakech street life outside. The gardens filling the central courtyard are luxuriant. The dining room is large with an antique atmosphere and with a background aroma of woodsmoke and spices. Meals are served with a sense of style & occasion by the atentive staff. My wife son and I shared a well-appointed room for our stay which was quite big enough for the double plus extra bed. The room was located off a small and intimate courtyard with table chairs and bubbling fountain (turned off at night). TV channels included BBC (so you can compare the rotten British weather with that outside). Don't forget to try the comfy chairs and settees up on the roof terrace listen to the doves watch the storks flying overhead and enjoy views over to the Koutoubia Mosque tower on one side and the distant Atlas mountains on the other. Or the pool in hot weather. We didn't try it but there is lots of pampering on offer (massage spa treatments etc). If we decided to return to Marrakech les Jardins de la Medina would be our first choice. You will hear the Muezzins' call (which adds to the atmosphere I guess) and rooms nearest the outside streets may pick up the occasional moped and voices out- of-hours (not many cars use the streets which are too narrow for anything bigger than a people carrier). I should add that all the staff work constantly to keep this hotel on the top line and are very courteous and helpful. English is spoken by the Reception staff and a little by the dining room staff but French is the main European language spoken.,Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaddyH

Doors opened from the room onto a garden/paved area. looking towards some exercise machines and the pool. Room was always spotlessly clean plenty of towels that seemed new with rose petals strewn over them (every day)! V. comfy bed. Super rooftop terrace with loungers a view of the Atlas mountains beyond. Buffet breakfast had fresh fruit and juice meats smoked salmon bread pastries you could order an omelette.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Ravensk1 wrote a review Feb 2013,40,Your every need catered for - nothing is too much.,We stayed as a couple for 4 nights in February. We booked through the hotel in advance for taxi collection from the airport which ran like clockwork and was much appreciated. I also booked an Orange Blossom massage which was lovely. The reception staff were outstanding - nothing was too much for them. They helped with negotiating for taxis booking restaurants and giving hints for the obligatory trip to the souks. The welcome tea and fruits were much appreciated as was the cocktail party on our final night which gave us a chance to talk to the other guests.    There are three types of room at this hotel: Superior Solarium and Sultana. We had decided to splash out on a Sultana room which had a large private terrace (room 115). The only problem here was that it was in permanent shade. This is probably welcome in the summer months but in February we would have preferred more sunshine so in hindsight we should have booked a solarium room. We had one day of torrential rain and the terrace never dried out after that - in fact my husband was sitting at the outside table one day when a torrent of water was thrown down from the suite above. In essence we never managed to use the terrace preferring instead to either sit by the pool or on the top terrace to catch some much needed sunshine. The room came with a huge bathroom with robes and slippers and a nespresso machine with 6 complimentary coffees included and mini bar/frige. There were pastries and fruit waiting for us in the room but these were never replenished during our stay and the same pastries were still there 4 days later. The complimentary daily water was much appreciated.    We ate in the restaurant on two occasions. The food was very good but the service here is a bit intermittent. On the first night we felt that the service was very rushed - no sooner had we finished our starter and the main course was there. In complete contrast to this we had lunch one day and had to wait an hour between starter and main as the waiter had taken down our order wrongly and appeared with two plates of meat which was a problem as vegetarians. Breakfast was plentiful. Eggs as you choose to have them plus lots of fruit yoghurt and breads. It really set us up for the day.    This hotel allows no residents to use the pool area for a fee. As only half of the poolside area is ever in sunshine it did mean that loungers were a bit limited for the guests. It would be an idea if residents were able to have complimentary usage of the Hamman as part of their stay. There is a small shop selling local items which was lovely and the smell of Orange Blossom hand wash is still in my mind.    There is a Hamman on site and a small 'spa'. The hamman we didn't use as the 200 dhs charge for this we felt was rather excessive considering you could only use it for 30 mins. The spa which is situated on the top floor consisted of a couple of massage rooms as far as I could make out but the massage I had was lovely. It would have been helpful to have the full list of treatments available prior to booking.    We had a lovely time. The hotel is great and all the little touches make it an outstanding place to stay. We will definitely be returning.,Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Ealing, London",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ravensk1
Les Jardins de la Medina,Giboos wrote a review Feb 2013,40,Oasis from the Marrakech Madness,My husband and I stayed for 3 nights recently ‚Äì check in was smooth and we were provided with extensive information about the hotel. From the moment we stepped into the hotel I felt relaxed. We were greeted with mint tea and a tower of dried fruits consisting of dates apricots and sultanas which was a lovely touch whilst our bags were transported to the room. The hotel is small and intimate and true to form of a riad has a beautiful garden inside the walls of the hotel which is instantly relaxing ‚Äì inclusive of baby turtles roaming freely that are said to bring good luck.    Now for the room ‚Äì it was sensational. There seemed to be such awesome attention paid to detail. A wood fire if you wish n-espresso coffee maker roses fruits platters and complimentary bottles of water refreshed daily.  Then there is the bed ‚Äì super comfortable!!! I fell in love with this bed - I could have spent all day there.    Some negatives:  The fitness centre was outside and almost non-existent so if you are keen to work out during your stay ‚Äì bring a work out DVD (as we did) or have a plan up your sleeve.    Day spa was not so hot ‚Äì my husband and I had a couples massage and unfortunately it was the worst massage I have ever had and paid for. My masseuse was getting directions from my husband‚Äôs masseuse whilst I was having my massage.    Restaurant service was also questionable. The food was of excellent quality and delicious however it was let down by the hap hazard service from staff. Plates at breakfast were never cleared away ‚Äì I watched other guests putting plates on the seats next to them as they had no room on their table left as staff walked merrily by not aware that this is something that should be attended too.    We went to the restaurant for dinner once and the service was slow and clunky. At the end of the night we would have been interested in the dessert menu which was not offered we did order coffee but after the protracted time that it took to get it we were exhausted. The restaurant was not busy and there were adequate amounts of staff so there should have been no excuses at all for the poor service.    The staff members seemed as though they were trying hard ‚Äì busily running around the place but were not effective with what they were trying to achieve ‚Äì they need more training.    There also was a severe lack of service by the pool. We spent 2 full Marrakech winter-sun filled days by the pool and each time we would have to try desperately to get the attention of the staff to make an order for food or drinks. This needs to be addressed as it is a let-down for an otherwise really great stay.    We had a great time in Marrakech ‚Äì we spent a lot of time in the riad as it was lovely overall but needs some work for it to be exceptional.,Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Western Australia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Giboos

Les Jardins de la Medina,Eva_Loge wrote a review Feb 2013,50,Fantastic hotel with perfect food,We stayed in Les jardin de la Medina for one week in January for my husband's birthday. The staff and atmosphere were very nice. Good service and helpful for everything that we asked for. They have a very good restaurant too. At the beginning we planned to try different restaurant in marrakech . But we found out from the first dinner that we already have the best in the town. At the end we decided to have all our 7 dinners in our hotel . We are owner of restaurant in norway so we know what Is Good food mean.They served amazing food and the service was excellent. Specially on my husband birthday they prepared the soft cake which my husband used to have for his birthday in norway. The servers even came over with the cake and sang the birthday song for him in front of our table. We will definitely coming back.,Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Oppegard, Norway",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eva_Loge
Les Jardins de la Medina,Ivar L wrote a review Feb 2013,40,Nice premises and good service,"Stayed one week with my wife and overall it was a nice experience. The room (131) was spacious and not too much noise from the street outside. It lacked balcony or terrace but that was not a big problem. Some of the rooms on the ground floor seemed to be smaller and lack of privacy on the small terrace.  We had a bust-up with the manager on arrival because we had no internet connection but that was solved in a remarkable way by putting up a ""box"" high up in a tree outside our room.  The food and service in the restaurant was so good that we had dinner there all 7 nights - the Morrocan wines were very good also.",Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IvarL_13

There were lots of nice touches all around the place and the atmosphere and the food were excellent. The breakfast in particular was generous. The bedroom was very comfortable and well warmed (in January.) We enyoyed the gardens the roof terrace and pool. We had to remind ourselves we were there ot go out and do some sightseeing. (The town of Marrakech slightly disappointed us and so it was tempting to stay in the nice confines of the hotel.)    The restaurant was not cheap and so we chose to eat out some times but as we had got what we felt was a good rate for bed and breakfast through the travel company we booked with overall it represented reasonable value.    If pressed to identify shortcomings I would say that the waitresses in the restaurant at breakfast were a little slow to clear dirty plates and the serivce at dinner was leisurely.,Date of stay: January 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Tonbridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nmgm835

Les Jardins de la Medina,frostedtreasures wrote a review Feb 2013,20,Service a real let down,"Firstly I apologise for the following long winded review. I have never written such a poor review and because of that and the fact I was so disappointed I wanted to ensure I explained as fully as possible why this was the case. I was so looking forward to our first trip to Morocco and in particular our stay at Les Jardins de la medina having read all of its great reviews on Tripadvisor. The choice came down to here and La Maison Arabe both seemed to be equally good but in the end it was the inviting pictures of the pool area at Les Jardins that made our decision. Only going for 3 nights we wanted our visit to be really special.  First the good....    The gardens and outdoor areas- these are immaculate and a real oasis of calm away from the chaos that is Marrakech. Although it is true as others have said that there is alot of shade unless you are lucky enough to get one of the the few loungers at the sunny side of the pool. We spent most of our time on the roof terrace which was lovely and quiet although a little ironic as the pool was one of the reasons we chose this hotel.    The cleanliness of the room was superb - it was a good size with a big bed and furnished to a very high standard the rose petals being a lovely finishing touch. The housekeeping staff clearly work very hard. We had a superior room but i found ours room 127 to be a bit too enclosed the only windows opened out to a small shaded high walled courtyard and although a patio set was provided you wouldnt really want to sit out there. The more expensive rooms did have lovely open patio areas however so it comes down to what you are willing to pay.    The choice at breakfast was plentiful with a good selection of breads juices meats cheese pastries moroccan pancakes and fresh fruit.    Sadly all the impressive surroundings and luxury furnishings cannot make up for the poor service and attitude of staff and I am sorry to say that is our overwhelming impression of the front of house service we received at Les Jardins de la Medina.( I should have perhaps had an inkling of their attitude when i on booking I enquired about the costs of a transfer from the airport the cost being double that of a private transfer I ended up booking via Travel republic so be warned!.....)    - On arrival @ 7.30pm instead of being showed to our room for a quick relax and freshen up before dinner as we would have liked ( we had made a reservation from the UK earlier that week for dinner at the hotel for 8.30pm) we were asked to take a seat enjoy a welcome drink and would then shown to our room. There was no tables left in the small bar area so we were placed outside devoid of any atmosphere and finally after a lengthy wait where i thought we had been forgotton about a mint tea and some dried fruits arrived.  Having made our way back to the bar/ restaurant area just after 8.30pm for dinner we were shown to a table not in the main restaurant as we wrongly expected but at the far side of an uninspiring awning which acts as an extension. There were a couple of patio heaters already at other empty tables but we were seated far away from these and it does get pretty cold in the evening in Morocco at this time of year!( hence roaring log fires in the main restaurant!!! )Strangely there were still empty tables in the main restaurant which i found a little odd as a had booked several days before. I asked if we could be nearer a heater and a waitress rather grumpily moved our table nearer to an empty table which had the benefit of a patio heater. After another fairly lengthy wait we were given the menu with no communication or pleasantries. We were unaware when we booked that Friday was a ""Moroccan Evening"" a fixed three course menu offering limited choices at a cost of around ¬£40 a head before drinks. Neither my husband nor I particularly wanted three courses that evening the choices were not terribly inspiring let alone the surroundings and service thus far and sadly we were totally put off and chose to get up and leave explaining this to the barman on our way out as the waitress had vanished. By this point we could'n't be bothered to venture out for dinner with no knowledge of our surroundings so went to bed somewhat hungry and disappointed.  Next morning the service at breakfast followed somewhat the same pattern. Being a buffet breakfast staff only had to concentrate on offering coffee/tea etc clearing away pots and pleasantries. There is unobtrusive service which is great and what i expected this would be and then there is lack of service and attention. Each of the 3 mornings at breakfast i would have to try and get the attention of the waiting staff or wait for them to reappear from elsewhere to refill my coffee. Used crockery piled up on our table with no one seeming to want to remove them despite the fact there was no space left on the table in the end I had to call someone over and ask them to remove them.  On our final night we had a lovely evening meal in the medina and thought we would return to the hotel for a coffee and dessert. We asked if that would be OK  which it was and sat in the bar area. We waited for a waitress to come with a menu despite there being two bar staff chatting in the empty bar and waited.. she finally brought the menu we waited again...... I finally went up to the bar and asked if i could order with them and was told the waitress would be coming over but they offered to do the coffee now we waited once more ... i had drank all my coffee and we were still waiting.....needless to say we got up and left AGAIN! If the restaurant had been busy and everyone was engaged i could have understood it but that was not the case. By this point I was really quite upset and voiced my concerns to reception who simply handed me a customer comment form to complete. One further note we exchanged currency at the hotel whilst there and when we asked if we could change it back on the morning of our departure we were told abruptly that was not possible and to try the airport. I know currency controls are stringent in Morocco but even if that were the truth her attitude left alot to be desired.    At first I wondered if our constant lack of service was due to having walked out of the restaurant on our first night  then i feared it may be because we were English as the hotel has a large French clientele and staff speak little english ( I can manage a little french) but then i noticed that the staff were much more attentive and pleasant with the elderly ""posh"" English guests who perhaps are a little less confident travellers and wouldn't dream of complaining and of course guaranteed to give good tips.... so I am very confused!. My husband and I are always happy to pay a premium for quality and service but we are certainly not gullible paying well over the odds for poor service and our stay here left a bad taste in my mouth.",Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frostedtreasures
Les Jardins de la Medina,geotripper wrote a review Feb 2013,40,I'll stay here again in a heartbeat,Recently stayed here with my husband and 11-month old and their attention to detail was impeccable. We requested a baby cot and not only did we find it when we arrived we also found they'd put in a bottle warmer and baby bathtub as well. I was instantly sold. I love the tranquilness of the place. Our room had its own patio with stairs which led up to our own sunroof complete with lounge cars. Breakfast was enjoyable and they make omelettes on order too. The only reason I didn't give it the full five stars was because there weren't any electric coffee makers/hot water kettles in the room for coffee and tea. Traveling with an infant those mini kettles always come in handy. Other than that I loved this property. The attentiveness of the staff was exceptional its location in the Kasbah quarter of the Medina was convenient and I'll probably stay here again.,Date of stay: January 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Stockholm, Sweden",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geotripper
Les Jardins de la Medina,Scotty062 wrote a review Feb 2013,50,A wonderful experience,"Our stay here was a family birthday present for my wife and we thoroughly enjoyed the luxury - a marked contrast to the chaos of the medina and the rather unpromising street entrance to the hotel. Several of our evening meals were enjoyed in the medina's central square - a world away from the quiet and refined atmosphere of the hotel's dining-room.  I made good use of the hotel's rooftop solarium and of the pleasantly heated swimming pool.  The breakfast was excellent with a very wide range of food beautifully presented and we particularly looked forward to the daily special ""vitamin juice"" with beetroot a favourite.  All the staff were attentive and helpful but my personal award would go to the maids who looked after our room - I don't think I have ever before experienced such a high standard of service.  Add a week of clear blue skies (albeit a bit chilly early and late) and our Marrakech visit could not have been better.",Date of stay: January 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Scottish Highlands, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scotty062
Les Jardins de la Medina,steve c wrote a review Feb 2013,30,very relaxing -but!,The hotel (it isnt a Riad) is very tranquil and a quiet place to relax from the madness of Marrakech. Take a good look at the photos the whole place is in constant shade. The sun only reaches one side of the swimming pool and not on the pool itself.The only other place for sun is on the roof terrace which is fine but you will have to go down three flights of stairs to order a drink. We had a Sultan room which is the most expensive. we were on the ground floor and had a nice little terrace but no sun. In the morning it would have been nice to sit in the sun with a coffee but it was quite dark although we could see the sun was on the roof. I accept we went at the end of January but it was 28 degrees and the palm trees are so tall i cant see the sun getting through at any time of the year.  The service is very slow and at meal times you do have to go and get someone to serve you as they dont seem to look out for people who need something.  The breakfast is fine providing you dont want anything hot (not an unusual problem with buffet breakfasts)  The hotel is quite small and i would think too small when crowded at other times of the year.  Everything was exceptionally clean and the staff couldnt do enough for you.  We did enjoy our visit but not the hotel for sun lovers which we are.

Les Jardins de la Medina,gogreenandtravel wrote a review Jan 2013,40,Splendor in the Medina....,This is hotel is BEAUTIFUL -- the rooms are elegant and the gardens are lush and stunning -- you can hardly believe that you are in the middle of the medina. Marrakech can be a little frenetic and this hotel is quite a retreat! We LOVED the heated swimming pool -- it was completely delightful in chilly January.    The service is good just a little formal for my particular tastes. I really think that they should warm things up a bit. I can not put my finger on it but after smiling welcomes in Fez and throughout the country the service here just felt too formal.    The food is good. Dinner was delicious and breakfast had some real high points -- -- I particularly loved the surprise of each morning's freshly pressed juice smoothie -- a deep red beet concoction one day and vibrant green cucumber/kiwi mix the other.    My family much needed the safe oasis this hotel provided. It was actually a perfect transition out of Morocco... I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a strong touch of Euope in their Moroccan vacation.

Overall this hotel is excellent the staff very friendly along with service to match. Only minor negative is the location which is on the outskirts of the old town and many of the attractions however if you don't mind walking then this shouldn't be a concern.

Hard to know where it came from. But it was a little gross but hard to know whether to blame the hotel or not in this region.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Trilingualtravels wrote a review Dec 2012,30,Expected more,I stayed in this Hotel last week upon arrival we were greeted with a tea and some dates and apricots in the little outside area. I think the only way for me to give this Hotel a good review is by doing a pros and cons list as there were so many good but also bad things.  The good things are that the rooms are very clean (cleaned 2 a day) staff is f riendly and helpful and the roof terrace is great with amazing views.  The bad things unfortunately theres a lot more service from the bar is very slow one night we actually waited 25 mins for a cocktail with only one order before ours. The coktails are quite expensive compared to other places and a pack of crisps is 5 Euros the bar doesnt have a big selection also when sat in the bar area in the winter time its quite smoky due to the open fire and on top people smoking inside it stings your eyes if youre not used to it.  Breakfast is not too bad even though dont come too early it says from 7:00 - 10:30 but we came at 7:30 and they were still decorating tables bringing food out and rearanging everything the worse thing was as it was quite cold the gas heaters were only turned on when people started arriving so it wasalways very cold at breakfast and the who we thought might be the morning manager as he was always round breakfast in a suit was even worse because everytime he arrived he started moving tables chairs just making a lot of noise in general which wasnt very nice when your trying to enjoy breakfast. Also scrambled egg was always cold but you can order an omlette if wanted at least thats hot. Selection of fresh fruit was good. The dinner in the Hotel was okay but overrated in my eyes we had dinner in so many other places for less money and better quality but I guess it depends on everyones taste.  If you like sleeping dont stay in 128 its directly over the kitchen and laundry room and gets very noisy from 6 am which is why my mum had to change rooms. I was in 133 the room had no little terrace in fact i couldnt even open my windows because my privacy would have been invaded and when my neighbours came in at 2am the walls are that thin that i thought they were in my room I could hear everything also when i was in the bathroom I could hear everything that happened on the roofterrace including conversations. Allthough the bed was okay I couldnt sleep due to noise from everywhere like doors closing (not one hotel door in this facility closes quietly)  the street the roof terrace my neighbours etc. After the room change my mum moved to 130 which was nice but very damp and cold the heater in bathroom was behind a cupboard so it didnt heat at all and there was a lot of mold which I will include pictures of. Tv was very small but you dont need a tv on holiday it had 2 english channels and one german all the other were french. Also big problem i had was the way to my room was not covered so I got wet everytime I had to walk to my room but at least there was umbrellas in the room.  The Pool area and garden area is a big plus for this Hotel also the roof terrace all in all I think this Hotel has a lot of potential but just needs some more TLC in general.  In my eyes its not a Rhiad its a Hotel and at the moment it doesnt deserve the valuation it has not due too staff but because of facilities and little things it just seems that the staff are trying everything but there seems to be a manager missing that makes sure things are going like they should. One day while in the bar having a drink we got asked to move tables 3 times because they were doing maintenace work now Im a paying guest and want some peace and quiet but all I heard most afternoons was drilling etc. Would I stay again probably not I think there is better places in Marrakech for better value. Again its not the staff but everything else.,Date of stay: November 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Lucerne, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trilingualtravels
Les Jardins de la Medina,rcd77 wrote a review Dec 2012,50,Tranquil oasis amongst the bustling city streets of Marrakech.,"We spent our honeymoon here at the end of November 2012 and cannot recommend this riad highly enough. Admittedly this was our first trip to Marrakech so have little to compare it too but from the moment we arrived the Jardins de la medina felt like the perfect place to stay. All staff were attentive and friendly throughout our stay welcoming us with a drink in the bar and a tour of the gardens while our room was prepared with candles and rose petals (they even serviced the room twice a day). We had a double superior room on the ground floor which was a good size had a large shower/wet room and comfortable lounge space with 14""tv (the sultan rooms have larger tvs). It also opened onto a small private outside seating area which was shaded but pleasant (the solarium rooms all seem to have private 3rd floor outdoor spaces to catch the sun). The communal roof terrace though has 5 sun beds and lots of other seating giving awsome views of the mountains and the city. The location was good with the main square and other attractions within 10-15 mins walk (depending how many people stop you on the way!). The entire complex seems much larger than other riads in this district with substantial gardens and a good sized heated pool. The restaurant is superb although being veggie we were limited to tagines and pasta the location is handy for other nearby restaurants though (try the kasbah cafe down the road for a cheaper alternative menu). In summary this is a beautiful place to stay and were we to return to Marrakech we would stay here again.",Date of stay: November 2012,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rcd77

We stayed for 3 nights and will definitely return. The staff were extremely helpful and professional and made you feel that nothing was too much trouble. Our room was beautiful with a balcony overlooking the pool area and there were exotic vegetation to look at from every view. Fortunately we were able to have some treatments whilst at the hotel and found the staff to be knowledgeable professional and extremely nice. The food was exquisite with an amazing amount of choice - especially for breakfast.

After the frantic souks this was a relaxing experience that all of us girls completely appreciated - in fact we could quite easily have stayed and shared another bottle of wine!!  The food was brilliant (the portions on the salad starter is huge!) and the service impeccable.

The rooms are excellent some having a sofa area  some having an external patio and upstairs ""solarium"" sunning area. You can also laze around the pool or sun yourself on the roof areas - very relaxing .

So peaceful in such a busy city too. ALL the staff were polite courteous and very attentive. Nothing being too much trouble. When we arrived we were sitting awaiting our welcome drink and nibbles (together with a welcome cold flannel) and the manager came up asking if we were being attended to. That same manager showed a low profile presence throughout our stay. He seemed to have a great rappor with his staff who seemed eager to adhere to his very high standards.  Our room was immaculate and the little extras like the basket with the fans the straw hats and the towels were an example of the thoughtfulness gone into making any stay at this hotel so special but yet so relaxing. We are more than keen to revisit Marakesch and Les Jardins will be the hotel we return to. It is in a brilliant location too. Amongst the Moroccon people going about their everyday life.  Oh and the breakfast was superb every item being replenished to keep up the display of a wonderful choice of food.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Carlos8357 wrote a review Sep 2012,50,Surprising and wonderful oasis in La Kasbah,Les Jardins de la Medina is a wonderful boutique hotel in the Kasbah area of Marrakesh. It is located on a quiet side street which is 6 blocks away from the Djemaa el-Fna square. The neighborhood is part of the old city where the people are nice friendly and respectful. We walked back and forth between the hotel and the square palaces and souks with no problem at all.  Back to the hotel itself the staff is friendly and always ready to provide you with even the slightest detail. The bar is very well stocked (unusual in Marrakesh) and the food is very good (although much more expensive than the stalls of the street or squares..). Their breakfast display is fantastic everything was great.  The rooms are very nice excellent air conditioning perfect mattress clean white towels with rose petals on them (a welcome greeting) fantastic shower). Our room was on the second floor with a small terrace and stairs going to the roof of the room where we had another terrace with two recliners (great for sun bathing or star gazing magical )  The swimming pool is fantastic located in the center ofthe gardens.

Les Jardins de la Medina,TAlongbeach wrote a review Aug 2012,50,Beautiful setting in the heart of one crazy place. Spa needs help though,I will get to the point. We loved the hotel.    I would recommend you book this location. I would give it 5 stars except for the spa with I speak about later.    The grounds were very nice cool and comfortable considering the August heat. The staff was very pleasant and responsive. I believe the meals were reasonable but won't know until I get the credit card bill.  You are greeted with fruits and a drink and get to enjoy them under the mist near a fountain. We . did not have room service so cannot comment on that but the staff were quickly responsive if you called the desk Most of the staff understood english but they do seem to have more French and Arabic ( of course) speakers.    Modern room with good WiFi. Could have just a few more english speaking channels on the TV.  .  A few complaints. The pillows were too hard for me. Some may like them.    THE SPA. My wife went for masasage and the staff talked during the entire session and in Arabic. They did not do a good job with the basics of massage. Not even the full body for an hour. THey did not respect their privacy. The management needs to review things with the spa staff and let them know they need to give high quality service and keep the customer as the priority.    We visited another hotel for a cooking class and the interior was amazing but the grounds were just so so.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Mia_Khan wrote a review Aug 2012,50,A truly memorable hotel,We chose this hotel on the basis that it was inside the medina had a pool and had more character than the large hotels in Marrakech. We definitely were not disappointed. On arrival we were welcomed by the manager and took a seat in the gardens of the hotel which were stunning whilst being offered dried fruits a refreshing juice and cold flannels. It was a great first impression. The room was lovely great air con a huge bed rose petals in the bathroom a rain shower/bath and a well stocked mini bar. The maid service was excellent and we loved the weather report & morrocan pastries left in our room every evening. The pool was a good size always enough beds in or out of the shade and every so often free water smoothies and cold flannels. Breakfast was good but we were really pleased with the lunch and dinner we ate here several times during our stay. Really great morrocan/European food in a beautiful atmosphere. The hammam and argan oil massage we had as a couple at the same time very relaxing and good value. No need to go elsewhere for this! The hotel staff were so helpful giving us recommendations for restaurants almost every evening and booking them for us and arranging taxis. The square is a 15 minute walk away or a cheap taxi ride if you don't fancy walking. We would definitely stay again and would recommend this hotel to everyone.

As you drive up to the hotel down the winding dirty streets of the old town medina you may feel a little nervous. But on entry through the door you are met with an oasis of calm. The reception team will make you feel very welcome and show you around the hotel the restraurant the pool the gym (which you won't want to use!) the various sun spots around the hotel the massage parlor etc. Everyhthing is done in style at this hotel we stayed In a solarium room so middle of the road it had ensuite massive bed tv small sheltered balcony and a massive balcony up some stairs with 2 sun loungers! All very smart and well presented.    All in all the service is ok to good depends who you get and how much they understand your English or pigeon French. I recommend using French but as we were learning it out there it was still pretty shaky. The food is excellent. Although stay away from fish generally in marracech is my advice. The hotel is smallmaround 36 rms and there was no more than 50 people staying when we went (aug) lots of rm by the pool and most people keep themselves to themselves you won't want to leave the hotel! When you do leave be mindful of the souks they are great fun just take some patience with you and don't get to pressured into buying things!

It is located through a door in a wall in the hustle of Marrakech and is like escaping to paradise! It is very central in walking distance to all the major sights. Somehow you disappear through the door and cant hear anything from outside! its like a dessert oasis!  The rooms are beautlful clean with large beds great air con and decorated beautifully. Fruit and pastries are provided and there was a private terrace on top of the room with great views over the central swimming pool area.  The staff were really helpful and would recommend and book anything you wanted. The breakfast was good continental style with a reasonable selection. There were other roof terraces around the hotel that anyone could use so make sure you go and explore!  We visited in mid July and it was BOILING! 46 degrees! Apparantly this is the quite time because of the extreme heat. The central square in Marakkech is a real experience! Just make sure you dont pay anymore than 25% of the first price you are told!

It is on the more expensive side for Marrakech accomodation however if you can stretch your budget you won't be disappointed. I've previously lived in Marrakech (for about 7 months) and also made around 13 separate trips since. I've stayed in various hotels and riads to try them out - this one would have to be the best so far. Previously a merchant's palace this place has a large lush garden and an absolutely amazing pool - fantastic after the hustle and bustle of the medina. We stayed in a solarium room with a small private garden and it was a lovely home away from home. We loved the nice little touches mutlicoloured welcoming juice rose petals sprinkled around the bathroom roses or pastries with weather report as part of the turn down service. The only negative was the billing process at the end. The bill wasn't clear for English speaking people and didn't acknowledge our original booking confirmation where we had already paid a deposit. In addition we were charged 10% tax on total bill yet booking confirmation clearly that VAT was included in the final price. Shame as this is the only thing that would stop me from returning to this wonderful oasis.

As soon as you walk through the big wooden door you forget all about the madness and the hustle and bustle that is Marrakech. The hotels gardens are wonderful full of singing birds and the odd tortoise strolling around. Eat at the hotel for a wonderful candlelit dining experience by the pool. Breakfast is also great with lots to choose from and lots of yummy cakes and moroccan pastries. We stayed in a solarium room with its own sun terrace which was great and the room was spotlessly cleaned and complimentary bottled water left everyday. The staff here are very attentive and being a small hotel (a large Riad really) the staff remember you and offer you various complimentary snacks during your stay. We stayed for 3 nights and received smoked salmon cucumber soup spicy lamb sausages nuts and watermelon during our time at the hotel.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Shantiburi wrote a review Jul 2012,50,"A haven of peace, quiet and beauty",Have travelled to Marrakech a number of times and stayed in smart chic riads. This time though due to the July travel dates I needed somewhere with a pool to relax around during the searing 45 degree heat of the afternoon. Les Jardins de la Medina proved to be a really great option.    Based in the Kasbah area it is a great location for getting lost (intentionally) for a good wander around the small streets and lanes to chat to the locals and get a feel for everyday Marrakshi life. Yes it is a 20 minute walk to the souks in the Medina and the Djeema el Fna but if that's too much then taxis are readily available and they all seemed to know where the hotel was.    The Sultana room I had was spectacular. Wrap round terrace with loungers chairs and a day bed overlooking the pool surrounded by tall palms filled with collared doves blackbirds and sparrows - so a lovely dawn chorus. Massive king sized bed dressing room bathroom with rain shower and excellent aircon.    The restaurant is also really good. We ate at two of the main foodie attractions in the city - Al Fassia and Maison Arabe - and both were good and worth a trip but the restaurant at Les Jardin actually topped them both. The lamb tanjia with potatoes was truly memorable as was the chicken and olive tagine. They also serve quite late so after an evening soaking up the madness of the Djeem el Fna they will happily supply a lovely meal after 10 at night if you want. Breakfast on the pool terrace was also a great start to the day - impressive selection of fresh fruit and the best home made yogurt I have tasted in a while.    The staff and service were excellent. After staying five nights with them the staff know you by name are attentive and very friendly. The concierge desk offered very good recommendations on things to do and places to go and could not have been more helpful.    We also had a half day cookery lesson with one of the restaurant chefs up on the roof terrace which was fun informative and resulted in a really good lunch afterwards.    The gardens are full of palms and well tended plants plus a family of tortoises who walk around at will and seem very contented in their beautiful surroundings. It's difficult not to envy them their home!    For a winter trip to Marrakech then perhaps a chic small riad is a very good option. From April through to October then Les Jardins de la Medina would be my choice now so that I could take advantage of the lovely pool and its surrounding gardens. Actually it will probably be my first choice whatever the time of year.,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Chiang Mai, Thailand",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shantiburi

This time we stayed two nights and three nights with a week in between. Situated within the city walls this is an ideal base for exploring Marrakech on foot. Outside everything is hustle and bustle but behind the hotel walls it is peaceful and calm. The food is of a high standard (better than last year I think) and is well presented and served. At times we did have to wait a bit between courses but what the hell we were on holiday and the Chef is very talented. The pool is set in the middle of the courtyard garden and can get crowded. The staff work very hard the building and garden are always clean and tidy. Rooms are comfortable and clean the linen is spotless.

Les Jardins de la Medina,williamson1 wrote a review Jun 2012,50,A Special Place,We stayed at this hotel in May for 3 nights and were delighted with our choice.    The hotel arranged our airport transfers and our tour guide and a driver to take us to the Atlas mountains. They also recommended a restaurant for the night that we didn't dine with them. We were very happy with the service offered and their recommendations.    The hotel is immaculately clean the staff pleasant eager to assist with any queries and very welcoming. The pool garden and restaurant area is fabulous chic comfortable and calming. The food was delicious and imaginative.    We were thrilled with our choice of hotel and after the madness of city it was always heaven to return to. Some travelers have mentioned that the hotel is quite a long way out of the centre but we found it to be a good 10 minute walk only. The peace and quiet there far outweighed a few extra minutes walking we were never disturbed day or night.    Our party of 4 was so happy here and very sorry to leave.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Roxsrgreat wrote a review Jun 2012,50,"Green, cool, fresh, & calm in Marrakech",Like all oases in the desert you see the greenery first‚Ä¶then you feel the shade and the cool! The Jardins de la Medina greenery cascades into the alleyway around the door that opens into a cool calm fresh space where you are greeted with Moroccan mint tea. Above you towering palms amid tropical plants around the pool and restaurant. Flowering mimosa and bougainvillea full of the chatter of birds surround the paths to your room. Tables and rest areas are tucked away in the garden above a roof terrace ideal for early morning or late evening relaxation. Moroccan-French cuisine endless breakfasts lunch at the pool's edge no noise no hustle no bustle no haggling. Cheerful fun helpful welcoming staff a true Moroccan experience.

Les Jardins de la Medina,GEGLondon wrote a review May 2012,50,Absolute heaven on earth!,We first visited Les Jardins de la Medina for the day at the end our trip as the temperature had soared to over 40 and our riad pool was quite small and in use. As soon as we walked through the doors and out to the courtyard we knew we were somewhere special. The day deal is very good or certainly was for us - 350 dirhams including a 3 course lunch. The pool area and gardens are absolutely beautiful and we enjoyed the restaurant as well. The staff cannot do enough for you and from the moment we arrived we didn't want to leave. So much so that we ended up checking in for our final night and after sleeping in the king sized bed and waking up to the sound of the birds changed our flights so we could stay another day!    The location is great for the Kasbah area the palace and the tombs but a taxi ride away from the centre and some of the other sights. However having spent 5 days exploring Marrakech on foot Les Jardins de La Medina suited us perfectly. We stayed in a superior room in the main riad (I think it was 134) which also had an outside balcony. It was huge with a small seating area and fire place with rose petals scattered in the bathroom. The second night we were moved to a solarium room which on the other side of the riad and smaller but had both a balcony and a sun terrace ‚Äì a perfect place to see the stars at night. My only disappointment was with the hammam which was quite expensive and felt very rushed and not that pleasurable. However I saw lots of other people going for treatments so it could be a one off.    All in all Les Jardins was a wonderful tranquil oasis and we would return in a heartbeat.,Date of stay: May 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GEGLondon
Les Jardins de la Medina,worldy10 wrote a review May 2012,50,Magic,Location in the southern part of the Medina & inside the Kasbah is perfectly safe for any tourist. Gorgeous hotel huge garden big pool rooms are big (with AC and extremely clean bathrooms perfect) and most have a little terrace some a private sunroof. Staff is more than kind service incredible. Breakfast's included served in-or outside.  Ideal for a long weekend or a week holiday if you want total peace.  Lunch there is nice as well. Menu and dishes are ok not overwhelming.  Go out for dinner and try El Fassia or Fendouk both incredible - even locals go which isn't the case @ other places (too expensive or not good).  The Spa on top floor is one of the best I've ever been to. The massages and facials are 5 star xxl.

We found the staff cheerful and very helpful. The pool and gradens were lovely and a pleasure to sit in. The room (I think it was number 128) was large with a sitting room but our floor was the kitchen ceiling which meant you didn't get a lie in much after 6am.They sure could clang those pots in the morning! It was the first room on the left with two circular windows on 1st floor which you could see looking from the restaurant. We decided to embrace the early morning call and were always first for breakfast giving us a great choice of the excellent fare offered. We really enjoyed the service here and had a few mornings lie in at the next place on our tour.,Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/borjeno

Les Jardins de la Medina,Elisabeth W wrote a review May 2012,50,Fantastic hotel,Arrived home yesterday from this wonderful hotel in Marrakech. Cannot recommend it highly enough - staff were extremely well trained: polite helpful and a pleasure to deal with; the accommodation was wonderful (we upgraded) and was kept spotlessly clean; the food was outstanding and included the best hotel breakfast we've ever had (and we have travelled a lot - the French influence was clear!); the setting was magical in an otherwise noisy and dirty city; and there were facilities for treatments and exercise if you like that sort of thing. Only slight downside was the lack of space around the pool but if you want privacy the beautiful garden has this and there are places to sit amongst the trees. Beware if you don't like birds as they are everywhere even inside the restaurant... Very highly recommended hotel - but don't miss the spectacular city or the Atlas Mountains either!,Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElisabethW615

The service was impeccable. After walking all day thru the beautiful mosaics in the palaces and tombs haggling in the souks and dodging cars and motorcycles the lovely pool and gardens are most relaxing.

We had a room with a roof terrace and sun loungers which was really nice and private away from the main (albeit very nice and really relaxing) pool of the hotel.    Throughout the stay we were impressed by small touches such as complimentary nibbles in our room rose petals all over the bathroom and it was immaculately clean and new-looking.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Randolph314 wrote a review Mar 2012,50,An Oasis,We stayed at Les Jardins for 3 nights and had an excellent experience. Like most hotels in Marrakech it doesn't look like much from the outside but Les Jardins is magnificent once you step inside. The hotel is built around a large interior courtyard consisting of a large pool a restaurant with patio seating and a garden. The rooms are spacious and extraordinarily well-appointed the food was terrific and the staff was friendly and helpful.    The main thing you notice about Les Jardins is how open it is. The other riads we saw in the medina tended to be very dark and claustrophobic. Les Jardins is the opposite. Being a tourist in Marrakech wears you out during the day - it's hot confusing people are constantly trying to hustle you for money and you get lost every five minutes. It was great to have somewhere so relaxing to come home to. We wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.,Date of stay: September 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"San Francisco, CA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Randolph314

Les Jardins de la Medina,Don B wrote a review Mar 2012,50,"Restful experience, special place",Les Jardines provides a haven away from the general chaos of the Marrakech medina. The gardens are delightful and the swimming pool heated. Scattered throughout the hotel and gardens are bijou seating areas so even after staying for 3 days there was not sufficient time to discover all the quiet semi secluded spots.  Our room was delightful; large well proportioned with a separate seating area and small balcony overlooking the gardens. We were over the hamman downstairs which perhaps explains why there seemed to be under-floor heating?  Our double bed was large comfortable and had a mountains of pillows (a must for me) while the bathroom was small but stylish.  Room maid service in particular was very good coming at least twice a day and departing leaving a shower of rose petals.  We were particularly impressed with the early morning tea service which was quick and free. This is so much appreciated when hotels often charge an silly amount for this core service (the Cirankan Palace in Istanbul once charged us US$23 for two tea bags and hot water ~ I still have the bill).  The breakfast buffet is good quality and is served overlooking the gardens we also enjoyed the popular restaurant for dinner (reviewed elsewhere). Good food at a reasonable price.  The big downside of Les Jardines is the location which is in the extreme SW of the Medina. While close to the palaces and the royal tombs it is still a hike and the main attractions of Marrakech are definitely a taxi ride away unless you like walking and that is not practical in the warmer weather. The narrow streets mean that vehicle access can be slow at times.

Les Jardins de la Medina,preciouspixies wrote a review Mar 2012,50,Wonderful lunch in a superb surrounding!,We came for lunch at Les Jardins de la Medina whilst in Marrakech. A colleague had stayed at the hotel and had highly recommended the establishment. We sat outside by the poor area which is just gorgeous and so peaceful! The menu is french but the waitress translated everything on the menu for us which was very handy as I'm pretty clueless with French. The food was fantastic (I had the tagine de poulet aux oignons et amandes sucrees which was just delicious!!!); the service was fantastic the staff were very attentive and even from just having lunch we were pretty jealous that we weren't hotel guests too. It was such a gorgeous place in a quiet street (which is very uncommon in Marrakech) but just five minutes from the Tombs.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Skaanetraveller wrote a review Mar 2012,50,Very good hotel - excellent service,This was our first trip to Marrakesh and the hotel Jardins de la Medina is a good reason to come back. It may not be the absolutely 'authentic' environment some people may be looking for but it is indeed a high quality hotel with excellent service and the ambience is genuine enough for a first-time visitor. People that are rating this hotel lower than excellent are of course entitled to do so but it may be that it is a rating against expectations rather than a objective assessment of the hotels qualities (I experience this quite frequently when reading reviews in Tripadvisor by the way).    Good sized heated pool (the heating certainly not needed in summer but very much so in February) good breakfast and dinner. A nice touch was the Manager's apero which was provided free of charge as a social event one evening (appeared to be a regular thing).,Date of stay: February 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Basel, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skaanetraveller

We arrive to sunshine and a friendly driver awaits to take us to the hotel. First impressions don't disappoint. Staff are exceptionally helpful and friendly. We are whisked away by Youssef to enjoy mint tea to a court yard situated by a fountain surrounded by orange trees. After explaining where everything is in the hotel he then goes on to tell us what are the best places to see in Marrakech.  A back scrub and hammam follows in the Spa - bliss after our travelling ! The Spa is completely amazing high ceilings and fabulous features that wouldn't be out of place in a high end spot in Central London.    The hotel suite is also luxurious with lots of extra little touches thrown in. I was very pleasantly surprised.

Les Jardins de la Medina,JayMcNamara wrote a review Feb 2012,50,Heavenly Escape,We stayed at the Les Jardins last June in 100 degree heat and we were so delighted that we had chosen this hotel! As soon as you walk through the wooden door you are welcomed by a cool and contemporary reception. You are taken through to the hotel's restaurant and out into the garden's which are a true paradise in the middle of a crazy bustling city!  The plants and flora are beautiful and there are lots of birds chirping away. You can't hear any noises from outside the hotel it truly is peaceful and relaxing. The pool is lovely and although not that big perfect for dunking in and having a few short strokes. The sunbeads are of top quality and the hotel itself is stunning beautiful architecture and lots of nooks and crannies to explore!  The restaurant serves lovely breakfast and our room was beautiful. Big with large french doors that we could open out onto our own little terrace overlooking the pool heaven! The bed was so comfortable and the shower / bath was of top quality also.  I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this hotel whatsoever. It is now my ambition to try and return as soon as i can.  I am a parent but wouldn't really take my child here only because there isn't much to do for them here (or in this city really!) and its so peaceful as it is i wouldn't want my child to annoy any of the other guests relaxing and soaking up the atmosphere!

Overall though the staff make it Yossif on reception was just so helpful friendly and kind the bar and restaurant staff really go out of there way to make you feel at home it has the feel of a welcoming country house hotel rather than a Marrakesh riad style hotel! We did visit the spa the Hamman scrub is done in the hotel next door which has the most amazing basement hamman they pretty much switch on the steam for you. The surrounds are just stunning and well worth getting on arrival as we did. Its only 30 mins and really kicks off your holiday. We had other treatments in the Hotel Spa which are more like treatment rooms than a full spa experience but it has to be said the facial and massage we had were pretty top notch.    Overall I would definately stay in this property again and recommend it the only possible negative I can think of is that it is about a 10 minute walk from the main square but its a nice walk and who can ever walk back after all that shopping!,Date of stay: February 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Sunningdale, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoozeL

Les Jardins de la Medina,John G wrote a review Jan 2012,50,"Friendly, good quality sanctuary of a hotel",Quite a surprise to arrive at a five star hotel where one is confronted with a brick wall and just a small entry door into what ultimately proved to be the haven beyond! Check in was a relaxing affair with the formalities done whilst sampling local mint tea.The grounds of the hotel are very private with a lovely Islamic style garden which must be a super cool place to be in the heat of a summer's day. January temperatures still reached 25 degrees C in the afternoon so sitting out was a passable thing to do!. We paid the upgrade for a Solarium room which was well worth it. The private roof terrace was a great way to enjoy the afternoon sun after a few hours of exploring the at times very hectic city. Certainly recommend asking the hotel to arrange a taxi to bring you from the airport. This was good value and saved the worry the taxi driver might not find the hotel. We also booked an interesting trip through the hotel to be driven up into the Atlas mountains one day with our own private driver. The food in the hotel restaurant offered good choices and was tasty albeit not that cheap. The breakfasts were wonderful with a variety of choice often lacking in European hotel breakfasts.

I am lucky enough not to have to pay for my accommodation and usually stay in pretty nice places. The trip to Morocco for a change was for pleasure rather than business.    And (clich√© ahead) what a pleasure it was. The hotel is truly lovely - a little oasis of calm amongst the madness of the Medina.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Where_2_Stay_M wrote a review Jan 2012,40,Beautiful - but I wouldn't stay here again,we stayed at the les jardins for 4 nights - followed by a 2 night stay in a different riad    Don't get me wrong this hotel is a beautiful lovely oasis (see pics) as stated in all the other reviews - so I shall not repeat what everyone else has said    However I will add you get what you pay for - and this hotel is only a beautiful lovely oasis as the prices are EXPENSIVE    I was disappointed with:  1. the breakfast .. it was limited in the sense that there was no chef to prepare food on the spot and most food was very sweet - there were a lot of cakes dates and other sweets. Dinner/Lunch were also limited in choices and prices were expensive verging on ridiculous for Marrakech standards.. this was probably why the restaurant was empty every night.    2.prices of excursions - the hotel were charging OVER ¬£100 (GBP) for a trip to the cascades which we later booked with a private tour company with a brand new air conditioned Mercedes van for ¬£30. The hotel has the attitude that only the rich stay there - so they will charge rich prices. Possibly this is the case but for us we had saved a long time to stay there so were a bit let down.    3. there was a MASSIVE cockroach in our very beautiful room. - we called reception who sent someone from housekeeping to dispose of it - but I think for hotel of that calibre there shouldn't have been a cockroach in the first place. This also ruined my sleep that night.    4. on our last day the taxi driver outside the hotel took us to our next riad. He dropped us to the top of an alley we paid him and he told us it was just on the right (cars can't go down that road).. it was a 10 minute walk in the opposite direction and on the left!! dragging our suitcases in the heat was not pleasant. I know this is not the hotels fault - but a lot of the taxi drivers outside the hotel had the same attitude - that if you stay at les jardines you are mega rich so we will rip you off.. on top of ripping of tourists anyway    5. contrary to some of the other reviews the hotel is a 20 minute walk to the square - we timed it  6. when we arrived at the hotel and were waiting to check in we were handed an envelope - and told by the staff - if we would like to tip any of the staff to put the money in the envelope - we hadn't even checked in!!    Overall the hotel itself is beautiful but these few little points are just some reasons why I wouldn't stay here again. I think you can get an equally excellent service for half the price elsewhere.... and the pool was cold even though it says it was heated!,Date of stay: December 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Where_2_Stay_M

Les Jardins de la Medina,Rosie S wrote a review Jan 2012,40,"A haven of tranquillity, greenery, sunny nooks and Moroccan beauty.",I found Les Jardins de la Medina a very mixed bag. It is a superb property excellently maintained and always exceedingly clean. Breakfast was always fresh and well prepared and with a great variety. We stayed at the hotel in December 2011 for 7 nights. Our highlights can be seen from the photos we really appreciated the roof garden and the fact that the pool was heated and covered at night which meant it was useable even in December. I had a morning cookery school which I thoroughly enjoyed.  We had a couple of problems one of which at the very end of our stay was nothing to do with the hotel or Riad itself and the staff there went overboard to help us out thank you. The other problem was a kind of ‚Äòequipment failure‚Äô all I can say is if you are going to use the Hamman check they now have marble beds and not wooden ones.  I learned whilst in Morocco (we were there for 4 weeks and we have another revue for the Atlas Hotel in Essaouira) two things - if you say something is ‚Äòokay‚Äô and you are actually making a British understatement your okay will be taken at face value so if you have a problem say so and it will be dealt with. I also learned Moroccans are very adept at making decisions on your behalf (most of these are on the street) or on behalf of their employer so your problem may not be passed on unless you make it very clear that the problem should be. It seems to me there is no ‚Äòday book‚Äô in Moroccan hotels as in good UK hotels in which incidents; queries are recorded and discussed or passed on. So don‚Äôt expect people to know or be mind readers.  We found both here and in Essaouira the 7.30 pm time for dinner too late for us although at Les Jardins you can eat a decent and healthy meal up until 6 pm and if you get eh chance to try their rose flavoured ice cream do!  As mentioned by others the Souks or the main square are a good 20 minute from the hotel and this can be a hostile 20 minute walk I would recommend you use the services of a Moroccan guide for many reasons. Or simply stay inside in this haven of tranquillity greenery sunny nooks and Moroccan beauty.,Date of stay: December 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Okcular, T√ºrkiye",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RosieO060

If you just want to chill out in the beautifully peaceful enclosed garden or by the pool this is the place. The buzzing old town part of Marrakech is right outside the front door but you wouldn't know it.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Matissefan wrote a review Dec 2011,50,A wonderful stay in Marrakech,We have visited Marrakech many times with and without our young children and we have stayed in a number of different hotels and riads. The Jardins de la Medina is definitely one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in.  The buildings are typically and attractively Moroccan in style but very well thought-through for Western needs and those of small children (the room came with a baby bath bottle warmer travel cot and lots more) the gardens are beautiful (and house a family of tortoises) and the pool is perfect. We stayed during August and outside it was extremely hot but the rooms have good air conditioning and the terrace and restaurant had a clever water sprinkler system to cool people down.  The hotel is very family-friendly (as well as all the baby facilities in the room every evening they cooked the pasta that we brought for our toddler to eat) and the staff were all really helpful. There was a mix of families and couples and everyone seemed to be having an equally wonderful holiday.  We arrived during Ramadan (though we didn't realise beforehand) but we were able to get food and drinks as we wanted. The quality of the food was excellent - we enjoyed breakfasts and dinners on the terrace and lunches at the pool and were often tempted not to even leave the hotel despite all the fab food places Marrakech has to offer!  The hotel is located in the kasbah area of the city away from the wonderful madness of the main square but close enough to walk to. It is also easy for a taxi to get to unlike some Marrakech hotels.  We will undoubtedly stay at the Jardins de la Medina the next time we visit Marrakech - it offers such a perfect mix of riad and hotel - and would highly recommend it to any couple or family visiting Marrakech.,Date of stay: August 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Matissefan
Les Jardins de la Medina,HotelReviewer48 wrote a review Nov 2011,40,Oasis,The hotels is a beautiful Oasis in a hectic city. Once you're inside the walls you don't notice any of the noise and it's easy to relax by the pool. And thank goodness for the pool - we (rather stupidly) went in June/July - and it was stupidly hot - the only thing stopping us from hiding in our air conditioned rooms was the lovely pool and gardens.  We has lunch at the hotel once which was superb but didn't stay for an evening meal (far too many other places to explore).    It is quite far to the 'square' from here - easy to walk - but by the 3rd day of this daily routine it got a bit tedious. Unfortunately most attractions are the other side of the square. But it's the sacrifice you pay for a pool quietness and open space.    Only annoyance was the fact the hotel charged through the roof for bottled water (around ¬£4 for a 500ml bottle!). So we bought water on a daily basis from a tiny shop right outside and save around ¬£100 in a week compared to if we'd bought it in the hotel. They did tell us off on a number of occasions - but we ignored them. In 45 degree heat you need water and plenty of it - we were buying 5 litres at a time - so there is no way I was going to the bar to buy a 500ml bottle every time I needed a drink. So buy you water outside and ignore them if they try and tell you off - they're not going to chuck you out over it!,Date of stay: June 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Cardiff,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HotelReviewer48
Les Jardins de la Medina,kamagogo wrote a review Nov 2011,50,Perfect........,Fabulous. Weather was not good but always a log fire burning in the salon. For us the location was perfect as although it was a 15 minute walk to the square we loved walking past the locals and chatting to them when we could. Our room looked out on to a quiet alley and it was great standing in the bath with our head sticking out of the little window watching a couple of local election marches with shouting and cheering. Breakfast was great - probably one of the best we've enjoyed in a hotel. Not ridiculous wastage but a great variation - hot/cold sweet/savoury eggs to order and warm pancakes and other local goodies cooked on the spot. Pool looked fabulous but due to weather we didn't try it out.  Staff couldn't do more to help us and their friendliness was genuine. Good pick-up from the airport and he was there waiting for us even though our flight was delayed 1hr.  We left Marrakech for the beach for a week and returned for one night for our flight the next day. We decided to sample another similar priced riad for that night. We were glad to have the comparison and decided Les Jardin wins - absolutely no contest. If we visit Marrakech again we will definintely stay here.

We had dinner and lunch in the restaurant and both were very good. Very nice atmosphere in the bar with the fireplace.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Allan M wrote a review Nov 2011,50,"If you want the Kasbah, this is it!","This amazing property tucked away in the middle of the Kasbah in Marrakech is a hidden gem.  The front door belies the beautiful Hotel/Riad that lies behind it. The garden full of oranges and the associated aromas of that intertwined with the smell of fresh coffee and pastries made this one a winner for me. Yes I did see the owner and his very well behaved little dog and they played very period FRENCH music that gave the eating area a very Piaf mood. The Imam calling the faithful to prayer from the nearby mosque made me realise that I wasn't there for mushy peas and chips and that I was in the middle of the Kasbah. Everybody that was with me were absolutely envious even though they were stay at one of the more ""upmarket"" Hotels in the newer part of Marrakech! I loved the location and the breakfast were fresh and tasty and very well presented by awesome staff who could not do enough to help. Concierge and Reception were helpful and just plain good people. It is a 15 minute walk through some of the most amazing streets to the main square. I was personally very happy and the rose petals did not worry me in anyway.

We very much enjoyed the hotel surroundings and staff our accommodation and the food was great. I would say luxury without an outrageous price. Any request for booking a trip to trek up Ourika Valley or take a transfer to Casablanca was organised and a fair cost. The pool was lovely though the weather wasn't particularly. I have stayed at other 4 star hotels in Morocco and am shocked that this hotel is rated 4 star as it far better than any such rated hotel I have stayed at here.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Serial_Traveller wrote a review Nov 2011,20,Mystified in Marrakech,In order to understand this review you have to acknowledge that I have been to Marrakech many times and have experienced many different styles of riads and hotels. By chance i came across this hotel featured on google and after doing some research and reading all the positive reviews I couldn't figure out why I had  not heard of it or knew anyone who had stayed there. With that in mind you can you only appreciate  my opinion. So.....    I return to Marrakech again and again as I am still fascinated to keep finding the most enchanting riads which have been decorated by such creative people people whom have often come from the art and fashion world and have taken the opportunity to create something unique in these wonderful buildings. Often one goes looking for hidden areas secretly holding interesting art or sculpture an incredible array of bedrooms and lounges or hidden nooks to hide yourself away in and ultimately make you feel very far from home. But the Les Jardins de la Medina totally lacks any such creativity or wow-factor and I really cannot fathom why anyone would think it does. I accept that if you have never been to Marrakech before and know no better you make think the Les Jardins enchanting just because it has a walled garden however there is so much better  to be had elsewhere.    What I also find incredibly strange and suspect is that there is a hotel guide at the hotel called the Chateaux & Hotels Collection (I have also come across this guide in France) and the ONLY hotel/riad it recommends in the whole of Marrakech is the Les Jardins de la Medina and this frankly is ridiculous and misleading and makes me strongly question how much research the producers of this guide have put into investigating the wonderful  hotels and riads Marrakech has to offer or if hotel owner actually paid to be featured in it.    You also need to know and should not be fooled in any way into believing this is a riad it is not. Part of its origins may have been a riad but now it is a purpose built hotel and I very much suspect a hotel that is promoted on package holiday websites for a low-to-middle range price bracket. I have certainly not come across this establishment on any websites I use in fact when I came across it advertised and then looked up various websites to see the outstanding reviews it had been given I was rather baffled as to why I had not heard of it before especially as I have been to Marrakech so many times. But now having stayed at this hotel I now realise why this very average 3 star rated at best hotel does not get featured on the websites I prefer to use when researching properties. It simply isn't good enough.    I presume the owner lives on the premises. I did constantly notice a rather weather beaten Frenchman  grabbing bits of food off the buffet set-up and his rectum-bearing dog trailing behind him. i dont think this is acceptable especially when people are eating their breakfast.    Further do you want to stay at a hotel which from early morning until midnight plays a monotonous selection of British and American pop music warbling French torch songs and any other 'grab a selection of musical tat' from around the world? Personally I would have thought most people go to Marrakech to drink in the  culture relax in the warmth and enjoy this still slightly mediaeval way of life. Does anyone truly come to Marrakech and want to be woken by hearing Barry Manilow at 8.30 in the morning? Further did anyone in the world have a desire to go to Marrakech and hope to listen to The Carpenters singing Jambalaya while  they are having breakfast? I doubt it! All this middle of the road music being played everywhere made me feel like I was staying at a 1970's wet-weekend holiday camp.    I booked the best room available. Though it wasn't important to me it should be noted  there was no bath only a shower. So if you do want a bathtub then ask in advance.    I know some people like it but I find rose petals scattered over the bed and over towels in the bathroom  really tacky and so-1970's ... and I cannot stand towels being twisted into stupid shapes or displayed on beds.  This is supposed to be Marrakech not a holiday camp in Thailand.    The good points. Certainly the restaurant serves very good food in the evenings the standard  is high but again you're subjected to a crass selection of music which kills off any hope of creating a pleasant atmosphere. The breakfast buffet is mediocre. Our room was pleasant enough (apart from the silly towel shapes and rose petals) and we had a good large terrace but ultimately it was just white-washed and simply does not compare to many of the amazing rooms I have rented in Marrakech in the past. Le Jardins - as you would expect - does at least have a rather nice garden area to relax in though that again is spoilt by the music speakers dotted around which drown out the peace the birds the water fountains. And there is certainly a good sized pool which various families happily let their children scream and dive-bomb into without any consideration for others.    I accept this is a perfectly adequate establishment for those on a budget and for families who want to let their children run riot. But it most certainly wasn't for me or for the type of people I know - and it most certainly wasn't the Marrakech that I love and remain enchanted by.,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Serial_Traveller

Behind the big door in the dusty street lies an amazing hotel.  We had a superior room which was gorgeous and loads of space.    It's 20min walk to the central square and a few local shops round the corner.    The pool was slightly disappointing as most the beds are in shadow alot of the time (oct)  but you can head to the roof loungers for sun    Overall great place friendly staff nice place to relax    Hints & Tips  1) you must have receipts for any currency changed if u want to change it back at the airport you will have to ask for these  2) we arranged for a guide via the hotel don't! Ours  took us to his mates shop out of the way which we have to pay for the taxi  3) when you first get the main sq look up go relax in one of the roof top bars to acclimatise  4) Watch the taxis they'll try and rip you off 9 times out of 10 the hotel will give u prices  5) smart phones with Gps are a real help get the maps by wifi then head off into the souks.. Even with data turned off  6) you can to agadir we did private tour bus for ¬£100   7) there is very little to do in Agadir..

Nothing was to much trouble. As we were driving through the Medina it was like stepping back in time so much so that my partner and I began wondering what we had let ourselves in for as the roads were more like back alleys with hundreds of people thronging the streets.    Our taxi pulled up at the Riad and the first thing we noticed was a very nondescript wooden door However as we opened it it was like being transported into another world. We arrived at the hotel at about 10am so our rooms were not yet ready. We were greeted by the manager who told us they would be ready by 12 noon and asked if we would like some very delicious mint tea. We were shown into the gardens and it was beautiful and sat there drinking our tea and really feeling very relaxed. We were then gven a tour of the Riad by the manager after which we where shown to our delightful room which was on the ground floor with our own litlte patio area with table and chairs. This stepped into the beautiful gardens which are so well looked after. Every day when the rooms were made up the staff sprinkled rose petals over the bed and in the bathroom. We had lunch every day in the outside section of the restaurant overlooking the pool. The food is delicious with the same menu daily but with added ""specials of the day"".

Les Jardins de la Medina,TripAdvi5er_User wrote a review Sep 2011,50,Chill out in style,"As many other travelers have commented I was slightly worried when our taxi pulled up in what appeared to be a dead end street and announced that we had arrived at the Jardins De La Medina. As with much of Marrakech the building's exterior gives few clues as to what lies beyond but we needn't have worried. The interior of the Riad is stunning and a welcome relief from the hussle and bussle that is Marrakech. Everything about the hotel has an air of peace and calm that I have never felt in any other hotel I have ever stayed in. You are made to feel very welcome right from the very first moment you step foot inside and are served your first traditional Moroccan mint tea.    We stayed in a mid-range 'Superior' room which consisted of private bathroom with shower/bath combo separate lounge area huge (and very comfortable) king sized bed aircon/ceiling fan minibar fridge (useful for storing your own 'contraband' drinks) robes and slippers in room mini safe (free to use) flat screen TV with DVD player and private outdoor patio area with table and chairs. The room itself was well decorated with a nice balance between modern contemporary furnishings and a traditional Moroccan feel. Not that we watched it much but the only TV channel in English was BBC World News so you may want to make use of the free DVD rental service from reception (or for the techies out there you may want to take your own movies as the DVD player has a DivX compatible USB port). Another tip is that if you are trying desperately to save on luggage weight (thank you Ryanair!) then I'm reliably informed that unlike some the in-room hairdryer is more than suitable for the job.    During our 7 day stay at the end of Aug we encountered only a handful of other guests around the hotel (nationalities ranged from French UK German and American). This was perhaps due to the timing of the Ramadan religious festival which ended a few days into our stay. While the local Muslims observe the traditional Ramadan fasting ritual this was barely noticeable once inside the hotel itself with food and drink being available to guests all day as normal. The hotel restaurant serves a mixture of Moroccan and International dishes for both lunch and evening meals. Every meal we had was delicious and the waiter service was excellent. My only negative would be that as with most restaurants in Marrakech prices were much higher for food and drink than expected (we averaged about ¬£40-¬£50 a night for 2 courses and alcoholic drinks for 2 people with mains ¬£15-¬£20 and beer/wine ¬£4-¬£5 a glass).    Having been suitably fed and watered your next priority is to choose from the many different parts of the hotel on offer for you to relax in. The hotel has a roof terrace with tables/chairs single and double loungers and a partially shaded area with arabian-esque floor cushions and sofa (great place to hide from the mid day sun and read one of the many books donated by other guests from the small library in the bar). Also on the roof is a small gym the cookery school and a completely shaded patio area overlooking the bar and pool area. The pool itself is a great place to spend the day with ample loungers both in and out of the sun. Complimentary towels are provided which the staff are very quick to replace on vacated beds once other guests have moved on. There are also the beautiful gardens from which the hotel draws its name. As well as being home to some of the more permanent guests (namely a family of tortoises) hidden in the trees and pathways which criss-cross the garden courtyard are additional secluded beds loungers and tables should you feel like some privacy away from the pool. The hotel also offers a spa with various relaxation and massage treatments. This was perhaps one of the more disappointing elements of our stay with my girlfriend being left slightly underwhelmed with a Hammam and Henna wrap treatment which basically involved a very quick wash from one of the spa attendants and then 20 minutes alone in the steam room. You may wish to venture further afield to one of the dedicated spa's dotted around town if you are looking for a better value and a more indulgent treatment.    Last but not least the staff at the hotel are also worthy of great praise. Forever attentive without being overbearing they really made you feel at home and always welcomed you with a smile. The team on reception were always very approachable and happy to provide local information and phone for taxi's or recommend and/or make restaurant reservations whenever requested. The restaurant bar and maid staff were also excellent and constantly surprised us be it with little cakes each evening delivered to the room with the next days weather report or cold face towels and complimentary fruit kebabs served around the pool each day (it's the little things like that which really do make your stay).    My only other comment on the hotel is that its location in the most southern district of the Old Town may be a bit far out of the way for some. A walk to the main square (next to the Koutoubia mosque) will take a good 25 mins and may be a bit intimidating for some due to the confusing narrow streets and cars/bikes/horses/mopeds which fight for space with the pedestrian foot traffic. The alternative is of course a ¬£3-¬£4 (or cheaper depending on your haggling skills) taxi ride each way. One last tip is that you may want to try and arrange an each way airport transfer either privately or direct with the hotel as we were ripped off to the tune of 300Dh for the 10 minute ""big"" taxi ride to the hotel which we organised ourselves and only paid 135Dh for the return journey which was organised by the hotel (TIP : big taxi = mercedes = expensive small taxi = hatchback = cheap).    Overall I would highly recommend the Jardins De La Medina. It really is a great place to chill out and is ideally suited to couples looking to relax with a local 'Casablanca' beer after a hard day haggling in the Medina.",Date of stay: August 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Monifieth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TripAdvi5er_User
Les Jardins de la Medina,551613Gerald54 wrote a review Sep 2011,50,A hidden Oasis,"I have rarely enjoyed a stay at any hotel more. The setting was unusual in that from the street it gives very little hint of the exceptional hotel behind the entry door. The gardens within were like a small oasis with delightful small private areas to sit and enjoy the calm atmosphere. The meals were such that we chose to eat most of our meals at the hotel and the service was excellent . The accommodation was also very good and had free wireless internet within the hotel grounds. Fresh fruits were in our room on arrival. I liked the loose rose petals strewn around and the small cake bouchees left after the evening turn down.  We felt quite safe when out walking but were accosted a few times by ""friends"" who wished to show us shopping etc. But most were polite and left you alone if asked to.

Les Jardins de la Medina,H R wrote a review Sep 2011,50,"Welcoming, friendly, attentive staff; very good facilities cuisine and great location",This is the second time we have stayed at the Jardins de la Medina and loved it. As soon as we arrived we were made to feel very welcomed. Our room (Described in their brochure as ‚ÄúSuperior‚Äù) was comfortable air-conditioned had a seating area and a French door that opened onto a small patio.    Everyone was always very helpful and friendly and spoke French and English. Without exception whether they were looking after us at reception porters housekeepers or waiters they were always friendly attentive and informative. We often spoke with Youssef Hakim and Amin who were exemplars of excellent service in reception but it would be unfair to single out anyone more than another.    Food was always excellent with a very good choice of fare for the outdoor buffet breakfast and a delicious evening menu that was well prepared and presented. It‚Äôs a good place to chill out in the heat of the day with a pool forming the central feature of the Riad. Plants and trees provide ample shade and there is a spacious sun deck on the roof for sun worshipers.    The Jardins de la Medina is very well located and although the narrow streets of the Kasbah and Medina are fascinating in themselves you will want to venture further into the city. The Riad is within easy and safe walking distance of the main attractions of Marrakesh e.g. 10 minutes to the Saadian Tombs; 15 minutes to the Badi Palace; 25 minutes at a steady pace to the Koutoubia Mosque the famous Jemaa El Fna and the adjoining souks. The Majorelle Gardens are best reached by Petit Taxi and you‚Äôll find no shortage of them just about everywhere but agree the price before setting off e.g. a one way journey to The Majorelle Gardens will set you back about 40 Dirhams (approx. ¬£3.20).    The Jardins de la Medina enabled us to take on Marrakesh at its own crazy pace and when we‚Äôd had enough we could just walk through the big door of the riad and relax within its cool calm interior. I‚Äôm confident that this riad will always be our choice when staying in Marrakesh Insha‚ÄôAlah.,Date of stay: September 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Ledbury, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Huw-and-Sue

Les Jardins de la Medina,LondonHoli wrote a review Aug 2011,50,WONDERFUL,This was our first visit to Morocco and in July not the best time to go as it is very hot 45 degrees and above and were staying in Marrekech for 4 days. As we walked through the doorway of the Riad 'hole in the wall' from the busy hussle and bustle of the Kasbah we entered a world of tranquility relaxation and a caring staff. This hotel has a wonderful warm friendly feel. Our room was lovely (see pictures) and spotlessly clean. Being what is called 'the low season' and only I think 35 rooms it was nice to meet other guests around the pool and disguss where each of us had been that day. The pool was lovely and so were the cool pretty little hideaway gardens. All the food was very good but one small criticism would be breakfast time where each morning we were invaded by 'bees' swarming around the food and fruit juice containers . Because of this my daughter and I decided to have room service in the lovely small courtyard outside our room which was very nice and at no extra cost. The staff couldn't do enough for their guests and always with a lovely genuine smile. You could borrow videos from reception free of charge which was a great help if you didn't speak French as the only TV station in English in Morocco appears to be BBC World News. We visited a few good restaurants for evening meals which had been recommended to us before we left Britain and would be pleased to pass on any tips etc. As we were two ladies on our own the person on reception would order a taxi to pick us up and take us to wherever we wanted and the driver would arrange to pick us up at whatever time we said. We always felt very safe. We also arranged a day trip to the Atlas Mountains and to have lunch at Richard Bransons Retreat. My daughter and I have travelled to many countries around the world in first class hotels and can honestly say Le Jardin de la Medina can be classed as definately 5*. We would highly recommend this Riad and its staff and hope that we will be able to visit again one day.,Date of stay: July 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LondonHoli

When the taxi first pulled up in front of the Riad I thought to myself Oh No!! We stepped out the cab to push the big wooden front door of the hotel and just couldn't believe what was on the other side. The contrast was amazing. It was as if we had stepped into a different world. I'll leave it at that and let you discover it.  We reserved two superior rooms and according to our reservation the rooms would have private terraces. That wasn't the case. Most of the terraces were a shared courtyard. Nevertheless the rooms were very nice. Our friends kept their assigned room but we upgraded to the solarium room and the hotel staff apologized and were very accomodating (we paid for the upgrade). Loved our room with a small terrace and a private solarium above it . What a pity we didn't get to enjoy it. The weather was cool and rainy at times. Our room had a fireplace and lots of attention to details was given.  The room came with a complimentary buffet. It was a very nice spread of local flavors plus the standard fare. Most of the food was on the sweet side so I ordered omelets and fried eggs and they obliged.  The front desk recommended restaurants and tour guides. The recommendations were excellent.  I highly recommend ""Les Jardins de la Medina"". The hotel was wonderful and the staff amazing. Thank you all for making our stay in Marrakech so memorable. c'etait fantastique!!!

Les Jardins de la Medina,flawlessmary wrote a review Aug 2011,50,exquisite luxury and super romantic atmosphere,My boyfriend surprised me with a reservation in this luxury riad that features lush gardens in the inner patio and an amazing swimming pool. We stayed in one of the suites on the ground floor and from our room we could directly access the gardens and pool. The atmosphere is very classy yet warm and truly relaxing and the service is very good in the best Moroccan hospitality stile. Our room was very spacious with a annexed sitting room. The bathroom was decorated with rose petals and flowers and equipped with some very nice amenities. Complimentary fruit basket and large bottle of water is also offered by the hotel upon arrival. More red roses were deposited on our bed to wish us good night and inform about the next day's weather forecast on a little card. The bed in our room was huge with lovely bed linen and cushions and we slept wonderfully. The hotel also features an amazingly charming restaurant that is specialized in both French and Moroccan cuisine but it is very pricey. Breakfast was served for us outdoors under the trees with abundance of fruit pastries jams and many other typical local foods. I would definitely recommend you stay at this hotel which is a real treat for the body and the heart (if you are lucky enough to share the experience with your special one).,Date of stay: July 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Madrid, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flawlessmary

Les Jardins de la Medina,Marclevin wrote a review Jun 2011,50,Perfect Escape in Marrakech,The place and staff were wonderful. It was a perfect place to escape. The resort is beautiful with gardens a pool and balconies from the rooms. The medina outside is busy and hectic and the hotel is an oasis of quiet. The staff was friendly and helpful and the breakfast buffet (included with the room) was fantastic. The garden is full of birds and one of my favorite things about the stay was to wake up to the sound of birds outside. There were only 2 downsides: it was a little far from the Square Djemaa el Fna (10 minute walk) and the fitness center had limited equipment (but made up for by its outdoor location overlooking the gardens of the hotel and the city skyline). The hotel is right near the gardens of the palace so a good place to go running. I would go back without hesitation and can strongly recommend this hotel to other travelers.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Onich wrote a review Jun 2011,40,A QUIET HAVEN IN BUSTLING OLD CITY.,Once you go through the wooden door you enter a haven of peace and good service. Cannot fault the staff at all and they were very helpful with everything we asked. It does take at least half an hour to get to your room having a welcome drink and a tour of the facilities.    We ordered a Privilege room  which had a private outside area with table chairs and loungers. Comfortable bed but small bathroom that was more ancient than old. I am fussy and for the price I would have appreciated a more up to date bathroom with a proper shower. This did not affect our visit at all and I became rather settled with the old fashioned atmosphere. Our daughter had a Superior room this was large and had a proper shower over the bath.    The restaurant is very good for both lunch and dinner. Breakfast has a lot of variety although too much sweet items for my taste. One eats outside and this is where the breakfast buffet is also set up. It seems a losing battle not to share the buffet with the local birds and bugs ! One day they did put the buffet indoors but I think this was to make room for all the guests staying.    The pool area is lovely and the pool is very inviting and clean.    The hotel is a very slow relaxed twenty minute walk from the main square. If it is too hot then a taxi can always be ordered and is very very cheap even if you do pay more as a tourist. Good recommended Restaurants seemed expensive for what they offered so worthwhile to ask the hotel or do some homework before you go out.    If you like TV this is not for you although BBC World might tell you if the world comes to an end. Free WiFi was available both in the rooms and by the pool and worked very well.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Cristi P wrote a review Jun 2011,50,great escape from the craziness...,"This hotel was more than we expected. The gardens and grounds were luxurious and private. Street noise and local children playing were a constant buzz but manageable. Our room was in the corner and very private. We were fortunate enough to be on the side of the grounds to not hear the 5 calls to prayer everyday including the 5am one! When we walked in off the extreme hustle and bustle of the streets it was like another world. Stress went from a 9 to a 2 within seconds. The staff while extremely curtious and attentive was still a little lacking. An example... we had the front desk order a taxi for us for dinner. We asked him how much we should expect to pay (locals pay a different price) and he told us ""usually 30 dirham but probably 40d for the distance of the restaurant never more than 50d"". When we walked out the door to get in the taxi we were asked for 60d. While in dollars this only amounts to about 50 cents it was none the less repeatedly irritating. The restaurant we went to was at the front desks recommdation. We picked an 8pm time he made the reservation for us but didn't tell us they don't sit people until 9pm. So the hostess looked at us funny for being so early then she sat us at the bar for an hour and then forgot we were there. They also assured us that an excursion we scheduled took credit cards only to be told at our 5.20am pick-up that that was not the case. We used almost all our cash on hand $512.00 to go anyway. That piece of information would have certainly been helpful! The beds are hard but the rooms are very clean. The tv only gets BBC. We never saw housekeeping because they were in and out in a short anount of time usually while we were at breakfast. Dining in the restaurant was enjoyable. My husband couldn't get enough of the Tanjine chicken and ordered it all three times we ate dinner there. It was good! I varied my order each time and was never totally satisfied with earth shattering delicious meals They were ""fine"". The pool was great but cold. Most of the lounge charis are in the shade but a nice spot to wile away the afternoon. The rooftop terraces are awesome.

We had two Privilege rooms for ourselves and our daughters aged 20 and 24. They were beautiful and very well serviced with some lovely surprises.  The restaurant food is excellent and easily compares with other top restaurants in Marrakech.  The ""stand out"" quality of the hotel its warm hospitality: very attentive but never intrusive.

I had travelled to Marrakech twice before and always stayed in the Palmerie but this time wanted to be in the thick of things but staying in a hotel with a garden was essential to me. An airy cool place to relax in in the heat of the day and equally a wonderful feeling of calm after spending a couple of hours in the Souk or the main square. The staff were charming and helpful anWonderful spa I had a massage which I think I can honestly say was the best I've ever had. The hotel is kept very clean. Pool side lunch/dinner very good if not a little pricey. I would recommend this hotel highly and long to return very soon - I urge you to stay there.,Date of stay: March 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rowingwidow
Les Jardins de la Medina,gill0galey wrote a review Mar 2011,50,lovely hotel. very kind staff,Hotel is set in the Kasbah area of the Medina. We wanted to experience the heart of Marrakesh and this is exactly what we got.  When the taxi stopped outside the red walls & brown wooden door that leads to the Ryad I was a bit concerned. However once through the door we were delighted to find a beautiful building set around a lovely garden with a swimming pool. A royal palace in previous times.  The rooms are large very clean comfortable beds good shower/bath & we had our own terrace. There was flat screen TV & DvD player.  The staff were very helpfull & cheerfull. We also had a drinks & canapes evening  with neck massage to help all the guests intermingle .. very nice!  The breakfasts were great. Lots of variety. Dinner in the restaurant was also worthwhile.  We walked eveywhere to get the feel of life there. Taxi's were everywhere but we enjoyed seeing the local shops & businesses.  Despite the freezing cold & wet weather .. a big surprise to us we loved Marrakesh & this would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone.,Date of stay: March 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Petersfield, England",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gill0galey

Les Jardins de la Medina,Chris31G wrote a review Mar 2011,50,A Moroccan Gem....beautiful setting in the middle of Kasbar,Just 15 mintues from the airport Jardin de la Medina is a beautifully presented riad just a 15 minute walk from the famous Jamel El Fna square. Set off the Rue de Kasbar it is hidden away and could easily be missed but once inside it is opulent yet understated. The gardens are full of birdsong and you have the choice of sunbathing around the pool or relaxing on the sofas on the terrace as the sun begins to set.  The food was lovely service excellent and setting perfect.  My only criticism would be the courtesy room. We checked out at 12 but were not flying until 8pm. The room is little more than a large toilet cubicle with a shower in it. There is no room to change inside the cubicle so you are forced to change outside with only a few floaty curtains to maintain your dignity.

We had an upgraded rooms with a private covered balcony and our very own private roof terrasse with sunbeds & shower. Sadly we did not have enough time on the terrasse. Location is excellent in the Medina (old town) within 10-15 minutes walk from Djemma Al Fna - but in a quet section of the Medina. The garden and bar/restaurant is such a charming supprise when you enter the property and the management's coctail reception during our stay is a great success among the guest that get tomingle and meet up to share experiences. We also tried the Spa having a full hammam & 25 minutes massage - the hammam was OK but does not compare to a turkish hammam and the massage were nice - next time I would skip the hammam and spend the money on a 50 minute massage.. :).  Make sure you have time to relax and enjoy the hotel if you go here - meaning dont spend all day sightseeing - but keep a part of the day for the garden/pool aera as it is a treat!

The central courtyard is quiet with a good size pool trees and the relaxing birdsong. The roof terrace is nicely furnished and was warm even in Jan. Rooms were large airy and tradtionally decorated. Bed was excellent. Beakfast was a very nice buffet and there were free cocktails and traditional entertainment on one evening. Lunch was also excellent and the staff were happy to serve it on the roof terrace. We didn't have dinner at the hotel. Only downsides were that it is located a good 15 minute walk from the central square also the hammam was a bit cold.

The hotel is based around a beautiful courtyard with a lovely pool and exudes an air of calm tranquillity (exactly the opposite of the scenes in the Medina).

Les Jardins de la Medina,Sprigun wrote a review Dec 2010,50,Charming converted palace,If you are looking for a place with a pool and good outdoor space to relax and sunbathe this is a much more interesting place than the boring purpose built new hotels. The main downside is that the main square is a long walk or short taxi ride away the hotel food is way too expensive and there isn't that much locally by way of good places to eat (the stork cafe being the one exception). On the upside there is a charming garden and lots of balconies some rooms have private roof space and generally a pleasure to be outside if the weather is good. It's a great place to explore the staff are very helpful and thefts are a few excise machos most of which work. The pool ISA not quite big enough to be much of an exercise option but was warm enough to swim in at Christmas.    Overall this is a great choice unless you want to be really close to the main nightlife and eating areas around the souks and are willing to trade this off for a higher price or more limited space.,Date of stay: December 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cambridge, UK",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sprigun

The accomodations are wonderful - light and stylish overlooking the large and beautifully kept gardens that give the place its name. The restaurant was amongst the best that we found in Marrakech. The optional cookery course is well worth it: excellent and friendly tuition leading to probably the best tajine we tasted during our stay: it made for a great lunch. The only criticism is the front desk. In contrast to all other staff those who man it are not over-friendly or helpful. Odd that what is often the most important and frequent point of contact for a hotel should be its weakest link when all other staff were exceptionally pleasant and helpful to deal with.

The walk to the main square although only 20 minutes was a tow in this type of heat and is definitely not for the faint hearted. Very much work in progress on some of the streets digging up the road & installing streetlights pavements etc around pedestrians.

Although there the walk to Jemma El Fna is an obstacle course and sidestepping speeding motos caleches and cars can be tiring the boys were tirelessly entertained by all they saw. I would recommend a taxi on your first day until you have adapted to Marrakeshi street life. The hotel itself was a gem...spotlessly clean. wonderful breakfasts and an excellent dinner there (once only for us as it is pretty expensive). We loved the sunbathing terraces overlooking the city with floaty muslin curtains and scatter cushions - all very decadent and appealing. The pool got quite busy around midday but the lush dense gardens give a sense of seclusion and privacy. We all used the mini gym and massage/beauty treatments (adequate - not brilliant). My husband and boys played tennis daily at the Royal Maroc tennis club too - ring the hotel in advance to book. The rooms were lovely - spacious and clean with beautiful tiling and luxorious argan oils to use. Crunchy starched cotton sheets and effective daily room cleaning. It felt very french with its eau de nil shutters and shaded terrace restaurant - until you woke to the sound of the tropical birds calling and noticed friendly tortoises (a great hit with my 11 yr old) bumbling around in the undergrowth. I particularly want to mention how the reception desk (staffed by ever helpful and charming personnel) sent out a porter at 11 pm to find antibiotic eye drops for my son. They arrived within half an hour and the problem was cleared up in24hrs. A lovely place - I was really sad to leave!,Date of stay: May 2010,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Nether Wallop, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EK88

Les Jardins de la Medina,Rosalind D wrote a review Apr 2010,40,a relaxing haven amid the hustle and bustle of the medina,We stayed in this riad a couple of weeks ago for a 4 night break. When we arrived at the door it was difficult to know what to expect but we were nicely surprised. It is very peaceful and attractive with all the rooms set around a courtyard with a small swimming pool and various nooks and crannies to sit in peace. The staff were very nice and helpful and spoke relatively good english but as we speak French it was'nt a problem anyway. Our room which was a superior one was on the first floor and was very big with a bath and shower which had rose petals scattered around on the first night a very nice touch. The only down side was it was extremely noisy as early as 5.30-6 in the morning as it appeared to be above the kitchen and dining area and also opposite the maid's cleaning cupboard and they seemed to start around 6am too! If I went again I would have a room elsewhere as the rooms along the courtyard away from the dining area and pool would be much quieter. The food was very good and we ate there all but one night. I would recommend going from a Thursday til Monday as there is a free drinks party on the Thursday which was nice to meet fellow guests and the owners on Friday they have a typical Morroccan evening and on Sunday there is a brunch. It is about a 20 minute walk to the main square and medina but a pleasant stroll and the taxis are cheap if you need one. A word of caution beware of getting lost in the medina itself as we could'nt find our way out for about two hours! All in all a very pleasant stay.,Date of stay: April 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Norwich, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roz1812
Les Jardins de la Medina,blah1025 wrote a review Apr 2010,40,beautiful gardens,Typical of Marrakech you walk through this non-descript door in a wall and find yourself in a really beautiful garden. We had 3 nights here exploring the medina. It's location at the southern end means everything's a bit of a walk (which suited us fine) but it's very quiet. We were a party of 11 so the pool got a good work out (quiet outside I meant); the rooms were fine and the breakfasts excellent. It's quite a large place (36 rooms I think) so it's not the intimate experience you find in a traditional riad. We enjoyed the roof terrace - large banquets interesting roof top views and great for a siesta. Service was of a high quality and the staff friendly and professional. No complaints at all but we didn't fall in love.,Date of stay: April 2010,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Melbourne, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blah1025

Les Jardins de la Medina,wsusan wrote a review Apr 2010,50,GREAT and would definitely stay there again.,Stayed at this hotel in February for 3 nights with my teenage daughter with another woman and her daughter. We had superior rooms with had a table and chairs on a balcony to sit and have coffee in the morning. Off the balcony you could walk up 17 stairs to a sun deck with 2 lounge chairs in total privacy. This worked for me as I could catch the morning sun after the roomservice delivered the breakfast which my teenage daughter slept until noon. You can listen to the birds which are in the orange trees outside of you room and not realize you are in Marrakesh. Omlettes on the breakfast menu were great and we ate several meals at the hotel which were great. Fries and club sandwiches were on the menu as well as local dishes. Staff were friendly and ordered taxis when needed. You can walk as well to some of the local shops as well as one fixed-priced shop. We had a later flight so after checking out of the room we stayed by the pool which is heated in the winter months. My daughter unknowingly had left her favorite jacket in the room and the cleaners brought it out to her by the pool!!! So small they know who you are after just a few days as the room service waiter my also be your waiter at lunch. Dinner was great and wine is on the menu by a half bottle if you don't want to get a full bottle. The reception desk was also willing to change British pounds to local currency saving us finding the local cash machine which can be a challenge. Also we had wireless internet with I think was free and great connection speed for teenagers to access Facebook. HIGHLY recommend this hotel.,Date of stay: February 2010,Trip type: Traveled with family,ascot,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wsusan

Walking into this Riad from the hustle/bustle of Marrakech was a big change !

During the stay we celebrated our wedding anniversary the staff presented us with flowers a wonderful pumpkin soufle - it made our anniversary very special!    Our room had a wonderful courtyard with two sun loungers and table and chairs where we had breakfast each day. The bed was so large and comfortable it was hard to leave it!  It is an easy 20 mins walk to the main square Djemaa El Fna from the hotel and even in the Kasbah you can find wonderful crafts gifts herbs and spices - this hotel has everything just outside the door - but inside you are in heaven.

We ate in the restaurant several times and the puddings are well worth saving room for. The hotel is a good 20 minute walk from the main square. It is possible to get a taxi but we walked and felt safe even late at night. The only negatives were that we were woken each morning at 5am by the call to prayer from a nearby mosque and we had to share breakfast with some very tame sparrows.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Mackerel_9 wrote a review Dec 2009,50,Beautiful calm oasis within walking distance of main attractions,We stayed here for three nights and were extremely pleased with what we found. Bedroom was spacious with its own terrace opening out into the garden. Garden is large and well-planted with lots of cool space to sit and relax. We sampled the restaurant which though not cheap offered good value for money and with a fire lit in the cool evenings was very comfortable and atmospheric. Although in the far south of the medina we found the walk up to the souks quite easy and found it better to be further away from the busier sections anyway All staff were delightful so all in all thoroughly recommended and we'd stay here again if we return to Marrakech.,Date of stay: December 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mackerel_9

Les Jardins de la Medina,swisstraveler63 wrote a review Nov 2009,40,"Fantastic garden, nice ambiance",Les Jardins de la Medina is located in the southern medina (accessible by car) in a former palace. The riad (hotel) has a little bit more than 30 rooms (quite a lot for a riad as they have usually only a few rooms). Our family (with one teen) had a double room ‚Äûprivil√®ge‚Äú which we liked as it was located on the top floor with a bigger room for the adults and a very small adjacent room (without windows) for our son. The bathroom was amply dimensioned and what we liked most was the spacious terrace going to the fantastic garden. You really have to point out this wonderful green oasis with wonderful plants and many birds singing in the morning very nice! There is also a small (outdoor) fitness room and a large swimming pool. Breakfast was good there was a good selection of western and oriental food. As far as dinner is concerned the menu is kept too ambitiously in my opinion. There are a lot of western dishes you wouldn‚Äôt eat in Morocco as you can‚Äôt be sure that these things (raw fish etc) agree with you. On the other hand the choice concerning Moroccan food isn‚Äôt wide.  All in all the riad is a nice accommodation for a few days in Marrakech but I would suggest that you have dinner elsewhere.,Date of stay: September 2009,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Olten, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swisstraveler63

Les Jardins de la Medina,holiday150 wrote a review Oct 2009,50,AMAZING FIND!,Just returned from the most relaxing 5 days at Jardins de la Medina.    It was such a hidden gem amongst the madness of Marrakech.    The service was very good on the whole however the language barrier was sometimes an issue - they mostly only understand French. So they said NO to some of our requests when they were possible. Occassionally forgot about our drinks order at the pool but we didn't mind as everything else was so perfect.    The only thing I would point out is the breakfast is not as good as it could be. They do offer eggs (found out from room service menu) however none of the staff seemed to be aware of this. We got them in the end!!    Lunch was fab.    If you're a sun lover ask for a room with private roof terrace as pool area gets shaded by palms late afternoon.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Noah H wrote a review Sep 2009,50,"This hotel excelled at every little detail, with no exceptions",My wife and I spent four days at the 'Jardins de la Medina' in Marrakech Morocco and found the entire experience to be among the best we have ever had if not the best in regard to a hotel stay. This is to include the grounds the hotel rooms the service the spa and hammam services the treatment of guests the food the beverages the pool the help on any and all of our many many questions to the front desk help with local restaurant recommendations taxi services et cetera. It is incredible to say but there was never a moment at the hotel when we did not feel entirely cared for by a supremely attentive and thoughtful staff.    Though the grounds are a 10-15 minute walk to the medina-proper it provides not only some time to gather your thoughts before you enter the insanity of the Jemaa El-Fnaa and the souks but it also provides a most welcome retreat and respite from the craziness and overwhelming experience of the public squares. It is an entirely different world at the hotel almost as if you have traveled to the middle of nowhere and yet you are only steps from the markets and public squares.    Overall we would recommend this hotel to any couple wishing to stay a few days in Marrakech and experience both the peace and tranquility that comes along with a perfect stay in a hotel but also the feeling of being just proximate to the one of the most amazing cities in all of Morocco and indeed North Africa.,Date of stay: August 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,New York,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nh2225

Les Jardins de la Medina,LonePool wrote a review Feb 2009,50,Relaxing haven of tranquility,"We were in Marrakech for a 3 day break with our two 11 year olds.    The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful with good English. The quality of everything was very good. The wow factor was the gardens which really are like they show on their web-site complete with bird song. I'd certainly visit here again.    The hotel offers an option where you can get picked up from the airport in a horse and cart. This worked really well and the kids loved it.    A couple of things to think about. I got money out of the cash point at the airport which worked fine expept that it all comes out in large demomination notes. What I saved on transaction fees I lost in giving the most generous sized tips in Marrakech.    We re-employed the excellent horse and cart driver for the afternoon and he dropped us off at a carpet shop where we ""lost"" an hour and ended up buying a carpet. It was entertaining but I'm sure we paid well over the top despite the haggle (a common feeling in Marrakech - they are expert negotiatorss we just amatueurs). My advice is to make it clear at the start that you want sightseeing not shopping.    Finally there are no fastfood outlets or supermarkets and none of the restaurants seem to have childrens' (plain food) options - so if you have a fussy eater with you (as we did) then you might want to take out a few snacks with you.

The Riad is a 20 minute walk from the main Square within the Medina. We took a walking guide on Day 1 to aquaint ourselves with the myriad of narrow streets and souks surrounding the Square.

Les Jardins de la Medina,prettyaxolotl wrote a review Nov 2008,40,full of surprises,The first thing to mention about this riad is that it is situated in a residential area a few roads away from the Saadian Tombs and the Sultana Riad but still not in a tourist area so a very authentic atmosphere as you walk/drive up to the riad with lots of locals milling about in the narrow roads fixing bikes selling bread and grilling meat. We arrived at the hotel in the afternoon walked into the cool reception and were whisked through into the garden to sit on the sofas and fill out a form while drinking mint tea and sampling sultanas and dates brought in tagine dishes. There was a wonderful display of flowers next to us in a fountain all very relaxing and easy and when we had finished we were shown to our rooms by the porter.  The room we stayed in was a superior one twin beds two day beds/sofas which i actually slept on split level and a bathroom with bath/shower. The room was clean freshly painted although the decor was a little tired/sparse. It seems dark in the rooms in contrast to outside but warm and cosy enough (it gets cold at night and in the morning in November)  There were rooms around the riad which seemed to have their own private balconies etc but we found plenty of private spaces to sit the roof being particularly lovely. The windows at the back of the room which opened onto the road were double glazed and cut out the 'atmospheric' noise quite well the front windows were shuttered and you could hear quite clearly the hotel noise (people walking to their rooms). Having said this i am an extreemely light sleeper if i get to sleep at all and after the first night i did tune out of the noises calls to prayer etc none of them were what i would class as annoying noise no hotel music etc. The bathroom was ok tiled under floor heating a bit of mould round the fixings. Nice deep bath. Lovely big long mirror.  The accomodation was set on three levels around the garden quite substantial in size with lots of hidden hammocks and little seating daybed areas. The planting was lush with tall palm trees hedges grassy areas lots of bird life and apparently chameleons and tortoises which we couldn't find! Our favourite place to sit was on the roof terrace as it was sunny although in summer season i'm sure the cooler garden would be best! The pool looked lovely although we didn't go in.  There was a hammam on the ground floor a small shop a cookery school and a massage/ beauty centre on the roof. We had massages - very relaxing and generous with the oil in a nice warm room where two people can have massage at the same time.  The restaurant was next to the pool with outdoor and indoor seating. The chairs indoor were more comfortable and a grander affair whereas the outside area was more relaxed with heaters to keep off the cold.  One thing to mention is that the staff were not competent English speakers this is really a French hotel and the lunchtime menus were all in French. The staff were not able to translate all of the dishes so it was a bit of pot luck. There were also no vegetarian options so fish was the closest choice.  The evening menu was varied but not big on traditional Moroccan food which was a shame the dishes all looked lovely and were quite experimental for example john dory and lychees duck sweede and kiwi fruit! Some hits some misses.  For food elsewhere i would reccomend the Sultana up an alleyway next to the Saadian Tombs - amazing atmosphere extreme luxury and food excellent and also Al Fassia in Gueliz area for exceptional Morrocan food and Cafe16 in the New Town for lunch and cake.  Room service was limited to a smallish menu with omlettes burgers at certain times and other more fancy food all a bit strange. There were no tea making facilities which was annoying and meant frequent calls to try to explain that we wanted black tea not mint tea cold milk hot water sugar etc which would then turn up with no spoons! They got used to our order in the end and were really friendly and fun. I happened to celebrate my birthday whilst i was there and they found this out presumably through the card i had in the room and made me a cake and brought me a present and all came to sing me happy birthday! Even more strangely this happened to me in another restaurant i went to - marrakech is an unusual place.  A word of warning the taxis charge all sorts of prices usually much higher than they should. Petit taxis should be on a meter but some insist on charging 50 dirham instead of 6! The ones called from the hotel were just as bad so don't assume they are vetted.  Overall a nice pretty riad with friendly staff in an interesting residential area. Quiet inside the garden apart from the generators. Not bad noise in the rooms and fairly comfortable.  If you want total luxury try the nearby Sultana. If you prefer relaxed open air prettiness this is the one.    In response to the negative feedback -  the walk to the Saadian Tombs we didn't find as difficult as some people have said although you do have to dodge lots of people carts cars and worst many mopeds. I would worry if i had children with me that they may be run over. Nice atmospheric walk (you may be the only tourists) although as with everywhere in Marrakech extremely polluted from moped fumes. Walk to the Djemaa El-Fna for us was too far and we got taxis then walked.  All windows and lights worked perfectly.  Menu was inflexible nothing very light or vegetarian. Expensive.  It was clean the bedroom maids would get you anything you need just not the standard of a luxury hotel bedroom but big.    As for the food we eat most of our meals here and were not ill at all i have a very weak stomach but had no problems. However we were careful and avoided salad peeled fruit and only used bottled water for our teeth etc.,Date of stay: November 2008,,london,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prettyaxolotl

Les Jardins de la Medina,sforzando8 wrote a review Oct 2008,40,Great in many ways,The hotel (particularly the common areas) was- beautiful- nice pool and lounge areas. great breakfast. staff was super friendly and very welcoming and accomodating to our 19 month old daughter. the room was nice- nothing fancy but it did the trick (although DEFINITELY not soundproof- we could hear the people in the room next door the entire time).  definitely an oasis of calm in the midst of the chaos that is marrakech!    our big complaint was the driver they hired to drive us to dinner (far out in the suburbs with our little girl)- when he came to pick us up he had another man with him who was obviously drunk the car reeked of alcohol and we were unsure of how sober the driver himself was. being stuck in the middle of NOWHERE though (we went to Chez Ali which is a dinner/show and it's pretty far outside of the city in a very remote location) not speaking french or arabic and with no cell phone at 11:30 pm- we felt completely trapped and had no way to get back to the hotel other than our driver. definitely a terrifying ride back to the hotel. so we wish that the hotel had vetted the drivers they recommend a little more carefully.  otherwise a great stay.,Date of stay: October 2008,Trip type: Traveled with family,"boston, ma",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sforzando8

Madness! And then we pull up to a small wooden door and step into another dimension. Peace and serenity surround you. The garden is lush the pool sparkling the service impeccable. They served us mint tea and snacks upon arrival and offered us a seat in the courtyard. After long hours of travel this was peace at last! The staff was so wonderful and helpful. They assisted us in both making reservations at restaurants and finding a great guide for the city. The breakfast buffet was a perfect way to start each day as the doves coo softly above you. The rooftop ""louge"" area has a nice view of two mosques illuminated at night. This was such a fantastic place to return after long hot days of exploring Marrakech. It is right in the medina so you are close to the bustling vibrant life of the city but you can escape within moments to this very luxurious retreat.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Frenchgate2 wrote a review Aug 2008,40,Very Nice,This Ryad is very nice. Good setting and extremly relaxing. Rooms a decent size with cosy mezzanine and spacious roof terrace. Pool area relaxing. The Restaurant had a decent (if a bit expensive) menu and we enjoyed a few meals there. They would perhaps benefit from more variety? It was bit worrying that so many people suffered from D&V's (including me) and some pointed towards the kitchen (I wasn't pointing). Perhaps the major downside is the location. Its a fair bit away from the main centre (such that it is) and so a taxi was the order of the day.,Date of stay: August 2008,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Richmond, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Frenchgate2
Les Jardins de la Medina,Abimartin wrote a review Feb 2008,50,Amazing hotel,After reading many reviews on various hotels in Marrakech I decided on this hotel. It completely lived up and exceeded my expectations. From the minute we arrived to the time we left the staff and hotel fulfilled our every need. We are were two femail friends travelling together and were very happy with the service we were provided. The walk in to the main square in Marrakech was a hectic but interesting one so don't let this put you off. You are staying in a very nice part of the town and the locals are very friendly.    The swimming pool could have been slightly warmer but the other facilities are all spot on. Breakfast was a very nice relaxing affair. The room was amazing. The balcony and views were a welcome unexpected treat so was the roses that were put on the bed each evening.    I would not hesitate in recomending this hotel to anyone. It is good value for money and makes your trip to Marrakech a very stress free experience.,Date of stay: January 2008,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Worcestershire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Abimartin

Stepping into the Hotel Les Jardins de la Medina off the hot dusty and bustling street in Marrakech you find a haven of peace and tranquility. There is a bar/restaurant set in the magnificent garden with its wonderful trees and tranquil surroundings. The service was excellent the staff were most helpful and could not do enough for us. We had a superior room which was lovely (we looked out onto the garden and we had a terrace with table and chairs). During our 1 week stay we had 3 dinners (one of which was their Moroccan Evening which was excellent value as you paid only for your food and the entertainment was free and 3 lunches in the restaurant all the food was excellent as were the Moroccan wines.

Les Jardins de la Medina,wanderingPYT wrote a review Jul 2007,40,wonderfully charming!,When choosing our hotel for our trip to Marrakech my best friend and I had it narrowed down to either the famous La Mamounia or Les Jardins de la Medina. We opted for the latter because we wanted a more authentic personal experience. As soon as we walked through the massive front door we knew that we had made the right decision. The grounds of the hotel were absolutely charming and the staff very accomodating. The calm and quiet hotel was the perfect sanctuary to come back to after spending the day immersed in the hustle and bustle of the Jemaa el Fna square and shopping in the souks. Our Superior room was perfect immaculate and beautifully decorated.    We booked a personal tour of all of the sites through the hotel. Our tour guide showed up in a 3 piece suit! If you are lucky enough to have a day to spare I recommend booking an excursion to Ait Benhaddou. About a four hour drive from Marrakech but well worth the journey.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Lorenzo M wrote a review Jul 2007,40,"fantastic rooms, shame about the service","Well it was like walking into paradise after walking through the streets to get there. The hotel is conveniently located about 15-20 minutes walking from Jemma el Fna. But walking there and back can be quite stressful for some people as cars and bikes whiz pass on the narrow and bustling streets.    Once inside it feels very grand. We got offered a drink while we sat and filled in our hotel cards. We were shown to our room which was very nice indeed. Nice comfortable large bed. Beautiful tiles on the floor and walls. Windows overlooking the courtyard and swimming pool. Swimming pool was clean but not nearly enough chairs around the pool for the amount of people using it.    The staff seemed to be trying a bit too hard to please and were always in our face. It just seemed they were being forced to do something they didn't really want to do. I asked myself on various occasions ""what happened to a service with a smile?"" They didn't help create a relaxing atmosphere which is what I would expect from a hotel at this price.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Rik H wrote a review Feb 2007,50,Would return,I've stayed in countless hotels; this was certainly the nicest! The service wasn't perfect the facilities weren't the best of the best but such things didn't matter. The place is beautifully decorated and absolutely charming. It's an oasis of sanity and serenity away from the madness that is the medina.    We were lucky: we had a free room upgrade presumably due to them running out of space. Ours was a 'superior' room with a small lounge area and a private balcony overlooking a part of the downstairs. The room was very tastefully decorated and the cleaners seemed to visit more than once a day. The bed was huge and very comfortable.    The staff were all very friendly and keen to help. They all spoke enough English for us to be able to converse with them when our rudimentary French reached its limits. If you have a basic grasp of French ('O' level) then you'll do fine in Marrakech at least with shopping and eating.    The food in the hotel was superb. Proper vertical food. It was priced appropriately - a three course meal for two with a bottle of wine costing around ¬£50. By contrast a decent meal (tagine and juice) at a restaurant in the main square might cost ¬£8 (for two people).    The restaurant/bar have a decent selection of foreign and Moroccan wines. The Moroccan wines are quite cheap by hotel standards - about ¬£9 for the S√©millant which was fruity and very drinkable. The foreign wines were at more usual prices.    Breakfast was pretty much like you'd find in any decent hotel. There was bread for toasting pastries scrambled egg bacon(!) hot tomatoes sausages dried and fresh fruit yoghurts cheeses those weird spongy pancakes fruit juices plus a woman with a frying pan who would make you an omelette or fried egg to order.    The pool area was relaxed and the pool itself was clean and warm enough at about 11am (bravery required to enter but fine once you're in). Unlike some hotels I've been to you're allowed drinks by the pool. Drinks from the bar always seem to come with nuts and/or olives.

Les Jardins de la Medina,riolacala wrote a review Aug 2006,10,very poor!!,For the price charged this hotel fell well below expectation. Despite having pre-arranged early breakfast on the first morning of our stay the night manager had no knowledge of this when we arrived at midnight. We were told that early breakfast was impossible. After we persisted he reluctantly agreed to provide a basic breakfast at 6am. He wasn't joking - the breakfast was less than basic. When we requested coffee we were treated to a lecture about his function as a Duty Manager and not a Chef ! The bedrooms were ok but nothing special. The dinner menu was limited and extremely expensive. Minibar prices were outrageous. The Hotel was clean but lacked atmosphere. No water in the shower on the morning of departure. Our rating would be a poor 3 star with very bad customer service and a total rip-off.

Les Jardins de la Medina,Londongirl79 wrote a review Aug 2006,40,Oasis,After hot and hassled days in the Souk or wandering the Kasbah the hotel was like an oasis to come back to. Tucked away in the Kasbah a little door on a dirt track road opens up to a beautiful complex with a fairly good sized pool and great suites.    The service was great from the chocolate left on your pillow to the waiter who gets up and sings and dances with the band on Morrocan night.    Only down side is the food and drink is a bit expensive comparitvely- as you would expect of a hotel of this standard - and they only serve full on meals at lunch time which you don't really want in the midday heat leaving you to wait til 1530 before you can order a simple snack or sandwich.,,,"Haddenham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Londongirl79

Anyone we met up with said the same-  Very overpriced and not worth it.When we arrived we were promised a welcome drink that never arrived. The staff were very rude and unhelpful with couldnt care less attitudes.(youre only the guest after all who has payed good money to stay here)Breakfast was a shambles of people sharing food with the birds and wasps (I was stung whilst at the pool) they just turn away and are unhelpful - also if you love the sun - get up early as by midday most sun chairs are in the shade) lunch and dinner very overpriced (¬£9.00 for a small portion of goats cheese on toast) water was ¬£2.00 for a bottle (outside there is a small kiosk it costs just over 20p a bottle - the owner is charming)The rooms were basic and bland and need a good overhaul and clean not at all like their website promises and very noisy - not soundproofed at all you can hear all that happens outside without leaving the room. watchout for the dawn chorus it starts at 5.00am and continues until evening! And listen out for the breakfast laying staff at 6.00am no need for an alarm clock at this hotel.If you do need and alarm call ask for one an hour before you need it as you wont get one on time - they have a habit of forgetting. In all VERY DISSAPOINTING-please note the Riad isnt very central for sightseeing and you will need to take a taxi everywhere - thats the only thing thats cheap!!

Les Jardins de la Medina,Jameson2 wrote a review May 2006,10,A HUGE dissapointment,We had selected Les Jardins de la Medina because it appeared to have the location and quality of facilities that we were looking for to relax after our journey through the desert. Sadly this was not our experience. The welcome was underwhelming and the form filling seemed more ardous than in previous accommodation. There was no offer of mint tea that is wonderfully common as you travel around. Being a small hotel we had expected that there would be greater flexibility with meals than the formal structure of the Riads but the reality was quite the contrary. Food arrangements were limited to set lunch and dinner with many courses and if you wished for something lighter than all they could offer was a selection from those dishes but you paid the full set price. The hotel had been built some years earlier to a reasonable standard but has not been maintained so that doors and shutters are either too loose or do not open without muscles and passage lights don't work. The staff could not have cared less when we made comments. To add insult to injury we were contacted after our return about not having paid all of the accommodation costs even though 100% had been taken by credit card by the hotel before we arrived! Definately not a place to be recommended or worth the price paid.,Date of stay: April 2006,,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jameson2

Les Jardins de la Medina,Lesley L wrote a review Apr 2006,50,Peaceful Haven,A lovely peaceful haven hidden behind a wooden door in one of the quieter streets in the Medina in Marrakech. Everything about this hotel was enchanting. It is a Riad in the Medina (Old Town) of Marrakech and as is typical of this type of accommodation had a lovely central courtyard. This one was big enough to have a nice size swimming pool with plenty of sunbeds around it and lots of trees with tables set out. There was also a marquee structure attached to the main building to provide semi outdoor eating which in April was ideal. We stayed there for 3 nights from 17th April 2006 and would have happily stayed another 2/3 days. We had a lovely room with its own terrace with seating. We also had a lovely massage at a very reasonable price. The staff were all very helpful.
