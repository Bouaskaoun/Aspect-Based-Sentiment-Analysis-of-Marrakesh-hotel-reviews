Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Rich P wrote a review Mar 10,50,Don’t let the bad bits put you off….it’s great!,Just back from 5 nights in the Hotel Du Golf and probably a couple of KG heavier! The room…we were accommodated in a ground floor pool view room with a comfortable Super King Sized bed. It was spacious and clean with all the amenities we needed. Air conditioning was adequate but not particularly effective and the shower was behind the free standing bath which was a strange design that allowed water to pool behind the bath. The Pool…Freezing cold but refreshing when the temperature soared to 29C. The decking was dangerously unstable but the manager assured me this was due to be renovated an area at a time soon. Pool bar was welcome an supplied ice cold beer and wine on request and the pool staff were very helpful. Food was excellent we utilised the buffet breakfast lunch and dinner and couldn’t fault it for choice and quality. The staff were also excellent they couldn’t do enough for us and really went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. Special mentions must go to Tarik and Jasmiina for their hospitality. The hotel is getting a little tired but it was a lovely holiday and we would definitely go back.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Chesterfield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/258richp
Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Jo B wrote a review Mar 10,50,Great holiday!,We have just returned from a week in Marrakech at this hotel. The following should help you decide whether or not it is for you!  1. Beautiful location situated about twenty minutes from Marrakech Medina but hotel offers a regular free shuttle bus into town.  2. The resort is a little tired in places but overall it really is pretty with a gorgeous pool and gardens. There is also a wonderful indoor spa pool situated 5 minutes from main hotel. We used this every morning - we didn’t play golf but other guests said the course plays well. The golf club building is truly beautiful and staff were fantastic when we had dinner there  3. The staff and customer service was faultless - we were really looked after and all done with a smile.  4. The food was delicious with a wide choice of dishes - particularly recommend the pastries and in addition to the main buffet restaurants you have a choice of two other restaurants - both were excellent but make sure you book in advance.  Wine was also very good - lovely pale rose and great G&Ts!  5. Mohammed is in charge of the trips and he is great! We went to the Three Valleys - it was a wonderful experience and good value. Just make sure you ask him to explain what the trips involve.  Great hotel booked via Voyage Prive - all inclusive so good value for the quality of the hotel and its excellent facilities. A big thank you to all the staff at the Golf du Rotana!,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jobJ3996JF
Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Christine T wrote a review Mar 9,50,Friendly high class hotel,Myself and a friend just visited this hotel for one week for some winter sun and to explore Marrakesh and the Atlas Mountains. Where to start… fantastically fabulous on every level. Food is 5 star a lovely combination of Moroccan international and topped off with French pastries to die for. The service from ALL staff was friendly helpful and up there with the best I’ve ever known. Nothing is too much trouble to give you a wonderful stay. Our room was comfortable quiet and spacious with daily cleaning. The wine and gin and tonics excellent all available on all inclusive. They have two outdoor pools (only one heated) and a wonderful pool in the nearby spa. I cannot fault this hotel it is wonderful. One other thing is the hotel also offers trips and MOHAMMED is available to help you choose which ones would be perfect for you. He provides a very good helpful friendly service. We did the Atlas Mountains and three valleys and a visit to the local Hammam. Pick ups and drop offs were prompt and very well organised. I totally recommend this hotel,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrissyt08

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Shakira Lorraine wrote a review Jan 2023,30,A really Honest review - not the worse but wouldn't rush back.,So my friend and I booked a last minute trip To Marrakesh for New Years and stayed at this hotel. It was supposed to be all-inclusive however was told that this was not an option and only breakfast was included. The hotel room was very basic even after upgrading to a better room. We requested a golf view and got a perfect view of bushes and lemon trees! - wasn't bad but definitely was not the view of the golf course.    The reception staff are somewhat unhelpful/rude/stand offish with the exception of the lady with a blonde short bob and red lipstick (I forgot her name apologises). We wasn't given any information on check in nothing on entertainment restaurants facilities bus timetables to go into the square (markets). I had to go back to reception the next morning to request this. Was given a map/information leaflet written in French ( I understand it's a French speaking country just thought more languages would be available given it's a tourist hotel).    I found the breakfast to be very limited as i do not eat meat. The lovely ladies who make you omelettes in the morning used the same utensils/mixing bowl for the meat and veg. This was extremely shocking to me given that it is a Muslim country I would have thought they would have a separate bowl/utensils for pork.    The gym/spa is quite a walk away from the hotel room on the 3rd day we were told about the hotel cars that can take you to and from by the door staff/ concierge. - they are by far the most helpful members of staff.    Taxi's to the new town/Gueliz will cost about 100DH during the day and double at night so be prepared to haggle and argue it down. If you can try and get a card for a reasonable taxi driver and stick with them.    It's not the most awful hotel but it's just definitely not a 5* more like a 4 ? if you are use to 5* resorts then you will be disappointed.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShakiraLorraine
Hotel Du Golf Rotana,F00DCR1T1C2 wrote a review Dec 2022,20,"What could of been a lovely break was absolutely not! Poor service, bad attitudes and rundown property",We picked this to get away over Christmas. The pictures do not reflect the current state of the hotel! It is run down and unloved with less than half the restaurants open. The holiday started off well as we were collected as booked by the hotel 4X4. We ere shown to our 1st room which had a string stench of raw sewage - we obviously declined this room. We had booked two rooms to be adjoining. The second choice of room was virtually in opposite sides of the hotel complex. Apparently they did have rooms next door to one another when I pushed for these. As it was Christmas Eve we booked to be in one of the other restaurants rather than the buffet - we informed them of the food allergy in the party. We turned up for our reservation and after some discussion we were told to be told that rather than the 5 course meal they would be getting just the one course! We promptly left. We had dinner in the buffet where we were told at 9:30pm they had ran out of red wine! We felt the tone had now been set but were willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. That didn't last long - the service by the pool has also been appalling with wrong drinks and food delivered running out of drinks by 3pm and even being told to fetch milk from the kitchen if you want a latte! The food in the buffet has been adequate but frequently runs out by 9pm so don't eat late! We usually go down at 8pm and struggle. They have tried half heartily to cater for the allergy - so unusually in 2022! Then top off your evening in the bar where they will serve you IF they feel like it!    We did bring the issues to the attention of the management but no change really.    The rooms have been meticulously looked after by the wonderful lady taken care of them. Spotless and nothing too much trouble.    The Hammam and Spa have also been excellent and the staff attentive and knowledgeable.    One of the ladies on reception Rana has been particularly helpful and friendly. She has tried her best to make this a more enjoyable stay. Alas she is just one of the people we have encountered and a minority in her approach to customer service.    For those three reasons I have given them 2 rather than 1 in my review.,Date of stay: December 2022,,"Swindon, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F00DCR1T1C2

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Jem D wrote a review Nov 2022,30,"Uninspiring hotel, challenging reception staff and in need of a facelift",We booked indirectly (Voyage Prive) and on arrival were told by reception staff that our reservation had been declined they were full and we should contact Voyage Prive a great start (not) to a 60th birthday retreat. Reception staff were just so matter of fact and unhelpful. It turned out there was a Voyage Prive Rep in the hotel and he agreed to sort things out and asked us to wait. Two hours later we were still waiting and having checked on-line with the Rotana website we knew there was availability so approached the reception again only to be told they had no rooms. We asked to see the manager explained the situation and our on-line enquiry and suddenly they had a room for us! Unfortunately after such a poor and unnecessary first impression we started to become more sensitive to drawbacks and faults at this hotel. The main dining room is on the lower ground floor beneath reception it's a self service buffet and you find you own seat and then have to catch the eye of a waiter to have any drinks. The food is good there is a wide selection whilst there only 2 of the 'premier' restaurants were open neither busy but the hotel insist you book 24 hours in advance. The Golf Club bar was relaxed but the options were limited and more like bar food The Italian was quite basic and we food the staff rude. The Pool Bar is ok quality of service was variable no ne explains what is covered under the all-inclusive option we had taken at any time. The Pool side snack bar was ok again only offering 50% of the normal menu. We assume we were outside the main season the hotel was (apart from our last day) very quiet and tired around the edges definitely time for a refurb across the board. The pool was cold not heated and the boardwalk around the outside is a trip hazard beds were basic and towels provided were far too small for the loungers. We had a great time in Marrakesh but spent as little time in the hotel as possible. We were not allowed a late checkout and the only shower and changing facilities are underground near the pool and were disgusting. Shame as I am a Rotana Rewards Member having stayed in other Rotana hotels but this one was the worst by far ultimately I know our initial experience clouded our stay but this is not a 5 start resort by UK standards possibly low 4 star but definitely needs a refurb and some customer service skills training for its reception staff. Waiters in the main dining area were great,Date of stay: November 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JemD_12

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Lynne M wrote a review Nov 2022,50,Lovely October stay,We (2 adults and 2 teenage boys) stayed at the Hotel Du Golf Rotana for 5 nights over October half-term. The accommodation facilities restaurants/food more than met our expectations. My sons (both playing off scratch) took the opportunity to play 4 rounds of golf use the practice facilities and the well equipped gym.    Having worked in hospitality for years I have to say that the staff really do make the hotel. They were excellent - all very attentive and genuinely keen for guests to have a great stay and return again.    Restaurant wise my sons loved the flexibility of eating at the Zest Restaurant and the bar/food area near the pool. The highlight of our stay food wise were two evenings when we dined at Pasta Cosy - delicious meals both times!    Thank you team Hotel Du Golf Rotana.  We hope to visit again.,Date of stay: October 2022,,"Chester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lynnem627

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Tariq A wrote a review Sep 2022,10,Scam alert - be careful staying at this hotel,Upon arriving the hotel tried to make me pay twice for the rooms! Further to this when I added an additional room again they tried to charge me twice! Once can be a potential mistake but to do this twice is attempted fraud. Careful when booking a massage...they will leave you short on the time...we paid for 30 mins but the massage lasted only 20 mins. One of their restaurants tried to charge us twice for the same items. Throughout the resort will try to scam you for money. This completely kills any enjoyable experience because you end up not trusting anyone at the hotel and you feel like you need to be mindful of every interaction which required payment. I actually emailed the hotel directly with these issues but they do not care. They have not even bothered to respond!,Date of stay: September 2022,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tariqa641

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Frederic R wrote a review May 2022,50,People going beyond normal Hotel service,Went for Business to this hotel although the hotel was fully booked you couldn't notice this as still plenty of places available on the different Sundeck chairs.  Although in the middle of the week outside of children's holidays the kids club was available for young kids <12 years.    The reception staff really helped me on 2 occasions.  - a light in the bathroom was on the night of day 1 impossible to turn off (The next day reported it at reception and the day itself it was repaired)  - Wanted on an evening at 22h00 a small bite (didn't want a full buffet) Reception drove me to the Italian restaurant of the same hotel and made sure I was well taken care of. I could have asked for a driver to bring me back but preferred the 10 min walk back to my room.

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Jessica wrote a review Oct 2021,50,Lovely hotel,A wonderful hotel for exploring marrakech- we stayed here for 10 days all inclusive and it really was brilliant- we had an initial hiccup as we were supposed to be staying in the Palmeraie Rotana but this was sorted in a matter of hours by Fatima on the front desk- she was fantastic and answered my many questions about the facilities. The room was lovely and clean all the common areas were really clean and housekeeping staff always seemed busy in the background. The pool facilities were lovely- the pool itself was cooler but perfect in the hot sun. There was always a sun bed free which was great. The hotel staff all spoke French but their English was really good too!  The food was nice- breakfast was a good selection of continental breakfast items (fruit cereals pastries) as well as pancakes and omelettes cooked fresh and a small selection of hot items Samira (pancakes) was lovely and once they knew my order it was brought to my table. I recommend trying the Moroccan pancakes with honey. Tea and coffee was fair and there was also a selection of fresh juices. Khalid brought us drinks and was really attentive at breakfast.  The food choices were a little limited from the all inclusive as it was the same every day (we usually ate at olive grill at lunch and Zest for dinner). There were menus but we did have one or two buffet nights. The quality was lovely and always very tasty. A special thanks to Tarik at Zest- he was really friendly and looked after us so well in the evenings. Ali and Mohammed at Olive grill were also helpful and attentive.  The hotel is quite far from the main town (15/20 minute car ride from town) and there is very little to do in walking distance (unless you want quad bikes or camel rides on the Palmeraie) but the hotel shuttle was good- the staff dropped us off and picked us up as agreed. We did also get a taxi on a couple of occasions- taxi drivers didn’t know the hotel very well so I would suggest having google maps or similar on your phone if you can! Especially as they don’t always speak English.  We took a number of tours through trip advisor or other websites and hotel pick ups went smoothly on all accounts.  There was a small shop on the Palmeraie resort complex for small souvenirs but we did most of our shopping in the town. There was also a bank and cash machine on the complex (near the gym). We also managed to change some money up at reception but they didn’t have many small bills (same with the cash machine- the smallest amount was 100dr).,Date of stay: October 2021,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Folkestone, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M2488OLjessicaa
Hotel Du Golf Rotana,rani wrote a review Sep 2021,40,Another wonderful stay here!,While there are many hotel  choices in Marrakech I always choose this property and the reason is simply their friendly staff and their desire to please their guests.  On this trip 3 staff members really stood out; they were Samira Charaf and Abdelsamad. Their professionalism friendliness and dedication to guest service are exceptional.  The property was exceptionally clean and the rooms were very comfortable although I received bath towels that were less than satisfactory they seemed a bit old so I called and Mrs. Samira immediately sent new plush towels.  The food is always delicious and the grounds impeccable. The swimming pools were incredibly clean and sparkling! The view of the swimming pool from my room was blocked by and extremely large palm tree I did wish the tree was not in that spot.

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,888desg wrote a review Nov 2019,40,A very easy place to stay.,We went to Marrakech in October for my wife's birthday and so that I could play a little golf. Unfortunately the weather was unseasonably hot being over 40 degrees which ruled out the latter. Still we were lucky enough to find this complex of hotels restaurants and facilities which made the heat at least manageable.    This is a very easy place to stay. The staff in particular were first class. Nothing was too much trouble at any time from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. The driver and car were there at the airport as ordered and indeed all the transport services  to get you around this enormous complex of two hotels several restaurants a night club and the golf course were well organized and efficient.    We stayed in a large room with two double beds and a wet room which made our lives very easy indeed given my wife’s bad back. It overlooked the excellent pool area. Some facilities for example the fitness centre and spa were at the neighboring hotel (the Palmeraie Palace) but this is no distance to walk although the hotel transport service is there in seconds should you need it.    The main restaurant in the hotel is used principally for breakfast which is an extensive buffet with egg station as you would expect. In the morning it is light and airy with a terrace; however in the evening the restaurant is open but is dark and sombre and so is little used. We used other restaurants in the hotel which I will write about separately.    In summary the room was fine and everything worked; and you can eat well; the staff it must be repeated are among the best I have ever experienced but overall it isn’t a 5 star hotel. However this is really only because it is just a bit scruffy around the edges everywhere. It would help substantially to have a full makeover in reception in the main restaurant and on the adjacent terraces.    I forgot one thing. There is a little tailor who provides excellent quality clothes for both men and women at very reasonable prices.,Date of stay: October 2019,,"Lyon, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/888desg
Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Dave C wrote a review Nov 2019,10,The worst 5 stars hotel ever,I’m traveling really often for work and leisure and it’s rare that I’m writing reviews but I must make this review because this hotel is extremely overrated I am guessing how they could give to this place 5 stars for the service it deserves maximum 2 stars. The employee in the reception was rude and not even able to check the availability of the room in order to extend it... seems a joke but unfortunately it’s true. I ask to speak with a manager but she told me that was not possible.. unbelievable. In addition in the morning there is such a bad smell outside the room that it seems you have a open sewer in the lobby which they try to hide with a lot of air freshener that is making the situation even worst.  Last but not less important the food is pricey for the quality offered.    So there are many hotels around I suggest to avoid this one.,Date of stay: November 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Milan, Italy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z4961WYdavec

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Tahir wrote a review Sep 2019,10,AVOID AT ALL COSTS.,A returning guest from the year before I reluctantly came back as part of a group for a 5 night stay:    1. On arrival the porters simply point you to your room no effort to show you to your room hotel layout confusing.  2. Took 2 hours and several calls for an iron only to arrive after requesting a board as well. I was then showed how I could stretch my shirt over the writing desk in the room! Needless to say it didn’t fit he nearly ripped my shirt. Ironing board was finally brought but the legs were broken.  3. Room service awful ordered food paid cash. Guy never came back with 80 Dirhams change from a 200 Dirham note. Took 2 days to resolve on verge of threatening reception with the Police.  4. Restaurant Le Brassiere two hours for the mains to come asked for discount reluctantly given after arguing.  5. Reception/room service rarely pick up the phone.  6. Food and drink prohibitively expensive.  7. Receptionists rude uncaring and don’t offer to help at all.  8. Pool decking worn screws sticking up. One of the guys had a splinter stuck in his foot.  9. Hotel room key card deactivated several times. Each time had to reactivate at reception after being locked out.  10. Hotel buffet dinner simply awful not worth the money.    Others in the group had upset stomachs saw crockery/drink glasses being re-used breakfast fruit juices being poured back into dispensers from guest leftovers.

When I arrived in my room it was barely cleaned: the table and chairs were dirty the carpet was barely vacuumed! I stayed at a 3-star riad in Marrakesh and I have to say that it was cleaner than this pretentious resort.    The quality of the food wasn't great either. It appeared that at the breakfast and dinner buffet they were serving items from the previous days. The food looked very dodgy and expired. The taste was pretty awful and caused me bad stomachaches. The cutlery wasn't washed properly and it was dirty the glasses in which they served the mint tea were dirty too. I was lucky for getting away with stomachaches only!    We also had an issue with the air conditioning! It was impossible to turn it off and we were in great pain as a result (we both got a sore throat).    They were ""cleaning"" the room every day and a strange thing was happening with the towels: they were taking them away in the morning and bringing them back in the afternoon. Very weird!

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Fiona F wrote a review Oct 2018,40,Relaxing & Lovely Place to stay,I stayed at hotel du golf from the 16th - 23rd of September. Overall my stay was very pleasant staff were very nice and helpful & not a bit lazy as I had read in previous reviews . We loved the room & decor & the A/C was brilliant and well needed given it was 35-38 degrees .    The breakfast is AMAZING and I had expected this from other reviews We only booked B&B so filled up on breakfast as much as possible . The choices are endless & loved the Moroccan tea being served at breakfast too .    There is a free shuttle bus service that drops you off to the old town which leaves the hotel at certain times and collects you at a certain spot near the big mosque which is very handy as a taxi would be approx €20.00    We used the Palm Spa Gym a few times during our stay which is great and has all the equipment you’d want .  The only negatives would be we found it a bit expensive for food & drink  basically same as irish prices. Also there was no entertainment at all during our stay which wasn’t great  I know it’s probably the quiet season but even someone playing some music would have been nice .    The main pool is great and we mostly had it to ourselves for the first few days which was brilliant .  Overall great place for a relaxing holiday to do nothing . Loved it !,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/212fifi
Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Malcolm S wrote a review Oct 2018,40,Excellent golf and fitness facilities. We were well looked after.,The Hotel du Golf is part of the large Palmeraie Resort on the northern outskirts of Marrakesh.  But for its palm trees it would pass for a complex instantly recognisable to European travellers or international conference attendees seeking sports and golf facilities.  These are indeed excellent and since this was the purpose of our visit not surprisingly we enjoyed ourselves very much!Especially its golf course and extensive practice areas.  There is no question that the hotel itself is very nice.  We were aware of some pretty negative reviews from Trip Adviser colleagues. This was not our experience although its 5 star billing is a wee bit overinflated.  That said we were well looked after and would return without hesitation if golf pool and gym stuff was our primary or major focus - as it often is!

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,michaelcL2713SN wrote a review Sep 2018,30,Mixed Feelings,"Hotel Du Golf is one of several hotels in the Palmeraie Resort on the outskirts of Marrakech. The resort also contains a number of restaurants some looked better than others a convention centre a large comprehensively equipped gym (7.00-22.00). There's also an indoor pool with a couple of spa baths. The pool area is uninviting and needs some indoor plants and wall decoration. The resort area looked tired. Hotel Du Golf itself looked very nice. There is a large open split level reception with a balcony as you enter. The lower level has a nice lounge/bar area. Check in was chaos. I didn't know at the time of booking that I would coincide with the World Salsa Congress. Fortunately I had asked for a quiet room away from the pool area which looked quite nice as were the grounds. My room itself was very nice indeed with a nice bathroom area. There is a decent sized balcony with comfortable seating overlooking the golf course. The bed was comfortable but the pillows a touch on the hard side. Unfortunately not everything was good (for a 5* hotel). There were no bath robes or slippers. No iron/board. The safe was a metal box in a sliding draw. Fine for passport & wallet useless for a DSLR camera. There was a kettle with coffee & sugar only. No tea or milk. If you want milk you call room service and they charge it to your account. A buffet breakfast was included in my plan (06.30-10.00). The space looked more like a converted function room than a dedicated restaurant there was a dance floor in the middle. It did not match the rest of the hotel. The floors were plain wood the tables were plain not even place mats. The buffet was neither elaborate nor extensive. The selection of cereals (mostly cornflakes and something else) was extremely disappointing. The fresh juices were very sweet. The egg station does a nice omelette.  The location of this resort is good and bad. Good for peace and quiet and bad for isolation! You are stuck to the resort and there is no ""popping out"" to another restaurant or even supermarket or shop unless you have a car or take a taxi. The resort is not cheap. Most of the staff I came into contact with were pleasant and helpful. Some not so. I had an issue in my room from day 2. When I returned I noticed ants crawling in the tray that contained the coffee sugar & cups. I also found them on my pillow. Upon closer inspection I found a trail of ants running from my balcony to my front door. 3 hours later after 2 phone calls and a visit to reception with a request to change rooms which was denied I had been given 3 promises than someone would come and spray. Nobody ever came and I realized they never would. They simply weren't interested. So I resigned myself to sharing my room with a colony of ants and walked carefully from then on because we all know what happens when you stand on one ant! There was also a serious problem with wasps outside near the pool grill.",Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelcL2713SN

We were really excited due to the good reviews. We arrived at 11pm absolutely knackered to be faced with the wonderful news at reception ""your room is cancelled we transfered you to another hotel"" no explanation given. My 1 year old boy was tired and so upset the receptionist didn't even think to offer us a seat to calm the wean or give him his bottle all he cared about is that our room is cancelled and he can do nothing for us. We were absolutely shocked the way we got treated or the way the hotel didn't bother to let us know by a simple email that our reservation is cancelled especially our reservation was in place 6months before not a last minute booking that they didn't have time. I would think twice before booking with this hotel.  For me I will never go back to this hotel even for free. I left one star due to tripadvisor minimum requirement in reality they deserve 0 star coz I didn't experience the hotel and due to their lack of customer service.

The worst: in a 5 star hotel you pay for a fast and efficient service and it is not possible that most of the time there is only one person at the reception in a really big hotel (I saw maximum 2) and time of waiting there take 5-10-15 minutes ...,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Acala Del Rio, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jbazan393

Generally the restaurants available on the complex were all good bar a complete service disaster at the Pan Asian where the food we had was good but after a catalogue of service issues we felt we needed to leave to make our point.

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Ron M wrote a review Nov 2017,40,"Luxury hotel, good value for money. Some shortfalls.","This is a large sprawling two storey resort hotel with 300 rooms situated next to a golf course and a luxury park called ""Nikki Beach"" (only open during high season) although of course there is no beach but plenty of pools and groovy St.Tropez style double sunbeds. It is situated 15 kilometers from the airport and about 10 kilometers from downtown Marrakech. Nearest supermarket 3km. I was pleasantly surprised that considering Morocco is a Muslim country there was an excellent selection of wines spirits and beers at the little nearby shopping centre. Well stocked supermarket open until 10pm although no sale of alcohol after 8pm.  The hotel is part of the Palmeraie Group and is conjoined with the Palmeraie Palace Hotel next door. Also 300 rooms somewhat more luxurious and more expensive than Hotel du Golf. Both hotels have a large footprint and it's not that easy to walk between the two properties if you want to visit the Spa or one of the many restaurants. However the Concierge will call up a Golf Buggy to transport you from one property to the other. I decided to try the hotel's Italian restaurant ""Pasta Cozy"" one evening and set off to walk there. After 20 minutes I was exhausted and called for a golf buggy. It must have been well over a mile from my room to the restaurant which is situated at the edge of the property.  All the rooms have a common design and layout all have a balcony/terrace and a huge free standing bath which is a design cross between a banana and a canoe. The ladies will love it!  My room was on the top (second) floor overlooking the beautiful large central pool. The only problem with this is that it also overlooked the children's pool which was very noisy with screaming children from 8am many days. Fortunately the hotel was not particularly busy whilst I was there so it was tolerable. However in high season I can imagine this could be a real problem if you don't like noisy kids.  My main complaint is that the hotel TV system is limited to Moroccan programming and US French and German news channels. There are no BBC or SKY channels and no movie channels whatsoever not even pay-per-view. In my view this is a big drawback for British guests.    Although WiFi is free throughout the hotel the signal is not strong enough in many rooms to allow speedy access to the Internet. I complained about this to the hotel and they were kind enough to upgrade me to a suite which included a WiFi signal booster. This was the only way I could access UK news and watch a movie on my laptop.    I would highly recommend this 4 star luxury hotel as I found it very good value for money. Friendly and efficient staff. Very clean excellent food and drink. I particularly liked the very pleasant fragrance electronically permeating throughout the common parts of the hotel and the fresh flowers placed in my room every couple of days.",Date of stay: October 2017,,"Lightwater, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronmH9361RW

The breakfast selection was not of international standard but adequate. The staff were nice and friendly but few spoke English. The children's facility was also adequate as it allows you to go into city and visit sites.  The hotel offers transportation into the city which was nice. My problem was that one didn't really tap into the vibe of the real Marrakesh but the touristy one. There is so much dancing hungry snakes and monkeys you can watch. The feeling that most of the people one wants to get money out of you and that becomes the foundation upon which they provide any service.We will not be going back to Marrakesh.Its a city designed to make money out of tourism and I do understand that but not for me.

The hotel has a very modern feel complimented with an interesting selection of contemporary decor.  Nice enough food free internet and pool facilities. Was able to have a couple of early morning runs around the golf course which was great!  Only thing letting this hotel down is the house keeping. My room was not vacuumed for the entire week I was there- so that bits and pieces that ended up on the carpet stayed there until my departure.

Reception was friendly but my experience was distance maybe due to language or whatever. Rooms are great and very well decorated all there what you need and expect. Breakfast is okay and has a broad selection but due to low occupation it was selective even more at the dinner buffet. The hotel was clean but has its areas of improvement my bath tub was leaking and the way to the restaurant was always wet and slippery.

Poor management.  At around 6pm we got in our room : water evacuation of the shower was blocked there was towel for one person only the sliding door to the balcony could'nt be closed the safe could'nt be opened ...

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,PGlover83 wrote a review Sep 2016,40,A nice out of the way hotel with great shuttle into the city,"We stayed here for a week and were looking for a relaxing holiday with the option for adventures or day trips. We booked through BA who organised a transfer from the airport which took about 25 minutes. The staff at the hotel are very friendly and polite and ensured we were checked in efficiently and carried our luggage for us.    The room was very big with plenty of space large comfy bed ample storage desk comfy chair and balcony which over looked a golf course. Only strange thing is the bathroom wall has large plastic ""blinds"" which blank off the space from the eyes but offer no audio coverage so I hope you are comfortable with your partner! On a few occasions the house cleaning didn't give us new towels but a phone call and a few minutes later new ones arrived.    The pools are very nice and again plenty of friendly staff about. It does however seem to take a while for drinks and for orders to arrive once ordered. Sometimes you need to wait for change to brought over took 45 minutes and I had to chase it up once! The pool is large and clean and the smaller ""fountain"" pool is nice to relax in.    Being far away from the city food options are limited but the on site dinner buffet restaurant is lovely with a wide variety of food on offer each day and very tasty! It starts at about 8pm and there was something different every night yum!    The hotel is actually part of a kind of holiday complex made up of other hotels and golf courses. There are other restaurants and a club near by 10 minute walk and also a bank and excursion booking office - these are all very useful! The excursion office will arrange for transfers to collect from the hotel. The hotel shuttle which runs to the city centre is amazing a safe and quick drop off. We were met by a guide who seemed to be working for the hotel for 200dr he made our journey through the markets and museums a much happier experience as he was an excellent guide.    All in all its a nice hotel if you want to relax far away from the intense city but still be able to get there.It is expensive though as you are isolated so be prepared!",Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Kent, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PGlover83
Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Nublet wrote a review Sep 2016,30,Missing the details for a true 4* hotel,All in all we had a great stay in Hotel Du Golf. The food was excellent and 90% of the staff very friendly and happy to help. There were a few details however which means we probably wouldn't go back. First of all there were always plates in the hall ways from other guests room service some of which stayed there for over 24 hours. Housekeeping didn't always replenish the tea and coffee one time I had a stain on the new sheets.    The pool boys were happy to help married women or those covered up but as two western female travellers we had to wait over 2 hours on the first day to get a towel each and then noticed they would help other guests (as stated above) with moving loungers but not us. We were dressed conservatively too!

It literally looked like paradise with the gardens and grounds. The staff were really friendly even though their English was not great they tried to be as responsive as they could be.  One negative point is housekeeping- they literally did not speak a word of English and did not clean our rooms when requested. On one ocassion i had to call reception to send someone to clean our bath tub- we waited almost 4 hours even though they kept saying someone is one their way. Eventually i found a cleaner in the corridor and begged them to come clean the bathtub. She did a quick 30 second scrub with just a sponge and soap no water (i had to rinse down the tub myself afterwards).  Apart from that everything else was perfect.

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,travelprincess2012 wrote a review Aug 2016,40,nice hotel and nice pool,we had stayed in an alternative hotel for the first week of our holiday (All Inclusive) and found the staff much friendlier there. most staff in hotel du golf are not friendly which was disappointing. if you do not like wasps do not eat outside at the snack bar. most days we would order food and eat insisde to avoid the swarms of wasps although i think wasps are part and parcel of holidaying on Marrakech  brekfast can be a bit of a nightmare in Hotel Du Golf unless you go before 9am. tables are dirty or none available bread etc runs out and then a mad dash to get some bread when stocks are replenished. only one lady making fried eggs and omlette for whole hotel so queue can get very long ( i waited one morning for almost 20mins by which time there was no bread left!!). juices are concentrated except at weekends when the hotel fills up with local guests and they serve proper orange juice. at weekends very difficult / impossible to get sunbeds unless you go down first thing in the morning.  overall a pleasant hotel but fanta/coke cans by the pool are 50dirham (almost €5 each) in the inside hotel bar (50m away) cans are 30dirham. i recommend you stock up on drinks and water before you arrive !!  food in the restaurants on site is nice. our favourite was the Asian they bring lots of complimentary appetisers. buffet/BBQ dinner in hotel is nice 300dirham per person and kids go free but the other restaurants and probably better value and better choice. Nikki beach nearby is very expensive. cocktails are 220diram each but nice to experience the ambience (no children allowed)  dj at the pool in the evening until approx 11 pm and then the same local musicians play until midnight ever night.,Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,Ireland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelprincess2012

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Agnes M wrote a review Jul 2016,50,An outstanding hotel with the most amazing staff,Hotel du Golf has got very extensive grounds where you just get spoilt for choice. The staff are very courteous and in particular we were helped by a very kind and professional lady who helped us to book all our excursions through the hotel. Insaf told us a lot about the hotel and we hadn't realised that it was actually a full resort. It has a Brazillian and Itslian restaurant plus two other restaurants which serve some very nice traditional delicacies and other goods.  The hotel boasts an indoor and outdoor pool with very beautiful seating areas. Insaf a very knowledgeable and pleasant member of staff enabled us to understand the interesting lighting system of the hotel. The hotel is Eco friendly and is interested in saving the environment . The lights are controlled and turn off automatically during the day and are back on in the evenings as needed. The dimmed lights that align the corridors give the hotel a very calming effect.  The hotel has a very spacious and well equipped gym which also has an outdoor area infront of it with chairs for sunbathing. The hotel lounges are so beautiful if anything more beautiful than they're presented on the website.  The hotel organises tours and we were very lucky that Insaf helped us book the most amazing excursions which included climbing the Atlas Mountains which was a very worthwhile though challenging experience with very strong water falls camel rides buggy tides in the desert and visits to the Berber villages where we bought authentic handmade carpets and argan oil and honey.  The food served by the hotel is very delicious and the buffet has so many varieties. I still miss the fresh juices. The service is excellent and we were given a special breakfast on our last day since we left before breakfast time. The staff are all very kind and friendly and thre is very good security which ensures one's safety.  We did not get enough of the hotel and we would love to visit again and enjoy the mint tea and the shisha a!! We had an amazing time and we'd recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a break away from a busy life as it's very calming with such beautiful and extensive gardens.,Date of stay: July 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/287agnesm

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Jasage87 wrote a review Jun 2016,10,Easily the worst customer experience for a 5 star.,"I stayed at the Hotel Du Golf for 4 nights with my partner. I booked a package with flights through Voyage Prive I was originally booked to stay at their sister hotel - the Palmeraie Palace but due to Ramadan we were moved to Hotel Du Golf.    Upon arriving despite the hotel being empty our room was not ready. The woman at the front desk spoke little to no English so was unable to effectively communicate what time it would be ready.    Throughout the stay the language barrier became an issue even asking staff basic questions like ""where is the bathroom"" ""what time is the shuttle pick up"" were either misunderstood or staff had to find another staff member to translate. On one instance we called ahead to double check the time of the shuttle and the woman at the front desk gave us the wrong time meaning we missed the shuttle.    The food was ok - lots of greasy fried food pasta bakes basic salads etc (I'd hate to think if you were GF/DF!) - and awfully repetitive ie. the same spread at breakfast and dinner. The lighting was also so dark at dinner you could not see what anything was.    The hotel lacked any sort of atmosphere. Sitting at dinner was depressing. A huge darkly lit space with about 5-8 staff standing around bad tv on in the background and about half a dozen guests. Despite the number of staff their lack of English which meant they couldn't develop any sort of rapport with customers nor could they be useful when you tried to ask them for things. The only time they had a smile was when they came over with the bill.    My biggest frustration however was not the hotel's compete lack of atmosphere poor English and the mediocre food but the lack of communication between staff members. Envisaging that it would be a long a painful check out given language barriers I thought ahead and decided to settle the bill the night before. During this i was served by a man at check out called Mohammed who was lovely and spoke very good English. He developed instant rapport and gave me more insight into the Moroccan culture than all elements of the hotel combined. He double checked what things were and made sure the bill was all correct. I left having a positive experience.    The next morning as we went to check out I handed over the keys the woman at the front desk (a different one!) told me that I owed them extra money for the lunch meals we had. Despite me having cleared this up the previous night and making it clear that through Voyage Prive we had negotiated a half board that included breakfast and lunch or dinner these costs were appearing on a new bill.    I then pulled up several confirmation emails one which cleared stated ""Thank you for your email - I have just checked the original offer details and it states that half board includes breakfast and either lunch or dinner. If you need anything else at all please do let me know"" when I showed the woman she proceeded to argue with me tell me that's not how it works when I tried to explain that we had been moved hotels her lack of English meant she could not understand. I then showed her several other confirmations stating the above and she continued to disagree with me. Struggling to read the English she then got a colleague who upon reading realized I was correct.    Instead of apology she was rude and reluctantly made the update.    I left feeling very frustrated and disappointed. But it did not stop there.  Upon getting home back to London I had half a dozen calls from the hotel saying i further owed them money from the dinner the night prior and ""it was a problem of posting."" (basically their systems hadn't updated which is not my problem!) I emailed them my card details and I'm still waiting for a confirmation and final bill.

The food was tasteless and restaurant staffs are not accommodating. I needed a chilli sauce to improve the taste of their useless dinner and I asked 4 different staffs and none came with my chilli.

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,_jtambwe wrote a review Jun 2016,20,Avoid this hotel at all costs.,The rooms are infested with cockroaches and little ants  staff treat you with disrespect.  food is rationed (booked halfboard) water and sugar is added to juices. At dinner time food is served in a dark environment is not labelled so you can't see well what you are eating.  If booking a hotel shuttle to town for shopping drivers take you to specific shops which are overpriced so they get paid commision by the shopkeepers.  I dont recommend this Hotel for anyone.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_jtambwe
Hotel Du Golf Rotana,417alvisea wrote a review Jun 2016,30,"Below expectations, not to be considered a 5 star Hotel",I have been 6 days at the Hotel du Golf between the end of May and the beginning of June for a Congress and a couple of extra-days of pleasure.    I chose the Hotel du Golf instead of the Palace because from the name I gave for granted it was the one closer to the Golf and where you can breath that golf-hotel vibes I like a lot: I was wrong. The Hotel du Golf is further to the club than the Palace hotel and there is no golfers crowd hangign around at all. It is a modern hotel with clean spacious rooms but that is it. No golf experience to look for in it.    Worst thing is the the food: the quality of the food is of a low 3 star hotel. Absolutely to avoid eating there any meal. All buffet are of very low quality food croissant almost plastic and dinner meals cold over cooked and really bad not worth a euro. DIrty tables sticky of honey and leftovers of previous guests zero service at tables incredibly disappointing.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Brussels, Belgium",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/417alvisea

At breakfast you see everyone getting waited on who can speak the language! If your English it's get it yourself or I'll get that for you and no body comes back with what you asked for sometimes they wait till you finished and then say oh you not want it disgusting behaviour if I'm honest!!  We have asked for towels a few times now and they say yes on the way sir 45 minutes later your still waiting you will call to see what is going on and they just pick up and then put down the phone if we didn't only have 2 days left we would 100% leave this hotel!...! On the other hand it's clean and the rooms are nice with a good pool area but all that for me is ruined by the horrendous treatment and service they provide!!!,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChiefKurtis
Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Thanhle70 wrote a review May 2016,40,A must place to return to,A great hotel to stay for your time in Marrakesh. Was here for a two days conference and did not want to leave the hotel. Arranged pick-up from the airport was there and the trip to the hotel was smooth. Checked in was efficient. The view from my room overlooking the pool was lovely. Room was spacious with comfortable feel to it making you instantly feel at ease. The balcony had deck chairs to sit and see the sun rise/set something not all hotel have. Wifi was excellent. The bathroom had an interesting design I would have liked more space around the basin to store toiletries.    Breakfast was the usual spread of international buffet. The quality of the service was disappointing. Tables were set up for large groups and not many for 1-2 quite breakfast meeting. Every morning I had to ask for table setting as the table was not refreshed you have to go get your own coffee if you got a cup!    The fitness facility and the pool was top class this made my stay much more relaxing and enjoyable. Although would have preferred the fitness facility to open earlier than 7 am.    Nice bar/lounge area that had a good DJ mixing music not bad to sit relax and have 1-2 drinks with colleagues.    The garden and grounds were very well maintained.    The hotel offered a shuttle bus service to the Medina and returned this is great since the hotel is about 20 mins drive from the main part of town. Although the return shuttle end of 18:30 so if you wanted to have dinner and see the square at night you need to negotiate the taxi ride back.    Overall a good stay.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Canberra, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thanhle70
Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Alexis F wrote a review May 2016,10,Nothing nice to say about this hotel,I recently stayed here for a work conference and had the worst experience. My first room was invested with ants. It took several calls to get someone to come down to the room to see the sea of ants taking over my bathroom. They were incredibly unhelpful in cleaning them up and getting me another room. Finally I was able to move rooms and they placed me in a room that the AC didn't work. 100 degrees and no air conditioning is unacceptable. Again called and they said they would send a tech...of course no one came. I finally secured a room at the palace hotel in the same resort and had to call the front desk three times to have someone help me move rooms again. Common theme customer service is not a priority in this hotel and no concern for fixing unacceptable rooming conditions. Additionally several other conference attendees had to be moved as well...how they are considered five stars is beyond me!,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled on business,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/478alexisf

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,PathaniKurri wrote a review Apr 2016,50,Family Holiday,We have returned from the hotel on 26th March 2016. We had a brilliant time with the five of us. No one wanted to leave! This was our first visit to Marrakech and I would definitely say that all the staff from the reception people to the breakfast bar to hotel keeping (especially Rachid who would visit our room every day and ask how we were such a delightful man) and welcoming staff at the door made our trip the most memorable.We were given a double room rather than a triple when we arrived but still the staff went out of the way to change our rooms and gave them next to each other near the reception. Cleanliness was A+. Our rooms were cleaned to an excellent standard every single day the maid done a fantastic job of making sure our room was spotless The staff would always be smiley and ask us how we were would visit our room just to see if we was comfortable as my family became a little ill. The staff are just so polite and nice even down to the security guys ...absolute credit to the management. A special thanks to the reception for dealing with any enquiries for us quickly and efficiently who welcomed us so much and made the process so easy especially Rim Ozlem and Hicham. Free wifi in all rooms which works amazing from the full length of the hotel.    Hotel amenities and location absolutely fantastic and away from the hustle bustle of the Medina. Nothing was too much trouble as there was a taxi rank outside and a complimentary shuttle running 4 times a day to Medina and Gueliz. Very attentive staff. All excursions booked were of highest quality and great value and were explained in great detail to us by Ozlem . The Nikki Beach is also at walking distance.  The breakfast served in the restaurant offered something for everyone and was excellent serving a range of food. The breakfast staff were always welcoming every morning and went out of their way to serve us in the best way possible and would always come for a chat especially Razine Housseine Abdessmad and Berkan Hanane and the manager. Apologies if I have forgotten any names. Would be a great start to the day with their compliments  Can't wait to return. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel as not only is it situated in an ideal position it is well run and the rooms are fantastic.  Thanks for making our stay perfect!!!!

On site restaurants are good. The shuttle running to the city was excellent - always a few minutes late to leave but always on time to pick you up.    WiFi was consistently good. Room was nice and the balcony was great.    The bathtub with the shower wasn't perfect as shower curtain didn't reach all the way around so I had to constantly mop up the floor.

The golf course was interesting as well. The hotel has also different restaurants and a free shuttle service that can take one to the medina since the hotel is a little far away from the city. Amazing spa treatments and cannot forget to mention Ms khaoula from the shop the sweetest.

Mr amri said was also very helpful with shuttle and such a gentleman. All the staff were very friendly and welcoming. The pool was a little cold. However this could be because of the season we went on. The pool at the palmerie palace is lovely and room service food is much better than food from the medina. I would recommend staying here 100%.

We were luckily given this holiday as a gift and everything was just wonderful! The hotel staff were all fantastical and from the minute we arrived we felt comfortable. It was a lovely gesture to give us all a drink upon arrival!    Our room was lovely and perfect for our little family (daughter of 11 and son of 4 who shared a double). It was ground floor pool side which could not have been more perfect! Our entire holiday revolved around that incredible pool!    I loved that the hotel sent me a delicious birthday mousse cake - it really was a special touch!    The buffet breakfast was really good - so much variety. I loved that they had vegetable juices!!! We really enjoyed our breakfasts    On a whole we were very happy here however the only thing I'd like to comment on that lost a star for us was the food as in a bit more variety and more Moroccan cuisine and perhaps possibly a few more choices although thinking back perhaps it was cost for us every day as we just couldn't afford expensive lunches aswell as dinners. Maybe having local traditional cheaper dishes may have been something to consider (cous cous and vegetables etc). I don't know I think I cannot truly complain - I can only ask that the pool side menu perhaps get relooked at. Maybe alternate certain dishes on different days (for those whose stay at the hotel all day)    Overall we would most definitely stay here again if we ever did get have to go to Marrakesh again.

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,BorisPorter62 wrote a review Dec 2015,50,Loved my stay,Part of a group of twelve golfers on our second trip to Marrakech. This was so much better than our hotel of the previous year even if the 'all-inclusive' only appeared to be so from 7.30 - 11 each evening. The hotel is part of a spa complex with a big pool and a golf course literally at the end of the patio. Rooms were spacious and well-equipped and the meals were varied with a substantial selection to be enjoyed. Both the beer and the wines that were part of the deal were perfectly drinkable and overall it was a most civilized few days with wonderful hospitality. A definite recommend for golfers and general tourists alike,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Farnborough, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BorisPorter62

The hotel room was really clean and the food was good. The breakfast was similar to something I see in USA(you know bread ham bacon fruits etc). It had various kinds of each and they were all delicious. They also had room service which was very convenient when I got hungry late at night. They had a bar where I enjoyed some Moroccan beer with my friends. The facility was overall fantastic. It has a swimming pool and golf course.  A lot of the workers there speak some English and you can always find someone who speaks very fluent English easily. Also the hotel has a souvenir store which has a wide selection of Moroccan accessories candles postcards and so on. Khaoula the cashier at souvenir store also speaks very good English gave me some suggestions to help me find souvenirs for myself and my family.

The room and facilities were excellent. In short we had a great time relaxing around the pool and hunting for bargains in the souk.    However as we were leaving we were a bit apprehensive at the amount of security.

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,chrisjc85 wrote a review Oct 2015,50,What an incredible experience!,Let me start by saying that I don't normally write reviews but this hotel defintely deserves one. My girlfriend and I arrived late in the evening and we were totally exhausted. We just showed up to this hotel not knowing what to expect at all. We tend to improvise and we don't plan ahead hardly ever but we ended up here randomly as we needed a little break from the hostels and not much else was available when we arrived. The hotel is a bit far from the city center but the shuttle bus is only a short ride if that's where you're going so it's no big deal. But listen dudes and dudettes let me tell you - the room itself and the FOOD were both fantastic. On the second night we decided to take a dip in the pool just to unwind and relax - and it was a VERY nice environment - very clean. The staff was also helpful - especially employees Imad anddd... Abderahim I believe were their names. They were helpful to us from the beginning to the very end of our stay... anything we needed they accomodated us - especially the FOOD... omg delicious and promptly served. Exceptional service. No doubt I would stay here again. Hopefully with the same awesome employees too. They were really what made it. To whomever comes here in the future... no worries and peace be with you.

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Babelfish84 wrote a review Oct 2015,40,"Lovely hotel, fantastic rooms, great breakfast",Was here on a corporate trip and stayed for 2 nights.    The check in was great despite a large group it was swift and friendly. My room was as far away from reception as possible and sadly my room key didn't work so it was a bit of a trek back but luckily the second time it worked.    Very comfortable bed clean room and some fruit on a platter. Balcony included sun loungers which was nice.    Bathroom was lovely as well - spacious and the toiletries were good.    Few minor niggles :    Shower had no door - this meant it was quite cold and water went everywhere.  I turned the aircon off when leaving the room as I found it too cold but when I got back turn down service had arrived and had turned it back on again - so instead of the warmer room I'd hoped for it was back to cold!    Breakfast was amazing - so much choice of food freshly squeezed juices catering to every taste and a fresh omelette station which was delicious. All staff were friendly and efficient.    Pool was great only got there towards the end of the afternoon but plenty of sun loungers and towels available.    This was only a very short trip but would happily stay here again.

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Annabelle J wrote a review Sep 2015,40,"Luxurious hotel, beautiful setting, poor service",The hotel has beautiful rooms with very comfortable beds and a quiet balcony. It also has a lovely pool which suffices to make it a worthwhile destination.    However the bar & restaurants in the complex are all at European (or higher!) prices and not the widest selection on offer. Moreover the service is very slow. We had to remind our server of our orange juice order twice with 1.5 hours from initial order to payment. We also ordered food by the pool and waited about 2 hours (with a few reminders) to be served. Breakfast was a buffet nightmare with the food disappearing very quickly and not being replenished. At the appointed end of breakfast the servers simply started taking what little was left away (including things like milk for coffee) which seemed a little ridiculous!    Having said that the staff were always friendly and smiley and didn't mind being gently coaxed and cajoled into hurrying up. They were also very apologetic for any confusion and delays.    If you are happy to sit in the sun and wait for things to line up nicely you will love this place (as I did). If you mind paying European prices and waiting for things you may be less frustrated staying elsewhere!,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/374annabellej

Lovely room overlooking the golf course. AC not very cool but it was 41 degrees outside maybe the management should look into this issue as we did move rooms after 1 night but wasn't any cooler.

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Farhana2423 wrote a review Jun 2015,50,"Beautiful hotel, amazing service, wonderful surroundings.",Visited this hotel in June for a week it was our first time in Morocco and we had the most amazing time had a lovely welcome from the hotel staff when we arrived a nice flannel rose scented to cool us down and an ice cold tropical juice to drink whilst our room was made ready for us. A friendly member of staff gave us a tour of the hotel before we went to our room. The suite was absolutley stunning just what we expected the decor is so modern and we had a beautiful view of the golf course from our terrace balcony. There were fresh roses in our room which was a nice touch. We were welcomed with a little platter of moroccan sweets and complimentary bottles of water which was just what we needed. The housekeeping and room service staff were very attentive anything you needed they got it for you within 10 minutes. They cleaned the room to perfection everyday when we went out with fresh towels and linen. We ate at the restaurant twice during our stay and the buffet menu was delicious a very big variety as it was Ramadhan and we were both fasting the food was just how we wanted it. The restaurant staff were amazing and very friendly. We ordered room service many times and the food was perfect and we recieved it in a reasonable timescale. The pool and lounge area is really pretty we spent many evenings relaxing there and looking at the beautiful scenery and stars at night. Overall we had an amazing week at hotel du golf. I recommend this 5 star hotel spa and golf resort to everybody if you want to live in luxury whilst being in Marrakech then this is the hotel to be in. The staff are very very friendly warm and welcoming they will help you with every need and are very attentive. We even went on a tour of Marrakech with the hotels car service the driver was lovely with amazing english and showed us every historical site we wanted to see and let us visit each one whilst he waited outside. It was the perfect way to see Marrakech. Thet also do other excursions too. We were sad to leave at the end of our stay but we will definatley be going back to Marrakech hopefully next year and we will definatley stay at Hotel Du Golf again. It was more than a five star experience.,Date of stay: June 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Farhana2423

Insaf at the front desk was very attentive helpful and has a most charming smile. The hotel was very clean and has a nice pool that was a bit cool in April. I had breakfast every morning at the hotel restaurant and several workers went out of their way to make sure my food was served quickly and my coffee was hot. The workers there seem to genuinely take their service to heart - not just waiting for a better job. The manager stepped in to help me when I had a language difficulty getting my clothes to the launderer. A little French will go a long way if a worker doesn't know English.

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,l_dalby wrote a review Jun 2015,30,"Nice rooms and pool, but some staff let the place down",We visited Hotel Du Golf at the end of May for a long weekend and were generally happy with our visit but it was nothing out of the ordinary.    On arrival the hotel entrance is grand and well kept but straight away we were left waiting a long time at the check in desk and no welcome was really given to us we were silently presented with a form to fill in each (but only one pen) and that was the extent of the welcome. When we were finally checked in one of the bell hops guided us to our room (6227) which was on the second floor. The room was nice and well appointed with a giant bed and selection of pillows. Wifi was free and fast. After having a shower which is located above a bath I realised that it wasn't the best design with lots of water finding it's way onto the floor behind the bath. The shower head would also not stay high enough and kept slipping down the shower head pole (although this only occurred on one occasion).    The hotel was very quiet which was good during the day by the pool with loads of free loungers as well as peace and quiet to relax although it was a bit eery on the night of our arrival. We wanted some food but other than room service the only food available was a buffet. We ventured out into the resort and after a short walk found a french style restaurant which did the job.    Breakfast was good with a wide variety served until 1030. The selection was getting limited nearer the end of service but we generally found something we wanted. Mineral water was a hard thing to come by at breakfast with only one small bottle available and many times we had to ask numerous times for more to be provided. For whatever reason they seemed to be a bit against providing water! Food by the pool was good and reasonable value and we ate here a number of times. Service was good.    The hotel is located well out of town but they provide a shuttle service into town which was good. Taxi's back cost 150 MAD. We found this good as we wanted to mainly relax by the pool with the ability to see a bit of Marrakech too.    Overall I would recommend this hotel but the staff at breakfast and on the front desk had a very unhelpful attitude which stopped it from getting a 4 star rating.,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Croydon, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/l_dalby
Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Mark_Ascot wrote a review Jun 2015,40,"Great Hotel & Value, let down by service",My wife and I wanted a weeks golfing break with some interesting site seeing/dining etc on hand. Marrakech seemed to fit the bill. We got a flights and hotel package with BA which was truly excellent value. The hotel is as you see in the pictures on Trip Advisor. Great layout modern & funky with loads of space. It's connected to The Palmerie Palace Hotel and Golf Club. This means the Gym Spa multiple restaurants and bars night clubs golf are all walking distance and you have access to everything. There's a shuttle around the resort too. They need to watch the quality of the maintenance few signs of corners being cut and wear and tear being ignored. I think it links into my notes about the service culture issues below.    Golf course was pretty good and a round with clubs and buggy was £80/person. Don't expect a Top 100 course with beautiful views of Snow Capped Atlas Mountains as a few photos might appear. That's a pro photographer with a 600mm lens. It's a solid round of holiday golf.    Whilst we were there the hotel was almost empty for some reason. Suited us. Pick of sun bed table tee-time etc. But very quiet and lacking any holiday buzz at the bar.    Service in the hotel is very mixed. There is a bit of a language issue I think with Arabic & French. But that said they could really do with some new managers that would get staff focused on serving guests rather than chatting/texting and fixing stuff. I had to complain several times about wrong orders drinks taking 30 mins forgotten orders etc. Given the place was so empty it was really bad and a million miles from somewhere like the Four Seasons. Staff themselves were nice enough but they will get a really bad reputation if they don't pull their socks up.    Marrakech is an experience and not for the faint hearted. We've travelled a fair amount but never experienced a place where it seems absolutely everyone is trying to rip you off of a few bucks at every opportunity. Taxi unofficial guides every store you glance into. It's relentless and because the Medena area is such an incredible maze of tiny streets it's almost impossible not to appear like the lost tourist. My advice would be:  1) First visit have a guided tour arranged by your hotel.  2) Budget £50 in small notes to oil the wheels and get shot of people. They are so persistent the only other way is shouting/aggression and that's stressful.  All this said it's an amazing place and with a bit of planning will be a great experience.    Highlight of our trip was our 3 Valley Tour to the Atlas Mountain. Walked up cascades to a beautiful waterfall and ate Tagine in a Berber village.

This was all to hand at the hotel. The room overlooked the golf course and the balcony had sun in the afternoon. My room was very clean well equipped and the bed was so so comfortable!  The free shuttle bus into Marrakech runs 4 or 5 times a day and as I was on my own the driver was aware to look out for me at the pick up point in Marrakech. On organising trips the reception staff were very helpful and friendly - thank you Hayat and Safia!  The dining room was fine but I would suggest that greater attention should be paid to the cleanliness of the floor - particularly at breakfast. The breakfast choice was excellent although the evening meals were a little disappointing and the choice did not vary very much.  The lounge/bar area is beautiful luxury with comfort. On 2 of the evenings there was a saxophonist playing and he was extremely talented.  I found all the staff to be attentive and friendly - particularly on Reception as mentioned previously and also the porters. In other areas I found that if I was pleasant and made the effort then so did the staff.  If visiting Marrakech again then I would definitely stay at the Hotel du Golf.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Droxford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Di5ey

Breakfast was good wide selection of hot and cold buffet but otherwise food at this hotel was a disaster !!!  Evening menu in hotel was a buffet salad various meats and veg desserts all of which was very poor quality cold and overpriced.  There is a number of other restaurants in the resort we tried Cosy Pasta Brazilian Dinner & Show Amedus none of which impressed me all over priced !  Dinner with one drink each will set you back approx €80.00 Pool side burger/ sandwich with a coffee for two will cost approx €35.00.  Outdoor pool area was lovely lots of different seating options but the pool water was freezing so swimming not a option  The shuttle bus only runs a couple time a day with the last bus returning at 18.30pm and with a taxi costing €20.00 from Marrakech to hotel it limits any other options for dining  Biggest disappointment was the Spa it was disgusting Pool area was old mouldy broken tiles changing area was shabby and spa staff rude and pushy  I was so disappointed as I had look at so many resorts all around the same price range and choose this hotel after reading reviews wish I hadn't.,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Kilkenny, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wpttb

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Spiritua wrote a review Jan 2015,40,Good hotel for golfer,Stayed one week in the Hotel du Golf with purpose of playing golf on their course. Room was fairly sized with a balcony. Great bed and modern bathroom. Furniture in room in good shape and quality.  Hotel is well maintained staff friendly and buffet in the morning absolutely fine (large choice including cooks for eggs and pancakes).  The main reasons of the stay was golfing. You need to take a free shuttle 5 minutes from hotel (or walk 10 minutes) to reach club-house and practice. The practice is very good with unlimited driving range balls very well maintained short game and putting green.  The course itself is good. Nothing great nothing bad. You get nicergolf course about 20 minutes away but price will go up significantly as well (550 MAD in hotel du golf against others around 700-900 MAD). Caddy mandatory but always had a good experience !  Overall very good value for money. Hotel was good golf course was good.

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Corben104 wrote a review Jan 2015,20,Below standard,Hotel du golf was far below expectations. We arrived early and tried to check in but our rooms were not ready. So we went for breakfast. Even though we had not checked in yet the staff kindly allowed us to get in. Realizing that this first breakfast was not included in our package the restaurant manager started chasing us one by one to secure his 15 Euros in cash which we of course were willing to pay. But instead of putting it on our future rooms and settle this later we were treated like thieves!    Later we got our rooms. In the booking it was agreed we would have rooms with view on the golf or the swimming pool. No need to mention we got a room on the street. We didn't fight it because this was supposed to be a holiday weekend we already lost too much time with the check in.    Then decided to go to town with the complimentary mini bus. The 15 seaters mini bus was nearly full when arriving. They share it with the hotel next door (the palmeraie golf palace). No alternative was given but to take a taxi the hotel would not organize an additonal service. Fort the next days we went to the Palmeraie to be sure to have a seat.    The rooms are nice large enough and comfortable. The bathroom is another story! The shower has no door and no curtain so there is water everywhere. The shower rail was broker and it was not possible to block it in the middle or top if the rail so I asked for it to be fixed when leaving in the morning. Of course it was not fixed on the evening so we continued using it the best we could spilling water everywhere.    Dogs are apparently admitted as we could find one bothering us just next to the outdoor swimming pool...    For the indoor swimming pool spa and sauna it takes place at the Palmeraie palace next door. The changing room looks like one from the eighties that has never been refurbished. The staff gives you a towel... if there are enough remaining! For the slippers you have to ask. Bathrobe are not provided so you have to come with your own from your room.    On the positive side the breakfast buffet has a lot of choice and the dinning room very large.    The service has always been good and the staff helpful and very kind and polite doing as much as they could.    Unfortunately the management is far less competent than their subordinates.,Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Luxembourg City, Luxembourg",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Corben104

I booked this beautiful hotel about ten days before. I read some of the trip advisor comments and was a bit hesitent because of a few bad reviews. But how wrong the were when we arrived. There was a mix up with my booking and I had only booked a suite for one person which was my fault but we we arrived were moved to a double twin room as I was staying with my friend to relax for five days. We used the fantastic well equipped gym everyday the outside pool as well daily.  Food was exemplary and lots of choices with the hotel next door which is part of this complex.

My business partner suggested to stay in Hotel Du Golf based on his previous experience with other hotels in Marrakech. He found Du Golf hotel the best in staff's services which i experienced myself during my stay.    Morocco for an Indian to visit for the first time was quite a task. But the time spent in hotel was worth the money spent. I am a pure Vegetarian which was my only main concern. Miss Reem working as Guest Relation manager took care of the vegetarian food throughout the stay. We were very particular on no egg and no meat in our meals. The same was noted by Reem and we were completely satisfied with the food. Reem carries a friendly and caring nature.    We appreciate her understanding about our concern of pure vegetarian food.

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,GillesMercier wrote a review Nov 2014,50,Fantastic Experience in Marrakech,My wife and I were in Marrakech for a conference earlier this month. The booking agency had messed up our reservations but the personnel at Hotel du Golf were exceptional. We were particularly impressed with the customer service offered by Hayat Toumani and her manager Mr. Slim who quickly found a solution to our dilemma. We had a fantastic room pool side and the hotel staff at every turn was pleasant and accommodating. Special mention to their door man Med Soulala for excellent service as well. We were able to play some golf while on the property and the golf course itself is world-class although I strongly recommend that Hayat and Mr. Slim be in charge of customer service at the golf course as well !!!,Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Nashville, Tennessee",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GillesMercier

When I was going inside this hotel I saw one girl who work there her name is Hasna Boumahdi. She helped me to found room and all things I needed inside. She was very good with me. and all services inside this hotel are excellent. She talked to me khaleeji.So I can understand She was very nice.  i really enjoyed my travel.

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,SQgolfer wrote a review Nov 2014,20,Not worth it,Pathetic.  I had made a reservation at the Palmeraie Golf Palace Hotel a month before and due to overbooking (a mistake by the Hotel reservation team) the Hotel Management took the liberty to change my reservation to Hotel du Golf five days before my trip! After much protest they apologized but said that nothing could be done. So much for customer service it's awful all the way.  The rooms are clean and most of them come with a nice view of the golf course the courtyard or the swimming pool. The bed is comfortable and linen is clean and warm. The room is spacious and can accommodate three people or a family of four (2 small children). There is also free internet (wifi) in the rooms. Bathrooms are small and amenities are below standard. There is a coffee maker in the room with coffee and tea but no milk. Two water bottles are provided the first day and additional bottles come at aprice of €2 per bottle.  The hotel has a pool but no gym. If you want to work out then one has to go to the gym in the Golf Palace Hotel which is a ten minute walk. There are no hotel shops and only one restaurant which serves buffet food (nothing great). The hotel is also located about twenty minutes from the city center; although there are free shuttle buses that take you there and back the schedule may not be to your liking. Taxis cost about €10 to get to town.

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,SusanG99 wrote a review Oct 2014,30,Not quite what we expected!!!,I have taken some time to write this review as it's been rattling around in my head since our visit in August (2014) and I needed some time to reflect. All of the points I am about to make have been personally discussed with the duty manager of the day when we checked out. When asked 'How was your stay' we felt it only right to tell it how we had found it. I felt like a 'Secret shopper'. This is a beautiful hotel and has the appearance of a newly refurbished high end establishment. Lush surroundings on a golf course in a new development of high end hotels. Beautiful modern rooms with a very comfortable bed one of the best we have ever slept in. The room was very clean and the bathroom was quirky and fun. Tea and coffee facilities. A free shuttle bus takes you to all the other hotels to use their restaurants or the independent restaurants along the main strip. We had a fantastic entertaining evening with fab food in the Brazilian restaurant next door one night and really good Sushi the following evening. On the last night we ventured a little further (by free bus) to the really lovely Italian and the food was great.  So that is all the positives....................  During August the temperature averages at 40 C on arrival there was complimentary bottled water in our room during our 5 day stay we never saw another bottle either complimentary or to buy. Our mini bar was completely empty and never filled.  Breakfast was complete chaos tables were never cleared and you had to wait to sit down and clear it yourselves. The breakfast manager looked like he was going to have a complete breakdown and I dared not ask for plates when there weren't any a simple requirement. The food was ok and plentiful a station for pancakes and eggs or omelettes. One morning a guy appeared and was squeezing fresh orange juice on a 'push down' hand operated juicer the queue was around the restaurant and not even an option to join.  The pool area was packed and the obligatory towels on beds occurred early in the morning. Not a problem for us as sitting around the area around the pool involved being subject to loud pumping disco music all day!! To the left of this area was a quiet area with comfy double sunbeds and lovely tables and chairs and small fountains. This suited us fine. Unfortunately on 2 mornings the pool towels had run out by 10am. A trip back at 11am and the second delivery had also dried up (excuse the pun)!  The pool bar was severely understaffed and you could only feel sorry for the poor blokes on duty. Grabbing their attention was an art in itself but half an hour for a coke was just a joke. Sorry we have no ice madame what!!!!!  The swimming pool itself is grubby with broken decking and bare nails. The water was full of hair and it could be seen floating on the top!    This hotel needs some good management putting in place and should not expect that the plush surroundings will disguise the terrible levels of service.    I would happily return to help sort out the problems here but would skip breakfast!!!!,Date of stay: August 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Berkhamsted, Herts",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusanG99
Hotel Du Golf Rotana,annesophie900 wrote a review Oct 2014,30,A nice hotel but very poor service,Although most of the time friendly the staff has obvisouly absolutely no idea what they're doing. We've ordered a breakfast and had roughly half of our order some missing and some wrong and had to argue (!) to get what we were paying for (which we didn't anyway). The exact same story happened at the spa where I had to argue again to get the massage I was paying for instead of the basic black soap hammam. I eventually managed to get half of my massage. When I complained the spa desk simply chose to ignore me and I had to wait for a polite customer to tell the lady that I was there before. They finally offered me a massage for the next day which of course I didn't accept (I wasn't going to spend the whole weekend in this spa).  To sum it up the building are nice but next time I'll add 1000dh and go to the Essaadi Palace for a real 5 star / palace service quality.,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Paris, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annesophie900
Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Saad Abid wrote a review Sep 2014,50,Everything you need in one place,First of all you have to make sure that you reserve at the new hotel du Golf and not the Palmeraie Golf Palace. Since it's the same company sometimes you might make a mistake.  What i loved about this hotel is that it's new the rooms are nice the design very modern. I loved the furnitures because you can feel that there is a same pattern that you can find in all the hotel even in the lobby restaurant and of course the rooms.  The staff is nice welcoming and very helpful. I was there for a 3 day conference and everyhting went well.  Now the thing that i loved the most is that the complex has everything that someone might need in a walking distance. From gym to golf to nightclub to restaurant to tapas bar ...I run a lot and there is a good track in the golf.

It has a very impressive outlook and very clean and spacious roomsalso very high standard lounge and seating area for guests.very friendly and reliable service. we had breakfast there it was buffet type. We went out for lunch and dinner and benefitted from their own shuttle bus which was convenient and suited for our needs. Bus driver was frindly and was able to suggest places to visit. Only thing which could improve this service if the shuttle bus had few more pick up and drop off points from more than two location. It has a amazing garden and a beautiful pool surrounded by gorgeous palm trees. My kids loves to swim really enjoyed their outdoor swimming pool.

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,JacqBMiddlesbrough wrote a review Jun 2014,30,Experience not a expected,I stayed for a conference for 4 nights. The only reason I give upgraded my score to an average score was because the wifi in the room was excellent and the staff on reception were very nice if it wasnt for this it would have got a poor. The bathtub with shower curtain around made showering not very refreshing poor water flow and water everywhere. No soap holder at the sink and hard towels. Bed was comfortable and plenty of space to hang your clothes room wasnt anything special. Service went down hill in the restaurant getting attention to order a drink waiting forever for it to arrive thats if you got what you ordered and no explanation of how the buffet worked the first night they seated me so I could only see the salad selection When I said is this all that is on offer tonight they said yes 300MAD very expensive. When I askedd for butter they said they did not have any yet they had butter at breakfast! I dont think they could be bothered. I had no idea there was a cooking station on the other side of the restaurant. Although I dont think it was open as there were only 4 people in the restaurant. Fly's on the food. Lunch was better and no flys! but we saw the staff taking our drinks we prepaid and hiding them behind the counter even though we didnt order wine there were wine glasses on the table and not the coffee cups we would expect in fact when I did ask where the coffee was it arrived just as we had to leave! The pool looked refreshing but I wouldnt want to stay here on holiday its just overrun with conferences. I ordered an english tea they asked if I wanted milk which I said yes what came was a tea bag on a plate and a teapot full of hot milk. The conference staff let our team down but I am trying to review the hotel and the facilties fairly. Drinks and food is expensive in this hotel so I would expect better service and understanding of European standards if this were to improve them certainly it would be worth trying. For a conference certainly never again.,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Middlesbrough, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JacqBMiddlesbrough

The AC worked fine and all equipments were in good working conditions. The hotel is quite which was what we needed for a relaxing week-end. The breakfast buffet was fantastic ! It is too bad that all restaurants are located in the Palmerai Golf Palace next door. The golf course was OK and not too crowded but no discount on the green fee was offered to hotel residents which what one might expect by staying there. A small practical suggestion is to post direction signs for the hotel at the entrance from the road from Casablanca which would avoid the hassle of having to stop and ask people for directions.,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Washington Dc, District Of Columbia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AbdelJ312

If you have decided to stay in the palmerie (for golf or resort) this is an OK/value for money option. The hotel is newly built has high standard and really big nice rooms with lounge areas double bathrooms etc. The poolarea is also very nice. Overall a nice resort hotel. What it lacks is personality and service. Its a huge complex and I prefer the nicer smaller riads or more upscale luxuary hotels when staying in Marrakech.

When I arrived home I realised that I had left my favorite shirt hanging in the cupboard in my room. I emailed the hotel to ask if they could save my shirt and pass it to a colleague staying at the hotel. However the hotel didn't respond to multiple emails nor telephone calls. Once the hotel has taken your money and you have left obviously they care nothing for service.

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Missy J wrote a review Mar 2014,50,Amazing stay in this African paradise,Getting there & Check in  We got to the hotel by taxi from the airport and it cost us 150 dirhams about £12. We were met by the bell boy/porter who welcomed us and carried our suitcases into the lobby. We were asked to sit down and fill in some forms. They asked for my bank card and they said it was just for guarantee. The receptionists were ok I saw faint smiles here and there. I think the staff are quite nice when you get to know them they just have difficulty communicating fluently in English so they are hesitant to make conversations .  The receptionist explained breakfast times and pointed us to where the spa and fitness room were. I asked about the Internet and shuttle and she showed me the hours that the bus comes. Someone carried our luggage to our room and then showed us where everything was in the room. When we tried to give him a tip he said no it was ok he was just doing his job. Amazing to get service without the expectation of a tip.    The Room  When we got to our room we were stunned by how beautiful it was. Our room was the standard room but quite stunning with very modern decor and amenities. There was an LCD tv with what I think was some kind of cable..lots of channels inc CNN MTV Max movie channel Bloomberg MBC1-4 and others in French and Arabic.  The bathroom had a lovely oval shaped bathtub with shower option and toilet with a sliding door. There was a balcony overlooking the golf course and mountains Tea and coffee facilities but no milk. Hairdryer sep toilet .  The only downside was that there was barely any wifi signal in our room maybe because it was at the back. We mentioned at reception and they said they would send someone the next day to look into it. The person never came but we would once in a while get two bars of wifi that came for a few mnutes and disappeared for hours.    Food & Dining and Service from Staff  We went to the restaurant on one night for dinner. It was a buffet nothing special. 280 Dirhams per person. Several meat dishes including chicken lamb fish pasta rice salads etc  Breakfast is varied with plenty of cooked and continental food available. They also make pancakes and omelettes while you wait.  They have Moroccan and English tea but no herbal or green tea unfortunately which I love. They do have the Moroccan mint tea which is ok.  The staff speak French mostly but some can speak a bit of English. Contrary to what other reviewers said the staff were quite helpful and very friendly towards us and we can barely string a sentence in French.  Every evening they came to our room about 7pm to ask if we were ok if we needed any towels pillows teas etc  We used room service for dinner twice and it was good value and food was tasty. Much better value than buffet if you want a la carte.    Hotel and Services  The Lobby and outside pool area is stunning at night. Lots of lights and lit up fountains.  Beautiful pool area shame the weather wasn't great during our visit so we didn't make use of this lovely area. The indoor pool which is located in another sister hotel down the road was a bit far for us to bother with. There is a shop were you can get drinks snacks like biscuits sweets etc which other reviews said was 5-10 mins away...it's quite far more like 18-20 mins brisk walk.  There was a conference on the day we arrived thankfully it finished the next day.  Hotel was quiet close to empty and very clean.  After reading other reviews we were worried about the shuttle but it came on time everyday and picked us up in the afternoons without any hassle much to our relief.  Times  Town to Hotel  9.30  11.30  14.30  16.30  1800    Town to Hotel  10.30  12.30  15.30  17.30  18.30    Visiting the Town Centre  We went to the old town medina.  Personally I think the Medina is overrated. It's dirty and full of shopkeepers battling each other to lure you into their small shops and entice you to buy things.  However you can see Moroccan people in a more natural environment and get souvenirs Aegean oil spices incense etc  You can also be entertained by dancers snake charmers etc at the main Square. If you take pictures you will have to pay them. We went on the hop on hop off bus but didn't think much of it compared with other countries were we have used it. There are two lines one for city and one for outskirts. The tourist bus experience wasn't that exciting and I think the 48hrs ticket is a waste of money. 24 hours ticket is 145 DIR and that's all you need coz tour lasts about an hour without hopping off and the other line that goes to oasis and palamaire lasts 1 hour 10 min. The good thing is the Oasis tourist bus passes by the hotel if you want to get off just ask.    Check Out  On our last day they let us stay in our room until 1pm so we could relax. At check out there was some misunderstanding about taxes they thought we had to pay them but I assured them they were included when we booked our holiday through a third party travel agent. They phoned someone to verify and it turned out I was right and they apologised.  In all we enjoyed our stay at this beautiful resort and if in Marrakkech again we would definitely visit again.,Date of stay: January 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/missyj498

I work in the travel industry myself and see lots of hotels when I go away. This one compares with any 5* I've been in. I found the staff to be friendly but due to my lack of French and maybe their lack of English (though the higher up the chain you went the better the spoken English became) we got by - theres not too many ways to order a meal or a beer. The rooms are very comfortable and the hotel is spotless. I agree re the bath tub and the curtainlooks great but a walk in shower would maybe have been better. Apart from that the wi-fi worked perfectlyeven out by the pool. I ate dinner 2 nights during the staythe choice was good and the standard excellentsame for breakfast.The only thing I would change is the choice of TV channels for English speakers - theres only so much CNN news you can watch !! There must have been 15 French channels though maybe balance things out a bit. The hotels bar was very goodthey had nice music playing and a guy called Hamid was very attentive with the service and even had time for a quick chat which is always good. My only 1 gripe was 2 of the nightclubs in the complexMoscova and Narjis - is it really necessary to charge MAD 100 for a bottle of beer which the hotel itself only charges MAD 40 for?

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,IndyGuynside wrote a review Jan 2014,30,Barely Three stars - but remember this is Morocco,I have been attending a large business meeting at the Hotel this week. In fact we used both the Hotel Du Golf and the adjacent Palmeraie where I have stayed before. This is a very nice complex and has significant potential. Since my last trip in 2011 there has been investments in restaurants bars and other parts of the facilities.    This hotel is OK but certainly not up to European standards. I have been here several days and I see lots of staff trying their best to do a good job but nobody smiles and they have that lost look like the are significantly under paid and overworked. They are very interested in tips and you get that guilty feeling about what you tip when you look into their sad face.    My room was acceptable but nothing more. It has this strange shower set-up with a oval shaped tub and a shower curtain that does not go all the way around the tub. This creates a significant mess and is frankly unworkable. The mirror is off-set from the sink which caused me to cut myself shaving.    Service is OK nothing spectacular and not what you would find in Europe but again this is Morocco and people should not have that expectation at a place like this. In my opinion they have too much staff - people standing around restrooms all night waiting for it to need to be cleaned.    I used the gym which could be a nice place but is not. No paper towels to clean the equipment broken equipment dirty equipment poorly maintained equipment TV system works poorly. No towels to use while working out so the equipment is grimy and unhygienic. The locker room is tight the sauna dirty. And the most difficult issue was lots of locals using the gym and the intimidating manner which they take over the place talk loudly monopolize the equipment and generally make you feel like you should be someplace else.    I thought the food was good. It's not Paris but they did an OK job.

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Sheri L wrote a review Jan 2014,40,Great Place To Stay,I really enjoyed the 4 night stay we had at this hotel. The staff was friendly the room was both big and beautiful the bathroom nice. There was a VIP Party which was to take place on our last night in the hotel. Staff informed us upon check in and got us rooms away from the noise. About 20 minutes to the city centre but definitely the moneys worth. I enjoyed my stay here. Since it was December we didnt use the pool but we had a view of the pool area from our room and that as well was lovely. I would stay here again.,Date of stay: December 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Vienna, Austria",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SheriLein
Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Amy S wrote a review Nov 2013,40,"Modern, clean and lovely option for Marrakech, though not central",The Hotel du Golf is part of the Palmeraie Golf Resort compound. It is the modern property (versus say the Palmeraie Golf Palace which is in traditional Moroccan style) and is an excellent choice for someone looking to enjoy the modern comforts and amenities. In truth my own style would be more of a riad in the medina (fully traditional) but this is a great choice for either a family holiday with younger children (great for sitting by the gorgeous pool and staying on the compound) or as it was for me a business convention or event. It's a $50 taxi ride into the medina (main square) or the hotel can set you up with a guide and driver. The restaurant is nice but definitely NOT cheap. I disagree with the person who said the service is terrible. I found it to be very good. Look they're not the speediest but they are very kind and nearly everyone in the hotel speaks very good English. I give this a very good. But it's little things like the fact that they NEVER restock the mini bar that keeps this from a higher rating.,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Portland, Maine",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blondventures

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,natashawendy wrote a review Oct 2013,30,"Could be a lovely hotel, but lazy staff, poor service and ant-infested rooms",I stayed in Hotel Du Golf with a group of friends the last weekend of September.    On arrival we were treated with a fresh cold drink and the reception staff were very friendly and welcoming. However this quickly went downhill. When we checked into our room I quickly noticed that it was infested with ants in the bathroom on the floor and most disturbingly in the bed. The sheets too were stained with dark colours. After phoning down to reception they sent up a member of staff with mosquito repellent...clearly ineffective for ants. We then moved to a different room to the other side of the hotel with the most horrendous view of a rubbish dump.    However overlooking this we went down to the pool which was beautiful and relaxing. However this didn't come without problems. Staff were extremely relaxed when it came to processing your orders having to wait up to 20 minutes to receive a bottle of water. Eventually we had to go up to the bar ourselves and stand there until they brought it to us.    Reception staff were less than friendly when we complained about this and saw no issue in ants in our room and rude staff by the pool.    It is a great shame as the hotel itself is lovely with great amenities and close to Marrakech centre but the poor service and unhygienic rooms really put a downer on the long weekend away.,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natashawendy

The rooms were very clean and nicely decorated. The breakfast was first-class with a wide rage of local and international food to choose from.  the letdown of this hotel were: 1- reception staff were not particularily warm or welcoming except the lady Manager who was very professional her name is Nora. 2- the hotel had an issie with sewage smell especially if your room in on the ground level.

In your small kasbah you feel like in a douar. Then you need a pleasant walk among palm trees to reach the large swimming pool for extreme sunbathing. For breakfast or lunch try the luxurious buffet in a spacious palace-style room. Warm and professional service except for the slow moving reception.

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,maggie amersham wrote a review May 2013,40,Super stylish hotel,We stayed a couple of weeks ago at this hotel. The hotel is really super very stylish the interior and exterior designs are wonderful. The great thing is that you have the use of all the facilities of this hotel and its sister hotel the Palmeraie Golf so have access to a heated indoor pool and all their other pools as well. Norah who I think is on the Management team deserves a special mention. She was absolutely lovely always checking that we were enjoying ourselves and that we were having a good time. A real credit to the Hotel. The Manager at breakfast was also excellent making sure we had everything we needed.    I would definitely have given the hotel 5 stars but for the poor service around the pool bar where we were just ignored drinks/food ordered didn't turn up etc. We gave up on day 3. However this didn't spoil our time as we went to the sister Hotel Palmerie Golf for pool bar service where we were served immediately and also had lunch at the Italian restaurant and at the golf club which was very pleasant.      The bedrooms were super and we had a really good night's sleep. The shuttle bus was great and the driver really helpful.

Frankly it is more like a Crowne Plaza. My only complaint would be that the door did not block sound from the hallway very well. My room had a nice little balcony big modern bathroom with good lighting which is rare in the EMEA region a tea kettle bathrobes and slippers lots of outlets all the good stuff. The breakfast however was mediocre in selection and quality of food but they did cook eggs to order and make pancakes. It was winter and I was at a conference so I didn't get out much or even see the pool much less use it. In classic American chain style the hotel itself is located well away from the city behind guarded walls well insulated from any danger of actually experiencing the country you are in if you want to avoid it. The golf course is right across the road. So if you want to visit Morocco but feel like you are in a Disneyland version of it this is a good choice.

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Paul J wrote a review Dec 2012,20,What a great room.......................,Thats about all the positive side I can say about this resort as its a shambles as far as the management goes. I find it really difficult to find anything positive about this resort and since posting reviews this is the first time I have felt so disgusted at the sheer lack of any service whatsoever.    The check in and onwards was just full of problems throughout but by far the worst was the attitude of most of the staff. Rude and ignorant is the best way I can put it. The barmen were by far a class of their own. It was a privilege to be served by them or at least it felt that way. I asked for a drink and the barman told me they had none. I did think he was joking until he walked off. He spent the rest of the time yawning and leaning on the coffee machine trying to sleep.  The breakfast on the first morning looked like someone had thrown everything across the breakfast room. There was a big corporate party in and as they left the staff simply ignored the mess and left everything where it was. We made up our own table and got our own coffee and tea. The next day there were two managers I think in the room and it was very different. The tables were cleared and places set out.    We went to eat in the resort and went to 5 restaurants and could not get a table despite them being half empty.The receptionist told us in the afternoon there was no need to make a reservation as you can always get a table. We ended up in the bar paying 600mad for very poor quality food.    The courtesy shuttle comes form across the resort and does not even come in sometimes to the holiday inn. The first time we tried the bus pulled in the driver got out began shouting into his mobile then got back in the bus and drove off. We waited till the next one 2 hours later but that didn't even turn up.    Its a long way to the centre and works out expensive every day to go in and out. There is however an abundance of great places to go once there where you will get outstanding service. Kosy Lounge Pepe Nero and Gastro MK. These are the same if not cheaper to eat and by far the best places we found. it will work out cheaper to go there than be spoken to rudely and given at best average food.    if you want to stay at this resort don't expect any service but expect a really good room if you book a suite,Date of stay: November 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ethixman

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Eddie L wrote a review Nov 2012,50,"Beautiful Hotel, run by Fun & Friendly people",I have stayed in many Holiday Inns across Europe and Asia but this was my first in Africa and what a treat it was! Being a Platinum Holiday Inn Member (Priority Club) I was automatically given a Beautiful and very spacious suite overlooking the golf course and mountains (see Pic Below). The Check in experience was good but not perfect! Saying that the more i got to know the Team the more welcoming and friendly they were this was mainly down to the language barrier their English was about as good as my French!! Although there was a few people that spoke Good English (Mainly Mona Sophia Sara Tariq & Zidane) the 6 people i have mentioned really did go the extra mile and made my stay that little more special (Thank you to you all).  The Food was fantastic and being in the leisure trade all my life i know the difference and the service in general lived up to its 5 star rating. The Rooms/Suites were spotlessly clean and fresh sheets were delivered and made up every day. The beds were far too comfortable which made getting up in the mornings hard work!!!! Seriously though they had either Feather mattress's or a Feather Mattress topper whatever it was i wish i owned one. The only issue i had with the cleaning was there were no wet floor signs and considering the entire hotel flooring is marble it was like a skating rink most mornings.  Overall it was one of the nicest Holiday inns I’ve ever stayed in only super seeded by the Holiday inn Pattaya Thailand.  One thing i didnt realise until my 3rd day was the hotel is part of a complex and short walk to a huge communal Pool restaurants (Japanese Brazilian Moroccan etc) which were all good there’s also clothes and gift shops dotted about. The Hotel is about a 15 minute taxi journey to the albeit wonderful mayhem of the medina and the new town although there is a free courtesy Coach running there and back from the hotel. The Taxi is a fixed rate of 100 Dirham’s (£8.00) each way (excluding tips). One slight fault is the safes in the rooms the strong and sturdy but fixed to the inside of a chest of drawers so you could just pinch the drawer? Not that i was ever concerned about leaving valubles in my room the Hotel was very safe  All in all an awesome Hotel and a fantastic Country....  TIPS:  They don’t speak Arabic nearly all people speak French  They except US Dollars Euros and Sterling as well as their own currency / Dirham’s  Don’t change your money in the UK much better rates in Marrakech (and you are only allowed to take approx £92 /1000 Dirham’s into the country.  Do not take photos of the guards in their ancient and Traditional Uniforms its completely illegal (i found out the hard way!)  Always carry small amounts of currency as tipping is a must and small notes/denominations are hard to come by.  If anyone entertains you (belly dancers snake charmers etc) don’t take a photo of them until you arrange a price first.  If going to the Medina or New Town arrange with the Taxi that drops you off to pick you up at a set time as the competition between Taxi drivers especially outside the Medina is fierce and aggressive to say the least.

We ate several times at the various restaurants in the comples nice food but quite pricey. However there is a small shop (out the hotel turn right walk up the road for 10 mins) which sorted us out for drinks and snacks.    The hotel is beatiful and modern immaculate and pristine.

The menu was the same fairly basic lunchtime menu though fine; wasn't very inspiring. Pool and grounds backing onto the golf course were very nice and plenty of sun loungers available.

Initial impressions were very good we were able to check into our room at 10am we recieved a complimentary upgrade to a suite as we were Platinum Card holder's and the quality and overall appearance of the hotel were of a very high standard and consistent with it's 5 star grading.    However the overall service proposition of the hotel lets it's down very badly. Staff service in the restaurants and bars is virtually non-existant. Its not there wasnt enough staff quite the contrary its just they dont know how to give good service or in some cases any service at all. Merely getting a drink from the bar was a frustrating experience typified by slow service and on many occasions the wrong drink being served.    The main restaurant in the hotel is closed in the evenings and the only option offered is the limited snack bar menu eaten on your laps in the bar. We elected to walk to a neighbouring hotel who shares the site which entailed a 5 minute walk around the back of the hotel via a poorly lit walkway not a very pleasant experience. The site is promoted as having 6 restaurants but when we were there only 2 were open Overall however the quality of the food served was very good especially the Japanese restaurant.

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Matt F wrote a review Oct 2012,40,"Luxurious Hotel, Great Pool",We stayed at the Holiday Inn Marrakech for a week in October (In fact Im writing this from our room overlooking the pool!)    This is a fabulous hotel - whilst it carries the Holiday Inn brand so you know it'll be clean when you arrive you'll find that it is actually very unique and different to the stereotypical Holiday Inn. This is a franchise so still quite 'moroccan'.    It looks almost brand new - the rooms are smart and tasteful with enormous super comfy beds and the pool is beautiful and very clean. Staff are great and the Manager is very accommodating with any issues you may have. Not many of the staff speak English but with a few gestures and a bit of explanation you can normally get what you need. Free shuttle to the centre which is great as taxis are about 120 - 150 Dirhams each way. Only reason this is very good and not excellent is because of the food / menu which is really bland and boring. Breakfast is fabulous but they have the same menu for evening meals lunch time at the pool bar and for room service which consists of sandwiches or a choice of 3 pasta dishes. There aren't many other places to eat apart from Leroys so be warned about this. The hotel is aimed at adults and business - don't bring your kids.

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,rinconimi wrote a review Oct 2012,20,Could be so good...,"The staff love to remind you that this is the only 5* Holiday Inn. I would beg to contest the credibility of the 5* rating.    The staff are hit-and-miss. Luckily I speak French and a tiny amount of Arabic so there was no language barrier but you will find that some staff are lovely and others apparently couldn't care less!    Check-in was painfully slow. Initially my reservation could not be found. I had to show a physical copy of my confirmation and then return one hour later. Then there was a copious amount of bureaucratic form-filling to be done; more than other Moroccan hotels that I had stayed in. I was sat down to work through the questionnaire. On completion my room key had still not been issued so there was a further wait.    The pool is very nice; the water had patently been cleaned on our last morning as it was crystal clear. The pool bar is convenient though expensive by local standards.    We lost all the electricity in our room. Despite calling through to reception twice nobody was despatched to assist us and it was only when I went along the corridor and into another room where I found a housekeeper was I able to find assistance.    Next to the hotel is a facility called ""Nikki Beach"". Here every day incredibly loud music is played from the afternoon into the evening. Unable to rest in the late afternoon I contacted reception to complain about the unreasonable noise and request a room change. I was told ""The noise is Nikki Beach which plays music every day"". Is that an excuse?! Nobody called me back with notice of a room change even when I called reception thirty minutes later to again request.    A feature that does lend itself to the purported 5* rating is that you are led to your room by a bellhop although I would rather that this were an optional feature as I find it embarrassing when I have just arrived and have not yet procured and local currency that the bellhop is hovering expecting a tip.    At checkout I was issued a bill for the remaining unpaid taxes. I offered my credit card but was told that I could not pay the taxes (MAD equivalent of around GBP 8) because the amount was too little. I asked the hotel to simply charge the card without using my PIN number: apparently not an option. Nor would they waive the charge or allow me to pay it on arrival on my next confirmed stay. Not carrying any cash I had to physically make a trip to a local bank withdraw a note return to the reception and pay the lady!! This delayed my departure by one hour causing me to miss my lunchtime tour bus into the Atlas Mountains which was rescheduled for the next day. At what ""upscale/5*"" hotel are you ever forced to pay using cash?! I was also overcharged for taxes on a Priority Club Reward Night -- and charged twice for one night.    Finally on my last night I had booked a Terrace Suite but was placed in the lowest-category Standard Room. No partial refund or goodwill gesture was offered.    I have since contacted IHG Guest Relations to try and rectify the billing issue. My query was forwarded to the hotel management and I was promised a response within 48 hours however one month later and alack nothing has been received.    I surmise that the hotel wants as little to do as possible with the IHG/Holiday Inn brands as nobody wears any kind of Holiday Inn uniform or badge there are massive issues with Reward Nights and Priority Club bookings all my bills are printed on ""Hotel du Golf"" headed paper the majority of the signage regards ""Hotel du Golf""; and all their email addresses are hosted on a Moroccan website. Perhaps they are using IHG just for funding or to get a good flow of guests from an international company. Either way It seems that the hotel is complying with the absolute minimum of the terms in its franchise agreement!

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Elsa40 wrote a review Oct 2012,50,Holiday Inn service exceptional,Am currently writing this review while sitting at the bar in the Holiday Inn Du Golf before returning home tomorrow. I can honestly say that on arrival we thought oh no what have we done the location and the weather were not good. Now after 7 nights I cannot say enough about the friendliness and kindness of all the staff at the bar and the pool. They are all so kind and friendly and although our conversations have been in broken French and english we got by and they have all been fantastic. Special mention to Toufique aka Manuel Tariq Karim Unes Ismail Nebil Adel and Robert De Niro. The service provided by these guys was second to none and we cannot wait to come back to this oasis in Marrakech to sample the generosity and kindness shown to us both by them all. Our room was absolutely beautiful with fantastic views of the golf course. Some laughs to be had by the so called golfers hitting the flag pole and landing in the bunker. Although this hotel is about 20 minutes from Marrakech it is a relaxing haven from the hustle and bustle of the mad city. Would highly recommend a visit and don't be put off by where it is at the end of the day it is well worth a visit and although quiet it is full of peace and tranquility. One last point Mona on reception was also excellent and sorted out our wifi problem and again was very friendly and helpful.

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Andrew300 wrote a review Oct 2012,40,Beautiful hotel,Our room was spectacular with two balconies had been decorated with rose petals and had one of the best bathrooms we had seen. The reception staff were helpful and spoke reasonable English . The only downside was that the bar/restaurant staff spoke little or no English (try ordering beef with chips and veg!).  The pool area was well maintained shame about the rain. The golf course looked very good if only I had my clubs with me.,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Staffordshire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andrew300
Hotel Du Golf Rotana,RosP wrote a review Sep 2012,40,A good base,We stayed here during our short break in Marrakech. Upon arrival we were fortunate enough to be upgraded to a suite (Priority Club members) which was very nice. This meant we had a corner balcony with sunbeds. Having read some of the review concerning staff and rudeness we feel they were unjust. The Holiday Inn is what it is. If you're looking for somewhere to use as a base then it's ideal. If however you're looking for something a bit more then maybe this isn't the hotel for you. Clean and tidy helpful staff shuttle bus into the Medina (15 mins away last one 6pm). Can't comment on the food in any great detail as we only had one meal here but what we had was very good. Good breakfast buffet and you're left to relax over breakfast.,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Northampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosamund_bone
Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Racoon12345 wrote a review Sep 2012,30,Very Quiet and Relaxing Stay,My husband and I travelled to Marrakech in August knowing that it was Ramadan and that it would be very hot. I had emailed the hotel before booking to ask if there were and restrictions  which would affect tourists. We were advised that there were none.  The hotel building was probably the most luxurious Holiday Inn we had ever visited. We stayed in a King pool suite which was extremely spacious and had a wrap around balcony with 2 sun loungers and a patio set and views over the golf course. The room decor was excellent and seemed quite new. The bathroom had a freestanding tub and a separate spacious shower cubicle. The bed was huge and very comfortable.  The hotel was exceptionally quiet so there was no trouble getting a space by the pool. As with the whole hotel the pool area was clean and generally well looked after.The pool was large with a separate children's area partially in the shade.  On the whole we found the service to be quite friendly but painfully slow especially at lunchtime. Even with only a couple of tables to serve the lunch snacks could take up to an hour to arrive. The food was average and quite expensive as were the drinks - both alcoholic and non alcoholic. The extreme heat meant that it was necessary to take on lots of fluids. A 330ml can of coke cost about £3 from the minibar and about the same from the bar. We found a small shop about a 5-6 minute walk away from the hotel- turn right out of the main entrance. It is open from 10-6 and sells a variety of soft drinks and snacks at a fraction of the cost of the hotel. We stocked up everyday and kept the drinks cold in the minibar.  In the evening there were usually more bar staff than guests but they seemed intent on avoiding eye contact thus making it difficult to get a refill even when sitting at the bar!  The hotel next door has a variety of restaurants most of which were closed probably due to Ramadan but Leroy's Kfe served a variety of International and Morroccan dishes.We ate here several times due to the lack of alternative but the food and Morroccan wine were always very good.  The hotel is a few miles from the centre of Marrakech and there is a hotel shuttle bus to and from several times a day. We used this on one occasion but the city was unbearably hot and dry.  French is the main language and only very basic English is spoken by most of the hotel staff. So brush up on your French before you go!!  For what we wanted - to relax and unwind - we found the hotel more than adequate. The food and service could certainly be improved.,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sydney, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Racoon12345

Unfortunately the staff has been very unfriendly especially the women. We made some very disappointing experiences with the shuttle bus which didn't stop at the hotel to pick us up and it was claimed by the hotel staff that it never stops at the hotel when it's full. This is a 5 * hotel and this is not acceptable! We were left with the impression that tourists are not very welcome there even though they are somewhat dependent on them.

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,LB1313 wrote a review May 2012,30,Pleasant facility -Unpleasant service and product offering,I would like to note that I was a guest at this facility during a very large Insurance conference that was taking place at the convention center and I know that the hotel and its neighbouiring hotel were both fully booked and probably overloaded with people and requests. Nevertheless this is not a disclaimer for untrained staff and poor product offering.    The rooms were spacious modern and clean. Internet was for free and available at all times. Pool area very relaxing and nice after a long day of work or during the day for lounging around.    Breakfast was not appetizing to the eye nor to the taste buds....    Service providers (waiters head waiters and general staff) need intensive training and education.    A very positive note goes out to the concierge desk who were super pro-active and went the extra mile to help guests with their different requests.

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Derby88 wrote a review May 2012,10,Not for families and the staff are dishonest,"We spoke to the hotel and the Holiday Inn UK call center and confirmed that the room would be able to cater for a couple and two children ages 10 and 11.    When we got to the hotel the staff said that all the rooms were the same in size and that the website would let you pay extra for 4 in a room but they couldnt fit two extra camp beds in for the children.    We then got a room with 2 full size beds and a camp bed. This was to be cheaper but after 3 requests to speak to a manager about a lower cost we were still charged the higher rate anyway. about US$60 extra.    When we checked out I exchanged US$200 and has given less than the exchange rate quoted on the board and was told when I asked ""the exchange rate had changed over night and they hadnt updated the notice board yet"". Basically the staff pocketed about US$8 rather and give me the quoted rate.    The La Palmeraie van does not really have a schedule and if full will just skip pick up times as it did during our stay so we ended up taking taxi's to town instead.    This hotel is not for people with a low tolerance for poor service.    On the good side the hotel is quite new the decor very funky and the pool is very nice. Also the food in the hotel was quite good.    However I felt like I was taken for a financial ride and paid U$68 when I shouldn't have.

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,jockc d wrote a review May 2012,50,Amazing !!!,Very pleasant hotel located at the Palmeraie neighborhood where you can easily find more palm threes than people !    It's the first time ever I try a 5 Stars ( with a reasonable price !) Holiday where colors and decoration took me away from the business and stressful days that I have back in London.    Staff is very welcoming and helpful but needs a little more training in English.    Rooms are clean and smells really good thanks to a young lady from the housekeeping.    The reception was quite busy because they had a business conference at that moment I wish if they can find a way to give priority to individual guests  but to be honest before our turn was up a nice lady from the guest relations helped us with our inquiry it was much appreciated.    The next day we went to get a drink by the pool drink menus are nicely designed and set around the pool we got the whole day to relax and tan.  A young European manager by the pool restaurant served us personally he looked very professional and is even fluent in English.    The hotel offers a shuttle service to the city ( about 18 minutes ) but trust me you would rather sacrifice 200MAD to get a taxi cab to the city instead of waiting for it !    In overall I recommend this hotel if you don't mind to be a little far away from the city. a 3rd restaurant at this location will be fabulous due to the lack of the menu choices for lunch or dinner specially for stays of 3 nights or more.    Will definitely come back    Great hotel great people !,Date of stay: May 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jockcd
Hotel Du Golf Rotana,trippedu0 wrote a review May 2012,30,Very hit and miss!,We stayed in a King Terrace suite from the 4-11th April 2012. On first impressions the hotel and staff seemed very good but once you scratched under the surface and it is very disappointing indeed.  The suite itself was very well appointed apart from the fact there was three of us staying in it and it only had one double bed. I had to chase up house keeping and reception three times before an extra bed was supplied. For the whole week we only had enough bathroom linen for two people. Also the electrics in the room were faulty. There were lovely flowers in the room on arrival but they were just left to die over the week.    We found reception staff in general to be very rude. We were told on arrival we were entitled to a free Hammam. That statement was swiftly retracted.  We were told a mini bus service would take us to the city centre. It didn't turn up.  It wasn't until we were being ripped off by the price of our taxi on departure (400mad) that they have a facility to give you cash back on your debit card at reception. We got the feeling the receptionist was related to the taxi driver!    For three days of our stay there was a conference on at the hotel which is really what the hotel is geared up for. In this time we found that the service in the hotel and pool bar were just awful. On one occasion we waited over 30 minutes just for a drink in the pool bar and nearly and hour for our food to be served whilst at the table next to us where there were three Moroccan business people eating they had four members of staff waiting on them. When we had to send the food back because it was stone cold the waitress burst into tears and ran off. The pool bar staff themselves were very friendly they just need some guidance and proper training. There was a European manager hovering around both bars for the week but all he seemed to do was change his suit. We spent most of the week in the hotel next door and had lunch everyday at the golf club. It was cheaper and the service was much better.  The pool itself was clean but found the pool man on one occasion to be asleep when we needed towels and our drinks glasses still by the pool from the previous day.  Would like to think that one day they may be able to provide 5 star service but would have to think very hard before returning.,Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Hitchin, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trippedu0

Great hotel if you play golf because the hotel is on the border of a golf course.    The rooms were of good size and pleasant... Bathroom very design but problem with shower curtains that are too small and even if you try avoid you end up having water on your bathroom floor which is less pleasant for afterwards....    Wifi was not working in our room because we were in a bad zone where signal was either weak or not working but friends that were on the other side did not have any problem.    Breakfast could be of better quality so to be up to standards of the design of the hotel. As for the SPA went next door to visit and when we saw the prices decided to avoid it because prices seem to be twice as much than other SPA's in Marrakech (excluding the very top rated ones)    If it wasn't for the WiFi problem I would highly recommend this hotel if you don't mind being far from the center of Marakech.,Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Paris, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vegalion

At arrival we searched for the driver but no one was there. We called the hotel twice they told us to just wait. the tird time we called the hotel they just did not pick up the phone. after 30-40 minutes waiting we were tired and just took a taxi. the ride was only 200 mad so you can imagine how much the hotel earns!    2. The hotel advertises to have a shuttle service to the city.. the next morning we wanted to take the 9.30 shuttle...at 10.10 h still no shuttle!! We complained at reception they told us we had to waite till 10.30 for the next one. they told us that if the shuttle is full it doesnt stop at the holiday innn!! What kind of crap is this?? They dont tell you anything and just leave you waiting in front of thehotel... we were angry and wanted to speak to the manager...the receptionist( guy) told us to sit down and he would call the manager...he/she did not border to come see us. the receptionist arranged a taxi for us to the city. the receptionist was rude and arrogant.    3. We had lunch at the swimming pool bar and ordered simply 2 ceaser salads. 1 with chicken and 1 without. we got 2 salads without and when we told the waiter he looked at the plate without saying sorry went back to the kichen with the plate and came back 5 minutes later. He smashed the plate on the table still not saying a word. we wanted to start eating but the chicked was still comlpletely raw inside! Again we showed the server and again he reacted irritated..no sorry at all. how is it possible an attitude like that?    4. We asked the receptionist how much it would approx. cost uw to take a taxi back from the city to hotel in the evening. he told us 200 mad...after negociating the absolute maximum you should pay is 100 mad even during the evening. i think that the receptionist should protect the hotelguests from being riped and give some more explanation to negociate and tell the guests not to pay more than 100 mad..this is already very high because marrocans pay less with the meter on.    5. The hotel is situated ca. 15 minutes drive from the city. Arond the hotel there are a few restaurants but the prices are sky high. in the hotel and around it there is nothjng really to do so you can get quite bored. although the hotel is furnished very tastfully modern.    6. There is though one lightpoint.. at the poolbar is working one girl. she was the only staff who was very friendly and helpfull.    7. the swimming pool area is nice.    8. We asked the reception if it was possible to get a room with swimming poolview. she said"" i will get back to you"" she didnt so after 2 days we asked again and again she said "" i will get back to you"" . Offcourse she never came back to me.. why not just tell me that it was not possible??    Ingeneral the hotel is ok but you can very obvious see that the staff is not trained to give good and friendly service and a genioun smile.

Hotel Du Golf Rotana,hghailan wrote a review Feb 2012,50,Excellent Property With Amazing facilities,"This was an exploring trip and was for 4 nights (5 days) arriving at the hotel by the advanced arranged airport pickup (300MAD) in a Landrover sport. arriving the hotel which was in a very greet and full of palms area and a beautiful Golf course.  The landrover pulled in-front of the HI and you get treated as a 5* property not like the topical Holiday Inn which is more like ongoing family brand. so you get the door men opening the doors for you and getting your luggage staff are multi lingual and speak many languages.  Guest relation in this property is involved more than any other property in any other hotel as the make sure that everything runs into a high level of service quality.    We have been upgraded into the privilege suite which was so beautiful and over looking the gulf course.    First night we have spent at the hotel as we have arrived late and were tired of all the travelling.    We had a greet help through our stay at the hotel from a very beautiful and helpful Guest relation Reem she has recommended the restaurant in the complex called ""Dar Khalti"" as we wanted to try the Moroccan tagine.  This is an amazing atmosphere and nice live Moroccan music and the food was the best ever we had in Morocco (2 course meal for two with drinks was 1450MAD) It worth every penny great atmosphere and great food.    we have spent the second day in the centre by using the hotel shuttle service to and from the city and they run as  HOTEL ----> CITY  9.30  11.30  14.30  16.30  1800    CITY -------> HOTEL  10.30  12.30  15.30  17.30  18.30    Next day we had breakfast at the hotel restaurant which was a full breakfast and has a Moroccan breakfast section if you want to try it.    you could spend a hall morning walking around the resort.  temperature was a bit cold and needed proper cold clothes from morning till 11 am and from 1800 on-wards in between you would need a good jumper/cardigan.    Reem has recommended jad mahal for dinner and that was the most amazing restaurant I have ever been in my life you would need a reservation definitely or you would be turned back. taxi fare to and from the hotel is around 100-150 MAD always negotiate in advance.    Third day we spent a beautiful time at a day out adventure called ourika we paid 20 Euros including transport to and from the hotel.  Get it for the centre kiosks (Make sure u take a hiking trainers and warm clothes).  in the evening we went to the new Brazilian restaurant opened in the resort and that was a WOW very good fun with live music and carnival dancers on stage. nice Brazilian food and great style atmosphere and music (we spent 1500 MAD for two people).    Tips: don't start splashing ur money in town as everyone will try to beg u harder for money and you would be out of cash at the end of the day if you are a nice person.  Tips: always consult the concierge for all activities and eating.  Tips: don't spend too long in Central Marrakeshis it only need a couple of days to cover it. so try to arrange for excursions and days out to see the real Moroccan.  Tips: Take small taxis they are cheaper.  Tips: use cash machines to withdraw money max is 2000 MAD per day or exchange in town after a good research.

It cost us 250 MAD to get to hotel form airport- taxi driver wanted to charge us 350 MAD. When we pulled up to the front of the hotel someone quickly opened the car door and took our bags inside. We were given registration forms to fill out along with a number that was given to us when we cleared immigration ( was wondering what that # was for when stamped in passport). Anway after we checked in a bellman escorted us to our room explained everything to us. I was surprised at how modernbeautiful and clean the room was...with a balcony overlooking the pool.  Staff was very attentive tried their best to assist us with the little english they spoke- because I sure dont know a word in french or arabic :). This is a great hotel for Golfers because there is nothing else to do around the hotel. The hotel does offer free shuttle to Jemma el fna square every hour where all the excitement is shopping restaurant market snake charmers etc. Overall a great hotel would stay there again only downside I felt bored had to constantly commute to where the action was which was 15 minutes away- so if you are looking for much needed relaxation this is the place for you plus the bed is unbelieavably comfortable.,Date of stay: January 2012,,"Fort Lauderdale, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelex2
Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Max W wrote a review Jan 2012,40,Had some problems but overall a hotel that one time will be the best,Normally I had another hotel in mind but when I checked some chains I noticed there was a new Holiday Inn hotel in Marrakech the first one in Morocco. It is also one of the only 5 star Holiday Inn hotels in the entire world. I booked the best non-suite room with breakfast around 15 days in advance on their website. There were not many reviews but I did not have many expectations because the price was lower than others in Marrakech.    We arrived by train from Casablanca and at the right side of the new build train station we took a taxi. The fare quoted was 120 MAD to the Holiday Inn. The taxi ride was about 25 minutes but the driver did not know the hotel in the beginning but when we told Hotel Du Golf he knew where he should drive.    We arrived at the new hotel and got out of the taxi. Immediately someone came to take our luggage and we were brought inside. On the right side was the reception and we headed to the only lady not occupied. She did not have a name tag but here name was Ms. Safia. We gave our Platinum Priority club card and she said we could have a seat while she checked us in.    A few minutes later we received a juicy welcome drink and 3 papers to fill in with all our details regarding our passport occupation addresses …. The only one missing is : How much do you earn. Instead of making a simple copy of our passports and copying our addresses from our priority club account we had to fill it in.    After 15 minutes waiting already Ms. Safia came to us and asked if we had a reservation because she could not find it in her system. We told her clearly we had a reservation and I gave her my confirmation page. She made some phone calls and after another 10 minutes she came back and told us she couldn’t find it but we got our booked room. Unfortunately she did not know the platinum status nor the benefits. She asked my platinum card even though she had it in her possession for 30 minutes. Then I had to explain her the benefits of the status but when she called her Room Division manager we got an upgrade to a Junior Suite room 6155.    Ms. Rim a Guest relation executive brought us to our room. She had some difficulties explaining everything in English but luckily we speak French too. She was still quite young and explained us some essentials like breakfast hours internet and facilities. Strange thing is that she gave me other hours of breakfast than Ms. Safia told us. Our room was on the same floor as the lobby and almost at the end of the long corridor. Our Junior Suite had a big entrance with many closets and a special Laptop safe inside one of them. Then on the left side was the bedroom itself with a big King size bed with a sofa on the right side. There was also a brand new TV nice and modern IP phone and a cupboard with the mini bar in it. The room had a fresh looking wooden floor and further left in the room was the bathroom. There was a bath and a sink. The only problem for us was that the left window in the bathroom overlooked our small terrace and without any separation we could look in the bathroom from outside. There was no curtain at all. The same problem at the right side of the bathroom.    On the right side in the room were the toilet and a separate sink. There we had that problem too. When I was making a picture of the toilet I could see my neighbor one level higher just watching me standing next to the toilet. There was no curtain whatsoever.    The television was not working and some minutes later they brought us a welcome basket of fruit along with some other small snacks. Unfortunately no drinks whatsoever not even a small bottle of water. We were also missing a kettle for making some tea. The room was very modern and quite new. Unfortunately when I was in the shower in the bath the room above my flushed the toilet or flushed the bath. There were liters of water leaking into our bath. Water along with pieces of the roof was falling on me. The towels were gray the same for my bathrobes.    I went downstairs and told the reception about this but they could not understand my problem so I had to ask the duty manager. The Room division manager Mr. Karim listened to me and immediately called and arranged another room. He apologized for it and gave us new keys for another Suite but this time with a bigger terrace. We got room 6165 this one was the last room in the corridor. They offered us to move our luggage but as it was just a few rooms away we did it our self but they send someone for moving the extra bed.    Ms. Rim took us to that room and showed it to me. The room had no big entrance but also some closets at the right side with fresh flowers on it. On the left side was a non-windowed bathroom with a big modern bath and a separate rain shower. Further behind another door was a toilet. The bathroom was big and modern. It was very nice and had full privacy like it should be.    The bedroom had a big King size bed a desk and again a TV. Unfortunately we could not find the remote so we called the reception for it. The right side of the room had a sofa chair sofa and the extra bed. Our big terrace surrounded our entire room and we had a nice view on the golf and also on the rest of the hotel.    I went to the concierge desk on the right side of the entrance because of the sign information. There was no one so I asked someone. Ms. Rim came to me. I asked for a map and the major sights but disappointingly she did not explain anything at all. I had to ask for the directions of the city center and she told me for the first time the existence of a shuttle bus. She told me that from the next doors hotel departs a shuttle bus and it stops also at our hotel but when it was full it did not stop at our hotel. She told me so it was better to go to the other hotel because last days it did not stop here. She wrote me down some hours but she could not give me further details. Instead of calling the other hotel I had to go myself there by foot. I followed some sign and passed a winter village with ice skating facilities till I came in an older style lobby. The unfriendly chief concierge gave me more info but gave totally different hours than Ms. Rim gave me.    I went back to the Holiday Inn and confronted her which one were right. She asked some bellman and he told me hers were wrong. She tried to take her written hours from me but I wanted to keep them.    With not very much info I went back to my room. About restaurants she could also not give much info. We could use the restaurant from the other hotel because the Holiday Inn offers limited dinner options.    We ate during our stay 3 times in the Italian Signor Santi restaurant because for us it was the best option and best value of them all. Service was fluctuation but food overall good.    Next morning we had breakfast in the main restaurant. Two ladies did not greet us but asked us for our room number and that’s it. None of them lead us to a table so we picked one that was ready ourselves. A friendly man asked for our room number again and asked if we would like to drink something. I could just not figure out what the functions of the two ladies were. They were not doing anything just standing there and talking to each other.    The buffet itself was quite limited without toaster or toast bread and juices that were empty all the times. There was one kind of bread a sliced baguette and some smaller breads. I asked to one of the two ladies if they had normal toast bread or other kind of bread but before they could answer me a man in suit Mr. Souhaide interrupt and took over from them. He could not answer my question but was laughing with it instead. I left with a strange feeling of staff here at the hotel.    Ten minutes later he came back to me and showed me some different kind of bread still hot for us. He promised me that next day I would have the toasted bread slices. Service was good and buffet was limited. There was cheese ham salami fruits pastries and juices. When three people entered the restaurant service became more efficient and quicker. It was the General Manager Mr. Karim the Guest relation Manager Ms. Nora and the Food and Beverage manager Mr. Dominique. Mr. Dominique and Ms. Nora had to assist staff members and had to clean empty bottles of juice from the buffet.    At 11.30 we took the shuttle bus from the next-door hotel. There were 30 people or more waiting for a 14 seated van. It was a disaster but we managed to get on it. The shuttle bus took us in 30-40 minutes to the Fna Square.    In the evening I took the shuttle bus back to the hotel and when I was at the reception I needed to ask some train info. Because everyone was busy a very friendly Ms. Nora came to me and asked if he could help me with something. I explained her I wanted to book train tickets because on our previous journey second class was more a disaster. She called for me the ONCF multiple times and she even offered me something to drink while she was trying to get someone on the line. After 20 minutes she finally got somebody and because she could not book them she offered me that she would book them at the train station herself. She offered that because she lives close to the station and because she cares about her guests and because she has a good heart.    I passed her some comment regarding my stay that evening and hoping she would pass it by to others.    Next morning breakfast was already better service good as usual but off course not my promised bread. Juices were unfortunately mixed with each other which was not tasty at all. There were more choices but only the oranges were not tasty and dried out. Again some managers had to help the staff with the buffet.    That morning Ms. Nora informed me the hotel has its own shuttle bus because too many guests had to wait or had no place in the bus. It had the same hours so it was much easier for us. The white van left the hotel a bit too late and dropped us off at Fna Place. In the evening we planned to take it back at 17.30. At 17.25 we were at the spot and clearly could not see the van. Then the other van came but the driver rudely refused us and would not give his name to me. I so called at 17:45 the front desk number mentioned on my reservation. Instead of the front desk I was actually calling the general manager on his cellphone. He told me the 17.30 bus was cancelled and it was mentioned to everyone in the hotel. I was quite surprised because it was not mentioned to us. He told us to just wait for the next bus one hour later.    At 18.25 the bus arrived and drove towards the hotel 5 minutes early. My watch and phone are both set right so he was driving to early. Furthermore the driver told me he was at Fna Square at 17.30 and picked up some people. The manager told me it was cancelled.    I told this again to Ms. Nora she had to hear all my problems every day I hope when I come back I can say every positive thing to her.    I called around 22:00 the reception for a wake up call at 08:00.    Next morning no wake up call whatsoever.    Breakfast was excellent. Service excellent and an extensive choice for breakfast more fruit more juices and even bottled water. The two ladies were replaces by one lady who asks for a room number and lead guests to a table. The best breakfast till now in Marrakech.    We got a call from Ms. Nora apologizing for the wake up call. She asked if we needed a taxi and five minutes before it she sent a bellman for our luggage. We checked out and then the General Manager came to us and I told him some comments for the future and about the problems in our rooms. He took note of them all and assured us they will be fixed in the future.    We thought a staff member would tell our destination but instead of going to the train station the taxi took us to the airport. The porter told him we wanted to go to the airport. Luckily we managed to get on time at the train station.    Thanks to Ms. Nora our stay was very good despite some problems. The hotel has much potential and I do not doubt it will be one of the better in Marrakech. They offer a big golf course new modern rooms and free internet too.    Owh yes we got a welcome letter on our day of departure    I will definitely return in the future to this hotel and I am sure it will be much better !,Date of stay: December 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Antwerp, Belgium",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaxWeterings
Hotel Du Golf Rotana,Karimel74 wrote a review Dec 2011,40,a nice (and a new) hotel in la palmeraie,Next to Palmeraie Golf Palace this is a brand new hotel...Very different from Golf Palace because very modern in term of furniture and colors...The rooms are confortable large and the colors (green mostly) lovely...One thing that i didn't like is that the curtains are thin so you end up with day light in the room which is pretty bad for someone that is bothered by day light in his sleeping...The break fast was good and the staff helpful. If you want to stay in the Palmeraie area this hotel is a good choice.,Date of stay: December 2011,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Casablanca, Morocco",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karimel74
Hotel Du Golf Rotana,TK K wrote a review Dec 2011,30,"Lovely property, erratic staff","I recently stayed for 7 nights on business. I could write a book about my stay there but I will try to limit my review to the most relevant points.    In general terms I would say that this is a lovely property. The room are large with most of the essentials you expect from a 4-5* hotel. Apart from a somehow weirdly designed shower - basically an open walk-in solution which caused water to flood the rest of the bathroom - I have no complaints with the room. I was very comfortable (the bed was very comfortable!).    The location is a slight downside unless you're into golf or just hanging by the pool the 20 minute overpriced drive to the centre of Marrakech becomes quite tedious. The food at the hotel is no more than mediocre (I'll return to this point) and if you want to eat properly you'll have no choice but to negotiate the expensive cab fare to the centre of town (the cab prices are fixed ""cartel style"").    However what is letting this hotel down is the erratic service of the staff and some really bizarre tweaks that can get on your nerves. Here's a few of the set backs I faced during my stay:    - The attitude of the reception staff vary from really friendly to outright rude. I was basically shouted out when I tried to point out a problem with the TV (""we're working on it BE PATIENT!"").    - Upon booking a table at a downtown restaurant the young lady in the reception confirmed that the booking was made. Arriving at the restaurant there was no trace of the reservation. In fact the place wasn't even open during the time slot that the receptionist was supposed to have called the restaurant.    - I asked the reception staff on three days running if they could fix my minibar that wasn't working (it was stocked but with room temperature). Nobody even bothered looking at the minibar. After three days I gave up and stored my drinks on the table on the balcony (it gets chilly at night).    - There's some kind of a jazz theme being played (quite loud) in all communal areas (restaurant bar reception) for 14-16 hours a day. The tunes (4-5 of them maximum) are played on a loop and after 2-3 days it drives you absolutely crazy. I'm sure the staff have got used to this by now but this is a nightmare for guests.    - The food in the restaurant leaves a lot to be desired. After using the trial/error method I ended up reluctantly eating pasta (bolognese or salmone both ok) every day. Stay clear of the steak (extremely tasteless and small) or the club sandwich (served cold!).    I would like to point out that the cleaning staff was always very polite and friendly they always left my room in an immaculate state.    All considered I would try a different hotel if I were to go back to Marrakech.",Date of stay: December 2011,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Oslo, Norway",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/enixmatix
