Kenzi Menara Palace,The_Cycling_Girl wrote a review Mar 18,50,An exceptionally good value hotel,An exceptionally good value hotel. We really enjoyed our stay clean tidy good service and generally well run. The rooms need updating the shower leaked but plenty of space loads of hot water and considering what you pay still good value. Having read the previous reviews I appreciate if you want an all inclusive bar to run for all hours perhaps not the place for you but for early evening drinks then dinner it's great.  Excellent food loads of choice good fresh salads etc for dinner and enough of a variation for breakfast.  A lovely large outdoor pool which although a bit chilly in early March when we went was very peaceful (apart from the afternoon disco which is a bit irritating) we still swam! There is a heated pool adjacent.  The hotel has loads of space several seating areas for drinks a nice view across the gardens. WiFi varied you need to be near reception to get a good connection. It's about 10mins in a taxi to the centre of Marrakech which is about €15.  We recommend and would go back.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bagneres-de-Luchon, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The_Cycling_Girl

Kenzi Menara Palace,Sly wrote a review Mar 9,50,Brilliant stay,Firstly the service was exceptional. I have stayed in many 5 star and even 7 star hotels before and it was on par. Polite helpful and hospitable. breakfast had a good range. Only thing missing for me was baked beans. The rooms are clean and spacious and decent could do with a small update but no complaints. Spa treatments are value for money. Location is good with some lovely restaurants nearby Nommos and Noouba are particularly good. Also quick to and from airport. Rooftop nightclub is just behind hotel which is lively with nice drinks.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Protravellerd
Kenzi Menara Palace,Hans Peter Z wrote a review Mar 6,30,Sympathique old Hotel in beautiful envrionment,We stayed there last week with a group of golfers and were disappointed:    1. The plumbing of the bathtub in our first room did not work properly.  Then we got an upgrade to a view to the pool room:  2.There was no coffee machine in the room.  3. The teabags were not replaced regularly  4. There were no little spoons available (also at dinner you had to search for them - probably there is a shortage...

Kenzi Menara Palace,Jitka wrote a review Mar 3,50,Very nice hotel,We wanted to go for a romantic weekend and we couldn't find a better place. This hotel is so nice and offers everything we could wish for. The staff was so nice from the begining at the reception bars restaurant housekeeping and mainly the coach Mahdi who was a true professional and helped us so much with trips around. We have never met anyone as helpful as him. If anyone wants to go to Marrakech we definitely recomend this hotel.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/532jitka_

Kenzi Menara Palace,LondonSal84 wrote a review Feb 2023,20,Not really a 5 star experience,Hotel design and building is what you would expect from a 5 star hotel. All very nicely decorated well kept clean with comfortable modern furniture. Room was of similar standard very spacious with very comfortable bed and indulgent pillows.    However many things were not of a 5 star quality.  Spa; Service and attitude of staff was very poor. Not a relaxing welcoming feel on entering or on leaving the spa. Reserved the indoor heated pool for an hour but aggressive staff were more concerned about the cost of using the certain parts of the spa rather than providing towels and a courteous service. Was rudely told the Hammam is not free even though we had no intention of using it at this point and in pound sterling it was not really even a significant cost. Shoved in a side part of the spa to change without a door to close for privacy even though at a minimum there were male and female toilet cubicles available. Therefore was definitely put off using the spa services further.    Did make a complaint at the time but this was not followed up until checkout.    Food; some of the dinner 'hot' buffet food items were cold including chicken dishes. Luckily did not experience any gastroenteritis as a result of this. Overall though was not particularly overexcited about the choice of the food available or the labelling of the food. The fresh pasta dish made by the chefs was something I could've quickly cooked up at home.    Overall service; Was mediocre. Some of the waiters were very pleasant concierge was very helpful others pretended not to see you. We had a few issues with our bathroom the leaking bidet was not fixed some towels felt damp and the toilet roll holder was broken.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,london,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LondonSal84

Kenzi Menara Palace,chriscasserly1 wrote a review Jan 2023,20,Did not meet my expectations.,Positives :  Aesthetics very pleasing. Gardens and swimming pool very well laid out.  Warm welcome from Reception upon arrival.  Moroccan Restaurant (surcharge) in my opinion worthy of the five stars the hotel claims. Definitely worth booking our waiter Mahmoud was excellent and a credit to the hotel.    Negatives:  Main restaurant extremely poor hot buffet style food was not even warm. Unfortunately breakfast buffet was no better unless you were prepared to wait for freshly cooked fried eggs or an omelette. Coffee was help yourself from a dated vending machine and good luck finding a tea spoon to stir!! Do not leave your food unguarded as the birds flying around the restaurant will peck!!  Rooms whilst spacious are “tired”.  Too many small but significant details do not make this a five star establishment.  Whilst our complaints were listened to and respected the matters could not be addressed in the four days we spent there.    My expectations were that I was going to a five star resort I’m afraid it did not meet my expectation of five star.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Watford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chriscasserly1
Kenzi Menara Palace,Paul B wrote a review Jan 2023,10,Very poor fist experience with terrible food.,6 of us arrived yesterday on a golf trip. Hotel is really quiet. Almost empty so no atmosphere. The hotel is very cold.    The trip was booked through Golfbreaks . Com. We are making contact to see if they can move us.    We are on an All Inclusive package. Last night the Restaurant for dinner was a disaster. The buffet is cold but it’s supposed to be hot! Plenty of chefs around paying no attention to the quality of the food. We all ended up having a pasta insisting it was cooked in front of us. That was very nice.    Breakfast this morning was the same as last night. The “ hot buffet” was cold. Again with chefs around who paid no attention.    We shall eat elsewhere for the rest of the trip.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Northwood, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W8238XYpaulb
Kenzi Menara Palace,AKOSUAB wrote a review Dec 2022,50,"Amazing food, awesome hospitality, and beautiful hotel",Kenzi Menara Palace Resort is indeed a real palace. I visited with my family over the Christmas period and from the moment we stepped in the reception we felt like royals. The rooms are very large with all amenities needed.  Their hospitality is 5star. We went for all-inclusive and were never bored with the food or the dessert and every day we had different selections. The waiters are always willing to help and ho extra miles.  I highly recommend their concierge services. sherif the head of the concierge has an amazing personality and he is always available to help. His recommendations were spot on.  The hotel is a family friend and i will highly recommend it to everyone.

Kenzi Menara Palace,varsha j wrote a review Dec 2022,20,Not a five star experience. Wouldn’t recommend it for family stays,Our overall experience has been disappointing. I would not recommend staying here especially if you’re planning a relaxing family stay with kids.    Positives  - Entrance and lobby gives an appeal of a five star hotel and the Moroccan architecture is lovely.    - Upon arrival you’re welcomed with a nice selection of treats in the room.    - Size of the room is quite good. We stayed in a deluxe and it felt like a suite with a nice view of the mountains and the pool.    - Toiletries are nice.    Negatives  - Hotel tick marks all the facilities available in a five star hotel but only in name.    - Their reception and lobby area is converted to a nightclub with DJ playing loud music until 11pm official time (was well past 11:30). We could hear the loud music in our room despite repeated requests every night. We found this particularly weird considering there are families staying at the property.    - The rooms (furniture sliding doors phone) are run down and need a revamp.    - We had only a hand held shower in the bathroom which was inconvenient. There was mould around the bath tub with paint chipping off. Also shower screen was not big enough so the floor was all covered in water.    - The staff was friendly but seemed overworked and constantly running around to meet requests. This reflected in the quality of cleaning and the response time. This demonstrates management issues.    - No baby changing facilities expected at a five star.    - The treatments at the spa were underwhelming. There was constant disturbance during the treatment. For manicure they just did the polish change and finished in 40minutes. Here again the therapist seemed overworked.,Date of stay: December 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/400varshaj

Kenzi Menara Palace,Jenny H wrote a review Nov 2022,50,"Beautiful Gardens, huge pool and the most friendly staff!",This is our third visit to this hotel although we have not been since the Covid Lock down. I can well imagine how difficult that period was for the hotel and the staff. However returning at the beginning of November we were not disappointed and we were given a warm welcome and an upgrade to a suite rather just our two regular bedrooms - this was a lovely touch given that we were 4 friends travelling together and the interconnecting lounge area made a nice place to get together. The gardens are immaculate and the pool is stunning. We were all inclusive and this is definitely the way to go here. The staff are so friendly and prepared to go the extra mile if you engage with them. We have to give a huge shout out to Zakaria (Head of PR) - he was amazing always checking that we were happy with everything as he walked around the property ensuring that everything was just so also Mohamed who would ensure we had a table outside every evening and even ensured there was a wine bucket and wine chilling Rochdi who looked after us at breakfast and lunch and Fatima at the Pool Bar & Restaurant who tried to find us a paler rose wine and was always smiling and cheerful. There were many others who made our stay so enjoyable - the hotel should be very proud of its staff.,Date of stay: November 2022,,"Reading, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JennyH366

The service was very good and the staff were very friendly and it felt so good. Also the environment was great in the hotel and also every place I visit in Morocco.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Bryan D wrote a review Nov 2022,40,Excellent hotel with a few buts,Not long back from 10 days at this hotel.    Our room was perfect for our needs and spotlessly clean to boot though I should say that at a time when most hotels quite correctly encourage you to reuse towels for environmental reasons it was unusual to have these unnecessarily replaced every day.    The 50 metre pool meant that at no time did it ever feel crowded. The hotel is perfectly positioned only being around 15-20 minutes from both the airport and the souk.    The concierge Sharif was extremely helpful and with the rare exception the same could also be said for the vast majority of the staff.    The food was excellent in the buffet with a wide array of choice that unusually was not just repeated on rota after 7 days. The chefs were especially enthusiastic about Moroccan dishes and with good cause as for the most part they were delicious.    Special mention should go to the dessert chefs. More often than not at all inclusive hotels the desserts are of the processed variety where they look nice but are pretty tasteless and simply not worth the calories. The homemade offerings here were a notable exception looking and more particularly tasting wonderful so much so that our bathroom scales were clearly malfunctioning by the time we returned home.    Breakfast was the weakest of the meals. It was okay but could certainly benefit from a greater choice of cereals and accompanying nuts together with fish and an option for poached eggs outside of the omelettes and fried/hard boiled eggs on offer.    We did eat on one occasion at the Moroccan restaurant but strangely this was the most disappointing of all our meals. A tagine of just meat with no accompanying vegetables was very odd and the meal took far too long between courses with chairs that didn’t lend themselves to being sat on for such a lengthy period. It was also disappointing to be charged a supplement for the meal which wasn’t made clear at the time of booking.    One star is deducted for several reasons. Firstly we found the wi-fi to be frustratingly poor constantly having to rotate it between the three available choices and often none of these worked. Secondly the DJ by the pool who played often repeated music in the mornings and afternoons would sometimes have the volume up annoyingly loud and I did have to ask him to turn it down as we were struggling to hear ourselves talk. It would also be fair to say that the choice of music often did not suit the demographic of the audience.    Lastly (and whilst I appreciate this will not be a problem for many people whilst on holiday) the gym facilities were really poor with much of the equipment broken and with a woefully inadequate air conditioning system in the two areas.    All in all though a hugely enjoyable stay.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Mayland, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BryanD473

Only room service (charges apply)  No help whatsoever from staff at all.  4 guys on golf break given double beds wow that’s a massive mistake so had to change rooms at midnight.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Bo R wrote a review Oct 2022,30,Mixed Marrakech Experience,Sprawling hotel accommodating and welcoming porters/bellhops spacious indoors. Old dark interiors may be a Morocco thing but I personally prefer bright and airy. Our rooms were on the ground floor and although we didn't have any objection to that the location of our rooms were far from the lobby and the dining room. The walk to and from our rooms to the dining area and lobby was thru darkened passageways with some open spaces. It was rainy when we were there so the floors in some of the areas were wet.    We didn't like that the hotel was far from the sights and the city centre but loved that there was a mall (with Carrefour) nearby. That was a treat.    Thankfully our rooms were large spacious but again with kind of an old dark interior. The bathroom was also quite nice & spacious and I loved the double sinks I liked that there were ample toiletries towels robes. I also liked the fact that there was an iron & ironing board in the room. Things I sooo want were pretty much there.    Unfortunately the breakfast spread was so-so not really very good.    We enjoyed cocktails @the lobby bar most evenings. We were sorry the Spa was always full and so only 2 of us were able to avail of the Spa services during our stay.,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Manila, Philippines",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bo-vwayazh
Kenzi Menara Palace,Dom_dd wrote a review Sep 2022,30,Disappointing,Stayed here for 5 nights. The hotel itself is ok looks very tired and unloved. Room was nice and large clean and everything that was needed. Location of the hotel is fine just 20 mins from the airport and market. The restaurant staff were very polite and helpful. That’s where my positivity stops. The food although a good choice was lukewarm at best no matter if it was breakfast lunch or dinner. The bar and pool staff are clueless. No idea if it is just rudeness or lack of training but expect to stand at the bar/pool bar (as the only customer) for at least 10 mins before you get any acknowledgment. Coffee machine always breaking fresh orange juice always running out beer on tap always finished. Just terrible. If you want to sit around the pool don’t expect relaxation as due to the young age of pool staff they have music blaring out until 5pm and I mean loud. Wouldn’t go back and would say this is a 3.5 star at best.,Date of stay: September 2022,,"Leicestershire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dom_dd

The hotel room was very clean and the staff were so lovely. The grounds were well kept and the breakfast was really nice. Our stay in Morocco would not have been as amazing as it was without the concierge staff Sherrif. He always made sure we were well accommodated and was so helpful with everything. He went out of his way to make sure we had the best stay possible. I can’t recommend this hotel more.,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/291ores

Kenzi Menara Palace,Colin B wrote a review Oct 2022,50,synopsis,We stay at this truly EXEMPLARY Hotel twice-yearly and it ALWAYS EXCEEDS any expectations we might have or have had. We have stayed at a few other Hotels in marrakech in past years but would NEVER EVER stay anywhere else but HERE. Anyone who maybe chooses to stay in the noisy centre of Marrakech ok BUT they will not have the tranquility and peacefulness of this Hotel because after all is said we all wish to go on holiday to RELAX after our hard worked and busy year. The Welcome you will receive by the Patron Mme Jamili Monsieur Cherif (the Concierge) and the Reception Staff who are Always on hand 24 hrs of the day and we must not forget ALL the Waiters and the Cleaning staff who provide an excellent Service and at meal times whether by the Pool or in the Restaurants the magnificent choice and variety of cuisine to suit all types of when we fancyExcellent Choice of delicious food Room quality The Swimming pools and SPA pool are Totally Cleaned every day with Chlore and Ph tested by an extremely efficient and very helpful and courtoise man called Khaled who is also an accredited Lifeguard something 'other' Hotels we believe are lacking in.,Date of stay: October 2022,,"Poitiers, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/994colinb
Kenzi Menara Palace,Bo R wrote a review Oct 2022,30,Mixed Marrakech Experience,Sprawling hotel accommodating and welcoming porters/bellhops spacious indoors. Old dark interiors may be a Morocco thing but I personally prefer bright and airy. Our rooms were on the ground floor and although we didn't have any objection to that the location of our rooms were far from the lobby and the dining room. The walk to and from our rooms to the dining area and lobby was thru darkened passageways with some open spaces. It was rainy when we were there so the floors in some of the areas were wet.    We didn't like that the hotel was far from the sights and the city centre but loved that there was a mall (with Carrefour) nearby. That was a treat.    Thankfully our rooms were large spacious but again with kind of an old dark interior. The bathroom was also quite nice & spacious and I loved the double sinks I liked that there were ample toiletries towels robes. I also liked the fact that there was an iron & ironing board in the room. Things I sooo want were pretty much there.    Unfortunately the breakfast spread was so-so not really very good.    We enjoyed cocktails @the lobby bar most evenings. We were sorry the Spa was always full and so only 2 of us were able to avail of the Spa services during our stay.,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Manila, Philippines",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bo-vwayazh
Kenzi Menara Palace,Dom_dd wrote a review Sep 2022,30,Disappointing,Stayed here for 5 nights. The hotel itself is ok looks very tired and unloved. Room was nice and large clean and everything that was needed. Location of the hotel is fine just 20 mins from the airport and market. The restaurant staff were very polite and helpful. That’s where my positivity stops. The food although a good choice was lukewarm at best no matter if it was breakfast lunch or dinner. The bar and pool staff are clueless. No idea if it is just rudeness or lack of training but expect to stand at the bar/pool bar (as the only customer) for at least 10 mins before you get any acknowledgment. Coffee machine always breaking fresh orange juice always running out beer on tap always finished. Just terrible. If you want to sit around the pool don’t expect relaxation as due to the young age of pool staff they have music blaring out until 5pm and I mean loud. Wouldn’t go back and would say this is a 3.5 star at best.,Date of stay: September 2022,,"Leicestershire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dom_dd
Kenzi Menara Palace,Bryan D wrote a review Nov 2022,40,Excellent hotel with a few buts,Not long back from 10 days at this hotel.    Our room was perfect for our needs and spotlessly clean to boot though I should say that at a time when most hotels quite correctly encourage you to reuse towels for environmental reasons it was unusual to have these unnecessarily replaced every day.    The 50 metre pool meant that at no time did it ever feel crowded. The hotel is perfectly positioned only being around 15-20 minutes from both the airport and the souk.    The concierge Sharif was extremely helpful and with the rare exception the same could also be said for the vast majority of the staff.    The food was excellent in the buffet with a wide array of choice that unusually was not just repeated on rota after 7 days. The chefs were especially enthusiastic about Moroccan dishes and with good cause as for the most part they were delicious.    Special mention should go to the dessert chefs. More often than not at all inclusive hotels the desserts are of the processed variety where they look nice but are pretty tasteless and simply not worth the calories. The homemade offerings here were a notable exception looking and more particularly tasting wonderful so much so that our bathroom scales were clearly malfunctioning by the time we returned home.    Breakfast was the weakest of the meals. It was okay but could certainly benefit from a greater choice of cereals and accompanying nuts together with fish and an option for poached eggs outside of the omelettes and fried/hard boiled eggs on offer.    We did eat on one occasion at the Moroccan restaurant but strangely this was the most disappointing of all our meals. A tagine of just meat with no accompanying vegetables was very odd and the meal took far too long between courses with chairs that didn’t lend themselves to being sat on for such a lengthy period. It was also disappointing to be charged a supplement for the meal which wasn’t made clear at the time of booking.    One star is deducted for several reasons. Firstly we found the wi-fi to be frustratingly poor constantly having to rotate it between the three available choices and often none of these worked. Secondly the DJ by the pool who played often repeated music in the mornings and afternoons would sometimes have the volume up annoyingly loud and I did have to ask him to turn it down as we were struggling to hear ourselves talk. It would also be fair to say that the choice of music often did not suit the demographic of the audience.    Lastly (and whilst I appreciate this will not be a problem for many people whilst on holiday) the gym facilities were really poor with much of the equipment broken and with a woefully inadequate air conditioning system in the two areas.    All in all though a hugely enjoyable stay.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Mayland, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BryanD473
Kenzi Menara Palace,Mark J wrote a review Nov 2022,30,GOLFERS BEWARE….,Firstly this is our 6th stay at this Hotel we come for short golf breaks. We have never had a bad word to say. However this time our experience has been atrocious.  All inclusive now STOPS at 11pm. The bar then charges BUT is totally closed at mid night. A 5 star hotel no service after midnight 3 star at most.  We arrived after after a 3hr delay at immigration. 10.45 pm. NO FOOD!!! Although restaurant on website indicates it shut at 11pm! Only room service (charges apply)  No help whatsoever from staff at all.  4 guys on golf break given double beds wow that’s a massive mistake so had to change rooms at midnight.  So British Golfers beware it may not be the best place to visit anymore. Such a shame as we’ve had great breaks here before!

The concierge arranged for someone to go to a pharmacy to pick up some medication for me....just brilliant  (Thank You concierge - you were amazing)  The breakfast was excellent (was included with the booking...included bacon which is unusual in Marrakech). We also ate dinner at the hotel; tagine which was lovely. The drinks choice was good.  The hotel room was huge very clean etc.  The pool was very clean as were all the outside areas.  Complimentary shuttle-bus to and from the town.  I would have absolutely no hesitation in staying here again....in fact I would definitely return to this hotel if/when I return to Marrakech.  This was the 4th time here and this was the best place I've stayed.  My Partner and I had a wonderful time.  Many Thanks to the reception staff for all their assistance....in fact all of the staff at the hotel were just awesome.  great value for money.  The Spa is very good also.

Kenzi Menara Palace,nigeltbd wrote a review Feb 2022,50,A great holiday with great service,Great hospitality from the moment we entered the hotel. We arrived at 1pm rooms weren't quite ready (check is in 3pm) so the fantastic Shahid from concierge gave us our all inclusive wrist bands suggested we had lunch then returned. Had our first G&T sitting outside admiring the amazing grounds and pool had lunch on the restaurant terrace came back and the rooms were ready. The rooms are extremely big the beds exceptionally comfortable nice seating area big bathroom plenty of storage space safe for valuables and a lovely terrace with seating overlooking the pool. We were a party of 3 and the hotel gave us rooms with a connecting door which was helpful. Shahid gave us suggestions for tours he could organise and we took him up on the Atlas mountains berber village and waterfall - £70 for a private chauffeured car from 1030 to 1600 for the 3 of us whereas when I researched a tour on line prior to coming it was £30 each on a shared coach. It was a perfect tour. Given that there were not many guests (the borders had only opened 5 days earlier) the shuttle bus into the medina was not operating but Shahid also organised a car (100 dirham). The main restaurant had plenty of choice each lunchtime and evening. Whilst the main salads and most desserts did not differ much the hot selections changed each meal. There was also a fantastic carvery for lunch and dinner that differed each day. The food was tasty service great and nice to have selections of Moroccan white red or rose wine sparkling and still water. But if you wanted something from the bar that wasn't an issue too. The bar staff were always attentive and ample selection of alcoholic drinks cocktails soft drinks coffees lovely Moroccan mint tea etc. I also tried the spa twice - they had a special offer at a great value 450 dirhams for Hamman scrub and body massage with Argan oil. The only strange thing was the spa staff did not stay around after the treatment to be given a tip! Clearly it is good to tip the bar and restaurant staff who were all very grateful. Reception staff also really friendly and I exchanged currency there at a decent rate. There was an animation and entertainment team which I felt sorry for due to lack of guests and they still put on activities during the day and singing in the evening.

The staff were generally really helpful warm and welcoming. Shereff particularly was so welcoming and organised an amazing tour for us at a really reasonable price. He made us feel really welcomed and went out of his way for us. The night concierge and waiting staff were also lovely to deal with. Hamsa was an excellent server and even brought me a chair for my bag which was a really thoughtful thing to do. The only drawback we had was the food at times we felt was a bit overpriced and we had an hour or two without electricity though this was very early in the morning so might have been maintenance. Initially when we arrived it seemed the room wasn’t ready or stocked with water and we were very thirsty after the heat it took some time to come and we found room service was often quite long wait times. But overall an amazing holiday a reasonably priced stay fantastic staff and beautiful location. Ultimate luxury and I’d 100% recommend.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Oussama M wrote a review May 2021,40,Great moments,Advantages:    1. The reception agents are nice and gentle  The Main reason for our stay was the good impression we got from the sypma reception man (Oussama) we came to Marrakech without reservation we saw three hotels but our choice was made due to his nicety.  Then we knew the second reception agent (Rayan) also very nice and helpful.  We don't forget the porter (Chadi) smiley and helpful    2. The room is spacious (~55m) and clean  Possibility to have connecting rooms access (for Family)  The Bathroom is big (Shower bath two sinks ..)    3. Two swimming pool are good  1.50m big pool with baby zone  1.20m medium pool for childs and doing some activities (water polo ..)    4.The restaurant is good  The servant were nice and helpful  Many variant choices on food with good quality (especially quality is rarely found on all inclusive hotels)  Thanks to the Chef (cookers) : Tangia meat with prunes fishes with white sauce are delicious    5. The great animation team  One of the strong points of the hotel is the team that creates a special ambiance and the swimming pool organize social and sports activities animate the after dinner scene    Special Thanks to :  Great dancer and smiley emoji Soufiane  DJ and athletic Saber  Crazy and ice breaker Hanane  Oriental and Zumba coach Hind  Beloved by children Salma (Kids Club)  The responsible of team Oumaima  And also the guests that were also motivated    Improvement points  1. Room : The bed was uncomfortable  2. Room : The TV is old 5 stars Hotel need smart TVs  3. Room : Insects disinfection should be done before client arrivals (I have to kill ~5 cockroaches on my room)  4. Food : Chicken dishes should have more efforts to be delicious  5. Animation : On swimming pool activities using a microphone would be a good thing  6. Swimming pool : No Lifeguards around the pool at least one should be available for any urgent intervention especially for the place between baby pool and adult pool,Date of stay: May 2021,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/774oussamam

Kenzi Menara Palace,Duncan T wrote a review Apr 2020,20,Disappointed by hotels lack of interest,We stayed in the Kenzi Menara Palace for the fourth time in 5 years however our holiday was cut short by 6 days this time due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Morocco going into lock down. On the 19th March we were given 30 minutes to get to the airport by TUI to get the last plane home to the UK and in our haste I left my wedding ring on the bedside table in our room only realising when we arrived at the airport I had forgotten to lift it. I emailed the hotel via their website right away and then another 3 times since to ensure it’s safe keeping but nobody has had the courtesy to get back to me despite me putting a read receipt notification on the emails AND the hotel confirming that they had received this. I am extremely concerned that my ring has now been “claimed” by someone at the hotel as management are not getting back to me. I’ve had nothing but praise for staff on previous visits and have recommended many friends and family members to book over the last few years but I will not be visiting them again and will let everyone know what the after service is like if I don’t get my ring back. Management will know who was on duty that morning and who would have cleaned my room after our hasty departure. Good customer service Honesty and integrity are important in the hospitality trade and should be paramount.,Date of stay: March 2020,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Grinder627
Kenzi Menara Palace,Alex D wrote a review Mar 2020,40,1 week all inclusive stay,Have returned from 1 week at the kenzi hotel and we had a fabulous week albeit with one or two improvements for suggestion. The hotel and grounds are lovely huge big rooms comfortable beds and powerful showers. The all inclusive alcohol choice is limited however the house red and white wine are extremely good. The evening food is fantastic with lots of attention to detail however breakfast is poor quality and cold. The weather for February was fantastic and the hotel offers a free shuttle bus to Marrakech which is a great service. The bar is soulless and uninspiring so we would normally like to take a drink back to our room and drink on the balcony however absolutely no drinks were allowed to be taken back to your room! This was explained by saying you can't take glassware upstairs however there are already glasses in your room so I did not understand the reasoning behind this name one person who doesn't like a nice relaxing drink in their room? Another issue was the kids club and how it was still sometimes going on at 10pm blaring out the birdie song in French so you couldn't even have a conversation over dinner or drinks. 10pm is too late and children should be winding down by this point in my opinion. Overall this was a fantastic holiday and I would return however I believe the hotel is just a nice 4* and I would look to stay at a better 5* next visit.,Date of stay: February 2020,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Northampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexdC6556MO

Coffee and Tea making facilities almost minimal we had no milk  Room was cleaned daily again small details like leaving enough toilet rolls goes a bit further  Towel Rack was broken  Shower was leaky  Not enough regular shuttle buses into the City    Having worked in the Service industry in the past I had a general feeling that this was probably a really great hotel initially but standards have slowly slipped over the years,Date of stay: March 2020,,"Bexleyheath, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LondonM66
Kenzi Menara Palace,Graham S wrote a review Mar 2020,40,Not aimed at sightseers,"This probably one of the nicest hotel rooms I have stayed in large clean great bathroom even a couple of reasonably comfy chairs. The rest of the hotel is nice clean and fairly modern. Lovely pools and sun lounge facilities. Lovely views of the mountains in the background. The grounds are very well maintained.    Things you be aware of is that you could not have a hotel near the city centre as there is not enough room so this hotel is built quite away out on an area being developed for ""spa & golfing hotels"".    The idea being you go there not to sightsee but to play golf use the spa facilities laze by the pool by day and go to the bar in the evening (if you do then go all inclusive). It also aimed at business wanting to hold conference's.    Perhaps this explains why they get away with serving poor food. The breakfast was acceptable at best (the best things were the foods they did not cook) and we had one evening buffet which was poor and even more a shock when it cost us over £50 (especially as we don't drink alcohol). As previous reviewers have said you are better off taking the last shuttle in at 19:00 having a meal at the market and taking a taxi back as still will only cost you half of that terrible buffet.    Coming back to my title there was no welcome package in our room. Usually when you get to a hotel there is an information pack about what the hotel has to offer (all there was one about the spa and room service). There was no other information regarding other facilities such as the tennis and the badminton or anything about what to see and do in the city. There was a concierge but all he did was draw maps on bits of scrap paper. I would happy of bought a map or guide book if they where made available.    There is a free shuttle but the last one comes back at 19:15 so is not aimed at tourist but mainly to keep you at the hotel.    As for the staff the reception staff where efficient but didn't seem to care no one asked about our stay we where just another client and our opinion did not matter in fact anything above there job was a bit of effort.    At the end it is a nice hotel but quite away out so if you wanting to see Marrakesh this not for you but if you want to spend the day by the pool or on a golf course and are quite happy with poor canteen food then I would recommend it.",Date of stay: March 2020,,"Tonbridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MedwayMale
Kenzi Menara Palace,Stephanie H wrote a review Mar 2020,30,Great Rooms and Facilities but TERRIBLE food!!,I recently stayed at the property for 5 nights we had breakfast included but didn’t opt for full board.  On our first night for ease we ate at the buffet for most this is included for us we paid 300 Dirhams each! And quite frankly it was terrible it was drip lacking in flavour!  But that’s not the worst of it!  We then discovered the charge of water was extortionate too!!! A small bottle (500ml) was 30 Dirhams and a 1.5l bottle was 35 dirhams if you take the 10 minute walk to carrefour you can get 2 3l bottles for 15 dirhams!  And also on the final night we decided again for ease to stay at the hotel for dinner and eat at the traditional Moroccan restaurant when we realised that there was only one other book in here we should have realised it was terrible.  The waiter had two tables to manage yet he wandered off and disappeared for ages at a time! We were left waiting to order waiting for food waiting for tables to clear waiting to pay! Not to mention he barely spoke English I asked if one of the tagines had vegetables he said yes I then asked if it came with cous cous or rice to which he replied cous cous.  My tagine arrived with neither cous cous or vegetables!  My friends opted for the crepe brûlée for pudding!!! It was curdled and gritty and I couldn’t believed they’d served it!  Overall we found that when we went elsewhere for food it was a) better quality b) much cheaper even when paying for taxis too!  Also a few other things to complain about before I get on to the good bits:  - there is the most annoying member of staff that always seems to walk round asking guests if they are happy cause if we are happy he is happy! At breaking laying round the pool at dinner! He was there!!! He didn’t get the hint that he’s an annoying vacuum!  - there aren’t frequent enough shuttle bus transfers and the walk is quite far!  That said the room was brilliant we both slept incredibly well the pool also great!,Date of stay: March 2020,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephaniehG3799AL

Kenzi Menara Palace,Stephen213 wrote a review Mar 2020,40,Enjoyable stay,My wife and I have just returned after 5 nights at the Kenzi Menara Palace and overall had a very enjoyable holiday. It’s fantastically located being just ten minutes from the Medina and airport and decent distance to many of the golf clubs in the area.  Our bedroom which I believe was standard size was huge and very comfortable. The room had a separate seating area balcony and huge bathroom with separate bath and shower. The balcony door wouldn’t lock but a maintenance guy was up within half an hour to fix the problem.  There’s a little sign of wear in places that could do with some TLC but nothing terrible.  Food was all inclusive and generally very good indeed with something for everyone. There’s a separate Italian restaurant that was very good. Drink on the all inclusive isn’t the greatest - the beer is pretty gassy and the cocktails had little alcohol.  The hotel has two outdoor pools which made for a very relaxing time and a gym in the spa with good facilities.  The hotel also provides a free shuttle into Marrakech that takes just 10 minutes.  Staff overall were very friendly although service in the buffet restaurant was a bit hit and miss. We had a late return flight home and the hotel kindly provided a late check out at no extra cost.  If there was one area that could be better it would be the concierge. I booked a cab for a game of golf and asked for a return pick up only for no one to turn up - the concierge said the taxi driver didn’t bother going back. Things could have just been handled much better if the hotel just took responsibility (regardless of who was to blame) and offer to do something to put things right. Instead they just blamed the taxi company.  The hotel was full of golfers but it appeared the concierge team lacked the basics to help golfers e.g. how far away golf clubs were how much taxis would cost etc.  These are the things that make good hotels great.  My wife and I have already talked about returning to Marrakech and small gripes aside we would happily return to the Kenzi Menara Palace.,Date of stay: March 2020,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stephen213
Kenzi Menara Palace,avagabond52 wrote a review Mar 2020,40,Mostly good,We stayed for a week in a lovely large room with a balcony overlooking the pool fittings a little tired but a solid 4-star hotel room.    Breakfast was great each day and we had the option to sit on the terrace when it was warm enough. We only ate dinner there one night and it was a buffet and just okay - we had no desire to repeat the experience although I wish we'd tried the Moroccan restaurant which wasn't always open - wine is overly expensive with dinner.  Tip re alcoholic drinks at pool bar - if you have cash use that because every time you charge a drink to the room there's an additional 57 DH in local taxes added which you don't find out about until you check out. There is a Carrefour supermarket in the little shopping centre nearby with a good beer and wine section and there's a fridge in the room.  Another tip: Moroccan wine is pretty good!    The pool area is terrific loads of sunbeds and shaded places to sit - there's a small heated pool which was great for a swim first thing (opens at 9) and a huge unheated pool for swimming later in the day. I really enjoyed a aquarobics class in the small pool one morning. The hotel grounds have a good walking path all the way round and there's table-tennis by the pool.    We had a hire car for exploring outside of Marrakech so the free parking was great but we used the excellent hotel shuttle bus in and out of the city centre and one-way it is walkable about 40 mins to the Kasbah. The concierge can provide a map.    This hotel is an ideal option if you're going for a relaxing sun holiday rather than just to see Marrakech and the staff are unfailingly pleasant and helpful.

Hotel tried to charge us 550D for one day all inclusive per person but then went down to 450D for a day.    All inclusive doesn’t include some beers and one of the restaurants which you have to pay extra for.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Josh B wrote a review Feb 2020,40,Potential to be 5 but lets itself down. 3.5/5,The hotel has lots going for it and has great potential to be a solid 5/5 with some simple changes although until then for me it’s a 3 or 4.  Starting with the positives it is certainly a 5 star building with lovely architecture and spacious bed rooms. The hotel layout dining rooms and facilities are all positives too. Staff are friendly and welcoming also.  Generally the food was very good especially the Moroccan cuisine if you’re keen to try new foods. I went all inclusive for my last day to enable me to stay within the hotel and sun bathe this cost 450d extra per person. This worked out cheaper than paying the high hotel prices of food and drink if you were not all inclusive. If not Beers cost around 60d/€6 per bottle and a burger and chips around 100d / €10. Although it does cost extra for certain beers e.g San Miguel and to dine in the Moroccan restaurant it costs a further €10 per person. If you are there for a just few days I’d recommend going into town and trying different food at various local places. The pool was nice although must’ve been 25 degrees at best and for most was too cold to stay in for long. There was however always sun beds available and never any issue getting one. There is also an indoor pool however this is charged about €15 extra to use.    One particular bug I had is that in a time when the world is focusing on recycling and reducing waste the hotel hand out 250ml bottles to guests around the pool. When it’s hot these last a matter of minutes meaning each guest is forced to go through multiple bottles a day! Similarly at dinner if you ask for a coke you get a 1.5L bottle when in fact you may only want 1 glass this means often the rest is wasted! Please think about just pouring guests drinks from large bottles to save the hotel money and wastage! Also that way guests can have the exact quantity they want.    The main negative for me was that the advertised air conditioning is apparently only used during the “summer”. This meant that during the 30 degree heat in the “winter” the bed rooms became rather hot and very uncomfortable to sleep in. I did request on a few occasions to have the A/C turned on in my room although I was told this was not possible. Consequently it took me a few uncomfortable hours getting to sleep each night! Similarly there was a basic gym which had everything required to keep you in shape however again with no air con it was almost unbearable to stay there too long.    The hotel is located around 3.7km from the city centre and within 4km of the airport making it easily accessible and a convenient location. The hotel do a good job in providing a shuttle bus to and from town starting at 10am until 7pm running around around 2 hour intervals this is useful due to the cost of the local taxis for tourists. Taxis have no meters and charge what the please so make sure you agree a price beforehand. This is especially important as the taxis are keen to sting you for staying in a 5 star resort. Coming out of the airport the fixed price taxi fee is 100d/€10 which already seems expensive given it is a 5-10 minute taxi at best nevertheless taxi drivers insist it is far and that the price is 150d! Stick to your guns and stand firm on 100d and they will quickly backdown and take you for 100. Similarly going to and from the medina if you want to travel outside the shuttle bus times make sure you don’t pay over 100d (speaking to locals I was told they pay around 30d for the same journey...).    Overall the hotel is certainty a luxurious option however I would not stay again unless I had air con in the rooms. I would also consider staying closer to the Médina if you want to be in the town if not the location is good for a quieter out of the city location.,Date of stay: February 2020,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joshbee2055

Kenzi Menara Palace,Ed G wrote a review Feb 2020,50,An oasis in Marrakech!,We arrived on 14th Feb in the evening and were welcomed in by the reception staff. As it was late we were told to go and eat first and check in to our rooms afterwards which was a nice thing to do. The rooms are spacious with a moroccon theme and well maintained. With a separate toilet and bathroom our rooms had either a patio area or a balcony depending what floor you are on. The pool area is enormous with cabanas and loungers surrounding the main pool and loungers around the smaller heated pool. Still leaving plenty of room to move around both areas. There is a lovely pool bar and restaurant and a separate hut for towels which also sells sunscreen etc. The restaurants were not crowded this time of year and as we went A.I. we had bottles of wine and any soft drinks/water as required. Food on offer changed every day the highlight for my family being the freshly cooked donuts at breakfast! I don't think anyone would leave hungry as there was so much to choose from. We took advantage of the free outbound and return shuttle bus to the outskirts of Marrakech main Square and had a thoroughly great time pitting our wits against the market sellers. I'm certain overall they won but we did have a couple of small victories along the way 😁. We have had a really relaxing 7 nights here and would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone!

Golf was really excellent and we enjoyed it. Hotel presented as a 5 star was not it what we expected. It looks good elegant and clean. There was spacious and well treated garden. Nevertheless: Spa in the hotel is not included in all in Premium and did not offer whirlpool swimming pool was small. For repair of our not functioning TV we waited 5 days nevertheless I asked daily. All in treatment was inferior we know from other hotels. There was big difference in the quality of starters prepared deliciously tasty and spicy. The main dishes were like prepared by beginner chief tasteless not warm and mostly cold. My husband meat lover was more dissatisfied as me – vegetarian. It is a pity there were no traditional Moroccan sweats which are unforgettable. Deserts were prepared for international satisfaction mostly French guests. If we ordered All in Premium we expected appropriate service. Not only in the Pool bar also in the classic bar guests who can take a drink must go to the bar stand and ask for even if there is no guest. Waiters had a fun speaking together not guest observation.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Reidarjn wrote a review Feb 2020,50,We were very satisfied with everything and if we going back to Marrakech we would certainly stay at Kenzi Menara,Rooms are large and well equipped and pleasantly furnished. And so are the receiption areas large but still very pleasant many sitting groups and lovely furntiture and paintings and carpets. The garden with the swimingpools are well kept with lots of nice vegetations and a nice pool bar serving food and drinks. The hotel is well situated for visits to the city and close to the golf courses on the south of the city. All the meals were delicated presented and there are fresh salads in varieties. Lots of disches to choose from every day. Also local dishes which are very delicious. The staff is very professional and really seems to want to meet the customers expectations. All our requirements were met to our satisfaction from all of them and they even have a Customer relation manager Ms Moroua who was very helpfull. We relaxed and enjoyed our stay and if we come back to Marrakesh we would certainly come back to Kenzi Menara.,Date of stay: February 2020,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/damtjern

Kenzi Menara Palace,Monique Y wrote a review Feb 2020,20,"Dismissive manager, bribe to ensure silence",I was looking forward to my stay at the Kenzi Menera. However things took an unfortunate turn when we realised on our second night the lock to the balcony door was broken. When we reported this it was fixed promptly. However when mentioning this to the manager at check out we found him to be very dismissive. He even laughed unprofessionally when we raised concern about it. Stating they had cameras everywhere and we were not a risk. However in context as women staying alone in a foreign only on the first floor (facing the street). This could have been handled much more professionally. Through simply apologising and acknowledging our concerns. For a hotel of this rating checks should have been carried out to make sure everything was secure and in working order before our arrival. The manager even tried to bribe us by taking of 50% off the tab we had run up. On the condition that we wrote and signed a statement saying we would not leave a negative review. However we felt uncomfortable doing this as guests deserve honest opinions in order to make informed choices in whether to stay here.  Despite this the hamman treatment and food at the restaurant was great. However please double check bookings as the food is not ALL inclusive at the buffet as we were led to believe.,Date of stay: February 2020,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moniquey208

Very friendly staff look out for Hamza In the mail restaurant every evening a bottle of red bottle of white plus water waiting on a table for us! Pool area is huge very clean and very relaxing.

Kenzi Menara Palace,BipulShukla wrote a review Jan 2020,50,Best Place to stay in Marrakech - YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED,- 15 mins drive from Airport.  - Stunning grand entrance & great reception  - Very smooth check-in We upgraded ourselves to ALL INCLUSIVE & got our pool facing room 387 (stunning pool view from balcony).  - Hotel rooms are in the form of traditional Morrocan Riads.    - Best part of the hotel is the heated pool with lots of activities that the hotel staff arranges for the people. Music is played all the time.  - The pool side restaurant serves alcohol food (my favorite Club Sandwich) & ice-creams.  - Breakfast & Dinner in the restaurant: decent    - We also made use of the Spa it was awesome very very relaxing.  - Hotel has a travel help desk - which booked our trip to OUZOUD WATERFALLS. We got a lovely huge car & a great English speaking driver. Excellent day out to the falls. The price offered was very reasonable.    - There is also a kids club where my 7 year old spent an hour when we were in the spa.    All in all we had a great stay at the Kenzi Menara Palace.  Its the perfect place to stay in Marrakech.  Marrkech's one of the best place for Winter Sun as well.

The pool and weather was a bonus when you want winter sun having 28 degrees on Christmas Day was splendid . We took time to visit the Square and Suks and obviously 🙄Yvette St L  very special to me . The architecture if it’s your bag is worth looking into as it has some genius examples around old Marrakech.

The food was great staff were polite and happy to assist including our late check out. Our room was huge and were cleaned everyday and bottles of water were left for us. We stopped all inclusive and the choice of drinks and food were enough for us.    As we stayed in Winter I wasn't sure what the weather was going to be like as we had never been to Morocco before but was very happy to be sun-bathing in December! Plenty of sunbeds to choose from though wasn't quite warm enough for me to test out the pools even though one was heated which I wasn't aware of!    Would definitely stay again if we were in Marrakech again and do some more exploring. Nothing much around the hotel attempted to get to Jardins D'Aqdal but couldn't find way to cross the road haha. The shuttle to the Medina was very helpful though.    The only issue we had was that the plug in the bath didn't work which was a shame as it was so huge! But we forgot to mention it to the staff.,Date of stay: December 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samanthatF4919WP

The food at the International buffet was excellent varied and tasty. With the free shuttle into town overall a great experience only slightly marred by the deeply unimpressive Hamman experience included in our deal. 20 minutes in a warm room with used wet towels lying around was not what we expected based on other hamman treatments elsewhere.,Date of stay: December 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Eversley, Hants",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/61michaelj

Kenzi Menara Palace,PangeaExpress wrote a review Dec 2019,50,The Finest Moroccan Experience,This is a magnificent resort hotel. The neighborhood is just great as it’s a little outside the busy city close to the airport and seems quite safe. The complex is just massive - yes it’s a bit of a walk to get around but that’s what’s so great about it so wide and large of a compound! Everything is luxurious the rooms bathrooms spa massive pool lobby and lounge areas etc. I enjoyed the buffet and also the neat little ethnic Moroccan restaurant with the two man band playing ethnic Moroccan instruments and even singing together they were so good.    However far and away the best quality of this luxury resort is the amazing kind and humble staff. They may not realize it but they were more than just luxury hotel workers to me they represented the true spirit of the beautiful nation of Morocco. These folks work so hard humble themselves so much and all they care about is to satisfying the high expectations of privileged European/western travelers such as myself.    I found myself excited to come back to the hotel lobby after a day out or a day of activities in the hotel just so I could connect with the staff and tell them about my experiences during my vacation. Oussama Hala Salma and Amine were just such an phenomenal reception staff. I appreciated their kind service their extra effort to make my stay as comfortable as possible but the best part was hearing them talk about the country that they love and getting their recommendations of places to see and go. They were wonderful human beings and the hotel should be proud to have them.    I would highly recommend this resort to solo travelers business travelers or families.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Christina D wrote a review Nov 2019,30,Decent but don’t get your hopes too high,I am not sure of the level of service one can realistically expect in Morocco from a 5* resort but the 3 different such hotels I’ve stayed during my first visit to Morocco left much to be desired in that respect. On this particular hotel I suppose one could say that overall it offers a decent and comfortable stay. I was pleasantly surprised to see that their rooms for single occupancy are absolutely humongous!!! And carefully decorated even though not agreeable with my personal taste - but that’s entirely subjective. Relatively well cleaned and maintained with all basic amenities. Food (including breakfast) was barely decent - the emphasis was on the quantity/variety rather than the quality. [And please at least improve your breakfast coffee which is borderline undrinkable... as opposed to the lovely tea making experience.] The overall service by the staff (reception concierge waiters bartenders) was unfortunately rather impersonal cold and on certain occasions unhelpful to downright impolite. The only refreshing exception was a lovely young waitress whom we were lucky to have at most of our dinners. The gardens and pool were admittedly rather fine. Location was OK too - not too far from the center but you did need transportation as there’s nothing much interesting around within walking distance. I did not expect much to start with so I was not particularly disappointed. Next visit to Marrakesh I would probably try my luck somewhere else - for better or for worse:),Date of stay: October 2019,,"Nicosia, Cyprus",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/528christinad

We visited the spa this was great after being on the sun all day it was great to cool down and relax The ladies were very knowledgeable about their jobs and very professional. I could mention everyone as they were all great . But a special thanks to Aziz who without speaking to before our holiday I would never of booked as her manner put me at ease as this was the first time to Marrakesh .

Please ignore any negative reviews because this hotel is amazing. Our room was huge! And spotlessly clean and the maid came every day. Food in the buffet restaurant was delicious  so much choice and lots of healthy options too. Even my 14 year old daughter ate happy every day ! The vegetable tagine is to die for! Waiters are so efficient and friendly always smiling and ask how you are. We left 2 of them a nice tip because they looked after us so well. All hotel staff are very friendly with the exception of a couple of male reception staff who could be friendlier. The pool is huge and always plenty of sunbeds available. Simo the entertainer guy is very friendly and always came to say hello every day. The only improvement I think this hotel could make was maybe to have some sort of e entertainment/more going on in the evenings as these were fairly low key and maybe a few more spirits included in the all inclusive.  The hotel runs a free shuttle bus into marrakesh which we found very helpful. All in all this is a lovely hotel and I highly recommend it if you ever visit marrakesh.

We were taken by coach from the airport and arrived about 10pm and the hotel staff dealt with probably over 100 guests efficiently allocating us all a room and keeping the restaurant open later than usual so we could all have a meal. The roomwas decorated in a traditional moroccan dark wood style. It was a large room with a sofa in as well as a separate bathroomwith bath and shower in. The room looked out on to an open courtyard.

Kenzi Menara Palace,meandubabe wrote a review Oct 2019,20,Weekend getaway,We decided to visit Marrakech for 4 nights. It was really meant to be a short relaxing holiday with not much stress. So we decided to book ourselfs an allinclusive 5* hotel to really enjoy.  So we arrived to the hotel at midnight cuz our flight was late. When the taxi stopped in front of the hotel a guy runs over with a glass in one hand and a cigarette in the other trying to take our bags. We go inside and the receptionist asks for our passports. We give them to him but instead he offers us a paper to fill in in French (which we don't speak) while he continues his conversation with a coligue. We do our best and ask to get the key of the room. Then we saw that something wasn't ok since they started looki g for something. So we finally get the key card. He didn't explain enything to us...we had allinclusive and we expected to get at least a quick introduction. Nothing!  Now we want to go to the room and he is screaming for the giy with the bags. He was probably outside again or something so we didn't feel like waiting and we just took our bags and decided to go on our own. I anked the receptionist if there is something to drink still and he said only the minibar in the room. I said o.k.. We needed about 15min to find our room.  I specifically asked for a room away from everything and not on the ground floor.  So the room was really away from everything but on the ground floor. So since it was 1 a.m. and the room was o.k. and away from the noise I said o.k. I won't complain. But Insaw that the person who took my booking wrote down the room on the second floor. So it was the receptionist fault that changed the room.  So the room was not ready at all. The mini bar was empty. There was one tiny bottle of water. Only 2 towels for 2 persons...  All this was o.k.... but the main problem I had was that the terrace door can only close with some king of hook and it was more than easy to open the door from the outside. So I didn't feel safe at all!  On the safedeposit box was a sign that hotel isn't responsible for your things...so this makes me wonder why do wmyou have a safe on the first place? Since the hotel has the general key for all the boxes...why bother???  Well to be fair nothing went missing but in any case I wouldn't reccomend you staying on the ground floor.  So we went in the morning for breakfast and it was really good and tasty. Didn't like the staff at the restaurant cuz they see that the tables don't have the cutlery and napkins but they don't do anything. So after the first day I figured where they keep things and took them on my own otherwise you can only eat with a hand. There are 1 milion employes but they just stend there and talk to eachother.  There were always just a few plates to put food on. They never heard for a salad bowl so salad goes on the plate.  Food is every day the same except on Friday - ramadan where there is almost no meat and only local food. I am fine with it but could leave at least something for people who would love to have something else.  Staff is just not traind for the 5* hotel. They are very rude and you feel like you are bothering them while asking for something. Also staff sits at the same time in the restaurant and eats breakfast lunch or dinner with you.  Didn't like that the restaurant was full of birds eating from the tables and cats walking around.  One day I came to the pool bar and asked if I can get something to eat and she said that they finnish at 5. It was 4.40!  Broken lamps in the room broken sunbeds broken sun umbrelas pool towels always missing and the guy was never ever there no one told us we can use the free shutle to the center of Marrakech no instructions in the room no info about when and where you can get food with the bracelet... Also be aware...allinclusive isn't really all inclusive. You have breakfast lunch dinner. A snack at the pool bar till 5 (from my experiemces no food after 4.40) and this is it. You can get drinks in the glass if you want a bottle of Fanta or a can you have to pay extra. Mini bar i have no idea cuz it was empty and on the check out day they asked me if I had anything from the minibar and I told them that it is empty...and the receptionist sait this isn't possible. Did you drank all???? I was just shocked.  So please don't get me wrong it is a nice hotel...but not even close to 5* hotel. We paied 800€ for allinclusive 4 nights and in my country this isn't small money. And please don't tell me that this is Morocco and it is the way it is. It isn't o.k. that when you ask for 2 bottles of water that the waiter rolles his eyes at you. I was really shocked and I would strongly reccomend that they train theia staff! I am a tourist worker myself and I would never treat my gusts like this or let my staff treat them like this.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Ljubljana, Slovenia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meandubabe

Lovely hotel welcoming staff nice room clean and tidy maid service each day. Good choice of food I found the drinks to be limited for all inclusive however I can be fussy so no fault on the hotel's part. Lovely pool area although no pool service we had to go to the bar which was fine. There was entertainment at night although we didn't stay for. Used the shuttle back and forth to the main parts which was useful too.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Colin B wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Another most enjoyable and wonderful holiday--Home from Home.!!,Good Afternoon/Bonjour a tout  We have recently returned 17-24 September 2019 from another wonderful stay at this Hotel. <the 3rd time in a year> I actually wonder WHY some people rate this Hotel as 2/3/4*. You must remember this is NOT 'The RITZ The Grosvenor or other London Hotels or indeed those 5* ones in the UK countryside; if one wishes for those then the cost will be Triple and the method THERE is to Serve QUICK Charge £££££ Get the Diners to eat/drink and leave as soon as possible so they (the Hotel) can serve the next Client and so on and so on.  This Hotel is extremely lovely so too are the Staff and the Management. Yes and some of the Staff do speak only a little English but if THEY visited the UK how many of us could speak Moroccan.?. NOTHING is too much trouble for the Hotel and please remember that the Continental way of asking the Hotel for something/eating/drinking is just to RELAX 'Talk' to each other (THIS has regrettedly now been LOST in society now.) Your request WILL be carried out and just enjoy the ambience of the Hotel. Of course sometimes things will undoubtedly go wrong but this is the norm. So to finalise Please visit this hotel if you need to relax and unwind and enjoy a good choice of food and Wine (which is excellent I would add) but if you wish for Heavy Rock Music Loud Discos etc. then choose a lower 'class' of Hotel maybe not in Morocco.,Date of stay: September 2019,,"Poitiers, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/994colinb

Kenzi Menara Palace,brooksvtr wrote a review Sep 2019,40,Short break and loved it,Just returned from a short break with my daughter and we loved it. We weren’t in the hotel much as we had trips planned but here are my thoughts. I’ve been to Marrakech before but this was my daughters first visit.  We will definitely return.    Good  Beautiful hotel immaculately clean fabulous pools and gardens.  Large well equipped room (yes milk isn’t supplied but just ask at the bar!)  Lovely food with a wide choice.  Desserts to die for!! They must have a great pastry chef.  Achraf on reception was really helpful sorted our problem printing off our boarding pass and also arranged for us to keep the room until 17.00 which was appreciated.  Oh and Simo is great too lovely guy we really enjoyed his company #smilelikeabanana    Not so good  Service can be a little slow in the restaurants and yes the food could be hotter.  The taxis arranged by the hotel are expensive. 150 dirhams to the city (plus they expect a tip) yet only 80 dirhams from a local driver on our return.  We had the room booked since January but were in a room by the main road which was often noisy. As the hotel had many empty rooms it would be nice if guests were accommodated in the better rooms.

But the greatest asset of the hotel is its staff. We stayed at the Sentido Kenzi Menara Palace in the midst of the collapse of Thomas Cook a time when people were being locked out of their rooms and forced to pay the bill a second time in other hotels. At Sentido Kenzi Menara Palace cooler heads prevailed and after some discussion an elegant solution was found.

We booked an all inclusive stay. The food was in abundance and mostly delicious. The cooked food was excellent the salads weren’t great the desserts - a dream!  Alcohol was good too (mojito red & white won’t local beers).    I absolutely loved the SPA and the Hamam.    The swimming pool is huge but not deep (1.5m all the way) the second small pool is the same.  I saw signs for kids clubs but there weren’t any kids there. If I came back with my teenage kids they wouldn’t enjoy the pool at all so probably wouldn’t come back with them.

Kenzi Menara Palace,1Lancstraveller wrote a review Sep 2019,50,Marvellous marrakech,"We went to the Kenzi Menara hotel for 10 days from 11 September with Thomas cook!!!!  We arrived at the hotel at about midday. They have their own system of check in but stick with it it works well!  Our room was available as soon as we got there. To our delight we had been upgraded to a suite. This consisted of a large lounge with sofa  2 chairs and large tv. Also had an extra toilet very useful! Then a VERY large bedroom with an enormous bed a sofa and another television. A good sized wardrobe tea and coffee making facilities. We always take our own coffee but this is personal choice. Then a vast bathroom with 2 washbasins bath shower and a further toilet. We did give up with the bath as it took so long to run. It could just have been low pressure at that particular time. They also supplied generously sized towelling bathrobes. We had a large furnished terrace leading off each of the rooms. The rooms were serviced daily to a very high standard.  There are 2 swimming pools one very large and quite deep and the other smaller and not as deep. In the deeper pool there were a number of floating beds to use.  There were lots of sunbeds round both pools and a fairly large number of parasols. In addition the large pool was flanked on both sides by cabanas. These housed large mattresses and cushions. They had webbing across the top to provide shade.  There were also a number of beanbags available for sunbathing. I tried one and used one every day after that. SO comfortable!  The best thing for me was that we didn't have to get up early to get a sunbed. There were plenty for everyone.  We tended to use the smaller pool as it was very quiet. The animation team were great. Especially SImo! Smile like a banana man! The good thing was there was no pressure at all to join in if you didn't want to.  There is a bar between the 2 pools. Never had to wait long for a drink. Never felt the need to tip and all nationalities were treated equally. Bar meals were available here but we didn't try them so can't comment other than to say they smelt good. Afternoon snacks were available in the same area between 17.00 and 18.00 daily again we managed to resist but all looked very tempting.  There was a fridge in the room with a mini bar but be careful this is chargeable!  The dining room was spacious and airy. We ate outside for breakfast and dinner but inside for lunch as it was so hot!  The food was varied and tasty. Ok it could have been hotter but we have found that this is the case in many countries. There is a microwave available if you do want to reheat your food.  There is a large variety of salads and hot food available at each service. The desserts are a feast for both the eye and the stomach!!!  I read the comments in a previous review about how poor the breakfast offerings were and find it incredible. Every day there were croissants pain au chocolat pastries freshly made omelettes cheese cold meats a large variety of fresh fruit. There were also moroccan sausages bacon of a kind grilled tomatoes beans mushrooms scrambled eggs potatoes. 2 varieties of fruit juice various teas and coffee. A toaster was available to make your own toast. Also various freshly baked breads. I really can't imagine what else could possibly have been provided!  You can also visit the a la carte Italian and moroccan restaurants on site. We visited the Italian and this was the only disappointing aspect of our holiday. The room lacked atmosphere the music system was rubbish. The same track was repeated on a loop over and over again during our visit. The minestrone soup was like frozen vegetables in a bowl of stock. I had a mushroom risotto that was more or less one gelatinous lump. My husband's pizza was ok. We had icecream for our dessert. This took over 15 minutes to arrive despite there only being a total of 7 diners in the restaurant ! This was the ONLY flaw in our entire holiday!  We didn't try the Moroccan restaurant but spoke to others who did. They seemed to enjoy it.  The waiters worked hard at all times. Ok tables weren't cleared immediately but if you wanted to sit at a particular table all you had to do was ask a waiter and he'd sort it for you.  The reception staff were first rate extremely helpful and knowledgeable. And always with a smile. You could change cash at the reception desk but not draw money on a card. The card machine in the hotel was not working. We were told that none of the local cash machines were working.  There are a number of small shops in reception for essentials and souvenirs. The hotel runs a shuttle bus to the medina . The medina is quite an experience sharpen up your haggling skills! To be honest the shops in reception offer very similar prices to those you can haggle down to!  The concierge is a lovely man with a great capacity to multi task and fluent language skills.  All in all a truly magical holiday! We hope to make this hotel and destination our ""go to"" place. Unfortunately now Thomas cook has ceased trading we have to find another company that operates flights at reasonable times.  Thank you to all the wonderful staff at the hotel who all helped to make our holiday so special.

The great bits first...good location and not far from the airport with easy access to everywhere you'd like to visit. The grounds are well kept the staff are polite and agreeable. Particular mention of the room cleaners of rooms 249 & 250 has to be made they were fantastic throughout and are much appreciated for their work. The hotel was clean during our time there.    Now the not so great...air-condition in room 250 does not work and though reported with attempt(s) made to fix the problem it never got resolved and the reception staff never once asked for our feedback even if they saw us each day. The breakfast buffet was the same everyday of our stay reflecting a shocking lack of imagination by the chef or hotel management. On the basis of the experience we are relieved not to have gone all-inclusive.    It is a nice looking hotel great optics particularly at night but would require much more maintenance effort and training of customer-facing staff by management to really attain the level that the hotel suggests.    After all is considered would recommend.,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Hornchurch, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaffxtra
Kenzi Menara Palace,reworps wrote a review Sep 2019,20,Avoid at all costs!,This could be a great hotel. The buildings layout and pool are ideal for a great holiday. But unfortunately the first impressions are badly let down by the reality.    We are a well-travelled couple and have stayed in a wide range of hotels over the years…..but this is the first time we genuinely feel we have been mis-sold a hotel experience. This is NOT a 4-5 Star hotel.    And the frustrating thing is most of our observations are simple to fix…..and have been highlighted by previous guests on TripAdvisor and elsewhere. The General Manager will invariably respond that the experience was a one-off……that is not the case. There are basic failures here which the management are either unaware of (insufficient oversight?) or are choosing to ignore.    • Check-in is advertised from 2pm. We arrived ahead of this so no problem with the initial wait as our room wasn’t ready…..but we kept being sent away “for another 15 minutes” and eventually weren’t checked in until after 3.15pm over 75 minutes late. Not a great start to the holiday when we just wanted to change and relax by the pool.    • This was our first wedding anniversary and my wife had (unknown to me at the time) arranged for the “honeymoon treatment” in our room. i.e. Flower petals on the bed etc. This wasn’t done…..but 20 minutes after we’d arrived in our room a maid knocked and then started sprinkling petals on the bed right in front of us. Not a major issue but somewhat spoils the surprise!    • The room was fine in many respects…..but clearly starting to show its age and a number of issues clearly being ignored by the staff…..shower hose leaking everywhere (easy fix….I tightened it!) toilet flush panel falling off the wall etc.    • The swimming pool environment was great…..can’t fault it. BUT if you’re not there early they run out of towels! 3 out of 4 days we had to wait for towels as they were being recycled (washed and dried). This is sold as a 4-5 star hotel and they are running out of towels on a daily basis! The management are aware of this from previous feedback. All the staff are aware this is a daily problem. Simple fix……buy another 100 towels!    • The poolside bar / café…..okay for drinks but the food is very poor quality.    • The food in the main restaurant could be great……and undoubtedly it is a good standard when it leaves the kitchen. But half of it is stone cold or luke warm!  - Food in the “food warmers” is simply not being kept warm we think this is because the water trays underneath aren’t being kept topped up! Previous guests have complained about the same thing and this should be a simple fix but is clearly ignored.  - On one evening I selected the “carvery”. The meat was fine (on a hot tray and under a heat lamp)….but the vegetables were completely cold on plates with no attempt to keep them warm.  - When I commented and asked if there was any hot vegetables I was pointed to a microwave…….the first 4-5 star hotel where I’ve had to reheat my own food!        • If you arrive at breakfast after 0930 you are greeted by all the empty tables being dirty and no attempt to clean and re-lay them. And then if you ask for a table for 2 the disinterested staff look at you like you’re an idiot…..there are plenty of tables empty! So you sit at an empty table and wait for them to clean up around you……and then you have to chase for cutlery. And then you have to chase for more cutlery because they’ve only laid half of it!!    • We tried the Italian restaurant. Probably the best food of our 3 nights eating in the hotel. But still there is no attention to detail……they will serve you with bread and butter but no plates. No problem I’ll just use my mobile phone as a side-plate and spill everything over the table!      There were positives….the pool environment is great and amongst the largely disinterested staff there is the occasional star who wants to give warm and genuine customer service (e.g. Khadija in the Italian restaurant who was excellent). But as experienced and regular travellers (for both work and pleasure) this is the first time we have genuinely felt we have been mis-sold in terms of the star rating of a hotel. And as mentioned above most of these are simple fixes which have been raised many times before which suggests that the management are deliberately ignoring the feedback not out observing the operation or simply don’t care.,Date of stay: September 2019,,"Horsham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reworps

Literally the cases were in their possession from 2.50pm on the Saturday we wer collected at 3.10pm and when we arrived at the airport my boyfriend opened his hand luggage case to take his camera out for security and the camera had been stolen. In literally 20minutes the luggage handlers managed to to steal this without a care in the world.  Absolutely shocking this can happen in such a reputable hotel.    Clearly ammatures as the lenses were removed from the camera by my boyfriend before he put it in his case so the camera is useless to them unless they want to pay a small fortune to purchase one to actually take a picture.    we contacted the hotel immediately whilst queuing to check our luggage in advised by a lovely gentleman in concierge that he would look into it and the hotel manager was aware and the cameras were to be reviewed.  Not heard one thing back since we boarded our return flight home.    The camera has thousands of pictures on that mean more to us than the camera itself.

The hotel staff made our stay memorable a hotel where we would definitely stay again.  Rooms are very spacious and clean with a good size double bed also nice and quiet.  Good size pool area where it doesn’t get over crowded and beds are available all day so you don’t need to rush down reserve your bed like other hotels. With plenty of fresh towel available throughout the day. Pool bar service is good the two members of staff especially the softly spoken gentle man who took our food order not sure what his name was but he’s very efficient and polite.  Restaurant environment is nice with good choices off food definitely enjoyed the Morocco food that tastes delicious. The deserts are something you’d see in Selfridges you want them all. Breakfast nice choice of food and really enjoyed the Morocco mint tea lovely touch served at the table.  Only down side I can say are that the evening at the hotel are very quiet but you have got Marrakesh on your door step and they have a curtsy bus with the last bus in to Marrakesh at 19:00 and it’s not much in a taxi back.  Also the bar at night the staff behind it are a bit lack lustre and seem disinterested in serving you I would that’s my only downside.  Just to end with a few members of staff that went above and beyond making our stay special.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Nigel D wrote a review Sep 2019,50,Amazing Stay,Stayed for four nights and was pleasant throughout. We stayed on Bed and Breakfast basis. Our room was more like a suite with sofas and a huge comfortable bed. The hotel is absolutely spotless and beautifully decorated. All of the staff were friendly and helpful. A particular highlight was Simo who meets and greets every guest every day and goes out of his way to make everyone feel at home. Also Yassir at the bar is incredibly warm and welcoming. The pool area is great very relaxing and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. Thank you to all of the team at Kenzi Menara.,Date of stay: September 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nigeld745

Kenzi Menara Palace,NewsEdChris wrote a review Sep 2019,40,Smile like a banana!,First time in Morocco and in need of RnR in the sunshine with some good food big swimming pool and interesting places to visit. In a nutshell we ticked all the boxes. We were the only ones on our flight going to the Kenzi Menara which meant we had a transfer all to ourselves - nice! We had requested connecting rooms with our teenage daughters which we got so all good so far. Big rooms big beds bath and shower all very nice. All right the decor is a bit dated but you're not meant to spend all day in your room...Food was good - breakfasts especially so with freshly made omelettes and Moroccan flat breads - although the tagines did get a little repetitive towards the end of our 12 night stay - but plenty of salad and meats and fish to keep you interested. Lots to do during the day to keep up an appetite - yoga table tennis aqua gym water polo aqua zumba football - rule of thumb - if Simo ask you say yes! The man is indefatigable and a real stand out among the staff there. Local drinks are included in the all inclusive - beer whisky vodka tequila rum pastis soft drinks juice - and a few cocktails on the menu. We visited the medina the square souks Palais de Bahia Jardins Majorelle YSL museum and the new town. Loved every minute and would go back tomorrow. Don't worry about the negative reviews of this hotel and its staff. You're on holiday be cheerful say hello to everyone be polite to the staff and don't forget to smile like a banana!,Date of stay: August 2019,,"Sutton-in-Craven, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NewsEdChris
Kenzi Menara Palace,Steve F wrote a review Aug 2019,30,Frustrating,I visited this hotel with my partner and 9 year old daughter. We had a weeks vacation all inclusive.    This hotel was advertised as a 5 star luxury hotel so certain standards and facilities were expected. On arrival the hotel was impressive with reception and door staff being polite and helpful. We were taken to our room which was ok - not as booked but ok. Things throughout the whole stay were always ok!    Food - this was always alright just not 5 star. Hot food was never hot just warm. All dishes lacked any real flavour. Food was very repetitive changing little from lunch to dinner. It wasn’t bad just not good!    Rooms - our room was again budget standard. Decor was in need of attention and facilities lacking. Air con was very feeble and ineffective. The third bed was very disappointing it was dirty and had sharp metal edges. Bedding was not changed properly and we only received two towels. The bath shower was broken and the tap fitting again broken. Tea and coffee were not replenished and milk never arrived.    Staff - staff were always polite and helpful in the bar pool and restaurant areas. Reception staff always polite but didn’t do anything when asked so you gave up.    Pool - nice area and good staff. It was always clean and the temperature was just right.    Communal areas - clean tidy and gardens were beautiful.    Location - the hotel was ideally located to see the city but was quiet and relaxing. Only 20 minutes from the airport was great for travelling but constant plane noise was apparent all day.    All inclusive- there’s very little you couldn’t have within the package only the normal things so those that have moaned were being unrealistic.    Language- speaking french would help but really wasn’t an issue. If you were polite the staff were to just normal manners.    The hotel is frustrating as it could be so good attention to detail and some obvious tweaks would improve everything. The food was quite disappointing and general management attitude. You see a lot of managers in their suits doing absolutely nothing watching staff work hard. They were generally lazy not helping or working an embarrassment to the hotel.    I have read previous reviews and hotel management just make the same comments - it is not going to change as they have taken no notice of previous reviews. A lack of interest is evident.    If you get a very cheap deal this hotel is ok do not go expecting a 5 star hotel it is no more than a 3 star.    Tour operators need to visit the hotel to assess it and the owners need to address the management style and capability.,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Hampshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/636stevef
Kenzi Menara Palace,MPB3 wrote a review Aug 2019,40,Relaxing break,Just a short 4 night break at this hotel  We arrived at 7.15pm after a very long day travelling Heathrow via Madrid as no direct flights available. Greeting was friendly and we were asked to complete a couple of forms which we did and then were left waiting in the lounge no offer of a drink. Asked at reception whether we could get our all inclusive wristbands in order to get a much needed drink and why were we not shown to our room. Hard to believe but our room was not ready! I mentioned that our room should be ready from 2pm to which the receptionist apologised and said they were really busy today not really good enough but didn’t want to cause a scene. Finally got to our room just before 8pm.    The room was as expected nice and spacious air con worked fine after a couple of hours of being switched on. Two small bottles of water were provided but no tea bags just coffee in fact only two tea bags were left during our 4 night stay and only one other day were we left any water. Not really acceptable but we didn’t mention it as we were there for such a short time. We just made sure we got water from one of the bars each day.    These issues aside we enjoyed everything else the hotel offered.    The food was very nice we always found plenty to eat and the desserts were gorgeous although we found that some of the desserts went very quickly and were not replenished so if you like something I suggest you take it to your table before your starter and main course.    We normally went for breakfast before 8am and it was lovey and quiet our waiter in the outside seating remembering we liked tea with milk and brought pots of water and milk without us asking. Nice service!    Plenty of sun beds we always got beds without reserving them although plenty of people did reserve them. No need.    The pool is a good size never too busy. The girls working the pool bar are busy all day long and do a good job.    Simo one of the entertainment team was very friendly and always came to say hello each day. An asset to the team.    Use the shop in the hotel if you need snacks or cigarettes. Normally steer clear of hotel shops as usually way overpriced but he is not a rip off merchant. In fact we bought all of our gifts in his shop everything is priced and after visiting the medina in Marrakesh we paid a fraction of the price we were being asked there.    Would we use this hotel again? Yes but a bit more attention to detail in some areas is needed.,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,Eastbourne,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MPB3
Kenzi Menara Palace,lucy h wrote a review Aug 2019,40,10 night stay,We stayed here for 10 nights as two female travelers. The rooms are large and spacious and cleaned everyday although could there could have been more attention to detail we had a lovely view over the pool although the air conditioning could be set higher.  The restaurant had a large choice of food although this was not always hot there was a microwave for guests to use the breakfast in particular was exceptional.  The hotel staff over all were helpful and friendly going out of their way to accommodate guests the poolside staff would always find us a sunbed and umbrella and the events guy worked tirelessly he is credit to the hotel (smile like a banana) It was just a shame the poolside bar staff team were not as helpful.

Kenzi Menara Palace,lovetoholiday2007 wrote a review Aug 2019,50,Beautiful hotel,Stayed here recently as part of a family group. It is a beautiful hotel and the staff work really hard keeping it spotlessly clean. Everywhere you turn there is someone cleaning.    The grounds are also constantly being maintained.    The rooms are large and spacious even with the addition of an extra bed there was still loads of space and the bathroom is also massive with a separate toilet within it.    The food was varied with loads of choice you will certainly not starve and the deserts were brilliant but there was also a selection of fresh fruit it you wanted to be healthy.    All the staff were friendly and keen to help especially the waiters in the man dining room who looked after us really well and welcomed us into the dining room every day so we ended up having 'our table'    The free shuttle bus into the city centre is a nice touch and it's only a 10 minute ride.    It's also a short 15 minute transfer to the airport.    I will certainly stay here again when I next visit Marrakech.,Date of stay: August 2019,,"Derbyshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovetoholiday2007

At the pool bar Charma one of the girls was the main person leading others who sometimes did not understand the languages she should be a supervisor really good.  Rooms were really big and the beds comfortable kept really clean and toiletries were replenished every day2 small bottles left each day.

The day time entertainment by the the pool was fabulous but not intrusive but entertaining. A special mention to Simo who was kind and helpful and worked hard to keep the guests happy.  Also a special mention to Imane who sat in reception and dealt with the photography what a kind lady.  The only down side to the whole week was the daily (except one day) musician in the restaurant area of an evening. His repertoire was limited which made it all very monotonous.

It isn’t perfect but I forgive the imperfections because I feel very much @ home when I visit. I have yet to experience a hotel that is 100% perfect.  All Inclusive is worth every penny the food is varied/delicious/displayed well & the tiny cakes are beautiful - lemon meringue pie & the macarons are divine.  The rooms are large & clean with good air con.  Swimming pool is fantastic there are always available sun loungers & large bean bags to relax in the pool.  The band that play in the evenings are playing/singing all types of music & they’re lovely people.  The entertainment staff are fabulous.

Overall very unhappy and looking forward to spending a day out of the hotel tomorrow.

Staff are very friendly everyone from front of house to pool staff to housekeeping and gardeners all happily said hello when you spoke to them and all had welcoming smiles. We were all inclusive and had no complaints at all re the food and beverage on offer themed nights for the food each evening ensured a good variety was on offer and no reason to be bored. I'm surprised at some of the other reviews stating that the food was very 'samey' as we didn't find this at all although it would depend on how adventurous you are prepared to be us we like to try everything and love to sample local cusine. The pool and grounds are fabulous rooms are very spacious as are the balconies and are immaculate. Just a friendly note to other visitors if you are tourists who expect nightly entertainment in the form of shows etc this is not the hotel for you. There is live music in the lobby each night and the entertainment staff do a great job in getting people up and joining in however there is no auditorium type space for shows to be held. This may be a consideration for some guests to bear in mind personally this did not bother us at all as we are early risers and like to be up and about exploring on most days. I would highly recommend this hotel for its locations cleanliness staff and food the shuttle bus is a great added extra and please do consider venturing outside of the hotel as there is so much to explore and see locally and further afield. A trip to the atlas mountains is well worth a day out as is Essouria and a berber night in a tent. The medina is the old town is a sight to behold try to visit both night and day as it changes so much.. finally do remember to consider you need to pay your city tax on departure it's not much (our 2 rooms for 2 weeks were a little under £70 for the both) but you need to remember its payable so you don't get a surprise at check out :),Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Warrington, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claireyounger

The hotel was lovely and clean the room was massive with 2 balconies with garden views. We had a living room bedroom and a bathroom with separate toilet.  The staff were lovely and often couldn’t do enough for you (this can be helped along with a few tips!). The entertainment staff try their best to get everyone involved (sometimes slightly too much and a little slimy!).  We barely struggled to get a sun lounger only 1 day and the pool is big!    The food was ok slightly cold at times. The chef was good at coming out and telling me what I can eat (gluten free) however I did often suffer from stomach problems but this could be a number of things. The food was quite the same and you didn’t receive enough info on what was available at each food area. It was very annoying that the pool food was only included between the times of 3-5 and apart from this you had to go to the buffet area and leave the pool if you were hungry.    The bar staff were lovely and on hand to get you drinks! All local spirits were included and there no was no limit to how many drinks you could order at once!  We did a few trips into the square and would recommend these!

Would recommend a visit to the two a la carte restaurants too!    Pool area very spacious lots of comfortable beds and umbrellas.    All of the staff were fantastic. The waiting staff couldn’t be more helpful particularly the lady who served us in both the Italian and Moroccan a la cartes.    Very impressed with the animation team. Engaging but not over the top. There were lots of activities to get involved in and we had a lot of fun. I hope they will be here on our next visit :)    Really enjoyed and will return. Have given full marks but two areas they could improve...    Small thing... the mini bar is chargeable. As it’s all inclusive they could just fill it with free drinks to make the stay more comfortable    Big thing... pretty much every drink we had by the pool was served in a dirty glass. Did raise this with a supervisor but nothing changed. It seems the dishwasher is in the back and it’s too much effort to take the glasses to it so they just rinse them all in a big bin and when they serve the drinks there is often remnants of food or old drinks on the glasses    Like I said great stay and I hope they sort the dirty glasses out before our next visit,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kev1982

Kenzi Menara Palace,Travelbuddy033 wrote a review May 2019,40,Mixed view,Stayed here for 5 nights. Hotel is well kept. Very clean. Our room was huge and very comfortable. Only issue here was the tea and coffee that was provided...all very good...BUT NO MILK ...don’t quite understand why they couldn’t provide sachets of milk.  Gardens and pool kept very well. The use of beanbags in the pool was a great idea...but there’s only 4....please invest in some more as they are very popular.  Pool bar was ok...ate at the beach bar just once...not a lot of choice and sadly had to leave half the burger as it was raw....the main restaurant at lunch time was near on empty every day....what a waste. If I were management I would look at extending the beach bar service at lunchtime and closing the main restaurant as they’re seemed to be a lot of food waste at lunchtime.  Restaurant in the evening was ok...nice to have a bit of background music...outside seating was lovely too. Nice to have bottles of drink brought to the table so you don’t have to keep pestering the waiters all the time. However we did find as two lady travellers we were ignored most of the time and had waiters going to every other table and we always had to call a waiter over to ask for drinks. Not acceptable but having been to other Muslim countries always find they don’t like women who travel without men .  Food in the main restaurant in the morning was acceptable as was the evening. But have to agree with other reviews that the hot food was never hot...and to be quite frank I don’t feel that it was quite 4* . Some of it did not look appetizing at all. Sorry guys but you really need to improve your food to bring it up to standard. Thursday evening was meant to be bbq theme...but sadly no bbq ...big let down.  Yours spa services were great. Went twice for treatments which were fantastic but again the decor and atmosphere definitely need looking at. It really was soulless with basic white walls in the treatment rooms...paint peeling from the walls it really does let the team down.  Overall it was an ok break very relaxing.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelbuddy033
Kenzi Menara Palace,Myviewtoyou wrote a review May 2019,10,Hotel director ruined the trip,As a hotel director general - the priority is to ensure the guests are enjoying their time at the hotel! Instead he stopped the live band playing so he could watch the football!    What an inconsiderate moron - he clearly doesn’t understand what his role is.    He sat in a separate room just next to the bar with a group of men and enjoyed himself - no care about “his guests experience”    Typical male domination and created a rubbish boring atmosphere where we had to sit in silence - he should stay at home and have a lads night!

Kenzi Menara Palace,joanne k wrote a review May 2019,30,A quandary of contradictions,My partner and I stayed here for a 2 week all inclusive holiday which we were very excited about. In the majority it was great but alas from start to finish there were issues.    Prior to arrival I emailed the hotel with some questions but alas I got no reply. I asked if it could be confirmed if we had been designated room 303 as per my information. If they had replied it would have helped. The room was on the 1st floor and very spacious with a big double bed but sadly it wasn't for us. It was directly over the front door over looking the car park with no balcony as such what could be called a walk way with clear glass for every one to look through from the internal lobby area. A room we certainly didnt expect hence we declined.  We spoke with reception and were advised the hotel was very busy the only room available was a twin on the ground floor near the pool (a big positive) which they could fix the beds together. We agreed on the basis that the beds would not move and a topper could be placed to make it more comfortable. Alas the bed would not stay together and the topper used was so stained it really was a turn off. It then took several hours several reminders and a complaint to the duty manager to get the bed situatiin sorted more hangers the safe fixed TV working and no hotel guide.    Also we found out on a badly photo copied letter from the hotel on arrival that the inside pool would cost £15 per visit to use!! We have checked since returning and cannot find anything to confirm this. Not a great start to our holiday.    In the majority the staff were pleasant but may need more guidance. The bars and it's stock were never the same each day. Draught beer bottled beer canned beer it was pot luck every day and on one occasion they ran out of gin. It was apparent that there was a lack of management. Also myself being diabetic there was a lack of sugar free drinks only coke zero. We had to buy sugar free soft drinks from the local Carrefore.  However there was a diamond that shone Yasser El Merroni who worked on the bar. We were always met with a smile and every day he went above and beyond nothing was a problem including on our final day pouring us a draught beer which had been unavailable except on 2 days out of 14 yippee!!    Food on the wholewhole was great but often found the hot food wasn't hot and there were no hot plates they had to be microwaved. The Italian restaurant which offered a la carte was closed for the majority of our stay. However we did manage it once and the head chef kindly cooked us on another occasion veal escalope as a special. Well done it was much appreciated.  Sadly the hotel at no time put notices up to advise of the closure which was very disappointing.    And finally what we feel is a point which we can't accept. Haggling is common place in Morocco how ever when the hotel organises an air conditioned taxi and agrees the price to take us on an excursion and bring us back with reassurances that there will be no issues . It is shocking that the Kenzi Menara allows the taxi drivers to then on the hotels door step to start haggling. Thus making the arrangements tense and frustrating. My partner got very upset at this point as she was assure this wouldn't happen. It is as if the hotel is endorsing it's guests to be ripped off. This we feel is totally unacceptable.    Overall the hotel it's location particularly the food and the pool for our stay was pretty good and if it wasnt for the issues we had and there were more niggley issues which we haven't mentioned it would have been a very relaxed holiday. Alas it wasnt.  There is a lot of room for improvement particularly the communication between staff and guests could be much better. Unfortunately we cannot endorse this as a 5* hotel.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Storyteller724194
Kenzi Menara Palace,Julie W wrote a review May 2019,40,Lovely hotel,I visited this hotel with friends and we really liked it. From the moment we stepped into the hotel we were greeted with a beautiful smell of burning oils. The hotel is immaculately clean and 95% of the staff are happy and helpful.    The room was large and there was a hospitality tray. The only thing missing was milk. The beds were very comfortable with lovely pillows.    The food was fresh and there was plenty of choice. I’m a vegetarian but my friends said The meat could have been hotter. However I imagine it’s hard to keep it hot without drying it out.    The only downside is that I would not class this hotel as full All Inclusive but All Inclusive light. As in most All inclusive hotels you have to pay for premium brands but there is usually a local alternative. However not the case here. No Malibu Tia Maria or Baileys copies so you had to pay for the premium brands. Gin Vodka Rum and other spirits were included but none of the popular drinks. They really need to get some local alternatives.  The other strange thing is you can have hot coffee but you have to pay for iced coffee! Why? It’s just coffee with ice no extra cost. We thought we had found a way around this by ordering vanilla ice cream which comes in a glass and an espresso on the side which we then mixed together. Unfortunately on the second day they ran out of vanilla ice cream.    All in all I would recommend this hotel and I hope the management take this review on board and look into the few problems.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Tolleshunt D'Arcy, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/226JulieW
Kenzi Menara Palace,jch21c1 wrote a review May 2019,50,One of the best hotels we’ve ever stayed in.,This is a quite exceptional hotel. Don’t take any notice of the negative reviews as we simply couldn’t see where they’re coming from. The staff are very friendly and helpful and in some respects almost embarrassingly obsequious! They couldn’t do enough. The rooms are very spacious and spotlessly clean as is the rest of the hotel. The food is a little repetitive I agree being an iterative variations on a tagine theme but excellent in quality and choice.  We had absolutely no problems nor confusion over what was included in ‘all inclusive’ which is 99.9% of what most people expect.  The building and decor reflects the moorish theme with cool shaded interiors and havens of sanctuary. The gardens and pools are beautiful too.  In short this hotel is one of the best we’ve stayed in and we shall seriously consider coming again.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Halesowen, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jch21c1
Kenzi Menara Palace,JerseySuz wrote a review May 2019,40,"Great staff, bit disorganised",A group of 7 ladies stayed here for a golf trip and overall we had a great time. The staff in the restaurant were really friendly and helpful and one particular bar man went out of his way to look after us. The hotel is very spread out which it makes it annoying if you leave something in your room and it is one of the farthest away from reception. The pool area is lovely with lots of space for loungers.    Finding the room was a challenge as the signage is not very clear. Where the hotel lets itself down is it is a bit disorganised. Despite giving all the room numbers the night before to arrange for the bags to be collected the next morning this did not happen. Also on 2 occasions several of us found we were locked out of our room which meant a long trek back to reception.    That said the rooms were spacious and well equipped except no English radio or TV. The food overall was very good fresh and plenty of choice.    It isn't a luxury 5* hotel but that was not what I paid for and it delivered for us.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Guildford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JerseySuz
Kenzi Menara Palace,zoeliana wrote a review May 2019,50,"5* service - warm welcome from all staff, great facilities!",Booked a long weekend away packed with fun and adventure to surprise my son for his 18th birthday and booked accommodation with Kenzi Menara Palace. As it was just the two of us going I contacted the hotel direct to assist with my request for a twin room and found Aziz Libourki the Community Manager very helpful. Not only did he assist with my room request but he also arranged a birthday cake with help from Ms Chaimaa also to surprise my son on our final evening this was offered not requested which I thought was a lovely touch.    The hotel was only a short taxi drive from the airport about 30minutes away - less in little traffic the hotel is protected by security at the gates to keep it private and you are welcomed by the beautiful trees and flower gardens as you drive up to Reception.    We were made to feel so welcome by all the staff we came across the bellboys Reception housekeeping waiting on staff chefs pool attendant exchange currency officers managers literally everybody we came in to contact with was so friendly and helpful it really made all the difference. We arrived mid morning and were not expecting our room to be ready until the check in time mid afternoon however we were fortunate to learn that our room happened to be ready early so we were sat down to complete the registration paperwork and offered some delicious Maghrebi/ Moroccan mint tea (careful it’s addictive both my son and I are hooked on it - had to buy some at the airport to bring home!).    Unfortunately due to the amazing activities planned in (dunes and dessert buggy tour afternoon which was great fun and we got absolutely filthy Marrakech surf and snow wakeboarding afternoon plus a day trip surfing to Essaouira which included a walking tour around where we saw where some on game of thrones season 2 was filmed the astapor part both these trips were such an adrenaline rush) we didn’t spend as much time as we wanted to at the hotel as we could see there was so much on offer there and of course the pool is amazing a decent size and was never too crowded. Breakfast offered a vast choice there was something for everyone we used room service a couple of times and also the evening buffets were delicious. Housekeeping did a fine job of keeping on top of our room and we enjoyed great views from our two balconies (yes we were spoilt with a corner room thank you Aziz!) Check in and check out did not take long at all either found the process speedy and well organised.    I would absolutely recommend staying here and would love to return and bring my other son too (had to leave him at home as he had school!) Kenzi Menara Palace deserves the 5* status thank you for having us this early May bank holiday weekend we had a great time!

Kenzi Menara Palace,HonestMan wrote a review May 2019,10,Massive Disappointment!! Avoid if you don’t speak French!,Well what can I say? My wife and I have left the hotel massively disappointed after a 5 night stay.  The hotel is let down by its rude unprofessional and down right ignorant hotel staff.  My French is basic at best but I do try to speak the local language in any country I travel to.  The staff here would purposely go  out of there way to ignore you and serve the French guests before me and my wife!  Slamming down drinks and food on to the table etc. It got to the stage where we would even be nervous to ask for anything!  My wife and I checked out this morning at 06:10 and I politely asked for a coffee or even a water before we left and I was met with what I can only describe as a torrent of abuse from the reception manager angrily demanded “money or no drink”... we had booked all inclusive!!?  Overall the hotel grounds and pool areas are very nice.  Food was ok everything seemed to be cooked in the same oil? Desserts very good though.  Rooms could do with a refresh but overall ok.  This hotel could be very good but the owners/directors really need to give the staff a shake up we are all paying guests and should be treated equally not to be made out to be second class citizens.  For the reasons above I really cannot recommend this hotel to UK guests I would avoid.

The pool area food was excellent quality and staff there were excellent at keeping us topped up with drinks. Food in the main restaurant was of a high standard plentiful and delicious. My only reservations would be relatively slow service during breakfast and the supposedly authentic Moroccan meal (which was a supplementary extra on top of our all inclusive package of £10 per head) was seriously disappointing.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Emma25brighton wrote a review May 2019,30,Very poor service,The hotel itself is beautiful everything you want from a hotel clean and well maintained. The grounds rooms and pool are perfect. The staff on the other hand were so rude at every level. The staff in the restaurant are very slow at taking your orders and often left dirty tables for an hour or so while we were eating. The staff at reception were very lazy and unhelpful we asked where a cash point was and were told it was outside the hotel... great most things are outside the hotel. The bar at the pool probably had the worst staff they seemed very unhappy serving seemed to be a hardship. However there was one lady around the pool that was great she seemed to do everything from handing out towels to working behind the bar I assume she was management as she was always well dressed.  I would recommend the hotel as we did have a lovely stay but I do think the staff need to be more friendly and helpful.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Brighton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Emma25brighton

The staff well where do I start miserable and useless. Oh and grumpy. The reception staff especially are useless. Asked them where the cash point was apparently across the road. Ended up after going back again it was across the road and up quite a bit.

Great vibes great atmosphere with staying guests lovely staff very friendly! Awesome dining facilities! It was a slow check in upon our arrival as our rooms were not ready yet but the offer of free drinks by the concierge Monsieur Sherrif whilst we waited made us feel welcomed!    Dining was awesome! We felt there was a wide variety of food on different nights with different themes going on. It was great sampling of a wide variety of Moroccan food in the main restaurant.    Only thing is it is unclear what is inclusive and what isn’t inclusive. We found that the ice cream at the pool bar was additional and we had to pay for it but desserts in the buffet line was all inclusive very confusing! 🤷🏿‍♀️ We also found that meals that were served in the pool bar were all inclusive but it was unclear whether we had to pay for it or not- I noticed that there were desserts on the menu but since we had to pay for ice cream we didn’t order any desserts and I felt we missed out as we were unclear on what we’re supposed to pay for and what is inclusive. By the time we found out it was too late as the holiday came to an end.    We found that drinks common to you and I like Jack Daniel’s were additional and we had to pay for them but all other non-branded booze was all inclusive! To be honest it was all very confusing and I’d suggest people clarify with the desk upon check in as to the specifics of what is inclusive and what isn’t. It would help if you spoke either Arabic or French as I feel staff might have been more communicative with you if you spoke the same language. Also be sure the balcony rails are safe enough to use as ours had come loose and was only held together by two small wooden wedges that were loosely fitted! I reported at the desk and the manager had sent someone to fix it.    Besides that the rooms were immaculate and my partner and I enjoyed every last minute we spent there! The terraces we had in our room were so beautiful we named them the morning and evening terraces!! The poolside was amazing and loved the music and dancing atmosphere the reps tried to create. There was always smooth jazz playing by the poolside between activities!

Kenzi Menara Palace,LaurenRd13 wrote a review Apr 2019,20,"5 star prices for complete lack of, and rude service.",Dear Staff of the Kenzi Menara hotel    I really did not want to have to write a bad review but after the constant stream of bad experiences which continued until the very day I checked out - it is only fair for me to write a fair review and express my complete dismay and disappointment with mine and my family's stay at the hotel. I tried a number of times throughout my stay to talk to someone face to face and it was only on the last day after instant messaging the hotel that Mr Aziz got in touch and I was able to speak to him face to face about my complaints - one of which about the spa he was able to offer some sort of solution but considering my mother got a blister and it was a clear health and safety flag I feel that this should have been escalated internally! Nothing was done to apologise about the service or the rudeness of staff in way of a goodwill gesture or complaints being escalated. I am absolutely fuming at the amount of time i spent during my stay having to complain come to reception to request milk (!) chase room service (we waited 1 and a half hours for fish and chips and also 45 minutes for a bottle of wine which we had paid for up front!! which got delivered after we had finished dinner pretty pointless and poor considering it was already paid for and wasn't a cheap bottle of wine!) had the service been acceptable i would have spent less time during my stay in marrakech. I am SO disappointed with a hotel claiming to be a 5* and how they have handled this!!    Upon checking into the hotel we were simply handed our room keys and weren't even told where our rooms were - or anything about the services. The facilities at the hotel are slightly misleading and so the All Inclusive package is something you have to select as extra as there are 'standard' room only packages. There is a free shuttle bus service to the town but we weren't told about that by anyone - i get the feeling that if you aren't french speaking or an all inclusive customer.. you might as well not stay there.    I had 2 room bookings under my name and upon check in we informed reception of who was staying in which room one of which was a triple. Despite making an early check in request and having arrived at the hotel for 12pm (2 hours ahead of check in) we didn't get the 3rd bed in our triple room until 4PM which is completely unacceptable as this is 2 hours past check in! When i spoke to Abdel at reception he said the hotel has no way of knowing which rooms will be a triple and the rooms can only be made up so quickly. Whilst I understand there are no set bedrooms as a triple a room SHOULD be ready for check in. Nothing was offered in way of an apology or any goodwill from the hotel for this. Just robbed of 2 hours less sleep!    As mentioned I had 2 rooms under my name and despite marking out and informing reception which room was a double and which was a triple (considering these are supposed to be made up everyday it shouldn't have been this hard!) the hotel kept mixing up our rooms and even though we signed for bills kept putting the other rooms bills on ours and even took a member of our party who arrived late to the wrong room - i'm not entirely sure why this was so hard and wasn't impressed that hotel staff bought someone into our room even if we did know him. Again nothing was done to apologise for this or reasonably explain!    We didn't really request much during our stay and gave up past a certain point because everything seemed to be so difficult! I did my very best to speak as much french as I could but honestly felt like such a 2nd class citizen if I couldn't understand and was even hung up on 2-3 times by room service!    My mother requested some milk for her tea and coffee from the ladies that do up the rooms and when we had returned from our day out found that no milk had been put in our room. Both Abdel and Aziz said it is very hard to accomodate to each and every rooms specific requests however i have never found something as simple as milk for tea and coffee so hard to get hold of! I then called housekeeping and concierge (as you would in a normal hotel!) to ask if we could get some milk but after having tried 3 or 4 times gave up and so walked down to reception (we were on the other side of the hotel!) where I met Abdel. I said to Abdel that I had tried both concierge and housekeeping for milk to which he replied 'it is not their jobs to get you milk so why would they do it?' to which i was extremely taken back by as this was not helpful. He then proceeded to tell me to call room service (the same people that had hung up on me!) and that in most 5* hotels you would be charged for milk - I have travelled all over the world and never have i ever had to a) request milk when there is already tea and coffee in my room b) been charged for this c) found it so hard to obtain! We finally got our milk to the room but the same thing happened with my mother in law with milk again and she got so tired waiting she fell asleep. This was such a small basic thing which ended up in me having to make more than a few phone calls being spoken to rudely and having to come down to reception just to try and obtain!    Again a small thing but in the information book it said that adapters were available from reception. When my mum went to ask she was simply told she'd have to buy it from the shop!    As mentioned my brother in law ordered fish and chips from room service (it's a good £11!) and had to wait 1 AND A HALF HOURS for this. The price of the room service was rightly deducted from our bill but this was unacceptable. The same happened with a bottle of wine my mum paid for at the bar the bar staff were adamant they bring it to the room in '5 mins' 5 minutes was actually 45 minutes later and considering it was our last night and we wanted to have this with dinner we couldn't! There were only 2 bottles of wine on offer from what was supposed to be a full wine list i'm not sure if they save this for all inclusive customers only and we just got very limited options - my mum had to spend £40 on wine which we didn't even get to enjoy!    Lastly we booked in for spa treatments which were amazing but the temparature of the bath tiles and stones which we lay down on was far too hot. Not everyone can handle that heat on their bodies and noone explained anything to us despite us saying it was our first hammam! The treatment itself was lovely but the tiles were so hot they BLISTERED my mother's stomach. This is a clear health and safety issue which i complained about 3 times (once to spa who didn't know what to do and said to speak to reception once to chaimaa who was going to speak to general manager but then unfortunately was off sick and then finally to mr aziz who knocked off 50% of our bill - but this was more because we had a voucher which we weren't told about until AFTER our treatments) - i'm not massively satisfied with the hotel's response to what is quite clearly a health and safety breach and needs to be reviewed!    All in all i did TRY to speak to staff about this multiple times whilst I was there - my stay at the kenzi menara hotel was a complete let down because of the service and stress the staff put on me for all of the above. I would definitely never even consider coming back here nor recommending it to anybody. I should hope people read my review and rethink their stay here!,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Hertfordshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaurenRd13
Kenzi Menara Palace,Alan_HBirmingham wrote a review Apr 2019,50,An Enjoyable Week,Arrived quite early but our enormous suite was ready for us. The room was spotless and the bed very comfortable. Bathroom more than adequate. We were all inclusive and found the food and drinks very good. The staff very helpful and friendly. The wifi is very slow and sometimes not functioning apart from that the only othe very little niggle is that whilst there are tea and coffee making facilities there's not milk of coffee creamer. Carrefour is very near so we bought some milk there. The shuttle bus is very useful if sometimes very crowded.

Kenzi Menara Palace,The.Winefan wrote a review Apr 2019,40,Lovely Hotel – a little effort will make it great,I am a considerate reviewer I have over 23000 readers of my reviews and I take pride and care to give accurate and fair reviews so please read on. There are some very mixed reviews on here I hope mine will help other travellers. Overall I would rate this hotel as 4 out of 5.    The hotel itself is excellent we made a good choice. It is a well-presented hotel with low rise buildings in a C shape surrounding the pool and gardens. The hotel grounds are well maintained with lovely grounds flowers and bushes. Some reviewers have commented on a tired look but I could see none of this is the rooms were in blocks like traditional Riads and were well maintained. We used the gym which was bigger than some hotels had a good selection of weights less cardio. We used the Spa for a treatment and it was very excellent good a good service and friendly staff certainly worth using (for an extra charge). On a negative note the reception experience needs to be improved for to make people feel more welcome.    The rooms are very large well appointed with an exceptionally large and comfortable bed. The bathroom was also large with twin sinks a bath and shower featuring rainfall shower and attached hose. The furnishings were good wardrobe space adequate but perhaps a little more drawer space would be nice. Again I did not see evidence of tired furnishings. The mini bar is chargeable even for all-inclusive and even for water! I have seen One comment I hear others say and I agree with is that the towels look off white and old they need replacing. Our air conditioning did not work so the rooms became hot at night and we faced the road so some traffic noise. In a large hotel at any one time there will be at least one room with a broken shower air con or something. We had to ask for clean towels on 3 days. The point is we reported and it did get looked at!    In terms of location the Hotel is well situated about 10 minutes by shuttle or taxi from the Median or main square 40 minutes’ walk but nothing much in between. The hotel runs several free shuttle buses during the day and the concierge will help with directions advice and trips.    Regarding the Restaurants Bars and Pool they were all good there are 2 pools one heated and one not. The food in restaurants was tasty and well cooked there was a good range and the roast meats were excellent. This was a higher quality than I have experienced on other all inclusive deals Be clear it is Moroccan food so if you are expecting chips and chicken nuggets it’s the wrong place although chips were available daily. There was always a large selection of salads plus meat at least one pasta and rice a spread of pastries and desserts. At breakfast you get fresh cooked omelettes and eggs. We enjoyed the fact we could have a bottle of wine with our meal as part of the all-inclusive (not for breakfast of course)    The main pool is large 50M with a covered bar area and seating and that was nice. Large sunbeds and plenty of double cabanas available to get some shade. Pool towels are provided.    At the pool bar there was a lunch time menu with nice food and teatime pastries were provided. The staff became friendly over the week and I will give a special mention to Kamtar Reda and Abdo who we had a laugh with! A special mention should also be given to the entertainments staff Amine Hassam and Fate who worked hard and always stopped to chat.    So having said all the above why only 4 stars? There were some aspects of the hotel which were so noticeable it became a problem. There were far too many Managers and not enough workers. This was noticeable at the pool bar in the restaurants and especially at the bar in the evening. The Managers would stand around talking and would not serve you no matter how many people were waiting. They would carry on talking and if eventually someone asked them to help they would then order one of the busy staff to sort it. Many people at the hotel noticed and several complained. I will say these were mostly young Managers who simply came across as arrogant and rude. We agreed to pay a surcharge one night for a meal in the Moroccan restaurant and there was one waiter who was too busy and service was slow. Managers would walk in and out but do nothing in the end we left our food which wasn’t better than the buffet and only paid half the surcharge of 200 Dirhams.    The other factor is that the hotel cannot decide if it is a tourist hotel or a conference hotel. During our week there was a conference for an energy company which had its own meeting rooms and the only impact was an increase in numbers at meal times. Later in the week there was a 3-day medical conference which had a major impact on the hotel. The first impact was that a lounge area was closed off for 3 days while they prepared an exhibition area the furniture was deposited in corridors detracting from the look of the hotel. A gala dinner was held on the Friday night and for 2 days prior to this preparation happened to create a dining area for 500 people by the pool bar totally took over the area and some tourists did not like it. It was 2 days preparation for 2 hours of a meal. Similarly on the Saturday night the restaurant was very busy. I don’t mind the idea of a conference but it needs to be managed better either in a separate part of the hotel or as this doesn’t seem to be possible then communicate with other tourists and offer them something for the inconvenience.    What did make a difference to me is that during the day Guest Relations Managers walk around and will engage with people and have a conversation. We talked to the Community Manager Aziz Libourki. He took the time to listen to my comments both good and bad and did discuss with the General Manager and he came back the next day to ensure we were happy. I hope the feedback we gave helped.    In summary a great hotel we really enjoyed our holiday and had a relaxing winter sun break. I have written this review honestly and fairly and I have shared with the hotel. I would recommend.,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Narborough, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheWinefan

However as more guests arrived the service got progressively worse. By the end of our stay (5th April) it was impossible to attract the attention of any of the waiters. The head waiters were extremely rude but the others were really nice. We booked through Secret Escapes and many parts of our package were not honoured by the hotel e.g. 1 free hammam/sauna visit free gym welcome cocktail and 15% discount on spa treatments.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Christian M wrote a review Apr 2019,50,Excellent Guest-Relations-Management!,We had nice holidays in Marrakesch. The all-inclusive food was available at almost any time a day and had very good quality and diversity. Enough to satisfy both meat-junkies and vegans. The drinks at the bar were just ok but the wine served during dinner was good.  The pool area is nice and not to crowdy; it is possible to have some privacy.    But the best the hotel has to offer is definetly the excellent staff. Here I especially have to name the guest relations manager whose english was very good and who was very helpfull with any issues that arose during the stay whether concerning the hotel the city or the country.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Sharono wrote a review Mar 2019,40,Potential to be great,Lovely hotel in great location with curtisy shuttle bus into the centre only 5 minutes drive. Rooms were very nice good size and comfy beds and pillows. Most of the staff were very friendly and attentive particularly on reception. We were given a room that had an adjoining door and while our neighbours weren't particularly noisey we could hear some talking so we asked if we could be moved to a room without a internal door which they did with no hesitation. We had an evening flight so asked reception if we could have a later check out which was also accommodated with no extra cost even though the hotel was very busy. Nice big swimming pool whilst not heated there was a small outdoor pool that was and people were swimming in both. There was a spa and gym but we didn't use either mainly because we were there to play golf. The main buffet restaurant had a good selection and even though we don't have sweet teeth the desserts were amazing. My only complaint about the buffet and it it quite a big one is the food was always cold...such a shame. There were two ala carte restaurants one (the Italian) was not open which we were disappointed about and then there was a Moroccan restaurant we did have to pay extra for this on top of our all inclusive so I was expecting it to be really good but it was only average. The pool bar staff weren't brilliant but I am not sure if it was just that their English wasn't very good so they came across a bit unhelpful. The main bar only ever seemed to have one person working it every evening and even though he worked really hard everyone seemed to wait ages to be served sometimes there were other members of staff including a manager and although we complained he never stepped in to help. All in all it was a lovely hotel I've been quite picky but it's because I think they are small things and it could be great!,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SOSsharon
Kenzi Menara Palace,Willow wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Great for Gluten Free Coeliacs,I stayed here for a week on an all inclusive deal. On arrival I wasn't happy with the room I was given which seemed a little shabby and overlooked the carpark. I was immediately given a much nicer poolside room without any problem. The staff are all friendly well trained and polite. The Hotel was immaculately clean and well maintained. We did not try any restaurants apart from the all inclusive. This was exceptional with an excellent choice and range of food. When I advised the Chef that I was Coeliac he took time every night to talk me through which dishes I could have (most of them) - he was knowledgeable and made a real difference to my stay with his courteous manner. The kitchen baked a Gluten Free roll for me every night. I was completely well all week and would recommend it to anyone who has Coeliac - you can eat here with confidence (and I was nervous!). The seating around the pool is plentiful and comfortable towels are provided for the chairs and entertainment/music makes things jolly. The all inclusive wine was excellent and we were given sealed bottles of water whenever we wanted them. The Concierge was fantastically helpful gave us good advice booked all the trips we wanted and ensured we had trustworthy drivers. The Hotel minibus took us into the town regularly and was very comfortable. The bedroom and bathroom were excellent - spacious immaculate and well furnished. This is a lovely Hotel and I will definitely be returning for more delicious food and relaxation.

Great quality and variance and a super dessert table. The staff in the restaurant is very attentive and were a good charm.  We aren't into animation and sports activities but still the animation team did a good job of making us feel comfortable around the pool area and small talks at night in the bar!  I can say some things have changed for better (buffet-restaurant) and some services were downgraded (Service around pool bar and pool deck.) compared to our last stay 2 years ago.

The main pool is cold and not heated but there’s another smaller pool that is heated. We lounged in the oversized pool chairs that kept you cool in the 85 degree temperatures.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Karen E wrote a review Mar 2019,40,Good relaxing base,We stayed for a week all inclusive the hotel was very clean & generally well kept.with lovely gardens. Most guests were French/Moroccan with a few German & British. There is some difficulty at times being understood when speaking English but this was never a big problem. The food was good - there is a main buffet restaurant that serves all meals & has themed evenings there is also traditional Moroccan Italian and pool bar restaurants. The Moroccan is an extra 100DH (about £9.00) pp. There was confusion whether the Italian had a supplement but we went & it is just 3 main course dishes on the menu that have a supplement of around 850Dh but there is plenty of choices available with no supplement. You have to book for each of these restaurants by 18.00pm. All drinks are included at the speciality restaurants if you are AI. The pool bar is great for lunch & has a menu with prices on but if you are AI you don't need to pay. There is a shuttle to the medina about every 2-3 hours between 10am - 7pm - also it tends to leave early- we turned up at 11.50 to catch the 12.00 & it had already gone- we complained to the doorman & after some discussion & much looking at their watches he & the concierge put us in a taxi & paid the driver- beware though as when we came back the shuttle bus again left the pick up point 10-15 minutes early.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Carly C wrote a review Mar 2019,30,Review - March 2019,Positives    1. Cleanliness is 10/10. The hotel was kept exceptionally clean at all times. This includes rooms public areas and the pool.  2. Location is perfect. Just a short complimentary shuttle from the town.    Improvements    1. Food and beverage.    This was our biggest issue. Food offering is poor in the buffet restaurant and at the pool bar. Food is left out for too long. Bread is stale and meat left to go so dry and hard it becomes inedible. The food offering in the buffet restaurant is more about quantity than quality and thus needs to change. I would suggest having less options of food and make them better quality.  2. The food is left out to get cold.  3. You are charged for Milk in the room which is very bizarre.  4. In the pool bar food is often left on the pass for at least 2 minutes and when I have sat waiting for my food I have seen birds flying and pecking away at it before it’s taken out.  5. More options on the Menu are required in the Moroccan restaurant especially as you’re paying a supplement to eat in there.  6. Why are all inclusive left with a minimal menu in the pool bar offering compared to those who aren’t all inclusive. We should be able to eat if the whole menu not a reduced menu. Only one option of wines is not ok for what we paid for all inclusive. One red white rose and one option of spirits was not what was described to us and this was disappointing.  7. The Italian restaurant was closed 3 of the 6 nights we stayed at the hotel which meant that we had to eat in the buffet restaurant which was a much poorer quality restaurant. Again this was something that wasn’t advised prior.  8. Staff were seen daily playing on their phones and eating crisps behind reception during check-in. This was highly unprofessional.  9. Pool bar staff were reluctant to say hello for good morning until addressed by guests and seem disgruntled having to speak English. You would rarely get a ‘Thank you’. They seemed more friendly to the French guests than to the English.  10. When departing the hotel we asked to pay our room bill at 1030am to avoid queues. We were told “NO!”. This I found very strange. After working in hotel for seven years and staying in many hotels never have I been told that I can’t pay my room bill when I want to.  11. You are CHARGED for ironing which is totally unacceptable.  12. In the Bar I asked for a pineapple juice and was told they didn’t have any so he gave me apple juice without even advising me of this and made absolutely no attempt to find pineapple juice. It was lazy like the staff couldn’t be bothered.    1. Maintenance - glasses are plastic and often chipped and cracked. I was served wine in a chipped glass on more than one occasion in the main hotel bar.  2. The shower was blocked and was quickly amended. The shower soap holder came away from the wall and wasn’t replaced. Our terrace had a broken slab and used glasses were left for a day or two before housekeeping took them away.    We feel this hotel is a 3 star hotel and needs real attention to detail to really be a good quality four star hotel. It’s average at best. Better food offerings and some TLC are required to keep this hotel’s 4 stars. The customer service is mediocre.    We wouldn’t return or recommend to family or friends.    The above was advised to management by the pool on day 4 of our holiday.,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChandlerCarly
Kenzi Menara Palace,Lucy Billings wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Great Hotel,Just returned from a week stay at the Kenzi Menara Palace and had the most wonderful time. Prior to going I'd read some of theses reviews and was a little apprehensive. Please ignore as this is a great hotel with brilliant staff (yes there are areas of dark deco and scruffs + areas of tiredness but overall the positives outweigh the negatives and people should judge on Morroccon standards).  The hotel grounds/gardens are beautiful. It's situated about 35 minutes walk from the main square (we did walk it) 10 minutes by car. The free shuttle runs every couple of hours or its about 50 Durham by taxis. We visited the square in the mornings and one evening. It's a brilliant place to buy local goods and people watch. Look out for the Snakes and monkeys.!!!  Our room was massive great bathroom and big comfortable bed. The maids visited every day. Our room overlooked the poolthe rooms on the otherside were bigger but looked out onto the road.  The food in the hotel was great loads of healthy choices saladsmeats fresh bread fruitetc. The booze is local and fine. We visited end Feb/March the weather was great + a brilliant option if your looking for a bit of winter sun.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Paul B wrote a review Mar 2019,40,Could be 5 star with a few improvements,Beauiful hotel with lots of character painting and Moroccan influences.  Staff are excellent especially sharmina at the guest relations desk.  Bedrooms are large with a great bathroom.  Bed comfy and clean linen.  Great pool room view which you need as from the front of the hotel the right hand wing looks on to a busy road we did have room 376 but it was to noisy so requested a move and there was no problem all taken care of.  Buffet food is very good with good quality produce great job chef.  We went to the Moroccan night themed restaurant extra £10.00 each the room was great but only 2 choices of starter and main which was disappointing.  Service was good.  In your room you pay for all mini bar items that includes milk for coffee so fetch plenty off the plane.  Only certain lagers wines and spirits are all included.  Stork lager 4.7% taste very good.  You have to pay for a ice bucket if required for your room.  Good size balcony for sun in the afternoon you need the left wing looking from the front of the hotel we are in room 233.  Only our second day so not been into Marrakech yet but looking forward to it.  We have had a walk around outside there is a large CARR four supermarket and shopping complex if you have a cold morning.  Hot until 6.30pm so long days sunbathing.  The large pool is icy cold the small pool is barable.  Pool bar food ok for a snack.    Overall the hotel is very good and clean staff excellent just the small things that could be easily improved for that 5 star status it deserves.

Kenzi Menara Palace,brianreeve wrote a review Feb 2019,50,HIGHLY RECCOMENDED,One of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. The grounds are spacious and immaculate. Being out of season there were ample sunbeds. The free issue towels were excellent. In addition there are many secluded shaded areas to escape from the sun We were upgraded to a suite amazing space and furnishings but understand the standard rooms are of a very high standard Free WI FI throughout the complex is excellent. Food is good  not spectacular. The choice of salads is amazing as is the vast array of delicious puds. Main dishes not very exciting  but there was always something tasty. Above all it is the level of service which is superb. Nothing is too much trouble every request is met with a smile and efficiency. the room service is perfect. It is hard to single any one out but the service at reception was outstanding also a special thanks to the waiter ALI.

Kenzi Menara Palace,tassieBerlin wrote a review Feb 2019,40,Spacious and green.,About 10 minutes drive from the edge of the medina and close to the airport this spacious hotel offered us with a large and clean ground-floor room with terrace seating. The planted grounds surrounded the hotel main pool and small heated pool. Shaded day-beds sunloungers and outdoor chairs provided areas in the sun and shade. A free shuttle-bus went to the Medina several times a day. There was also a spa centre on site.  The breakfast buffet catered for many cultural tastes until 10:30 and was buzzing most of the time due to the number of guests. Unfortunately only instant coffee was provided. There were a couple of restaurants providing evening meals in the hotel.  Many guests were here on all inclusive holidays. The wifi was good in the room but struggled around the pool. The staff were fairly friendly.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,berlin,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tassieBerlin
Kenzi Menara Palace,hisarphill wrote a review Feb 2019,50,Fantastic place to unwind,We stayed for a week mid February the flight being a little over 3 hours from Uk and the transfer from the Airport 15 mins make this an ideal Sunshine getaway.  The hotel is spotless the staff friendly and polite and there’s plenty of space.  Our room was massive and really felt like we were spoiling ourselves.  It’s a short trip to the centre of town by the free shuttle bus we were thankful of the advice and hand drawn map provided by the Concierge. A little local knowledge gets you a long way. Most staff speak Arabic and excellent French we could get by easily but once the staff realised we were English most wanted to speak English as it was good practice. Can’t really understand where bad reviews come from. Coming from a big City I found the place very peaceful and relaxing.... I’ve said the Airport transfer was short so yes planes do take off and fly over.. might be a consideration if that would bother you. Oh yes we will be back.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Leeds,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hisarphill
Kenzi Menara Palace,LordKixley wrote a review Feb 2019,20,‘Don’t go there!’,I really don’t know where to begin.    It’s not very often that I am lost for words.    Do I start with the ants? Or the 200 metre walk down the hotel entrance road following the concierge who was pushing our cases on a trolley in the afternoon heat to the entrance of the hotel where 10 taxis stood waiting in a line? The lack of basic utensils? Being offered a minuscule plastic ice cream spoon to eat my dessert? The smell of cigarette smoke that permeated throughout the reception and bar area?    Don’t get me wrong there were some positives like the way some of the issues were addressed by the duty manager and the very helpful concierge but overall we felt this had to be one of the poorest hotels we have ever stayed in given the star rating on which they are marketed.    Let me begin.    Visited Marrakesh with my wife and 11 year old daughter for 4 nights in February half term. We normally go for a cold city break but thought we’d go for this vibrant North African city on the basis we could see the city and enjoy the warm weather by the pool in between sightseeing. Hence the location of this hotel is just outside the old town but has a regular shuttle bus to get you to and from the Medina area.    I should add that we were only staying on a bed and breakfast basis not on an all inclusive tariff like the majority of the wrist band wearing guests.    Arriving at the flash modern airport was interesting. We had prebooked a transfer with BA holidays and were glad we had as I have to say the taxi rank looked a little shambolic to say the least. I would recommend you do this for your own safety and peace of mind especially if you have children.    The first impressions of the hotel on arrival were quite positive. A welcome drink in reception a roll up bed already in the room for our daughter at no extra cost. So looking good at this stage.    Room    The ground floor room we had was big and in traditional Moroccan style with those intense and somewhat depressing dark brown colours. Huge bed tiled floor with a couple of well worn rugs. Big smart TV with numerous overseas channels. Although only a couple of English speaking. Well what do you expect? You are in Africa!    The bathroom had a small bath shower and two sinks. There was a toilet and bidet off it. A good size but very tired and poorly maintained. Horrible mold and dark stains around the shower. The bath took an age to fill.    On the second day we noticed ants in the room. Around 500 running up the one side of the floor. It was like the Marrakesh M1. I telephoned reception and told them at 3pm I asked them to sort it whilst we were at the pool. Unfortunately when we returned at 6pm nothing had happened at all. Well apart from there was now around 1000 with a huge nest under the curtain by the patio door.    I immediately went to reception to complain. I vented my frustration and the manager offered an ‘upgrade’ to a first floor room with a pool view. I went to see what it was like and could see it was exactly the same as our existing room albeit it was on the next floor overlooking the main swimming pool. I really had no alternative but to accept it as the alternative was to spend two more nights in what was a manky room filled with ants.    On the way to the room the manager told me that in Morocco to be visited by ants is considered lucky! I said I’d really rather not be blessed in this way thank you very much!    We repacked our bags and moved all our stuff to literally the other side of the hotel to the new room. The move of room had now eaten well into our evening and it was getting late for us to get out for a meal. Just at we were leaving our new room my wife took a walk out on to the balcony to admire the view. It was then we realised that the patio door wouldn’t lock. Naturally we called out the manager who after trying to lock it for 10 minutes realised it was broken. So we had to leave the room with a faulty patio door which luckily they managed to fix whilst we were out.    We did think at this point ‘why is everything so difficult?’    Complimentary dinner    On the way out the hotel that evening I expressed my dissatisfaction with the manager Noureddine Achehboune and asked him how he intended to compensate us for all our wasted time. Thankfully and to be fair he awarded us a complimentary free dinner at the international buffet on our last night. Fair play at least he actually acknowledged the hotels deficiencies. He also allowed us to stay in our room until 4pm on the last day at no extra cost for which we were extremely grateful.    Room amenities    There was a half full minibar simply stocked with soft drinks. There was tea and coffee making facilities but without any facilities for milk. Obtaining milk was like trying to get hold of gold dust. I asked for milk at the bar in order that I could make a cup of tea in the room. I got charged 30DH for a glass of milk around £2.50. On reflecting I complained the next day and it was refunded. Well they told me it had been until I came to settle the bill and I had to have the same argument all over again. My wife also tried to obtain some milk from room service the next day and had the same battle. Crazy I guess it was because we weren’t all inclusive guests.    Bar area    Visited the first night and couldn’t believe how much smoke there was around the place. Appreciate that there aren’t any smoking laws in Morocco but surely they need to be aware of the culture and consider the customs in the other countries of the world where such laws are now common place. We never sat in that area and ended up not drinking in the hotel post dinner. It was a horrible environment which was a shame as there was entertainment on in that area for three of our four nights.    Pool area    This was okay if a little tired. The big pool wasn’t heated and so remained empty while we were there whereas the small pool was heated with all loungers taken the minute we had a spot of sun. The table tennis area was poor with no decent bats or balls even when I asked at the pool bar. They looked at me blankly.    There were no towels when we went to the pool on our second day at 3pm. We had to wait for 15 minutes whilst they got some more. Some of the sun umbrellas were also broken.    Breakfast and dining in the International Restaurant    Breakfast was generally okay with quite a good selection of international food with an egg and pancake station. But simple things like having enough bowls cups plates spoons and generally being aware of being polite to guests was missing. One manager Ali was particularly short with me when I asked for some cold milk (here we go again) with my tea. Truly shocking the way he talked to people.    We only ate at the international buffet restaurant but found the food to be of a good quality. We could hear a few of the guests moaning that the desserts were getting somewhat repetitive night after night but to be honest we had no complaints apart from when they ran out of cutlery and I was offered a small plastic ice cream type spoon to eat my dessert with. Incredible!    Another thing we noticed was when we were shown to our table and there was bird mess on the top of two chairs. The table had been laid for guests but no one had thought to clean up what was an obvious mess right in front of their eyes.    Trips    The concierge a chap called Sharif was excellent in recommending a driver and putting together a day trip for four hours. Although watch out that a number of the attractions have entrance fees of around 70DH for an adult and 30DH for a child under 12. He was very helpful and friendly if not a little brusque at times. He just needs to understand that all visitors in Marrakesh for the first time are struggling with some of the local do’s and don’t’s. Don’t get me wrong this guy is the hotel’s jewel in the crown. He is in a different league to some of the other staff.    Other important things to note    We were charged two daily taxes at the hotel totalling 57DH per day. We were told this was the government tax. You just need to be aware of this.    You cannot take Moroccan currency into the country (DM) so you need to exchange your pounds at the airport on arrival. This is straightforward enough.    However the position is not so easy on your return flight. Incredibly once you have gone through customs in the airport there is no bureau airside to change it back. We discovered this to our cost. Also in the duty free zone goods were principally for sale in euros with the only items you can buy being either Moroccan alcohol or Moroccan goods. Some sandwich selling food shops will accept DH but if you have £50 like we did that’s a lot of food that you don’t necessarily want to buy. So don’t get caught out and make sure you exchange any remaining local DH at the bureau in the check in desk area before you go through customs.    The Finale    Finally I have to say thank you to Noureddine Achehbone the manager who helped put things right. The purpose of this review is not to criticise for criticisms sake but to warn other potential guests what this hotel is really like. It’s a top 3 star at best and that’s being generous.    So the finale. We need to leave at 4pm to get to the airport in good time. I ask whether I need to book a taxi in advance? ‘No just turn up there is a long line of taxis you will get one immediately’ I am told. So I’m thinking fine no worries.    We get to the concierge desk. Wait whilst a woman sorts out her lost shawl from an earlier camel ride with the concierge. Then he says ‘yes taxi please go and wait in reception’. He helps us move our bags. We wait. Five minutes pass. He notices that we are looking anxiously at our watches.    ‘Five minutes’ he says. Then after a couple of minutes he says ‘it’s here!’    He grabs our bags puts them on a trolley and starts heading out the door. We follow him thinking the taxi will be just outside the front door. No he’s now 10 metres ahead of us in the blistering heat heading towards the car park. Is he going to a car? No he’s now out of the car park walking with the trolley down the main road out of the hotel. He’s heading towards the gates! We’ve now walked approximately 200 metres. Where’s he going? we’re thinking. Then we go out the hotel gates onto the main dual carriageway and there parked on the main road are around 10 taxis all waiting. The taxis are empty as all the drivers are having a smoke on the wasteland across the road waiting for business.    We look at each other bemused. He shares a joke with the taxi drivers and we are bundled into a taxi with one seatbelt (which I give to my daughter). I sit in the back of this small hatchback hoping I don’t end up like a smashed up pizza on the windscreen.    That my readers is customer service at a whole new level.    Holidays are supposed to be pleasurable hassle free experiences. Something you look forward to enjoy and talk about for years to come. You are the guests. You’ve paid for it. Without us these places wouldn’t exist. The customer is always right if you understand where I’m coming from. In the service industry the customer is king. You are there to be looked after taken care of and made to feel special. It’s as simple as that. End of.    We’ve now been to 54 countries and stayed in numerous hotels around the globe but the Kenzi Menari Palace will live on in our memories for many years to come. But not for the right reasons.

Kenzi Menara Palace,beth101xxx wrote a review Feb 2019,50,Ideal January get away from the British weather,Where to start with this hotel - admittedly our stay was ten times more enjoyable because the hotel was very quiet which meant we were totally waited on hand and foot and the freindly and attentive staff couldn't do enough for us.  Our room was basic although the bed was massive and it was spotlessly clean we had a terrace which looked onto a garden also nice and quiet.  The food is amazing - the breakfast wasn't for us only because it was difficult for us to find something rather savoury that we liked but the lunches and dinners are beautiful.  The smaller outdoor pool is heated - a god send in January because it was chilly (sunny though) up until about 12.30pm and then the sun was booming for hours until about 6.30pm  The drinks are great no complaint the cocktails are sugary but we got round that.  I don't think I would recommend to people with young children especially in summer the temp goes up to 45 degrees which would be far too much in my opinion for young children - although they do have a kids club there's no beach in Marrakech and Jma Al Fnaa square is a ten minute drive in the hotel shuttle the square is also not child friendly (still my opinion) it's unbelievably but it's defo a sight with the snakes monkey's etc.  The Moroccan people are very nice they rely heavily on tourism and so they try hard to make everything enjoyable be aware though they will expect a coin or two for directions so prepare to tip.  Some people are kind but also poor.,Date of stay: January 2019,,"Rochdale, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beth101xxx

Some people just find fault with everything. I travelled with my SUPERWIFE and two good friends - Steve & Bernie. Steve can be a bit of a moaner and he didn't complain here so that was nice! Anyway I would totally agree with reviewer Babyb that Marrakesh is totally ruined by Morrocan Airport Control who insist on making you stand in line feeling like criminals for over an hour to clear control. This would put me off going back - really really annoying.  Anyway back to the hotel.  Smooth check in  Nice Large en-suite Bedrooms well appointed with massive comfy bed.  All inclusive food - good selection  All inclusive beers & spirits - great  Choice of two lovely outdoor pools - one freezing & and one heated. You know the one I went for!  Good entertainment in the bar area - very talented singers  Overall we found the management & staff to be very accommodating and the hotel is perfect for a visit to Marrakesh. We stayed for 4 nights and then moved into a Riad in the Medina just to experience the culture.  On our departure day form Marrakesh after a visit to the Ourika Valley we called back to the Kenzi Menara for a final drink. This wasn't All Inclusive anymre and the cost was over 20 euro for for drinks. So if your going to stay - book the All Inclusive as it's really well worth it  Would I go back?

Kenzi Menara Palace,K.P-D wrote a review Jan 2019,50,Wonderful stay!,We had a lovely stay at Kenzi Menara Palace. We were there for a week. We are a family of seven and stayed in two rooms. We originally booked a quad and a triple room but when we arrived we were given a free upgrade to two suites - a pleasant surprise!    The hotel itself is beautiful. The decor in the lobby is lovely the large gardens are well maintained and the view overlooking the Atlas Mountains is amazing.    The staff were very welcoming and friendly. We were greeted by Serife who has a great sense of humour and made us feel immediately welcome. A very big thank you to the community manager Aziz who was very attentive and helpful throughout our stay. He was always ready to help us and answer any questions we had. He is an asset to the hotel.    The suites were spacious clean and comfortable but the extra folding beds for the children were disappointing. The complementary bottled water provided in the rooms was a nice touch. There were bathrobes slippers and plenty of towels in the room.    The facilities throughout the hotel were wonderful. Having the heated pool was perfect for the time of the year. The spa was very relaxing and luxurious. We only ate at the buffet restaurant and the choice was plentiful. My children loved the desserts!    It was one of family members' birthday during our stay and we were able to arrange a lovely surprise for him. The staff came in with the cake and sang (in three languages!) which was a nice touch. Thank you to the restaurant staff and Aziz in particular for organising it.    Unfortunately we found out that our flight was cancelled when we arrived at the airport. The hotel was accommodating and gave us two suites for the night at the same price.

Kenzi Menara Palace,annaatebh wrote a review Dec 2018,40,Very good hotel,Very large five star hotel which we would give four stars too following our visit  The room though large and with a good balcony was a little tired and especially the bathroom where the grouting was poor    Buffet and restaurant was very good with enough selections to suit everyone    Pool are and pool bar were excellent    Beware the concierge though who over charged us for a day out with a guid and driver (£90!) and we still had to pay entrance fees to each site we visited. When discussed with the hotel customer relations they were very apologetic. When we challenged the concierge however he was defensive and a little difficult. A few hours later clearly having been spoken to by senior hotel staff presented us with a typical silver coloured teapot as an apology    Beware and haggle everywhere!,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Matlock, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annaatebh

Kenzi Menara Palace,joffre t wrote a review Dec 2018,50,very good stay,Kenzi Menara Palace Hotel. Marrakesh.  On the transfer from the airport the rep informed me the booking in at my hotel was from 14.30hrs. We arrived at the Menara Palace just after 10.30 fully expecting to be told to wait for a few hours  I presented myself to the reception and before I could speak I was greeted by my name ( this is the first time I have found a receptionist that bothered to research her guest list). She then said that my room was ready and would I like a ground floor or a first floor. ( This really took the wind out of my sails). I requested a first floor room and while she was programming my room key this big man in a concierge uniform started to pick up my cases. I explained to him that I did not have any local money not being able to change any English money at the airport. He replied I was not to worry as he was doing his job.  The Minara Palace is a very big hotel and with out the help of the concierge I would not have found my room easily. At the door he made sure that the key worked and wished me a pleasant stay I again apologised for not being able to tip him. He replied that it was is job and he enjoyed helping people no swearing in Berber or Arabic.  My room was three rooms lounge bedroom and shower bathroom  All of the rooms were clean tidy and enough bottled water to satisfy the thirstiest person.  After travelling all day I needed a shower. The water was hot and plentiful. I did find that my feet slipped on the tiled floor as I was showering. By placing a shower mat by the shower door and walking like a penguin I was able to stay up right.  The food in the main restaurant was plentiful and well presented. The hotel caters for people from a wide number of counties so some of the food was strange to me. By looking at what was on offer and trying various selections I was able to select food which suited me. The beef was well cooked and the lamb baked with pineapple was excellent. The only thing wrong was that the plates were cold this took any heat out of the food before I could get to the table. How ever there was a microwave were you could heat your meal in two minutes. His was really useful at breakfast for turning runny scrambled egg into well cooked scrambled egg. Whilst the restaurant is self service there was plenty of staff to help you with drinks and any other thing you may need.  The grounds are well maintained and there are two pools plenty of loungers and pool towels are provided. Near the pools is the snack bar which provides light meals and drinks. The largest of the pools is cold (very cold) and the smallest is heated.  The hotel provides a shuttle bus to take you to Marrakesh and return you to the hotel. It is best to get to the pick up point about ten minutes before the collection time.  Nit picking time:- the showers could do with shower mats to prevent slipping in the shower. The dinning room could do with warm plates and the salt pots on the dinning tables could do with a few raw rice seeds in them to stop the salt becoming damp and could you stop switching the corridor lights off just after 07.00hrs in the morning as it can be quite dark if you are going for an early breakfast.  To sum up the Manara Palace is a large well kept hotel with nice staff. Would I go back to this hotel yes I would if they can maintain this level of service then it will be the best hotel in north Africa.  Thank you all for make my stay so enjoyable.,Date of stay: December 2018,,"Winsford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joffret
Kenzi Menara Palace,Chorizogolf wrote a review Dec 2018,50,Perfect for a lazy break,If all you are looking for is a lazy break in a very attractive hotel with good service and long-range views of the Atlas Mountains this place is hard to beat.    Maybe it was because the place was far from full but service from the many staff was excellent: even down to the sous-chef who wrote out a local recipe for me.    Our room was on a 'promo' discount so was probably one of the worst in the hotel - overlooking the main entrance with views to the city beyond - but it was huge and well-equipped. We were on an all-inclusive basis. The restaurant offered some food cooked to order but most was preprepared on a buffet basis. The starters and pastries were outstanding in terms of quality and choice. The mains were a little variable and often only lukewarm but if you didn't like something you went and got something else.    Basic cocktails beer and quite drinkable wine was available and there was free water wherever you want. The lunch-time snacks in the pool par were prepared to order and a good alternative to the main restaurant. At both the pool bar and the main restaurant there were resident sparrows picking up crumbs from tables: health and safety are not on an EU standard but this is Africa!    Externally the hotel was centred in the middle of a large garden with a massive and cold pool and smaller heated pool with an adjacent bar. Excursions were available from the Thomas Cook rep via the hotel or agencies in town. The only small minus was that there was nowhere local to go after dinner unless you took a taxi to the centre of Marrakesh: a walk to the local Carrefour was the most exciting option.    If like us you are after 7 days lazing in the sun with a few half-day excursions we would recommend this place unreservedly. If you are looking for a bit of action and some nightlife go elsewhere.,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Newark-on-Trent, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chorizogolf

Kenzi Menara Palace,troberts52 wrote a review Nov 2018,20,Poor quality food,We stayed at the Kenzi Menara Palace on an all inclusive basis. As mentioned in a number of previous reviews the Hotel is in a good location with decent facilities including a spa and a great pool. An initial complaint about the bath was eventually dealt with by an upgrade which was nice. However the quality of the food throughout our stay was poor. The advertised Italian restaurant was closed despite reception still taking bookings for it! We did try the Moroccan restaurant but had to wait over an hour for the main course which was inedible went it turned up. The hot food in the main buffet restaurant was lukewarm at best and it was often a struggle to find something decent to eat. This restaurant was routinely packed with few spare tables and cutlery at a premium (you usually had to ask several times to get a full set). The main bar ran out of gin for 3 days and beer for one night. Complaints were often met by indifference particularly by the managers. The problem seemed to be that the Hotel had been taken over by a number of large parties of golfers and the staff simply could not cope with the numbers. Nevertheless the problems we experienced could easily have been addressed with a little bit of forward planning and it is a shame that a nice hotel is being let down by poor management.,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Olney, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/troberts52

Kenzi Menara Palace,408Sue wrote a review Nov 2018,30,Management need to lead from the front,Check out experience summarised the overall experience. I was asked how our holiday had been and I explained that we had been disappointed with the food especially the Moroccan restaurant where we had to wait over an hour for our meal. The team member I was speaking to showed concern and called his manager over. He explained our conversation the manager shrugged and walked off.This echoed what we had seen all week. Lots of management wandering around and chatting to each other very little action. Some staff in the restaurants were working very hard to deal with a large number of guests with no support or leadership.This management attitude flowed through to how staff responded to enquires (eg room maintenance restaurant booking).I would echo many other tripadvisor comments - food lukewarm and disappointing bar service (they ran out of beer and gin during the week we were there) no spoons available at meals etc. Overall the grounds and pool are lovely and rooms spacious. Hotel let down by quality of food and inconsistent service (clearly linked to poor tone set by management).,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/408Sue

I would also like to mention two Mohameds one tall lanky one serving breakfast with a smiling face very humble and another who ran the sports and entertainment at the hotel. Both are fantastic blokes.However there is one thing to note that the hotel does not offer non-smoking policy in communal areas which I found unusual in 21st Century.Overall it is an excellent place to stay beautiful gardens and magnificent views of Atlas mountains.

Upon arrival we were greeted with very friendly reception staff of whom checked us in very promptly and we were then taken to our suite.  We had a deluxe garden suite and couldn’t fault it it was very cleanvery spacious and exceeded our expectations.  The food is as you always get at an all inclusivethere was plenty of choice pancakes and eggs cooked freshly at breakfast wine served with your own bottleopened and you could taste it before you were satisfied with itthe desserts were scrummy and they went down a treat even though we are not dessert people.  It was my partners birthday whilst we were there and they very kindly organised a birthday cake for him and sang happy birthday to him they made sure we had a marvellous time whilst we were there.

Kenzi Menara Palace,11Jilly wrote a review Oct 2018,30,Didn’t feel like five star service,We’ve just come back from Marrakech and had a lovely holiday. I am going to try to give a balanced review that reflects why I believe this hotel is resting on its five star laurels.    The abridged version - beautiful hotel that needs some smartening up service sometimes great but I got the feeling that we should be grateful to be there and if things weren’t right tough!    In terms of facilities you can’t deny that the hotel has everything going for it: beautiful reception and public areas which look and smell divine plenty of comfy sofas and places to sit with a drink spa lovely gardens best pool I’ve ever seen (just under Olympic size) one of the best hotel gyms I’ve seen hard working animation team arranging activities around the pool poolside drinks/snack bar huge suites comfy beds plenty of sun beds and towels really good concierge good buffet restaurant with two additional restaurants available at extra charge evening singer in the bar two or three nice souvenir shops in the hotel. Food was delicious and the pastry chef superb my only gripe was that quite often food meant to be hot was lukewarm. Most of the staff are very friendly most of the time and there are cleaning staff present in public areas throughout the day keeping it clean. They also have a currency exchange service and an ATM (more on that later).    The negatives:  On arrival at around 12.15 our room wasn’t ready. We eventually got into our room at 4pm after a lot of “come back after lunch” “come back in half an hour” “come back in 15 minutes”. So we wasted our first day. If we’d been told it would take that long we could have changed out of our thick clothing and sat by the pool.  I had emailed the hotel twice in advance of our stay to make a request for a particular room. Each time I received an automated response but no actual reply. On check in when I said I was surprised I hadn’t had a response the receptionist said “we never got your emails”. They were acknowledged so that wasn’t true. In passing I had mentioned that it was my birthday while we were there and this is the only five star hotel (in fact the only hotel) I’ve ever stayed in that doesn’t acknowledge a Birthday in some way on the day.  I was also surprised that we were given no information about the hotel facilities meal times etc on check in. When we asked the following day a lovely young lady gave us a printed sheet of info and sat down with us to go through it. So why not give that out on check in?    I pointed out to reception one day that the lights in our block weren’t working and straight away got a fob off along the lines of “in Morocco we’re still in summertime and the lights don’t come on for another couple of weeks”. I made a comment to the effect that he could come and pick me up if I fell over on the stairs in the dark. The next day the lights were on. Instead of fobbing me off why not just say “we’ll look into it”. The assumption was that I would be wrong not five star service.    The ATM was never working in the ten days we were at the hotel and the cashier never had any dirham despite the rates bring displayed every day. Bearing in mind Morocco has a closed currency so you can’t buy in the UK and all tours have to be paid for in local currency this is quite an inconvenience. When I complained about this it was met with a shrug and a smile.    Service at the main bar was very inefficient at times with some staff acting like it was a bit of a nuisance to go to the effort of serving you. Not all of the time but service should be consistent. Quite often drinks would run out - white wine one evening beer another. Similarly in the main restaurant inconsistency. Sometimes a warm welcome sometimes sitting waiting for ages for cutlery and napkins. Only the female waitress in the evenings and one of the young men were super efficient all the time. And without wanting to sound paranoid I agree with another reviewer that the French definitely received a warmer welcome. Maybe a language thing.    As mentioned there are plenty of sun beds and clean towels around the pool. However I saw no evidence in the time we were there that the sunbeds were ever cleaned in fact quite the reverse with sun cream dust and footprints on the cushions. Cleanliness in our room was OK but not brilliant. Not enough to complain about but just a bit dusty and below standard.    In summary I may well come back here but the pool is the main attraction for me as I could get a proper swim each day and I’d shop around. My comments on the negatives were mostly relatively small issues but when added together don’t add up to a five star experience. With some attention to detail this could be a fabulous place.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Wakefield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/11Jilly
Kenzi Menara Palace,Yousaf S wrote a review Oct 2018,40,3.5 rounded up to a 4,My review tends to follow the same as recent reviews of the hotel.  Reception and bar areas are beautiful the rooms are big however tired looking. The towel rack in the bathroom fell off the wall the shower head leaked and sprayed in several different directions the bathroom door wouldn't close (it would hit the frame) and the general tidiness of the room was not up to scratch. When new the rooms would've been great however they are in need of maintenance as it appears it's not just myself noticing the below par state of the rooms.  My family and I went all inclusive which overall was good apart from one night for dinner where everything that could've went wrong went wrong which resulted in a complaint being made to the restaurant manager. I won't go into detail as apart from that one meal the restaurant staff were attentive and polite. The breakfast staff more so especially Yassin who was a credit to the hotel with his service and attitude.  The food does get a bit samey but I imagine this happens at most all inclusive holidays wherever you go but the pool bar was a welcome change up offering burgers sandwiches salads or pastas.  The only issue I'd like to bring up is maybe a little bit of English training for some of the staff. When I asked the breakfast chef if he could make poached eggs he didn't seem to understand even when I used Google translate and pictures. Sadly my GCSE C in French failed me in trying to translate also.  Overall it was still a good stay but I believe they need to just tighten their belts to truly justify calling themselves as a five star hotel.  Would I recommend the hotel to others? I would if maintenance went round to all the rooms to fix the issues which seems apparent in a lot of rooms.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Nottingham, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y0usafS

Kenzi Menara Palace,takeitallin14 wrote a review Oct 2018,30,Just meh,So it’s a HUGE place which was a little frustrating as one is walking to ones room possibly for a bit. The room is well appointed but has two slightly larger than twin beds—strange. What was also strange is that the pillows were enormously thick oddest thing I’ve seen at a hotel in awhile. I had to ask for a less thick pillow! I kinda got one.    The room on the second floor is a sauna! I am still here and being told that all the rooms are like this because they’ve switched to heat. For reference it was 80 F (roughly 27 C) today and the room is stifling. I have the main door and the patio door open. I asked for a fan and still haven’t seen one get delivered.    I am apparently near the access point for WiFi and still can’t use a VPN and without that still am only getting 1 or two bars. The pools are really pretty and the safe are nice. The breakfast is not the American breakfast so don’t be surprised by no pancakes and such but it is pretty robust honestly. It’s quiet enough and the towels are pretty soft no real complaints there. There’s a little dessert tray and fruit basket waiting for you with plenty of bottled water as well. It is a pretty hotel. I might stay again but I’d make sure it was either dead of “winter” or height of summer to make sure the temp in the room is right. It is just very hard to sleep when it is this hot and uncomfortable.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled on business,takeitallin14,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/takeitallin14
Kenzi Menara Palace,Gordon D wrote a review Oct 2018,20,Very disappointing from arrival to departure,We had booked 4 nights all inclusive at the Kenzi Menara Palace at the end of our Morocco trip to relax and soak up the sun after 3 days in the Medina at the amazing Les Jardins du Koutoubia hotel and 2 days in the Atlas mountains. We had read the reviews beforehand on trip advisor and whilst slightly concerned with some most seemed to speak very positively so we were looking forward to our last few days in Morocco. On arrival you enter a very impressive reception and we were greeted with friendly if somewhat young and inexperienced reception staff and offered a drink whilst we completed the necessary govt forms. Then we were taken to our room a junior suite on the 1st floor. Initial impressions were very good. A large well appointed room with balcony overlooking the pool. Very quickly however we noticed that the large sliding doors did not close due to the frame being severely bent. Closer inspection of the room discovered a damaged tv unit the doors were at a jaunty angle and the base completely broken multiple marks and damage to walls and edges of units legs of glass topped coffee table so loose it was on the brink of collapse and a general sense of tiredness of all the decor and fixtures/fittings. However the most worrying concern was the state of cleanliness. There were cup ring marks on surfaces which had not been wiped crumbs on seating staining (too disgusting to describe) on the sofa areas around the corners under the bedside unit which had what must be months worth of dirt build up en suite shower mould on corners and sealant around bath requiring replacing. All in all pretty grim for a £250/night 5 star hotel. Needless to say we left our bags unpacked and demanded to speak with the manager. Staff were very apologetic and we were initially taken to see another room which on entering with the concierge we discovered a most surprised partially dressed couple. After copious apologies from the concierge we were marched back to reception where he threw the room card at the young receptionist shouted at her in moroccan and stormed off. Again staff very apologetic. Round 3! Another room with sadly similar wear and tear and cleanliness issues which we eventually agreed to take after an assurance to re clean and a realisation that this was the general condition of all the rooms. After the additional cleaning which was a vast improvement we moved in. Over the next couple of days we sampled the food at one of the 3 restaurants and the buffet and the standard was good. As all inclusive we enjoyed local wine with our meals and whilst spirits and beer were fairly generic local fare they were quite acceptable. The hotel is quite large but was certainly not full during our stay abd popular with french and brits. We did get a strong sense that the french speakers were prioritised by staff not only in terms of table and bar service but also in attitude. This was despite my best efforts to speak french. In general though staff were friendly but there was not the attentiveness we would normally expect at 5 star level. As we write this review we are still at the hotel due to leave tomorrow. My lunchtime experience today has prompted me to write this review early primarily as a form of therapy! A simple order at the poolside bar not busy for a cheeseburger has developed into quite a saga. The initial delivery was minus cheese and salad. On querying staff apologised adding that it was for another customer. Cue round 2. Cheeseburger arrives this time with salad but still no cheese. Again queried on this occasion I was advised that I had requested no cheese. Not the case. The menu said cheeseburger. I asked fir cheeseburger. Then finally after a further wait cheeseburger number 3 arrived fully loaded but sadly with an extremely burnt bun in effect charcoal. I cannot believe that having twice got such a simple task wrong any catering manager or staff would allow this to happen. I got the impression that it was two fingers up to me for having had the audacity to complain. To summarise please think very carefully before booking this hotel. My wife and I are in our early 50 ‘s educated and well travelled. Sure we have had some excellent experiences and some grim. This place is not the worst but it is by some margin the worst value for money. More worryingly the hotel management dont seem to grasp this. This will have been an exceptional standard of hotel when new but the rooms are desperately in need of an overhaul Management are not visible and staff left to deal with issues are inexperienced. I will be seeking a partial refund from my credit card provider on my return to the uk as the service was not as described.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NorthStar822677
Kenzi Menara Palace,C B wrote a review Oct 2018,30,Hotel of two halves,In most respects it is excellent however there are some serious deficiencies which let it down. Reading other reviews this may account for the vast difference. The main reception foyer and bar area are lovely very relaxing decor in the moorish style with lots of comfortable seating areas. The evening entertainment is in this area and is generally a guitarist piano player and singer. This makes for a relaxing atmosphere after dinner.The bar is never crowded and the service is generally good.The gardens are very attractive and well kept with various areas to sit and relax either in the shade or the sun. The pool is huge cold water and there are ample sun beds arranged around the pool area with plenty of space between so you do not feel overcrowded.There is no issue of claiming sunbeds at the crack of dawn as there are plenty. Towels are provided and there is subtle music played during the day. The area is kept clean and tidy by staff I. Motorised boards. The pool bar is pretty a large area also in a moorish style and you rarely have to queue. The food service is waiter too. There are numerous Bali beds either side of the pool. The bedrooms are huge with a large comfortable bed and the concierge is helpful arranging guides and taxis which I would recommend. We stayed all inclusive. At dinner wine was served by a waiter at your table with a new bottle opened for you and white being served in an ice bucket. Both the red and the white are fine local and I have tasted worse. Water and soft drinks are also served but if you want a beer or cocktail then you must go to the bar yourself. All this makes for a very relaxing stay however there are serious issues at this hotelwhich really lets it down.  There seems to be a problem with overbooking.We arrived with Thomas Cook at 11.30 am. We were welcomed at reception with a blue wrist band and told to come back at 2pm to be allocated a room. We had been travelling since 1am and were dressed for an English autumn so we had an uncomfortable wait only to be told at 2pm that they were overbooked and to come back at 3pm. This happened to two other couples on our tour. I returned at 2.45pm for an update and was told they were still looking for a room. I asserted myself and was tod they would find us a better room. We were given a suite which was massive and much more than we needed but we lost the first day of our holiday sat around waiting. A threesome of girls were moved to another hotel if a lower class for two nights until a room came free.  The next issue is the cleanliness and hygiene in regard to food service. Our room was dated and a bit grubby.thenshiwer was poor and was not clean. The food hygiene is even worse. We ate in the Moroccan restaurant the second night paying extra for this. We were offered crime brûlée as dessert. When I put my spoon in mine it was like scrambled egg and curdled. I refused to eat mine but my husband ate his to his regret. He bacame very ill during the night and had diarrhoea. We had booked a tour of the city with a guide and driver and he felt OK however he became vioetly sick in the taxi in the middle of the main square.Very humiliating for him ( we are retired professionals not binge drinkers).The tour had to be cut short. I constantly found packets of butter off and milk curdled. I drank black tea to be safe. I also became ill later in the week after eating one bite of a burger at the pool which I realised was off on tasting.  The last issue is not as serious but still very irritating. They run out of supplies. We asked for butter and were told there was none left there was a very nice leg of lamb one night but when we went for our main course it had run out and there was still an hour left of service. The pool bar could not provide a mojito as it had run out of one of the ingredients and on another occasion my husband asked for a white rum and come and was told there was no white rum left! This is unsatisfactory in what is supposed to be a five star hotel.    I would love to return for the relaxation but would be very wary.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E2531IDcb
Kenzi Menara Palace,natjohn2018 wrote a review Oct 2018,20,Kitchen problems?,Definitely NOT a 5 star hotel. Grounds and rooms are fine but the food is poor in term of quality presentation choice and taste. As a family of three all of us went sick. Scrambled eggs were cold the butter has split some food smelt off. Flocks of birds came into the dining room to eat on the tables. The staff was friendly but not trained as 5 star staff should be attentive to the customer. Getting a coffee at breakfast was a struggle. Only one waitress in the evening was very efficient. We have been to Marrocco many times and always enjoyed the food but not this time.

Kenzi Menara Palace,30minute wrote a review Oct 2018,50,"Just fantastic, fabulous hotel and great friendly service",We are staying at the hotel at the moment and it is fantastic. Stunning hotel beautiful grounds and lovely staff offering great service. I honestly don't understand how some people have given the hotel a poor review.    The main foyer reception and bar area is stunning. Large and Arabic design with the smell of incense. Lovely bar and big comfy seats everywhere. It's pretty impressive when you walk in.    Reception staff are fantastic. Our room faced a busy road and we asked to be moved to a quiter room if possible. The young lady on reception couldn't have been more helpful and the same for our porter who moved our cases.    The rooms are fabulous. In fact it's a suite not a room. Absolutely huge bed and very spacious. Big bathroom with twin sinks. A foyer area in your room and two big balconies. The largest room we've ever had on a family holiday. We've got 2 single beds for the kids in the lounge and still spacious.    The food and service in the restaurant is superb. No long queues for a drink. Waiter service serving at the tables white wine served in ice bucket and waiter offered me the wine to taste. Best all inclusive service we've ever had. And the food is fabulous. Gorgeous salads and so much variety. Couldnt fault it.    Pool areas are great. Masses of comfy sunbed everywhere as well as many private veiled cubicles with a huge bedding are although cubicle is a very clinical description almost private tent areas. Great service at the bar and good selection of drinks.    A general point on the service. It is excellent. Everyone has been friendly and so helpful.    This is so different from your average all inclusive in Spain. It's huge and spacious and very welcoming. Grounds are lovely and the service food and accommodation are excellent!

We went to the concierge for a tour we paid £70 to see the Atlas Mountains and waterfall but he filed to tell us once there we had to pay another 20 Euro each to see the waterfall so our trip ended after lunch and we came back as we hadn’t bought enough money with us we were made to feel very uncomfortable that we declined the waterfall guide...when we arrived back the concierge wasn’t even apologetic just said you could have paid when you got back here that wasn’t the point we were told a price and then were expected to pay extra......so this ruined our trip and was a waste of £70.  Changing money up is very difficult as they almost never have enough.  One guy I can’t remember his name was very helpful and did change it as he said they have money upstairs but it takes time so my guess is some of them can’t be bothered.  Overall a good stay but as I say just a few things that do not warrant this being a five star I would say a 4 star in my opinion.  But it is beautiful and the staff are nice they work very hard.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Graham P wrote a review Oct 2018,40,Good value 4star experience,We were worried about a week's stay here (having seen mixed reviews) but did not need to be. 7 friends in all and impressed with the willingness of the staff to help with queries and problems. The rooms were large and beds very comfortable; ours overlooking the gardens and these rooms are quieter than the poolside with its fun music etc during the day. Pools were large but not heated so hot weather is a must to enjoy these fully. Heated pool is in the spa but you pay to use it.  We went all inclusive and recommend this as drinks and snacks can mount up; beer was ok red wine was quaffable and better than we expected (we know our wines to). Buffet foods were diverse multiple choices and healthy. we had no complaints albeit the Moroccan restaurant was disappointing as the food there was served in the buffet anyway!  We had problems with one room and requested a change; this was accommodated a day later without too much fuss we had toilet flushing problems eventually fixed but they excelled when requested to make a birthday cake for one evening. Our waitress arranged it all and the cake was brilliant. Sponge jam ice cream and a raspberry gel topping......and all the restaurant joined in........a Moroccan band joined us aswell!    I have seen complaints about bar staff but we were served well even though a conference with 300 guests were resident in the week. All-in-all a friendly helpful staff made up for some deficiences in the building.    Just one recommendation would be not to overbook the rooms; the hotel should rely upon its great culture and staff to fill their beds.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Melton Mowbray, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/967grahamp

Kenzi Menara Palace,Karla O wrote a review Oct 2018,40,Not a 5 star hotel but really good!,We had two sets of reservations for this hotel and after receiving an email from them expecting us  we were told upon arrival that they were overbooked so we were sent to Kenzi Club Agdal for the first two nights. I wasn’t sure if it would be better or not but I tired to make the best of it. Well Kenzi Club Agdal was pretty mediocre to say the least. I have to say I’m not an “All Inclusive” kind of gal as sometimes those places tend to have terrible drinks and bland food and that’s exactly what you get there. When we came back from our desert trip we stayed at Kenzi Menara and that was a major step up. The hotel is just so much prettier the rooms need some TLC but they are better and so is the food. We had a much better time here than at the Club.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Los Angeles, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karlao500
Kenzi Menara Palace,Roshni K wrote a review Oct 2018,30,Positive & negative,This is a really hard review as the hotel itself is beautiful it’s a shame we didn’t get to spend the whole holiday there as we’d booked! We had booked to stay 4 nights at this hotel but only got 2 nights.    When we arrived on the Thursday we were told that the hotel was overbooked and we would be sent to spend 2 out of 4 nights at Kenzi Medina Agadar which we were told was the same standard hotel as Kenzi Palace. We knew for a fact this is not the case as we had that hotel on our shortlist when we were researching where to stay and it was cheaper than Kenzi Palace and generally the reviews weren’t as good which is why we paid more to stay at Kenzi Palace.    We didn’t have a choice but to go to the other hotel due to the overbooking but the room we were given was too small for 3 ladies & it wasn’t made up. We asked to be moved and again we were moved to a room that wasn’t made up and was the same size; the only difference was that we had access to a quieter private pool so we took it as there were no other larger rooms available.    Kenzi Palace offered us a suite on our last 2 nights a free 30min massage & 20min hammam scrub experience each and we also negotiated a bottle of wine too. We stayed on an all-inclusive basis so the wine was one from the premium list and we were told we could pick anything from the list. We were also told that we would have access to a 24hr shuttle between the 2 hotels so we could use the facilities and restaurants at Kenzi Palace if we wanted to.    However every time we asked reception at Kenzi Medina to call us a shuttle we had to explain the reason why every time. We also had to wait on average 30min each time. I’ve never spent so much time in hotel lobbies as I have on this trip!    On the Saturday we checked out of Kenzi Medina to go to Kenzi Palace for our final 2 nights. We asked for the shuttle and waited 45min for it waiting in the hotel lobby! Even though we were told our room would be ready at 12pm surprise surprise it wasn’t so again more time wasted. We basically spent all of Saturday packing waiting in 2 hotel lobbies & then unpacking what we could for our final 2 nights. What a waste of a day for us especially as we were only on a 4-day holiday.    The suite we were given was nice but the toilet in the main bathroom wasn’t flushing properly and the shower was leaking.    We were living out of a suitcase for the whole trip as for 2 days in 1 hotel and 2 days in another you can’t really unpack properly which was a real inconvenience.    We asked the receptionist at Kenzi Palace to put all the compensation elements in writing (the suite massage hammam experience wine & 24hr shuttle between the 2 hotels) but were told they don’t do that. By chance we spoke to a couple who were also sent to Kenzi Medina due to the overbooking and they told us that they got it all in writing. So why was it 1 answer for 1 guest and another answer for another guest?    Food is disappointingly bland at both hotels especially for a country with such rich flavours. I can appreciate that they are catering for the masses and also making large quantities of food but even the Moroccan themed menu on the Friday evening was a disappointment in flavours.    The restaurant staff were the most pleasant. The reception staff started off friendly with us when we first arrived but this changed each day and we could tell that they didn’t want to talk to us when we went to the reception desk. They were quite rude at times and not as friendly towards us as what we saw with other guests.    So as beautiful as the actual hotel is the experience above means I can’t whole heartedly recommend it which is a real shame.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Bournemouth,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roshni0509

As with many large resorts of this class it had a large lobby inside and pool side bars a large and a smaller adult only pool and ample lounge chairs. The rooms were generous and beds comfortable. The reason for the 3 stars was the food.    Overall the food was disappointing. The buffet was limited and repetitive daily. The coffee was self serve from a machine - many other Moroccan resorts have baristas and delicious cafe crème. The afternoon pool resto does not open its food service to all inclusive guests until 3 pm while paying clients can order any time. And the à la carte Moroccan evenings restaurant charged extra for our meal.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Nagor7 wrote a review Oct 2018,10,Very Very Poor Customer Service,We booked here for an eleven night family holiday during August. From the start we found the whole holiday to be one of the worst customer service experiences of our lives. Never have we been treated so poorly and inefficiently by staff. From check in to check out it was just one blunder after another. So many things went wrong and I will list a few but genuinely the list is endless. It is NOT a five star hotel and whilst the facilities are good the hotel is seriously let down by its inefficient staff.  To list but a few points...  When arriving in Menara Airport we had pre-booked a private transfer with the hotel. All confirmed by email from KMP. No transfer showed up to collect us. After an hour waiting around at the airport we made our own way to the hotel. No apology was given! Not wanting to dwell on the missing transfer we proceeded to check in to our rooms.  Before we had booked the hotel we emailed asking could we have interconnecting rooms. As this was a family holiday it was essential for us to have interconnecting rooms. KMP confirmed by email that they did. You can imagine the upset caused at check in after traveling for ten hours when they told us they had NO interconnecting rooms available for us in fact they had no rooms beside each other. What??? We had booked the hotel months in advance specifically for this reason and I had the emails to prove it. The girl at check in could not have been more indifferent or unhelpful. I asked to speak to the manager. She said their was none available to speak to me. She told us there was absolutely nothing that could be done for us no apology nothing just a shrug. What a TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE start to a family holiday to have our family split up in different rooms. Exhausted from travel we reluctantly accepted the only two rooms they had left. I slept in one room with my son and my husband slept in another room on a different floor. Not once during our stay did we receive an apology really dreadful customer service.  Poolside on our first day there we asked could drinks be brought to our loungers we were told by the poolside staff that NO the hotel does not do poolside service to the loungers. Strange we thought for a five star but we respected this as hotel policy. However throughout our stay there daily the staff did in fact bring drinks to certain guests poolside. It made no sense at all and nobody could explain to us why?    Avoid booking trips at Guest Relations. We booked four excursions all had to be paid in full in cash. No receipts?? Strange? They don’t accept cards at Guest Relations (throughout our stay there the ATM never worked)  First trip was quad biking they had no space for my husband in the car that came to collect us and wanted me to sit on his lap... em NO!! Eventually a second car came and when we got to the desert I was told that we hadn’t paid??? Thankfully I had taken a photo of the itinerary. Second trip we waited to be collected at reception but nobody knew anything about the booking. Farcical!! We canceled the other trips and got our money back.  Honestly I could write a book about all the mishaps that occurred whilst we were there but suffice to stay we won’t be returning as we felt undervalued as guests throughout our stay there.  However I would like to finish on a positive note and complement the two hardest working members of staff the poolside entertainment team of Amine and Hassan who are the true (and only) stars of the team! If only the rest of the staff could work as tirelessly at representing your hotel in the positive manner that they do the hotel would be a far better place!!

Kenzi Menara Palace,Adam A wrote a review Sep 2018,10,Terrible Service and Overbooked Rooms,"It's hard to start on recalling such a horrible experience with this hotel.    First we booked the hotel in February for a September trip. We were attending a music festival in Marrakech and it was one of four hotels on the shuttle service. So we booked in February for 4 nights.    Chase which we booked the trip through confirmed our room the week before.    When we arrived everything seemed fine. We sat down and they offered us a welcome cocktail. As we were filling out the paperwork they came over and said they were overbooked. However they could get us a room at their sister property which was ""exactly the same"" and they'd give us all-inclusive. We were going to be gone most of the days and nights and not eating there and said we'd rather stay. We said we wanted the shuttle service and they stated that they had arranged a special shuttle for that hotel since there were a few other people in a similar situation. We finally agreed and got moved to the other hotel.    We arrived at the Kenzi Manara Agdal which was NOT ""exactly the same"". It was a much lower quality hotel down to what the staff was wearing (suits at Palace/polos at Agdal). First instead of giving us the 1100 sq. foot room we paid for they wanted to put us in a 300 sq. foot room. After 45 minutes they finally agreed to put us in a suite which was only 500 sq. feet less than half of what we had already paid for. Also instead of the view room that we paid for we were in a dark bottom floor that was directly off the main path. In addition we talked to friends working at the festival who told us that the hotel lied to us and that there was not shuttle from the Agdal. They offered instead to have us take one shuttle from the Agdal to the Palace and then we could wait for the shuttle to the festival. And then on our own at 4:00 or 5:00 a.m. in the morning we'd have to find a way back to this hotel.    Oh and they also lost my backpack which contained my laptop toiletries and other personal items. They forgot to take it out of the van moving us between hotels and caused undo stress until they found it an hour later.    This was not acceptable to us so we called our credit card that booked it Chase. They spoke with the hotel and were able to secure us our room so they said. So we packed up again into their van and went back to the Kenzi Manara Palace. However when we got there we were told the NEW confirmation didn't matter and they still didn't have a hotel room for us. They told us there was nothing they could do and had no idea why someone would give us a new confirmation number. We found out that they booked a large conference for NL a French multi-level marketing company and just decided to bump us and a lot of others that had booked a long time ago. There were a number of people yelling in the lobby at the staff for this very issue. They admitted they booked 16 reservations for the 14 rooms of our size and overbooked a lot of their other rooms    After a few hours of waiting for a solution they tried to book us into another hotel which was close-ish but also didn't have a shuttle. However those rooms were also very small. Instead they offered to get us a room when we got back from the festival when someone checked out and then we'd get the room we paid for in February sometime around 2:00 p.m. People we spoke with who went to the Agdal had to pay an average of $60 a day for taxis to and from the festival since there was no festival shuttle there.    Instead of settling in our room after two weeks of living out of a suitcase we had to take all of our luggage to go shower and change in their spa. They held our luggage and we went to the festival. Thankfully we met other people who got their hotel room in the Palace who let us sleep on their couches when we got back at 4:00 a.m. since there was no room for us. We got a temporary room with two twin beds at around 9:30 a.m. and finally got our room at around 1:00 p.m.    Here is what the hotel offered us for our troubles and overbooking our room that we booked in February:    1) Their all-inclusive dining which (a) we barely used since we were gone most of the days and (b) was not good at all. Everything was over-salted. I felt like I had to leave half of every meal on my plate since it was close to inedible.    2) They were not going to charge us for the night they didn't give us a room. Yes that's right - that was something they were ""giving"" us - not charging us for a room we didn't sleep in. They stated since they offered another room in another hotel even though it was 1/3 the size in a lesser hotel and worth significantly less than what we had already paid they didn't have to give us a refund but they did so out of the kindness of their heart.    Overall I would recommend NEVER staying here. Just terrible service terrible food and they would rather kick out people that paid 7 months ago instead of a ponzi scheme that books a large chunk of rooms later.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Joanne r wrote a review Sep 2018,40,A very relaxing week.,Overall this was a lovely hotel.Our room was nice and was cleaned to a high standard on a daily basis by the maids who were all friendly and polite.  The pool was beautiful . Service at the pool bar was good however there were issues over being able to get decent sunloungers in a good position. I noticed sunloungers and particularly the big beds were often reserved by people who had put towels etc. on them then nobody would come near them all day!  The Hotel bar was good and contrary to other reviews I did not have any problem getting served. In fact by the middle of our week long stay I found that my drink was in front of me before I had chance to ask for it! The nightly entertainment was of a high standard and very enjoyable.  The food was excellent. There was alot of choice and it was all well presented. We did have a rather unpleasant experience one lunch time though. We had sat down at a table which apparently was reserved for somebody. When we sat down the dining room was empty and there was no reserved card on the table.A man then came over and said that table was reserved. I apologised and told him I had not realised. He made rather a fuss about it to the point that other guests who were now sitting nearby became aware of the situation and it was all a bit embarassing. I assume the man was a member of staff as he then went and had a heated conversation with other members of staff resulting in us being asked to move our table while in the middle of trying to eat our food. As a paying guest I did not feel that kind of treatment was justified.  Apart from the aforementioned incident I would definately recommend this hotel and would definately stay here again.,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J3864GWjoanner
Kenzi Menara Palace,aenert wrote a review Aug 2018,40,A week at SENTIDO,We spent eight days here at the begining of August as a celebration for my daughter. We chose this hotel as I had stayed at a SENTIDO in Spain before at a adults only and it was nice then.    This hotel was nice as you drive up to it - it had security at the bottom of the drive and a metal detector as you walk through the main door of the hotel - very welcoming beautiful decor lovely “huge” pool. Room was big a bit tired looking in parts i.e. shabby outdoor garden furniture - seats without padded seats and a bit broken.    We had a pool view but I wouldn’t bother again as you are hardly in it. A bit noisy at night as the music plays loud and if I was to choose again I would choose a room at the back furthest away from the restaurant.    Good food we were all inclusive and at times they asked us for our room number which iI thought was odd as we had one of those awful wrist bands on and sure enough they tried to charge us room service as we checked out even though we didn’t have any - so be aware!    The bus runs to the center at two hourly intervals but the last bus back is 19.15 which seems a bit early to me - not sure why they don’t run it later.    Overall nice place to stay but for me I would stay in a Riad in the center next time but perfect for families - especially younger children.    We didn’t bother with all the entertainment at night but it looked great for the small children.    Just one thing try not to get scammed in the center as they will pretend to bump into you and start talking to you and leading you down the small lanes to the tannery to buy carpets and other stuff and will want payment for showing you. Have you wits about you and be assertive as they appear to have absolutely no scruples about making money out of tourists.    I would go back to Marrakesh as I really enjoyed the hustle and bustle and all the colours but would do a few trips next time.    If you want tradition then choose a Riad and not the SENTIDO as you could be in the south of France as it is mostly french speaking.,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aenert
Kenzi Menara Palace,Edvard B wrote a review Aug 2018,40,A few lovely days!,We stayed here for four nights late July 2018. Upon arriving the service at the reception was splendid and our room was upgraded to a suite. Our suite was massive and more than my girlfriend and I would have ever needed a fun addition to our stay!    We had the all-inclusive package and the restaurant served a grand selection of food. They also catered to gluten intolerance with expert finesse having the chef point out what was gluten free and where there had been cross contamination. The restaurant was clean and the waiters service minded.    The pool area too was clean well maintained and the entertainment crew did their best to keep everyone happy (and in shape!).    The thing that keeps me from giving the hotel 5/5 was slightly less service minded bartenders. We waited 45 minutes for a couple of water bottles the first evening and eventually ended up asking in the reception only to be told that water bottles were given out at the bar.    One thing we also didn´t understand was wether or not the minibar in the rooms were included in the all inclusive package. When booking we read that the minibar was included but when we arrived we were told it wasn´t. Anyhow: those two minor things did not make our stay any less enjoyable. This hotel is really fantastic; and I would recommend anyone to stay here! Great location it´s clean great food!,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Oslo, Norway",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EddyB918

Kenzi Menara Palace,lauralovesfive wrote a review Aug 2018,50,Amazing hotel and Wonderfull staff!!,We arrived for a relaxing week at the end of May with a view to using the luxurious grounds and amenities of the hotel whilst having the great location close to the Atlas mountains and free shuttle service daily to and from the medina for our adventures - we could simply not have had a better weeks holiday anywhere!!!  We were greeted by Sherif the concierge who immediately put us at ease with his great personality and literally could not do enough for us all through our week - he spotted that I was pregnant and we were immediately upgraded to a huge (2 balcony 2 bathroom sitting room and master bed) suite close to the pool and we started our discussions about activities - I really wanted to get close to the people and culture in this wonderful country and Sherif even arranged for us to spend a morning cooking with his mother in law inside her actual home..... such an amazing experience and so unique but he couldn't do enough for us all week!! The amenities here are second to none the food and drinks are fresh well cooked and always had a huge variety to cater for all tastes - we did spend a couple of days sampling delights of the food markets in the medina which is just a must for the true culture side of things - during our week we also got chatting to our regular waiter Anas who also just could not do enough for us during our week - from reserved seating to fresh coffee and juice when we arrived to regular cocktails delivered to our cabana.....it was just amazing and he was truly happy to look after us - as were each and every staff member here this is why we love Morocco - the people are just so amazing!! Highly recommend this hotel if not just for Sherif and Anas who are just a credit to the hotel and wonderful people in general - but also for the amenities food drinks entertainment and location (I haven't even mentioned the pool and cabanas which were perfect!) We will definitely be back again soon - thanks so much!! xxx,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Burbage, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauraben2009
Kenzi Menara Palace,Natalie M wrote a review Aug 2018,30,"Average hotel, far from the 5* experience",We booked this holiday as a couples trip away in order to explore Marrakech. We didn't want to stay in central Marrakech due to the business and noise so decided to book a week stay at the Kenzi Manara Palace. This hotel is very close to the airport which was great except you did see/hear a fair few planes flying over the pool area.    The hotel concierge was exceptionally helpful in organising a private driver to take us to the Atlas Mountains and a sightseeing tour around Marrakech for a reasonable price too. The drivers didn't speak very good English however they tried very hard to communicate. One driver used google translate to communicate with us. The hotel also offers a free shuttle service to and from central Marrakech which was fantastic.    In terms of the hotel facilities there was a great spa. I arranged a Royal Hammam which was 500 dirhams (very good price) and was a fantastic experience. The balance of the hotel facilities had some way to go however. The hotel is an all inclusive hotel; the pool area was a bit strange as it is just one big pool so everyone sort of stares at one another and the rooms themselves were nice also. The main restaurant however was poorly run and not a great experience. The food was varied however I suffer from Coeliac Disease and had real trouble in finding out what I could eat. In my experience other hotels (4* upwards) have placards at each dish which provide a description of what the dish was together with the allergens. Luckily one of the chefs Rashid spoke very good English and took the time to talk through each dish with me. This was quite tiresome having to do this 3 times a day however he was the only chef who even understood what gluten/wheat was. Rashid saved the hotel experience for me! He also arranged corn bread to be ordered in and prepared for my meals the only issue with this was when Rashid wasn't around none of the other chefs would be prepared to assist. The dining hall itself was often left very dirty and the tables were not turned over very quickly which often lead to us sitting on a dirty table and having to try and find cutlery. The waiters would sometimes take the length of our entire meal to ask if we wanted a drink.    Another point was the continuing music being played (very loudly) all hours of the day by the pool. Eventually you are able to tune the music out however it did cause a few headaches to begin with.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/752nataliem

The hotel is very clean the rooms are cleaned to a high standard daily. We were upgraded to a pool view room it was beautiful and with one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in.  The pool was lovely and so nice to cool down in the warm summer. The sun lounger are very comfortable and you can collect your beach towel to use each day free of charge.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  There is a free shuttle bus to the centre which we availed of.  The breakfast is a buffet style with a wide selection.  Alcohol is very expensive in the hotel but it is expensive to drink alcohol in Marrakech.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahkbartley

Kenzi Menara Palace,sophie l wrote a review Jul 2018,40,Lovely few days away!!,Pros  Great service best location amazing food at the buffet and superb atmosphere around the pool. We also used the spa facilities and had a massage each which was also amazing. The rooms and complex was spotless too!    Cons  There is no iron in the room and you cant even borrow one from reception you have to pay for a laundry service which is a little bit cheeky considering how much you pay anyway to stay at the hotel. Bring your own travel iron as the service is not cheap.    Wasps are a problem which isnt the hotels fault however when food is out at the pool bar it would be a good idea to cover the food as no one could eat anything because they was swamped in flys.    Thank you for an amazing stay and i would 100% visit again.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Michelle71 wrote a review Jul 2018,50,Best Marrakech Resort,Absolutely excellent. I booked a family room and a single room and we were six people children aged 16 11 and 9 and a friend who booked her own room. We booked all inclusive. Highly recommended.    This is my fourth visit to Marrakech and my third in a resort type hotel. After the last two visits to such resorts which were poor I had low expectations and was unsure why I had rebooked a resort in Marrakech in the first place but I was to be pleasantly surprised. It was lovely.    The family room was a suite with a large double bed and two single beds placed in the living room area the two extra beds would not be fit for older children but fine for the two little ones.    The rooms were large clean with lovely views of the gardens whether you’re at the front or the back. Super comfortable beds good air con and a bath and a good shower.    The pool was huge and there were always plenty of sun beds and towels. Plenty of little chill out areas around the hotel.    The gent who was in charge of entertainment Hassan was lovely and worked hard through out the day and could remember any name he was a credit to the hotel. The kids joined in a few activities but were never pressurised if they didn’t fancy it.    Before arrival I had emailed Jihad as it was important that the family room and single room were close by and this was indeed the case perfectly across the hall from each other.    The food in the inclusive was flavoursome and endless throughout the day with three boys never going hungry. The service in the restaurant was always faultless again the restaurant staff were amazing.    We used the shuttle into old town which was very convenient and caught a taxi back. A taxi to menara mall which was nearby and has a floor dedicated to kid related activities.    I would stay again.    My one frustration is the check in process I knew I was too early for check in and was more than happy to stay by the pool until 2pm. But they say come back in an hour so I don’t bother getting into my swimwear and start relaxing proper for an hour to come back be told wait another hour. Its so hot and your around a pool with the kids in your jeans. I’ve come to realise there is this thing called ‘Moroccan time’ where whatever they say is usually an infinite amount of time and they are rarely on time or early. She was apologetic and said she would come to find me in the end as I thought this could go on for an a few more times.    Otherwise best resort style hotel in Marrakech don’t bother with the others!,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michelle71
Kenzi Menara Palace,scoutsingas wrote a review Jul 2018,40,Great value luxury in a spacious and peaceful setting,"We recently spent 4 nights at this resort hotel in Marrakech. We opted for the all inclusive deal and this was super value as there was great variety in the food offerings and for a small stipend you could avail of the "" speciality"" restaurants. We didn't feel the need to do this as there was so much on offer in the main buffet. The pool is magnificent and the pool staff were very obliging in organising umbrellas towels and activities. There is a free shuttle into the medina in the evenings with a designated drop off and pick up point two hours later which is very handy. Our room was comfortable and clean although the noise from the nightly disco which went on until 12 midnight was an issue. Perhaps there are other quieter rooms and this is something worth investigating if you are not at the nightclub yourself. In general the staff were friendly and obliging although it did seem as if there was some evident discontent between them at times on the dining room floor- and we were there a lot!  Overall this is a good value option for relaxing and resting and use as a base for sightseeing in the wider vicinity although this is something you might want to arrange independently.",Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scoutsingas
Kenzi Menara Palace,stevebintley wrote a review Jul 2018,50,Superb rooms and great pool,I can highly recommend the Menara Palace especially if you’re looking for a relaxing break which doesn’t come with the noise and bustle of the city centre. I took advantage of the hotel’s transfer option upon arrival at the airport and although it’s no more than a ten minute drive I’m glad I had a knowledgeable driver who was able to give advice for my visit in fluent English. Pulling up at the entrance even relatively late in the evening everything was naturally taken care of and the friendly reception desk completed proceedings quickly.    I had the delight of being allocated a top third floor room with a pool view. A member of staff escorted me to the room which I was grateful of since it initially felt like maze and was a lot larger than I was expecting. The interior of all the corridors is a minimalistic style but very pretty broken up with open air plantation sections.    The room was very impressive and I would certainly recommend paying the slight extra for a pool view. The room was so spacious complete with sofa and arm chain desk massive bed and lots of storage space along with wardrobe in a separate section of the room. Lots of lighting options which could be controlled from the bed along with electric sockets at both sides of the bed added to the comfort levels. There were tea and coffee facilities as well as a mini bar. The huge french doors and window opened up to a spacious balcony with table and chairs. Outdoor lights made this space useable late at night too. The thick curtains were very effective at blocking out the light in the mornings and although music from the pool could occasionally be heard it was never early enough to be disturbing.    The bathroom was equally as spacious as the main room with two sinks a separate large bath and shower cubicle as well as a toilet and bidet in another room. Towels and gowns were present although I couldn’t find any slippers. The toiletries came in small bottles but were keep restocked well and the shower had decent power as well as getting hot quickly. Upon arrival it was a real treat for the towels to be displayed beautifully with one on the floor by the shower complete with rose petals. Although turndown service didn’t repeat this again they always returned and were good at observing the do not disturb sign.    The room was lovely for my three night stay and admiring the clear blue water of the pool below never got tiring. What was a shame was that there was no guide to the hotel facilities within the room. An overview of the dining options how the pool worked entertainment in the evening etc was all missing which resulting in making the most of my stay harder. The TV was also rather difficult to use and temperamental requiring a channel change to restore a frozen picture regularly. Most frustrating though was the wifi which didn’t work very well at all. The rest of the hotel wasn’t as bad so I assume the room was maybe on the edges of the signal but don’t expect to achieve much if you’re in a room at the ends of the property. It just gave me a good excuse to work by the pool though!    Breakfast is included and quite a large set up. There’s a lot of range in the buffet and remained well stocked. Traditional meats and fruits hot dishes pastries and a range of fruit juices were all present. There’s also a counter with freshly made sweet items should you need a morning sugar fix. No dishes made to order were available which I could see and hot drinks are also self service. There’s plenty of seating both inside and outside which is nice and the staff were good at clearing plates etc. Service ends promptly at 10:30 which encourages you not to lay in too long!    Clearly the main selling point for this hotel is it’s outdoor pool and rightly so! There’s actually two pools with a smaller one which is heated in the cooler months. There’s loads of sun loungers around the pool a decent number of cabanas for at least two people as well as beanbags on the grass and a number of tables surrounding. Towels are provided from a hut alongside the DJ which plays non obtrusive music in the afternoon. The huge pool has steps down at the top and a shallow section at the opposite end next to the restaurant / bar. Given the number of people working there its a shame they don’t offer service to the sun beds and to be honest the service from the bar itself is a little slow but overall everyone was friendly and the food available is good for lunch with reasonable prices. It was all served quickly and presented well with portion sizes suitable for a lunch time.    There’s a nice lounge area behind the main reception desk which had evening music next door to the hotel’s bar. The bar had some nice seating a varied menu and also some outdoor tables which were waited on. Crisps nuts and olives were brought with the drinks giving a high end feel and with the live music it was a nice relaxing place.    There’s three main restaurants in the hotel and I had the pleasure of trying two for dinner during my visit. The first specialising in Italian food was pretty quite on the Tuesday evening but the staff were friendly and the food served in good time. The semolina soup starter was different but tasty as well as being presented well. Unfortunately a basket of bread arrived after I’d finished it which was a shame and the veal steak with tagliatelle main was cooked well but the pasta felt it has been sat for a little while. Given the fact the quietness resulted in a lacking atmosphere it was an average meal but dinner in the Moroccan restaurant the following night was much better! An authentic setting with low sofas and live traditional ude music gave a fantastic experience. There was a good range on the menu and my starter although not as I expected was delicious and filling in itself. The traditional tagine main was one of a few options but didn’t disappoint. A really enjoyable evening and a meal I would love to repeat on my future visit; except for the creme brûlée desert which was horrible!    When it came to checking out I was certainly sad to be leaving. I didn’t have the opportunity to take advantage of many of the services and facilities such as the lovely spa and shuttle service to the city but this makes me determined to return again. I had a really relaxing break here and while it’s not perfect the room was really impressive and I felt it was great value for money. If you’re looking for a pool and somewhere to unwind here should certainly be on your shortlist!,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Bedford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevebintley
Kenzi Menara Palace,hunnyx wrote a review Jul 2018,20,"If you want something done, do it yourself.",Group of 3 girls travelling; we arrived Sunday afternoon for an all inclusive stay. The hotel is only as good as it’s staff.    Location:  The location of the hotel was great 15 minutes away from the airport and 15 minutes away from the main souk Jamma El Fna the hotel also offers free shuttle services to the souk but please take into consideration how long you will want to spend at the souk as the shuttle bus does not run very frequently.    Souk:  Dress appropriately for the souk as you the locals will stare. Do not go off with anyone who offers to show you around as they will rip you off!! We did not do this ourselves however certain people in our hotel was ripped off.    Hotel amenities:  Pool and pool bar was great very clean. Our room was cleaned morning and in general all the restaurants were lovely.    Service:  However the service was diabolical. From the moment we arrived we did not received the welcome that everyone has praised about on trip advisor. We were advised to fill out some forms that we had no help with as it was in French and none of the front of house staff bothered explaining what we were meant to fill out although they did offer us a welcome drink. When we got to our hotel room the room was not ready! They haven’t made up the extra bed there was only 2 towels in the room and 1 bathroom the toiletries were not a complete set and there were no tea/coffee and mugs. When we rang up reception to let them know we were advised someone was coming to make the room up however they did not arrive to do this until after we have had lunch which was an hour and half after we had arrived. We also did not receive our suitcases at this time and again we walked back to reception and called the reception for our suitcases and we were told they were coming and will be with us soon after lunch they were still not in our room and we had to collect them ourselves as the staff just left our suitcases in a cupboard. The service was like this all the way through our stay in the restaurant there was absolutely no table service we had to ask for our drinks and they took their time to see us/ serve us the drinks this happened every time. On several occasions we finished our meals before we were seen to. We also saw a lot of people get pool side service and again no one asked us most of the time we were ignored by the staff at the hotel. The cleaners also came into our room without knocking at 9AM and then when we said ‘no’ to a clean they replaced our towels anyways! Another cleaner then came in 10 minutes after and again we said ‘no’ and they replied with ‘just topping up the minibar’ not sure if this is the ettiequte in Morocco but certainly not from a resort that claims to be 5 stars.  We realised staff were a lot more accommodating if you spoke their language or French they were not very welcoming to 3 English females even though they claim to be an international hotel they do not treat ‘international’ guests with the same respect as their French or Moroccan guests.    Taxis:  We paid 300 Dirhams from the airport to get to the hotel although this was a rip off if you are in a mood for bartering you can probably get this down to 150 dirhams. Also would advice you to agree a price before getting into a taxi. As we were leaving the front of house told us that 100dirhams was more than enough to get us into the airport although when we got into the taxi the taxi man did not want to accept 100 dirhams and wanted more.    This was my second visit to Marrakech and my friends first visit and I can honestly say the service in my first hotel was so much better. Overall the hotel was nice although the staff did not make the stay as enjoyable as it could be. I would recommend that you stay with a Thomas Cook/ Thompson approved hotel as they were a lot more accommodating to international guests than the staff at Kenzi Menara.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Hitchin, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hunnyx

We stayed in suprior room and it’s was beautiful. The atmosphere here is super relaxing and staff is helpful and nice with whatever you ask.    We upgraded the first day to all inclusive after first thinking of only having breakfast but it’s better with drinks and lunch by the pool when it’s free.    The breakfast is great drinks are great a la carte is great their could be some improvements of the dinners that need a bit more taste and variation but otherwise okay for a couple of days.    We went to spa massage I got my hair done with balayage and it’s was really good job by the hairdresser of the hotel.    The gym is great for a small run and afternoon workout with their personal trainer.    I must say one of the best experiences was our tennis morning sessions with the hotel personal trainer Salah he is indeed super great coach very fun and professional we were so happy about it and so amazed after the sessions.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Eileen S wrote a review Jul 2018,50,Beautiful Hotel and Complex,Just returned from a week at this resort. Hotel Rooms Pool Complex and Gardens were beautiful. Could not find fault. Staff were all polite and courteous at all times. All Inclusive is a must and as much Wine Beer Water and Minerals as you wish for with each meal. Lots of food choices too at each meal. Chef was on hand with his recommendations and explanations of dishes. We were well looked after in the dining room by our charming and friendly waiter Anquar. Nothing was a problem. By the pool we had Aqua Aerobics and Pool Volleyball everyday with Amine. He was a pleasure and invited all guests to partake in the activities. Its a very family orientated hotel therefore quiet after dinner. Not too many partaking in the evening entertainment but we enjoyed the music each evening until bar closing at 11.30pm.  On the down side - Birds are flying around the uneaten food on tables both inside and outside before the waiters get to clear away. I didnt see anyone make an issue so it must be acceptable practise in Marrakesh but I wasnt comfortable with it.  Overall I would have no problem recommending this hotel to my friends and family .,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Kilkenny,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EileenS57

We weren't very happy with our first room but we immediately got another room. With poolside view! Great service. We enjoyed our stay very much.  Things that could be better are the maintenance of the building. Painting was old and releasing. Beds at the pool were not all good. Too bad That would me the hotel so much nicer! And the food was not every day as good as the other day. For example the cheese was dry and pancakes were withered.

Kenzi Menara Palace was a great option and I'm so happy we stayed here. The pool is amazing and not crowded at all even though the hotel was fully booked when we stayed there. The staff was actually very friendly and useful and not what I expected at all since before our trip I read some reviews saying the staff was horrible.    The rooms are spacious and clean. The bathroom is almost like the size of one room in other hotels haha.    There's lots of food to choose from if you have the all-inclusive or half-board option. Great drinks from the bar. There's a FREE shuttle to the city 6 or 7 times a day. It's like 10 minutes to the airport and to the medina so it's in a great location. And oh the spa is also great!

I have to say the stay was super pleasant and everything was great. Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful our room was really nice with our own balcony we upgraded to All Inclusive during our stay and we got to enjoy the food which we liked very much (i must have ate tens of those cakes they served for dessert on each meal). Pool was great there was a pool-guy creating activity like water aerobics and stuff which I also participated in a couple times. Gym is pretty small but it has everything you need to get a little vacation pump on. We had our fair share of drinks while watching football games in the lobby which had big TV screens. Oh and the wi-fi worked great everywhere inside the hotel area room pool gym you name it.    And we cant thank the staff enough because they let us keep our room on our last day all the way to 15pm and we got to keep our all inclusive bracelets on that day too all the way until we left the hotel.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkoB1252
Kenzi Menara Palace,misdp wrote a review Jun 2018,50,The best luxury hotel ever,Having read the reviews i was a bit anxious about wheher to choose this hotel. I’m so glad we choose Kenzi menera palace as it was just amazing and I fell in love with the place. It’s most definately 5 star from the moment you step into the reception. The morrocan aroma just hits you. The reception staff fadila and Selma were always accommodating and friendly. Sous chef Rachid always had a friendly smile was accommodating and made us feel at home by always offering and explaining the different food items. This place felt like home where everyone was so friendly. The o-spa is just amazing and they had good deals on. The quality and standard of the rooms was amazing. We stayed in room 172 which was perfect for us to get to the pool main reception and bar area. They have theme nights and the bbq night was just so amazing. I would recommend this hotel to everyone who wants luxury cleanliness and a 5 star service. It’s close to the airport menera mall Médina and basically everything you would want to do. You can also relax by the pool benefit from fresh towels and refreshing drinks. We are definately coming back very soon to this hotel.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Lloydb07 wrote a review May 2018,10,Not a 5* Hotel,This hotel is not a 5* hotel and the majority staff are extremely unhelpful. 3* at a push.    We booked an all-inclusive package with lastmintue.com (if you are thinking of booking with them don't!) for a week and we totally regretted doing so.    Unfortunately a family member of mine passed away a week before we were meant to go on holiday and the funeral fell bang in the middle of our stay. I provided all documents of proof of the death as requested and Lastmintue promised to change the dates of the hotel and flights. A million promises to call back and emails they told us there isn't anything they could do and nothing would be changed 24 hours before flying. Their customer services are unbelievably shocking and don't care in the slightest about their customers. We then agreed to go on the holiday as we didn't want to lose out on everything we paid but this meant buying extra flights extra hotels back in the UK to then fly on to Jersey where the funeral was held.    When we arrived i explained everything to the reception and they offered us an upgrade…. the room we received was facing the main road and was so far away from the main part of the hotel with the wifi not working. We reported this several times and were promised a member of staff would come to the room. This never happened. Bathroom wasn't pleasant with a leak coming from the loo and the bath had crack and stains.    Restaurant and bar:    The food was terrible and bland. A few options but nothing but tasteless. In the restaurant there were birds flying around and pooing on the seats not mentioning eating from the buffet. Me and my partner found this discussing as anyone would and the staff didn't care or seem to change this. Staff would come around offering to take a drink order in the lunch and evening meals. Coke lemonade or any soft drink would be poured straight from the warm plastic bottle and not even served with ice lemon or lime. 5* service?? Don't think so. One of the themed restaurants (Italian) was also closed for that we weren't informed of before arriving. This was disappointing as the food was so bad in the buffet it would have been nice to have another option. Breakfast was seriously lacking and was again very poor we ended up eating the bread rolls to fill us up. Coffee machine was broken once again birds flying around. Not nice and a really uncomfortable experience. After eating in the restaurant one night we agreed to not eat there again and ended up eating out every night. Waste of our money as we paid for all inclusive.    The drinks at the bar poolside and restaurant were disgusting. Cheapest sprites warm watered down and the cocktails were shocking! Me and my partner ordered a mojito cocktail from the bar and it was so bad we had to go to the toilets to chuck it away. First time I’ve ever had to do that. Wrong ingratiates and poorly made with a lack of care and detail you would expect from a cocktail in a 5* hotel.    Near the bar they had some ''entertainment'' from a guy dressed like Michael Jackson teaching the older crowd to dance. Not to our taste. Was cheap looking.    We started to really dislike the hotel so much so we went out as much as possible.    When leaving the hotel on Wednesday I arranged a private transfer from the hotel to the airport at 15:10 to get us to the airport in plenty of time to check in our bags and get on the flight. Due to the poor service and the lack of trust built I rang to double check. They said it would be coming at 16:40…. this was already paid and was too late for us to get to the airport. We explained to the reception team and they laughed and said ''you will have time you can get a taxi if you want''. I was so angry and got a transfer sorted within 10 minutes. When we got to the airport they told us they overbooked the flight and that 6 people wouldn't board. I once again explained my situation with the funeral and the importance of getting this flight. Luckily we got on but if the hotel picked us up at 16:40 we wouldn't have. Appalling and no care in the matter.    I would strongly advise you to stay away from this hotel and book something smaller with more attention to detail.,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lloydb07

The staff were pretty much unavailable as even if they were there they didn’t want to help. They would roll there eyes at you if you asked for something.  There was an ongoing smell of urine in every part of the hotel especially as you walked into the spa. The spa itself was very far from luxurious it was not well kept and seemed pretty unclean which was a shame.  The food wasn’t great at all the smell of the kitchen was enough to make you heave and at breakfast when we asked for milk with our tea which was served hot they just took a jug off another table from previous guests and put it on our table. This is unacceptable who knows how long that had been sitting there.  The front desk are rude nobody seems to know what they are doing and they charged me on arrival for my stay and on check out so now I have 2 pending payments for a large about of money which is incorrect. Nobody showed us around the hotel on arrival to know where anything was and although we payed all inclusive there was nobody ever around to serve people. There was no service around the pool and the shelves were pretty much empty. I was very disappointed with this stay and will not be revisiting.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Jollybo wrote a review May 2018,20,Definitely not 5 star,We booked this hotel as a golf package through Golf Breaks.com on the belief that this was a 5 star resort which it is definitely not. The hotel mainly caters for the French market so if you can speak the language it does help. The hotel looks very nice however the maintenance & attention to some basic detail is poor with broken floor tiles & steps mouldy grouting in bathrooms bird droppings on furniture and smelly drains in showers. The dining experience i thought was below average at best although the other members of the party all thought it was poor main reasons were the temperature of the food (not hot even when getting to the dining room at opening time) lack of flavour having to ask for cutlery & crockery as the tables weren’t set up correctly or was dirty birds flying around the dining room all the above may have contributed why our party had very upset stomachs for 2 days (we had not eaten anywhere else!) As our flight was leaving early we asked if we could have breakfast at 6am which reception said ask for room service which we could have complimentary which we thought was extremely good of them however although making it very clear that we needed to leave the total at 6.30am so we needed the breakfast at 6am by 6.25am when we checked out it had still not arrived. I informed reception but their attitude was “oh well”  Generally the staff were very friendly although the pool barman was an exception to this as he was more interested in the pay as you go clients rather than the all inclusive as we were (tips?) The concierge we felt overcharged us as when we booked directly with the taxi driver on the same trip it was a 1/3 cheaper so whether there was some deal going on who knows. The concierge was definitely upset when we told him we didn’t need him to book us a taxi again as we had booked directly with the driver.  A word of advice to all golfers if your transfers to the golf courses are not included in your package you are looking at London prices for the cabs and beers at the golf clubs are very high ranging from £7.50 to £9 a 330ml bottle for Casablanca local beer,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jollybo

The room is fantastic and so spacious the whole hotel is spotless including the pool and eating areas. The food is great something for everyone with amazing tagines every night tasty meats and a fab salad selection for vegetarians. We were all inclusive and the food selection for all 3 meals is great.    I’ve seen a few people on here moaning about the pool being “too cold” which just shows a lot of people like to find the negatives instead of the positives it’s fine once you’re in and I find it very cooling in 30 degree heat if you’re that unhappy move to the other heated pool!!    The staff were so lovely from start to finish. Especially the gentleman in the Moroccan restaurant I think his name was Reda which was absolutely excellent truly authentic Moroccan experience. The staff were nice enough to give us late checkout for free as our flight wasn’t until 10pm.    The shuttle bus to the center of Marrakech is so convinient and free of charge.    The only things I would point out would be the ironing as we paid for this service despite the polo shirt having no difference after it being returned.    Also we paid for all inclusive which was fantastic however they do charge extra for other cocktails and spirits such as Jack Daniels. However the spirits included in the all inclusive were great and the measures were never short.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Kristian_Youness wrote a review May 2018,30,"Good facilities, bad service",Generally the facilities of the hotel are quite good. Beautiful garden and pool area with the smaller  of the two pools heated. Our room was large and generally well  appointed but could do with a bit of paint. The reason I only give 3/5 is the service from start to finish. Not 5-star at all. Examples:  - Check-in staff not welcoming or smiling at all. Just robotic asked us to sit down to fill in some forms didn’t provide a pen to do so. Only (but important) plus: they gave us a nice room after some negotiation.  - Breakfast: Large buffet with fairly good choice but service very poor. Waiters replied several times rudely to guests e.g. when asking for cutlery or coffee. Half of the tables were not dressed or were left dirty for up to an hour. Seemed like they were understaffed or poorly organised.  When I asked for scrambled eggs at the egg station I was told that I could not have it as I could just take the (industrial) scrambled eggs at the self-service buffet. No thanks. There was no line so it was not because they were busy. When I asked a second time they made the scrambled eggs.  - Pool: They ran out of fresh towels around 2pm. New guests could not have any until 3pm. Staff told  us that it was not their fault. Well it wasn’t out fault either. We just had a minimum of expectations from a 5-star hotel.  - Bar: When asking for a coffee from the bar at 11.40pm we were told that they would make it for us but they were actually closed. The bar  closes at midnight. Thanks for the special gesture. Many reviewers complain about the smoking inside. I’m not difficult with smoking but I agree that it has no place inside anymore.  - Room: Great cleaning staff very friendly but they did not stock  up on water or coffee. Please knock before entering.    If you read other reviews from  me you will see that I am not someone who is very critical or difficult in general. However this hotel needs to improve its service. The no-water-from-outside policy is just ridiculous.

Kenzi Menara Palace,steveBray wrote a review May 2018,50,GREAT VALUE HOTEL,We are four well travelled golfers and were recommended Marrakesh as an economic destination by Golf Breaks.  The Hotel was 'All Inclusive' and was very good value. We enjoyed the wine particularly the Rose. Plus drinks before and after diner. A unique experience was when one of the team requested a Brandy. The resultant measure was more than he could drink. A first!  Rooms were very spacious and comfortable. Staff all helpful and attentive. Plus of course with AI - we spent very little. The Hotel even agreed that we could have Lunch on the day of departure even after we had checked out.  The Golf was also good - two great Courses one not so. (Maybe more to do with our skill levels).  The Airport is brand new and very stylish. However the immigration bureaucracy results in huge delays on arrival (1 hour plus). We (fortunately) had been warned and paid Pearl Assist $20.00 for their 'Fastrack' service. It was brilliant - we were through and into Arrivals within 10 mins. Worth every penny.  Also rented Clubs from Clubs to Hire (used before) - via local agent Jamal Kibir. Excellent - good clubs - great service - highly recommended.  For a different Golf trip (having done Spain & Portugal to death) this is highly recommended.

Kenzi Menara Palace,gmuk24 wrote a review May 2018,10,3rd visit and absolutely appalled with my stay.,I arrived in Marrakech quite late as it was a late flight from Manchester. on arrival at the airport i was then made aware with my TUI rep that i would not be staying at Kenzi Menara this may or may not be the hotels fault however some email with an apology or an update would have been greatly appreciated.  So the next day after spending a night in a hotel on my own in an unknown area. I arrived at KENZI no big welcome to the hotel. I checked in. no apology. I then got shoved in the back of the hotel where the room was overlooking the bins from the back of the hotel. My patio door was broken and i could not open it to let some fresh air inside. This did get fixed however is not the point after having an already bad experience to my first holiday in Morocco alone. i normally visit with my mum.  I was not told about new charges to the mini bar (i did not touch them as no prices were allocated when checking in) i noticed this was new.  The next day i asked if it would be possible to move rooms as i have stayed before and i was not at all happy with the room i was allocated.  They said they could the following day.  The following day i went back again to reception and they said 'they will call my room'. 45 minutes waiting in my room and no phone call. Went back to reception 'this is not possible'. It is fine if you have no other rooms available i understand you may be busy but the staff were ever so rude at reception and not even willing to help.    on departure i requested when my transfer would be picking me up from the hotel the concierge was rude and abrupt and was adamant that i was not flying with TUI when infact after showing my boarding pass he still thought i was wrong.  He told me to be down for 8pm (even though my flight wasnt till 00:15) so already thought this was wrong but did not question this rude gentlemen.  No thankyou for visiting on departure. I have noticed a lot of staff have gone and the new staff in fact were not helpful polite or apologetic.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Syed Nazim A wrote a review May 2018,20,Worst Service Ever Encountered,I am on the road for business travel (i.e. stay in hotel rooms) for 4-6 months a year and the Kenzie Menara is the worst hotel I’ve ever experienced.    We stayed at the Kenzi Menara for five nights and in that stretch had multiple encounters that strongly lead to me not recommending this hotel especially for people bringing families.    The hotel condition is OK at best the TV screen is large but doesn’t let you navigate so pretty useless. We had a bathtub tile just randomly fall. Wall plug near the dresser hanging off. The hotel lobby deeply smells of smoke not great with kids.    The worst part of the Kenzi Menara is the service to customers. So many interactions where we just felt they wanted to be difficult instead of helpful.    For example we needed to feed our son for dinner asked if they could expedite a 30-minute estimated time to delivery instead we ended up waiting one hour for our son’s food.    They throw away water bottles in the rooms if they’re not from the hotel yet they forgot to provide their own daily re-stock. When I called one day instead of offering water the staffer said maybe you had a Do Not Disturb sign outside the door; had to explain to the contrary the sign on the door was to make up the room.    Half way through our key cards didn’t work which was another struggle to replace with the front desk asking useless questions and me having to ask for a second copy even after I explained neither my wife or my key worked.    They also nickel-and-dime so instead of providing irons and ironing boards you need to send clothing for their laundry service where they’ll charge you USD 3 to iron a dress shirt.    I’ve never stayed at a place where every encounter with staff felt like they’re going out of their way to be difficult.    Based on the feedback to other reviews on TripAdvisor for the Kenzie Menara they’ll write back saying “sorry / regret to hear about your experience we hope you give us a chance in the future” ... no thanks Kenzie Menara — instead why don’t you take the effort to train your teams on what good service looks like and stop trying to nickel-and-fine your customers.,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Singapore, Singapore",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SyedNazimA1
Kenzi Menara Palace,Elena R wrote a review May 2018,30,"Do not expect anything extra, good hotel for decent money",This was our first visit of Morocco we spent 6 nights in that hotel.    Cons:  - the hotel is simply old. You could see it everywhere heavily worn furniture bathrooms etc.  - The choice of food is not very exciting  - Spa: I am speechless here one needs to reserve a sauna in advance for extra cost 100MAD per person for only 30min! It was not hot at all and the interior is not very nice at all. The shower did not work so we had to use another one located in the swimming pool area.  - Service: Slow  - You could smell the smoking everywhere as there are a lot people smoking inside of the hotel    Pros:    - there is a free of charge shuttle service taking you to the city center of Marrakesh  - the proximity of the hotel to the city center  - rooms are clean and spacious  - towels are changed every day  - bath robes are provided,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Prague, Czech Republic",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D4034YQelenar

Kenzi Menara Palace,Kmarys wrote a review May 2018,40,Great place to relax and enjoy amazing winter sunshine....,Stayed at the the Kenzi 13th-20th April a lovely hotel for a relaxing break in peaceful surroundings although still close enough to the local attractions and less than 10 minutes from the airport. The huge pool and gardens are stunning with the snow capped Atlas mountains in the background. The pool view room was very spacious along with all the other areas in the hotel. The pool area was very well laid out with plenty of loungers as well as 20+ daybeds and parasols for people seeking shade from the sun.The food was good with plenty of variety and all the staff were very friendly. The gym had mainly Mattrix equipment cross trainer stepper rowing machines as well as weights so enough for a good workout. Didn't find the need for local currency as the euro was widely accepted in the hotel and outside. The staff are a credit to the hotel very friendly and accommodating. Ask the conciege about organising a personalised trip to include places you would like to visit and he'll arrange a guide and driver would definitely recommend. A special mention has to go go Amine for his passion and enthusiasm for what he does and what doesn't he do..... Salsa dancing lessons cooking lessons volleyball kids club basically everything activity. In summary a wonderful stay (week) at the Kenzi in lovely surroundings where everything exceeded my expectations would definitely return in the future.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Peterborough, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kmarys
Kenzi Menara Palace,dpr0ud wrote a review Apr 2018,30,Recent stay,Second visit to this hotel.  This hotel is a global British brand owned by Thomas Cook where it feels like you are treated like a second class guest just for being British. Ignored in the restaurantexample - asked for English tea the older man in the grey suit just looked at me brought over the tea with no milk I asked for some milk he said in a very sturn voice CORNFLAKES MILK then he followed behind me to see if I had found the milk for my tea ! In a cup as there were no jugs . I felt he was being difficult.  I watched him greet other guests  shaking hands pulling out chairs refilling there mint tea.No surprise there are not many British guests.  Bar - served other guests first NEVER offered waiting service just ignored again.  The only staff who make you feel welcome are cherif amine.  T.v did not work no signal  reported asked for help no one bothered to come to sort this problem out.  The housekeeping kept taking the towels and not replacing them till later on in the day  Meaning you could not take a shower very irritating.  Probably would not stay again.  Disappointed.

I stayed less than 24hrs as part of a cycling tour but got to experience a few amenities. The room was quiet with a nice balcony view. The room was a bit of a walk through numerous courtyards from the entrance and some poorly lit areas.    Food quality was high and service was attentive. Breakfast was well stocked although the coffee maker needed some tuning.

Kenzi Menara Palace,infoC4427VI wrote a review Apr 2018,50,It doesn’t get much better than this...,So after a hicup on our first day which i reviewed and then removed things got a LOT better. Upon check-in we had a minor disagreement with management but this was rectified in the best possible way the following day and what an amazing stay it turned out to be. I cannot praise the Head of Concierge - Sheriff and the Manager - Yasin enough. Both went WAY above and beyond their jurisdictions to ensure we were not left unhappy by the earlier mishap. Sheriff and Yasin both sincerely apologised and we were given complimentary access to the spa and massage facilities an upgrade to a Premium Suite and Yasin had gone out of his way to personally purchase gifts for us as a gesture of appreciation for our constant returning custom. This is THE ONLY hotel we will ever reside at during our future trips to Marrakech and I highly recommend it to anyone reading this review - the staff here will NEVER leave you disappointed. Sheriff is the most clean hearted and welcoming person you will ever come across! The service the food the facilities the rooms the cleanliness are all impeccable at Kenzi Menara. I will be forwarding my comments to the Hotel Director Mrs Jamili following this review.

The rooms are covered every day and there is always some special nightgown design.:)  The hamman and massage will be an eternal experience for me.

Kenzi Menara Palace,RashZ4 wrote a review Apr 2018,40,Good hotel but not a 5*,Me and a friend stayed here last month for 3 nights the hotel is close to the airport and around 10 minutes drive to Jemaa el-Fnaa.    During our stay the hotel was quiet as it was out of season. The hotel is rated as a 5* complex however this was probably a good 4* and nowhere near the 5* rating.    We booked a standard double room with pool view first impressions were great. The room was a good size with 2 X twin beds.    On a closer look we noticed some defects and cracks on the walls as well as general redecorating required.  The bath facilities were great and huge we had a bath tub and separate walk in shower. The W/C was within a separate room with a bidet.    The Air Con was not working spoke with reception and they advise that they are in winter mode and to leave the patio doors open. Not great the hotel should really look at implementing a building management system.    The hotel grounds were very nice decorated in a traditional Moroccan Moorish style.  The food at the hotel was ok and not amazing. There was not a huge selection but enough.    On our first night we were given a table my friend and I went to get our food and on return our table was given to someone else. We were ushered to another table. When we asked the waiter what they were playing at he could not understand me and pointed to his manager. I requested the manager and he avoided us for the whole meal. As it was our first night i didn't want to cause an issue and thought this was an over sight and things would be normal going forward.    The table we were sat at had a wobbly leg so they wedged this for us but it still wobbled. They had entertainment during the meal with a traditional Moroccan folk band. To be honest it was loud and noisy when you are trying to have a meal. It was more of a racket then music.    We found out that the hotel provides laundry service the cost was disgusting. We used a local service for peanuts. The hotel charged 100 dirhams for 1 shirt to be pressed and i got this locally done for 10 dirhams. What a rip off.    The Spa is expensive best to try a local place. We were told at checking we get a free spa so when we went to book we were told it was just to use the sauna. You need to ensure you Reception team provide the correct information.  There are so many hammam places in Marrakesh so book one of those for a third of the price..    The main pool was not heated so not used by many guests. There is a smaller pool by the side of the bar which was heated.    The cocktails were ok and served a range of beers cocktails and hot beverages. The Morrocan tea is a must.    The hotel staff we in their own world inadequate customer service skills by all of them. The only staff member who actually had some hospitality skills was Rabbab at the Bar. Rabbab is a credit to the hotel and management should use her as an example of how service is to be provided. If you go to the bar ask for Rabbab.    In summary this hotel is ok with much work required from the management of the hotel and staff to the facilities. In my opinion this hotel is not worth the current cost per night. We paid a large sum which for Morocco is expensive and even compares to prices more expensive than London's 4* hotels.    I regret to say that i would only stay in Kenzi Menara if prices reflect the hotel. There is so much to do and stay in marrakech but i leave you to make up your own mind.,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RashZ4

Kenzi Menara Palace,Ryan Nile wrote a review Mar 2018,40,"Great service, not much to fault",My trip didn't get off to the best start as our Airport transfer arrived an hour late however when I got to the hotel Shariff the head concierge was apologetic and literally ran around after me and the other guests. My room was very large with a good garden view. The only drawback is there is no airconditioning there are centrally controlled fans but I did not find this to be effective.  The hotel facilities are good with the quiet pools and amazing atlas mountain views. The spa is good and the hamaam treatments were nice.  Shariff sorted out a personal tour guide for Marrakech including cabs a camel ride and Atlas Mountain tours - yes I could have done this direct for cheaper but I prefer having left the hotel with my activities 'taken care of'. Shariff went above and beyond to make sure my stay was comfortable and I got to do the things I wanted in my short trip (4 days).  The food options were good however could be repetitive after a few days.  The hotel is located 10-15 mins from the airport and from the old city so is really convenient. The alcohol options are good and the general decor of the hotel lobby is brilliant.

From the time walked into the front door we were greeted with smiles and a drink while we completed forms for our stay!  The staff there are very helpful. In some cases they will go out of their way to help you when you least expect it.  I had a suite overlooking the pool. It was huge!! Definitely bigger than my apartment at home!! Very comfortable and more than enough space for one person!  We had the all inclusive option. The food varied somewhat every day and was very good for the most part. I think we had one bad day when the selection was OK not brilliant. But towards the end of the trip I was fed up of eating! Gluttony a horrible thing! LOL!  The servers were always taking care of us. Especially Nadia during the dinner service. It got to the stage where she would have our table ready with drinks for 7 of us when we arrived!  The burger at the poolside restaurant is to die for! I swear one of the best burgers I've eaten period!  I loved the fact they had cabana style beds by the pool at no additional cost! That was my spot where I crashed when the sun came out!  All in all a wonderful experience and definitely a resort I would highly recommend and return to.  If there was anything to complain about it was the WiFi. I noticed I would get virtually nothing when I was in the bedroom but a good signal in the living room. My brother fortunately had a repeater box right outside his room so his signal was strong!  I wasn't impressed with the spa. I booked for a manicure and to be honest I've had better at the regular nail salons in the strip malls. Not worth the money however the spa treatment prices are pretty cheap compared to prices in the US. My brother had a massage and enjoyed it. I also used the sauna and indoor pool. Very good for relaxing!  The other disappointing factor was the concierge. He didn't have a clue about anything! Maybe his English was not good and things got lost in translation but there were things that were pretty obvious and he got it wrong big time!  Despite those small setbacks I would gladly go back sip a cocktail by the pool admire the Atlas Mountains and relax!

Elegant manicured grounds surround this sprawling resort hotel that features shops multiple eateries and large comfortable rooms. Our room — though not a suite — was really more like an apartment complete with separate seating area bathroom suite coffee and tea-making area and outdoor patio. There is one caveat that might be helpful to some travelers with mobility issues: Because the Menara Palace is such a sprawling low-rise resort some rooms are a longish walk to the restaurants and lobby area passing through courtyards exposed to the outdoors. If you do have mobility issues you might want to book a room closer to the lobby.

We were not disappointed. The hotel is truly excellent in every respect - the rooms are sumptuous bed extremely comfortable toiletries excellent and the shower was perfect - there is also a large bath in the bathroom plus his and her wash hand basins. The rooms are kept in perfect condition and the whole hotel is amazingly clean never a spec of dust to be seen.    The choice of food is unbelievable - you just can not imagine the huge variety and everything displayed so attractively. At breakfast time you can have a choice of omelettes or pancakes plus every kind of salad items fruit cooked vegetables etc etc etc .. the selection of various breads and rolls is awesome! There are three kinds of freshly squeezed juices each day and replenished as soon as they are getting empty - tea of coffee is also available. If you have room for lunch well again there is a massive choice and again in the evening. The wines are local and excellent and a good choice of drinks in the bar as well where they also make coffee.    Near the bar is a grand piano and each evening you are entertained by two gentlemen on the keyboard and guitar and a lady singer there is also a Fred Astaire double some evenings who could put anyone of the guys on Strictly come Dancing to shame - he is amazing!!!!!    The garden areas are beautifully kept and plenty of places to sit and relax either in the sun or the shade - two lovely pools that are never over crowded.    All the staff are really good but special mention must be made by us of the following :-    Rashid - one of the Chef's who was so so pleasant to talk to and explained each and every dish to us in perfect English.    Nadia - a delightful waitress - always smiling and totally professional at all times. Again excellent English.    Rabab - what a lovely young lady who is training in the Bar area - a perfect smile at all times and superb at what she is doing. An real asset to the Hotel.    Last but not least - Sharif - the Concierge - you want to know something - then just ask him - again perfect English and extremely helpful at all times. He arranged a great half day trip for us to the Atlas Mountains with an excellent driver and again very knowledgeable about the whole area.

When we checked in receptionist was unable to find a room for us as there was a flight cancellation which led to many people overstaying. I was somewhat annoyed as I didn't want to have to goto another hotel and then come back. However the promises of the manager Badr were too good to turn down.    We ended up at the sister hotel the Kenzi Club which is more aimed for families or people who want to have fun. We were given one of the best rooms with a pool just outside for those in our block.    In the morning we had a lovely breakfast at the bar and had a small game of mini golf. We headed back to the Menara Palace to be given a full upgrade to a pool facing full suite (I get an upgrade regardless for my hotels but this was above and beyond) full boarding (breakfast lunch and dinner) and massage/spa for all 3 of us!    Kenzi Menara Palace is a 5 star luxury hotel which is more for those who want to relax and enjoy their stay there. The food is great and they have different themes each day They have live band in the bar and it is very relaxing. The staff are simply brilliant the customer relationship manager was very lovely and helpful and she even rang us in the room to see how we were.    The spa is amazing and the massage was class although a bit timid (being a tall large chap!) nevertheless excellent. The Jacuzzi is heavenly with oils and rose petals (30 mins) and you feel wonderfully refreshed. I suffer from a back problem and I was perfectly fine for the rest of the days.    Throughout our time there we were treated superbly (all these adjectives!) and even the front door staff were very friendly.    The only downside is there is no AC in the rooms. They have the hot/cold ventilation which isn't great but you can get by.    Overall an impressive hotel which will do their best to set things right but also give the best possible service regardless.    It is very easy to get to from the airport there are many amenities around it as on the street behind is a small mall with food outlets and a cinema There is a water park nearby which we didn't goto as it only has a few decent rides. The same road also leads to Ourika Waterfalls and the drive there is exhilarating.,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Cheshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/isadiq
Kenzi Menara Palace,Sharon T wrote a review Mar 2018,50,Fantastic long weekend,Celebrating a milestone birthday in our friendship group we headed off. The hotel is 10 mins from the airport which we were grateful for after our long delayed flight. When we pulled up we were not disappointed. Beautiful building with friendly and accommodating staff.  We had chosen the all-inclusive option which was very good. The food in the buffet restaurant was fantastic!  The drinks menu could have had a few more options for cocktails. The wine is good and the service was extremely good.  The pools were quiet but I think this was purely the time of year we went.  The spa is fantastic and would totally recommend it.  The only downside was no entertainment in the evening however you are not far from clubs if that is your thing so may get a little bored if staying a week.

Kenzi Menara Palace,David O wrote a review Mar 2018,50,"Beautiful Resort, Impeccable Service in Marrakech",My wife and I ventured for the first time to Morocco this past winter. After 20 hours of travel from Chicago through Madrid into Marrakesh our first destination was Kenzi Menara Palace - and no place did we feel more at home along our 2 weeks of travel in Africa. Situated a comfortable 10 minute drive from the airport and a 5 minute taxi to the medina the resort is host to an impressive tropical and botanical garden citrus grove an immaculate aquamarine pool and among the more exquisite southern views of the snow-capped Atlas Mountains. The resort itself is as much a palace as a hotel - marble floors grand ceilings impressive works of art intimate Italian and Moroccan restaurants employing some of the best chefs in Morocco and suites which offer the feel of traditional riad-style living. The 4-room suite we booked was gorgeous complete with a living room and lounging area a beautiful bedroom 2 bathrooms and a balcony overlooking the gardens. But above all the differentiator was the service received by prior by communications manager Rita local manager Aziz and his staff in Marrakech. At minimum I witnessed staff speak 4 different languages to various guests - English Spanish French and Arabic. They were both friendly and helpful. I strongly recommend to both couples and families - visit Kenzi Hotels while on your travels in Morocco. We certainly look forward to seeing our friends at Kenzi Menara Palace again while also staying some of Kenzi's other hotels in Casablanca Ouarzazate and Tangier during future travels.,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,United States,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LivefireRepublic

Kenzi Menara Palace,Jack S wrote a review Feb 2018,40,nice family friendly hotel,We spent a week at the kenzi menara and had a pleasant time albeit the weather wasn’t the best but that doesn’t take away from the hotel experience.    Pro:  The food in the main buffet is very nice and the general presentation is clean and tidy. There’s a good variety and you also get the authentic Moroccan tagines every day for dinner and lunch.  The spa facility is nice as there is also a heated pool indoors however this will cost 10 euros per person. The massages were nice and a tip is to ask if they have any two for one promotions for the week.  There are two outdoor pools a large one which no one used due to the weather and a smaller heated pool which they said was 22 degrees but again nobody was brave enough to use it.  Outside there is a pool bar and they will serve pizzas hamburgers and sandwiches from 1 to 4pm.  The Moroccan mint tea is nice and refreshing.  The guys in the entertainment team are very friendly.  They had a lot of patience to accommodate my child during meal times.  Taxi to the airport should cost around 15 euros and is only 15 – 20 mins away.    Cons:  There is a lot of attempt to charge extra wherever they can for example the Moroccan restaurant offers little more than what you can have in the al a carte however this will cost 20 euros more just for a different seating.  The hotel atmosphere seems quite but maybe this was the off season.  The rooms are nice but the shower facilities were not very appealing and the water is cold for quite a long time.  There is certainly a priority given to locals and French speaking guests over others and this can be seen as quite rude and disrespectful.    Overall I would certainly recommend this hotel during the months of march to October where you can make full use of the facilities and pools. It is a family friendly environment and in close proximity to many tourist attractions such as the YSL museum and gardens. Hope this helps!,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/107JackS

However my experience was really very good when considering the price point of the property. I stayed at the Kenzi for 14 days and was very happy. The rooms a clean and well furnished bathrooms are fresh and spacious beds comfortable there are even UK TV channels available. Gardens and surroundings are very pleasant. Food available is extensive but not of the highest quality but again for what you are paying then the food is fine - hot tasty and plentiful. Beer and wine are local and exactly what you would expect. Cocktails are very strong with generous measures. My primary arbiter is the staff and these where excellent friendly and helpful.

Kenzi Menara Palace,maylen20 wrote a review Jan 2018,40,Good price quality hotel,People: most of the hotel staff are friendly. You do notice some who struggle a bit but no worrying situations...    Food: great good and plenty of choice! The tajins were delicious and the dessert buffet was at an unseen level. Apparently the chef won multiple prices. Maybe best to heat the plates as some dishes were not that hot ;)    The breakfast service can be improved though. Food remains good but we were a bit left on our own on some occasions. But once again not a big issue.    Room: very tidy! It was difficult to heat the room. The airco system is placed under the ceiling and we had the impression the room was not heated enough. The rest was ok ;)    Taxi: would be good if the hotel uses fix drivers and indicates what the maximum price is within the medina and from the outside to the city etc. This to give some indication to the ignorent tourists. Especially the first days this could come handy :)    We enjoyed the services of Barbara who guided us a bit and gave us a good tip to go and eat when you want to escape the buffets. Try 'Chouet' restaurant! A very nice French kitchen in a beautiful setting. Only 5 min away by taxi!!    So we really enjoyed this hotel. The price quality is really good. Hence we can see through some minor things. Worth visiting for sure. For us the timing was perfect! The peace and quiet were perfect. High season crowd might change the experience low season stay certainly has advantages!

Kenzi Menara Palace,Bellbag62 wrote a review Jan 2018,40,A Fabulous Christmas Break,We had a fabulos break at the Kenzi Menara over Christmas.  We were on an all inclusive break organised by Your Golf Travel  We were a bit sceptical as to how it would be organised but all the taxi transfers were on time for our 3 day’s of golf.  On Christmas Eve there was a gala dinner which was amazing.  Hot and cold dishes of every description the patisserie was stunning with ‘French’ flair.  On the last night the evening meal had a Moroccan theme. We had the opportunity to sample many traditional Moroccan dishes and sweat meats. A Moroccan band moved between the tables and entertained us.  Wine was available with all meals and although Moroccan it was quite acceptable.  Our room was huge and very clean. The shower was rather slow and the bath took forever to fill!  The staff were friendly and helpful.  My only complaint was that although activities were available they were not well advertised.  We hope to return again next Christmas.,Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"West Mersea, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bellbag62
Kenzi Menara Palace,Jon W wrote a review Jan 2018,10,A highly disappointing experience. Hotel to avoid at any costs!!!,First and foremost lack of clarity on the website (mobile version does not work properly...) at booking made us wrongly book for 1 adult. While it could have been easily managed at reception management forced us to take an all inclusive package (difficult to argue or find another hotel on NYE...). Management showed a lot of arrogance shaky argument and lot of familiarity...  Overall quality of services is rather bad. As we have been forced to take the all inclusive package we tried it for lunch and food was a disaster... Lunch is supposed to be served till 3pm but everything was cold at 2.30pm (with employees eating next to you in spite of taking care of the food for customers...). In general employees were rather familiar struggling to speak decent French and in general poor English...  Top management was clearly prioritising locals (step up the queue for tables best seats reserved etc.).  Infrastructure is getting old (see picture). Some parts are falling apart.  Probably my worst hotel experience ever.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Beth M wrote a review Dec 2017,40,Wonderful Week Away,We just got back from a lovely holiday spent at the Kenzi Menara Palace. Being out of season the hotel was quiet and whilst some small touch ups to the hotel were being made this didn’t affect us in the slightest.    The hospitality was wonderful with at least 3 members of staff checking in with us each day to see if they could help us or improve our stay. Shout out to Sherif who never failed to put a smile on our faces!    The language barrier was sometimes an issue with staff having varying levels of English (would recommend a French phrase book!)    We booked two excursions through tui and two through the hotel. I’d recommend doing the camels through the hotel as it’s the same tour but cheaper. I’d also recommend doing the quad biking through tui (or your travel company) as this was in the Atlas Mountains and much better than the one offered through the hotel.    The food was delicious. Plenty of choice and varying buffet themes for dinner. Lunch by the pool and the bbq by the hotel we’re both amazing. Snacks are available but usually sweet. Breakfast was a Moroccan experience but we never went hungry! - we were usually still too full from dinner.    All in all we had a wonderful stay and were very sad to leave!

Kenzi Menara Palace,UtterlyDelightful wrote a review Dec 2017,30,Definitely not 5*,Good sized rooms and lovely swimming pools but other than that Kenzi Menara hotel is pretty basic.    The buffet breakfast is OK but they need to be more attentive to cleanliness and hygiene. The breakfast room (even when the doors are closed) is filled with sparrow birds that have managed to get in and eat guests food when they get up for re-fills and we even saw a couple of birds pooing on the tables - gross!! There was also ants & insects in the pastries which made me think they were definitely not fresh and had probably been recycled from the day before.    The bedrooms again are OK. They're a good size but lots of things were broken or needed replacing in the rooms. E.g. fans in the room made a lot of banging noise when switched on and despite mentioning it to staff nothing was done about it. The shower door was also broken.    The hotel has far too many restrictions on what you can / cannot do. The Italian restaurant was shut one of the nights we were staying and the only food they could give us was buffet style. Not even room service food.    We comeback to our room 3 times to find that the key card was broken and had to walk to reception (which is far by the way) to get it fixed. To explanation was given to why it had broken.    We also came back to our room twice to find that the room had been made up but our towels had been taken away with again no explanation - very strange.,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UtterlyDelightful

The first evening we girls decided to enjoy drinks by the pool lovely landscape of gardens and private areas to sit and enjoy your company. The waiting staff named Anass would always make sure we’re comfortable and enjoying our drinks. As the evening drew to the end we headed towards the dining area which had a great selection. Oh I forgot to mention I went with a group of three girls and the room was so spacious with a very big bathroom separate shower and bath with two sinks. We were lucky to be close to the dining and the pool. The next day we were greeted by Soukaina who looked after guests at the hotel. Absolutely lovely lady who made our entire trip worthwhile. Staff by the pool were so great Fatima lovely bubbly lady. Said who made sure you had a drink and Abdu who entertained you with great music and also played tracks you requested. Amine and Sabrine were the hotel guest entertainers so you could have sessions of pool aerobics to belly dancing by the pool. We had a lot to see in Marrakech so we inquired at concierge what is there to see in Marrakech we were offered a couple of options by Sherif who I have to say is very thorough and after being on the tours of three separate days all were as we would have wanted. Gardens and palaces were beautiful the Atlas Mountains and camel ride in the dessert. We stayed there for eight days and everyday was better than the other.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Chalfont2017 wrote a review Nov 2017,40,Family holiday October,Big comfortable rooms. As a family of four we went for two connecting rooms overlooking the pool which was perfect for us. There are two outdoor pools - one large unheated one which was great for exercise and cooling off and one small heated which our youngest child loved. There is a bar beside the pool which offers some food as well as drinks and serves pastries in the afternoon.    We were fully inclusive. Food was OK. The hotel seemed to specialise in desserts with a big array of cakes which were all very tasty. Free drinks range included beer wine and some cocktails. Restaurant staff were friendly although sometimes had to be asked for things such as coffee a couple of times before they arrived. Although fully inclusive there are local taxes that have to be paid at the end of the stay.    Front of house staff were also friendly and helpful.    Hotel is located outside of the city centre - about 10 minutes by taxi (50 to 100 dirham depending on the time of day) or courtesy bus from the hotel (timetable is at the concierge's desk). The location is lovely and quiet. It suited us to be away from the madness and noise of the city centre but some may feel they are not getting the full experience.    We went at the end of October and the weather was perfect - 30 degrees and sunny every day. great for some last minute sun.    We are hoping to go again.    There did seem to be a lot of development going on around the city so we are hoping it will still be the same when we get back there.    I have classed the hotel as luxury based on facilities and price.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Amersham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chalfont2017

Kenzi Menara Palace,Perthman2121 wrote a review Nov 2017,30,Understaffed hotel,The hotel had good rooms. However there was usually only one person serving in the dinning room and so often left with dirty plates. Getting a drink at the bar was like fighting a battle. The Italian restaurant (for which we paid a premium) had the most disgusting food imaginable - and dreadful service. The other diners said the same. We were on an all-inclusive holiday but this limited choice of drinks etc totally. When we arrived I asked for a sandwich but was told 'you have to wait until afternoon tea' - which was tea and a few cakes.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Tim C wrote a review Nov 2017,20,The Emperor's new clothes,I'll concede outwardly this is a 5 star resort. The rooms are large the hotel clean and the pool big. What lets down this place is the staff. For example; on arrival at our room booked for 2 adults and 1 child there was no extra bed. To sort this issue out took 5 phone calls to 3 different people over 2 ½ hours. OK any hotel or restaurant can have issues so that alone is not worthy of a bad review but the Kenzi just kept delivering. Day 2 our room was half served in that despite us being out of the room (with the 'make up the room' tag on) from 9am till 4pm almost nothing was done. 'Almost' as they did take all the towels away and...well that was it. To get towels took increasingly irate calls to disinterested staff. 1 ½ hours to get 3 towels. The lady running the breakfast area was openly hostile especially when we dared (and politely) asked for a large milk spill (not by us) to be cleaned as it was in a high traffic area. 45 mins for that to happen. Apparently not her job. She even walked through it on her way to disappoint other guests.    To sum its up these are I acknowledge real first world problems but when a Hotel hangs up the 5 ***** sign they really should try and deliver. The only way this place could call itself 5 star is if it was out of 10.,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Uzes, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C3678GLtimc

The resort is perfect for those traveling as a couple families solo and business travelers. The resort is set up in such a way that everyone can enjoy their stay. The grounds and pool was one of the best that we experienced in Morocco. The buffet lunch was set up to accommodate everyone those looking for authentic Moroccan food had great choices and those looking for basic salads sandwiches had the same.

Kenzi Menara Palace,sjbxxx wrote a review Oct 2017,30,All about the money,First trip to Morocco and first impression in the hotel and everywhere we went is everything is about tipping ! Nobody is nice to you without expecting money.  As for the hotel definitely not 5 star and we didn't take the all-inclusive option and very very much like 2nd class citizens and that the staff couldn't be bothered with regular paying customers like it was too much effort. Also found that the drinks we were paying extremely high prices for were the same as the all-inclusive guests same as the food in the pool bar. Talking about the pool bar our biggest critisism of the hotel miserable staff tables never laid or cleared so ended up getting napkins cutlery mats etc ourselves and worst thing of all WARM BEER in warm glasses !!!! We complained to one member of staff about this and he glared at us as if we were mad and begrudgingly took the bottles away and said he would put them in ice !!!!! Hence we had to sit there gasping for 15 mins for them to get relatively cool. Terrible service for a supposedly 5 star hotel.  The actual pools and the pool staff though were fabulous.  Rooms were lovely and large with nice big towels and robes.  Luckily we had great weather because if we hadn't I don't know what we'd have done there is nothing close by without organising trips or taxis. Plus the evening entertainment in the hotel was zilch apart from a pianist + singer a couple of nights.  Breakfast was ok but again and I am sorry to keep repeating myself not fit for a 5 star hotel just average.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Deucebigalo wrote a review Oct 2017,40,Certainly worth a visit.,This was our first time in Morocco and certainly won't be our last although we might go coastal next time. The hotel is 'nice'. Its large and stylish but there's a lot of little touches missing. Things that just make it a 5*. Teaspoons for one (distinct lack of them) service food variety room fittings etc.. The hotel and its owners have a perfectly reasonable 4* place and seem happy with that. There's no discernible desire to be anything more. And that's fine. Its a shame because the hotel has the potential to push on to the next level (we had loads of ideas for this). My last 2 holidays were both 5* (to Egypt and Cape Verde) so I noticed the small things. Our room was large and somewhat comfortable with plenty of space to not be in each others way. I had a couple of issues with it upon arrival 1 being the plug socket not fixed to its bracket correctly (dangerous) which was fixed first day and the other being the water flooding out the bottom of the shower door every time you had a shower which was overlooked despite me asking for it to be sorted.  The pool area was great. Probably the hotels best feature. Spacious with 2 pools and never once did I have a problem getting a bed despite not getting to the pool area till 3pm 1 day. The poolside bar is okay but the barman never looked interested never smiled or interacted with the customers be they French or English speaking. I know most of us don't like our jobs but we try to smile and be friendly if its in our remit. They serve a limited selection during the day (chips pizza burger is about the lot) and cakes everyday at 5. But its the same cakes EVERY day.  The restaurant is nice and comfortable but again the food lets it down. Its very samey with very little imagination into changing it up. They did move the cooking outside a couple of times which was an interesting twist but the food didn't change much. A little tip for breakfast. They serve fresh pancakes (called 'm'semen' - insert joke) outside on a black cart but nobody tells you this and there's no signage. We missed it the first 2 days.  Reception are helpful - to a point. They'll do their job but won't go above or beyond. Example - there's tea and coffee in the room but no milk. So I asked at reception to be told there would be a charge for this. Unless I wait till midnight when I could order room service for free (which took over an hour first night I used it). At this point I must give praise to Sherif. What an absolute credit to the hotel. We flew with first choice but never saw the rep once during our stay (despite repeated emails to head office - he never even tipped up to the welcome meeting). But Sherif was there to offer advice on going out arrange hotel transport a trip out with own driver and even managed to get us a late checkout on the room (for which reception wanted to charge when we asked them). And his English is excellent. Top bloke.  Location wise its just on the outskirts of the busier side of things but there's a nice shopping complex about 10 mins walk away with all you need. And felt perfectly safe doing so.  Overall its a good hotel but not a great hotel (although it could be). Some of the serving staff were excellent (Mohammed for 1) but only some. There's not enough going the extra mile (bar a couple).,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Telford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deucebigalo
Kenzi Menara Palace,tmc25015 wrote a review Oct 2017,40,"Our 2nd visit, great hotel",This was our 2nd visit and there were some noticeable improvements compared to last year. We emailed ahead to let the hotel know we were coming back for our 2nd Wedding Anniversary and we could not have wished for a better welcome or service throughout our stay. Soukhaina Guest Relations was extremely helpful making all the arrangements welcoming us on our arrival and was committed throughout our stay to ensuring our break was enjoyable.    The Reception staff were friendly & efficient checking us in & out quickly and all our requests were dealt with quickly.    Our room was fabulous cleaned well everyday with lovely romantic towel art most days. The towels and bed linen were fresh & clean and very good quality. The room was very comfortable and spacious with two outside balconies.    The hotel grounds are very well maintained as is the pool and restaurant areas. The lunchtime food is very nice at the pool bar although it's quite a small menu but there is the buffet option too. We only went to the buffet in the evening where there is a big choice something for everyone but as we like to eat late some of the dishes were looking a little tired by the time we arrived; however they do serve until 11pm so its understandable.    We were a little disappointed this year with the Italian restaurant the food quality was not quite as good and the restaurant was very hot so made it difficult to enjoy the food but the Moroccan was much improved where we had a very enjoyable evening and great efficient & friendly service from Mohamed. Be prepared to pay a surcharge at both restaurants but it is clearly stated on the Welcome Letter though    I cannot fault the staff from the time we arrived to the minute we left all were very friendly and helpful. We would like to extend our special thanks in particular to Mohamed Monsef Ali Aissam & Nouredinne for looking after so very well during dinner we had some fun evenings with great memories.    We would recommend this hotel; the hotel is generous very well maintained and the staff friendly & welcoming.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Rikki G wrote a review Oct 2017,30,Standards have slipped,This is the second time we have stayed here. The last time was about 5 years. Since then it would seem that the numbers of staff have reduced and there is no cohesive approach to ensuring a great stay. When asked for something such as towels we were often told it was not their department. There was a tendency of cleaning the room and taking all the towels and not replacing them until late afternoon.    The postivies are the big rooms. Lovely pool. Some very good staff such as Sherif (who was there previously as is still as helpful as ever) Mohissein(I have probably spelt that wrong) in the restaurant and Amine who is in charge of entertainment and the kids club.    The Italian and Moroccan restaurants were excellent. We had a birthday and went to the Moroccan restaurant and all the staff we very nice and helpful. The bonus was the local music that was being played.    For us this time the food in the main restaurant was not as good as before. The staff could not help if it was a question outside their job description and just shrugged their shoulders. The food was not to a high standard and we got ill towards the end of the stay. The drinks are not premium and the local beer and wines take some getting used to. The themed nights seemed to be much better in terms of standard of the food. We were on the all inclusive package.    The rooms while being large now needs some refurbishment. There were a number of faults with the doors lights not working room keys routinely not working. The showers were poor quality. Within our group we had someone who was disabled and there did not seem to much help or support. We are also placed in the furthest room from reception. We did raise this with several staff members who did say they would help with this but is was slow and not effective.    The last few days were better but it may have been that we just more accepting of the circumstances.    Overall we did have a good time especially our 3 year old son but we would think again about returning which is a real pity as we really enjoyed our time previously. The hotel needs to be updated and needs more staff in order to provide a real 5 star service.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/42rikkig

Very very helpful and makes your stay a pleasant one because he will do the extra mile for you.    Breakfast- not much choice but it's ok.  Could have some more friendly staff working at breakfast time.    Shuttle bus- use it it takes you straight to the square (town) and everything is at or near the square. Save a lot of taxi rides.

Kenzi Menara Palace,5cruffy wrote a review Oct 2017,30,"Facilities great, service so-so",Starting with the positives - the rooms facilities and grounds are excellent. Everything was clean (apart from one cockroach in the bathroom) the pools is huge and there was always plenty of space on loungers. The rooms are large (we had a garden view room) with good wifi and the grounds are well looked after. The cheerful aqua aerobics guy at the pool worked very hard the lead concierge was helpful and the singer in the evening had a beautiful voice. Food in the restaurants was good all around - we had all inclusive but it would appear expensive if you don't.    However the whole experience gets let down by what I guess is a lack of staff training or staff retention. No one seemed to know what was going on - you got different answers every time you asked. One of the younger concierges was rude the lady behind the bar was surly and shouted a lot and the waiters had to be asked three or four times until bringing coffee/drinks. I contracted food poisoning and felt too hot to lie by the pool for the last two days but it took a lot of discussion before they would extend our checkout time to cater for my illness - it could all have been handled quicker and with more consideration. The two times we took the shuttle bus into the Medina it was 15 minutes late departing because the driver was off on other errands (short staffed?). It took two days to replace a light bulb in the bathroom.    We enjoyed the stay overall but it could have been so much better with a little more work on the staff attitudes and communication.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Swindon, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5cruffy
Kenzi Menara Palace,Mark H wrote a review Oct 2017,50,Two weeks of relaxation,We wanted two weeks of relaxation some where warm and sunny in late late September to early October. We stayed here from September 22nd until October 6th.  The hotel was clean and welcoming and the staff were all friendly and helpful.  Hassan Yassine at the main bar is a real asset to the hotel fantastic service and always mixes a perfect drink whatever it may be.  The concierge Sheriff was always a great help. On our return he phoned our holiday rep because the transfer to the airport was late and sorted it out. We did not get a chance to thank him which was a shame.  Barbera and the staff at the pool bar always gave great service and were very friendly and welcoming.  All the staff were great.  Sometimes they could do with more waiters for breakfast and in the evening but this was only a minor point in an otherwise fantastic holiday. We hope to return next year.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Faye C wrote a review Oct 2017,50,Wow...!,I have just returned from a week's stay at Kenzi Menara with my partner and can honestly say we had the best holiday! We were given a gorgeous one bedroom suite which was huge with views over the gardens. We had fresh linen everyday which was lovely although unnecessary (think of the planet!) nothing at the hotel was too much trouble the staff were exceptionally attentive a big shout out to Sherif on concierge who went over and above to ensure we had a great time. Lots of space and beds by the 2 pools and we had no issues with getting sun beds although there were lots of empty sun beds with towels on early. Food was good although not exceptional lots of choice though so can't complain! We went all inclusive which I would definitely recommend as it would be very expensive otherwise. Marrakech clearly relies heavily on tourism and they are working very hard here to ensure people have a lovely time and it shows! Would highly recommend.,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Maidstone, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/826fayec
Kenzi Menara Palace,wajihassan wrote a review Oct 2017,20,golfing trip for a group of 8,We stayed at Kenzi Menara hotel from 30/09 /17 to 06/101/17 as part of an all inclusive golf package. I have stayed here before and every year the standard is getting lower.    1. Please don't expect a 5 star service at the reception desk or at the bar. People are rude and generally will ignore your request for drinks especially if you are not collecting them yourself at the counter.    2. Breakfast and dinner service by waiters is non existent. Every morning we had to ask 2-3 times for our coffee which was generally served cold.    3. The breakfast and dinner menu has not changed in the last few years. You have very limited choices.We had all inclusive package but ate only once at the Hotel.    4. We did complain about the lack of service to an evening manager who said it happens at hotels in Europe too!    There are some very friendly people at concierge and porters are also very friendly.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Leicestershire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wajihassan
Kenzi Menara Palace,djboss wrote a review Oct 2017,30,"Definately not a 5• ""Haven of Peace""","There should be lots of great things to say about this hotel but they are overshadowed by its totally inaccurate description as a ""Haven of Peace"". Every day was a battle to have the loud badly mixed eurotrash music turned down. Echoing around the pool area and at times audible in the closed bedroom from the pool pa.  Reaction from the management was that some clients asked for music by the pool. Their response should have been to send them elsewhere leaving those of us that booked a ""Haven of Peace"" to enjoy a ""Haven of Peace""  The decor in the room was certainly not up to 5* standards (pics attached) with shoddy bathroom fittings and poor air con.  Apart from the amazing desserts the food in the self serve canteen was at best ok but a million miles from even 4*. Not bad but not that good either.  After complaint to Sentido group I was promised a response direct from the hotel this never materialised and they themselves have gone silent. I thoroughly expect the same banal ineffective response from the hotel as everyone law has received. Ineffective and patronising. Hopefully some tour operators will back away from this place to wake them up from the complacent attitude and prompt them into making this the hotel it deserves to be at which point I may return.",Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/djboss
Kenzi Menara Palace,shodaw wrote a review Oct 2017,20,Not the best 2 weeks,I traveled to Morocco for 4 weeks and as part of my stay spent 2 weeks here. Really not good. The rooms are lovely but the hotel and staff were poor at best. Having read the other reviews I was looking forward to my stay but was massively disappointed. Firstly the hotel has no atm so at 10pm you were directed a 20 min walk down alleys to one. The bill for meals would arrive straight after the starter and the staff seemed annoyed when told I still wanted coffee after my meal. Room service took on average 30mins to answer the phone the the food was cold when it arrived. The roaches in reception didn’t help confidence. I’m sure to avoid this as the other members of my team stayed elsewhere and had a much better experience.,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Bracknell, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shodaw

Massive rooms great local healthy food (if you ignore the pancakes dough & superb desert buffet & pastries. Again maybe we were lucky - there was a medical conference for 3 days & no noise at night though we did shut the doors as it was so very warm.    Can't fault the service - sometimes a little slow but hey you're on holiday. Try to speak a few words of French you Brits & relax. Sometimes a shortage of cutlery but bottled wine & water freely available. Animation team good - a couple of times a day it was too loud but speak to the guy on the PA. He usually only ramps it up if someone or some group wants him to. We didn't dine in either of the speciality restaurants this time as it was so lovely to eat outside on the terrace.    No faults & we have already booked to go in March.

It didn't disappoint very clean huge rooms and beds.We stayed on all inclusive which I would recommend. All of the staff worked very hard to please you and make your stay perfect.  Our favourite waiter was Mohamed Bellouch who always greeted us with a warm smile and made us feel very special from day one.  You will not go hungry the food is very good and varied every day there is always something that you will fancy from traditional moroccan tagines to freshly cooked pizza.  The location couldn't be better with a view of the Atlas Mountains in the distance and a 10 minute shuttle bus (free supplied by the hotel) in to the centre of Marrakech.  The swimming pools are perfect for cooling down after you have spent some time on the very comfortable sun beds which is all kept very clean. We had no problems getting a perfect spot along as you are at the pool by 11 o'clock.

Kenzi Menara Palace,... wrote a review Sep 2017,30,Visit in september,We just came back from a week at this hotel.  The hotel is stunning the room are huge and everything in the hotel just beautiful from the pool to the reception area.  Cleaning ladies and restaurants/bars staff are very friendly and always smiling to you!  The guy in charge of entertainment Amine is just amazing he can do anything from aquagym to waterpolo to dj to singer to musician and for us he is the star of the hotel!  The buffet is not very big and gets a bit boring after 1 week at the hotel. We went to the moroccan restaurant that I would not recommend at allthe couscous was actually better at the buffet. My friend got very ill after eating there.  There is plenty of sunbeds by the pool but they get booked very quickly my advice would be to not leave your sunbed with only your towel on it or you will come back and have lost your sunbed. This happened to us while going for lunch but the staff helped us getting two more sunbeds.  The evenings can be a bit boring there isn't much to do. The only entertainment was a lady singing pretty much every nights.  The drinks menu for all inclusive is very small and there is no sparkling wine included or branded alcohol. This was a first for us in a five star hotel.  Overall the hotel is good but I don't think we will come back.,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Miriam0488
Kenzi Menara Palace,chrisO6035FL wrote a review Sep 2017,20,Beautiful hotel sadly let down by the food & service.,A short trip from the airport to a quiet part of Marrakech brings you to the Kenzi Menara Palace. First impressions of the hotel were very good. The hotel sits in its own immaculately maintained gardens the interior lobby area is impressive and the bedroom a good size with air con and a well stocked mini fridge. We were on the ground floor so had a small patio upper floors had balconies. We arrived in the middle of the night due to a delayed flight however was given a warm welcome at reception and escorted to our room. We were informed room service was available if we require any refreshments FOC until 6am.  Breakfast lunch & dinner are all served in the buffet restaurant which left a lot to be desired (the food was poor quality & didn't vary throughout our stay). The service was appalling for a 5* hotel there were a couple of waiters that made an effort but the majority were not interested if you were not French! Instead of waiting for the staff to find you a vacant table the norm was to find your own “dirty” table then attempt to find a waiter that could clear away the used tableware and bring you clean utensils. It was so bad we actually went to the local Burger King on several occasions not surprisingly other guests did the same. The Italian restaurant were good but you had to book in advance and the menu was limited unless you wanted to pay extra.  The main pool is large unfortunately it’s not possible to swim in it as majority of the guests tend to paddle about to cool down. There were not enough of sunloungers every morning there was a mad dash to reserve them (Even though there’s a sign stating no reservations). The pool 'entertainment' was unacceptably loud Music was piped out all day as standard and several times a day a DJ ramped up the volume so much we had to leave the pool area.  The “all-inclusive package” was so limited in terms of drink options basic beer & wine no cocktails or recognised spirits. Not what we are used to.  If the hotel could sort out the food/service and the pool entertainment then this could really be a good hotel worthy of its 5* rating.,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Milnsbridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisO6035FL
Kenzi Menara Palace,Rebekah M wrote a review Sep 2017,30,Ok but not great,We have just returned from 6 nights here. Although the hotel is nicely decorated and well laid out I wouldn't say it was 5 star.  Checking in was easy and we was shown straight to our room even though we arrived several hours before check in. We booked a double room but was given a twin which wasn't great as we had to push our beds together each night.  Having said that the room was a really good size with lovely bathroom. Our shower wasn't working properly to start with but after asking twice it was fixed. The aircon also broke but was fixed when we reported it.  The housekeeping was a bit odd they came in the morning to collect towels and then replaced them later in the day which meant that if we had wanted to shower in between we would have had no towels. Also the mini bar was refilled randomly fanta replaced with beer sprite replaced with coke... and no milk for tea or coffee.  Our room was a ground floor room overlooking the pool which was a fab location and we enjoyed sitting on the terrace.  The pool area is great. The pool is really big and there is plenty of seating and umbrellas. The pool bar is also very good serving lovely cocktails and drinks as well as a late lunch.  The main buffet restaurant was ok although the food wasn't fantastic and wasn't labelled well which meant it was difficult to work out what we was eating. Not ideal if you have allergies or intolerances. The service in the restaurant was pretty poor we often had to wait for drinks and ask for spoons etc. There didn't seem to be enough staff for the size of the restaurant and amount of people. The best thing about the restaurant was the desserts which were lovely although they didn't change much during the week.  We tried the Moroccan restaurant one evening which has put us both off Moroccan food for life I think. There was only two things to choose from for all 3 courses and the English descriptions were not accurate so we was both confused and disappointed with what was served. I had to send my main back as the menu said lamb but I received chicken - the waitress tried to convince me that I was wrong even though it was on the menu in black and white. I was also ill the day after eating in the Moroccan restaurant.  The main bar was also nice a good atmosphere and lots of seating.  We also used the spa which was pretty good.  It was fine for a few days in the sun by the pool relaxing.,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"King's Lynn, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/516rebekahm

Kenzi Menara Palace,L B wrote a review Sep 2017,30,Lovely hotel but questionable hygiene,The hotel is every bit as beautiful as the pictures. The checkin is easy rooms are comfortable and large and there is a great amount of activities you can do at the hotel.    There were a few issues which Im highlighting during our stay.    Hygiene: during our stay the pool turned green for 2 days with no explanation from the staff. We googled and found that it was due to lack of chlorine in the pool. After speaking with the staff about the quality of the water they admitted the filter had broken as was being fixed on the day. In addition to this a child vomited in the pool. I raised this with the bar staff by the pool but they did not evacuate the pool or clean it.    Another hygiene issue is that birds often enter the dining room during breakfast. They cover most of the empty tables and there is clearly bird poo on the lamps.    Service:  It was noticeable from the checkin that the hotel staff would interact mainly with my male partner. This included handling bills addressing to and listening to complaints. We didn't experience this at all in Marrakech.    The only other downer is the service at breakfast. It's nearly impossible to get a coffee or tea. The staff are extremely slow in cleaning the tables.    Despite some questionable hygiene standards; we enjoyed our stay. I would recommend taking advantage of this as an all inclusive- it's difficult to find lunch around the area.,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LizzieB91

Very lovely hotel - grounds were clean and pool and loungers were great. Rooms were big and comfortable (although beds are quite hard).    Food let this hotel down. I actually dreaded going to dinner by the end of the week because I had the same thing every day for a week and I am not fussy! I am currently 7 months pregnant and would eat ANYTHING!!!    I ate in the Italian restaurant thinking it might change things up a bit it did not. The food is pretty much the same and the atmosphere in there was awkward - you can hear a pin drop its so quiet. Some backing music is defiantly recommended.    Overall I would say this hotel is great for a long weekend but not 7 day holiday.

Kenzi Menara Palace,mohammed a wrote a review Sep 2017,40,Family visit in August,The hotel at first sight is amazing. The foyer is very clean and spacious. The room is very large for an average family room which included two large sized balconies.  The bathroom is clean and spacious with a good regular top up of toiletries and towels.  Negatives  The breakfast compared to other hotels we have stayed in around north Africa and Europe is very limited. It was disappointing overall but then you also had no access to regular beverages and had to ask for tea and coffee  which was normally manned by one waiter. This took a long time especially when the restaurant was busy.  Customer service on arrival was appalling. No welcome drink no offer of taking luggage no actual warm welcome from the lady at the desk. Dissatisfied with the service especially if you travel such a long way to relax and have a good time.  Towels were limited and the guys around the pool were sometimes very slow in moving the heavy parasols.  The loungers were reserved which is clearly stated as a big no but the staff don't challenge this  Tips  Definitely go the mall which is ten minutes away on foot. You have burger king and other food outlets as well as bowling and cinema.  Location is good. The shuttle service was great!! Drops you off in the bazar near the mosque!!  Pool was great for kids! Our kids can be loud when excited but no disgruntled faces from staff. I know some other reviewers complained about loud kids but if you have a very shallow end it is intended for use by kids so the complaint makers should sunbathe around the open areas on the deeper side of the pool.    Overall there are some negatives but I have listed these for potential people who would like to visit and not be overwhelmed by them .

Kenzi Menara Palace,Happilyeverwilliams wrote a review Aug 2017,50,Ticked all the boxes,Expectations of a holiday are very personal. My wish list for this visit inc 5 star hotel all inclusive pool gardens low level buildings good price point and great staff. All these were met and more at this hotel.    So I'd like to give you a flavour of my holiday in case this helps you in your quest for your next vacation location.    As you approach the hotel it looks lovely. Great architecture and a good location for access to the old town. Once inside the smell is divine and the reception area is spacious and well furnished. We received a very warm welcome from many members of staff. The bedrooms are large with lots of storage (hooray). We had an upper floor garden/pool facing room. The grounds are beautiful and the hotel is laid out very well. There are 2 pools. A small shallow pool and a huge main pool with a small toddler section at one end. It was the height of the season but there was still room to swim - the pool is BIG. We always managed to get a sun bed. I am aware that other reviewers have commented on the lack of sun beds. I know the pool staff work very hard to ensure everyone can be accommodated. Like every great hotel during the summer holidays they are fully booked - which can present its own set of problems. This might mean you have a recliner cushion on the grass for a couple of hours but the staff will always try to find a sun bed for you.    The food was of a good quality. I'm not a fast food kinda gal but like tasty well prepared meals. If you want UK food abroad then you'll be disappointed. This was French/Morrocan with some Italian dishes thrown in (pasta and pizza was available as well as chips every day. Personally I loved the fresh fish leg of lamb tagines dauphinois potatoes Lyon potatoes sautéed mixed veg lentil salad beetroot salad poppy seed bread humous watermelon fresh OJ Morrocan pancakes and the odd French pastry (rude not to). During the afternoon burgers club sandwiches and a salad or two were also available from the pool bar (if you still had the munchies).    The white wine and beer (hubby's drinks not me) were very drinkable but I have to say that the hotel bar cocktails were wonderful. The Side Car was my particular favourite. I tried lots of new ones as well encouraged by the lovely bar staff who taught me to be more adventurous. The taste was always great as well as the beautiful presentation.    The staff were fantastic. Many go above and beyond so that you have the best time possible. I didn't see the manager during my stay but I had no need to as his/her staff took care of everything. Special mention to Soukaina Hasan Barbårä Laila Mehdi Doha Rochdi Ali Rabab Fatima Zahra Khaoula Molay Ahmed Mohamed (dining room) the smiling security guard the gardeners for the gorgeous topiary and house keeping as the hotel was spotless all the time.    So all my boxes were ticked. I had a fab holiday especially considering it was peak season.    This hotel offers exceptional value for money as well as high standards. I had a wonderful holiday. So make your own tick list do your research and hopefully you won't be disappointed.    This was my third time to Marrakech- each visit has been fantastic. I have stayed at three very different but fabulous hotels.

Some people will always find or try to find things wrong.. simply put they just love to moan.. ignore their reviews ... go and enjoy yourself at this hotel.. the staff will most certainly go the extra mile to take care of you... some would say that this is just their job but some staff go beyond that.. we were treated wonderfully and I would class some of the staff as new friends.    I'll start with Guest Relations and a lady named Soukaina.. what an amazing woman.. she made sure that everything was perfect for us from pre-arrival to leaving she left nothing to chance and we felt the most welcome that you could possibly feel. She's very warm and friendly smiles from her lovely eyes and simply put she took care of our every need without it ever feeling like a problem because it wasn't to her.... I am happy to call her a new friend and I thank her for making a wonderful holiday for us.    The staff and management around the pool work so hard and always with a lovely smile.. special mentions to Leila Doha and Mehdi.. super smiles even in 43 degree heat working tirelessly.. as does the manager here Barbara who just wants everything to be perfect and works very hard to attain that - and it is and always with a wonderful genuine smile. Thank you again.. your team works very hard and it's much appreciated.    Now the bar inside.. fantastic cocktails made by Hasan.. just a wonderful guy making the holiday feel that extra bit special.. we tried some wonderful cocktails and they were immaculately presented to us and always with a smile even after a full day's work.. thank you again. His team also work very hard and always with a wonderful smile.. special mentions to Khaoula & Fatima Zahra (who also work the restaurants too!)    Breakfast was great - the Moroccan pancakes with eggs bacon and honey were delicious.. we we're once again totally looked after by a lovely man - Rochdi who always had a smile and made sure we were fully taken care of even remembering what we liked to drink for breakfast and lunch. The lunch and dinner had variety and was very well cooked the pastries were amazing - I had to stop myself having too many because they were that good. Mohamed took care of us for dinner and once again always with a smile. Ali manages the restaurant and he always greeted us.. thank you all again.    Reception staff are always there to help with special mention to Molay Ahmed and Rabab.. again the genuine smiles chats and help are amazing - thank you again.    Other special mentions to Cherif for taking care of a special request and delivering something very special - many thanks again. Also Hamza - always smiling with his dapper moustache red shoes and cheekiness.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Lynn W wrote a review Aug 2017,30,Battle of the sunbeds! Bataille de transats!,The positives are a great size pool plenty of choice for food. The rooms are spacious but I would suggest a pool room view as the garden rooms are on the road. The hotel is situated just 10 minutes drive from the center of Marrakech a taxi should cost about 50 dirham each way the hotel do offer a shuttle bus but the times are limited so we never tried it. There is a problem with the sun loungers there are not sufficient of them for the guests and every morning its a battle of the sunbeds with many guests reserving 7 or 8 beds with their towels and no one using them until 3pm which is a real shame and there are notices about not reserving sunbeds. This is a major issue and we went for lunch and someone had taken one of ours even with a bag and sun cream on it. So the battle begins you take someone elses as the pool staff cannot help then someone else is upset......etc.....NOT what you want on holiday. This is a daily occurrence. This is the reason I would not go back to this hotel.    The all inclusive is OK the bars have a fantastic selection of drinks displayed but Bombay Gin Baileys and many others are not included in the all inclusive. Nor is the Moroccan Restaurant included in the all inclusive so beware. Its not a 5 star I would say 3 star. The reception staff and concierge were good. The on site gift shop is good and not overpriced.,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Montguyon, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lynnw599

The pool and pool bar were great as we went in the height of summer the sun beds went very quickly and you had the usual towels down with no one on them! We were all inclusive and the food was good we also dined in the Italian restaurant which was fantastic - would definitely recommend. The room was fab very big and always clean. Only issue we had was that we had no towels for a couple of the days and had to ask several times for replacements. Overall a great holiday and would definitely recommend the Kenzi Menara Palace if you are travelling to Marrakech.,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/548steffp
Kenzi Menara Palace,Sohail S wrote a review Aug 2017,50,"great stay, would definitely recommend","positives:  + the facilities. just to mention a few: free wifi indoor and outdoor pool free shuttle service to and from jema el fnaa (check timetable) currency exchange the spacious size of the rooms and en suite bathrooms the buffet breakfast with a wide variety of food on the menu (something for everyone)  + room service. specifically the maids that clean the rooms. Some days we left our rooms in such a mess and when we returned back to the hotel our rooms were serviced to the highest standards the toiletries were replenished fresh towels and bedding our clothes folded and in a neat pile.  + the hotel staff. they speak a number of languages and are very friendly enthusiastic and eager to help.    Negatives:  - even though there is a sign at the pool which clearly reads you are not allowed to reserve the sun loungers majority of people will ignore this and place a towel and other valueless items such as sun glasses a t-shirt a book empty handbag on the sun loungers early in the morning and return to them hours later. i observed that there would be 15 people in the pool and all the sun loungers will all be taken. The hotel staff do nothing to enforce the ""do not reserve"" policy. It is worth mentioning that a couple staying at the hotel said to me they saw some staff taking generous tips. but this may or may not be true.  - no towels. almost everyday around late afternoon when i would head down to the pool and ask for a towel i would get the same response "" we have ran out of towels please come back in 15 mins"". 1hr later still no towels. in this case It's best just to take the one from your room.  - smoking indoors. i'm from the UK where smoking indoors in any public building is illegal. the law is very different in Morocco where smoking indoors is permitted even at Kenzi Menara Palace a family friendly hotel. most hotels ive stayed at around the world smoking is not permitted and doing so will set off the fire alarms. which makes me question the fire alarms at Kenzi Menara Palce?  - i requested an early check in for 10am which was approved. but when i got to the hotel i was made to wait untill 1pm because the rooms were not available. there was also no complimentary drink upon arrival.  - booking excursions with the hotel is often more expensive you can get better deals from other tour operators near the main square.    overall its a great hotel. the facilities are perfect. the hotel staff friendly and helpful. the price reasonable and affordable. the location just right.",Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sohails953
Kenzi Menara Palace,Clare W wrote a review Aug 2017,20,Beware of hidden exemptions from all inclusive,Lovely hotel but don't come for the all inclusive drinks as there are a lot of exceptions. I don't ask for much in life but a pina colada before dinner and a baileys after dinner are something I always enjoy on holiday. Not here. They're not included and cost a fortune to have. Not impressed for a 5 star hotel. Equally unimpressed with the response from reception and a manager. So beware that your favourite tipple may be denied if you come here. Been to Marrakech twice before and not had an issue as well as lots of other places in the world. Very disappointed and it's only my 2nd night.,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Basingstoke, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/615clarew
Kenzi Menara Palace,909jonathanp wrote a review Aug 2017,30,Good and Bad,So we are coming towards the end of our holiday at Kenzi Menara Palace and feel that there are some things people should know before coming here. Firstly the good. It's in a quiet part of Marrakech with a shuttle bus taking you to and from town. The bedrooms we have (connecting rooms) are very good spacious well air con'd balcony looking on to the pool and well stocked mini fridge which being all inclusive is great to use. The reception and concierge staff have been friendly and helpful concierge taking me out to the cash point which was good of him. The hotel is beautiful to look at and both pools have there advantages. However the down sides the girls serving drinks around the pool are miserable and not very attentive the bar staff can be slow as they talk to each other a lot the pool area plays loud music all day with some songs having explicit words not suitable for children or a family resort. If you want a sunbed you have to put your towel on it so to speak by 8am as by that point the French have already bagsied the good ones. Many people leave there sun beds by 10.30am but leave there belongings on them meaning others are sat on chairs or lying on the grass the hotel could do more about this. The food is not great nor varied much with breakfast being particularly disappointing. For lunch if you want a burger or club sandwich you have to wait til 3pm if all inclusive...why?? Does not make sense. We have travelled a lot staying in a variety of hotels and resorts would I recommend Kenzi Menara...not sure I would to be honest. For the money there is better elsewhere. I am an honest critic not a doom merchant but say it as I see it. We have had a nice holiday but certain things we are now looking forward to leaving for mainly loud explicit music sunbed hogging and poor food.,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Oxfordshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/909jonathanp
Kenzi Menara Palace,katie s wrote a review Aug 2017,50,Can't complain at that price!,Admittedly I have been to many better 5* resorts but for about 10x the price of this one. So although it isn't as good as what you would expect from any other 5* (more like 4*) I have chosen give this 5 out of 5 based on value for money.    We initially only paid for the bed and breakfast option and then paid the extra €55 per day for the all inclusive upgrade. The food wasn't that expensive on a 'pay as you go' basis so you would likely spend less than this (depending of how into your alcohol you are) but for me it saved all the faffing of having to settle bills.    A word of warning there are two 'a la carte' restaurants in the hotel: a morrocan and an Italian. You still have to pay extra for these even if you have paid for all inclusive....which I found very strange. Usually in places like this you can book at the a la cartes once a week or whatever.    Nevertheless as we were only there for 3 nights we found the buffet-style food in the standard restaurant was quite enough.    The room was large and spotless. I couldn't fault a thing with it. The bathroom had both a shower and a bath which is great when your party has different preferences. The fridge also seemed to be stocked twice per day! And if your all inclusive you can help yourself.    The hotel offers free shuttles to abbd from Marrakech centre which is great. Although I would have been happy enough just relaxing at the hotel for the 3 days.    The pool was massive with good quality sun beds. They also have a great gym with a large variety of machines which is kept very tidy!    Overall a great experience at this hotel. It had a few niggles but can't complain with such a bargain.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katiesirett
Kenzi Menara Palace,Swati P wrote a review Aug 2017,40,Great place!,This is a very huge and beautiful inside and out hotel! It is very well looked after. from the moment we checked in all staff were really lovely right to the end of check out! They really go the extra mile to fulfill your ends. As others have mentioned there is a free shuttle bus provided by the hotel to go into the square till 7pm - make sure to take full advantage of that! Only one issue we had which was the breakfast was very repetitive there was nothing added or changed throughout the few days we stayed! They definitely need to change or add some new things in for their breakfast. Oh There is a supermarket behind the hotel which is very cheap! They also have lots of lovely restaurants there - the usual Pizza Hut dominoes etc is there.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Jan wrote a review Aug 2017,50,"Amazing Staff, Service and Hotel!!",We stayed for 7 nights all inclusive and from the day of arrival to the day of departure the service excellence surpassed our expectations.    Cherif the head of concierge on arrival greeted us at the reception and made us feel at ease. After a complimentary mint tea whilst our room was being prepared he explained how to get the best out of our 7 day stay. In his hands we left our tours and visit to the typical Moroccan Hammam and grateful that we did. This gentleman who we now consider a friend will go out of his way for anything and everything to make your stay run smoothly and enjoyable.  My hats off to you Cherif you are an amazing person and we will be forever grateful and looking forward to seeing you again.    The hotel itself is beautiful and the food is amazing! The bedroom is big and the bed was very comfortable the tv also has a good selection of channels. The staff are so friendly and will make sure that all your needs are met to have a relaxing holiday. There is also a shuttle service throughout the day until 7pm that takes you to the square free of charge.    Highly recommend this hotel for your stay in Marrakech. We will definitely be back!,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/748janjan
Kenzi Menara Palace,sarahI5105DZ wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Five star experience,Our first visit to Marrakech couldn't have been more perfect from beginning to end made incredibly special by all the staff at this hotel. We contacted Soukaina at Guest Relations by email prior to departure from the UK who kindly arranged an airport transfer (only 10 minutes away so very well located) and our room was ready on arrival well before the 3pm check in time. We were given such a wonderful welcome by both Soukaina and Cherif (head of concierge) and were offered drinks and breakfast which meant that we could get on with our holiday immediately.    Rooms were huge (we travelled with two children - they had beds in a lounge area with their own balcony TV sofa etc whilst we had the main bedroom with our own balcony TV) the hotel is beautifully maintained inside and out absolutely spotless. Soukaina at Guest Relations checked a number of times to see if we needed anything which was lovely. The staff were incredible and couldn't do enough to make us feel welcome. Cherif was on hand when we needed some help with medication or advice about a trip into Marrakech. The food was amazing and as other reviewers have mentioned the desserts were out of this world. Unlike some all inclusive hotels the food didn't get repetitive which was nice and was of a very high standard. And also unlike some hotels the staff were always asking if we wanted drinks or a snack. All the waiting staff bar staff chefs housekeeping front of house staff and animation team were incredible I cannot praise them all highly enough. It is very obvious that there's a great rapport between them all and this transmits to the guests.    Hotel was at about 50% occupancy so there were always plenty of sun loungers available around the huge main pool. Restaurants were never busy but had enough atmosphere. Lots of space in this hotel to find a corner for a quiet drink or a change of scene. They seem to be able to successfully cater for families with children as well as younger adults and older people. There was a DJ at the poolside who cleverly catered for all musical tastes and played relaxed tunes in the morning and afternoon and in between more lively music for those that wished to participate in aqua aerobics or water polo. It was never intrusive. The animation team were friendly and inclusive but not pushy which was perfect. The evenings were accompanied by relaxed live music.    The hotel provides a free shuttle service into Marrakech centre at regular times during the day which we took advantage of. The hotel also arranged for a driver to take us round the sites during a morning (we took in the YSL gardens new city the square the palace) for a very reasonable price. This was great given the soaring temperatures with two children which made it very easy.    We booked this hotel as we wanted guaranteed sun and lots of it relaxation in luxury surroundings and some culture. The hotel delivered on every level. We were so delighted with our stay that we would like to book to return next year! We cannot fault this hotel or staff. We arrived as strangers to Marrakech but left having made lots of friends and we look forward to seeing everyone at the hotel again next year.

Kenzi Menara Palace,JosieElizabeth wrote a review Jul 2017,30,Let down in a few areas,I visited the Kenzi Menara for a week in July 2017. First impressions of the hotel were very good; the lobby area was very impressive and we were able to access our room despite arriving much earlier than the 3pm check in time. The room was a fantastic size and had a wonderful bathroom (seperate bath and shower and separate toilet). However it was a little rough around the edges: for example we had tea and coffee making facilities but no kettle and the air conditioning was nowhere near cold enough which affected our sleep.    The buffet restaurant left a lot to be desired (the food didn't vary throughout our stay) but the pool bar and the Italian restaurant were good. I stayed as part of an all-inclusive package so was limited on the times I could visit the restaurants (for example I could only lunch at the pool bar between 3pm and 5pm) so bear that in mind. The all-inclusive offering was definitely much more limited in terms of drinks options than for the pay-as-you-go guests (no moijitos or margaritas!) and the bar didn't always have the ingredients required to make the cocktails offered to all-inclusive guests (such as rum?!) so again something to consider.    The main pool is large and a lovely temperature and there were plenty of sunloungers so no early morning towel reservation required. However the pool 'entertainment' was unacceptably loud and is the main reason for my average rating. Music was piped out all day as standard and several times a day a DJ ramped up the volume with what can only be described as the worst DJing I've ever experienced - the music mainly consisted of Moroccan rap the volume was constantly being adjusted and songs were being played over each other. At one point the DJ decided to set up a 'musical statues' competition for the children so the entire pool area had to suffer loud music stopping and starting at random intervals. Despite our pleas to the staff to turn the music down and our attempts to move around the pool area in search of the quietest area we were unable to escape the noise (my iPod did not have enough volume to even make a dent in the mandatory pool entertainment) and unfortunately this really affected our stay.    Overall the hotel itself was lovely and was definitely good value for money. However based purely on the pool entertainment (and the infuriating lack of staff response despite several complaints from several guests) we would not return to the hotel.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Braintree, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josieb985

All the staff spoke excellent English (given their 2nd language is French - being an old french colony).    During our stay the waiters in the main dining area during breakfast and lunch were excellent and attentive the pool bar staff and evening bar staff were also excellent! The waiters in the main dining area of an evening were few and far between! And the staff which were on were not great we had to wait for ages to get their attention to order a drink. The food was nice enough but as with every all inclusive gets a bit samey... The deserts were something else!    The housekeeping staff came daily and there were cleaners around all day sweeping the common areas very clean hotel!    If you like a boozy late nights then you will need to venture to the clubs outside of the hotel. The all inclusive finishes at 11.30pm which is absolutely fine on the welcome paper we were issued it states after this time drinks will be charged... again no problem!! However the bar actually closes at 11.30pm and you cannot buy/order drinks in the hotel.    The rooms are very spacious with large bathroom! The main pool is big with a smaller kids pool there were always available sun beds even if you like a later start on your holidays! The staff around the pool will help with moving beds/umbrellas etc if you ask.    The wi-fi is a little slow - but YOUR ON HOLIDAY SO ENJOY IT!!!

The minute we arrived we were welcomed by Sherif we didn't have to worry about a thing; I've never been asked to sit down offered a cool drink and they took charge of the rest. The pool is amazing; as soon as we arrived by the pool the pool attendants organised our sun loungers with cushions and towels - this was bliss and made for a truly relaxing stay. We could leave our lounger go for dip and a swim on the way up to the Pool Bar at the other end get a drink a pool snack perhaps after the Aqua Aerobics at 11am which we did and was great fun. Aqua Zumba was on offer if you still had some energy left in the afternoon. On our first night we chose to eat in the Moroccan restaurant for an additional charge the experience was worth it - Ali the Restaurant Manager was very friendly and helpful and we had a wonderful meal accompanied by Moroccan musicians. The buffet the next day was equally splendid and the food amazing with a huge choice of salads tangines to chef's specials and amazing mini deserts. Ali and his team of waiters were brilliant and were so friendly their sincerity crossed over into remembering your drinks from the evening before. The staff in the Hotel enhanced our stay because they were so lovely. We were all inclusive and had a Delux room with single beds. The room shower and beds were incredible and the beds so comfy I had no difficulty sleeping at all. Maids kept our rooms cleaned beds turned with fancy little details with rose petals and our towels were refreshed daily. The gardens and facilities were exceptionally tidy and clean. I can't fault this ideallic place I intend to go back again.

I was queuing patiently to be served but once a French speaking person who had money in he's hand start speaking French to the barman ! Yep you guessed -he got served before me WRONG!! Wasn't until the 2nd day we tried the pool snacks the menu was priced it wasn't until a fellow English family said it with the all inclusive -nobody had said to us from the the hotel WRONG !!  We ordered 2 burger and chips the first come after 45 mins !!! My wife stated eating and I asked staff about mine .all he kept saying was ""2mins"" rather rude. Mine come 14mins after my wife's by this time I had a enough of the rudeness and the timescale for a simple meal so we went and made a complaint to reception .    The hotel it's self is stunning and 90%of the staff are pleasant and welcoming but iam afraid it's the whole pool bar area that lets it down.

Kenzi Menara Palace,350Bullet wrote a review Jun 2017,10,Solely disappointed... a shame as it looks fantastic.,First impressions wow... lasting impression. Awful!    We booked a room and breakfast only.    The room:  The room was large and spacious giving the feel of a 5* hotel. The patio door lock was broken and wasn't fixed even though I asked. The towel rail fell off the wall landing on my girlfriends foot leaving a bruise and again it wasn't fixed. I didn't make a big deal as we were on the second floor and doubted anyone was going to scale the wall to get in. The seal around the shower was tired and leaked water when in use. The toilet paper was a budget product that you'd expect to find in a public toilet and the toiletries had no fragrance. The air conditioning worked okay albeit a little noisy. The wifi isn't great many times I had to sit by the door for it to work. The general condition of the room was tired but clean.    The pool and snack bar:  We headed to to pool to relax for the afternoon and grab a drink and lunch after a long journey. Our first real shock were the prices of everything. We ordered a fruit salad a salad one beer and a cocktail. Total €32!!! The fruit salad was a small glass with chopped fruit in a sickly syrup like a tinned one..for €6.50; A small salad with a little tinned tuna at €7.50; a small badly made cocktail for €13 and a small Heineken which was €5. Hungry and shocked we made the most of it but we're now extremely concerned about the week ahead. We then ordered two 1.5l bottles of water that we were charged €7 for (€3.50 each).The staff had a can't be bothered attitude. We were now thinking should we have paid the extra €55 each per day for all inclusive.    The pool is fantastic and large as were the sun beds and relaxing areas. The mattress were foam with material that had stains from sun cream and sweat with a few rips. They seem to have been changing them as towards the end of the week new vinyl covered ones were showing up. Most of the towels were thread bear and needed replacing. Not really acceptable for a so called 5* hotel.    The restaurants:  We ate in their Moroccan restaurant on the first night. We ordered two mains one beer and a half bottle of wine which came too €45. Fine if the meal had been an amazing quality but it really wasn't and the portion size was enough for a small child. They add 10% on top for 'service' which was quite frankly nonchalant.    Chin up we thought day two would be better. Unfortunately we were consumed with the unreal prices of food and water that are on par if not higher than London or the French Rivera.    As water was going to be a big issued we made the daily trek to the supermarket to buy 6 x 1.5l bottles for the princely sum of 3.50 Dirhams each that works out about 35cents. So six bottles came too €2.10 much less than one bottle in the hotel. As you're not allowed to bring food or drink into the hotel we had to smuggle them in. We would have spent easily 100€ on water for the week in this weather if we hadn't.    Breakfast was a buffet consisting of leftovers from the previous night Luke warm and sometimes cold soups and several times we were given luke warm or cold pots of coffee. Birds were flying in and around the food area eating and sh***ing everywhere.    We asked about the cost of the buffet restaurant for one night which was €30 each. We aren't big eaters so opted for the a la carte Italian instead. Again don't bother. It was revolting.    The complimentary shuttle service:  Runs a few times a day but the last return is 19:15 so if you want to eat in town you must take a taxi back. Around €12 for the 4km journey.    There were many other things but I'm not going to go on and on as it's fundamentally a nice hotel. They are basically an average 3* hotel playing at being a top quality establishment with chefs that haven't a clue how to prepare and cook quality food or make cocktails. They have you cornered being out of town so you have to pay whatever they ask.    After the second day we looked at changing our flights and leaving. If we hadn't of had to pay for the full seven days we'd have left straight away.    My advice as far as food goes is to eat in town at one of the many street food establishments with the locals. The food was tasty succulent and Moroccan as you can get. Or you go all inclusive and accept the quality of the food is sub standard but you can eat and drink as much as you like.,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Greater London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/350Bullet
Kenzi Menara Palace,Bates-forsyth wrote a review Jun 2017,40,Lovely break but not 5 star,"The hotel is ""nice"" and overall for a week it served us well however this is not a 5 star hotel.    The food and pool bar staff really really let the whole experience down.  I was not expecting silver service and having read the previous reviews went with a certain expectation that the food would not be amazing but really it was worse than I had thought it was like basic school dinners in the main restaurant and the only saving grace was that for the all inclusive package you could also eat in the Italian dining room which was actually much better and the service very good and would highly recommend going there when you lose the will to live with the buffet!  The pool was amazing and the hotel was only about a third full so plenty of space for everyone. The one downside was the rude poolside bar staff again people have made previous comments on this and I did experience this throughout my week there. It wasn't a language thing as I speak both French and English and even spoke in both languages to the staff and it is fair to say they are less than 5 star! To the point that based on the bar staff I would not return to the hotel again.  Customer relations manager and reception was brilliant and maybe the poolside staff should take some tips from them.    As a fitness instructor I had some work to do everyday and the gym and studio was excellent and was very impressed. I managed to use the facilities for work and was very happy.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Kellysmith88 wrote a review Jun 2017,40,Lovely quiet break,The pool was huge and amazing. Sun beds really comfy and the hotel provided clean towels to use daily. The gardens were stunning and well maintained daily. The reception area was lovely with fresh flowers used which made it smell beautiful. The rooms were clean large and specious.  Breakfast wasn't amazing it was fine to have daily but not a lot of variety or very flavoursome (everything tasted quite plain). Lots of tiny birds which meant that sometimes they nibbled on the food or pooped on the seats! Same with the restaurant (Italian restaurant) - the food was plain but well presented. If you are not all inclusive drinks are quite expensive.  Wifi was a bit hit and miss for me (iPhone & iPad) but my partner had better luck (Samsung) than I did.  Although you can pay extra for a pool view room to have a view of the mountains it's rare you will be able to see them even on a clear day.,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leeds, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kellysmith88

The mini bar was replenished daily with soft drinks.  The food was excellent - especially the exquisite desserts.  The hotel grounds were exquisite- such beautiful gardens.  Although the main pool had no water in it as it was being painted for the high season the hotel was very quiet so it did not seem crowded around the smaller pool.  We were looking for a relaxing break which is exactly what we got. There is little to do in the evening and very few activities in the day but if you want a chilled out break with lovely hot weather this is the ideal place!,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,dorset,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacksam
Kenzi Menara Palace,LordBoon wrote a review Jun 2017,10,Disappointing beyond belief.,I try and keep my reviews honest and factual they are my views and my not be shared by everyone or anyone come to that. This hotel has the biggest swimming pool in Marrakech shame it didn't have any water in it throughout my week long stay. No one mentioned this when i booked this hotel through a very well known travel company who do not let you leave anything negative about their products regardless of whether they are true ! nor did the hotel reception mention it when i checked in in fact they lied and said it would be ready in a couple of days it wasn't. When i complained they told me to use the children pool charming for a +VIP Signature 5 star hotel.  Breakfast was included in my package so was a flock of sparrows who quite happily ate anything on a plate didn't queue at the buffet just dive bombed in at the bread and croissants without a thought for us paying guests. I won't mention where their droppings were seen out of respect for other paying guests suffice to say don't eat the muesli. The staff were a bit like the wifi worked when it wanted to and constantly let you down rude on occasion too. The room was great and so were the gardens. Overall very disappointing and would never stay there again.

The staff however were very apologetic and offered my family a free lunch which we accepted. The management and staff were very accommodating and friendly in general! Very impressed! Thankfully there was also a ""kids"" pool area but to be honest this pool was big enough and deep enough for adults too - so the lack of the main pool actually didn't bother us in the end! The place smells amazing by the way - its called Flower of Orange - get it from the gift shop! Rooms were massive well furnished and every super clean. Good wifi (especially bizarrely by the pool) great shuttle service that takes you into town every morning and bring you back at set times. Otherwise staff happy to order you a taxi which literally appears in 2 mins. Buffet breakfast was the kids favourite and the buffet lunch was good too. Unfortunately we ate out every night so cant comment on the restaurants. Nice bar with live music...just a great and lovely hotel to stay in with some of the friendliest staff.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Suzi H wrote a review Jun 2017,50,The nicest hotel I've ever been in,My fiancé and I are both 27 and have been in an awful lot of all inclusive hotels/resorts. This hotel was hands down the nicest most welcoming most helpful hotel we've ever been in. We ended up here by accident when our BA flight was cancelled. Considering 150 of us were dropped off at short notice they got us to our rooms within 10 minutes and all had smiles on their faces. Nothing was too much trouble. They help you to your rooms with your bags which was so nice considering the hotel is so big and there were so many of us at one time. The room was stunning. Every single room has a private terrace or a balcony and the rooms themselves are huge. Beds so comfy. We had dressing gowns and a huge bath and a shower and a separate toilet. Tea coffee facilities and mini bar. We had a choice of several teas peach camomile mint... complimentary water as well as the mini bar. There's a huge room service menu available 24 hours a day at reasonable prices. Even the room service lady was so so nice and helpful. All men are addressed as 'sir' and ladies as 'madam'.  The staff the next day were so helpful when we were trying to find out what was going on with our flight. We personally ended up staying 2 more nights. I thought £100 a night was nothing for all you get. They have 2 pools. One is absolutely huge and the other is small but still big. The bar is great loads of selections of alcoholic drinks again with nice fun staff. There is an entertainment team but they aren't in your face trying to force you to do stuff. The sun beds by the pool are fantastic. So comfy. If you go an ask for cushions for them they insist on bringing them to you and giving you a towel as well which I thought was a really nice touch. Breakfast lunch and dinner were lovely. I literally could not fault the hotel on anything.  Also the spa is great too get a massage it's about £40 for a full body massage for 50 mins which was actually an hour.,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/999suzih

Very good amenities including strong Wi-Fi and free shuttle bus to/from Medina a few times per day.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Jools4971 wrote a review Jun 2017,40,"Great hotel, but main pool was closed!",We booked this trip via Secret Escapes - in fact a reseller for Jestsun Holidays. No problem with that - the booking process was very efficient and all went smoothly. First impressions of the hotel were great - very pleasant surroundings and clearly five star (for Marrakech and you have to accept that 5 star in Paris or London for example is not necessarily the same all over the world). Check in was simple but we had an issue - the main pool was closed 'for maintenance' so we were reduced to the much smaller children's pool. We were not happy about this but we're encouraged to settle into our rooms and then go for a wander. The rooms were fabulous - we had two interconnecting rooms so that our 14 yr old boys had their own space - they are perhaps the largest 'standard' rooms we have had anywhere we have travelled with huge beds very large bathroom minibar tea and coffee smart TV with plenty of channels and a large balcony. Can't fault them. The hotel itself is not too large so never felt crowded albeit I think occupancy was down due to the lack of the main swimming pool (more on that later). So we settled in to our rooms and went for a wander around the hotel. The 'small' pool is indeed small albeit enough to cool off in but we were upset that our visions of a large pool that we could play around in had been dashed. It was apparently closed for emergency maintenance - the reality was it was closed for annual maintenance (including a full re-paint) which you would have thought they could have done out of season - somewhat frustrating. We spoke at length with reception and they offered to transfer us to their other hotel the Agdal Club - another 'five' star. We decided a pool was important to us - two 14 year olds yada yada - so we decided to move. The hotel sorted out a transfer for us and were really very helpful indeed. When we arrived at the Agdal Club we were really disappointed with the rooms - nowhere near as good as the Kenzi Menara and we all felt a bit downhearted to be honest. After a bit of a family debate I went back to reception with my biggest 'sorry!' face on and asked if we could go back to the Kenzi Menara. Again nothing was too much for the hotel staff and they were happy to transfer us back. So despite some of the other reviews you may have read I have nothing but praise for the Kenzi staff generally - they have given us top notch service in the face of an 'awkward' set of guests!  So far as the rest of our stay at the Menara Palace is concerned it has been very good indeed. They run a free shuttle bus into the centre of Marrakech and back again every two hours throughout the day the 'all inclusive' option really is what it says - aside from a few international brands of spirits (I paid 90 Dirham - about £7- for a very large baileys for my wife one evening). The only slight downside is the food. Nothing wrong with the quality at all well cooked and very tasty but not a great selection in the main restaurant (albeit this again may be because of what we perceived to be a relatively low level of occupancy) but you do have the choice of the Italian restaurant and the Moroccan restaurant (100 Dirham / £8 per head supplement) if you wish. Given that most people visit Marrakech for relatively short breaks I think you can live with this but It would get somewhat repetitive if you were here for more than a week I think.  All in all a hotel to be recommended. Staff were very pleasant fabulous rooms and good quality throughout.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Pippa S wrote a review May 2017,20,"Average, disappointing, frustrating...",Just returned from my third visit to this hotel. Previously I've raved about it 'great place fab venue'....unfortunately I can't rave anymore too many disappointing issues made it a less than satisfactory stay....    Food - Breakfast was ok but not amazing - there's birds flying around the restaurant and they will poop where they like including on the tables & chairs - this never seems to get cleaned up so watch where you sit. If you leave food unaccompanied on your table (couple goes up to buffet together) the birds will take their pick off your plate. Quite grim. Dinner buffet is grossly overpriced...we tried it once and didn't go back.    Wifi - So infuriating. I had work to do don't worry 'there's full wifi' - genuinely the slowest and most inefficient wifi I have ever come across. It's not just slow it doesn't work. If I was lucky I could get wifi from the toilet so had to sit on the loo with my laptop and email clients. When I've been in the past the wifi wasn't an issue. Now....it's absolutely laughable. So annoying and impossible if you intend to do any work/watch netflix/check into your flight.    Key Card - Your keycard will not work if it goes near your phone credit cards leaves the premises...or GETS IN THE SUN. It's Morocco for goodness sake the sun shines. 3 times I left the pool area and my room key wouldn't work. I was in the far end of the resort - 10 mins walk back to reception to sort my key before another 10 mins back to the room. Seriously if your key cards are that terrible there's nothing wrong with keys. So frustrating.    Room - Spacious & clean generally but on our arrival there were a number of issues which could have been avoided. 3 bulbs didn't work kettle was broken balcony table was broken...this did all get sorted but why check guests into a room that was already sub-standard?    Shower - shower didn't drain properly so I had to have a shower in stages...so rather than a nice refreshing shower I had to turn the water off every 90 seconds and wait for the tray to drain.    Staff entrance/exit - If you want to leave the premises you have to go out the main gates and absolutely categorically cannot go out the 'staff exit' - a different gate. If you want to go to the nearby mall/Carrefour (supermarket) the 'guest gate' is on completely the wrong side of the complex. What could be a 5 minute walk to the mall (via staff gate) becomes a 15min schlep through a wasteland. They're all gates why let guests out of one and not the other? Feels like you're just trying to inconvenience us further...    I used to love this hotel and I took my Mum on recommendation. I'm now very embarrassed to have recommended it - it was a shambles.

Kenzi Menara Palace,AnthonyPS wrote a review May 2017,40,Great Hotel,The hotel itself is brilliant a stunning looking hotel inside and out also very clean and well kept! We also arrived 3 hours early before I check in time of which they gave us our inclusive wristbands and let us have lunch early and got us checked in within an hour. There are also a few shops within the hotel incase you have forgotten anything or want anything to take home. They also run a shuttle bus to the city and back throughout the day which we used and is very handy.    Our room was great nicely laid out and very clean bathroom was nice and mini fridge had an okay selection of beverages. Our room had a nice view if the weather permitted it the Atlas Mountains were just visible. Although I'm aware some rooms don't share this luxury of over looking the pool and grounds. Also the pillows and beds were very comfortable!    The restaurant for the all inclusive is great too start off with. It's a buffet with a themed area each night. Foods vary from pasta too Moroccan tagines. The desserts were great I'll include some pictures. Although breakfast was probably the best as the food did become a bit sickly after a while with our last two nights eating less and less. Think it maybe the oil or herbs used. My advice for a per longed stay is go out and eat more often than we did. The pool bar food is okay again just clean and is a decent standard.    The service was great across the board everyone was so polite and friendly. Although some ma English was definitely not as good as others. Maybe handy too brush up on some French. The only flaw we have was the photographer who was also very polite and friendly but was a bit too pushy.    The pool area very spacious and clean loads of sunbeds towels readily available next to the bar. Cabanas too lay in. Ping pong tables and the outside bar all good.    The O-Spa was very nice and clean. Staff were very friendly I had a massage which I personally found very nice treatment in comparison too others I've experienced. The spa pool was a nice change. The sauna is a bit misleading as it's primarily a hot floor opposed too actually a hot room But still rather relaxing. The gym was good much better than expected from a hotel gym.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Steven L wrote a review May 2017,50,Great Hotel. Great People.,We had the honor to visit the Kenzi Menara for the first time for a medium-budget one week getaway. As a familiy of four (Kids 11 and 15) we had booked our stay online. Needless to say you do get a bit uncomfy when you arrive at a new place. Then what a surprise: Badr and Soukhaina from guest relations expressed such a great and warm welcome we felt „at home“ at once. So we had a great start of our one week stay at Kenzi Menara.    > Wonderful Gardens  The premises and gardens of the hotel is where you spend most of your time. Well I must say all was kept „spic and span“! Beautifully groomed lawns fllowers trees - wonderful. I must add that we stayed in late spring so everything was in full blossom. The pool area is spacious although I can imagine it gets crowded at full capacity and on weekends. Downside here: Bum bum bum from the animation corner. Solution: Talk to the guys tell them you’d like to relax and enjoy some peace them give em a tip and tell em to pump up the volume around happy hour again. Works!    > Great Location  The hotel is perfectly situated just a few minutes from the Medina. So if you’d like to take a trip to the desert or to deep dive into local culture - all is at your fingertips. Speaking of tips. Always make sure you have the odd bill in your pocket and to tip wisely - this could bump your experience up one notch no matter if at the hotel or in any other serviced enviroment (restaurant taxi…)    > Nice Rooms  Back to the hotel or better: The rooms: As said we had booked online with a „Garden View“. Luckily enough the hotel was not at full capacity so management gave us a complimentary upgrade to „Pool View“. Both views are great with a „Garden View“ you might get a bit of noise from the street that runs on one side of the premises. The rooms are great: Lot’s of space yes even for hanging more that two shirts… Our kids stayed in the adjacent room so we had enough space to hang out. Downside here: WiFi is rather weak in some corners of the rooms. I measured 5Mbit/s download and 1Mbit/s upload - if any. Solution: If you need to get some work done place yourself at a table in the court. Oh yeah the WiFi around the pool area works at about the same speed - if at all. But then again you’re on holiday not on a business trip…    > Tasty Food  The hotel as a few specialty restaurants and a main restaurant (buffet self-service) We didn’t try the Maroccan restaurant as we preferred to enjoy the Moroccan cuisine from the buffet. They do a great job the Chef himself is very present AND pleasant. Our son got hooked on Kefta Meatballs. No problem - the chef would get that whipped out of the kitchen with a snap! I suggest to take an „all inclusive“ approach. Great way to keep things easy and to have an odd beer or club sandwich over at the nice pool bar. Downside: The Moroccan Night started out great - cheerful music lots of singing in the dining room. But after an hour of sing and dance (during dinner) we had to leave. Just too loud and hectic for a nice dinner. 20 minutes would have been just fine. Solution: Grab a glass of wine and sit outside. Speaking of outside seating: There’s plenty of room. So why not sit outside in the shade and chill!    > Great People  As mentioned in the intro Badr Soukhaina from guest relations the waiters the „pool brigade“ - everyone is very warm and supportive. We’ve stayed at places like the Saint Géran in Mauritius before. Of course you can not compare the two. But still this hotel in our minds is top. We stayed at another hotel in Marrakech before - but we’d always be happy to return to the Kenzi Menara.    > Final Thoughts  If you’re looking for a nice place to stay in Marrakech with your family for 7 to 10 days with a nice pool and garden area great food and best of all - friendly people - don’t look any further.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Zug, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/891stevenl

The food at the hotel was excellent if a bit repetitive but the quality couldn't be faulted. The major drawback to this holiday for us was all the smokers everywhere in all the public areas. We would have loved to have spent the evenings in the bar but it was so smokey it was unbearable so we spent more time in our room than we normally would. Also it would have be fantastic to have been able to swim in the stunning pool but it was just so cold.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Paul H wrote a review May 2017,30,"Overall Quite nice, but lacking in a few areas.",The hotel was generally nice  However we had a room with ants running around in it and the AC wasn't working which made the first to nights unpleasant .    We did ask for a room move but the hotel couldn't grant us this which was odd as it must have been less than 50% full  We also requested a travel cot however on the third attempt we did get the travel cot rather then a folding bed this I put down to a language issue rather then anything else.    We had eaten in the hotel on the first night with me having had a tagine this was quite nice however this unfortunately put me out of action for the next day - if you get what I mean...    The staff were generally quite pleasant  apart from a very poor understanding of English which you wouldn't expect from an international hotel.    There quite a few other issues which we were given compensation by free use of the indoor pool for a week which I think was around 10-15 euros a day (can't quite recall but I recall it being a little pricey.    The facilities and bar seemed to be pretty good and the piano bar was a nice touch for the one night it had the piano chap playing.  The shuttle was hourly to the town otherwise you can haggle the taxis down to about 60-70 Direms .    The Wifi was ok which was good so I could send a few emails etc.    So all in all not a poor experience but I would consider other options when I return.

Someone took care of our luggage and the receptionist was a really friendly guy.  The second impression otherwise was not as good as the first. Our bedroom was nice and really huge but the bathroom was disappointing. The shower facility was all over with chalk and furthermore our towel rack was half broken. The cleaning ladies weren't very organized. We missed any kind of towels several times and had to asked for new ones every third day.  As we came down to the pool we recognized that the sun beds and the towels provided were old and sometimes even busted and the pool was not as clean as we would have expected it in a 5* hotel.  Most of the staff was kind and attentive even though they had trouble speaking english. The food was ok but also not what we expected in a 5* hotel. It was nearly every day the same with not much variety.  A really good reason on the other hand to stay at this hotel is the guest relations lady Soukaina. She was talking to us every night we came back from Marrakesh and wanted to know how our day was and gave us a lot of good suggestions what to do in the city. Furthermore she arranged several cabs especially in the nights for us so we did not have to pay the tourist price. She was amazing and a really nice kind and attentive women. The other good thing was the shuttle back and forth to the city center that runs 5 times a day.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Kiel, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Janina849
Kenzi Menara Palace,bellww wrote a review May 2017,20,Also disappointing,William B    We stayed at the Kenzi Meara Palace for a week in May. The guests at the hotel were a mix of tourists and those attending Moroccan corporate seminars. The food and service in the restaurant was mostly Moroccan and not at all satisfactory. The price of 70 drms for the smallest bottle of Heineken beer and 100drms for a hamburger was not locally competitive to other similar hotels restaurants and bars. The pool area was not clean and broken glass was found on the poolside paved areas. The sun beds and pool towels provided were old and tired and not encouraging. The bar was uninviting and there was smoking in all areas. Whilst staying there one of us contracted stomach bug and the other athlete’s foot. The facilities enable a 5-star rating but the hotel desperately needs a refit to modern standards. The staff were kind and attentive and tried hard to please but unfortunately there was no organisation without any real leadership. The only good point was the situation being a 10 mins free mini bus ride to the centre of Marrakech. Of yes I nearly forgot to mention that after complaining we did receive a room upgrade and my wife a manicure.,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Guildford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bellww

Kenzi Menara Palace,Sophie D wrote a review May 2017,20,Disappointing,On arrival to the hotel I was impressed by its appearance and grandeur when we checked in we were asked if we could take a seat after 5 mins the receptionist came and told us they had over booked so we were being moved to another hotel for one night! We were only here for 4 nights as it was but we were assured that the hotel we were moving to was also 5* and we would still be all inclusive and on return we would be upgraded. We were moved to jardins de l'agdal would class it myself as 3* the rooms were in desperate need of an upgrade! We decided to go and get some lunch so decided to check with reception what restaurants were included with all inclusive to be told we were only down as full board and would have to pay for drinks and mini bar. We explained that at menera palace we were all inclusive. The receptionist rang original hotel who asked to speak to my husband in which he was told that we could GI and get a drink or food at menara using the bus or pay for extras at the new hotel!! I'm sorry but this is unexceptable the error was their fault surely they should make it easy for us. My husband argued and in the end they agreed to fork the bill. I was unimpressed with the food at jardins and certainly was not what we paid for!  The next day we had been told we would be able to check in at midday so at midday we made our way to menera palace via the bus on arrival we were told again to take a seat after 10 mins the receptionist came over to say our room was not ready and it would be an hour max. So went to get a drink in the bar and have a walk around the grounds. We headed back to reception after about 50 mins after the hour had passed I made my way back to the reception desk where I was told it was still not ready but shouldn't be long. After a further 10mins I went to speak to the guest relations lady who gave us our inclusive wrist bands and apologised for us having to be moved. I spoke to the gentleman on reception about our room who said it would be another 40mins as he was upgrading us to a pool view room in which I said well that's the least you can do I did complain again at this point and then hey presto within 5 seconds room ready!  The room was lovely very spacious and a nice bathroom however overall I do not think this is 5* I felt service throughout hotel was poor with exception to guest relations and the person who showed us to our room in the pool bar we has to wait along time to be served for food and the service at times in the restaurant (buffet) was not impressive. We had dinner in the Moroccan restaurant which was a waste of an evening I ended up just eating the bread rolls and ice cream. They got my dessert order wrong but after waiting 2 hours I could not be bothered to send it back.  I have stayed in other 5* hotels throughout the world all of which have come with pool side service turn down service and little extras all of which this hotel has none.  The hotel is clean and food was nice pool area lovely however I do not understand why they take the cushions off the loungers it just makes guests have to wait while they get them out of storage and the pool is very cold.  Next time I come to morocco I will be looking at staying at another hotel.,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/888SophieD888
Kenzi Menara Palace,andy1234567800 wrote a review May 2017,50,Loved it. Very relaxing and friendly staff,Stayed for five nights at the end of March. Booked it fairly last minute and got a good price from secret escapes. (About £600 per person including flights). Deal was all inclusive.    There were a lot of different options for food and the wine that was included was also nice.you could also get food at the pool bar during the afternoon. All inclusive included a large variety of drinks you would have to pay for the more expensive brands but I thought the selection was perfectly fine. The only criticism I would have about the food is there are two additional restaurants an Italian and a Moroccan restaurant. You have to pay a small surcharge for the Moroccan restaurant. With all inclusive you pay a bit more but get a very limited menu compared to if you weren't all inclusive. I'd rather have been given the full menu with the option of paying for the meal than be limited. A part from that I would just recommend eating from the buffet. The chefs were very good at changing the options and the food was delicious.    Our room had a balcony overlooking the two pools and plenty of space. The beds were extremely comfortable. Very clean and had a minibar which was included in the price.    Staff were always friendly and very helpful.    If you're getting currency I would strongly advise against going to money corp at the airport. We didn't realise it at the time but there rates are terrible. It was significantly cheaper to pay or withdraw money on credit card when we were out there. One frustration was the hotel couldn't change the larger notes to small change. There is a strong culture of tipping in Morocco but without smaller change it either makes it expensive or you feel a bit stingy for not tipping.    Had a couple of massages when we were there. I would recommend having one if you're keen on massages as they were good.    On the whole a very good experience and very relaxing.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Taiba B wrote a review May 2017,50,Paradise on Earth and Fantastic Location & Service,I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights in May and had an amazing experience.    My husband and I came for our honeymoon and we received a free upgrade on arrival to a honeymoon suite which was huge in size with two bathrooms and two terraces. It definitely exceeded our expectations and was beautiful.    The welcome given by staff on arrival was lovely and we were greeted with Moroccan tea which we loved when we arrived to check in.    Our booking also included breakfast and the breakfast buffet (served daily from 6am-10:30am) had a range on Moroccan and continental breakfast foods all of a high quality and made fresh on request and in front of you.    Our visit also included a trip to the spa for a massage and use of the indoor pool which was very relaxing. The indoor spa pool is only free for spa guests but as I had a massage booked they let my husband join me for free. This was one instance of exemplary service received by the hotel staff during our stay.    In terms of hotel location it is a convenient 5-10minutes drive from the Airport and 10minute drive from the medina. There is a Free shuttle bus which goes 3x a day to and from the medina for use by guests which my husband and I enjoyed using.  As the resort is slightly away from the medina we were able to enjoy a huge hotel of this size which they have decorated to look like a paradise on Earth. The gardens were beautiful and mountains can be seen from the distance when sunbathing by the outdoor pool. It was very beautiful and Lush.    The concierge Cheriff was very friendly and greeted us as you would greet an old friend. He personally created individual tours for us to Atlas Mountains dinner reservations and a city sightseeing tour with a tour guide who was very informative and friendly (Hassan). The price of these tours were also very competitive and we found them to be cheaper than the ones found advertised externally.    I think perhaps my own criticism of this hotel is that it doesn't include a dental kit (toothbrush and toothpaste) as part of the bathroom toiletries. However when we spoke to staff they provided us with one straight away.    I booked this hotel from a personal family recommendation I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel resort to my own friends and family for its: hospitable staff location luxury value for money and food choices (they can also cater to gluten free & coeliac guests).    If we visit marrakech again we would definitely be staying at the Kenzi Menara Palace.,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Oxford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/413taibab
Kenzi Menara Palace,Rachel D wrote a review May 2017,40,A base to explore Marrakech from,The hotel is a traditional Moroccan style hotel which although a little tired in places has a lovely feel with fabulous gardens plentiful sun loungers and a large pool. We had a huge suite and enjoyed the fact that although not in a Riad you felt as though you were in Morocco rather than a generic hotel.    The staff are helpful and pleasant the receptionists are attentive cleaners hard working guest relations lady excellent and Cherif the concierge was fantastic. Luckily for us our Thomson rep didn't bother attending our reception meeting so Cherif recommended and arranged all the visits for us on an individual basis. All our tour guides were good but Hassan who took us to the Atlas mountains was outstanding - friendly informative and very accommodating. Ask for him if you go!    In the buffet restaurant the food is great quality and delicious but a bit limited. The main problem is the service as the overworked staff come under immense pressure when there are conferences being held. At these times the restaurant is crowded and noisy and standards and smiles slip as there are too few waiting-on staff to cope with the huge influx of guests therefore you spend a lot of time waiting for cutlery and drinks and tables are left uncleared. It really isn't the waiters' faults the hotel needs to employ far more of them to cope. The restaurant management could do more to help other than just folding napkins and watching proceedings. We only saw one restaurant manager (an older gentleman) actually getting involved with making sure guests were served and happy otherwise there is a very obvious job demarcation with staff sticking to their roles. This is also obvious at the pool bar.    On nights when there are no conferences the hotel has a totally different feel altogether. The outside buffet was wonderful being entertained by the musicians with relaxed smiling staff and delicious tagines was a lovely experience. The moroccan restaurant is also wonderful with a much better staff to guest ratio. The Italian restaurant was nice with excellent quality food and service just a little lacking in atmosphere.    The all inclusive option offers excellent value to the extent that you really don't mind paying to eat out when you feel like it. The wine is perfectly fine but other drinks options are unbranded spirits so we stuck to wine or paid the extra. We loved the lobby bar and the staff there it had such a lovely feel to it and the staff were very chatty.    In conclusion the hotel is a great place to explore and relax the wonderful Marrakech just try to go when there aren't any conferences on!,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Chester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/racheldawson2017

Kenzi Menara Palace,Nick S wrote a review May 2017,50,"Lovely location, great views and service",We stayed for a week at this hotel for my wife's birthday. We chose this hotel as it was just outside the hustle and bustle of Marrakesh.    The complex has 3 restaurants and a couple of bars. We originally stayed bed and breakfast but upgraded to all inclusive which made a big difference for us celebrating although it's not essential to have.    On clear days the view of the mountains is spectacular and the 50m pool and spa are a lovely luxury. However the best part of the hotel is the staff they were very helpful when organising trips and would do anything to help if required. There are a couple of these hotels around Marrakesh and would happily go back and stay in any of them based on this experience.,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Stratford-upon-Avon, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicksN1042IA
Kenzi Menara Palace,SLD wrote a review Apr 2017,40,Fantastic Hotel Service,We stayed at Kenzi Menara Palace on a Bed and Breakfast basis and this suited us. We like to get out and try the local eateries of an evening. Lunch evening and pool side food menus and standard at this hotel are adequate.    The staff service was faultless throughout in particular Soukaina (Guest Relations) who ensured that my Partners Birthday was magical arranging a massage as requested that the room was decorated and birthday cake prepared at Breakfast time. Nothing was too much to ask. Sharif also went above and beyond in organising not only a birthday surprise from a friend in the U.K in the form of wine and flowers to our room but also organised a fantastic birthday meal at his recommended restaurant in the old town - Dar Zellij.    Dar Zellij was just magical - The food and alcoholic drinks were fantastic. A real authentic romantic setting and service topped off with a lovely 'Happy Birthday' rendition (again arranged by Sharif). NB: You should request an escort from Dar Zellij to meet you at the taxi drop off point when making a booking it's quite difficult to find and taxis cannot get down the narrow alleys. I'm sure there are many more places just like this one to pre-plan and explore.    As a recommendation to the hotel the Wifi wasn't particularly great intermittent at best. The hotel could also benefit from regular poolside beverage service we didn't mind going to the bar for our drinks but it would definitely be an extra beneficial touch.    Sadly the Souks and main centre attractions seem to have lost much of their authenticity however still worth a visit.    We are not ones to revisit places but for a long weekend of sun fantastic service at this particular hotel and options to eat out at some great Riad venues on the evening throughly recommended.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SLD060585

However we were absolutely stunned at the brilliant customer service we received!  Every single staff member was happy to see us and always willing to make time to talk to us. As well as this the hotel was immaculate beautifully clean and spacious with lovely well kept garden areas within the hotel grounds. The rooms were massive cleaned every day and were kept to a 5* standard also with so much space to move around and not feel claustrophobic.  The food was delicious we were all inclusive and I would highly recommend! Everyday had different exotic foods to try as well as the general foods such as pasta and bread.  I honestly couldn't put a bad word to this hotel we were slightly apprehensive as usually we go to a beach resort to feel some freedom from the hotel however there was no need for the beach here the pool was enormous many sunbeds and lots of space to walk around with high security for our safety.

From the minute we arrived this hotel made us feel so welcome! We arrived late in the evening and although we were late and had not yet checked in Salma on reception made sure we had dinner before they closed the restaurant. The food in the main buffet restaurant was delicious! The staff were attentive and made sure we had plenty of wine and water for everyone. We booked the all inclusive package which was fantastic value! The red and Rose wines are much better than the white wine and all soft drinks are included too.  The cocktails at the bar were delicious and I would disagree with some of the reviews about the all inclusive drinks being limited! We found there was lots of choice and the staff would make us something that we liked that was included.  The poolside entertainment was great! We did Zumba and water aerobics! Amine was a particular favourite! He was great and made us all laugh!  Another special mention was Rajae. She was just so helpful and made sure we were happy throughout our stay!  We were only here for 3 nights and yet we knew most of the staff by the time we left!  The hotel is professional of a very high standard the rooms are very nice and it's the little touches that makes this place so special!

Unfortunately on the first night the air con was not working so we had a bad nights sleep. However I discussed this with the reception the following day and we were able to move rooms. The hotel was extremely clean and serviced daily. The minibar had beer and soft drinks included in the deal. It would have been nice to have wine as an alternative to beer but not a big deal. The food was good with a reasonable choice at the buffet. The service could have been a little better but the staff were always busy so we didn't mind to much.    The kids spent most of the time in the smaller pool outside. The pool bar and cafe was nice and having pancake and cakes at 5pm was a nice idea which the kids loved. The staff working behind the bar could have been a little more friendly but again no biggy as they were obviously quite stretched. Amine the entertainment manager was fantastic. We enjoyed his music entertainment and his daily aquazumba sessions. The kids adored him especially my daughter! He also organised group activities such as table tennis matches and water polo. In the evening he and Ilham organised a daily kids disco which was really lovely. Ilham was also great with the kids when they fancied going to kids club.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Juls022 wrote a review Apr 2017,40,Good hotel away from busy centre with large pool,We stayed at Kenzi Menara Palace for 4 nights in April and enjoyed our stay overall.  Some of the good points:  - large swimming pool and no e surroundings and gardens  - spacious rooms with plenty of storage and nice bathrooms  -Excellent breakfast with good choice of food. Omelettes cooked at request and traditional pancakes  -Location was perfect for us only 15 minutes drive away from city centre which is really polluted and dirty so we were glad we didn't stay in a riad. 20 minutes away to the airport . Free Shuttles available from hotel so that was convenient to go to Medina every night we came back by taxi which was around 100-150 dirhams. Supermarket nearby around 15 minutes walk so that was handy and we went there once    Some of the negative points:  - pool bar was very expensive cocktails at London prices and bar was quite dirty non hygienic  - staff were ok reception staff were friendly however waiting staff didn't speak much English we felt it was more catered towards french and noone came to our table during breakfast to offer tea and coffee only after we asked they did it as if doing us a favour  - coffee at breakfast was terrible - non-drinkable so we ended up having tea or juice. Birds at breakfast are a problem disturbing guests even indoors and can be a danger to food contamination. This needs to be looked at by management urgently  - didn't offer iron or ironing board in the room When requested offered ironing service at a charge for 70 dirhams per item we felt this was too much !  - water offered in tiny bottles ...    Overall we had a good stay and had a great time in Marrakesh weather was superb and highlight of our trip was a sunset camel ride with a visit to Berber village so would highly recommend.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Jo M wrote a review Apr 2017,20,Disappointing!,My husband and I stayed here for a long weekend to celebrate his birthday. We'd had it booked for a very long time and were very excited. Unfortunately it turned out to be one disappointment after another.    First impressions of the hotel on arrival were ok. It looked nice and had a good atmosphere. We were kept hanging around for ages in the reception area waiting to be shown to our room (at least half an hour). When we finally got to our room it looked nice not overly spacious but fine for just the 2 of us. We had booked a garden view so we weren't very happy to find that it was a garden/car park view. It wasn't the end of the world and after a long day of travelling etc we decided to just let it go. We made it downstairs in time for our evening meal. Food was pretty good.    On our first full day we went down for breakfast it was pretty meh....nothing to get excited about. We went to the poolside after and just as we sat down to relax we heard an awful noise from over the wall. Apparently there was a racing car event going on that weekend that we had not been made aware of at the time of booking. It was literally on the other side of the wall. At no point did the hotel or the travel company we booked with get in touch to warn us of this and give us the opportunity to change our dates. The noise was unbearable. It was certainly not the peaceful holiday that we'd planned. This went on for 2 whole days.    This is advertised as all inclusive.....it is not. Drinks included are very limited and not very drinkable. You want something better you pay for it. We've been on many all inclusive holidays and never encountered this problem before.    My husband and I both had bad tummies and spent the last 2 days of the holiday in our room and not venturing far from the toilet. I'm guessing it's from the BIRDS that fly freely around the inside dining area that land on the food and eat off the serving spoons......    All in all this was a very poor holiday. It certainly wasn't the 5 star luxury that we'd imagined it would be.

For those of you who enjoy Studio Cycling there are two 'spin' bikes. Do not bring your cycling shoes as no cleats! The most impressive thing was the staff. They were polite friendly and always willing to help. The pool bar team helped me polish up my French (much to their amusement!) whilst Cherif (who is well documented in the reviews) was indeed a Mr Fixit. We look forward to returning in the future.,Date of stay: February 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bromley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keithg32017
Kenzi Menara Palace,TravelguyBudapest wrote a review Apr 2017,50,"Nice, relaxing stay",Our third time in this beautiful hotel and for sure not the last one! Nice rooms very nice relaxed moroccan atmosphere and decoration in the hotel. Food is excellent especially the moroccan kitchen. Although we are always cautious with salad and water. We choosed all inclusive in our stay so we didn't have to worry about it. Friendly and helpful staff at the reception (they help you plan your trips) and very nice people at the restaurants at the swimming pools and the kids club staff is fantastic! Thank you Salah for the tennis lessons for our kids! Thank you Amin and Bezmi(the smiling girl) for the programs for the kids: baby disco pizza making and treasure hunt it was fun!  The big pool is not heated so you can use it only when it's very hot but the smaller pool is heated (unfortunately on our first day it was cold but when we asked a manager to do something about it the next day it was a nice temperature😀).  The bathroom at the poolside needs more cleaning and also the tables outside at the swimming pools.  The staff is friendly and with some tip and a smile they are really motivated to make your stay a pleasure.  Overall we had a very nice stay in this hotel.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,Budapest,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelguyBudapest

The air conditioning for the entire hotel broke our first night. This is Africa!! Our room was miserably hot. They did supply us with a fan.    The servers are slow or rude. The location is far from anything and nothing worthwhile to see within walking distance. They do offer a shuttle to the medina.    Meals at the major restaurant are okay in terms of taste. The staff never refills anything if all the food is taken at the buffet. You have to almost beg for water or wine.

Kenzi Menara Palace,David Mortimer wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Wonderful Hotel in Marrakech,Stayed at the Kenzi Menara Palace for 7 days end of March and overall had a fantastic stay! We opted for room and breakfast only however did try out the buffet and the Moroccan restaurant during our stay    The hotel and its gardens are well maintained and kept clean and tidy at all times.  Rooms were spacious and comfortable very large beds (even in the twin room we had) and sizeable bathroom with more than adequate room for storage. The room we had also comprised of a small balcony which overlooked the Agdal Gardens.  Very large central pool at the back of the hotel where there are plenty of sun loungers - all of this overlooking the awe inspiring Atlas mountains! Stunning!    Excellent variety and selection of food at breakfast where you can opt for continental or something cooked (they do fresh spanish/cheese omelettes cooked to order). The 'om ali pudding' is devine (i'd love to know the recipe!?) as is the fresh orange juice!  We found that at times the restaurant got very busy at breakfast and it seemed a little chaotic often it was difficult to get a tea/coffee to the table but we could see that the staff on duty were very busy and rushed off their feet.    The Moroccan restaurant was great food very tasty and live traditional music really added to the atmosphere! Excellent value too.    The Buffet had a great selection of both Moroccan and other international foods however we felt this was a bit on the expensive side for a buffet 700MAD (£55) for 2 inc bottle of wine to share. Despite that the food on offer was all very nice.    We also tried out the spa at the hotel and opted for a hammam with black soap scrub which was amazing! Definitely worth doing as soon as you arrive at the hotel your skin will thank you for it!    The hotel also offers a free shuttle bus which takes you into the centre of Marrkech at designated times and we used this often as we eat out quite a lot. We usually got a taxi back as sometimes it was difficult to find the bus amongst all the other buses/taxi at Jemaa el-fna only costs 50mad during the day or 80mad at night. Its a good 8-10mins to get into town from the hotel would probably take you 45mins to an hour to walk not advisable though!    What really made the hotel was the staff! Very friendly and pleasant every time we passed someone we were acknowledged in some way. We could see they worked very hard and took the time to attend to the guests needs as best as possible.  What I did unfortunately see was how rude and derogatory some of the other guests were and the way they spoke to some of the staff! That was the only rudeness I encountered.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Aberdeen, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mortimer1988

We stayed all-inclusive with first choice the rooms are of a good size with very comfortable bedsand well decorated bathrooms were good size also with his and her sinks and a full size bath. There's a mini bar fridge in the room with beer and soft drinks which is restocked daily and is part of the all inclusive package. Meal times is mainly buffet style and there is always a lot to choose from obviously some of the food is a bit different to what your used to back home but isn't that the point of travelling abroad?? We used the Italian restaurant once during our stay and although the menu was limited the food was excellent and service was greatits a pity more guest didn't use this restaurant we we sat alone which was a shame. The drinks at the hotel we good the beer was mainly San Miguel the local wine was nice and the gin and tonics went down a treat. In summary we had a lovely stay and would come back again the staff all work hard to do what ever they can to help youI've read some reviews that say some staff are rude but in my experience staying here the only rudeness I saw was from guests that talked down to staff and the odd drunken golfer.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bugbrooke, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnbR6232JM
Kenzi Menara Palace,an1342017 wrote a review Mar 2017,40,Great hotel,I have noticed quite a few bad reviews regarding this hotel however my review is more positive. I visited in March with my husband for a 1 week stay. On arrival we were greeted with a warm welcome and our luggage was taken from us so it could be taken to our room. We were actually upgraded to a full suite instead of the room we had originally booked which was a bonus.  The hotel and room both were always kept clean. The food was thoroughly enjoyed by myself and my husband. Yes sometimes they were short staffed and tea in the mornings at breakfast seemed to take long to arrive. But I didn't feel these things made our stay unpleasant. We very much enjoyed ourselves and would definitely recommend to others.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Coventry, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/an1342017

I have been all inclusive three previous times and this is the very best.  The views of the mountains the bustle of the Souks and the hotel service cleanliness and food are extremely welcoming to a veteran traveller as myself. In terms of vfm this hotel and package is just the fantastic.  Rachid in the bar commands extra special mention. Such a great guy.  The front desk staff are equally helpful and the cleaning staff leave you surprises of rose petals and the like.  My fiancé was particularly impressed with the patisserie selection.

Kenzi Menara Palace,annejenkins23 wrote a review Mar 2017,50,Fantastic holiday,We rarely write reviews but we wanted to say what a good holiday we are having at this hotel. Firstly the location is excellent: the hotel is situated outside the city against the backdrop of the Atlas mountains which is absolutely stunning. But the hotel is also not far from the city centre and there is a regular shuttle bus service to the main square.    The accommodation is first class; the rooms are light airy and we'll furnished and ours overlooks the garden with palms and orange trees.There is also a spacious bath/shower room and a separate toilet. The room is cleaned every day to a high standard.    The food is served buffet style. The selection at the buffet changes daily  and offers a variety of Moroccan and European cuisine. At breakfast we recommend the freshly prepared omelettes. At both lunch and dinner the patisserie is formidable. Service is normally good.    All of the staff are courteousobliging and do everything to make you feel comfortable. But Cherif the concierge deserves a special mention for his friendliness diligence and charm.    We have travelled extensively and would highly recommend this hotel. We have already suggested that members of our family return with us later in the year.

Do NOT stay here ... there is not a cat in hells chance this is a four star hotel  much less a 5 star.  We arrived to nobody taking our luggage  our room that was supposedly a garden view was a view of the roadside . The food was inedible  dripping in oil most of the time and full  Of loud golfers. The Italian restaurant was a conference room with red table cloths and a picture on the wall of something Italian .. absolutely horrendous and soulless! The Maroccan restaurant we ordered simple as didn't want to make it difficult for them.. chicken on a skewer with rice . It took an hour and a half and was stone cold .. to top it all there was s local man on a guitar that literally gave us all a headache it was so bad..! The whole restaurant we're laughing .. felt bad for the guy but really? It was a joke . The service is diabolical here  the place is filthy and it was a major dissapointmrct.

The good stuff  Rooms clean and spacious location to travel to the golf courses and city center perfect the beautiful and talented singer in the bar  the grounds of the hotel are pleasant .  Excellent desserts at the buffet.  The bad stuff.  The service is awful. Breakfast service is laughable regular 20 min waits for a coffee if it arrives at all  plates stacked up on the tables as waiters don't clean the tables. Similar at dinner occasionally slightly better . Same thing at the bar sometimes a waiter comes begrudgingly to take an order (things much better when waitresses are working) . Both weeks I was there they ran out of gin and the beer was warm for 2 days.  The food in the hotel is at best average  the Italien and Moroccan restaurant are slow and worse than the buffet .  The hotel has an issue with the room keys every 2 days they stop working  we started to renew the cards daily to avoid walking backwards and forwards.  Non of the 22 people I traveled with said they would return to this hotel  which is a shame as the hotel has potential to be a well priced all inclusive alternative in Marrakech !,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Weidling, Austria",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simonbI7399EK

Kenzi Menara Palace,S K wrote a review Mar 2017,50,Beautiful,I had the pleasure of accompanying a dear friend here for one week and we had the most fabulous time.  The staff are welcoming from the start and very informative. Our twin room was extremely spacious clean and well decorated. The bathroom had a luxurious feel and promised a lovely shower but in this we were slightly disappointed.  Our ground floor patio looked over the beautiful and well kept gardens with not only a pool view but mountains too. It looks like the rooms have an option to connect with a centre double door which we found to be very thin and could hear all of the neighbours goings on!  The pools are both quite chilly on the cooler days as they are not heated but we braved the warmer pool on our hottest day and it was a welcome refreshment.  Food in the main buffet hall is excellent and varied although do not expect a typical full English breakfast they have tried but there is so much choice it really isn't a problem. Tagine is on the menu every night along with many vegetable rice and couscous dishes not to mention the vast array of salads cold meats and breads.  The pool bar was a favourite of ours with the best burger I have ever tasted! With pizzas chips and toasted sandwiches to name a few treats.  We experienced the Italian restaurant which had to be booked even though it was included and were served two delicious dishes along side an extensive self serve salad bar.  Other facilities include on site ATM along with the in house currency exchange internet and printer access two gift shops one of which was well equipped with toiletries etc. and the other we found out was the cheapest place to buy argan oil! Our change was given in €'s.  On use of the gym we noticed that only one tread mill was working which caused a bit of a cue and this was directly in the sun.  Some thing to remember to take with you is tissue as most public loos ran out.  There is a form to fill out on arrival and again on departure of the airport so remember a pen and fill it out in the cue! We were only searched on our departing journey past security and were shocked at the very hands on approach so ladies be prepared to feel a little violated.  On visiting the souks we had a couple with a pram in the group and felt they struggled on the pathways and down the busy small streets as many mopeds would pass in such a small space constantly which made it dangerous so carry baby if you can.  The staff including Cherif Jelleli Asam and Amine looked after us so very well and helped us with transport directions etc. and they taught us so much about their culture and language which made our visit so special.  All in all you will not be disappointed with this hotel as long as you visit this country to absorb its culture people and food.

The hotel is lovely but everything else was a massive disappointment.  Starting with breakfast not always hit and the standard wasn't very good. Had omelette and toast every morning as that was the edible food available even though the omelette wasn't cooked through properly.  Lunch I the pool bar was better but the attitude of the staff spoilt it they were very lazy and got most of the orders wrong. The chairs were also covered in bird poo which was never cleaned.  Evening meal was diabolical. Mostly cold no taste and definitely not edible. Does the chef not taste the meals before it is served?? We paid extra to eat in the Italian one night which was better but not by much.  The evening entertainment was laughable the resident singer had a repertoire of around 4 songs which she did when she felt like it spent most of the time on her phone!! No other entertainment available except the guys trying to play string instruments which hurt your ears  Would not recommend or return.

The all inclusive deal has a very limited drinks menu to chose from all cocktails taste sirupy and over sweet . The main buffet restaurant was not great...A couple of highlights the chicken and lemon tagine the outdoor lunch BBQ and chocolate domes with dark chocolate mousse. Lows the breakfast was very poor.. weak coffee cold scrambled eggs and stale bread rolls(actually these were always stale). The only thing I found palatable in the mornings were the omelettes cooked to order.Birds freely pecking on the puddings at lunch on the 1st day not a great start!  The shuttle service to the Medina is good but not frequent enough.  The room was large with a good comfortable bed. The chamber maids were excellent and we got Rose petals in the bathroom on the last day.I had a great massage in the spa- ask for Nora. The Hammam was great.. very invigorating.  Ali (the restaurant manager?) was lovely. Do not spend an extra 100 mad to eat at Souasanne it was terrible and more granny chic than Moroccan .  Would I go again? Tempting on some levels but no all in all most of the staff were pleasant and it was clean and calm but I think if we visit Marrakech again we would rather do the traditional Riad experience instead of a big homogenous hotel complex.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elizael
Kenzi Menara Palace,Paul5477 wrote a review Mar 2017,50,Lovely,"We booked this hotel as a fairly late deal to get away for a week and have some sun. This hotel was the more expensive out of the three options that we had but on reflection we definitely made the correct choice. Arrival at the airport was dogged by very slow passport control and I now know how non EU people must feel when they land in the UK. On leaving the airport and heading to your tour bus or taxi be mindful of the locusts that approach you trying to help you with your bags and suitcases all they want is their palms crossing with a bit of dollar and they are best to be avoided.  Our journey to the hotel was around twenty five minutes and this included a drop at another Thompson hotel first.  On arrival through the entrance complete with electronic barrier first impressions were indeed vey good although the Union Flag was flying upside down next to the multitude of others that were on the masts. Check in was swift and efficient and the reception area was immaculate and looked very classy. I've never treated myself to all inclusive before so getting the all important blue wristband gave me that feeling of euphoria as I now had ""access to all areas""  I was not allowed to wheel my suitcase from reception it was whisked away by a smart Moroccan bellboy and I was hot on his heels to the room on the ground floor.  Our room was vast plenty of space dressing gowns smart tv fridge with free drinks and oodles of wardrobe space. The hangers however were the ""anti-theft"" ones and if I had one grumble I could say that they were short in supply.  I had booked a double room and my chin hit the floor when I saw it was set out as a twin. How was my romantic getaway going to cope with being more than an arms length from my sweetheart and night time cuddle buddy? One quick word with reception was all it took and the matter was sorted. I now felt like the hippo and little chick in the Silent Night advert and was very content.  We were given a typed sheet of paper that listed the times that all the respective restaurants were open and should you wish to be a belly buster you van literally graze from breakfast then lunch followed by snacks at the pool bar and then of course your evening meal which can either be taken in the main restaurant or you can book to eat in the Italian restaurant should you so wish. If you want to eat in the Moroccan restaurant again you have to book but even if you are all inclusive you are asked to pay 100dam each for some reason.  Eating at the Italian restaurant was very nice a good choice but no pizza which I found odd but I wouldn't want to eat pizza on holiday to be fair. Service again was excellent attentive staff but I could have done without the violin player waltzing around the tables all night but that's just not my thing.  Food in the main restaurant is excellent. Clean food areas presentation is delightful and there is plenty of choice each night although it is repetitive every couple of days. I would say that there is enough food choice for everyone's taste. You should know that with the doors of the restaurant being open during the day there is an influx of sparrows that come in and ""mop up"" any crumbs left on the tables during the daytime so if you don't like our feathered friends or have a dislike for feathers then at least you are forewarned and should maybe sit towards the back of the room and away from the doorways.  Outside the pool area is excellent. Two pools and ample towels loungers and bedded areas that you can relax in. I can't comment on the spa or the gym as I do my running at home and indulge in self massage only but if the rest of the hotel is anything to go by I'm sure it will be high quality.  There is a free shuttle bus into the city each day which is a fifteen minute journey book at the concierge and get a window seat to marvel at the slalom skills of the locals on their mopeds that clearly haven't seen an MOT since the day of manufacture.  I would highly recommend this hotel its been a great stay and it had everything that I wanted out of a week in the sun.",Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Barrow upon Humber, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paul5477

We booked 2 private tours with the concierge which were both good value and worth doing. It was a bit chilly to use the outdoor pools but both looked very inviting! Our room was a very good size but a bit of a distance from the bars/restaurants. The food was great with good choices for veggies and fussy eaters (we've got both in our family!). The hotel is spotless and is being cleaned constantly but I didn't like the birds which get into the restaurant area - not sure how they can be controlled tho?! Alcoholic drinks are good. The spa pool was ok a bit dated but good for a rainy afternoon!

Kenzi Menara Palace,Wendy Stone wrote a review Mar 2017,50,Three generation family holiday,We spent a week here and had a wonderful time. Rooms were clean large and well equipped ( we had two family rooms interconnecting). The best feature of this hotel is the very attentive and friendly staff. Shareef ( spelling?) of course with his wonderful English and ability to fix anything. Barman Hassan Yassine who fixes a mean Vodka Stinger and can sing too  waiter Rochdi who brought us endless coffee and beer Racha and Amine who just want to make sure that all is well Bezma and colleagues in the Kids Club and last but not least Fatima  the lovely cleaner whom we frequently met in the cloakroom and who helped me out with Daisy and her hand washing! Ok I will admit there was one bar steward at the pool side who wasn't quite so chirpy. Food was great a good variety and often Moroccan. Yes the large pool is very cold but the small pool is just right. The all inclusive is a great deal...I don't think any ' all inclusive' offers will give you the top quality spirits who cares? Stick to the local stuff.,Date of stay: February 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/727wendym

Kenzi Menara Palace,Aimee L wrote a review Mar 2017,10,DON'T IGNORE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS,"We did and it was a huge mistake. My husband and I stayed for 3 nights in March we wouldn't have stayed a day longer. Had it not been so hot and sunny we would have flown home earlier. Definitely not 5* and definitely not all inclusive.    Room: A good size. Large bed and blackout curtains. Air con was good. Wifi was reasonable and there was a smart TV. It was clean however it was very tatty. The seal on the side of the shower had worn away so the floor flooded every time we used it. The seal on the edge of the bath was also coming away and just looked a bit grotty. Certainly not the 5* standard we were expecting. Also things like the toilet paper felt very cheap and the kettle lid didn't shut properly. All things that can be easily fixed or upgraded yet have just been ignored.    Food and drink: We had the ""all inclusive"" package. It was certainly not all inclusive. When we arrived and saw the well stocked bar we were very excited. However we were then given a tiny little menu with a few ""cocktails"" and very basic cheap and nasty spirits and wines to chose from and were told that if we wanted any of the branded spirits we would have to pay for them. Throughout the stay we tried a cocktail a wine and the gin and vodka and it was like paint stripper. We wasted more than we drank. The food was also awful. The same thing every day and none of it was good quality. I don't understand how you can get even something like pesto pasta so wrong. The tables in the dining room were never set up properly. We were constantly asking for cutlery and a lot of the time they hadn't been cleaned down. It wasn't particularly busy so there was no excuse for the state of it. There were 2 restaurants in the hotel but again you had to pay to eat in them and judging by the quality of the other food the hotel provided you'd be better going into town. I had a burger at the pool bar one afternoon because I was just so hungry and it was awful. The quality doesn't even come close to a chain restaurant in England. It's frustrating because all of this could be so easily fixed just by upgrading the quality of the alcohol. None of this felt 5* and when you go all inclusive you expect everything to be included.    Staff: I have never felt so uncomfortable. The staff felt so hostile and aggressive especially at the pool bar. Asking for a drink felt like you were asking for the world. The dining room as well. There were a few exceptions the concierge was very friendly as were the maids. The driver of the shuttle bus into town was also lovely.    Pool: The pool was a good size and probably the nicest part of the stay. Plenty of loungers and towels. However the water was very cold had it not been so hot and sunny there would have no way you could have used it.    Spa and gym: We had a free pass to the thermal pool and hammam. The hammam was okay but the thermal pool was not thermal. I had a body scrub and a massage which were good however again it was just small things such as the changing rooms being tatty and the music stopping and starting that let it down. The gym had the basic equipment and was empty which was nice.    Overall a very disappointing stay. Not 5* luxury more 3* basic. Had the staff been kinder and welcoming the entire experience could have been better.",Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aimeel810
Kenzi Menara Palace,Usama wrote a review Mar 2017,20,Disappointing place to stay,I selected this place based on a description showing it as a five star hotel . Photos posted complimented the write up . Upon arrival I realized that most if not all what was posted about the hotel was incorrect if not false. This is not a five star hotel at all. The furniture  the facility in general and everything that could make your stay enjoyable. They seem to be set up for handling chartered groups and I would reluctantly state that . The place is in the landing path of jets descending to the airport close by and the most annoying is that they do not have air conditioning this time of the year and if you bring that to the front desk attention they direct you to keep windows open regardless of the street noise.  I would not recommend this place.,Date of stay: March 2017,,"Mohammedia, Morocco",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/umansouri
Kenzi Menara Palace,Simon J wrote a review Mar 2017,50,Wonderful experience,We stayed at this hotel and we so much enjoyed staying there. When you step inside the hotel you are welcomed by very polite and kind staff and a pleasant smell of jasmine. People at the reception desk are very friendly. We were given a spacious family suite with two toilets and a bathtub plus a shower. A large living room and balcony was there as well. The room had a pleasant smell and a huge balcony with pool view. We would like to thank Mr. Cherif for being so friendly and kind. Unfortunately we had a bad luck and our son had to stay in the hospital for a few days. Mr. Cherif brought him sandwiches flowers and juices. He asked how he was doing and when my son came back to the hotel he helped us by arranging trips to  Marrakech and Atlas Mountains. He always had a smile on his face.    Breakfast was incredible. A huge variety of foods and a pleasant dining room.    We visited the Moroccan restaurant and enjoyed it very much with its traditional Moroccan dishes and live music.

Kenzi Menara Palace,LondonFarhad wrote a review Mar 2017,50,Outstanding Hotel and Wonderful staff,We just returned from The Kenzi Menara Palace Hotel and we just wanted to leave this feedback to everyone who visits Marrakech this is the place to stay. We can't get over how wonderful this Hotel is the rooms were very big and very clean large grounds and. Staff just fantastic all happy and enthusiastic made our stay extra special. We were a group of 6 lads and had a great time. And we will definitely come back thank you to Rahja Besma and Salma and Cherif and all the other staff. The food is excellent we had an all inclusive and I must say it's worth every penny. Best thing is all the drinks and even the mini bar was included. This is better then 5 stars don't listen to anyone else. Try it your self only disappointment was the Taxi from the airport charged us 200dhs and it was 100dhs on the way back. That's not the hotels fault they do have a shuttle bus which is free and this also takes you to the Medina souks several times a day.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LondonFarhad
Kenzi Menara Palace,Fes A wrote a review Mar 2017,50,Absolutely fantastic.. World class customer service.,I booked this hotel for my wife's birthday from the initial pictures I saw online I was optimistic about how our stay but as soon as we arrived we were taken aback.    When we got off the coach the staff were waiting to carry our bags and were very welcoming.    The hotel is immaculate the rooms are very spacious with all the high spec facilities the fridge is always stocked up with drinks the floor is always gleaming and the smell in the room and in the hallways is just beautiful.    During our stay the concierge (SHERRIF) was fantastic always smiling and asking us about our stay and going beyond his duties to help he organised everything for us from quad biking to camel riding to a spa day and also just giving us advice about where shop or the best places to visit. I guess it's just in his nature to be this kind of person so bubbly and very very helpful.  This man deserves a massive pay rise.    I also have to give a mention to the food & beverage manager (MOHAMED MOUSAID) he was constantly asking us about the food and service the food wasn't to our taste so we mentioned this to Mohamed and what he did for the rest of our stay was incredible he asked us to write down what we wanted to eat each night and the head chef would make it for us this gesture in my eyes was heart warming. The food was amazing and the best thing about it it was fresh. On our last morning he sent us a special breakfast straight to our room.  World class customer service again.    Finally the head of entertainment (LOAEY KASBI) made us feel like we were part of his family from playing table tennis with me to joining us for breakfast to taking us to the mosque (in his own time).  A truly brilliant person.    This hotel is classed as a 4/4.5 star but in our opinion it is 100% a 5 star.    We had a brilliant stay throughout and will definitely recommend to everyone think of staying here.    I will be staying again.,Date of stay: February 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bradford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fesa2018

Kenzi Menara Palace,JennyWenny29 wrote a review Feb 2017,50,A quick 5 days away in the sun,Had a really good time in this hotel just flew over for 5 days for a bit of winter sun. It's out of the medina but close enough to get cabs to any of the sights all I wanted was to read a book by a pool and eat some nice food. We went all inclusive and the food was lovely lots of fresh salads and tasty tagines. Met a young guy called Amine who had recently started there and was keen to improve his English so he hung out with us a bit (joined us for meals) and was really lovely company it was great really as if we couldn't get a waiters attention he would get us what we wanted. He was head of 'animation' but because we don't want to learn to dance or do activities (there weren't many like a Spanish family hotel...thankfully) I think he's there to offer the service if you want it but in a nice relaxed low key way. It may be different in summer but everything was just chilled. A great hotel if u just want to relax by a pool and not be hassled or annoyed all the staff there are lovely I think Cherif and Amine were the most friendly and helpful.,Date of stay: February 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Doncaster, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JennyWenny29

Kenzi Menara Palace,loobyloo2000 wrote a review Feb 2017,40,Enjoyable stay,We stayed here with friends for a week of golf and relaxation on an inclusive package. There are lots of good things about the hotel and a few negatives - though these may just be a Moroccan thing. First the good - customer relations was excellent and in particular Rajae made us feel very welcome. In fact there appear to be quite a few suited people going around being very welcoming and making sure everything is alright. The hotel is tastefully furnished and feels very Moroccan and comfortable. The food offering was good with plenty of choice in the buffet and freshly cooked food always available for breakfast lunch and dinner. Our room was spacious and also comfortable. Rooms are arranged in a series of Riads. Unfortunately the week we were in Morocco was unseasonably cold and this meant the hotel was also very cold in particular the main reception area and bar as well as the open air corridors to the bedrooms. It also meant we couldn't really enjoy the pool bar. Service in the restaurants was sometimes a bit hit and miss with insufficient staff to replace things like knives and forks and cups and saucers. We also sometimes had quite long waits to get wine. Also although the food was very good plates provided were always cold. There seemed no concept of providing warm plates. I thought this was odd but maybe a Moroccan thing. We tried the other two restaurants. The Italian was good but we didn't really enjoy the Moroccan one. There was very little choice on the menu and the knuckle of lamb with the cous cous was one of the worst things I've ever been served in a restaurant. My friends who chose the alternative chicken dish said that was OK. All in all we had an enjoyable stay and I would recommend this hotel if you are coming to Marrakech particularly on a golfing break. If I was just coming to Marrakech for a short city break I would stay nearer the Medina.,Date of stay: February 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,West Sussex,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loobyloo2000

Kenzi Menara Palace,Jacque F wrote a review Feb 2017,50,Relaxing location and atmosphere,We have holidayed in Morocco quite a few times and often at this time of year so can fairly compare this holiday and hotel.  Having decided to have a suite this made the holiday better than ever. This paid dividends when a day of rain followed by a sand storm gave us the space to actually enjoy even these days. Good restaurant without excessive amounts of food on display but regular fresh top-ups to match demand. Suite mini-bar filled up properly with more than enough for a day or two.  No piped muzac around the pool and bar areas was very pleasant. The lack of formal activities was exceedingly welcome. Both of these made the hotel very relaxing and staff were very good at responding to requests. Customer relations staff are pro-active approaching guests to ask after their views and experiences and not only available should something be amiss.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Kimicha C wrote a review Feb 2017,50,Wonderful hotel,First time in Marrakech and it exceeded all expectations. The hotel is beautiful huge and smells amazing (they sell the scent of the hotel in the gift shop)...the staff are fabulous and go above and beyond to make your stay even more special (shout out to Cherif at the concierge Ali at the restaurant and Noelle at the pool bar)    Food - We stayed at an all inclusive basis and found a good variety at breakfast lunch and dinner. There are chefs that cook fresh food to order as well as the buffet & the snacks at the pool bar are delicious.    Location - Good location only a 10-15 minute drive to the airport (between 100-200 Dirham if you haggle) Also a short drive to the Souks main square desert and camel riding. The hotel offers a free and frequent shuttle bus to and from the main square.    Rooms - The rooms are spacious and modern with Moroccan interiors and have nice balconies. Comfy beds and lovely pillows. The maids did a really good job of cleaning and refreshing the minibar with drinks each day. Also good to know in the all inclusive you get free room service between 12am-6am which is a nice touch.    Things to do - Within the hotel there is a spa gym indoor pool table tennis tables 2 outdoor pools overlooking the Atlas Mountains small gift shops and an indoor and outdoor bar. The concierge have leaflets with well priced excursions out of the hotel e.g. Quad biking Camel riding desert experiences and hot air balloon rides etc. There are also taxis that are willing to drive you around to see the city for a few hours for good prices when haggled with.    Pool - There is one huge outdoor pool with a beautiful view of the Atlas Mountains and a smaller heated outdoor pool. There were plenty of comfortably sun beds and the staff around the pool were really helpful with putting up umbrellas and moving sun beds to face the sun etc.    Overall we had a pretty perfect experience here and will defiantly be returning.,Date of stay: February 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimichac

Kenzi Menara Palace,HomsieP wrote a review Feb 2017,40,Great 4 day family break (who are well travelled) from the UK,A great hotel and break from start to finish (perhaps the only down side was an extra day wouldn't have gone a miss as 4 full days would have been ample).    To justify the 'well travelled' comment is because we as a family have had many holidays over the years in many countries which hopefully helps in providing a rounded review and comparison.    Myself and my wife are early 40's and we have two girls aged 5 and 9. Our requirement for the short break was somewhere which was warm in February and not more than 3-4 hours travel from the UK. Plus had a good balance of a nice 4-5 * hotel with kids facilities and we could incorporate some of the culture and sight-seeing all within a reasonable budget – so Marrakech ticked all the boxes.    And now for my review !!    Pre travel : Given the short trip I wanted to maximize our time/plan so had many questions ahead of our trip. A month prior I started emailing these through to the hotel and they were excellent in answering every question. Rajae from guest relations was very good.    Checkin : We arrived at the hotel late evening and were greeted by front door and reception. Check-in was easy enough and got a good explanation of the key info for the hotel. We went too room dropped bags and went to the main buffet for a quick bite. Hotel was 30-40% occupied given season which was ideal without having any hustle and bustle.    Hotel room : We had a family suite facing front of the hotel.. Best suite we have ever had and at 110sqm more than ample room. 2 sizable balconies and the kids had their own fixed single beds. The décor was a tad outdated but nothing significant. Plus being all inclusive the in bar had a mixture of water/drinks and beer which were replenished daily.    Gym/Spa/Indoor pool : Nice gym with modern equipment and free to use. Ample indoor pool but only usable by children in the morning and chargeable to adults unless using SPA. Good SPA facilities with a good range of treatments at hotel prices.    Hotel Facilities : The hotel is fairly vast with large grounds i.e sits of the main road and surrounded by nice gardens all round. More than adequate facilities (low occupancy helped) and if the weather was better we could have made use of the outdoor activities. Evening entertainment was limited to the main bar area but again for a short break wasn’t an issue.    Kids stuff : We didn’t try the kids club but generally they were occupied well even with limited use of the indoor pool and outdoor being to cold.. May have been a different case if we had stayed longer but imagine in busy seasons the entertainment would change accordingly    Food : We were all inclusive but for me average in comparison to many other hotels I have visited. Plus I am limited being a vegetarian. The buffet could have had more main choices and be labelled so it was clear what every dish was. Breakfast was good with fresh omelettes tailor made - service from staff was adequate. The Italian ala carte is worth a visit. The main bar and drinks areas round the pool which also served snacks were good.    Location : 10 minutes from airport (but expect to pay 200 MAD for 4 miles) and a short trip to Medina centre via a free hotel shuttle bus. We visited the centre for best part of a day – great too visit but not everyone cup of tea if you don’t like shopping or being hassled every 2 minutes. We as as a family actually loved it. Not much directly outside of hotel apart from a Carrefour complex about 10 minute walk.    Staff : Everyone was very helpful and always happy to help and delivered on actions – couldn’t ask for any more from any hotel. Big thanks to Mr Sherriff at concierge for arranging to ship our ornament bought at the souk to the UK as it wouldn’t fit in our suitcase.    In summary again a great hotel for our family trip in February and depending on what you are looking for Marrakech is a great location for a short or long term break.,Date of stay: February 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Leicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HomsieP
Kenzi Menara Palace,Wanderer wrote a review Feb 2017,50,BOOK IT!,So i took myself & my mother away on a last minute deal to Marrakech for her birthday & this hotel was on the deal. I reviewed the reviews & they were 50/50 so i took the chance. From my personal experience and i am abit of a snob this hotel is everything. As soon as you arrive the staff are ready to take your bags to your room the scent in the hotel is absolutely luscious. It 100% feels as though you are in Morocco. The staff are amazing my first language is British English & we had no problem communicating. One staff in particular who was a dream called Soukaina was extremely helpful to all our needs & provided us with information around the area. The rooms are very elegant with a balcony. I have attached some images. Would recommend the Hammam ( Moroccan spa treatment) at their in house spa. The hotel also provides a shuttle bus to the Marrakesh markets - quite handy so we didn't have to haggle for taxis. The swimming pool area is a delight over looking the Atlas mountains which are beautiful. They have a large pool and small pool which is warmer ideally for kids. Housekeeping would come in every couple of hours to deliver water bottles FOC which was a nice gesture. Would strongly recommend you to book it!

This is an old-looking traditional but modern hotel catering for all needs.  From the lovely 'ever smiling' Soukaina and the rest of the helpful reception staff the concierge bar staff cleaners and to the catering and waiting staff (I hope I haven't missed anyone) - all are friendly and seem to enjoy their roles thus making your stay more pleasurable and relaxing.  The hotel also provides a free shuttle service into the city centre. Although the walk only takes about 45 mins it is exposed to constant sunshine (remember to wear sunscreen)!

We could not fault the hotel itself. It was sumptuous clean and very well kept. The staff were all very accommodating some were rather formal and others more relaxed but all had very good customer service skills. There was entertainment in the bar and dinning room every night to a good standard. The pool and surrounding gardens and furniture etc were excellent. There was a free minibus service into the heart of the city at regular intervals every day. The rooms were well appointed and very clean. The only issue we had which would stop us from going here again was the food. We are not particularly fussy eaters and will eat any type of food but nothing here that was offered was of a good standard. There was little choice and what there was was poorly cooked and the hot offerings were luke warm at best.

We were also not aware of charges made for the indoor pool in the spa area. I feel this should be clearly stated in hotel information. I found the spa area changing areas to be cold and no soap in the soap dispensers! Having had a few treatments I felt the staff were a bit inexperienced.

Excellent sweet/savory breakfast with freshly baked cakes every day and home made jams of all sorts (kiwi confiture was a total new experience!) fresh omelettes and pancakes of all sorts. Staff is kind and helpful but I wouldn't say the same for management. For a 5 star hotel there is very little space for flexibility and custom-tailored needs. BEWARE! you are not allowed to bring any kind of food or drinks - not even 1 bottle of water - from outside. If you do you will be followed and stopped by staff and your goods confiscated!

Most staff are very friendly and helpful while only very few can be a little distant which is still better than a lot of 5* hotels out there. In my experiences this is an excellent Resort hotel if not perfect food are great drinks are plentiful and fabulous entertainment through out the dinner services and evening bar. The most impressive thing is although it is a super off-peak time for the hotel all the service standards are still maintained extremely well. Two of the paid-for restaurant are more or less left empty as majority opted for the buffet that is included but the food/table presentation and entertainment of the two are still wonderfully arranged as if they were fully booked.

Kenzi Menara Palace,SimondSimmons wrote a review Nov 2016,20,No mint tea on arrival...A sign of things to come,Rooms are great Cherif on the concierge desk was a wonderful ambassador of the hotel and the kindest most helpful person. If he isnt employee of the month every month i'd be amazed.    Pool area is great plenty of beds but not enough to look like a Alicante Sun special holiday resort. The big beds were a welcome addition for later in the day when you just want to chill.    Plenty of other outside seating with sofa's and chairs under a floral canopy.  Pool bar staff were obviously unhappy to be serving. Very slack service. Poor drinks measures which is fine all inclusive but not good when you are paying £3 for a half a plastic beaker of Coke. Food at the pool bar was also borderline awful at times. Burgers that were obviously pre cooked and probably built into a bun before being dropped in a panini toaster to warm!    Breakfast is a busy time! The tables aren’t cleared efficiently which results in diners clearing someone else’s mess to make a table for their family. Luke warm hot water is a knock on effect. Why they don’t have runners to clear tables and bring our boiling water I don’t know but the team were friendly it was a frustrating start to the day though especially if you go around ten am.    They also seem very much focused on all inclusive. This makes them quite aggressive when asking for bills to be signed which is fine except that frequently it too them ten minutes to prepare the bill which is a long wait when you'd rather be sunbathing. It seems that at times were we waiting on the staff.    We did ask for all inclusive and were told 50 euros per day per person. Another guest was charged 25 Euros per day. When i mentioned this at reception they just shrugged it off.    4Euros for milk in the room. Also had to ask every day for tea bags to be left (English and Early Grey) as they didn’t seem to like replenishing them.

Kenzi Menara Palace,soozcalver wrote a review Oct 2016,50,FANTASTIC SHORT BREAK,fter the debacle of the lowcost holidays crash and subsequently booking with an unknown company to get the cheapest deal possible for this hotel I approached the Reception with some trepidation. But not to fear after a few minutes we were checked in our All Inclusive Premium bands attached to our wrists for the duration and our two electronic keycards issued (pity they didn't tell us not to put near to our mobiles as this would render them useless!)    For a hotel that clearly was not full I was a bit aggrieved that we were put in one of the furthest rooms from reception (the hotel is separated into different riads and woe betide if you forget which one you are in we were not the only people wandering around looking for their temporary home). However once in the room there were certainly no complaints. The largest double bed I have ever seen in my life comfortable chair and sofa the bathroom was huge with both bath and shower and best of all a separate toilet complete with bidet. The balcony was spacious and caught the afternoon sun – shame that we were facing the main road but that didn't detract from our enjoyment as it was fun to watch people and donkeys passing by and once the doors were shut we were not disturbed by the traffic noise. We were also delighted to see storks flying to their roosts in the evening. Yes the rooms are starting to look a little bit tired and could do with redecoration but tired does not equal dirty or broken. Also we only had to mention (to the wonderful Cherif) that one of our curtains was broken and a maintenance man was despatched to replace it the same day.    The main pool area was clean and the pool looked inviting until we dipped a toe – not warm enough for our tastes although plenty of guests took advantage of both pools. There appeared to be a few tiles missing in the main pool but I'm sure the maintenance team have this in hand. The pool bar and towel service was great and there were plenty of sunbeds to lounge away the day on.    Now to the food. No complaints at all bar one which I will leave to the end. A good selection at all meals both hot food and salads – in fact I find it hard to believe that anyone could not find something to their taste. Service at the tables was a bit hit and miss and yes glasses/cups/cutlery were being taken from other tables if yours were missing. Some of the waiters did not speak very good English but we nearly always managed to make our needs known. The comments about French speakers getting better service is a bit unfair; obviously if you speak fluent French you are able to make yourself understood better but a smile and a French please or thank you goes a long way.    The only complaint we had – and it could have been a very serious one – is that none of the food was labelled to say it contained nuts or indeed shellfish! My husband has a nut allergy and on our first night inadvertently ate pasta with pesto resulting in a frightening sequence of events where I thought he would end up in hospital. None of the waiters or chefs seemed to understand when I was asking them what food contained nuts. PLEASE BE AWARE OF THIS IF YOU ALSO HAVE A FOOD ALLERGY.    Now for the question -would we stay there again? An resounding YES. It was a fantastic experience staying in Marrakech and the Kenzi Menara Palace in particular. It was a fabulous hotel the staff were always obliging. Great place scrupulously clean fresh towels each day and can only say we'll be back.,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Ipswich, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soozcalver

Kenzi Menara Palace,Ashling K wrote a review Oct 2016,50,Great stay!!,"First of all we got to the hotel and were told that all the hotel was booked out and our room that we booked wasn't available. We spoke to the lady on reception who then requested the manager deal with us they said they would put is up in another hotel which was also 5* for 1 night and then we would return to kenzi menara palace the next day. They obviously knew we weren't happy as we only had 3 days in marrakesh. We got brought over to the other hotel ""hotel cesar and spa resort"" which was lovely aswell but a bit quiet. On our return to kenzi menara palace they offered us complimentary premium all inclusive and a full body massage which was absolutely amazing. We were escorted by the manager to an upgraded pool view suite. The food in the hotel was gorgeous lots of variety in my opinion. I know it got off to a bad start but they totally redeemed themselves and couldn't do enough for us and bent over backwards for us during our stay almost as if we were royalty.

I will start with the plus staff very friendly food very good room very big Jabrane who runs the pool bar very good at his job one of the waiters I think he is the only waiter who knows what his job entails. Rooms very clean.  Now the down side  Not enough spoons side plates salt and pepper pots plastic glasses and crockery many many with chipswaiters are removing plates spoons from other tables to give to your table today their was a conference on and tables were made up how they should be. Waiters giving you cups with no spoon or saucers. Head restaurant manager taking plates etc away and making up tablesthat's not his job I have noticed in numerous occasions waiting staff are talking together instead of doing their job I don't know if their is a problem with cutleryplates glasses etc but waiters should be making tables up fully. Today I reported my bath not working still waiting to get fixed don't get room 107. Some days the cleaners forget about your hand towels and they only give you one toilet roll which is the thin cheap stuff this is not a 5 * hotel more like a 3.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Pat_The_George_Mere wrote a review Oct 2016,40,Good up to a point...,Stayed for a week at the end of September being of October. The staff were reasonably efficient. Most spoke English but clearly it would have made our stay much easier if we had 'bothered to learn more French'!. The location was very good. In the new part of the city. Well served with Taxis and the like. Very well kept gardens and clean public areas. The guys at the pool bar restaurant all worked hard if quite stressed at times.  The food was good fresh and tasty. Predominately directed to local and southern European tastes but good quality never-the-less. The restaurant stayed open until 11 pm which was great if you arrived on a late flight or had been out for the evening; but not opening until 8 pm was a little frustrating - to a Northern European/English family. That said there was usually something to eat somewhere.  English speaking customers are definitely in the minority at the moment. The staff seem disappointed to having to speak anything other than formal French or relaxed Arabic. On the whole service was 'relaxed'. Nothing was hurried. It wasn't uncommon to be kept waiting for drinks; food orders; money exchange and other services. One exception was Mr. Shari-eff on the concierge desk. His English was a surprising combination London and Birmingham accents. He clearly understood British mentality but quite rightly focused on the large groups rather us three.  The main piece of advice is: keep you electronic door key card away from your mobile phone. The number of times we had to return to reception to have keys replaced we lost count of. It seemed a long way from the top floor of one of the distant blocks.  We run a small hotel back in England and there are certain levels that we try to maintain: lights working in all sections of the room. especially the bathroom and dressing areas - spot lamp bulbs are easy to replaced. Tea and coffee stocks need to be replaced every day.    Overall: good; but not great. Would we return to Marrakech? Yes!

Kenzi Menara Palace,lizziemc929 wrote a review Oct 2016,20,At hotel now and very disappointed,Hotel grounds are nice and staying in a 2 bedroom suite which is lovely.    Staff seem to not have any urgency at all for anything-waiting for a drink for ages. Room service restock tea/coffee and the minibar and have to ring numerous times and each day to get them restocked-if you see it's empty refill it. No hot water as well in the bathrooms and took a while for engineer to come and I'm sitting here with shampoo in my hair.    Food buffet is not very good if a bit of a picky eater-always rice and some sort of potato and a chicken and meat (beef or lamb) and a fish dish. The cheeses are nice but no pasta bar at dinner -I have travelled numerous countries and stayed in many hotels and there is always a pasta bar in the section that in the morning does omelettes. Room service is only free from midnight to 6am.    On a plus side the pool area is lovely and the sunloungers are comfortable and the pool staff are polite and helpful. From 3-5 they do a small menu of sandwiches/a burger and ice cream which is lovely and my favourite meal of the day but is average not fantastic.    I'm glad I'm only here for a week as at the moment if it was any longer I would seriously be thinking of leaving early and moving to another hotel. For the price I've paid for 3 of us for a week-3000 euros I'm seriously not impressed and wished I had gone to a Caribbean resort instead.,Date of stay: October 2016,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizziemc929

Kenzi Menara Palace,Eugiebabe wrote a review Oct 2016,40,Would definitely stay here again,I bought a small group of people here for a health retreat and it was very impressive form the moment I walked in. The staff are friendly the pool area was impressive and lobby area smelled divine! My room was huge. I felt like I was in an apartment. It had some nice touches such as dressing gown and slippers but I would expect that from a 5 star hotel I like that the toilet was separate but still in the bathroom. I was on the ground floor and had a huge patio which lead out onto a grassy area. I realised I had a much bigger space than if I had a balcony and it was nice to sit out there and work.  As I said this was a health retreat but I have to mention the desserts. I was told that they had the African sous chef champion working for them and the desserts looked unbelievable. The food as a whole was ok. I was getting a little tired of it but there is an italian and a Moroccan restaurant to try. The gym area was good. There's a separate studio. The Spa looked good too but I didn't try it. I felt it was too expensive and to pay for use of the indoor pool seemed foolish as there was 2 wonderful outdoor pools. I had a problem with being overcharged but I think that was more to do with Expedia than the hotel. The area looks a bit barren but there was a good explanation for this. The King doesn't want any buildings on the land opposite so no one can see into the palace! We walked for about an hour down to Menara Mall (remember it was a health retreat!) The road is long and straight which means you can't get lost. There is a free shuttle bus to the square which takes 10 mins. We did some good excursions and I have to recommend Ahmed Oumassoud from Ma-Navette.com as the perfect driver and guide. If you want to book him request him or in box me and I will put you in touch. In conclusion a great hotel great staff would recommend and I loved that it looked very traditional and not contemporary.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Ilford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eugiebabe
Kenzi Menara Palace,Richy64 wrote a review Oct 2016,50,A Great Honeymoon in September 16,This review takes into account price paid and personal preference and the time of year.(September).  Overall all area's were clean and the entrance both inside and outside were impressive.  Check in was efficient for our all inclusive staff booked via expedia.  The staff overall were very efficient especially if you are not in a rush after all I was on holiday.  During September the hotel was not busy and lots of staff to cater for your needs.  Whilst I did tip a little it did not feel compulsory but was welcomed by staff.  One big and one pool area which were spacious with plenty of sun beds.  Don't stay here if you want Animation teams and noise but for a relaxing time its perfect around the pool - No noise was bliss. Towels were provided by courteous pool staff.  Pool bar was good and you ordered food of a limited menu there rather than the normal all-inclusive buffet.  Room was large and spacious with double his and her sinks and separate toilet and individual shower and bath.  Large TV all inclusive mini bar and safe included in price.  The staff from Management downwards all appeared to take pride in there jobs and noticeably pleased when senior Management spoke to them.  If you spoke French it would help but I did not feel a second class customer and think this is down to attitude in both directions.  Free shuttle bus into Marrakesh was useful.  Food was not the normal pile it high all inclusive but was overall good unless you live on Meat as this part of the range was somewhat limited. The cakes / sweets were very good though.  Violinist in restaurant added to our dining experience he was great.  The music entertainment in the bar area was Great for the first 6 nights but were disappointing for the last 4 nights (something was going on with their dynamics)  Wi-Fi was OK for normal browsing in my room and public area's.  The hotel was used for conference delegates during our stay but this enhanced our holiday.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Richy64

The tea/coffee tray was very spartan there was no TV guide no information about the hotel or about Marrakech and bathroom provisions were minimal. Facilities management is poor.    The food in the main buffet restaurant wasn't bad with a good selection. Again poor management meant that you may need to ask for cutlery and glassware. there was no one apparently in charge.

Kenzi Menara Palace,andy320clk wrote a review Sep 2016,40,"Nice Wedding Anniversary short break, would recommend the Kenzi Menara Palace",Just got back from a 3 night 4 day breakfor our 1st Wedding Anniversary. We arrived Saturday 24th Sept at about 8pm and check in was very quick & we were in our room in no time at all! We booked a Luxury deluxe double garden view on all inclusive basis. We were very pleasantly surprised by the size of the room. It was more like a suite with a big bathroom with a bath separate shower & loo with bidet. There was also a separate WC as well which was good. The bedroom was huge with an lcd tv and there was a huge lounge like area too with ample seating areas and there was two balconies one was more enclosed than the other. The room was furnished in typical Morrocan style which we really liked. The only downside was the view wasn't that brilliant but we preferred it to our Cousins pool view room as ours was much bigger.  The pool area was a fair size with plenty of sunbeds & cabanas. You didn't have to get up early to get a sunbed which was great!    The food we had was ok for buffet & we did book the Italian which was excellent & also the Morrocan which was good. The only downside to the Morrocan restaurant was you had to pay 8 Euros for this & it was a set menu. There was another Menu to choose from if you wanted to pay but we felt that was unfair & spoilt the experience somewhat. Other hotels we have visited where you pay a supplement to eat in a special restaurant you get the choice of everything on the menu. The food was good that we had but we are sure that the pay menu would have been far better. Please don't let this put you off as it was still worth visiting.    On the whole we enjoyed our short stay here & the staff were quite friendly. We were able to keep our room for a late check out for 4 hours at the cost of 100DHS an hour which was convenient for us.    Thank you to Isham in The buffet restaurant & Rashid in The Lobby bar who took very good care of us & Thank you to the hotel for making our anniversary that much more special!

Kenzi Menara Palace,Paige W wrote a review Sep 2016,30,"Good, made much better by individual staff",My mum sister and I stayed here during September for a short break for a bit of winter sun.    The rooms are nice - large clean nice bathrooms good storage nice little patio area. Although the pillows and mattresses are hard as rocks. I slept like a baby but my sister couldn't stand it.    The food was okay - always a bit lukewarm but I guess that's what you get with buffet style and a bit samey. I'm not fussy so I found it fine even as a vegetarian but my mum and sister are a bit picky and weren't as impressed. We ate at the italian restaurant (that you have to pay extra for) and the service was SO SLOW. There was only one poor woman waitressing all the tables when she clearly needed an extra pair of hands. We were tempted to give up and leave. Our biggest complaint was actually the timing of dinner dinner doesn't start until 8pm?!?! It may be us being boring but by that time I was starving and falling asleep at the table. It felt far too late and drove us mad.    The hotel was nice fairly average but what made it so much better were individual staff members that went above and beyond for you. Cherif was always happy to see us and would sit and chat and help us with anything he could whereas other staff members were a little cold. Without Cherif I think we would have been less impressed but he helped us out with so much - trips where to go for a run outside extending our room clean towels even arranged toothpaste for our rooms when we run out.

The hotel is very well designed but the maintenance there is poor. The glass of my balcony was broken and the cabinet doors were worn out.    I had multiple incidences with staff there. When I first came in they told me that my booking was cancelled even though my Expedia account reminded me of it that day! After a half hour they found it but I was really worn out coming from Fes after a thirteen hour drive and they didn't even bother to offer me a cup of tea!    The next day I went to the pool after returning back from a tour and the pool boy told me there were no towels and that they closed even though it was still broad daylight at 6:30 pm! I also had to pay cash for any extras at the pool which was very inconvenient because I didn't have cash at the time!

Kenzi Menara Palace,sami-nahar wrote a review Sep 2016,50,Brilliant!,My stay at the hotel was overall pleasant. Weather was amazing with temperature reaching over 39 degrees some days. The all inclusive board basis was definitely worth it. Mini fridge freezer was topped daily with beverages. The rooms were clean and decent size. However I had problems with towels not being changed regularly. I had to ask at reception three times on one incident. The bar & hotel staff were more than happy to be of assistance. The hotel concierge Cherif was very kind and helpful. As it was my brother in law & sisters 25th wedding anniversary he delivered a surprise cake and flowers to the room which definitely made their day. We also booked all our excursions with him as I found it a lot easier (Thompson rep was rubbish at replying back to texts or was nowhere to be seen) Cherif really went out of his way to make sure we all had a lovely stay. The Italian restaurant at the hotel is a must try however you need to book beforehand which we weren't made aware of. I preferred the restaurant by the pool for lunch or evening meals. The entertainment got a bit boring by the third night of my stay different singers brought in singing the same songs. Kids entertainment seemed more appealing. The hotel provides free shuttle bus to Jema el fana square which is very handy. I would highly recommend this hotel.,Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Greater Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sami-nahar
Kenzi Menara Palace,bstubbs1 wrote a review Sep 2016,40,"Good, could be better",Stayed here for 10 nights with my boyfriend first impressions were good however some things within the hotel were disappointing.    Rooms  The rooms were stunning very spacious very clean modern and well looked after. The balcony was big and private however we had a nice view of the gardens. The rooms were cleaned every day and the bedding was made into fancy shapes which was a nice touch! Only downfall was late checkout reception staff told us different things every time. We got told we were only allowed to keep the room until 6pm for 600Dhs which was annoying as our bus didn't collect us until 9pm however a couple we met were able to keep their room until 8pm.    Food  The food we found to be very repetitive.  Breakfast was mostly the same every morning omelets pastries fresh fruit and some hot choices like sausage scrambled egg etc.  For lunch you have the choice of the main restaurant or the pool bar the main restaurant seemed quite repetitive however the food always tasted fantastic. The pool bar food was also very nice however there is not much to choose from on the menu.  Evening meals were similar to lunch although it was all very nice. The only thing that let us down was the meat always seemed very very fatty. Drink wise the wine was always warm always had to ask for ice in the wine. The pool bar serves some lovely cocktails and juices any upgrades such as common cocktails and premium spirits you had to pay extra for. My boyfriend drank San Miguel (which was included in all inclusive) however towards the end of our holiday for 2 days he was told that he had to have the stuff they needed to get rid of before he could have a San Miguel! Which I thought was a joke as when your all inclusive you pay to eat and drink what you want when you want.    Service  Was not satisfied with the service at all to be honest. Staff are not at all attentive. It seemed that the french got special attention over the English at all times. As you cannot go up and get your own drinks we found that we would be waiting ages for someone to attend to us. One night we had completely finished eating before someone decided to ask us if we would like drinks! When we had actually ordered our drinks multiple times they would bring me a glass of wine and forget to bring my boyfriends beer. Then when we asked again they would bring a completely different beer to what he asked for! Dont get me wrong all the staff were friendly and polite they just need to be a bit faster and on the ball with their service. The bar staff at the piano bar were lovely and friendly.    Pool  The pool area is clean and well kept. We didn't have a problem getting sun loungers in the day there were always plenty. Umbrellas however were a nightmare. If we had an umbrella and went for lunch or left our sunloungers we would return to fnd the umbrella had been taken by the pool boys and given to someone else. We were not the only ones who experienced this either. Again around the pool the french seemed to receive special treatment for example the pool staff would personally reserve loungers certain people even though there is a sign saying you cant reserve them...    Spa  We didn't use the spa facilities but I did go to see how much a back massage was and it was 850Dhs which works out at about £75!! So overpriced its ridiculous. Go into town if you want any spa treatments its a lot cheaper!    Entertainment  There is no upbeat entertainment at all. In the restaurant there was a saxophone player which was nice in the background and a low key singer in the piano bar. It seemed that the entertainment came alive on sundays as they had waterpolo in the day and Moroccan dancing entertainment at night which I must admit was absolutely fantastic. Apart from that we found ourselves to be quite bored at night. There is however 2 nightclubs just a 2 minute walk away from the hotel Pacha and 555. You can get in Pacha for free with your hotel wristband. Drinks are quite expensive but its not much different to a club in the UK. Highly recommend 555!    Out of hotel  The square Jemaa el Fna is definitely worth a visit. It is so overwhelming on your first visit but it is so worth it. Very cultural there are people dancing busking selling local goods and food it was brilliant definatley something to see. The Souks are also beautiful so colourful and the smells of the different spices are lovely. However it is very easy to get lost!! Be warned! Locals will help you and some will even personally take you back to the square however they will want money!! We experienced a bad encounter with 2 Moroccan men which could of easily escalated so be very very careful!  There is also a sky bar which we went to in Hotel La Renissiance to watch the sunset the view was beautiful very worth it.    Overall we did have a lovely time at Kenzi Menara Palace.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Kit32 wrote a review Sep 2016,40,Good location and friendly staff,Stayed here for a week with a friend all inclusive.  The staff were extremely helpful when we asked to change room (we had very loud neighbors) when asking about local sights of interest etc. The concierge arranged a guide for us to see the Souk with ease and on asking for a traditional restaurant experience made the booking for us and then arranged the transport for us without even being asked to - great service.  The rooms were spacious and clean. Our shower tended to flood our bathroom a bit but we requested extra towels to cope with it which were provided.The WiFi is a bit hit and miss in areas but generally good.  Occasionally you would have to ask for things a few times from the waiters and bar staff but generally given the hotels large size I'd say the service was averagely good.  The hotel moved our evening meal to the pool area and laid on 'local entertainment' for the Saturday evening - this was not very enjoyable as it was hard to see the food on the buffet and we couldn't hear each other talk over the music. However it did make a change from hearing the Saxophonist in the restaurant that only had 1 set of songs which he played all week.  Hotel runs a shuttle-bus to the market which takes about 10 minutes although stops at 7pm and only runs every 2 hours.  It's in a good location (nearby 2 night clubs and the Souk and only a short ride from the airport). I would say its more 4* than 5* although I have no other Moroccan experiences to compare with it.

I found a cockroach on the staircase which was there for the last two days of our stay!  The swimming pool is large but not very clean.  The bright spot was Cherrif the concierge who organised a couple of trips for us.  The hotel runs a shuttle bus to and from the town centre but the last one returns at 7.15 so you have to get a taxi back 80 dr if you want to see the night market.  All in all if we went back to Marrakesh which I would happily do then we would stay in a central Riad.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Oxford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/libbsgibbs

Kenzi Menara Palace,nasher1888 wrote a review Sep 2016,30,Good but not worthy of 5*,My boyfriend and I stayed here for a week in early September. We both agreed that while overall the hotel is lovely it doesn't really seem like a 5 star experience. We went all inclusive which at first is hard to figure out exactly what is included and it isn't specified exactly anywhere we could see. Breakfast buffet brunch lunch buffet pool bar food and dinner buffet plus free room service 12am-6am means there's always something going if you're hungry at any time of the day which is great. Bar selection isn't extensive but sufficed two brands of lager and variety of cocktails. Different bars had different drinks available so there's plenty of choice overall. Alcohol was either super strong (tequila cocktail tasted like petrol!) or weak (double g&t tasted like tonic alone) but that could be down to personal tastes. Buffet choices were average at breakfast there was a mix of continental buffet and hot breakfast foods but if you're after a full English it's not what you'd call traditional with creamed mushrooms and potatoes offered. Regardless there's always something to like even if it's not what you're used to. Dinner buffet has selection of tagines which are nice plus extensive salads lunch buffet is similar.  Service could be a little better waiters are very polite but it takes a while when busy for them to notice if you need more drinks more cutlery plates clearing etc. One morning we had to resort to a sad little table outside around the back as all the tables inside were either being used or full of dirty crockery which had not been cleared. This brings me onto probably the disappointment of our holiday - we weren't told by staff or our rep that it was a public holiday lasting most of the week and therefore there were many large groups of morrocans dining and using the loungers by the pools all reserving them in big long lines ALL DAY even though there were signs saying not to. This slowed down service and our trips into Marrakech were very disappointing as most stalls were closed due to the holiday. It would have been nice if someone could have mentioned this so we could have got a proper Marrakech experience even paying 400+dh for a guided tour when there was basically nothing going on. I'll mention again the pool - pool itself and bar is great again slow service when busy but staff are polite enough. Sun loungers are reserved despite this being prohibited meaning it can be hard to find anywhere even when you go down relatively early at 9.30am.  Overall it was a nice relaxing holiday very clean hotel staff very friendly and helpful but service a little slow and some disappointing factors around the pool and information provided.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nasher1888
Kenzi Menara Palace,Lizz W wrote a review Sep 2016,30,Top class service from the best concierge in town!,I'm here in Marrakech with my housemate for some much-needed end of summer sun.  Our requirements were as simple as guaranteed weather a clean room and a sun lounger to hang out on so we've got everything we need.  Whilst some of the service is questionable and organisation isn't always the best we have to give a massive shout out and thank you to Cherif the concierge. He's always helpful always smiling and does everything he can to help.  On an otherwise average trip Cherif has gone above and beyond and we are so grateful for him being here...what a legend!!,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/392lizzw
Kenzi Menara Palace,Grace wrote a review Sep 2016,50,Best hotel I have ever been to,Take no notice of bad reviews. This hotel is luxury 5 star. We had all inclusive board. Lovely food enormous room. Lovely helpful staff especially Sharif the head concierge who although Moroccan spoke excellent English and did the best mick taker of my northern accent I have ever heard😅. Massive pool. Lovely local musicians playing in the bars and restaurants in the evenings. Moroccan music playing low throughout communal areas and incense burners giving off a lovely oriental aroma. Shuttle bus to Marrakech square 5 times a day. Atlas mountain trip is a must. What a wonderful holiday. If you are a hotel person you could stay in the hotel for the duration of your holiday as everything you need is there. Due to late booking we had a garden and road view which was quiet and not a problem. Check out is 11am but Sharif sorted us to stay till 2 free and then the spa is available to freshen up and AI is until you depart.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Littleborough, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Magbrad

Kenzi Menara Palace,Matt C wrote a review Sep 2016,30,Beautiful hotel but don't trust anyone including the hotel!,Beautiful Hotel and really has the WOW factor. The pools great too. The bedroom is amazing with a beautiful bathroom and balcony. Beds are firm and aircon could be cooler but it was 47*C. The maids let themselves in and out as they please despite asking them not to. Water is brought to your door without asking but your not told its charged to your room. The Concierge is not to be trusted.. Appears to be genuine and very nice but will rip you off when offering excursions. He told me a trip to the Atlas mountains would cost 800Dr for two of us combined and would take 30 mins to get there. 6hrs it took and we didn't get the full excursion to the waterfall. We were dropped off and given to a guide who told us we had to pay a further 200Dr each for a 2 hour walk to the waterfall. Not enclosed by the hotel. We couldn't go because we didn't take much money but luckily it stormed. A very long and waste of a day. I did manage to get 50% back after complaining but then found out it had happened to two other couples. All inclusive is also for certain things. You may be charged further. Also be aware of tourist tax. We were told £3p/d/p/p.. it was £33p/p/pd which gave us a lovely bill on check out and then they tried to double charge which is now with the insurance company. And the Spa is expensive and not included in all inclusive. Lots to do locally but not advertised.

(because I am one of those people who go to the gym on holiday!) Make sure you have a traditional Moroccan Hamam whilst staying in Marrakech and explore the souks it's like a forgotten world and so amazing!

Kenzi Menara Palace,ClanMspain wrote a review Sep 2016,40,Overall good experience but some areas require attention,We booked a Prestige suite for a family of four.Although the room was very spacious the furniture and fittings were definitely showing signs of wear and tear and require replacement and updating. The website said VIP service if you booked this room but there was nothing any different to anybody else.Having said this staff were on the whole extremely friendly and could not do enough for you. A special mention must go to Sherif customer relationsand Saled at the poolside who both helped to make our stay more special. The restaurant was at times too chaotic and service became below par for a 5 star hotel but the food was generally good and they managed to cater for my daughter's special dietary requirements. Around the pool the sunbeds are definitely in need of updating and they were always in short supply we saw a few cases of sunbed rage!!and the mattresses were very shabby. Also the laundry service for the towels needs to be looked at as the towels given out often appeared still dirty.

The facilities at the hotel and the atmosphere are wonderful and the all inclusive option we went for meant you could literally eat and drink for 24 hours if you wished.  Some aspects that put a downer on the stay were staff attitude particularly managers some who appeared to always give preferrential treatment to arabic or french speaking guests. It took too long to sort out issue with ants in one of the rooms and fridge that was not working.  The staff always seemed way too busy they tried but were run off their feet and it meant you were often waiting long for service.

Kenzi Menara Palace,151GloriaS wrote a review Aug 2016,30,Disappointed this time !,I have loved visiting this hotel for the past couple of years it really would make my stay in Marrakech this year I decided to take my family out there and really show them this hotel! However this year I was slightly disappointed.    The main reason why I was disappointed is due to level of service and time provided for the French however as a Brit speaking in English was not good enough.  At breakfast I kindly asked for tea and coffee the waiter said he will make more as he ran out. I waited for more than half an hour in the mean time I asked for coffee - when the tea came out the waiter disregarded us.    Moreover I was by the pool with my younger sisters only to find French lady remove her bikini top and bathe utterly topless (in a Muslim country may I add - very disrespectful)! Darling I do NOT want to see your BITS! I found this highly offensive especially with children by the pool (in and out of the pool). I did complain but my exact response ' she is French I cannot do anything'. What on earth does this mean?!  Do not go with kids!    Food was Ok..  A/C was not strong in the rooms at all..    I hope Kenzi sort this out as it is a beautiful hotel just need to sort the staff ! Sadly I do want to bring the kids here however if women are bathing topless with their boobs out NO THANKYOU. I will go elsewhere that has higher standards.,Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,Hertforshire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/151GloriaS

Breakfast and lucnh served outside by the pool. Many choices of restaurants for dinner. The all inclusive option is worth it. There's a shuttle to Jamaa El Fna square however I think it should run later at night I think the last one is at 7:30 which is too early. If you miss the last one you'll have to grab a cab back to the hotel. Rooms are large and comfortable with separate bath and shower.

Kenzi Menara Palace,kevin g wrote a review Aug 2016,20,Not for kids,Our holiday started well at the Kenzi Manara Palace Hotel in Morocco nice reception checked in then taken to our room very nice unpacked went down for a swim at the pool.  Then came dinner if you go there with family be a bit careful with the food it caters very much for the French being there second language we never got on with the food but that's my opinion. Some of the waiters do not speak English so getting drinks or a fork changed is very hard work if you don't stand up and be a bit pushy you get ignored. We kept getting left 2 towels in the room when there was clearly 3 people there rang reception rang housekeeping but in the end had to go and get this myself 4 days this took before they got this right.  The pool area looks very good but it was not washed down once in 2 weeks we we're there at night people sit by the pool to keep cool but leave fag buts all over the place something to watch out for another thing to watch out for are the pool men sometimes you leave your beds or parasols they will take them many times we see People arguing with them because there parasol was gone you will need shade it does get hot.

Very calm and very good food although you have to be careful with water (only bottled water without ice also to brush your teeth and avoid salads and when you wash dry your fruit....).  The stuff is very nice gentle and polite people. They speak french and english.  Special thanks to Hassan who entertained our kids every day with nice programs and the best mini disco. Thanks to the nice guy who teached the kids tennis and thanks the waiters at the resaurant and the nice people at the reception.  It was a very good vacation for us!

DOWNSIDE: the service in restaurants around the pool bar the general bar and around the pool and in general was atrocious!!!! We had to find and lay our table for breakfast ourselves. We asked for tea and coffee and 9 times out if 10 we ended up getting it ourselves. The same occurred at lunch and dinner but our drinks order arrived after 20-30 minutes and was invariably incorrect! At lunch the waiter took your order and again it took ages to arrive and most of the time it was wrong! We alsonoticed that after leaving our table at about 1.30pm a lot of the tables weren't cleared when we left the pool area at 5.30pm and were swarming with flies and wasps! Some of the desserts such as large tarts weren't served individually or portioned and hence a lot of them were mashed up because of it..  In general we weren't made to feel welcome by the waiting staff but made to feel more of an inconvenience ! And we noticed how local guests were treated much better and served like royalty!  In comparison with our holiday in Turkey last year where all the staff welcomed us by name chatted to our 5 year old grandson and ensured all our needs were met with a courteous and friendly manner this hotel was an extreme let down.

Lunch  probably the best thing about the holiday  the chicken and shish skewers are really good.  the only decent food we ate all holiday.  there are birds that live in the pool bar roof but that didn't really bother us.  the bar staff aren't really interested in doing much to help you.    dinner  what a shambles this was!  some of the worst food ive ever eaten in my life.  it based outside in the pool bar.  the first night we were there the table cloths were covered and I mean COVERED in ants. really put us off.  then we tried the food and it was horrible. the options for the buffet are poor.  they had mixed rice but no plain rice. and everything seemed under cooked.  tried the Italian a la carte resultant and that was very basic.    ive never been on an all inclusive holiday and been so hungry in all my life!!    yes the food really is that bad!!!    pools  theres a massive main pool which we didn't use as the tiles around the pool were cracked and loose.  the loungers were all dirty and not properly looked after.  very very poor standards    the small 'adult' pool was really good. except when kids were running riot in it.  but that wasn't too bad overall.    the owners turned up on the Friday and seemed to read the riot act all the staff started cleaning the loungers and organising everything a bit better.  they were there for about 20 mins and saw that the hotel was a shambles!    to summarise  if you want to throw your money down the drain stay in this 'hotel'  if you don't want to waste your money go somewhere else!,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Urmston, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amirnoorali

Large amount of flies/birds who like to share your meal. After 1 trip to breakfast and seeing the disaster we decided to have a lie in instead!  - We only saw the pool being cleaned once in week we were there and lots of pavement slabs were broken (saw these being 'replaced' on our last day)  - Towards end of week due to more families with children there was a bit of a battle on about seating in restaurant at dinner particularly around 8-9pm when we ate and sometimes a real hunt for sunbeds around the pool  - Ensure your 'do not disturb sign is on as staff do just walk into your room and could not find a lock inside the room  - Glad we left when did as Kids club started up around pool and influx of rude English guests...    Sherif organised 2 trips for us - Camel ride at sunset (£40 for 2) and guide around the souks in the morning for 2 hours (£20 for 2) - not sure the guide was actually that interested in his job... but didn't help tour was 10am-12pm and considerably warm. Ensure you have lots of small notes here for entry to museums etc as we ran out halfway through (some haggling issues by other half on some slippers) and had to miss out.    Beautifully warm throughout the week - even experienced a sand storm and a refreshing rain storm!    Great hotel but needs a little bit of love.

The pool restaurant is great for lunch and BBQ dinners the hotel restaurant for breakfast is probably too small but the food is fine for breakfast. We weren't impressed with the Italian but it was still fine - and included in our package. The hotel staff are great and Cherif helped us organize a very last minute trip to the Atlas Mountains which was good and reasonably priced. We also used the free shuttle into the Medina which was again very efficient. The hotel is only a 15 minute drive from the airport but a nice distance from the busy square - only £8 taxi.

This hotel is vast the bedrooms are huge and the gardens are emense. So much space you do definitely not feel crowded or rushed it has a very laid back chilled feel.  With this laid back approach don't expect immediate service you have to be patient and enjoy the wait!

Kenzi Menara Palace,Nashxx s wrote a review Aug 2016,40,"Fantastic Holiday, will definitely return!",Spent one week ALL INCLUSIVE with the family at this hotel our holiday began the last two days of the holy month ramadthan.On Eid day the hotel made it possible for us to do our prayers and interact with the local community. Having been agadir the year before we was excited to visit marrekesh for the first time.The hotel is 10min away from the airport and only 10min away from the city centre as well.  The hotel is very clean lovely rooms that are cleaned and filled with drinks daily.Big thanks to the waiters especially; ASHRAF (assistant manager ) KHAWLA and NAWAL those took good care of us during meal times.    Drivers who took us to and from the city centre (outside the khutubia mosque ) were sufianAmin and Kamal.  The following members of staff DONIABUSHRA HIND  ZAHRA and FATIMA took care of us whilst at the lounge.  Hisham is in charge of the excursions he surely will give you a good deal if you hassle him.  The biggest thanks goes to the hotel management Mr.CHERIF and MHINA.They ensured everything was smooth during our stay.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Kayla2000 wrote a review Aug 2016,50,Just returned,Hi just returned from staying a week at this hotel and I'm going to be honest at times I was disappointed. First of all there was a number of occasions where there was no pool towels so we would have to sit at wait for 30-45 minutes to get some. I also saw the pool guys taking other peoples towels of there sun loungers while people weren't there and giving them to other people. On two occasions the maid didn't replace the towels in our so we had to call reception which they did eventually bring the towels. Most mornings there where no glasses to get a drink and the tables where always dirty not been cleaned from the last people. Twice the room key stop working which was an annoyance. The thing that disappointed me the most was that they wouldn't provide late check out even though we where willing to pay. The guy at the desk said they where fully booked but I only saw a few people arrive the whole 7 hours I waited in the lobby for the coach to arrive. There's potential here but the service is poor at times. For the money I paid its not worth it.,Date of stay: June 2016,,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kayla2000

The room was done up to an excellent standard with house keeping everyday. We were able check in before our check in time as the room was ready which was helpful as we wete able to get on with the day!    Breakfast was great outdoors although there were alot of bees buzzing around. Was very busy but staff always tried to be accomodating.    Food was great we did not go all inclusive but kids were able to eat for free!    Pool was great with children's area. As they had an additional pool area. it meant that those who wanted to spend time in the pool without children being around they could do so but also gave the children their own space.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Annie B wrote a review Jul 2016,30,Hen do,Me and my 3 friends visited this hotel and booked a 2bedroom suite for 2 nights and on arrival the suite and one bedroom was ready however the interconnecting room (second bedroom) was not- as we were only in Morocco for 3 days we had a lot to fit in and need to get ready and with 4 girls we needed the other room and bathroom space. Our room was not ready until 5pm after being told it would be ready in 10 minutes at 1pm. Once we had given our room the ac was not working we contacted reception several times and unfortunately the air conditioning in that second room was not fully working throughout our stay.  Mr sharif the kind gentlemen sorted out quad biking and camel rides for the next day and gave us a good price. Picked up and dropped off back to the hotel at a time to suit us.  We also arranged a surprise cake for our friends bday which never showed leaving us feeling the service in general was not upto scratch - however on informing Mr sharif about this he kindly arranged a time for us on the last day to come to our room with 3 members of staff with cake and flowers and sang our friend happy bday a day later but it was lovely so thank you.    Overall me and my friends were annoyed by the problems we faced with the ac in our second room as it was so hot and this was no rectified. But generally the hotel is lovely and staff friendly and the security guard on the night shift walked us girls to the club which was a few minutes away which was very kind of him.    The snacks by the pool was not very nice we ordered the screwers and my friends meat was uncooked. The room service night menu was great- lovely burgers and fresh chips  And then sadly the following day we ordered room service lunch and the chicken sandwich was hard and chips reheated.  Breakfast was okay plenty of choices    We used the spa and that was amazing really nice hammam massages and facials  Staff is very nice and friendly great indoor pool in the spa too.,Date of stay: July 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/214annieb

The service at the hotel however was not up to a 5* standard especially the staff at the restaurant. One waiter in particular (name tag had ''Anas' written on it) was very rude and lacked manners. The hotel offered a shuttle to the old medina but the last ride finishes at 19:15. Hence if you want to get back to the hotel you need to take a taxi.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Jude&Jess wrote a review Jul 2016,30,A nice place to stay but all in all a 3.5 experience,This is a very palatial hotel: Large rooms sweeping foyer cocktail bar and buffet restaurant near the swimming pool with just enough sun loungers and day beds for the vast number of guests. The authentic moroccan musicians at night were lost in the Moroccan restaurant situated inside the complex which was a shame as would have been wonderful to have had them by the pool where the majority of dinners are each evening - instead we were subjected to the saxophone version of karaoke - which i guess was 'romantic' but maybe a bit cheesy and not very authentic for my preferred taste.    But saying that I wouldn't normally stay at a resort style hotel in a place as rich in culture as Marrakesh but we did so because of the 5 star amenities and the great swimming pool. Ultimately we wanted to mix culture with shameless relaxation - which we got just right I'd say; combining relaxing hours and hours by the pool sipping cocktails with walks and explorations in town finding fine dining and cultural learning. The shuttle bus from the hotel to the centre of the old town 5 times a day was very handy and definitely bridged the gap created by the distance away from ANYTHING else in the area. (Give it 5-10 years and I'm sure the area will have a life of its own judging by the constructions in hand). With 3 restaurants 2 bars live music pools spa and shops the hotel has a lot to offer and we managed to squeeze in a leisurely Hammam treatment to totally relax us out. We also booked an away day trip through Cherif the concierge and our driver Sala took us into the Atlas Mountains and arranged for guide to take us on a mountain trek via a waterfall. It was a great change to the bustle of city life and Sala was very interesting to talk to and tried to meet as many of our wishes as he could. Totally a highlight of the holiday!    Back in the hotel we didn't opt for the Fully Inclusive package as didn't expect to eat at the hotel much but again due to its isolated location we ended up just lounging out there on a number of days and having no other dining options. I didn't imagine this adding up so much as it was literally 2 lunches and 2 dinners but it did! The Buffet is not cheap! (£30 a head per meal) - which considering it was so hot all i actually wanted was a small plate of salad it felt like a complete rip off (not the greatest food in the world either - which for that price is a joke). We found out after the 4th and final meal in the hotel that there was in fact an al a carte menu that may have been more cost affective for us. The drinks were also above London prices but I guess in a dry country you pay for the privilege of being a heathen.    Over all - Lovely staff very friendly and happy to please. Amenities clean and stylish. Room was luxurious and comfortable and the balcony was a joy. The wifi is temperamental. The general cost i'd say isn't great value for money given how cheap the country is (for non tourists). unfortunately we had a few occasions towards the end of our stay when communications internally broke down and we found ourselves disappointed again and again by the service (or lack of it). Which was sad way to end a good holiday.,Date of stay: July 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JudeJess
Kenzi Menara Palace,dave s wrote a review Jul 2016,30,Almost perfect,Firstly the hotel itself is fantastic and without the faults I would rate it 5 star  The all inclusive drinks were at a high standard to.  The minor faults  There are not enough umbrellas for everyone pretty bad when temp gets in the 40s.  The staff are over worked by the French and leaves the service to the English poor  I don't really need to be waited on I can help myself no problem but when u can't get it yourself like tea n coffee at breakfast or a beer at evening meal you shouldn't have to wait ages.  There is no entertainment whatsoever.  The air con through the whole hotel ( room reception and indoor restaurants) is not great at all especially again when it gets mega hot. Which leads to the major fault  as it was to hot to eat indoors we had to eat outside where the food was OK but only half was actually edible as you shared your food with the birds . yes birds if your lucky you find a chair without bird poo on .  And when I say birds I don't mean 1 or 2 there is loads 50 plus easy. Half the food is covered up and should be fine but the rest is open for birds to land peck and poo on.  Let me mention the good points as I would go back even with the faults.  The pool area the gardens and the room are amazing. The hotel itself like I said almost perfect they get a lot right. Massive rooms free mini bar free safe. Gardens look stunning.

Kenzi Menara Palace,scottblessed wrote a review Jul 2016,50,Loved this place.,This was me and my (just married) wife's first trip to Marrakech. We emailed the hotel in advance to let them know how excited we were about coming to spend our honey moon with them.    Upon arrival we were greeted by warm welcoming and friendly staff who made our arrival nothing short of a pleasure. We were told our room was upgraded to a better suite for free which was just fantastic news. We can't thank them enough for that.    The hotel itself is beautifully decorated on the inside. Providing a nice middle Eastern meets Art Deco type of setting it was beautiful to walk around and I did for hours just snapping pictures of the lobby and grounds with my camera. There are 3 or 4 restaurants in the hotel all offering different food choices and we generally ate in one of these places most nights. There is a hotel bar which serves great cocktails whisky cigars and beer and a pool bar that is cheap for food and good for refreshing drinks. There are also two shops in the foyer one for cigarettes cigars snacks and brick a brack and another which seemed to sell traditional dress wear and ornaments. Very handy for gifts.    The hotel also provides a free shuttle service to and from town which is handy.    Our room was on the second floor and because of our upgrade our suite boasted two balconies a huge living room a huge bedroom a well equipped bathroom and two toilet areas. The room was incredibly clean kept well stocked and the house keeping staff were so polite.    The pool area is also fantastic boasting one of the largest hotel pools I have ever seen and another smaller one (which was great for trapping the sun and having warmer water). Seating around the pool was no problem with an abundance of loungers and little (more private and comfortable) booths with some curtains for shade.    Breakfast was included in our package I'm not sure if it normally is but every morning boasted an all you can eat continental and cooked breakfast buffet with cheeses meats breads cooked foods fresh fruit (incredible grapefruit and watermelon) yoghurt fresh juice cereals. Everything.    I realise I have rambled a bit but I really can't say much of a bad word about the hotel. The staff were great helpful and always chatting with us the room was clean and relaxing the pool area was clean the prices was relatively inexpensive considering the grandness of the hotel. Most things were the same price or cheaper than what I pay here in Scotland. loved it.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Westhill, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottblessed

Kenzi Menara Palace,Christine S wrote a review Jul 2016,40,GREAT HOTEL FOR A RELAXING BREAK,We arrived after a short drive from the airport (15 minutes) and were very impressed with the reception area politeness of the reception staff and the large pool view room.  The cleaning staff are working non stop not only to keep rooms clean but the general hotel areas as well.  There is a large pool area where the water is a bit cold but very welcome with the heat there is also a smaller pool but as it was quiet we didn't feel the need to sit there. Free towels and the guys around the pool can't do enough to help with sunbeds etc..  There is ample food available at any time but it does get a bit repetitive and a week was enough of eating the same things. The Italian restaurant was OK but not great and we didn't try the Moroccon restaurant.  Entertainment was a saxophone player in the evenings by the pool bar and nothing during the day apart from music around the pool but this felt like a more adult hotel and I wouldn't have wanted to have had children with me as they would have been bored.  There is building works going on at the moment but we didn't find it that intrusive and were amazed at the lack of health & safety rules in Morocco !!  We used the Concierge Cherif to help with a couple of trips and he was super helpful and I would highly recommend asking his advice.  There is a free shuttle bus into the City but we didn't use it.  The only slight negative from this hotel was that some of the staff are amazing and some shall we say 'need some further training'.  I would return to this hotel and spoke to some people whilst here who come to Marrakech regularly and they said it has its pros and cons against others they have stayed in but they all have good and bad so guessing that's as good a recommendation as you can get.  NOTE: there is a 3 euro charge per person per night for 'government taxes' we didn't know this but they will take any currency to pay for it. Reception will change your money whilst you are there and were very helpful.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Bath, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teena999
Kenzi Menara Palace,GrahameHportsmouth wrote a review Jul 2016,40,Lovely hotel,Stayed here recently with my partner for a week and must say had a wonderful time. The hotel itself is very grand airy and comfortable room was nice and bed huge great view of the pool area from our balcony and loved the bathroom with two basins so we could both get ready at the same time.  Staff seemed professional and friendly especially the concierge who as well as being extremely helpful recommending and setting up our trips also made us laugh every day with his greetings and chit chat.  The hotel also provide a bus into the city at regular intervals during the day and this proved very handy also saved on cab fares.  We were not all inclusive so got a surprise when ordering drinks at the pool side bar very expensive so consequently we did not use the hotel bars very often I can only assume the all inclusive package is worthwhile as most appeared to be on it we prefer not to so we can explore local cuisine in the city.  Pool are is very nice no problem getting sunbeds and the hotel observes a no reserving sunbed policy which is refreshing the pool itself is large but quite cold when we were there but the temp will always be related to the outside temp and the time of day so not sure why people would complain about this as I've seen in other reviews.  Other than price of drinks our only other minor annoyance was having to get the staffs attention every morning at breakfast to get coffee or tea served that said the breakfast room seemed to be under staffed so I think there is an improvement to be made there.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Hayles T wrote a review Jul 2016,50,Fantastic hotel and grounds,We stayed at the hotel from 30 June for 4 nights and we had the most amazing time. I cannot speak highly enough of Sharif the concierge who went out of his way to make us feel welcome and to look after us. He also organised a private guide and car for us to see the various sights of Marrakech which was a fantastic experience.    We arrived hours before the room should have been ready due to a very early flight and Sharif organised breakfast for us and fairly prompt access to our room which was huge and absolutely perfect with a view over the pool from the balcony.    We stayed as an all inclusive package and the choice of food and the standard of it was excellent. The staff were always courteous and helpful.    The hotel itself is stunning and although there was a small amount of building work happening while we were there I do not feel that I was bombarded with the sound of builders at any point during our stay and they kept the area they were working in very clean and tidy at all times.    We had a few different treatments in the hotel spa as well and the staff were constantly professional and the treatments were outstanding. I've never felt so relaxed and refreshed.    I wouldn't hesitate to stay at this hotel again or recommend it to my friends and family. If you stay here and you are greeted by Sharif then you will have hit the jackpot in terms of having someone who is at all times friendly and professional and determined to ensure that you have an absolutely superb stay.,Date of stay: July 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Northampton,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LadyHayles
Kenzi Menara Palace,Ritahkm wrote a review Jul 2016,10,Bad service and constructions in the hotel!!,This was our worst Experience of hôtels in Marrakech!  We arrived to the hotel and they applied a higher Price than the one we booked saying they need to charge additional fees..  Also there was a complete New aisle Bening consutructed and eventough the work was supposed to start From 10:30-5PM they were starting at7:30 so we couldn't rest at all.  Finally the credit card holdup was kept for more than 3 week ; we had to complain to the hotel by calling several times for them to release it with no compensation whatsoever!!  I definitely do not recommend going to this hotel there are plenty of other choices in Marrakech.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Alim K wrote a review Jun 2016,40,The perfect getaway,Stayed here for a week on all inclusive with a friend. While I had some trepidation about the quality of the food and service I have to say everything was great.    We were treated very well by staff (who even extended our checkout due to a late flight) and found that they were really really nice. It was ramadan during our visit but despite this the staff were (mostly) jolly.    The room was very big with plenty of space to spread out. We were in a twin room and it really felt like we had our own space.    The pool area is great and relaxing. I think the hotel was quiet when we were there and it really made a difference. There was no fighting or 'reserving' of beds and we spent the whole week lying on a giant outdoor bed. Pool towels were included and you just had to collect fresh ones each day. There are two pools one very large one that is slightly cooler and one shallow pool that's warmer (although when it's 45 degrees you'll want to spend most of the time in cool pool).    Amazingly there's an a la carte lunch service at the pool bar included in the all inclusive. The food is fine (pizza burgers salads grilled chicken skewers etc) but it's nice not to have think about what you're doing if you just want to get away.    By the end of the week dinner had become a bit much but the food was still fine. Traditional fare (tagines Moroccan salads etc) and then some western stuff was served each day.    What was great is that this really isn't a destination for boozy Brits abroad. It's got a very serine adult feel to it which is perfect if you're looking for a chill out.    In parts the hotel could do with a bit of TLC (chipped paint bit dusty some modernising) but it's hardly noticeable. Only negative was that the free (so it's not really a negative) bus to the city was a bit temperamental.    If you're going don't expect a totally luxurious 5 star resort with michelin starred food especially if you're all inclusive. But for the price the Kenzi Manara was the perfect getaway. Just wish we could've stayed longer.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/224alimk
Kenzi Menara Palace,Paul C wrote a review Jun 2016,10,Service poor; we wanted to relax but we had to chase every single thing,"Having spent a few days in the hustle & bustle of a the Medina and staying in a lovely small Riad with excellent service we transferred to this Spa hotel to relax and unwind for the end of our holiday.    However the service was so poor which made our stay unrelaxing. Every single thing had to be chased several times. From something required to the room - 4 phonecalls and waiting 45 minutes. To waiting for cutlery as our food got cold.    Common response from the staff was ""no problem"" ""no problem"" but it is a problem when the staff completely ignore one's requests for simple things and you sit waiting like an idiot. It is a problem when one has a child and the child ends up eating with his fingers because the staff cannot bring cutlery after several requests and there is none to collect ourselves.    Even at check-out with a plane to catch I had requested our luggage be brought down to Receptio giving over an hours notice. Yet the luggage was not there and we had to wait a further 15 minutes chasing chasing.    Eventually at the end of my tether I asked to speak to the 'duty manager' but Reception stated there was not one even present at the hotel until later; there was no one available to manage or deal with a simple complaint. That may demonstrate the problem and lack of service with no manager no leadership and no one taking responsibility.    Potentially a good hotel but this was a most disappointing stay as it would have been so easy for the hotel to improve their service.",Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S7476MUpaulc

Check in wasn't great to be honest lots of confusion about my booking and took a bit of time to resolve but very helpful staff so not too bad!    Room again a couple of issues first room was in the corner of the hotel and basically looked onto the roofs and air con units however again staff excelled and showed me several rooms with the option to switch which resolved this promptly!    Food selection was very good cooking stations great every night and for lunch I just ate at the pool bar pizza did the trick!    All areas where immaculate and housekeeping top marks great towel art everyday!    Not much in the way of entertainment but as it was a chill out week that didn't matter great place to retreat to after a crazy outing to Marrakech during the day!    What made it for me was the staff so helpful and polite and yes I did tip and yes they did really appreciate it but I would imagine the service would be just as good without it but credit where due....

Kenzi Menara Palace,Briano1561 wrote a review Jun 2016,50,Great Stay!!,Just back from a 3 night stay at the Kenzi Menara and it was a fantastic trip. From when we arrived the staff could not help enough. The room was beautiful clean and an excellent view of the pool and mountains was a bonus.  We spent 90% of our 3 night 4 day stay at the hotel. The pool area was heaven. Our hardest choice was deciding on whether to sit on the poolside chairs or on the beds behind them to soak up the 30 degree heat. The bar area right next to the pool was a help too. They provide as many towels as you like down by pool also.  On every trip we try and see the culture side of the area too so once we we gave a day and a half by the pool we decided to look into tours. All you have to do is go to reception and ask for tourist information and they will point you in the direction of the head concierge Mr Cherif. We just had to sit back and let the rest happen. We told him in general what we were interested in doing and he organised everything. The following morning we had a driver waiting for us out the front of the hotel along with our own private guide. We were taken to the Souks the tombs Bahia palace Majorelle jardin etc to do at our own pace. This took up about a half day. The following day a driver collected us and took us outside of the city to do a camel ride. The two days with driver (private guide on the first day) cost 1300dr around €120 for the two of us which is very reasonable. Only €60 each. Just please tip people who provide you a service as we both work in the industry and even a little can mean a lot. Set aside some 20's 50's and 100 dirham notes for tips. Entry fees to the places mentioned above are really cheap!!  On one of our days we had an issue with an ATM taking money out of our account without the cash being given. Once again when we came back to our hotel and explained what happened to us (which wasn't the hotels problem) Mr Cherif organised the hotel driver to take us back to the bank and sort the issue and bring us back again free of charge. The lady at the reception was also very helpful.  On a side note the hotel is really clean and all staff are very well presented.  Would recommend staying at the Kenzi to anyone and when you arrive just ask for Mr Cherif tell him the young Irish couple recommended him and sit back and relax.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Briano1561

Food was quite good with regular change of menu to suit all taste.It is not goumet OK but with sufficient quality and quantity. I particularly enjoyed the Italian restaurant. Breakfast was substantial but could be improved - Having said all that I think this hotel needs to change the attitude of the staff. They are efficient but don't expect service with a smile. They attend to all your request with a "" I couldn't care less attitude"".  No smile no enthusiasm on thei part.. At times I felt like they are doing me a favour by having to attend me.

Kenzi Menara Palace,PriyaxG wrote a review Jun 2016,20,VISUALLY LOVELY HORRIBLE STAFF AND MANAGEMENT,Arriving for a 6 night stay with 4 of us girls we were looking forward to this holiday on arrival we could not complain the hotel visually was stunning and the rooms were also lovely and a good size as well as the pool. Aside from this it completely was the worst stay i could have experienced which totally ruined our stay in Marrakech. We unfortunately went during ramadan which was the worst thing we could've done the staff were all miserable mainly the MALE STAFF and they had no respect towards women. On our first night we decided to go to a restaurant within the hotel which we had no idea we had to book as nothing was explained to us upon arrival. Being faced with an pretty empty restaurant with about 6 guests at the time the member of star questioned if we had a reservation when telling him we did not know he was refusing to seat us. We then went on to ask if the reason we cannot be seated was if it was fully booked and the answer was NO so we did not understand why we could not have been seated. After forcing him to let us eat within they call a 5 staff hotel we then went on to get the worst service ever by the member of staff he was saying things in his language ( swearing) and had an issue with anything we asked for did nit was to help us or serve us and this was out first night in the hotel . After this we just thought it was just him and the rest of the staff would be fine the following day we needed to exchange so money the hotel has an exchange area for the pure reason for customers to exchange money . When us four girls went to do this they staff member did not have the correct changed to give back to us and expected us to just share our money but we had all exchanged certain amount and wanted our particular funds back according to what we had given when asking for this the member of staff who job it was to sort this out for us just laughed at us and said can't you even sort out your own change between yourself bearing in mind he had given us notes which we could not change laughing and smirking at us like it was our resposibluty to have sorted out how they money we exchanged induviadully was going to be split seeing us struggling the staff member at reception did not once try help and say he was go find some change and give us what we were owed however they were very fast to take out english money. After this incident we was compleoety put off but we did nor want to ruin our stay following from this at breakfast lunch and dinner we pretty much experienced this every day until our last day. very unhelpful anything we needed was an issue even though we had paid so much to stay at this hotel. There was a gentleman named CHERFIE who was the only helpful member of staff out of 100's who gave us such nice service and was so help better than their own management. The sad part was this issue only seemed to be with us whenever the staff were serving white people they seemed ever so happy and treated us very different as we were Asian. its sad to say we were treated differently due to our skin colour  through out our stay we didn't do anything disruptive treated all staff with respect and we got treated so bad it was as if they had targeted just us . The day before our last we decided to speak to the manager as we was so disappointed .. as expected he told us sorry and he will look into it and sad he is going to pay for dinner for us which he INVITED us to then to the laughable point he gave us free buffet which was cheap and cold and turned around and said but you still need to pay for your own drinks even though he had invited us to apologise but could not even offer us a drink with our meal. We could not wait to leave then faced with another rude member of staff upon check out who was again another manager he claimed and added a bill to our room for the mini bar which we did not touch as we had our own drinks and told us we was lying . It was the worst experience we have ever had being a 4 girls we never executed our resort to treat us how they did if anything we executed tho outside the resort but the people outside were nicer than inside . We could not wait to leave . They are definately racist against Asian people which is shocking . The only thing 5 star about the hotel is the budding other than that it deserves nothing avoid this hotel if you are looking for good hospitality as they make you feel its all your fault and its all your problem not theirs.

Room was spacious ground floor double with extra bed for our daughter we were happy although a pool view room would have been nicer I think. Pool area was lovely very large very clean but VERY cold! it was early april though so we didnt expect it to be warm water.Sunbeds and loungers were plentiful and free pool towels were great. We found the food at breakfast and dinner to be good quality the service however was not as good I'm afraid. We did have a nice time in the 5 days we were there but I made a list on my phone during the holiday that may come in handy for someone Very hard to get coffee/tea at breakfast even when dining room quiet often no teaspoons or salt/pepper on tables we had a towel stolen from our ground floor patio (strangely) the mini bar was not sufficiently refilled daily there was no milk in room for tea/coffee and we had only 1 teabag and 2 coffee sachets the lock on the patio door was broken and had been fixed in a temporary fashion the omlettes and fried eggs were slightly undercooked for my taste so I ate hard boiled eggs however on the thursda there were none at all there is not enough info in room regarding what's on or what is included with all inc option there was little evening entertainment the cash machine was not working and we could not withdraw cash from reception very strangely our daughters bed was removed on the first night and we had to request it be put back (this took an hour or more) the connecting room was unlocked so we thought we had been given use of it but we enquired at reception and they said no the room was never occupied all the time we were there. Ice cream from the pool bar was only available from 3pm on all inc and the pool bar toilets almost always had no toilet paper handtowels or soap. I know this sounds petty and moany but I am just giving an honest review would we go back? maybe but there are plenty of other hotels to try so maybe not......I would like to mention that the hotel is very clean and 75% of the staff were outstanding so for the right price it is certainly one to consider,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Hibaldstow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/52kerryw

At check in we were greeted by a lovely man called Ahmed who after seeing our rings guessed we were newly married he was correct. Ahmed quickly upgraded us to a beautiful suite and wished us a wonderful stay.  We then were escorted to the room which was beautiful and much bigger than we needed! The view of the pool and grounds were also lovely. Rooms were cleaned and beds made with fresh sheets and towels daily.  Breakfast was great good selection for all tastes. They have toast eggs cereals some sweet things Pastries and then some more European things such as meats and cheeses. There is coffee tea and juice. Always full up after!  Lunch again was brilliant. There was again a huge selection of hot meats pastas rolls fish vegetables salad....I could go on. We were filled up! You can also have Moroccan tea and little favours (see staff section below). We dined at the al la cart also and this was again to a high standard and delicious with good selection.  Dinner again was brilliant. Big selection of food and sweet treats! I honestly was surprised at how fresh the food was and picked a variety of things to choose all lovely. We dined at the Italian restaurant also which was very good!! Moroccan themed night at the hotel on Friday was amazing delicious food and great entertainment!!  Now for the staff...I had read previous reviews about staff not being friendly or not speaking English etc. I can honestly say this is untrue. Every member of staff we spoke to was lovely friendly attentive and efficient. They always had service with a smile and very good at their job!  Nearly every morning and lunch time Monsif served us. He was excellent. Friendly and attentive! He suggested Moroccan tea and chocolates which were delicious. He really went that extremely mile in making us feel welcome and made our holiday even more special.  Lhoucine at the pool bar and then at the Moroccan dinner was awesome. Super friendly super bubbly and just so lovely! Again making an extra effort to make our holiday even more special.  Even the staff members we didn't normally see maybe 1 or 2 times at lunch/dinners were so friendly! Mohammed again super friendly and another very friendly man who I never seen his name tag to give him credit! Also Hassan at the bar friendly and warm every evening! All in all fantastic staff!!  I also would highlight that the staff speak very good English as well as French and their native language. I don't know why other reviews say they don't but they honestly make a good effort to communicate with you. Personally I feel some guests did not treat the staff with enough respect a please and thank you goes a long way....and a smile!! Every person we spoke to or smiled at returned it with a warm gesture. It's nice to be nice after all!  Only disappointing comment I have is that your all inclusive status is not valid after check out which is a shame. Really we didn't arrive until 10pm on the previous Saturday and left at 5pm today so really feel it should have been extended to include lunch. Nearly dropped a star for that but the staff and the kindness shown this holiday bumped them up again!  Will be back I'd say (with an earlier flight!) thank you so much for having us!,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexandraDoherty

He is very helpful and funny with a variety of accents.... We are hoping to upgrade to all inclusive tomorrow as I think that is the better deal....the pool is massive and yes it's cold but when basking in the sun the coldness is just what u need to cool you down..... Would definitely recommend this hotel and already planning my return visit 👍🏼😎,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngieRob40
Kenzi Menara Palace,Shinaede B wrote a review May 2016,20,ShinnyB,Stayed In this hotel the first week in May. Rooms huge & could not fault the housekeeping. However the 2 single beds for the kids were very uncomfortable & they ended up sleeping in our bed..so never got a good nights sleep. Food was extremely good & something for everybody. Only problem birds had free reign & were flying in & swooping on tables & leaving their dirty droppings everywhere. I also found it amazing that a tray of uncovered cakes were placed on a table in the poolside bar in the late afternoon ... The birds had a field day!!! Very very unhygienic . Also be warned allinclusive is not until after 3pm at the pool bar but they will happily hand you the bill when you have eaten. There should be a sign up to warn people it's very misleading. Another thing allinclusive drinks are awful. The smallest bottle of San Miguel beer that's gone in one mouthful & the same white wine every day!! No variety!! On the second last day of our holiday my son developed earache which I believe was due to untreated pool water. I never once saw any member of staff checking the water or taking a sample away. The night we landed home my son ended up in hospital with severe earache & has been off school ever since. My second child also developed it too & both are on antibiotics. Would I return to this hotel... Absolutely NOT.. even if I was offered free accommodation. The most disappointing holiday ever. And before I forget just to let allinclusive visitors know the bar staff ignore you as much as they can when they see you wearing a blue wristband.. Cash is king in this hotel !!

Kenzi Menara Palace,Paul C wrote a review May 2016,20,Certainly not a 5* Hotel,Just returned from a 8 night stay at Kenzi Menara Palace.  We choose this Hotel after reading all the good reviews on Trip Advisor so we thought it would be a good Hotel as we have never visited Morocco before.  Reception/Lobby area looked very nice as we entered & the check in was quick & easy.  Our room was nicely decorated & very spacious with a large bathroom but we were given a room with twin beds!  So we informed the front desk of this & they said that they would sort it outthat never happened.  It took 2 more days & 2 more visits to reception to finally get housekeeping to sort it out.Their solution was to put both single beds together!!  Also in the room we only had one coffee cup & no milk for the tea or coffee.  Another day we came back to our room to find that we had only been left 1 bath towel.  All these are minor issues but are very annoying as they are pretty basic requirements that you expect to be right for a 5 star Hotel.  As we were All Inclusive we thought it was strange that you could not eat at the pool bar until 3pm but you could eat there from 12.30pm if you paid for it.This is not All Inclusive as i know it.    Now for our biggest moan about this Hotel which nobody seems to mention on here..    BIRDS FLYING ABOUT IN THE BUFFET RESTAURANT.    On our first day we visited the buffet restaurant at lunch time.I sat down with my food & suddenly a bird crashed into the inside window sending feathers flying & narrowly missing my plate.This put us off straight away as we also saw the birds pecking at all the uncovered food in the buffet.NONE of the staff or management seemed bothered about this.  If you fancy eating in an Aviary then fair enough but if this was back in England then it would be a major concern for the Enviromental Health & they would soon close you down.& when choosing something to eat in there you often wondered if the birds had beaten you to the food!  We also found the quality of food in the buffet restaurant is very poorbland & not very warm.  Breakfast is not much better either after trying a raw omelette on our first morningthey could not even get that right & i ended up having cereals most mornings.  Because of our issue with the birds & the poor quality of food in the buffetwe ate in the Italian 5 nights out of the 8 & enjoyed all the meals in there as the food was always hot & cooked to order & the service by Noureddine was excellent.  During our stay there seemed to be a large amount of men in suits(management?) walking around doing nothing.also found many of the staff were not that friendly & quite miserable.  Hotel pianist & singer was cringe worthy but at least we always found the funny side of it.  We are not a fussy couple by any means but and we always look for positives rather than negatives & have gave a truely honest opinion of this Hotel & still cannot believe some of the reviews on here.  Would be go back?Definitely not.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulcC1061CR
Kenzi Menara Palace,cwfan wrote a review May 2016,30,"Beautiful, but... safety first",A large swimming pool (length 50 m) situated in a very nice garden.  Close to the airport. (10 min. drive). Very spacious rooms. Food is excelent. Staff is very friendly.  Unfortunately the large windows from the rooms on the backside of the hotel are in a terrible state: extra hooks had to be installed to keep them closed (and unwanted visitors out of the rooms).  Nevertheless so much space between the two windowpanes is left that all kinds of flying or crawling insects small ones and large ones (flies mosquitos.... ) can enter the rooms with no problem at all. You easily can put your fingers and hand between the panes !

Kenzi Menara Palace,lovetravellingx wrote a review May 2016,40,A great hotel with so much more potential,On arrival at the hotel we were very pleased to get our all inclusive bands given straight away although late arrival still had time to eat in the buffet restaurant.  The rooms are very spacious robes provided tea and coffee making facilities ( no milk) hairdryer and full length mirror. Lighting not great in the rooms-but better in bathroom.  Food was of a very good standard with plenty of choice the Italian restaurant in our opinion was much better than the Moroccan dont quite understand why there is an extra charge to use the Moroccan its not worth it especially because at least one night in the buffet there will be a Moroccan theme night.  The staff are excellent we found everyone to be extremely especially Hassan behind the bar . We even got smile out of the bar manager- probably because he is due to retire. The concierge- sherife is quite a charcter he speaks very good English and is very helpful if you need to go on trips or need a guide.  The pool an d outside bar area is very spacious never any problem getting a sunbed towels are provided.  So what could be better? there appeared to be a double standard as some of the guests were all inclusive and others weren't. So not all drinks are included surprisingly the local beer Casablanca is not included and you will have to pay extra for this premium spirits and some cocktails are also chargeable. I also noticed that some guests received waiter service during the day . Room service is only available between 12 and 6am. Outside of these times it is chargeable. The indoor pool is chargeble and the SPA treatments are on the pricey side. The gym is free and quite well equipped.  The weather was not great during our stay- we expected hot sun for the week but this didnt arrive until the last few days of our stay- weather very changeable- cloud cold wind and rain. The entertainment in the hotel is also very poor the hotel feels subdued no music other than a very mediocre piano player and a very droll singer. Together with the dull lighting you cant help feel this hotel needs an injection of life into it! There are no daytime activities plus the music at the pool bar was very disappointing. Its such a shame because the hotel is so spacious and has so much potential. it is however a very beautiful looking hotel with stunning views of the Atlas Mountains.  Venturing out of the hotel is an experience to say the least. Take advantage of the free shuttle bus but be prepared to 'run the gauntlet' In the square you will find the snake charmers- they will want your money- you will find ladies wearing burkas offering Henna tattoos- they will want your money - children will offer you directions even though you haven't asked and they too will want your money.  The streets are very narrow and maze like its very easy to get lost. The taxis however are good from the town to the hotel is 50 dirham. If 4 of you in a taxi it will be 100. ts not worth booking travel hopper to and from the airport it is much cheaper to get a taxi- airport is literally 10 mins away Even though we did not do the trip to the Atlas mountains we were told that this was worth the trip.  To end on a positive the day we checked out (12 noon ) the sun shone brightly and we were allowed to keep our all inclusive wrist bands until our departure.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovetravellingx

Kenzi Menara Palace,adampatel16 wrote a review May 2016,40,👍,We were given a warm welcome to Kenzi Menara Palace on arrival and shown to our room by a very delightful bell boy. Some Moroccan welcome treats were delivered to our room later that afternoon as well. The room itself was spacious. A large fitted wardrobe created a partition between the main hall and the bedroom. The bedroom opened up onto a balcony with great views of the garden. The bathroom contained two sinks (his & hers) a bathtub and separate shower. Toiletries such as lotions soaps and shower gel were provided (although I didn't use them). The rooms were cleaned and beds made up daily.    There was a cot in our room that we did not need and it got in the way. It took the entire day and several phone calls to reception for someone to come and remove it. We were told an extra bed was on its way (10mins) at check in but that also came a few hours later. The hotel ATM was out of order for the duration of our stay. The nearest one is at a shopping mall ~10mins away (walking) - near carrefour.    We opted for the all inclusive package and made the most of the restaurants on site. The buffet restaurant served a good selection of food for both vegetarians and those who eat meat. The menu varied from day to day so food didn't get boring. I felt that my diet was very balanced on most days which I guess is a good thing! This restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating. We also tried the Italian restaurant - a la carte. Food here was good too and came very well presented. The poolside bar was pleasant. Friendly bar staff relaxed atmosphere. The only snag was that food could only be ordered between 3-5pm or thereabouts. It would've been nice if the poolside bar served snacks throughout the day (e.g. nuts olives etc). I've been to all inclusive resorts where staff hand out snacks to people around the pool at all hours of the day - and they were always appreciated! The bar near reception have shisha but they only provide mint flavour and they took too long serving it in the evening.    The hotel grounds are beautiful and the pool is massive. Big pools always feel cold when the weather's hot but we felt fine once we'd taken the plunge. The smaller kids pool was a bit warmer and deep enough for a quick soak. On our first day it took almost an hour to get pool towels as they ran out/had to be washed. We didn't have this problem on any of the other days though.    We booked in for the promotional hammam + body massage at the hotel Spa - very refreshing!    The hotel shuttle service provides free lifts to and from Djema el Fna (the big square in the centre of Marrakech). Shuttle times are displayed at the reception desk.    Most of the staff were very friendly. There were a couple of language barriers as a few of them weren't fluent in English but I guess that's to be expected in Morocco.    Our cards kept on malfunctioning and had to be recoded several times during our stay. This wasn't a big deal as we had 3 cards between us and just got them redone as we passed the reception but I'm sure others would find this very frustrating.    The overall experience at Kenzi Menara was satisfying. There were a few minor mishaps but nothing major enough to cause any dissatisfaction. If I go back to Marrakech I may revisit this hotel.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Leicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adampatel16

Size of the rooms were ""massive"" TV Kettle and Mini Fridge etc. Everybody talk's about how the great service is from Cherif - ill be honest I think the guy is a waste of time. Tried to gain his attention and he fobbed me off. You try to get some further details about excursions etc.... - you might as well forget about it. The ladies behind the desk and main hotel manager were great. We were given a travel cot also for our son and also a ground floor room as we had a stroller. The Hotel manager sent some fruit/biscuits and bottled water. The exchange rate in this hotel was really really good - I exchanged most of my money here.  My son has a funny habit of having a bottle of milk at like 3am in the Morning the hotel provided a warm milk in a glass at like 3am in the morning - couldn't believe it and it was FREE - part of the service. I was really impressed.  The Pool was great even though it wasn't heated they do have a children's pool which is luke-warm.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Kayte W wrote a review May 2016,40,Gorgeous Hotel and Spa,We visited the hotel for part of my 40th birthday celebrations for a 4 night all inclusive visit. 4 ladies all looking for chilled out fun and a spot of culture thrown in for good measure.  First impressions of our hotel didn't disappoint and our joining rooms were clean spacious modern and totally fit for what we wanted.  If you are all inclusive even the room service and mini bar is free and there is never a time where you will be hungry or thirsty. The reception area is stunning and the pool is massive but due to our weather not being great (it hailstoned in May) the pool was freezing and would get the old heart beat racing!  We visited the spa on the rainy day and WOW!!!! Once you get over the cultural differences of not being as discreet or private as UK spas I have to say it was the BEST body scrub and full body massage I have ever had. I swear I lost that much skin I was lighter when leaving.  Food and drink in the hotel is nice breakfast basic but okay buffet is a mix of traditional Moroccan food and salads! Bar snacks are really nice and hit the spot after a few beers by the pool.  The ONLY downside of the hotel is some of the staff let it down! Even after tipping staff they sometimes make you feel like they are doing you a favour and don't seem to be as eager to serve you as they could.  They don't come across as very happy and this was only just the start of season so goodness knows what they will be like by July?  Don't get me wrong some are lovely and very professional but I would have given the hotel a 5 star if the staff would smile a bit more! Hope this doesn't come across as harsh but it's such a shame as the others work really hard and go out of there way for you they just need to find a happy balance.  Would definitely return again and can't wait to see the changes Marrakesh has to offer! I think in 5 years time it will compete with any city resort.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5kaytew
Kenzi Menara Palace,Reshma P wrote a review May 2016,10,Missy p,I stayed at the Kenzi Menara with a party of 10 for a short break. The hotel had badly trained staff who did not speak any English therefore communication was poor. Breakfast was shabby and staff unorganised. Food was served on chipped plates. Even teacups and glasses had chips. This is unhygienic. I would advise anyone travelling to this hotel that they ensure they take a travel iron This hotel did not offer an iron in any room grade. We discovered a dead cockroach in our bathroom. Upon complaining the desk staff were very unapologetic. I had to complain to the hotel manager before I was given a apology. We certainly will not be returning to this hotel and definitely grade this hotel below a 4 star.,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/660reshmap
Kenzi Menara Palace,Pella M wrote a review May 2016,50,Amazing courtesy extended to us,Long story- through no fault of Kenzi Menara our booking had been cancelled in error by an agent in Uk (we had no idea how complicated and layered the travel booking business is until this fateful day 5/5/16. The Kenzi Menara weren't in a position to honour our booking as they weren't going to get funds through and were fully booked by then at any rate. However they spent an entire day allowing us to use their phones to make international phone calls from their management offices to 3 parties in uk in order to try and resolve our issue.  Finally an agent in uk admitted culpability and we were given a new hotel (much lesser quality but that's another story).  The reason for this review is to give credit and convey thanks to ALL at the at Kenzi Menara Palace - in particular Fatima on reception who is an excellent linguist and beautiful human being El Mehdi Jniah who gave us his full attention and has the patience of a saint- your mother should be proud of you! (He even emailed me 2 days later to see how we were) and Chariff (aka Mr Obama) who had been busy elsewhere that morning but as soon as he arrived back at Kenzi sent us with a complimentary driver to our new hotel with a letter to the owner of our new hotel (which I did not use).

The pool guys would always supply you with a mattress and brolly. We were looking forward to meeting the concierge Cherif as we'd read so many good reviews. He speaks excellent English and arranged a trip for us to the Ourika Valley. He made sure we had a good car and driver. Abdul our driver also spoke good English and was very informative. He was a very safe driver and would take us to see whatever we wanted. We also took the hotel shuttle bus to the square which is free. This is a must as the atmosphere and souks are amazing. The evenings in the hotel are low key with a singer and keyboard player. We had a barbecue one evening which was lovely. All the staff were so helpful and friendly. Nouella(sorry about the spelling) even arranged a cake and birthday song for me which was so kind.

We chose Marrakesh instead of going a Canary Island as we wanted somewhere a bit more interesting. The hotel we first booked was the Kenzi Farah however after reading some reviews we opted for the Kenzi Menara Palace instead.We only stayed for 5 nights however i wish i had booked a week minimum. Good level of accommodation throughout the hotel and indeed the rooms- very spacious and of a high standard. We had a balcony room with a pool view- a must. Food again was of a very high standard- we dined in both the a la carte restaurants- both very good.The main buffet restaurant was also great as was the pool snack bar which we ate at most days. The only critisism was that the large pool was freezing- i assume they do not heat it out of season? The smaller pool however was great. We took advantage of the free shuttle bus which takes you into the main square where you will find the souks along with snake charmers etc- very lively but a must! Staff at the hotel were superb special mention to Fatimasara at front desk Cherif Concierge Hassan and Adil at the bar and Jebron and Adi the waiters. Lastly we also had Spa treatments which were great staff very good at what they do. We enjoyed it so much i have encouraged my parents to visit in May for a week of sunshine and exploring.

I went on a family holiday for 5 days and it has been quite a experience.  Please please please don't go by the reviews I am convinced the staff from the hotel write the reviews!    Negatives:  -poor service  -staff do not speak English so there is a language barrier  -during April the hotel has many shaded areas so gets cold  -pool is cold  -pool side restaurant has very limited options  -no pork (no club sandwich for me!)  -breakfast restaurant service is poor. Omelette chefs are miserable.  -need to pay tax on checking out. £10 per person.  -international restaurant is very expensive (day light robbery!)  -walls between adjoining rooms are thin hence can hear other guests (may as well invite them over!)  -no iron in the hotel given!! (Big issue when all your clothes are creased!!😡)  -room service menu is shabby! Again very few options.    Positives:  -hotel is 10mins from airport  -rooms are cleaned well  -plenty of cabanas to sit on by the pool    I hope this review helps you out.

Room was large airy and spotlessly clean. Not a fan generally of all inclusive - don't like buffets but thought it was an easy option - meal first night a few lunches and drinks made it worth it. in truth it was by far the best option the food was delicious and varied (moroccan / european / Chinese). there are 2 al a carte restaurants Italian (at no extra charge if all inclusive and Moroccan (100 dinar extra) which are a must. Instead of several night out we ate out of the hotel once for dinner and twice for lunch.  Staff speedy to help with any room issues - staff generally were friendly and helpful especially the bar and pool staff - a few flat faces in the restaurants!  Check out at 12am so if you have a late flight your options are pay 10 Euros an hour to extend your time in the room if it isn't booked for occupation later that day - this 10 Euros does not continue your all inclusive status - or check out and have use of the spa showers before your departure.  Cherief is the man to see for all your trips out he will organise private tours for you from a half day guided trip around the souks and medinas (recommended only if to stop constant hastle from store holders!) to full day trips into the Atlas mountains.

Breakfast was good and plentiful and we ate in the Moroccan restaurant which we both also enjoyed lunch by the pool was just standard food.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Shamaila Y wrote a review Apr 2016,40,"Beautiful hotel, great staff & service!",We stayed at the hotel a couple weeks ago or so and staged for a week. The transfer from the airport was approx 10 mins which was great! The hotel was in a great setting and had beautiful gardens all around.    The hotel was clean and the rooms were spacious. We came on a girls holiday and took our daughters with us they had a great time also.    The staff on the main reception desks were great sorry don't know the 2 men by name but we called them My Shy & Mr Lucky Sharif on the concierge was great with our excursions also.    A few improvements could be made:  A couple of staff in the bar didn't smile as much like they didn't want to be there. We found the service a little lacking in times.  Although the food was good It would have been nice to have a little more variety.    All in all a great hotel. We found the greatest asset for this hotel is the service given by the staff. We would not hesitate in recommending this hotel and hope yo come back soon.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Tamena Yousaf wrote a review Apr 2016,40,Great Service!!!,We went to this Hotel for a week the hotel staff were great service was great and the staff were friendly mainly the staff at reception concierge Sharif reception bar and pool bar staff. We were concerned about this hotel before going as the reviews were mixed. We would definitely recommend this hotel it was truly a hidden gem! The pool was beautiful and the beds aswell as the sun loungers were the best. I dont usually like sunbathing but these beds by the pool made me want to stay in the sun. The only improvements I would suggest is more variety of dishes in the buffets and better room cards as we occassionally had to walk back to reception to get the room cards sorted but we didnt let this spoil our holiday as reception staff were helpful. We tried the Italian ala carte which was truly fine dining so definitely pay it a visit during your stay. The moroccan al carte gives u an insight of moroccan food and culture we tried this on our last nite and the drummers were also a great touch. Occassionally the hotel would do barbecues at lunch this was great as it gives you the option to vary your food. Pool bar: they had great burgers kebabs and the ice cream was nice in particular pistachio! As we got this holiday at a lower price than what we would usually spend we were worried but i would say this hotel is good value for money. The gardens in the hotel were as nice as what we read in the reviews it was great to burn off the food with a stroll in the gardens as we were were all inclusive. We went on a hot air balloon as an excursion definitely ask about this as it is a great experience and dont let the drive to venue freak you out the excursion is safe and the flight staff made it very enjoyable for us.

Kenzi Menara Palace,The_Siads_on_holiday wrote a review Apr 2016,20,Definitely not a high end hotel,We visited this hotel for 3 nights initially I was really impressed as the rooms were huge with 2 large balconies and a spacious bathroom. However as time went on I couldn't wait to leave.    The pros:  Huge rooms we had a family room so had a sitting room and a bedroom with one large bathroom and another smaller toilet and sink and 2 large balconies    The cons:  The wifi is terrible we literally only got it if we sat on a particular seat in the living room.  The breakfast is poor it all seemed very congested and the waiters are also very occupied all the times.  Throughout the hotel the staff are not very welcoming or friendly we were leaving at 6:00am and breakfast starts at 6:30am so we enquired if they have any earlier breakfast for those checking out to which we got a blunt reply 'just order room service and pay for it'. This did seem very rude!  Majority of the staff do not understand English for example we called housekeeping for a mop one lady answered and passed it on to another lady who said 'sure coming' and we didn't ever receive the mop.  The main issue I had with this hotel was their spa. They heavily advertise their spa as one of the best so we thought we had to give it a try. My husband called to book a massage for the both of us again here the lady didn't understand him well so didn't enquire about type of massage or anything but just booked it for us. So we turned up for our massage earlier than the time as we usually do at any spa however this place was very different. There's no meet and greet there's no welcome drink there's no medical questionnaire. Rather what you get is staff shouting at each other taking you into a dark room with no instructions about what to do. The ladies talking to each other during the massage keep in mind we have no idea what massage they are actually doing or even who they are. One of the ladies going on her phone whilst massaging and then to top things off they covered our eyes and just left without even telling us the massage was over and left us in the dark. It was the worse spa experience I have ever had and we travel to many 5 star resorts and always use the spa. When we went to check out I enquired how to make a complaint and was told I need to do so in writing which I did until today (2 weeks later) I am yet to hear back from the hotel!!    Travel tips for those visiting:  DO NOT waste your money on the spa  There is a shopping centre about a 10 minute walk for your drinks and food  We booked an outing with the concierge to the ourika valley mountains the price was really reasonable and you get your own private car with English speaking driver which was great    People to thank:  Abdulah in concierge was very welcoming when he took us to our room and cherif also in concierge was very helpful in sorting out our trip to the mountains.    All in all I wouldn't recommend this hotel to others and I certainly will not be going back to this hotel....,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The_Siads_on_holiday

Kenzi Menara Palace,freida_moore wrote a review Apr 2016,40,Great hotel in convenient location,We stayed for 4 nights and had a wonderful time. Booked through BA as a holiday package and ended up with a huge junior suite - a lovely sitting room and then huge master bedroom.    Lovely huge pool - which unfortunately was freezing cold - and then another smaller children's pool which was warmer.    We weren't all inclusive but we did have an amazing Moroccan buffet on our first night. A great way to sample a selection of local foods. After this we are in or around the main town square. We ate a couple of times at the pool bar. Food was good and the service was OK.    Mini bus into the square was great - we always made it on to the one we needed but we did need to make sure that we were waiting early. It was busy so maybe a tip for the hotel would be to put an extra service on during the school holidays.    The last morning it was very busy at breakfast with no tables free. But the team fixed this by opening the Italian restaurant so no waiting was required - great service!    The only complaint I would have is that none of the movies were working (and no apology from the staff). After a pretty full on day with the children we were ready to all relax and watch something. Unfortunately nothing was working and with no English channels so it was hard to entertain the children and relax together.    We also had no trouble with the wifi at the hotel and it was easy to access with multiple devices - great for a family!,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/freida_moore

Just as everyone else has said the thing that makes this place so memorable is the staff. On arrival we were welcomed by a lovely young lady who upgraded us to a lovely room as the view from our original room was not great. There were issues - the air/con not working but these were quickly resolved. The food is amazing and the rooms are large and very well appointed. Our fridge was always stocked up with cold drinks and water and we had fresh towels daily. The Italian restaurant serves the most amazing food and I could have eaten here every night. We had a wonderful trip to the Atlas Mountains that Cherif recommended and it did not disappoint. The driver Hassan was friendly and went out of his way to make our day interesting. I must also thank Mohamed Moussaid who was there for us every day and happy to help with anything. It's not fair to name just a few staff as they are all wonderful but I think that Mohammed and Cherif deserve a special mention.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rensehgal

He kindly upgraded us to a suite located nearer my parents room and negotiated a better rate for half board. Toufeek really understood customer service well and is a real asset to the hotel.    The hotel was excellent and have to say the service from everyone was excellent. Highly recommend.

Kenzi Menara Palace,johnpetersfield wrote a review Mar 2016,40,Excellent Hotel to stay for Golf,Our 2nd stay at the Palace as a base for playing golf. It is ideal for this purpose as you can have a lovely buffet breakfast before you play and a great light lunch when you return and relax by the pool. The only downside from last year is that the buffet evening meal main course selection was very poor. So poor in fact that we decided to eat at the Italian restaurant. The quality of food and service here over 4 nights was exceptional  The rooms are still fantastic (always ask for a pool view room) well appointed and spacious for 2 people. I had hoped that there might be milk in the fridge this year for coffee but my hopes were dashed !  The service at this hotel is superb especially reception room an porterage services. Everything is done with a smile.  So all in all I think this is probably still the best place to stay in Marrakech if you are playing golf. All the good courses are within a 30 minute drive and the staff of the Menara palace go out of their way to make sure everything runs smoothly.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Hayling Island, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/j0hnhayling
Kenzi Menara Palace,Dwade15 wrote a review Mar 2016,30,Great hotel but one bad apple!!,Stayed for 03 nights and had a great time in the hotel. The location is great and the hotel decor is nice.    I would have given this review a 5 star but because one of the reception staff (Adil) was unpleasant and almost ruined my stay I think you lucky to get a 03 star from me.    He was very cold and direct and looked a very unhappy man. We dealt with him for the first time on my first day. I needed to change some foreign currency and he refused to give us a receipt.  After insisting for a receipt he angrily took a luggage tag( see picture attached) and wrote manually the transaction and gave it back to me. I did not accept this as a receipt and angrily he said to come back the next day ?? It's completely illegal practice not to give a customer an official receipt for a foreign currency exchange. The management need to take action in regards to this.    Had to deal with him (Adil) again upon check out and he did not ask us if we had a nice stay or invited us to come back. I think he's killing all the hard work that the team is trying to create in this great hotel.    Cherif from the concierge was fantastic !!

All inclusive    I booked Kenzi Menara Palace because of their excellent feedback on Trip advisor and the consistently high comments. We weren’t disappointed.    After booking I was very impressed by the attentive and responsive email replies from Jalia Ait Moumen in the sales team who looked after all my requests and chances as the date approached.    Cherif in Concierge looked after the day to day requirements of all the group and organised a few tours etc. True professional.    The housekeeping standards were again very high and all guests felt comfortable and pampered within the rooms division.    The excellent team in Food and Beverage department looked after each and every guest with great service at every meal and beverage time.  Particular thanks goes to Mohamed Moussaid Food and Beverage Director. A true professional and a manager with a great eye for detail.  Also to Abderrahim Haur who when on duty you always felt secure that he had my best interests at heart and nothing was a problem for him.  The chef and his team produced great food choice three times a day. Always fresh tasty and with enough varication to suit all pallets.    The hotel offer a free minibus shuttle service in and out of town. It was well used by the group. While the souks etc are a must to visit. We all looked forward to returning to the luxury of the hotel.    I know I speak for all my 28 guests when I say a very well done to the KMP. You truly made their stay memorable and for sure you will have many return guests.  Thank you and look forward to seeing you soon.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Miscara wrote a review Mar 2016,50,"Indulgent, spacious, best customer service and fab tours",This was my second time at Kenzi Menara . I wanted something special for my Dads 70th birthday you see.  I knew it was going to be lovely for my parents but I had actually forgotten just how great this place is.    Although not in the heart of Marrakech it is only a 5 minute drive (they provide shuttles to and from the medina) and after a hard day wandering the souks bartering your way around (everywhere) it is such a welcome place to come home to escape the madness the chaos noise and bustle of the city.    The rooms are huge and indulgent (the bathrooms so huge half of my own flat would fit into it!) and have lovely big balconies and views of the beautifully maintained gardens pool and/or the awesome Atlas Mountains.    There is a colossal amount of space in this hotel and the main foyer has many areas to chill out with some lovely Moroccan mint tea in big velvety chairs or to look out over the gardens with a book in different coloured nooks. Everywhere you turn is another delightful experience.    Their customer service is impeccable and they really truly make every single effort to make your stay as great an experience as possible- but it doesn't end at the hotel- whether its organising a tour (highly recommend- you can even tailor make your own via their excellent guides) or suggesting perfect restaurants for your mood they always got it spot on.    I met Shareef when I was first there. He is the concierge and am amazingly warm happy fellow. He leads the way and is for me the heart of this hotel. It is clear how all the staff look up to this man and he is an inspiration to all (which is always nice to see)!  Speak to him regarding your tour needs. Nothing is too much trouble and everything can be catered for.    We went quad biking one morning and on another day did a trip to the Atlas Mountains with our bespoke tour to include a stop off at a Berber village (going in for tea and homemade bread); We wanted to stop at some stunning viewpoints an Argan Oil factory and to have lunch in one of the many cafes that are alongside (and many of them actually IN) the river en route to the mountains...    The breakfasts have everything you could possibly want from hot to cold fruit to cereal to cakes to soups to cooked breakfasts.  There are a couple of resturants to chose from for lunch and dinner. We ate at the buffet one night which was nice. Lots of choice and again hot or cold and abundant...    They also have a spa which my folks used and enjoyed. I had a Hammam which was just brilliant . Treat yourself!    The pool area is grand (2 pools) and sectioned so you can still find areas to sit tucked away in big king size sun loungers for two or beds by the pool with stunning scents of jasmine and beautiful pink lush plants all around you.    Lay here look at the sky the colours and lose yourself. It really is a special place and I loved returning here. My parents (who are slightly nervous travelers) are already talking about their return!

We felt like royalty from the minute we walked in until the minute we left. There is not one member of staff at this hotel who would not go out of their way to help you. We were all inclusive and it was quite literally ALL inclusive - I sometimes expect to have to pay for bar snacks or certain food/drink outside certain times but we didn't pay for anything at the hotel except for today we went to the spa to make use of the pool and a Hamman which was again amazing.    If you are unsure of whether you should stay here or not please just do it. You will not be disappointed. Those who have left anything short of 5 stars really have been clutching at straws to find even the tiniest thing wrong. If I had to say one thing that let it down it would actually have been some of the guests holding themselves in such pretence forgetting even basic manners when speaking to the staff I was sometimes embarrassed that fellow Brits were so rude. Don't let that put you off you can ignore them.  Overall 5 stars. would give 6 if I could.

However I still didn't have a clue what I was doing was all too quick.    My room was impressive clean spacious and a huge (rock hard) Bed. Movies on the telly didn't work and the toilet dribbled water all day and night but on the whole a nice room.    Food wise (the let down) - breakfast had a small selection and was often cold evening meal was a lot of the same (cold and little selection). That said I chose to eat in the Italian restaurant one night and the food there was very impressive.    The service from the hotel was OK but not outstanding in my opinion. You are never made to feel like the main priority - however a lot of that may come from cultural differences. However when you are talking to a member of staff and they answer their phone or have a laugh and a joke with their colleagues I find that some what disrespectful.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Leanne1968 wrote a review Mar 2016,50,Excellent resort.,My wife wrote a review giving this resort 3 stars due to service. Since it was published Mohammed the service manager approached us and discussed said issues. The difference has been terrific. In future we will go directly to the management and give them the opportunity to respond & rectify before writing a review. Our stay has been wonderful since & we would have no hesitation returning for a relaxing break in peaceful surroundings. I'd reiterate the food has been terrific & the Moroccan restaurant is very authentic.

Kenzi Menara Palace,scott k wrote a review Mar 2016,50,Mr & Mrs Scotts Honeymoon!,"We visited the Kenzi Menara Palace the first week of March for our honeymoon. We've never been to Morroco to be honest we've never had any desire to. Basically we wanted some guaranteed winter sun.  We were toying with the idea of staying either here or a place over on the coast at Essaouira. After reading all the reviews it was the constant mention of the concierge Cherif that tipped the balance for us. We figured if the rest of the staff were half as good as this guy seemed to be then we'd be fine. Wow!!! We are so glad we chose the Kenzi Menara Palace!!  We entered the impressive lobby and waited briefly as a member of the reception team was serving another guest. A smart gentleman immediately came over and politely asked in French if we were being attended to. He introduced himself as ""Cherif"". Hallelujah!! He actually exists!! ""Mr Scott so happy to have you and your wife stay with us"".  Whilst filling out the check-in forms Cherif gave us the usual concierge spiel about ""anything we can do to make your holiday more enjoyable..."" Difference is here it's not spiel.  We said that we were actually on honeymoon having got married two days previous. With that his face lit up he gratulated us both and asked if we'd eaten (it was about 12.10pm). He bundled the forms together unfinished and said we should eat forms can wait!  After lunch Cherif met us in the lobby I mentioned we had our marriage certificate with us should they need to see it (someone reviewed saying they had to book separate rooms without proof they were married) he was gobsmacked they don't......  He then introduced the management team to us all very warm chatty and welcoming.  We had booked for a standard double room with garden view but we were given an upgrade to a suite as a wedding gift complements of the hotel........  I'm sure we'd have been quite happy with what we'd booked but oh my days!! Wow!! This was the size of a small apartment!! The suite opens into the opulent living area small w/c sink minibar sofas chairs tv writing desk with sliding doors to an enclosed balcony. Then through to the dressing area two wardrobes safe coffee facilities with large bathroom to one side containing shower bath twin sinks w/c and bidet fresh towels and robes daily slippers. Bedroom to the other side is huge! Sofa chair tv desk crisp linen sprinkled with fresh rose petals (daily) and decorated with towels shaped as swans depicting a heart shape. Then sliding doors to a smaller balcony.  We were left open mouthed....This doesn't happen to us.....""have they mixed us up with another guest???"" ""I'm just Scott Kelly not ""astronaut"" Scott Kelly.""  Then there was a knock at the door a maid had brought us a massive bowl of fruit and welcome cakes. Very thoughtful.  That night we were sent a lovely bottle of wine on ice and some beautiful deserts with ""Happy Married"" decorated on them. We'd only asked if it was ok for us to take our drinks from the bar to our room. Again a lovely gesture.  We made friends with a lovely couple and went to dine in the Italian restaurant one evening and the waiter asked quite politely if we'd made a reservation. We hadn't but one of the management team Jamal (I think) interrupted ""no need special guests.""  That summed up the tone for the week everyone made us feel very special in a sincere way not a ""it's my job"" way.  The food was delicious especially the tagines and the Italian restaurant staff attentive and chatty facilities were great pools very clean although cold (hey it is their winter) but were fine after a minute or two sun loungers very comfy especially the four poster ones and fresh bathing towels every day. Wifi generally good as we didn't stream films etc. My wife had an ""O Spa"" massage package and said it was fantastic and was the only thing added to the bill. Free shuttle to the Jamaa el Fna square is great and if you go late evening playing Frogger(crossyroad) to get a cheap cab back is an experience!  I know I sound like a mouthpiece for the hotel but I don't care! I am really struggling to find something negative to write. Some of the poor reviews I've read seem to be by people who have a p.a. and can't do anything for themselves. In fact she probably did the review for them. Ok the films didn't work on our tv (so insignificant I didn't even mention it to staff may have just been ours) tea would've been nice in room rather than just coffee tea and coffee at breakfast could've been hotter as went cold quickly we tended to take our own glasses to the bars when getting another drink out of courtesy rather than staff being slow to be fair it was nice not to be hassled every two mins. I read somewhere about a couple being served mint tea when they asked for a third glass of wine???? Can only speak for ourselves but we had more than a few nights at the bar until midnight still chatting with friends and the staff and never had problems being served......Maybe it's the old thing of ""Treating people as you'd wish to be treated"" it works for us.  Special mentions to Jamal?(Manager) Badr(reception) Dounia(pool bar lovely girl) Fatima-Zarah(reception lovely girl) and Hassan(pool bar). That's not to say the other staff weren't all great and friendly they were.  Finally a big thank you to Cherif a proper gent. Speaking to him on a daily basis about anything from each other's families work travels etc to trips he went out of his way to help was engaging interested and interesting. You sir are welcome at ours the next time you visit England for sure.  We would recommend Marrakech and the Kenzi Menara Palace to anyone it exceeded all of our expectations and we have some fantastic memories there! We will be back for certain!

Yassin on the front desk deserves a special mention he was excellent throughout the duration of our stay.    We arrived at the hotel at 10pm and we were checked in very quickly to allow us to make it for dinner on time.    The breakfast ran up until 10.30am which allowed us to sleep in most days. Food in general was excellent    The pool was not heated which would have been nice.    Aside from that everything was great.

Kenzi Menara Palace,leanne1812 wrote a review Mar 2016,30,"Nice resort, not outstanding.",I'm staying here now and I can only agree with the previous reviewer. I thought choosing the Sentido brand would mean a great holiday experience. There's nothing hugely wrong just quite a few little niggles that in a 5* resort are not good enough. The service is a bit of a let down. We've sat at the small pool the last 2 days and when we've ordered drinks the empty glasses have sat until we have returned them ourselves to the bar. The resort is not what I'd call busy and the staff at the pool bar are not rushed so I don't know why this is happening. Being attentive to guests should be paramount. Also when returning for another drink the staff may well just refill the same glass. Not good practise.    In the main dining area it's a little chaotic in the morning. I can see the staff are busy and trying their best but perhaps delegating certain staff to re-setting tables and others dealing with tea/coffee may be a more effective way of organising. In the evenings I've noticed no dessert cutlery at all and salt & pepper pots aren't on every table. Little things I know but in a luxury hotel guests shouldn't have to go & take salt from another table & find cutlery.    In the bar it is table service but after our first drink which we ordered ourselves & took to our table no one volunteered another. Nor were we given snacks like some tables. It's inconsistencies like this guests pick up on. I'm not sure if our all-inc bands are singling us out but it appears that way with the table service. All-inc or not we have paid just as any other guests have.    I requested an iron for my husband but was told it's a service only. Because of health & safety we cannot have one in our room. Something to bear in mind if you don't like creased clothes. This is not something I've ever encountered for an adult to be denied access to ironing their own clothes seems ludicrous.    Now for the positives. The room is spacious & clean with a great pool view. Reception staff have been helpful & friendly as has concierge. The free shuttle is an excellent service & the food has been very good. There's a good selection with a Moroccan/French theme which suits our tastes. Those looking for a more British feel might not think the same.    The grounds are pretty & well manicured and there are plenty of sunbeds & day beds. The pools are very clean although only one person has ventured further than dipping toes as even the small pool is freezing!    Free wi-fi is always good and the connection has been mostly solid.    Would I return? Possibly but I'd like to know these issues have been improved.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leanne1812
Kenzi Menara Palace,HelenNess wrote a review Mar 2016,30,Second visit - slightly disappointed,This was our second visit to this hotel we emailed hotel asking for a taxi to collect us at airport but this did not happen. We paid for a pool view all inclusive after a 15 minute wait at check in were advised hotel was full and no pool view available but we were given a suite with a garden view. Was on the ground floor and the noise from the room above was loud Internet or free wifi was so much slower than last year and at times did not work at all. Service in dining room was rather slow especially at breakfast with tea and coffee many guests just went and helped themselves finding a table that was clean with napkin and cutlary proved near impossible on most mornings. The birds flying around the dining room and their droppings were mainly ignored by staff. In the evenings we had to ask every night for salt & pepper as not on every table. Food was fine and we always managed to find food to our liking. The all inclusive drinks on offer were very limited with only a choice of 4 cocktails very basic  local spirits beer  soft drinks and wine. Pool snack bar is excellent and great friendly service free shuttle is also very good. Our room keys deactivated 4 times which was annoying. Pool is lovely but not heated and freezing.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Phil C wrote a review Mar 2016,20,It Staying for Business Find Another Property,This hotel just does not get it they can't understand why as a business traveler you would need internet speed that goes faster than 2.0 mbps. The speed is so bad that you are not able to connect to most mail services. The management team first tells you that they have the IT department address then they come to your room and stay it's your room location (not my issue all rooms should get wireless) next they tell you it's an issue with the entire city (not turn business center was running at 8 mbps) my LTE phone was running at 26 mbps.    Actually I was attending a conference and everyone had the same issue. This property needs to spend less time making excuses why the service is not working and fix the problem!    I would have given this property a 3 rating rooms are OK they need maintenance shower drain is slow water runs all over the floor they must have notice everyday they serviced the room but was not addressed. Back slider locks do NOT work (was on the first floor) I inquired and they stated they have never had thief issues so no worries how about fixing the issue and addressing my concern???

Very nice hotel nice room with swimming pool view: clean big (family room) and quite. Hotel staff is very kind and professional. Position of the hotel is good too: 15min with hotel shuttle bus to Place El Fanaa (Marrakech center) very closer to the Palmerie boulevard and easy to get out of Marrakech from the hotel (going to mountains etc.).  When the weather is not so good it is difficult for you to manage your kids inside the hotel: the mini-park is really “mini” with very few activities only and the internal swimming pool is not adapted for kids (but the hotel authorized kids to use it as normally is a part of SPA only).

We stayed on the all inclusive option plenty of choice in the buffet restaurant with options to eat in the Italian and Moroccan restaurants in the evening and the pool bar at lunch. The all inclusive drinks option was good and we enjoyed the Moroccan wines and beers. The rooms were comfortable and the whole hotel and grounds well maintained.  The staff were very friendly particularly Cherif the concierge and Hasan the barman. Cherif was very knowledgeable and arranged a couple of trips to the city sites and the Atlas Mountains he seemed to be involved in everything even arranging our late checkout. The hotel was well sited at about 15 minute drive from the airport and the same into the city. The free shuttle bus had its last trip at 7pm during our stay but the taxis ride back relatively inexpensive. The location of the hotel also provided a calm retreat from the hustle and bustle inside the city walls. The hotel was quiet during our stay but based on our experience would defiantly recommend here if you are looking for an all inclusive hotel.,Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bexhill-on-Sea, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alanv947

We had the room with pool view booked great for mornings as it's nice walking out through the glass doors onto the garden to the pool. Our bedroom was a really large and spacious-they decorated our room with fresh rose petals. The downside was that the outside pool was very cold so we could not use it but we had enough sun to use the loungers it was great!  There was plenty of choice for breakfast each morning and the choice of restaurants in the hotel was from Morocco to italian. Hotel staff were friendly and it was so handy that they had a free shuttle taxi that went to the medina square- we used this a lot!  We met one lovely staff member of the concierge team his name was Cherif he was extremely helpful and spoke excellent English and many english dialects very humorous. Upon his recommendations we visited Kasbah Tamadot (Richard Bransons retreat) had a walking tour on the Atlas mountains we watched Fantasia which is a live show that' takes place late evening with dancers food and horse riding. Cherif also very kindly took us to the kotoubia mosque for Friday prayers and organised private pickups and drop off to the airport.  We loved the medina it was so busy you can pick up great bargains freshly squeezed orange juice and an array of food.  We also had a hammam and massage each and used the in house spa facilities it was so relaxing -make use of the indoor pool. It is warm.  If you are visiting first time I would highly recommend that you visit the suggested places above. We will definitely be returning back.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Julie F wrote a review Jan 2016,50,Palatial premises,We agree with the majority of reviews that applaud the scope of the complex and efforts of the staff. I would just mention that this large hotel is on the edge of Marrakesh and requires a bus to get you to the medina - the last free bus runs at 7.15 from the square. This means you are restricted to the more pricey hotel offerings unless you want to pay for a taxi - easily done and not a problem if you want to stay in the hotel at night. We preferred to be in the inner city so felt a bit distant compared to ryads we had stayed in at other Moroccan cities. Not a problem if you are already aware. Also no iron in the room for a quick press - you have to use the 'service'. So while the room appears to be great value for money we spent a fair bit finally on taxis food drinks and laundry.,Date of stay: January 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Melbourne, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulieF784

All the staff are friendly and helpful but I must mention a particular gentleman who works at the front of reception named Sharif. He goes above and beyond his job to make sure all the guests are kept smiling throughout their stay. He pointed me in the right direction to get involved in a local run and made me feel more than welcome with the locals. Not to mention his fantastic English accent!!

Kenzi Menara Palace,JessDnomad wrote a review Jan 2016,10,"Avoid at all cost, non existent service","Booked and prepaid this so-called 5* hotel for 3 nights as part of my hotel reviews trip in Morocco. Very bad customer service extremely rude staff non existent problem resolution i will not recommend it at all. At all.  1. booking process: nothing in the booking phase stated what kind of documents to bring. We checked in at midnight after very long flight and were denied check in as they said we needed to bring marriage certificate. None of us lived in morocco my spouse is moroccan but left the country when was teenager and still single. So none of us knew this as no info was given to us during booking but they said with condecending talk that ""Everybody knows it"". Yea right dont expect people to know if nothing clearly stated beforehand.  2. Ridiculous problem resolution. Even after giving evidence of spousal visa/sponsor documents that clearly stated our marriage status the receptionist still refused and said that legal government document was not valid (seriously???). When we asked to talk to manager in charge they said no manager worked at night. I review hundreds mid-high end hotels each year and that was the first time i heard such silly answer. The receptionist (Abdurrahman if im not mistaken) was extremely rude didnt even want to speak to me only spoke to my husband as he said ""He can speak moroccan"" talked nonstop not giving us chance to explain. We were very tired and just wanted to rest and explained that due to time difference we would contact our family in the morning to send whatever thing they need. But no the only solution they gave was we had to book 2 separate rooms. So basically regardless of your marriage status you can bring as many opposite gender as possible and do whatever as long as you book multiple rooms. Very embarassing marketing effort to say the least.  We got enough of that rubbish talk left and checked in to nearby Le Meridien and had fantastic stay there.  The next morning somehow the management from Kenzi called me at Le Meridien but the damaged has been done.  There are so many high end hotels in the area the single most important factor is service standard which in this hotel was non existent.  I would not recommend this hotel at any cost.",Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled on business,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessDnomad

Kenzi Menara Palace,Farah R wrote a review Jan 2016,40,A nice hotel with friendly staff,The hotel is situated in 'new Marrakech' approximately a 10 minute drive from the airport. On our arrival we were given some signature Moroccan mint tea by Samiha who was very helpful in answering all my questions. We also had to fill out a form.  Concierge were always around to help and the hotel had taxis in the car park - as well as their own shuttle bus going to Jemma el Fnaa at certain times during the day.  The gym contained decent equipment for both weights and cardio workouts (matrix and concept 2 branded) with a decent sized studio room opposite. The opening times were between 9am and 8pm - I'd have preferred the gym to be open earlier/close later personally.  There were also both indoor and outdoor pools along with a sauna.  With regards to the spa the hammam was very good as was the back massage (thanks Emaan!)  We had booked (for 5 nights) a deluxe room with a garden view and terrace. It was big the decor was modern yet it still had an authentic Moroccan feel to it. Towels were replaced daily and rooms were cleaned to a good standard. Wifi was accessible at all points in the hotel.  The breakfast catered for people of all nationalities with a range of pastries cereals Mediterranean style breakfast and English breakfast.  Security was at a high which of course is a huge plus point for anybody - all vehicles coming into the hotel were device monitored the boot/trunk of a car was checked etc.  Marrakech is a relatively safe city and the locals are very friendly and helpful.  However my sister and I were actually followed by a man in Al Mazar mall which is a short walk away from the hotel. I even got hit on by a policeman - hence it is a peace of mind knowing that security is tight at Kenzi Menara.  When checking out we were given a bill for local taxes - I was made aware of incurring such charges when booking.  I'd say the downside of this hotel is that the rooms do not have an iron which is essential. With that aside it is still a very good hotel and the views of the Atlas Mountains surrounding it is pretty special.  Also an extra thanks to Hassan who set up an amazing shisha for me!,Date of stay: January 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Gloucestershire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FarahRentiya

Wanted a couple chilled out days away from London and we got it. Not a 5* by international standards but good value for money.    We were checked in by who I must assume was the manager (Nour Eddine...thank you!!)--upgraded our room which was a bonus 😄    Rooms: the suite was very nice spacious and clean (smelt great in fact the whole hotel smelt good). Bed and pillows also good quality...bed was huge big plus for me at 1m95! Only draw back for me with the room was the shower pressure--not the best 👍🏾    Staff: overall they were really great front of house concierge spa staff...warm and friendly 👍🏾    Spa: massage was very good for the price (~£50 for 50mins) and the indoor pool was quiet and relaxing 👍🏾    Restaurant: the weak link in stay. Was not impressed by the buffet lunch or buffet breakfasts we had. We ate out for most meals so didn't present a huge problem overall 👎🏾    Very satisfied with our stay...only draw backs I would say were breakfast (thought the cooked food was below average) shower water pressure and the internet was very slow--especially compared to some restaurants I got access in.,Date of stay: January 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JRNTL

Rooms are space full and well decorated. try to go for a pool view.  This is the second time we travel to Marrakech and the first time we were disappointed that we didn't receive local dishes at the hotel. Well here you can fall any better if you like local dishes. Every day new tajines which are very well prepared.  And the desserts man you have a full dinner with only desserts (these are not really local by the way). Their lemon pie is amazing and you would kill for.  The staff is always available for any of your desires.  The new year evening was well organised with music and dances. Downside was the volume of the music and the temperature of the food (too cold). But it was a very pleasant evening. Photo's available the day after for only 2 euro's.  On jan 1st a brunch was organised next to swimming pool and what do you think? Best couscous ever again mixed with some local musicians.    We would like to express our special thanks to Mohammed who is in charge of the restaurant during break fast and lunch. He is a very special person who is available with a smile for every tourist.

Checked into the hotel and the reception made sure we had everything sorted before going to the rooms we got allocated.  The rooms are spacious and the room service people were very helpful.  Only downside i would say is the breakfast is okay but could be better as there is not much variety.  Pool side at the rear is brilliant but pool itself is cold(really).  Mr Cherif organised the excursions and transport from the airport to the hotel and hotel back to airport. The guy is a gentleman and would recommend anyone going to the hotel to speak to him if they had any problems. He is a very busy man but still has time to stand and talk.  There is also free shuttle bus that goes from the hotel to the main square in the old town that again is very helpful and save money.

Kenzi Menara Palace,radclife wrote a review Dec 2015,50,Heavenly,I was wow'd by this hotel and that was only on the approach! Beautiful gardens and a grand entrance. Large airy reception area which felt opulent. A few little shops in the lobby and the prices were very reasonable for last minute gifts. Check in was efficient and staff very personable.    First time I'd stayed in an all-inclusive and I found it was excellent. I arrived late night and being able to order a hot meal to my room was very much appreciated.    My room was massive and being on the corner I had 2 balconies one of which overlooked the pool. I was thoroughly impressed by my bedroom and a very grand bathroom. There was even a phone in the loo! Rooms were immaculate mini bar was restocked daily and offered excellent storage space.    Travelling on my own killing time in the evening before going out can be a bit boring - there's only so much CNN news i can take. Not in this hotel though - there was an abundance of channels and films without charge.    The pool bar/restaurant offered a good choice of drinks and light meals. Alternatively you could have a buffet lunch in the main restaurant. The buffet was plentiful and I never tired of the choice. The desserts were incredible my only regret was that I didn't bring my gym gear to work them all off. The restaurant worked hard to please and were friendly and professional. The company of the little birds that flew in and out of the restaurant were entertaining rather than annoying.    Evening meals were either buffet in the main restaurant or you could opt to eat in one of the specialist restaurants once during your stay. I tried the Italian. Staff were attentive however I found the menu choice limited. That said I may just have been spoiled by the abundance of food the main restaurant offered!    The main pool was big if a little cold however the weather was bordering 40 degrees on most days so the pool was a welcome cool down. The animation man was so friendly without being intrusive. Though there were some activities during the day not so many that you felt you were in Butlins. The smaller pool was quiet and tranquil. Plenty of sunbeds and I loved the four poster ones; all came with big chunky mattresses and free beach towels (which you get from the side of the pool bar).    I took advantage of the free shuttle into Marrakech which was very efficient. On my first day concierge booked a guide to take me around the souks which was a great introduction. As a single female my experience of Marrakech was very positive; people were friendly and helpful. Enthusiastic market sellers and others responded well to a polite no when I didn't want to buy anything. In short I love this city.    I would like to thank everyone at the Kenzi Menara Palace for making my holiday so wonderful. Staff work so hard pay attention to detail and I've recommended this hotel to my family/friends as it is such a special place.,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/radclife
Kenzi Menara Palace,Andrew B wrote a review Dec 2015,40,Some Winter Sun,My wife and I took a week off (15 to 22 Nov) to go to the Kenzi Menara Palace in Marrakech we both needed a break and some sunshine.    The flight was good and we were soon landing in Marrakech the hotel is not too far from the airport I thought that might be a problem but there only seemed to be 3 or 4 planes a day and they were modern and quiet.    The hotel gave a good welcome it was neat and tidy and very clean with an army of smartly dressed ladies cleaning everything they too always smiled and were polite and helpful.    There was no language problem as most staff speak English French and Arabic I was able to practise my French.    I thought the food was very good always a good variety of things to chose from the desserts were tremendous. If you get bored with the normal restaurant there are two others to chose from and the Pool Bar.    The Concierge Sharif was very helpful and I scored a few points with the misses when he arranged three trips for me in the week good value and in the hotels' new Mercedes cars with knowledgeable and kindly guides. lots of photo opportunities and experiences.    When we weren't on the trips my wife enjoyed the sun and got a good tan with rays that don't burn they just keep you warm and add that glow (that she wanted). although the pool was cold/ very clean/ but cold.    The pool bar served meals and drinks Zak checked on us regularly and offered me a game of ping pong other staff were efficient happy and smiled. There were lots of sparrows squeaking about they were such little characters great to see we fed them crumbs.    Our room was good the bed was huge two doubles nice bath-room shower etc..clean and tidy and a free soft drink mini-bar.    The gym and sauna/spa were ok gym equipment was good quality but seemed like it needed some maintenance to make it work properly    Downsides were that the doors don't self close so there was sometimes noise from people shutting doors lighting is a bit dull and the tv wasn't showing any films but on the plus side the wifi signal was brilliant and good enough to stream films (in our room).    Other negatives were that dinner wasn't until nearly 8pm which is a bit late for me getting a cup of coffee at breakfast was a bit of a struggle waiters were cheerful but a bit too busy to always meet everyone's needs (self service coffee would have helped a bit) the toaster was a bit dangerous too.    Evening in the bar a great music duo but the same songs every night got a bit boring the male bar staff seemed to be very judgemental about providing drinks my wife and I were given mint-tea when we asked for our third glass of wine. Bar snacks were few and far between and kept well out of reach of most people.    We went all-inclusive personally I wouldn't recommend that option for others as we were sometimes made to feel second class because of this when eating or drinking.    In all I would go there again perhaps for a short break rather than a week.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewbI19LH
Kenzi Menara Palace,Dosser_Man wrote a review Nov 2015,50,A wonderful break in a wonderful hotel!,Arrival - we were asked to sit down in the spacious reception area & fill in some forms whilst being served mint tea. A small mix-up with our booking (nobody's fault - just a misunderstanding between us the hotel & the booking company) which was well handled by the hotel staff.  The suite - It was enormous! The suite's amenities were good (minibar safe TV etc). The bed was comfortable. The bathroom was large. The towelling robes were a nice touch but slippers to go with them would have been appreciated. A small grumble though - a TV in the lounge (rather than just in the bedroom) would have been nice.  Staff - We didn't meet one member of staff who didn't smile & greet us. All staff were great but special mentions for Fatima on the Front Desk for her non-stop smiling and Hassan in the Oriental Bar for his great service and attitude.  Pool - The large pool was bracing! (I think the time of year & size of the pool didn't help.) Still it did encourage me to exercise harder by swimming faster. The small pool was much nicer for swimming in.  Pool Bar - The staff were always smiling always willing to help and the food was nice. Not sure about others reporting that they were served cold food - ours was always freshly cooked warm and tasty. A nice touch would be if the staff occasionally walked round the pool area offering to refill drinks for the guests. Other hotels manage this which made this service even more noticeably absent here.  Pool/Towel Boys - Regardless of who was on duty at the time we were always intercepted on our way to the loungers by one of the towel boys with towels ready in his hand for us.  Food - We didn't go hungry! The waiting staff were polite & helpful (only once did I have to ask one of them for a refill of my coffee cup) and the food was always good. The chefs were always happy to explain what the different dishes were and we both ate well during our stay. The food in the Italian restaurant was fantastic but the one waiter on duty that night did seem to be struggling to cope on his own.  Overall view - This was a late choice as our holiday to Sharm el Sheikh was cancelled at short notice. We were not disappointed! The hotel gives the impression of being very much a 5* hotel. Sure like any place if you scratch hard enough at the surface you'll find little niggles but we didn't experience anything to make our stay any less enjoyable. If you like nightclubs/partying then this is not the hotel for you. If you like relaxing/unwinding then this definitely is the hotel for you (if relaxing by the pool doesn't help you unwind then the excellent on-site spa will!) I would have no hesitation in returning to this hotel and I'm seriously considering doing so next year.

The staff are not the friendliest or most helpful. The waiters during meals were the worst I've ever encountered. Sometimes waited over 20 minutes to be served drinks which is unacceptable. They would always serve people who came after me. I don't if it is because I look young or I am black. The staff are very rude and unpleasant. Service during breakfast lunch and dinner was slow. Bed sheets are not changed. There were stains on the towels everyday. I would have never expected this from a 5 star hotel. We paid a lot of money to be treated like dirt.

Was told to fill out forms and a little while given room card but we had to find our own way until we asked a member of staff for directions. The room was very clean and spacious and clean towels everyday but beware because sometimes the people knock the door and just enter so good advice put do not disturb on door . There was no face flannels and no slippers . We complained about the air conditioning not working and we left three people in room when we came back as been out all day the room was cooler but when we opened the curtains in the morning all they had done was open the patio doors WE WERE ON GROUND FLOOR!  The food menu was at the pool bar looked good but when arrived we either had cold chips or the burger was cold when we complained they told us a fresh one would come.....they reheated the burger roll on third attempt burger roll came back black and we were told it was a new burger and looked inside of roll and it was the first burger  They done snacks which were nice cakes etc. but get it when it comes out as they don't cover the food and birds sit on it.  Last night having a dodgy stomach for a view days I tried to have some vegetables and while I was eating I chewed onto metal I complained to the assistant manager and he apologised and said we could have a drink at the bar ....he just wasn't listening as I had dodgy stomach but he did put us to a different restaurant so I could only eat a little bit of rice and meat but it was nice. At breakfast the waiters were meant to give you tea or coffee but sometimes we didn't have it as they would see to other people instead and clear the tables  it was the same problem in evenings we got so fed up we ended helping ourselves to the coke.  Animation team....well they hand out towels which they run out by 12 and they tried to give me a dirty one oh and they do water aerobics  Please note as well if you don't book as a package holiday you will be billed at the end of you're stay for government tax.  It's a shame because it is such a beautiful building and the gardens are lovely and they also offer a transfer to the market which is free.  Don't change you're money at airport or hotel you can get a better rate in town but make sure you work it out as one bank tried to short change us.,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Luton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/66secret

Kenzi Menara Palace,981tullia wrote a review Nov 2015,50,Simply Stunning,The trip to this hotel was last minute for my birthday and first impressions were absolutely wow. The hotel is simply beautiful with the most exquisite gardens and fantastic swimming pools. Every bit of thought and detail has been put into designing the hotel and its rooms. The food was also absolutely fabulous with a vast range and choice to suit everyone.  The issues I had was the Italian restaurant firstly - We ate in there but the service was awful we were sat with our dirty plates for almost 45 minutes and we had to ask the waiter to bring more wine and one and a half hour later we gave up on asking for any dessert. The restaurant was beautifully designed well laid out but the lack of service really let it down. The chicken I had was overdone and not really edible so I couldnt recommend the restaurant for eating either.  The main dining area the first couple of days the service was excellent but after that it went downhill tables not fully laid it was a constant ask for more wine and more often than not we sat with dirty plates at the tables. I did wonder if it was because we did not tip the waiter every day we had bad service. The staff though were always immaculately dressed and were always really polite and pleasant when we spoke to them.  Our room was not completely made up one day we were missing towels and drinks from the mini bar and another day our room was not done at all. So I was really dissappointed with this for a 5* hotel.  As it was my birthday the hotel did make me a lovely cake and sang happy birthday to me which was so nice but the general service really let the hotel down.  The hotel is so close to the airportabout 10 min drive and the hotel does offer a free shuttle bus daily into the centre of Marrakech frequently throughout the day.  The little newspaper shop we bought some sunglasses from which werent cheap and the lens fell out of them the shop keeper whose attitude was dreadful refused to exchange them so I would not recommend buying anything which may be breakable.  I would also recommend not exchanging money at UK airports as the exchange rate is poor upon landing in Marrakech the exchange rate desks are open and you can easily change money there and the rate was pretty good. The hotel also does exchange money and their rate is also very good however on two ocasions we went the hotel had no currency and we were told we had to wait for quite some time so if needing money check in advance they will have some.  Although there were downfalls with this hotel and I was dissapppointed with some aspects all in all its a beautiful hotel and one I would go to again.  The outside pool bar is beautiful with an extensive menu we had luch their one day and it was really nice. The staff are really friendly their to but will finish their private conversations before attending to you. But generally much better service than inside the hotel restaurants.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,warwickshire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/981tullia
Kenzi Menara Palace,Jenny H wrote a review Nov 2015,40,Lovely quiet location away from the hustle and bustle but still close enough!,Having had our flight to Sharm El Sheik cancelled at the last minute - we opted for Marrakech where we have been before but we stayed in the Medina. This hotel is located at the end of the main Mohammed V1 road and the location is therefore quieter than some of the others. A short taxi ride will take you into the Medina. This hotel is large and appeals to golfers and groups. If you are staying here opt for all inclusive. Most people are and the hotel is geared up for this with a large buffet at breakfast and dinner. One-off meals are expensive for what is on offer I think. The breakfasts are excellent with a great choice and lovely fresh eggs and omelettes cooked to order.  There are two pools; the larger one was not heated but the small one was. There is a very nice poolside bar and restaurant but the food is just so-so and we found it a bit hit and miss (cold burger sent back twice and very un appealing club sandwich). There seem to be plenty of sunbeds to cater for the amount of people and some lovely cabana's too.  The hotel is very clean and well maintained and generally everyone is very helpful. WiFi is free and keeps you logged in after first entering the password and works all over the hotel and around the pool which is a huge plus!  We would definitely come back to this hotel and come fully inclusive as this is by far the best value - even if you opt to eat outside the hotel a couple of nights.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Reading, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JennyH366

Pool was stunning and other entertainment alternatives such as the gym and spa were also held to a very high standard.    Breakfast each morning was fantastic and although we only ate dinner there twice I was impressed overall.    By far the best thing about this hotel however was the friendly and exceptionally helpful manner of the staff; most notably the concierge Cherif. Most staff spoke perfect English and those who didn't still spoke more than proficiently. Assistance was readily and enthusiastically supplied when needed and then some.    Marrakech can be a daunting place for strangers; it certainly was for us! It was such a great experience to have all of our trips and day plans (including travel) booked through Cherif the concierge and to have them turn out as exciting and fun as they did.    I have already recommended this hotel to friends and will be certain to come again if I ever find myself began in Marrakech.,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Reading, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoeReardonMorgan
Kenzi Menara Palace,lauzzop wrote a review Nov 2015,30,Birthday holiday.,The hotel and grounds are lovely very clean and well looked after. Staff mainly friendly and hard working. The bar staff were always there with a smile and some delicious nibbled in the evening!(still dreaming of the Fekka's!)  The shuttle bus is a nice addition. Great location.  Pool attendants really attentive and mainly noticing new arrivals and bringing over towels and beds. The pool itself was a little cold but very large!  We had an excellent massage at the spa which was lovely.  The pastry chef(s) are very talented! We usually indulged with every meal as they were all so delicious.  Both lunchtime and evening waiters were great very friendly and professional service despite the food being buffet.    1 star knocked off as we were sent to stay in a sister hotel for 2 of our 7 nights on arrival. The reason for this kept changing but at the end it turned out that the hotel had taken a conference booking(after we had booked!) and prioritises these guests.  The sister hotel was horrendous despite promises that it was the same quality as Kenzi Menara. Filthy broken amenities damp on rooms. (5 room changes between 2 couple and we still ended up with one ground floor door unlockable and one safe not working!) literally spent the whole of the first day moving our cases around and complaining.  Unfortunately one of the nights we were stuck here was my birthday so this was a shame. They promised us free transport to Kenzi Menara to eat meals here as the food was terrible at the place we were sent but this took 90 minutes of waiting outside the front of the hotel!  They tried to make up for all of this with a room upgrade discounted trip and a free meal in the Moroccan restaurant which usually incurs an extra charge but sadly the damage had already been done and we will not be returning to the hotel for a second stay.    The second star we have held back is due to the poor quality of drinks which were served(extra charges for branded drinks very limited pre-mixed cocktails sometimes ran out of beer etc!) whilst the food was lovely some variety would have been nice - perhaps more theme nights.  Entertainment was very poor.  Just a few areas of improvement would truly bring this up to the luxury of a 4/5 star resort.    Overall we would not return ourselves if you did book and not encounter the same issues as we did then we are sure you would have an enjoyable time.,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauzzop
Kenzi Menara Palace,Cheryl H wrote a review Nov 2015,50,fantastic hotel in great location with good service and lovley food,Arrived at hotel and was greeted buy the bell boy who took our cases and then sat us down in this fantastic hotel lounge and made us a lovely mint tea. Service was quick  attentive and professional. We where shown to our rooms which where more like suites they where soooo big. My husband and I could not even meet in the middle our bed was so big. The room also had a sofa and chair and desk in. Safe fridge and a bath room with his and her sinks with separate loo with bidet. The bath room was big enough to do cart wheels in! Then there was a knock on the door and a lady brought us welcome cakes and water. Sooo nice. Welcome on the T.V in the room as well.  Food was excellent every day with a BBQ one night and the choice of two other restaurants a Moroccan and a Italian. Pool was the biggest we have ever had at a hotel but one negative it was very cold. only other negative was the bed was to hard for me but my husband found it fine. Personal choice I guess. The shuttle bus was available every couple of hours and if full the hotel concierge would even take you to town in his own car!  He would also arrange trips for you. We asked for a camel trip with diner in a Bedouin tent. We had a brilliant time both on the camels dinner belly dancing and henna tattoo. He also arranged for us to go to the atlas mountains and have tea in a barber house then on to a botanic gardens then on to a waterfall up the mountains.  in short a great hotel with great staff and perfect location.  recommended ++++++++,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,london,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mumsey
Kenzi Menara Palace,Monika M wrote a review Nov 2015,40,Luxury hotel,Visited the hotel in the end of October and been really surprised by the decor of the hotel. You get the wow factor when you come inside. Paintings throughout the hotel looks great and they are massive. Always took my eyes away!    We been offered a cup of tea on the arrival while filling the papers. Very nice touch which leaves feeling you welcome at the beginning.    Size of the rooms are impressive! Massive ! And they all have balconies which is fantastic. Unfortunately our room balcony was facing traffic and noises woke us up in the morning. We asked to move the room as this has just spoiled all the happiness about the hotel. The girl in the reception moved as away next to the kitchen. It was no noise but as we requested luxury room on booking I was not too impressed. When you book the hotel make sure you ask for the pool view!!!    Pool was amazing size of it impressive!!! There was always space where to lie down. And I loved that the pool was supplying fresh towels every morning!    Wifi was free of charge as well. Which was very nice. It didn't work that well at the pool but general connection in the hotel was good.    Free shuttle to town really nice gesture.  The location hotel and decor is really nice as well super clean.    The only thing is food. As a regular traveller I was quite disappointed. Buffet choice was ok but food quality not that much. Especially the salads it looked like the hotel concentrated on the quantity but not the quality! Breakfast selection was quite nice. But dinner would need to be improved massively!  Moroccan restaurant. Been really disappointed. The man working up there was totally lost that day I hope it is not everyday like that there. We waited 45 minutes to receive the menus. And 15 hours to receive the starters. The quality of the food is not too impressive as well.    Further service. To get a cup of coffee in the morning -challenge. There was always people working but this eye to detail was always missed. I would expect that to be normal in 5 star hotels. Service could definitely be improved.    Another point to mention. Lady singing in the evenings. Or should I say drinking in the evenings. We would come to listen to some music to the lobby she would sing one song and then just would chat and drink for ages. We felt left to go back to the room.    Overall the hotel is in a quiet location outside of the busy city centre. Nice decor and very clean. Would recommend this hotel to stay in Marrakesh  the only thing would consider taking all inclusive for the food. It might be better travelling to town for the dinner time. As well its good to explore local culture!,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Monika900811

Kenzi Menara Palace,Melzago wrote a review Oct 2015,40,Very good hotel but bad food quality,I enjoyed everything at the hotel but the food. First of all the check in was nice: they offered me a tea and took the time to explain me what the hotel had to offer and someone kindly took me to my room as it can be far away.The room was very big with a nice view over the swimmingpool the bed was very bid and everything was decently cleaned. Staff was very helpful at any request but sometimes rude on the phone. I didn't like at all the man at the concierge: he was rude and didn't care much about what i was asking he kept interrupting me to talk on the phone or to other people and also adviced me the wrong thing about a supratours bus to Essaouira. What i didn't like at all it was the food in general: Buffet is very expensive and not good even the Moroccan restaurant has got low food quality without talking about the italian one where i ate a risotto that felt like eating a chewingum (probably heated into a microwave oven). There is free WIFI but it works in a very bad way: actually most of the time it was not working at all. The hotel is located in a very quiet area and i enjoyed the free shuttle to the medina although the last shuttle back is at 19h15 only it would be nice to have a later one. It's a very good hotel after all but they really need to improve the quality of their food or people will feel obliged to go to eat outside.,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Lumezzane, Italy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Melzago
Kenzi Menara Palace,Tony K wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Winter break,The hotel is set within a 10 acre land just 10 minutes away from Marrakech central area.  Swooping driveway leading to the main entrance makes it so much more appealing and gives you that VIP status. Very helpful friendly and efficient staff. The room was huge and provided separate area for storing your clothes big bathrooms with deep bath and separate shower. In our room we had a large terrace that lead on to grass lawn and olive trees.. Perfect!!!  There is an outdoor pool which is I think an Olympic size with plenty of loungers and an outdoor bar and snack place. There is 3 main restaurants and all with excellent food!  There is a 24 hour concierge but during the day a very friendly welcoming concierge gentleman called Cherif.. Now he's the guy to speak to if you want any help or recommendations of places to visit or eat or anything really! He knows it all!!!  I highly recommend you first time visitors to go see him.  This holiday has been fantastic and wrapped up well before winter in UK sets in.  So I therefore recommend this hotel for any one visiting.,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kwant
Kenzi Menara Palace,Lia S wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Went out of their way to make our stay fantastic!,Stayed at this hotel with three friends. We were only there for one night to enable us to go to a particular restaurant and to take a trip to the atlas mountains the next day.  The receptionist saw from our passports that it was my friend's birthday so asked as if we'd like to celebrate it there before our restaurant reservation. She advised that they could make a cake for the birthday girl for no charge. We agreed thinking it was lovely of them. Later they presented us with a lovely chocolate mousse cake which was decorated exquisitely with macaroons and chocolate work. Also the band for their Moroccan night sang happy birthday along with the hotel staff and other guests. My friend was very surprised!  As for the accommodation the room was spacious and the beds very comfortable.  The hotel has a lovely lobby area and the staff were very accommodating - they went that extra mile.  The outside pools were clean the gardens were pretty and the private cabanas were a great touch.  I wish we could have stayed longer - maybe another time soon.,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Ipswich, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/781lias

Kenzi Menara Palace,Richard D wrote a review Oct 2015,40,Great hotel,Very nice hotel. Stayed in October for 3 nights all inclusive. Staff were great very helpful. Would certainly stay there again.  Service levels in the restaurant could be a little better for a 5-star but still very good. Food was varied and plentiful for all meals and standard was very high although there were no snacks available between the long meal times. Probably not a bad thing for the waistline. Pastries fruit cereals cooked continental breakfasts lunch and dinner had a choice of at least 4 hot dishes various salads and breads and desserts. Drinks from the bars were all good with bottles of water available.  Room was huge as was the bed and had a great bathroom. Cleaned daily but the air con seemed a bit weak although adequate. Great minibar on AI restocked daily. Nice big flat screen TV even if the choice of English channels is standard north Africa – French German and Arabic mostly.  Pool was huge and about 5 feet in its deepest part with a separate shallow kid’s part. Sunbeds were all occupied so high season may be problematic unless they had some out of sight in storage.  The hotel courtesy bus into town 5 times a day was brilliant although you could always get a taxi from the front of the hotel at any time. Try to get lower value notes and some coins as quickly as you can as you will need these for tips (about 14 dirham to £1 when we went).  A bit of French will go a long way especially in town and haggling. Town market traders are much less aggressive than I have seen in Turkey and Tunisia so don’t believe any horror stories.

Poolbar food was also delicious and the barstaff always smiling.

Kenzi Menara Palace,NatashaLouise2015 wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Fabulous Stay in Marrakech,At first sight this hotel has the WOW factor .. very beautiful hotel with a huge swimming pool and amazing interior design. The staff were very attentive. Every member of staff from cleaners to managers had smiles on their faces greeting us as we walked passed asking if we was ok and if there was anything they could do for us. They simply could not do enough for us. Once they were aware it was my birthday a member of staff arranged for flowers to be delivered to our room. We stayed in a double deluxe pool view room and it was huge so much room. The bathroom was amazing with a bath that could easily for three people (if you so wish) and a separate walk in shower cubicle. The food at the hotel was amazing .. i particularly enjoyed the Moroccan a la carte restaurant with the fantastic singing chef - he popped out the kitchen from time to time and sang with the Moroccan musicians. The pool has amazing views of the atlas mountains such a beautiful back drop to a beautiful place. The staff around the pool were very friendly. There was one gentleman (I didn't catch his name) who walked around the pool every day asking every guest how they were how their day had been and made us aware of the entertainment that was happening in the pool area during the day. My favourite was the aqua aerobics i haven't laughed so much in a long time. Towels were supplied free of charge. I very much enjoyed our time at the Kenzi Menara and I am very much looking forward to returning next year.

The rooms were pretty good and spacious with a mini bar big bathroom and loads of wardrobe space and a safe. The two bars were well stocked although a lot of the drinks you would have expected to have been included were extra ( about 6 quid for a Bacardi and Coke ). They did lay on a bit of entertainment round the pool while cooking a barbecue which was very good and the staff were very friendly and attentive. The evening singer was not bad but was on most nights and got a bit samey as the days went on but it was out of season. The golf courses are very good and the Assoufid on our last day was voted the best course in Africa in 2014 which most in our group would agree with although we haven't played all the others. All in all a great week away in a really good hotel which I would have no hesitation in recommending.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Lainee18 wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Memorable Stay in Marrakech,Just returned from our stay at the Kenzi Menara (we were  on an all-inclusive basis) the weather was very pleasant although we did have a few cloudy days but expected in October.    Most of their staff were extremely helpful and courteous particularly the reception ladies Nassira and Fatima. Mr Cherif on the other hand in my experience was not. I did however note him on a number of occasions very helpful and friendly towards other guests but each time I approached him he very rarely gave my husband and I his full attention and was continually distracted by other guests walking past him when you were in conversation with him very annoying! He hailed us a taxi to take us to the new shopping area (not the Medina) and told us it would be 80Dhms. The taxi driver dropped us in the middle of nowhere saying we just had to walk down the street and then charged us 100Dhms when we got our own taxi back it was 3Dhms (I actually gave him 50 but you get my drift).    The people in Marrakech generally are warm and friendly and the Medina is amazing as to is the market square yes you will get lost but go it alone the guides usually take you to specific shops and a number of hotel guests we spoke to said they were very frustrated by this and wished they had gone it alone. Getting lost is part of the Marrakech experience too loved it.    The food was excellent and the majority of the restaurant staff were exceptional in particular Mohammed and Anas served us very well. Yes there were sometimes delays in the drinks coming but you are on holiday so take a chill pill. We enjoyed the Italian but not so much the Morrocon.    The pool area is kept exceptionally clean and tidy and there are numerous sun beds and brollies to be had although it was October so not sure how it would be in the summer season.    The gym is adequate but you had to pay extra to use the indoor swimming pool even though we were allegedly on the Premium All Inclusive when I challenged them about this they said we had not booked direct with the hotel (we booked through Expedia so may be something to bear in mind in future).    Overall we had an amazing stay and would recommend this hotel and will certainly look to stay there in the future.,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Aldershot, Hants",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lainee18

Particularly those at reception: Nassira Fatima (x2) Doha and of course Mr Cherif ( and his team) who is an excellent Concierge and who amongst other things can arrange very good and reasonably priced trips to for example the Atlas Mountains for the day and Essaouira for the day.

We were greeted with pleasant staff fresh mint tea and a request to have some breakfast with the legendary Cheriffe. If goes with out saying to mention Cheriffe and the outstanding concierge team who provided us with some brilliant excursions at very reasonable prices throughout the week! The theme was continued with the staff throughout the rest of the week attentive helpful and nothing too much trouble.    We were given an immediate upgrade to an impeccable suite with pool view the size of the room offering is second to none for a central Marrakech hotel.    The food is worth mentioning as it seems to be commented upon negatively by numerous reviewers. It is worth highlighting that if you want to eat burger pizza and chips every meal perhaps this hotel is not for you (however this is on offer at the lovely pool bar in the late afternoon). The hotel dishes out amazing meals at every point of the day fresh and an amazing array of vegetables and salads lots of meat and fish options and some beautifully presented cuisine throughout the restaurants    Short but sweet and highly recommended!!

Unfortunately the same can't be said about the receptionists or the administrator's.    The concierge Cherif is there to help you organise your days out but do be carefull as he charges you random amounts as he does not make it clear that there are other fees to be paid separately. Also it's quite strange when we asked for a receipt he's response was 'he is the receipt'.    We tried the restaurant on the first night the food was terrible. However the breakfast was good as one would expect.    As we travel frequently the service is definately not a 5 star as they claim.

My girlfriend and I had a minor issue with dinner and Mnsr Mosid was very concerned with our experience and with correcting this. It would have been easier for him to just remove the item from our bill but he invited us back to understand the issue (a sauce wasn't served with a cous cous dish which should have been) so he could correct. I was very impressed with the way he handled the situation. I should say we didn't really complain just mentioned to reception (the next day) that the dish was flat compared to the other food - it may have been corrected on the night had we said but we werent to know a sauce was missing. The food was fantastic when we revisited thank you Mnsr Mosaid.,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,The Netherlands,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/null
Kenzi Menara Palace,peachesKent wrote a review Oct 2015,30,Nice hotel with some glitches,The hotel is quite sumptuous with lovely big rooms nice outdoor seated areas fabulous pool area.  The food in the buffet isn't great but the Pool Bar food is nice. The service is a bit hit & miss with women/English mainly being ignored until assertiveness kicks in! Some staff were friendly but mainly stand offish!  Cherif the Concierge is a real asset. Be aware that most drivers & locals have an agenda/scam for tourists so always fix prices first & don't let drivers take you where they want to take you. Don't get conned as is the norm unfortunately!  Our balcony door did not lock reported first day but was never fixed. Room cleaning was good & rooms were comfy had everything we needed.  I did enjoy my stay however there is disparity in service & standard of food. All inclusive is treated differently differing menus for cocktails & food. On requesting a cocktail was told I had to pay extra yet another tourist received free of charge.  In my opinion everyone should be treated the same with same standards of service. Was interesting to see how the hotel staff upped their game when a medical conference started. Suddenly the hotel came to life with trying to impress the conference guests!,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"West Wickham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peachesKent

Kenzi Menara Palace,Prince1968 wrote a review Sep 2015,20,Golfing trip,1st trip to Morocco on our usual golfing trip for 12 we go to Spain or Portugal but thought an all inclusive would be a better option  and given the weather Morocco seemed a great option .  It has to be said that golf in Morocco is very good  but the Kenzi Menara is much less than good .  The hotel is well laid out he pool and the rooms are comfortable and clean ish .  Our check in was shambolic although after an argument and one night in the wrong rooms we were put in the correct rooms  obviously a bit of hassle .  The food at the Kenzi is generally disgusting  they serve the same muck day in day out  the Moroccan restaurant is worse than the very poor Italian  the drinks aren't genuine brands and are horrible  the beer is dreadful and served warm the wine is undrinkable and the service of the waiting staff  with a few exceptions is dreadful .  The real shame about this hotel is that without spending very much money they could make it so much better  cold drinks are not difficult to achieve  the trouble is that they are trying to make money at every turn  if you order a Casablanca beer at the bar which is nice local beer it is served cold with a smile  but only because you have to pay for it .  Needless to say I will not be returning ever  and on the back of this will probably give Morocco a miss.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Morsal A wrote a review Sep 2015,30,Good but could be much better,"First the good: beautiful and spacious rooms. Maybe not 5 star worthy when comparing to North America but close. Nicest amenity at the resort is the pool large with plenty of chairs and beds. Towel service is also provided. The pools do not have a deep end (1.5 m is the deepest it goes).    Bad: poor food quality and service. we opted for the breakfast only package because we intended to be out and about most of our stay in medina and around marrakech. However we stayed during eid where almost all businesses were closed so during that day we ended up staying for lunch and dinner. Note that the price adder to go all inclusive is about $55 per person and without lounging around all day and sipping on drinks you would be better off paying for the meals as the restaurants are fairly priced. Note most of the guests opt for the all inclusive package and some of the hotel staff need to be educated so that they can acknowledge the difference. For example we had dinner at the Italian restaurant we were served uncooked rice in our risotto and a frozen tiramisu. We told our waiter numerous instances there was something wrong and she just replied ""sorry"". Yes if we were in the all inclusive package we would have ordered 5 desserts and would not care if one of them came out frozen. Come our bill we were charged full price for all dishes.  The hotel seems to have a lot of staff and most of them are polite courteous. Some seems to just lounge around all day and chit chat and get annoyed when you ask for something.",Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/morsala2015

The room was suposed to be with two beds instead they gave us a huge bed and said they would split the big bed (which they did not and I had to sleep in the huge bed with my mom).

The concierge gave us good tips and managed good drivers for us but in general in Marroco I feel like they always have something in the deals....  The food is just something else so so so good!!!!

We did a tour of Morocco and visited Casablanca Tangier Marrakech and Agadir.    I would like to say that if you are looking for a luxury hotel this is the place to go. I think this was actually the nicest hotel I've ever been to... ever. The place is so so clean the decorations are beautiful the rooms are spacious and very luxurious. The beds were super comfortable the breakfast had good quality food with a grand selection so everybody could find something that they like.    The pool was so nice and there is a bar/resto that serves great drinks and food. The prices for the food were pretty reasonable... not too high considering it's at the hotel right by the pool.    The hotel is also in a good location (near shops cafes restaurants museums etc)....

Kenzi Menara Palace,FindingNemo76 wrote a review Sep 2015,40,Relaxing time but a few minor niggles,Just come back from a relaxing week at the Menara Palace. The hotel is a 10 minute transfer from the airport - this was much appreciated after the drawn out process that is passport control in Marrakech airport - patience definitely needed :-)    The check in process at the hotel was very quick and accompanied by a refreshing glass of mint tea. Our room was spacious - we had a separate living room with tv and sofa area. The bedroom was separate with a huge bed traditionally decorated (room not bed!) with ANOTHER tv! Bathroom was huge with his and hers sinks! Bath tub and separate shower and toilet. The only disappointment with the room was that it was supposed to be a garden view but stead our balcony overlooked what appeared to be a staff carpark. In fact one day I saw a member of staff cleaning out some pots. Not what you would expect but we didn't complain as we really only spent time in the room to sleep.    The hotel has a couple of bar areas one with a tv that showed international football such as premiere and champions league - very handy if you or the people you are traveling with enjoy their football.    There is one man restaurant which serves food buffet style and two a la carte - Morrocan and Italian. We only tried the Italian and the food was FANTASTIC! I recommend the tiramisu - it was to die for! The buffet food was varied and I always found something to eat which was enjoyable. I think vegetarians would struggle to find a man meal they could eat as the dishes were all meat or fish based although there were vegetarian sides like vegetables mashed potatoes etc. I was disappointed not to find flat bread being the staple bread item since we were in Morocco - I found the bread rolls too crusty (or they could hav gone hard after beng exposed to the open air). There were salads available every day as well as cold buffet items. The cold buffet items were not labelled like the main dishes were so it was a bit hit or miss whether the items chosen were tasty or not! Also in the buffet restaurant the only alcohol served is beer and wine. If you ant spirits you have to go to the bar. I think they should widen the drinks menu and offer other types of alcohol with your dinner.    The pool is MASSIVE and very clean. There were loads of sun beds available and also had great positions in the sun. Parasols are also available if the heat gets too much for you. The main pool is split into two sections - the deeper is 1.5 ft and the shallow end is ankle depth. There is a separate kids pool to the right of the bar area. The bar Serbs drinks from th morning and there is a food menu which is a available after 3 pm if you are staying on an all inclusive basis. You can order burgers salads sandwiches pasta marinated chicken meat and fish skewers. The food is lovely and you are served very quickly.    All in all the week was enjoyable - just a couple of minor points which if improved would have made me give it a five star instead of 4:    1) better balcony view  2) iron in the room - I had to take my clothes down to reception collect a key and be escorted to the ironing room. A five star hotel should b able to at least bring an iron to your room if they can't provide one in each room. I wouldn't expect clientele to hav to have to ring their clothes to a separate room.  3) the service at breakfast was sometimes very slow especially if you go down to breakfast early. My husband end up mak g his own coffee as there was no-one to be seen for ages  4) more traditional Morrocan breads please!!!  5) our room was not cleaned for two days as as the shower leaked the towels we send to mop the water were completely sodden. On complaining to reception no apology was made which I would have expected.    To balance the above points these are the reason for booking the hotel:    1) lovely spacious rooms  2) beautiful grounds and pool  3) polite staff  4) good food  5) free wifi (sometimes patchy but more often uninterrupted)    If you have any questions please get in touch!!!,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FindingNemo76

Kenzi Menara Palace,00JpM wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Excellent hotel very relaxing,We had such a lovely time staying at this hotel. We were a little apprehensive about this hotel as saw a few mixed reviews and that bad ones often stick in your mind more so than the good. I couldnt fault this hotel at all. We found the staff very friendly especially front of house. All the cleaners waiters etc always greeted us.    The hotel was very clean and the decour inside is wonderful with very Moroccan features and fresh flowers. our room was huge facing the gardens and had all we needed including a restocked mini bar each day daily service of the room and a lovely balcony. It was very quiet too. there was no iron though which can often be useful but we had a travel iron.    the pool is huge and fresh so obviously well looked after including the grounds around it. pool bar was great the drinks were really good and food nice from the a la carte menu. always plenty of sunbeds and also bed which were lovely to lay on all day. there are fresh towels as well which means if you are pushed for room in your case there's no need to take a beach towel. the staff around the pool were good fun always trying to get the guests involved in small activities but theses didnt affect the peacefulness of the area.    i used the gym which was full of really good equipment not huge but had all I needed.    of the three restaurants we only used the buffet one but found the food good varied and different each day. breakfast was great we didnt eat lunch that much as tended to have a late lunch at the pool bar but the dinner was nice.    I was unwell one day and struggled to leave the room the staff were very helpful checking if I needed the doctor and making sure I was ok they also ensured we got room service so we ate (or at least my partner did) which was foc and very generous.    in general this hotel is a great place to stay. we try not to go back to the same place twice but would stay here again if wanted the same holiday.,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/00JpM

Kenzi Menara Palace,Poppy1111111 wrote a review Sep 2015,10,The most awful 5* hotel EVER.,"We are two couples from London aged 19-22.  Save your money and go elsewhere; here is why:    Rude staff alongside awful food accompanied by LONG WAITS for tedious tasks which should have been done.    As the remainder of reviews paint the food is honesty terrible. It tastes cheap rarely warm and very watery! It is pretty much the same at lunch/dinner with minimal variation.  The staff take far too long to come to the table to attend to you for drinks (sometimes going the whole meal without a drink) and when you ask responses included ""WAIT!"" (Very rudely)    The piano bar staff (words cannot describe the poor service and training). *sigh*  We requested to do shisha (an extra charge of 150RAK - any point doing all inclusive?!) the female bar woman asked the male barman (skinny young) who said its ""done for the day"" - it was 21:45. She showed us on her phone which she took out to show us the time. The females name is Adouna.    We then said ""why didn't anybody mention the time limit?"" To which the woman spoke in Arabic again the man and then he said ""okay."" - LAZINESS! Disgusting behaviour.  To top it off... The next day we saw MULTIPLE couples/groups with shisha WELL AFTER this so called ""time limit"".    A 5* HOTEL WITH NO IRON?! How is this possible.. Clothes get creased in suitcases and one would like the comfort to iron in their own room (after all you have paid good money to stay) but no... You have to take your clothes all the way to the lobby get escorted to ONE room with ONE iron and then come all the way up. Inefficient and time consuming utterly ridiculous.    This hotel even goes as far as being SEXIST and not dealing with female needs. I asked where to get hygienic female products to be escorted to their ""shop"" where ONE pack was 95RAK equating to £7 for a small pack of cheap tampons. Other 5* hotels have provided one sanitary towel with other room products. THIS DOES NOT COMPARE.    I made a complaint to the bar staff about a different menu that wasn't included in the ""all inclusive"" and asked why.  They said the alcohol included in these cocktails are more expensive.  Fair enough so I asked to have the all inclusive alcohol (cheaper) with the other ingredients (mint for mojito etc) which they couldn't do?  The guest relation manager then understood this and went to speak to the other manager who after two hours of waiting didn't turn up. (Typical?!)    The barman at this bar also took a wasp out of a drink that someone had ordered and then casually gave it to him? These are not hygienic standards... I wouldn't even expect this from a 3* hotel. His name was Anas.    We also booked to eat in the Italian restaurant through reception and went down for dinner bang on time for them not to receive our reservation. This was a delight for the one night we did eat in the Italian restaurant. We then HAD TO ASK for the menus.... And 30 minutes after being seated we had not been given a bottle of water that we had ordered.    The wifi is poor - very slow even though it shows full strength in the signal. The business centre room has a slow computer and a printer that doesn't work.    However there are also commendable staff. Moaad was the only pool staff who was EXCEPTIONAL in his service and was up to the 5* standard. Jamal the restaurant manager was amazing and met every demand when waiters said I was not allowed grated cheese he brought over a small bowl full of it.  Cherif did a good job of the day trip to the mountains. We couldn't understand why he was being named so much in the reviews but then realised in comparison to the rest of the hotel staff he is very good at his job and is 5* quality.  The grounds of this hotel are lovely and the room was a nice size. (The air con doesn't come onto the bed though and there are no movies as advertised.)    This hotel is utterly ridiculous and is definitely NOT ON PAR with other 5* hotels in the world and I cannot express the disappointment I have felt being here and experiencing Marrakech with awful service and a surprisingly BAD hotel. Because of this I will now not visit other Sentido resorts and I suggest you don't waste your time money or effort otherwise you WILL be disappointed.",Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PoppyJox

Kenzi Menara Palace,Hannah W wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Paradise! Pictures do not do this place justice.,We stayed at the Kenzi Menara Palace for 2 weeks from 21st August - 4th September.    Upon arrival we were completely in awe. The hotel itself is beautiful and so clean. Pictures of this hotel do not do it justice. Reception staff were very accommodating and check in was quick and easy.    Rooms are lovely and spacious with a safe and plenty of closet space. Double beds are absolutely huge- only complaint is that the pillows are quite uncomfortable.    We initially got put in a room facing the road which we weren't too happy about given that it was quite noisy. However a quick polite word with reception and we were moved to a lovely room facing the pool the next day. The staff cannot do enough for you and made us feel very welcome.    The staff throughout the hotel are very friendly even the maintenance and housekeeping staff always have a smile and a hello for you.    The food at the hotel is ok. Breakfast is good - variety of fruit freshly made omelettes pastries yogurts cooked breakfast and so on. Something for everyone. Lunch is also good best if you get there between 12.30 - 1pm when everything is freshly prepared. Again something for everyone.    Dinner however is very average and you do tire very easily of the same every evening. Usually consists of the same salads as the lunch buffet with a couple of meat/fish/pasta dishes.    There are two alternative restaurants in the hotel. A Morrocan restaurant (which is 100dm additional per person if you are all inclusive) and Italian (which is of no extra cost). Italian restaurant is great however avoid the Moroccan - we went here on our first evening and managed a mouthful of food each. Safe to say we never returned! Only positive was the waiter Ali so friendly and chatty and made sure we had everything we needed. An absolute star and really is a credit to the hotel.    Mini bar in the rooms are also included in your all inclusive package as is room service between 12am - 6am.    Would highly recommend heading into the new town or Place Jemaa El-fna of an evening (near the souks). The square has around a hundred or so food stalls all selling freshly prepared food - choice is endless (kebabs curries tagines) and is worth a visit. However be sure to ask the price of your meal before you start eating. Average price is around 100-120dirhams for 2 people. On our first visit we made the mistake of not asking and were charged 710 dirhams (which we managed to get down to 500 but still extortionate).    New town is also good highly recommend Italian restaurant Catanzaro. Good that rivals Italy but at a fraction of the price - we wished we had discovered it sooner!    The main attraction at the Kenzi Menara is definitely the big pool. There are two pools at the hotel the main pool area and a smaller pool just off it. Very clean and never any problem getting a sun lounger or a big four poster sunbed. Clean towels are provided everyday for you. The pool bar is ideal a Iarge selection of soft drinks beers and cocktails. Must warn you that the cocktails can be quite strong!!!    The food if you are all inclusive is available from 3-5 in the pool bar and is very good (the cheeseburgers are amazing!) and they even provide cakes and freshly made churros/donuts at around 4.45 - 5pm for everyone! Only niggle is some of the pool bar staff. The majority very friendly however a few very unfriendly and unhelpful.    During your first few days at the hotel I would recommend having a conversation with the concierge Charif. He can arrange day trips for you and can recommend a handful of restaurants if you do fancy venturing out. A great guy very friendly and always happy to help!    The hotel has also has a great little shop which is cheap and filled with all the little things you may have forgotten at home (sun creams toothpaste soaps etc).    Finally. The hotel has a brilliant spa which isn't included in the all inclusive package but very reasonably priced. I had a facial and my partner a back massage. Very clean very relaxing and would recommend a visit.    On the whole we could not fault our visit to the Kenzi Menara Palace and would definitely recommend to anyone looking to visit Morocco.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Puddy2409 wrote a review Sep 2015,40,Great Time in Marrakesh,We spent a week in August and had an overwhelmingly positive experience at the Kenzi Menara.    Despite what people say about the merits of pool view rooms our ground floor garden view room was ideally located facing away from the ever busy pool and instead overlooked the beautiful gardens. Being ground floor we didn't see the road but had uninterrupted views of greenery. We liked the fact you could just step out from the large terrace onto the grass.    The room itself was very big and had a sort of separate dressing area bathroom with bath and shower and a separate toilet (off the bathroom).  Yes the furniture is not brand new and a little scuffed but so what. The room incl beds was comfy also provideded two arm chairs. Free Wifi was available and really quite fast.    Breakfast offers a large buffet but as others have pointed out perhaps many dishes are more appropriate for lunch or even dinner. Nevertheless it offered everything we required and more and we found the waiters very attentive. Ali in particular was a delight being polite and attentive and taking an interest in his customers. We also enjoyed the sparrows flying in and looking for crumbs to steal.    We only had dinner in the hotel once in the so called Italian restaurant and found the room lacked a bit of character and the menu was not very exciting.  If you don't want to go back into Marrakesh in the evening but don't fancy hotel food either there is a small restaurant (actually mainly an ice cream parlour) diagonally opposite the hotel a 5 minute walk away which serves some small dishes and has a pleasant terrace to sit out on.  Or for families who want to picnic on their balconies or terraces at lunch or dinner time there is a supermarket in the shopping centre nearby. Leave the hotel through the main gates turn right along the main road and turn right again at your first opportunity. 10 minute walk but worth it for some groceries and also some fashion and gift shops.    The shuttle bus service several times a day to the main square is brilliant and saves you a bit of money and a lot of hassle negotiating with the local taxi drivers.    The large pool is undoubtedly one of the hotel's big assets. There are many sun loungers which staff move around quite willingly but despite their own policy and signs not to reserve the loungers this doesn't get enforced and we found all sun loungers 'taken' with towels at times with not many people in the pool. Staff unfortunately turn a blind eye to that.    Don't miss a day out in the Atlas Mountains. Sherif is going to organise it for you and it's absolutely worth it. We went on a group tour which was great but you weren't given any time on your own or a choice of restaurant for example. If we were to do it another time we would rent a car ourselves and explore.    So altogether a very enjoyable stay. Not 5* by western standards but very very pleasant.,Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Puddy2409
Kenzi Menara Palace,Travelling717 wrote a review Aug 2015,50,Perfect family holiday,I stayed at Kenzi Menara Palace with my family. We were nervous travelling without my dad and because of the stories we heard but due to the tight security we felt very safe and therefore enjoyed our stay here. Upon arrival we requested connecting rooms and that was arranged within minutes.  The hotel was clean spacious and beautiful. It definitely lived up to its name as we felt like princesses.  Abdulrahem (head of catering) was very efficient helpful and catered for our personal dietary requirements. All the staff were very professional and efficient.  We did our research and knew exactly where we wanted to go and Cherif organised it for us with our own private driver. We were promised an English speaking driver but unfortunately our driver didn't speak much English however he tried very hard and was a good safe driver who was always waiting for us outside the attractions.  The hotel spa was a great treat a little more expensive then having it outside but worth the luxury. The women in the spa made us feel very comfortable and relaxed it was very clean and a lovely environment.,Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelling717

Kenzi Menara Palace,Deee1 wrote a review Aug 2015,20,Sharif the concierge is the only reason to visit this hotel.,We have just come back from being guests at this beautiful lookin hotel. We were a party of 3 put the room only occupy 2 so the third person although paying the full price has to sleeps on a fold up bed covered in an old brown blanket. On arrival on finding only 2 beds we queried this at reception and they said all the rooms except suits are the same and they would bring the third bed up in 15 mins however it took about 4 hours -not a good start! Also I can see why some guest would say the that the food at this hotel is nice and there is plenty of choice but if you are well traveled use to proper 5* hotels and have a basic knowledge of the taste of different foods from around the world you would know after the second day that's not the case. The food is always cold very bland and the rice and potatoes always hard. Also one day they served sausages for breakfast and at lunchtime served the same left over sausages in a tagine and called it sausage tagine! One of our drivers on a trip was shocked that we chose all inclusive at this hotel and when we told a waiter from a restaurant way up in the mountains where the food was cheap and absolutely delicious that the food at our hotel was awful he said it was becsuse they themselves have a lady that slow cooks their food for hours where as the large hotels just mass produce mixing large amouts of food in big pots in a short time. Please be adviced this hotel serves pork which we found out on our 2nd to last day. I asked a waitress and she told me that they serve pork sausages. I was so shocked that I went to reception and asked Fatamah and she asured me that the restaurant didn't serve pork and I should ask the cheif. When I asked the cheif he was so embarrassed when he said no we don't serves pork sausages only bacon at breakfast time! Why he thinks there's a difference is beyond me! When the guest leave their dining tables the waiters often wipe off the crumbs NOT clean the spillages and then re set the dirty table leaving the previous guest napkins glass and cutlery if they look relatively clean. Also the staff are not consistent with their people skills. Some will greet you and smile others will not really bother. This is a French speaking hotel and some of the staff struggle with English. The drinks menu was only in French so when we asked the bar staff to recommend a non alcohol cocktail they let us know by their attitude that they were not interested in helping us. In the end we just had this standard concoction that was premixed that they had in a large container at the bar. Now SHARIF the concierge is the reason to visit this hotel he alone makes this hotel 5*. He will go out of his way to make your stay as comfortable and as enjoyable as possible. If reception says no ask Sharif and if it's possible he will say yes. He arranges excellent trips at good prices where you get to taste proper flavoursome Moroccan food and he is so warm and friendly. If you need to get to the souks after shuttle hours he will arrange this. He is very accommodating has years or experie nce in his field and you can tell that he actually enjoys his job. He recommends trips that he knows are enjoyable he won't send you on any ripoff boring trips. In contrast to other staff members on the morning when we were leaving at 7am the man at reception saw us carrying our luggage and didn't even acknowledge us not even to say good morning how did you enjoy your stay? Please come again nor did he say goodbye. He just gave us our bill and asked for the money for the local tax which came to just over £13 each person. When our transfer car arrived and our driver came in to collect our bags we could see that he was surprised to see the receptionist sitting at his desk and not getting anyone to help us with a luggage trolly which should be standard practice and the hotel we stopped at next had a porter helping their guest with all their bags. Unfortunately we have no intentions of returning to this hotel and would suggest that anyone that does visit makes it priority to speak to Sharif. Sharif for you alone we give 5*! Thank you for making our visit to Marrakech an enjoyable one. Jazak Allah khar,Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deee1
Kenzi Menara Palace,KatieG93 wrote a review Aug 2015,30,"Rooms are superb, food not so great",Stayed at Kenzi Menara with my fiance 7th August for 1 week. The transfer from the airport was a 10 minute journey which was brilliant. On arrival to the hotel it was a quick and very relaxed check in. When we walked into the room there was nothing you could fault. Large spacious and beautiful fresh flowers. We had a garden view which was lovely.  You could always get a sunbed by the pool any time of the day. The pool boys were great most days some days we asked for the cushions to go on the sunbed and one particular day we asked 10 times and had to wait 2.5 hours for them to bring 2 cushions over. The pool was lovely cleaned every morning and a big relief from the sun!!  Food - I would not recommend this hotel at all regarding the food. Breakfast was OK lunch we didn't even bother going too as the first few days we walked in and straight back out and dinner we barely ate as there was very little choice. I wouldn't say the food was horrible there was just limited choice. If you didn't like what the main meal was then you would have to go hungry. We contemplated ordering room service but we had paid enough to go all inclusive we were reluctant to spend more money on food. The pool snack bar food was brilliant and very very nice - however this only serves food 3-5pm so we ate here late most days so this covered lunch and dinner. We were glad to go to Jeema El Fna Square so we could get a KFC!! Speaking of this square just be very careful of the women - I had read reviews about them grabbing to and trying to henna tattoo you so I was wary. This lady approached me and literally grabbed my hand and started to draw I pulled away and she then said she will get it off for me and grabbed my hand again and started to put more ink on me!!!!  The hotel itself was lovely and I would rate this a 4 star hotel however the food really did let the hotel down. The staff were lovely but they treated the French with much better care than the English. We found if we ordered a drink and then the French ordered we would be served second.  We booked the hotel within 3 weeks of travelling as my fiance is in the Royal Navy so we ended up paying a high price to stay here and I don't believe we got value for money. I always read reviews before I book hotels and there were plenty of brilliant reviews and the only bad ones were regarding the food which I thought is a personal thing to you whether you do or don't enjoy however I wish I listened as I feel I wasted a lot of money for not being able to eat much during the week.  It was a lovely week away however we will not be returning to this hotel.,Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatieG93
Kenzi Menara Palace,Luqman Y wrote a review Aug 2015,50,Awesome,Me and 2 others just got back from Marrakech last week. Stayed at Kenzi and I must say all 3 of us throughly enjoyed it. Our room was big and spacious with a fantastic pool view. All the staff were really friendly even the security staff but I must say the guest relations lady Imane was superb. She especially took time out to come over to talk to us regularly making sure everything is ok. Little things like sitting us down at a table in the restaurant to chatting by the pool. Always smiling and welcoming and fun to talk to. All the staff were great but special thanks to Imane for making our stay better than we expected. She's a credit to the hotel.

Kenzi Menara Palace,anisah111 wrote a review Aug 2015,50,simply amazing!!,This is the first review I am writing and what a place to start with! My mum and I recently stayed at Kenzi menara for a week to celebrate my birthday and were blown away! This hotel lived up to expectations and so much more- making it a truly unforgettable experience. From the moment we stepped into Kenzi till we checked out undoubtedly we were treated like royalty! Where to begin!!... the staff at Kenzi are some of the most humble and nicest people we have ever met and made us feel so comfortable during our stay. Now there's no way we can talk about Kenzi menara without mentioning the infamous Mr Cherif!! There's a reason he is mentioned repeatedly in everyone's reviews- my mum and I cannot thank him enough for everything he did for us(thankyou for my birthday cake!!:)) He is such a genuine down to earth person and is truly an asset to Kenzi if anyone is staying at Kenzi this is the man you need to meet! Also there was a lovely lady named Kauther who checked us in who was always at hand to sort out anything we needed. I wish I could name everyone at Kenzi who made our experience so amazing but I would be here forever! The breakfast staff the cleaners (who do an super job) the porters (Amin you made us laugh a lot!) even the security guards were helpful and one even at hand to take photos for us! haha. My point is I would HIGHLY RECCOMEND this hotel to anyone who wants a comfortable peaceful experience in a luxury hotel where everything is catered for. it is very hard for me to find a fault throughout my stay. Thank you SO much to everyone at Kenzi for making our trip something we will always remember! And a special thank you to Mr Cheriff for going out of his way to make my birthday ever so special! Thank you for the flowers the cake and to all who sang to me! Staying at Kenzi has made us want to visit Marrakech again very soon you left a huge impression on us! Simply amazing.. :),Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anisah111
Kenzi Menara Palace,Joshua M wrote a review Aug 2015,20,"Terrible food, mixed service",This is the first negative review I've left on this site but unfortunately came away from my recent trip extremely disappointed with the quality of this hotel.    Negatives:  - Food: this was probably the biggest disappointment of the holiday and really put a dampener on the whole trip. Buffet food was overcooked soggy and tasteless - almost inedible in many cases. Breakfast was slightly better but the quality of the dinners (including the Italian and Moroccan restaurants the latter of which has an additional charge attached even with the all-inclusive package). Seriously the food was so bad that I ended up getting taxis into the centre of Marrakech in the evening to eat there instead.  - Drinks: pretty basic selection of local spirits nothing special.  - Service: mixed some very good staff but also some who clearly had no idea what was going on. I think that this hotel has made the mistake of confusing eagerness with being organised/competent would often wait 30 minutes for help with something and then 5 people would turn up at once. Room was also not cleaned on one of the days we visited (a problem given that the bath did not drain properly)    Positives:  - Room quality: good overall and interior of hotel was well furnished.    Basically for the price you're paying there are much better holiday options both in Marrakech and elsewhere. This is not a 5 star hotel...,Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/16joshuam

Being a neat freak myself I was so glad to see the constant cleaning from morning till night the beautiful smell when you walk into the reception...blown away it's everywhere.  Food was tastyvaried and in abundance...we never went hungry.  Our suite was amazing spacious and very clean a free mini bar and 2 large Lcd TVs in each room. Home from home.  For that little bit of extra luxury there is the spa gym pool and sauna...wife and kids loved it...  The only thing I would like to of seen would of been the outside pool bar open at night with a little music...

Kenzi Menara Palace,Dave H wrote a review Aug 2015,50,What a blast!,Well firstly let me say I have never written a review before good or bad in relation to a holiday however I feel compelled to write this and I am still on the holiday! My wife and booked the holiday very late as we both have very busy careers and we also needed to renew our passports and were not sure if we'd get them in time. All fell into place and we found ourselves at the Kenzi Menari Palace in Marrakech. From walking through the doors on day one to writing this on day 10 the experience here has been fantastic. As has been said in many of the reviews the staff are very friendly every day we have been approached by a manager who has asked if everything is OK and if there is anything more that they can do for us and I really must mention Mohamed Moussaid (Directeur de Restauration) who not only spent time getting to know us but arranged a wonderful night for me to celebrate my birthday. I have never before seen a hotel director take off his suit jacket to help the staff clear tables and serve customers when the restaurant got busy great leader.    I also need to make mention of the food which is outstanding but the absolute star of the show are the pastries and deserts (thank goodness for the gym)! I had the real pleasure of meeting the pastry chef Abdelilah Ennirri who is a young chef who is passionate and extremely talented and an exceptionally nice guy. The creations he makes are delicious and he really honoured and surprised me when he made a brilliant birthday cake for me and he and the staff and some Moroccan musicians then sang happy birthday to me great memory to treasure.  The bar staff are great they work long hours but are always smiling and joking and of course the man who is mentioned so many times in these reviews Sherrif he is everything you read here and more as a concierge. One cautionary note: he invited me to go running with him early one morning which I did he runs marathons so beware! He is a great guy who can't do enough for you if you go he will find you and make your stay wonderful.  I have read some reviews that say the staff give preferential treatment to French customers we did see a little of this but I believe it's just because the French language is more widely spoken and therefore eases communication. My advice don't be afraid to learn a few words of French and give it a go we found this broke down barriers with staff and we managed to enter into conversation with some of the French guests which was really good.  All said we have had the most wonderful of times here we have a few more days to go and we will be sad to leave this is one of the few places in the world that I have been that has had such an impact and I will definitely be back.,Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davehE7666QL

Kenzi Menara Palace,Omar S wrote a review Aug 2015,40,Every establishment needs a Sheriff!!,Me and partner have just returned from our summer holiday from Kenzi Menera Palace.  We stayed there for 11 nights.    Overall i would rate this hotel a 4 star. It isn't quite up to that wow factor you receive from a 5 start hotel. Nevertheless we enjoyed our stay and (most) staff massively.    Some of the staff sadly let this hotel down. There is a huge inconsistency in the customer service given here you also get the feeling that if you don't speak fluent french you are being spoken about which i cannot stand! some staff members need to remember that all of their customers have worked hard for their holiday looked forward to it all year and don't expect to be treated unfairly! the reception staff were friendly the man that took payment for our hotel was laughing and chatting away with the couple before us spent lots of time talking to them (in french) and when it got to me and my partner he was rathe rude and looked down on us. I am 21 and my partner is 26 but how is he to know who has what sort of money?? he doesn't! the pool staff were again ok but weren't overly friendly however the chaps that give you towels and sort out your sun beds etc were SO friendly!! i wish i knew their names but they were always always always smiling and making sure people were comfortable.    the hotel is gorgeous and the grounds are maintained to such a high standard. The rooms are cleaned daily with new bottle of water left for you each day which was a nice surprise. The cocktails in the hotel are really not great we tried them a few times by different people and found them all to be a cheap version. no fresh fruit they don't really taste how they should and they seem to put a lot of alcohol in them but when you taste them it tastes as if they have put a drop in!    we were bed and breakfast as we didn't want to go to Morocco and eat hotel food unfortunately it rained 3 days/nights and even stormed so we got to try the Moroccan and Italian restaurants. I'd read bad things about the Italian on here but we decided to try it incase people were exaggerating but it really is poor I'm afraid the portion size and the taste/qaulity is bad and expensive for what it is!!!! don't waste your money!!  The Moroccan was beautiful!! and Ali was fantastic. One thing i will say is that it takes a long time to be served as there is literally one waiter!!in both places! Ali handled the pressure fantastically and was brill! thank you!    When we had been there for a few days we went to the Souks and explored we wanted to book the Atlas Mountains and spoke to Sheriff. Now where to start with this absolute professional!! Uncle Sheriff!! any questions or issues you have Sheriff will sort everything out! me and my partner were poorly at separate times for separate issues and Sheriff straight away got a driver to take us to the Pharmacy in both cases without question or debate he had it sorted and kept checking to see how we were. He arranged our trip to the Atlas Mountains (definitely go on this trip you will not be disappointed) he also resolved an issue we had and went above and beyond to make sure we were left happy. Due to the way he and a manager dealt with our issue i won't go into the details as it was something that was not caused by them but was handled badly to start with by the night staff but as soon as Sheriff heard of what had happened he was straight onto us to get everything resolved. He called over a manager at the hotel who acted promptly and turned the situation around.    Sheriff is an absolute credit to the hotel if it wasn't for Sheriff our stay would not have been as great as it was. Since we have come home he has been mentioned every single time. He has so much information and a fantastic refreshing sense of humour and made us feel incredibly welcome and at ease in the crazy city! He has a lovely way about him that is so genuine it is never forced. Every business needs their very own Sheriff!!!!!!!    overall we would happily return! The weather was just bad luck and the locals said they can't remember the last time it rained there!    i would recommend staying here but definitely book a Pool View room and not a garden view as i know some can over look the road and be very noisy!!    you won't be disappointed and any issues save for the daytime staff the pool is lovely too it huge and again the whole place is very clean! the entertainment staff were absolutely great they got adults involved in water sports and excersize and had the kids dancing playing football and ping pong!    we are a young couple and this hotel manages to keep the balance between family and couples very well. I can't put my finger on how the do it but do not be put off if you are also a couple as it does not feel like you are surrounded by kids!    Ps. when you stay you must visit Cafe L'Arabe - great food on a lovely rooftop terrace. Lovely staff and great ambiance for drinks as you watch the sunset. I would also recommend Barakka for simply amazing food a little expensice for Marrakesh but not for the experience you will have highly recommend,Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/omars447
Kenzi Menara Palace,Gagen K wrote a review Aug 2015,50,Brilliant holiday for 5 female travelers,Prior to flying out out of my five group of friends I was the most apprehensive about our booked trip to Marrakesh. However as soon as we walked into the beautiful hotel all my worries seemed to vanish.    The hotel itself was gorgeous and we felt as if the price we paid was infact not enough (however being students we wasn't complaining). The hotel staff were helpful and at times went out of their way to ensure we traveled safely (esp one who drove us to a local club past 1am in the hotel minibus).    The rooms were spacious and beautiful we had a triple room and double room attached. This just added to our holiday as it meant that as a group of 5 we didn't have to split up. One problem that we kept experiencing was with our room key card- which at the best of times proved to be really annoying.    The food at breakfast was nice but as this is a primarily family hotel we were shocked at the amount of time it took to have us seated as a group of 5. Some of the staff at breakfast were quite inattentive and on one occasion we had to request for some coffee three times ( and for us early morning caffeine fiends that was enough to tip us over the edge).    As a typical girl of my generation my constant need to be connected to wifi whenever (freely) available was hindered by the slow connection offered by the hotel    We booked the majority of our excursions through the hotel- dealing in particular with Cheriff. Although on meeting him he was quite obnoxious (we shouldn't have told him we read raving reviews on him) he put together a itinerary for our group. One word of advise is to actually engage with the hotel guests as they may already have an idea of what they want to do during their stay. Although once we made it clear to him what we wanted to do he did offer us great itinerary alternatives.    I have to admit I was extremely impressed with all our excursions booked through Cheriff the car and drivers were pleasant and the destinations for things like quad biking was absolutely mindblowing! - So a big thank you to Cheriff (I myself have now become that raving trip advisor fan!)    A must do in Marrakesh is the Atlas Mountain collectively one of the most best experiences we had as a group.    I would love to come back and hopefully see the development made in that area in particular and I can safely say my friends agree.    Thank you Kenzi Menara Palace & Cherrif for one of our best holidays!

There was a very relaxed sit down registration process with a friendly and helpful manager. This hotel is right on the edge of Marrakech in the new hotel quarter.    Rooms  VERY large rooms well decorated. dark wood with terrace or balcony. Individual shower wc bath and dual basin. 2 huge beds are pushed together to make a mega double bed.    Food  Plentiful and varied. Only minor point is that the Moroccan spices do make most tangines taste the same. Waiter staff friendly and helpful. Amazingly all-inclusive includes a very decent choice of local wines. The only negative is that you can't eat a snack at the pool bar until 3pm but you can have a 3 course meal !!!!

We were there with our 15 year old son and 10 year old daughter and they had a great time too. Zakaria is the pool entertainer and he was really great and very friendly. He always made an effort.

Our room was first class and so were the staff who were friendly and polite. No complaints at all. When it comes to buying from the market you must have your wits about you as I am convinced that the prices are increased by 50% so be careful and shop around in order to get a guide of the right price to pay as a lot of the time items have no price.  We lost out on currency conversion when we exchanged at Gatwick so I fully recommend getting local currency at the hotel cash machine. Gatwick gave us 11 MD to the pound and took commission whereas the hotel cash machine gave a rate of 14.45MD to the pound!

Kenzi Menara Palace,11S1 wrote a review Aug 2015,40,"Really lovely, perhaps wrong time of year",This holiday was a complete surprise treat for me and I didn't know an awful lot about it until I was there.  My partner booked this with Expedia and he was under the impression we were on an all inclusive rate however on arrival found out we weren't (Be very careful when booking with Expedia - i don't recommend it the holiday far more expensive). The prices as this hotel are extremely expensive if you aren't all inclusive. We decided to pay the extra with the hotel and the staff were really helpful when getting this sorted out.    Our room was fantastic very big with a gorgeous pool view. Cleaned everyday and the mini bar is also refilled everyday.    The food was all inclusive and that included the buffet and Italian restaurant and we paid a supplement for the Moroccan restaurant. The buffet had enough choice and there were deserts. The Italian was nice enough apart from the soup however the Moroccan restaurant was by far the best and the service was fantastic. The pool bar served food during the day however besides one waiter (small always wearing a cap) the others weren't really interested.    Considering we were all inclusive the hotel doesn't seem to make you feel like you can eat and drink when you want to as you would normally expect at an all inclusive.    The hotel itself was very quiet and this we think was down to it being Ramadan the week we were there. There was no entertainment in the evening and no music in the buffet area. However on our last day (end of Ramadan) things did seem to pick up. The staff were happier there was more food choice and there was music during the day and evening entertainment.    The pool was great however the paint on the stairs came off on our expensive swimwear which was annoying as it left white marks that didn't come off after sitting on the pool steps.    We went to the Souks via the free shuttle bus with the hotel and did a trip up the Atlas mountains via a Taxi the hotel arranged. (both separately reviewed).    The reception staff can't do enough for you and are really helpful.    The hotel itself is beautiful and I think it would have been a very different place when it isn't Ramadan. Would certainly go again and recommend the pool view room. Supermarket just around the corner.    Hotel ideal for those looking to just chill out.,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Deganwy, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/11S1
Kenzi Menara Palace,Pooja M wrote a review Jul 2015,40,Marrakesh and excursions,We booked this hotel relatively last minute as part of a package deal. The hotel is 10 min away from the medina and 10 min from the airport. Costs about 50 dh to get here and maybe a bit more in the evening. It's a great location if you prefer being away from the hussle of the city and there is also a shuttle bus that runs a few times a day to the medina. ( be there early as the bus only holds 7-8 people). It's a really lovely hotel and the pool area is chilled out and not too busy so you can relax! The staff are super helpful and friendly. In particular Sharif helped us plan out a couple of days in Marrakech suggesting activities such as going to see the palaces gardens and city tour with a driver for the day as well as planning a trip to the Atlas Mountains which was super fun! ( take trainers if you plan on going there to climb up to the waterfall). The breakfast had a very large variety of food but we probably only had a few things that looked appetising to us. The chefs do make fresh omelettes which is great!,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/poojapm8911
Kenzi Menara Palace,Ria150 wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Superb birthday *****,I stayed at the Kenzi Menara for my birthday in January. It was a beautiful weekend. The hotel was very quiet but the staff still were vere attentive.  We were delightfully upgraded to a suite which made my birthday weekend even more enjoyable.  Food was divine and due to the low numbers in the hotel they removed the buffet styled meals. The Al a carte menu made dinner more special with an intimate atmosphere.  I will definitely be returning back to this hotel as I would like to experience the holiday atmosphere of being by the pool. This was being refurbished during the time I was there.  Overall this is a hotel with great experience on providing great hospitality throughout.  May I take this opportunity to thank you for helping to make my 40th birthday memorable.,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ria150
Kenzi Menara Palace,allthebaconandeggs wrote a review Jul 2015,40,Fantastic experience,My friend and I chose to stay at the Kenzi Menara Palace for 5 nights because we wanted to combine city break and a relaxing holiday. We were not disappointed.    The hotel is less than ten minutes from the airport by taxi. We arrived to find we had booked a king size bed and we were immediately offered a twin bed. The hotel smelt amazing and it was immaculate.    ROOM - As with the rest of the hotel our room was impressively clean and spacious. We really enjoyed our ground floor balcony with a garden view. My only complaint is that I had a backache on the first two nights on the twin bed but I was comfortable for the remainder.    FOOD - In contrast to several reviews on here I found there to be a large selection for breakfast. There were no flies on the food but a bird would occasionally fly in! They do have English breakfast tea but why have that in Morocco? Ask for mint tea!  My friend is a vegetarian so we did not eat in the Moroccon restaurant.  We went to the Italian restaurant on the first and third nights. The food was fresh enjoyable well presented and reasonably priced. I left my scarf in the restaurant and the waiter ran out of the restaurant after me with it to give it back.  The pool food was basic pizzas burgers club sandwiches.  We didn't opt for an all inclusive option as we wanted to try food in the medina and the new city.    LOCATION - Close to both the airport medina and the new city the hotel's location was very convenient. I really enjoyed being able to come back from the overwhelming sights sounds and smells from the medina and relax at the pool. This was a great contrast.  There is a shopping centre nearby and we enjoyed just exploring the supermarket and watching the every day Moroccan life. Ice cream was 65p too.  The hotel is a five minute walk from some of the biggest nightclubs including Pacha.    POOLS - A huge asset to the hotel. The surrounding gardens were also beautiful. The larger pool was cooler. Not as many people used the smaller warmer pool. My friend and I had a fantastic afternoon in the pool after a busy day. The pool bar staff brought us wine. We found the staff to be jovial and really helpful. If you're friendly and chatty the staff are really responsive.  I can't talk about the pool without mentioning Zac. He was so friendly and enthusiastic. He's a real credit to the hotel as he made everyone smile. He encouraged us to participate in water aerobics water polo and table tennis. We had an impromptu dancing session one evening with Zac led by Assad (sorry if his name is wrong) who was also wonderful.  My only complaint was that after a windy night there were a lot of leaves and some paper in the pool that hadn't been removed in the morning.    EXCURSIONS - There is a free shuttle that runs between the hotel and the medina. The last shuttle back is at 715 so you have to make your own way back. One of our shuttle drivers arranged our private trip to the Atlas Mountains (a must) for 400 dirhams each. A group tour is cheaper. We didn't go to the waterfalls but a couple we met did and weren't warned of the extra charge for a guide to the waterfall - so always confirm prices and ask questions!  Our driver looked after us and offered to stop so we could take pictures. We stopped at just one seller of jewellery but we didn't feel as hassled as we did at the souks to buy anything. We also stopped a cafe on the stream which was clearly not optional. We had a three course meal for 120 dirham sitting in the water with a beautiful backdrop so we didn't mind.    We visited the souks (another must) but I would recommend arranging a trustworthy guide beforehand. We had mint tea and tagine in a cafe overlooking the square for about 75 dirhams. We also wandered to the twelfth century mosque near the square and wandered the gardens.    Sharif also arranged a private taxi for the day (200 dirhams each - £13!) so we could see the Majorelle Gardens Bahia Palace El Badi Palace and the Saadi tombs. Entry to most of these places was 65p. No guide is required. El Badi Palace was stunning! It was a shame that some people rarely ventured out of the hotel. I wish we had seen some of the other gardens cafes and museums in retrospect.    We also booked a camel ride through Sharif and it was great fun and surprisingly comfortable. The company who arranged the rides had brilliant staff. We were also taught how to make mint tea    He also arranged for us to go to the Red House for our last evening meal. It was a stunning building the food brilliant and the staff attentive. We even found ourselves joining in with the belly dancer. His English is impressive and he had us in stitches after playing a prank on us!    Overall I cannot fault the hotel on its cleanliness and facilities. The staff were generally very attentive and made us feel very comfortable. There were some staff who have been mentioned who went the extra mile to make us feel at home and we would come back for that experience.    Having been to the hotel I know that some of the more negative reviews on here are from people who were not as engaging with the staff or who did not want to explore Marrakech. So please don't be put off by negative people. Embrace it and you'll have an incredible experience at both the hotel and in the city.,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Letchworth Garden City, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allthebaconandeggs
Kenzi Menara Palace,Arun P wrote a review Jul 2015,40,Very relaxing week's vacation,We have recently returned from our first trip to Marrakech. The décor of the hotel was very traditional and elegant. The pool and poolside bar is where we spent the majority of our time to cool off in the extreme heat. For the first couple of days we faced some problems which left us slightly frustrated. Our rooms were extremely spacious but the AC in one of the interconnecting rooms barely worked. We made repeated complaints to reception but even though the maintenance team claimed to have fixed the problem the AC stopped again in the middle of the night. Eventually we asked to speak with the manager and were introduced to the Guest Relations Manager Imane who came to our rescue. She proved to be extremely considerate  and helpful. She personally attended with the maintenance team to look into the problem with the AC and having concluded that it was not working properly arranged for us to be moved to alternative interconnecting rooms and even helped us move our luggage. Throughout the remainder of our stay we noted that she made special efforts to do the rounds and chat to guests to ensure everyone was happy and enjoying their vacation. Thank you very much Imane for your assistance and truly professional service.  Another member of staff requiring special mention is Sharif the concierge. We wanted to arrange some trips and he was extremely friendly knowledgeable and helpful in organising these for us. We opted for a tour of the beautiful botanical gardens palace and souks (Old City) as well as a trip to the Atlas Mountains (which was the kids' favourite).  As we are vegetarian food was a bit of a problem in terms of variety. The Italian restaurant food wasn’t really authentic enough but was decent. The everyday main buffet didn’t offer a great variety for us as it was always rice and vegetable tagine for us. Having said that there was plenty of fresh fruit on offer and the selection of deserts couldn’t really be faulted.  Overall although we initially encountered some problems our stay was highly enjoyable and very relaxing and we would certainly consider going back.,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arunp690
Kenzi Menara Palace,Stella O wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Excellent 4 night stay,My daughter and I returned last week from a 4 night trip to Marrakech and stayed at the superb Kenzi Menara Palace Hotel. From our being picked up by the hotel shuttle from the airport and the warm and courteous welcome we recieved from all the staff I knew we had picked well. The hotel is in an excellent location just 10-15mins by taxi to the Medina square. The hotel actually has a curtesy shuttle bus which takes guest to to square starting around 9am and finishing at 7pm. There is also a pleasant shopping mall just a short walk round the back of the hotel. I had initially booked a garden view room but the we were given overlooked the main road as well so I asked if I could change my room type and I was given a free upgrade to a pool view room. Talking of the rooms they are huge and well furnished the bathrooms are actually bigger than some other hotel bedrooms that I have stayed in. The hotel grounds are well looked after and the cleanliness could not be faulted. Staff were forever mopping scrubbing wipeing or sweeping at all times of the day and night. As I had booked the hotel and flights separately we did not have the services of a rep to tell us about the attractions of Marrakech but none was needed because Cheriff the concierge who I had read so many good things about in earlier reviews lived up to his reputation and sorted us out with trips and recommendations of places to eat in the evening. A particular favourite being the Red House which is situated about 5mins away from the Medina square and souks. My daughter and I throughly enjoyed our trip to Marrakech and our stay at the Kenzi Menara Palace which was excellent value for the price we paid. A return trip with my partner is definitely on my agenda.,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stellao712
Kenzi Menara Palace,Becky W wrote a review Jul 2015,30,Good hotel,We have just returned from 4 nights at this hotel. It is close to the airport and a taxi will cost around 100 mad. We visited during Ramadan so found it to be very quiet in the evenings. There was no entertainment or music which wasn't a problem as we were only there for a few days but may have been if we were staying for longer. We loved spending our days laying by the huge pool which was lovely to cool off in. We were originally given a room overlooking a car park so we asked if they had any more rooms available and the reception staff moved us to a ground floor room looking towards the pool which we appreciated. The food was not as good as we had hoped for the pool bar was nice but we found breakfast and dinner a bit disappointing. There was not much choice for dinner and sometimes the food was cold. We ate in the Italian restaurant for 2 nights as we preferred the food. Room service and the mini bar are included in all inclusive which was a nice surprise. We had a lovely full body massage in the spa for around £30 so nice that we had another the next day as well!

Kenzi Menara Palace,Patricia F wrote a review Jul 2015,40,An oasis in the desert,First time in Marrakech and at this hotel. Went with my husband for a relaxing short break.  Our room was absolutely fantastic spacious with the view of the grounds and pool.  The veranda was also one of the biggest I have seen.  Only complaint is the shower or better said the lack of a shower. We had a bath with a shower head which I had to sit in the bath to wash my hair. Would have expected at least a small shower space as the bathroom was very spacious.  The swimming pool area is the highlight of the hotel. Plenty of sun bed towels and parasol. The swimming pool restaurant offered a basic menu but it was ok for a light meal during the day. Loved the birds and the peaceful atmosphere that it provided. There are plenty of space and shade which in the scorching heat was a blessing.  Staff are very friendly and helpful most will speak English as well as French.  The main restaurant was good variety of food was ok not the best one I have experienced but every night they provided with different options. The moroccan restaurant is not included in the all inclusive and a charge of 100MAD per person applies. Which in my opinion is not worth at all. The food wasn't the best the choice limited and the service was lacking.  If you want to taste the local culinary I recommend the main restaurant is free and it's as good as the other restaurant.

Imane on guest relations was the best guest relations person I have ever came across in my travels she always made a point of coming to talk to guests to ensure you were happy with everything. Met us & seated us personally in the Moroccan & Italian restaurant . Imane even offered us her services to take us on her day off to take us to the souks.  The cashier Nour was very helpful with letting us have a later check out after Imane had extended from the normal check out. I found the receptionist smiley & welcoming (Fatima & Poho). They seem like one big happy family and all seem like a lovely group of staff that compliment each other. Sherif organised a day trip to the Atlas Mountains which was one of our best days. The driver looked after us very well. We had a fabulous holiday and this is because we stayed at the Kenzi such a clean relaxing vibe I can't wait to go back. A must to do is get the shuttle bus from the hotel into the Madina & explore the souks. Pool area is clean and plenty of beds and friendly guy who made us laugh every day....

The food in the Italian restaurant was a good experience for the eyes but even so I managed to get really sick by the food.

Excellent large room with good modern decor and large well proportioned bathroom with an excellent shower. Pleasant balcony large enough to sit out on. The bed was good as was the wifi. The pool / bar area was pleasant although the service a little slow at times. The gardens were beautiful and well maintained top marks to the gardeners.    Check in and out was again a little slow not helped by the fact I was given directions to the opposite side of the hotel to my room.

Over all staff are approachable however there is inconsistency in getting what u want. Breakfast worth having but lunch and evening meal was not up to the standard of a five star hotel. We felt the Italian was the best place to eat overall. Drink for all inclusive is local brands which it did not say anywhere in the information shared. This would be ok if the prices of wanting to pay for a brand was not so expensive.  Great pool area and sun beds. I was not over impressed by the spa i felt was not five star but the hamman and massage was very good and worth trying.  I felt the room was a little dark but furniture was nice and overall comfortable.  Taxis from the hotel charge a lot more than if you go out and pick one up.

The hotel itself is nice Staff are attentive and the grounds are quite well kept they also have a very nice big pool and a smaller one for adults I believe. The rooms are very large and cleaned daily. We had a garden view room which again was fine. Service at the pool bar was a bit hit and miss on the first day but after handing over a few tips it became better. I don't mind giving tips but would appreciate not having to give it to receive good service. I prefer to reward for good service.  We went over Ramadan which we are told is why the hotel was quiet. Unfortunately there was no entertainment the reason for this was that the singer was on holiday ( not sure why he/she couldn't be replaced) There was also no background music at all so it was extremely quiet in the evenings.  The buffet food was cold and not very varied. The best meal of the day was breakfast where we could get a hot omelette or poached egg. The rest of it wasn't very appetising. The food at the pool bar was decent and better than the buffet. We went one night to the Italian restaurant and unfortunately two of the people in our party were very ill all night and the following day. We did inform the hotel guest relations lady who was very nice and offered us a free spa - we didn't take this up because we only had limited time. The gesture was appreciated though.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Mike A wrote a review Jul 2015,40,"Lovely hotel and grounds, shame about the food.",We have just returned from a 6 night stay at the Menara Palace and had a lovely trip. We had some pre-conceived worries about visiting during ramadan surrounding dress food and drink - these were completely unfounded and it was a fantastic experience to enjoy the culture.    ROOMs - we stayed in a double room and it was huge modern with a warm Moroccan design. Duvets provided however the pillows were not that comfortable. I ended up using the second duvet as a make shift pillow (note to hotel please invest in some comfy pillows!!). We were next to the main road not a massive issue but the noise of sports bikes racing up and down the road at 3am got tiresome. Mini bar topped up daily and the hotel maids did an excellent job of keeping the room very clean.    POOL/POOL AREA - biggest asset to the hotel in my opinion. There is 1 olympic sized pool (very big) and a smaller (warmer) pool. The sun beds were very comfortable and plentiful and the pool boys were pretty quick to bring over towels and help with putting up the umbrellas. Fairly good range of drinks at the bar and we really enjoyed the bar food which was served from midday.    FOOD - overall the food was so so. We thought the buffet food was quite average and on one evening saw the chef kicking around the dining area - surely his time could have been better spent serving up freshly cooked meats etc.. The Italian restaurant offered a good range of dishes and were tasty the Mozzarella starter was brilliant. The Moroccan restaurant felt very traditional and well played out however the menu only offered 2 options for starter 2 mains 2 desert - not ideal given the 100 Dirham surcharge on top of the all inclusive but the food here was good. Main advise here would be to at least book the Italian or Moroccan restaurant or eat out in the Medina.    EXCURSIONS - The legendary Sharif organised 2 excursions for us. As other people have noted he is a great asset to the hotel very friendly and eager to ensure you have a good time. One excursion was a private tour around the Souks (300 dirhams). So glad we had a guide as very easy to get lost. The Souks were vibrant and very interesting. The tour involved being invited into various shops where you will be presented with a number of products that the shop owner will push on you. Be prepared for this some are very persuasive and will get disappointed if you don't buy anything. Do not ask for the price if you do not want to buy to avoid haggling once you start its extremley hard to walk away as the shop owners think you are interested. Second excursion was the High Atlas Mountains. Private tour is 800 dirhams group tour is 400 dirhams. We did the group tour which turned out to be private anyway (low season)! Again as with the Souks tour you are driven to various shops on the way where you are given a quick tour and then encouraged to buy something. This did become tiresome after a while and I'm pretty sure the tour company get some form a kick back for anything you purchase. The Berber house we saw was fantastic and the house owner applied no pressure to give them money - therefore we donated some cash house and bought something from their shop. More stop offs where some children were basically begging for money and we only had big notes which made this situation awkward. We were driven to a restaurant for lunch which we didn't want to go to and then told it was going to cost 300 dirhams on top of the original excursion price. Overall the scenery was pleasant but really not that amazing. More history surrounding the berber villages would have been interesting to learn about. We actually asked the driver to take us back to the hotel early as we were fed up with the pressure to constantly buy things we didn't want and the constant hassle from the locals to give them money. Going privately makes this worse as all the attention is on you.    Overall fantastic hotel for a week getaway and the weather was outstanding. Would recommend the hotel but research the excursions thoroughly before booking. Try and take advantage of restaurants outside the hotel.,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/earleeriser

He also told us the taxi prices for all the places we wanted to go so we were never over charged. He is just perfect! Our rooms were beautiful over looking the gorgeous pool.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Usman I wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Excellent Memories,This is my first trip to Morocco (Marrakech) and the hotel stay will remain fresh in our memories. We are Asian family based in the UK. Excellent breakfast great facilities shopping nearby hourly dropoff and pickup from the square three swimming pools... keep on adding. Two things stand out #1 Sharif he had been so helpful throughout our stay and a very honest man. #2 - why search for authentic Tagine anywhere else the lamb tagine which had in the hotel was the best in the whole stay. One thing the hotel could improve is by providing a common iron room for the guests and have a slightly softer mattress. I would definitely recommend this hotel.,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Luton, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/225usmani
Kenzi Menara Palace,farhad684 wrote a review Jul 2015,40,Sharif Head Concierge he is a credit to this HOTEL!,"My firs trip to Morocco Marrakesh with a few of my very close friends from London. I loved Marrakesh its a city filled with history and excellent local bazaar and a few excellent clubs if that's your cup of tea.    More to the point regarding - The Kenzi Menara Place gave me and my friends a mixed view on how we rated the hotel. There was always an element of attention to detail missing from all aspects of service - for example pillow with missing pillow cover despite having reported this nothing was done but it was ok because there was a spare pillow in the cuboard....    The main thing you should take away from this review is one gentleman named ""Sharif"" is was because of Sharif that I rate this hotel excellent - his English is excellent - nothing is ever too much for him - just ask anything from him and he will ensure it is done. I really admired Sharif's passion and professionalism. He is a credit to this Hotel and its because of him we shall be returning.    Some points about Sharif  Sharif arranged some medicine to be sent to my room when I was ill - thank you very much indeed Sharif and Ramadan Kareem my friend.  He arranged for me and my friends a private Atlas mountain trips (one of the best trips I have been on in my life (MAKE SURE YOU CEHCK IT OUT)  Arranged our private transfer from and to the hotel.  Arrange transfer to and from the mosque for Friday prayer  Mint tea and biscuits on arrival  Referred us to one of the finest restaurant is Marrakesh it was in a private riad (hidden Gem)    the list goes on and on....

Kenzi Menara Palace,sunseasmile wrote a review Jun 2015,40,Nice hotel,Currently staying at this hotel we are about halfway through our stay. As other reviewers have said its clean people are lovely. The rooms are a very good size and the grounds well kept with an army of people who work really hard. I think the following would improve the hotel:    1) Main restaurant - fairly good selection of food. Difficultly is that as a vegetarian I can't not always identify what has meat in dishes. The food especially the salads could be labelled simply by saying 'suitable for vegetarians'. I found fish in the dish labelled vegetable tagine.    2) food should be covered - we found flies buzzing in the grated carrots when we disturbed them lifting the serving spoon. Also found flies on the freshly cut oranges. I suggest the hotel look at the food serving more carefully.    They could learn a few things from visiting good standard hotels in the Middle East.    Apart from the above the spa is fantastic - cost for a 50 minute oil massage is 500 Dhs (£34). I would highly recommend the spa the therapists are excellent.    Wifi works very well.    The hotel Concierge Sharif is brilliant. We arranged our trips through him.

Kenzi Menara Palace,staz875 wrote a review Jun 2015,40,Lovely hotel,Stayed here with my husband and 17 month old baby bed and breakfast from 16th june until 27th june.  Hotel looks 5 stars absolutely beautiful decor and rooms are just beautiful and very spacious.  Service is not a 4 star but staff do work hard and are very nice.  We had requested a cot but was not in our room on arrival had to call twice for cot but not a problem  Breakfasts in the morning was nice but by the end of the holiday I was fed up eating the same stuff each morning but still lovely and presentation was lovely.  Pool and pool bar staff fantastic the man at the pool was so helpful with towels and parasoles and some days was standing at beds for us preparing them for us I am so sorry but I do not know your name but thankyou. Lamia at the pool bar was lovely took a liking to my wee one and gave her some orange juice and food how kind thankyou.  Plenty of sunbeds never struggled to get one and always towels available. 2 pools a big one with a wee shallow bit attached and a smaller pool we used all pools all very nice water colder in bigger pool so my wee one preferred the smaller pool as water not so cold.  One night we decide to eat in the hotel at the international resturant which was a buffet was 300 dirhams per person a little expensive food was ok good variety though. But we had went down with the baby at 730 as we were told dinner was 730 but due to ramadan this had changed to 830 my wee one is only 17 months do we were very disappointed I was a little upset but the situation was quickly fixed and a male a female sorry again no name sent my little one some bread and vegetables with potatoes to the room for her to eat and we had room service that nice while baby was asleep.  Room service actually really good compared to other 4 5 star hotels price wise comes to room on beautiful table with a lovely flower on the table.  Rooms cleaned every single day with fresh bottles of water each day and some days cleaners would leave towel designs with some petals beautiful.  The day after we arrived we had gone to a supermarket close by to get the baby some milk and snack and on the way back into the hotel we got into trouble and told off for bring stuff back in which was not allowed I was not very happy as I was not all inclusive and my wee one needed things.  Mini bar In room not free but we used it to keep babies milk cold prices good for mini bar.  Concierge sheriff very nice but also a very busy man english very good and he was very good to my wee one gave her a wee box of cakes one day and a little wooden camel when we were leaving he also arrange a horse n cart ride for us which was beautiful he had told us it would be 100 dirhams an hour but was 200 but very well worth it and beautiful.  Currency exchange in hotel brilliant and again I am sorry no name but the young man at cashier was fantastic wore glasses spoke 5 languages he was so nice and friendly.  Do not dine in the Italian service soooo slow and food not great value for money only 2 staff members on who were run off there feet.  Overall hotel was gorgeous and I would defo recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to go to marrakesh as hotel provide free shuttle bus at certain times into the medina short ride taxi to medina also cheap.  I would so do not take your children if they are under 5 as most places do not have high chairs and there are no childrens menus anywhere.

Kenzi Menara Palace,greenjk wrote a review Jun 2015,40,Spa hotel,We have just returned from a weeks holiday. Overall the hotel has great facilities. It is ramadam at the mo so everyone is a bit subdued. The italian restaurant is fantastic and is worth booking. No extra charge if you are all inclusive. The food is tasty and changes nightly so you get a great selection. There is an unusual practice of taking a 2000 dirham deposit when you book in - we were told this was for room service if required. It is fully refunded on check out. However we found that not everyone was charged this even though it was hotel policy. ... they also charged us for staying in marakesh. 400 dirham for local taxes that was not mentioned when we arrived to check in. Its not alot about £30 but was a bit of a shock at 6am when we left. The souk is well worth a trip. It is very overwhelming when you get out of the taxi. You are bombarded by guides.. be polite and keep moving then they will leave you alone. We found that sitting in the French restaurant with a cafe au lait and a coke works wonders for your nerves. Very reasonable 40 dirham. Regroup and go back in. Always haggle. whatever the price they say half it and work up.we had a great time.,Date of stay: June 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/greenjk

The staff were always attentive and helpful and the concierge Cherif did a great job finding tours for us that were within our budget and covered exactly what we wanted to see. The hotel was also very helpful sorting transfers for us to and from our dinner reservations to save us the stress of getting a taxi.    The Riad itself was absolutely beautiful such a calming atmosphere with traditional Moroccan furnishings and you really feel relaxed. The room gardens and pool were all clean and well kept. A great spot for couples and those not wanting a hotel filled with hyperactive children running around!    We will definitely return to Kenzi Menara Palace!

We had room service twice and that was also of a very good standard.

Kenzi Menara Palace,AMC32 wrote a review Jun 2015,50,Lovely place to finish our Marrkech adventure,Having stayed for 2 nights in a traditional Riad and a trip to the Atlas mountains we wanted a couple of nights at a hotel with a Pool to relax on our last day.    We only stayed for 2 nights but the hotel was lovely. It was an international hotel with similar standards you would expect from somewhere like a Hilton for example. The welcome was good and service around the hotel was all fine. We had a cocktail at the bar one evening which was probably the same sort of price as the UK.    Rooms are well presented and the added touch of a duvet is always welcome! Separate shower and toilet in the bathroom and bathrobes were provided.    Location wise we couldn't make use of the shuttle service in the evening as they left too early but taxis were plentiful and about a 10 minute drive from anywhere we were looking to go - we had planned our trip to do the Medina whilst staying at the Riad so were able to explore other locations whilst at this hotel outside of the Medina. Also very close to get back to the airport at the end of our trip.    There are a couple of nik nak shops in the hotel and newsagent style shop. Breakfast was ample and had the usual pancake and omelette station.    The pool is huge and had no trouble getting a sunbed when we stayed. Towels are provided.    Would definitely visit again. I think this hotel depends on what you are hoping to get out of a trip to Marrakech really as to whether it would suit you location wise.,Date of stay: June 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Warwickshire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AMC32
Kenzi Menara Palace,MartineVei wrote a review Jun 2015,40,Perfect for Families,First time in Marrakech I wanted to please the 3 of us: My husband and I wanted a cosy place while my son of 7 wanted a big pool to play. We chose this hotel since it seemed not too big but still allowing kids to play without annoying the other guests.    The hotel is away from the noisy road so it is very quiet. The room we had reserved was very large beautiful and well designed. Very confortable bedding.    we left the patio doors open at night time (I don't support to much AC) and still it was very quiet.    The pool is quite big with a small pool for the kids. The sun beds are nice to relax and allow privacy and shade with the curtains that you can move around. You got plenty of chairs as well so no rush to find a spot at 6 am.    If you have kids and the weather is not very nice to swim out the indoor pool from the spa is available for them to swim for free in the morning. The water is warm and there is some water canons for them to have fun.    The personel is very nice very helpful.    The restaurants are not to our taste. Breakfast is not bad at all a lot of choice. The problem is the crowd. If the hotel is full (like it was when we stayed) you can't find a place to sit (unless you arrive at 7 am). if you arrive too late there is nothing left to eat. The service is not good the personel is too busy and they can't satisfy all guests demands for coffee tea etc... We can feel they are stressed out. Not the atmosphere you search for when you just woke up. So if you want to have good service plenty of food and quiet time go early.    For dinner the Maroccan restaurant is nice. The atmosphere and musicians are the best assets. The food is good but you can find better in the city. Service is very good but there is only a few tables so if you don't reserve you might not have availability.    The Italian restaurant is to avoid. The other restaurant is the buffet one (same as breakfast).    The kids club is lost somewhere in the spa section. It did not appeal to my son even if the place was clean and the lady seemed quite nice. It would be better to have it closer to the pool and the main hotel. Maybe it is different in the summer season?    To resume a good hotel for a first time in Marrakech. Clean comfortable friendly.

We checked into our room which was hard to take in this had to be the best room we've ever stayed in it was very comfortable the only downside was there was no shower only bath with a separate toilet. We were all inclusive and fully enjoyed the food in the dining room which had such variety the pool bar food was nice but basic. The pool although chilly was lovely to dip into on a very hot day there were plenty of loungers with towels supplied on request. The hotel ran a shuttle bus to the town where you can enjoy the market square and souks which is a must to see. We found the staff from reception to cleaners so pleasant and polite.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Lutece1717 wrote a review Jun 2015,50,TWO WEEKS! Fantastic Family Stay,This review is late very late since we stayed at Kenzi Menara Palace last August but I did not forget!!! In fact I'm wanting to return because we had such an excellent time!    First of all I was VERY hesitant to reserve this hotel because normally I prefer to rent vacation apartments/homes when on vacation particularly for 14 nights. Additionally this was a trip with my boyfriend and his two children (7 & 9) so I was having a hard time imagining us all in a normal room for two weeks with no kitchen or laundry room.    As it turned out our room was enormous!! We had plenty of room for everyone with the sleeping area off the living room plus the main bedroom. Both rooms had HUGE balconies facing the pool. And another bonus were TWO toilets! One off the living room and one off the main bathroom. One thing about this hotel's website is that it does not do the property justice in terms of showing how great the rooms are.    We purchased an all-inclusive plan. This was another concern. How in the world could we be happy with their food for 14 nights? We live in Paris most of the year so it's not like we don't enjoy good food. While I am American my boyfriend is Moroccan so he knows this cuisine very well. So as impossible as it sounds we were all happy with our dining choices. We had so much to choose from! Dishes changed constantly - the buffet was never a repeat of the previous days (or even the previous meal!) with always different delightful fresh salads as well as tagines and delicious deserts. The kids and adults were very happy. The last morning at breakfast we all agreed we did not want to leave.    I have to give much credit to the wonderful staff including the servers housekeeping the concierge and the director Mr. Baida who was always actively involved in the resort - I think we saw him nearly every day always smiling and running around. One morning when they were short-staffed we saw him clearing plates during the breakfast service. It's a good sign when the director is actively involved and available to guests.    The pool areas were fantastic. There were plenty of lounge chairs for everyone even when the resort was completely booked - as it was for much of our stay. You did not feel like a sardine crammed in among the other guests.    The only improvement I could suggest is that they improve the quality of the twin beds in the family rooms. I understand that they have to be movable but they were pretty uncomfortable. One of the kids slept on the sofa in the living room instead.    We are all thankful for the time we spent here and I hope to return again someday in the future!,Date of stay: August 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Paris, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lutece1717

Kenzi Menara Palace,Red-wine59 wrote a review Jun 2015,40,Superb Hotel Totally Relaxing,Travelled in the Easter Break first time in Morocco. We usually go for the adult only hotels but decided on this one after checking the reviews and was not disappointed. Smooth pick up at the airport and check in was very relaxing with a glass of Moroccan tea. Room was huge cleaned each day and with a massive bed requested extra pillows which arrived quickly.    The food was buffet but was very good great Moroccan selection. Now I do not usually eat the puddings when away but the desserts during the day and evening meals were lovely could not resist them. Hotel had a BBQ's during the week at lunch time. With being Thomson we had the advantage of the ala carte Italian and Moroccan restaurants included in the price. The Italian was good and a change but the Moroccan was similar to the food served in the hotel restaurant still good but same style.    Pool was the biggest I've seen in a hotel and one of the reasons we picked this hotel was the availability of sun beds on reviews. We never had a problem getting a bed as there is so many of them and the pool staff were quick to bring a towel for you. Staff were very polite and friendly.    If you need anything outside the hotel speak to Cherif the concierge who organised a trip to the souk for about £20..    To sum up a lovely hotel very pristine was always being cleaned and polished good food and staff. If you want to get away and relax this is the place in Morocco.

However; the stay at the Kenzi Menara Hotel far exceeded my expectations; it is a genuinely beautiful hotel!    The only issue was the check-in; a clear break down in communication between the agents & the hotel; needs revisiting but Nour Uddin who clearly was experienced and very professional ensured that it would all be resolved and so it was !    Nour uddin; Abdullah and Hassan from the pool all deserve a special mention; very friendly atentative & were loved by our two special boys; Adam and Ehsan.    The gardens are very well looked after; huge outdoor pool albeit cold; warm indoor pool for young children; Gym; plenty of places to chill and relax.    Restaurants offer a good variety of food albeit take issue with Pork but appreciate the need to cater for all society!    The family room we stayed in was big; separate lounge and a good size bed! The rooms were cleaned everyday and towels changed & replaced. Special mention here for the cleaners who were very prompt when the young child fell ill for a day.    I also liked and enjoyed how the locals came into the hotel at the weekend used the pool and generally mixed in with everyone!    I love Marrakesch.    I will be returning.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Steve P wrote a review May 2015,40,A nice break.,I was one of a party of 16 male golfers who visited the Menara 17/5 for a week. We had a nice week and on the whole the service was good with only 1 or 2 exceptions. I will list the exceptions first then the positives. On our first experience in the Italian restaurant we experienced poor/slow service and the pool bar service was lacking. Now the positives - after mentioning the poor service in the Italian we re-visited later in the week and got exceptional service. I also had an issue with my safe which was dealt with promptly and the staff in the main bar and restaurant were very friendly.  The amenities were good in the hotel with a nice large outdoor pool and 2 themed restaurants. a gym and spa and nice gardens. The rooms were huge and I found the beds very comfortable. The entertainment was limited to a duo and although we thoroughly enjoyed their act and joined in with them - it was the only choice every night. The golf courses were as expected Al Maaden Palace were in reasonable condition with Samanah being the standout course by miles.  unfortunately for me the biggest disappointment was the drink. I am not a big drinker by any means but I was hoping a hotel describing its concept as 'Premium Signature' would include some branded spirits in its offering. I only occasionally drink Bacardi and the white rum was a poor substitute as was the whisky gin vodka etc. The wine on the AI was limited to one red one white and one Rose with no sparkling wine.    Having been to All Inclusive resorts in Turkey for several years where the choice is fantastic its likely we will be returning there next year.

Kenzi Menara Palace,PortsdownRover wrote a review May 2015,50,Beyond expectation,Despite the failures of the Thomson rep's arrangements this hotel exceeded all expectation. Our all inclusive deal which started in an unexpected 42 degree heatwave was characterised by the exceptional professionalism of the staff from the Gardeners through to the General Manager. The food was exceptional with a wide range of choices including the option of having fresh meat and fish cooked to your particular requirements in front of you. The pool round which the hotel was built was the cleanest and largest I have seen anywhere in extensive world travel and the clever design effectively segregated small children from adults. The hotel is constantly cleaned and our room was spotless. Lunches can be had at the poolside bar and the pool staff keep customers provided with sunbed mattresses and sunshades. There are more than adequate shaded areas by the pool for the demand even at busy weekends. The really telling thing about this hotel is the way that the better off locals use it at weekends with their families and integrate with the overseas visitors. It is the perfect retreat from the busy Medina and Souks.,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hayling Island, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PortsdownRover
Kenzi Menara Palace,Marco V wrote a review May 2015,50,The most beautiful hotel in marrakech,I would like to start by thanking sharif the head concierge for being so helpful and kind while we were staying in this most amazing hotel in marrakech .  Few other staff has to be mentioned as well such as Abdula & Jalil for being so professional and at the same time made our stay memorable and enjoyable in particular Hassan the hotel entertainer and above all to us the main man!  The hotel itself its magnificent  super clean luxurious  inviting with plenty activities and services.  The highlight thus is nevertheless the food!absolutely exquisite in fact we preferred to eat in rather than going into town because was truly amazing!  We made friends there and that is a plus! I would definitely recommend it to anyone who would like to have a great relaxed and yet hassle free experience in Marrakech !

Kenzi Menara Palace,suvi786 wrote a review May 2015,40,Amazing Hotel,Arrived here with my wife during the first week of May and we stayed for 9 nights. The hotel was beautifulone of the best I have been to. We were greeted by the warm friendly staff with some refreshing mint tea. Our room was fantastic and spacious. There is a free shuttle bus to Jema El Fna square and free WiFi throughout the hotel. The garden with its flowers is beautiful and gives off a lovely scent at night. The cleaners were good although there were a couple of occasions where they walked in while we were asleep and we hadn't put the 'please clean our room sign' outside the door which was a bit awkward but overall they were good and I noticed they even folded our clothes!  I felt there could have been more choice at breakfast time. The only foods I seemed to be eating every single day were an omelette potato wedges mushrooms and haricot beans. The rest of the foods included pork so I think more variety and halal foods would have been nice. Lunch and dinner were great there was more variety. The italian restaurant was fantastic and one of the waitresses I think her name was Wafaa was great. She was really helpful and jolly and was always asking if we needed anything It was initially a bit of a struggle to speak with some of the waiters in English. Most of the time I was waiting around for coffee to be served during breakfast. One time I asked for sugar and one of the waiters brought back cocoa powder.  The room itself had tea coffee sugar and a kettle was provided later......... but no milk. When I called reception I was told there was a charge of 40 dhirams for milk. I have never had to pay for milk in any hotel and so chose to go without it.  I noticed a sheesha in the bar. I asked at the bar if they do sheesha and one of the staff said they do for 150 dhirams. One of the other staff present said something in Arabic and then he said we don't do it any more. Another conversation in Arabic took place and a third member of staff said they do sheesha only on the weekends. So when I asked what time on Saturday he said rather hesitatingly that they only offer sheesha on Sundays. I found their whole manner rather bizarre and it turned out there was no sheesha on Sunday. Just as well I went out to a sheesha lounge. There were a few ups and downs but overall I was happy and the vast majority of the staff were friendly. I feel there could be some improvements like including an iron in the room and not charging for milk.  Loved the pool bar and swimming pool. Just wished the pool bar stayed open till late! The spas were good.  The reception staff were great. Very cheerful and helpful. Sharif was on the concierge desk. He arranged our atlas mountains and fantasia tours which were fantastic and I would recommend them. He was easy to talk to and really looked after us. I remember he went out of his way to  serve us mint tea and baklava while we waited for our pickup to the airport so a big thank you to Sharif.  Also there is a nice dessert parlour across the street from the hotel called Bianco ice.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Julie H wrote a review May 2015,50,A really pleasant week. Hope the comments below are helpful,Just returned from a lovely week despite a disastarous start. Arrived at 11.45 at night and after a twenty minute check in myself and my husband were advised that there was not a room available for us. Not helpful. We were relocated to a sister hotel up the road for the night which was not pleasant I have to say  Anyway all rectified the next day when we were allocated room 217 overlooking the pool. Room was outstanding immaculate and spotless cleaned and beds etc changed every day.  The hotel did attempt to compensate with free massage room extended on last day until check out which given we had a night flight was appreciated  The comments below I hope help improve what was a great week. Italian restaurant was spectacular well done to the chefs. Moroccan restaurant was very dissapointing. Think the menu needs to have more choice. Main restaurant we found a bit hit and miss Maitre de could smile a little more!  Pool area brilliant pool bar really good despite previous comments excellent WIFI but not sure why that would be necessary when on holidays  Group in the evening were very enjoyable shuttle bus to main square was really helpful  On the whole a great week and despite the start If you want a place to completely relax and chill then this is it  Well done all and would not hesitate to return If I visit Marrakech in the future  JULIE and BRIAN,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliehS8596FA

Free shuttle bus into Marrakech which is great along with a couple of small shops restaraunts spa and a bar which are all excellent. The rooms are very big and the cleaners go as far as even folding your clothes! The pool areas are also well managed and the hotel seems quiet as it is so big.

Kenzi Menara Palace,harry1249 wrote a review May 2015,30,unbelievable,"I was in this hotel just last week and I must say that I am astonished on the ratings given by other travellers.  The staff is not up to the standards of a 5 star hotel everything you ask for is something unconcievable for them (every time I got an espresso at breakfast I had to ask for a spoon to a very surprised waiter and I was there 5 days!). The room was again not up to standards (flush leaked shower could not be fixed at any level except the lowest lights were flashing some friends had to sleep with their windows open since air conditioners sounded like an old tractor). At the bar (where no food was available not even a snack) I asked the waiter for the room service menu which after a ten minute desperate search was not found. Only time before at the bar I ordered a glass of champagne for my wife whilst some other person was screaming at the counter and arguing over the phone in a very loud voice. Had my drinks and left in a hurry to move to a more quiet place. The cost of 1 flute of champagne was the equivalent of 24 euro.... received a few explanations later:  - the ""gentleman"" yelling at the bar was one of the owners  - the cost of my drink was justified by the fact that this was a 5 star hotel after all although a second attempt was that ""once the bottle is opened in view of the fact that there are not many requests the rest of the champagne is thrown away"" so I was practically charged the bottle....had they told me I would have happily taken it with me.    The wifi connection (two choices available: room or Conference) was terrible and you had to switch between the 2 to continue working - discovered on the last evening that if you crossed the road there is a very nice ice cream shop with polite staff and from there the connection with the Menara wi-fi is perfect!!",Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Prato, Italy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/harry1249
Kenzi Menara Palace,andrew r wrote a review May 2015,50,An amazing and beautiful hotel,Wow! what can I say about this delightful hotel?  The moment you enter you are greeted warmly and with delicious mint tea.  The staff are charming and they are always happy to help with any queries.  In particular there is a member of staff called Sharif who is happy to help arrange any day trips like he did for my family when we wished to visit the beautiful Atlas mountains.    The breakfast is amazing and the seated area is well looked after by very attentive staff. The lobby is made from gorgeous marble and leads out towards the pool area which has a 50m pool 20m pool and a shallow pool for the children. There is a poolside restaurant which serves very good food and the lounging area around the pool is very relaxing.    There is a gym which has free weights machines and a fitness room with mirrors so there is no excuse not to exercise! In addition the hotel is a 5 minute walk from a lovely shopping complex which my wife and I found very relaxing and nice to while away some of the time in the evening.    The hotel lays on a shuttle bus to the market square in Marrakech which is a big bonus and takes no longer than 15 minutes.    We will definitely return and I still miss the hotel almost a month later.  I highly recommend this hotel if you want to make the most of visiting Marrakech for all the above reasons.,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/457andrewr
Kenzi Menara Palace,sreynolds2015 wrote a review May 2015,50,Brilliant hotel for marrekech holiday,I have just returned from my Holiday in Marrakech and I miss it so much.  The hotel was prefect for my holiday; I went with my husband and 3 years old.  Firstly there is a magnificent outdoors large pool and smaller warmer pool. We spent nearly every day swimming and relaxing by the poolside. The hotel is very big so there is lots of space to relax and enjoy the tranquil surroundings. It’s a fantastically clean well maintained 4+/5 star hotel.    There was a scheduled free shuttle bus which took you into the square each day which was wonderful for us. The people working at the hotel were extremely friendly and helpful and Cherif organised a trip to the Atlas Mountains for us too...thank you!!  The breakfast was vast and delicious. I would hugely recommend a holiday to Morocco. A stay at this hotel combines relaxation with the busy sites in Marrakech perfectly.

Kenzi Menara Palace,calipepper wrote a review May 2015,40,Spacious room nice hotel,Great large room and bathroom quiet and cool. We were on the ground floor not too close to the pool. All the staff impressively spoke multiple languages so communicating was never an issue. They were quite helpful. We did the all inclusive so we ate meals just at the hotel. The moroccan restaurant had live traditional music. I only wish they had a couple more main dish choices. The Italian resturant was pretty good as was the buffet restaurant. The buffet had lots of choices. The Oriental Cafe was fun to go in the evening and have a drink. They had live singer who was enjoyable. Great pool area with a smaller pool off to the side which tended to be quieter than the large pool. Everyone really seemed to be enjoying themselves at this hotel. There is no Wifi in the rooms but we were close enough to the restaurant's wifi that we could get it. However it was slow. There is a mall close by with many kinds of shops and a movie theater if you get bad weather or just need a break from the sun.,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"San Mateo, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/calipepper
Kenzi Menara Palace,Henrik Ottosen wrote a review May 2015,30,Disapointing service and room,Stayed 5 nights during business rotation. I was not impressed at all. Got a handicap room with flooded bathroom. Every time I took a shower the whole bathroom and toilet was filled with water. I asked for another room several times but was rejected. Also i asked several days for a kettle to be brought to the room as instant coffee was provided at the room but no way to make it without a kettle. After 3 days I just gave up. 2 nights coming late back to the hotel the room wasn't cleaned and when I asked in the reception why the answer was that I had put the sign not to clean the room though the sign was to clean the room when I returned late. All in all the service in the hotel is crap. I did though have one very good experience with the chef and room service. On the menu it was not possible to get a Tarjine Kefta but after asking the chef he made it for me and a very good one. That was a nice gesture and I appreciated it a lot.  2 stars maximum for the lack of service but another star to the chef for his great effort.,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Alora, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrandPaOnTheTour

It was around 15 minute drive from the main square and the hotel provided free shuttle services every 2 hours to and from the square. In terms of location walkable distance to many nightclubs and bars including 5 minute walk to pacha. If you prefer to be out of the main medina this is a great choice.

We had a pool view room in the Gardenias block and were pleased with the room facilities and space. The majority of staff were very friendly and helpful with special mention to René Baiada the General Manager for his rapid action to resolve a problem we had Mohammed the Food and Catering Manager for making our Anniversary dinner so special Cherif the Concierge for answering all our questions and helping us during our stay and to Ali in the Moroccan restaurant for his friendly service. Also a mention to Mustafa in the main restaurant for his attentive service in the evening and not forgetting the cashier who was efficient and had a very good ""English"" sense of humour.  The pool bar staff need to be trained to be more proactive and to work harder to frequently make themselves available around the pool to provide drinks and to tidy up ""empties"" more efficiently. They were the weak link in the overall service chain. Also the wifi internet access was not always available. Room for improvement!  Although the large pool was chilly the area was delightful with plenty of space on most days and very little problem with finding a lounger unless you wanted a specific location!  We found the food choice wide ranging and very tasty. We love salads tagines and desserts! A plate warmer and better toasters would be welcome though.  The local medina in Marrakech old city was easily accessible with the free shuttle bus.

Kenzi Menara Palace,bessieb13 wrote a review Apr 2015,40,Good option for a relaxed week,Have just returned from a week at the Kenzi Menara Palace. Overall we had a really good experience and would happily stay again. Really spacious family suite with everything you would expect in it. Spotlessly clean. Very quiet (even though we were above Reception). Lovely big pool with plenty of loungers. Pool isn't heated which was a shame Pool staff were excellent at keeping the area clean and ensuring additional loungers were brought out if necessary. Also provided useful table tennis tournament participants for our kids! There are three restaurants and we tried all three - food is generally very good and unless you are extremely fussy you will find plenty to like. The concierge was very helpful in organising trips and excursions - the Guides he organised for us were knowledgeable and good safe drivers which we appreciated.  A few little niggles with the hotel - the key card system is not very reliable. Keys stop working after you have used them once or twice. We were close to reception so not too much of a pain but could be mighty irritating if you had to keep walking a long way to get them reprogrammed. Not quite enough staff in the restaurants at breakfast and dinner - sometimes hard to get their attention for drinks orders. Otherwise pretty good. In summary:  Biggest positives of the hotel: Size of family suite (two rooms with loads of space) friendly staff overall all inclusive package very convenient and cost effective big pool area with lots of beds easy to organise trips with Concierge.

Kenzi Menara Palace,MartinWhereIsTheSun wrote a review Apr 2015,50,Not quite a 5* but…..,We have just returned from 7 nights AI and were not disappointed (except for the unusually poor weather at the beginning of our holiday). I have no complaints at all about the hotel but would not rate it as 5* - definitely a good 4* though.  The staff in the main were very good and especially the concierge Cherif who was so helpful and willing. He sorted out trips to the Atlas Mountains - although the day we went our trip was cut short due to landslides blocking the roads and a guided tour to the Souk and Jemaa el Fna square – the prices he charges are well below those that the tour operators would charge. He also collected and returned my in-laws from/to another Marrakech hotel to our hotel for drinks/food. A good man!! Lamia looked after us well in the pool bar everyday – service with a smile – thank you!!  The rooms are spacious and very clean although I thought our bathroom was a bit tired looking. There are plenty of beds around the pool and available at all times of the day and it was nice not to see towels being laid on beds at the crack of dawn.  Food in the main restaurant is more than acceptable and varied. We also ate in both a la carte restaurants and found the Italian to be particularly good with a varied menu and excellent service. The Moroccan attracts a €10 surcharge I can only assume to cover the traditional music that is played throughout the evening. The menu there was quite limited and the portions quite small although what was served was very nice and again great service.  For those golfers out there – the courses we played (Samanah Amelkis Palmeraie and Royal – in order of preference) were all in good condition and within 20 mins of the hotel. We had caddies on two of them who spoke limited English but good French/Arabic – nice blokes and very knowledgeable particularly on the greens. All courses were reasonably quiet and as a 3 ball we managed to get round in 3½ hrs or less – not bad for holiday golf.  Would I return? Yes without doubt but I think I'd like to try a Riad nearer to Marrakech itself first.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MartinWhereIsTheSun

The Menara Palace is an excellent hotel and if you are lucky you can see the snow capped atlas mountains in the distance at this time of year. We experienced very good service especially from the Concierge who was extremely helpful. My wife needed some medical attention and this was delt with immediately. As per other reviews there is smoking in communal areas but this is part of life in Morocco The food was very good with plenty of choice and beautiful desserts. The rooms are really big and well laid out.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Albie_Greywhite wrote a review Mar 2015,40,Lovely Hotel would Recommend,We just returned from a 6 night stay hoping for some spring time sunshine unfortunately we seemed to pick a rubbish week as it was chilly with sunshine either side off stay! Hotel was lovely though and we would definitely come again. Our room was massive more like a suite with separate lounge area which was great as we were on holiday with our two year old son so were able to put his cot in the lounge area which kept it nice and quiet whilst we sat in the large bedroom with separate terrace.  The food was great with lovely tagines and a real variety served and the staff very helpful. Pastry chef amazing! Pool bar is good and serves nice snack food burgers and pizza etc. this is included in the all inclusive option.  There is a mini bar fridge in the room but no milk is supplied for tea and coffee making which was a shame. The fridge was also not restocked every day we had to ask for more juice etc. the cleaners were great though and left the room immaculate and smelling lovely! The hotel is very clean.  We were all inclusive but the evening meal in the restaurant was not available until 1930 which was too late for us with a little one. One night we asked if we could take plates of food to our room as my son was asleep. They said it was fine but when I tried to leave with the food there was a massive fuss saying I had taken too much! ( I only had two plates with some rice and tagine on not particularly large portions!) after this embarrassment my husband and I decided to eat in separate sittings for the evening meal as our son was always asleep and we prefer to baby sit ourselves.  The outside pool was very cold but this probably warms up in the summer months or is a nice cooling dip from the heat. The smaller pool was abit warmer and we did brave this! There is an indoor pool but this is part of the spa and you have to pay extra ( about 10 GBP per person a day).  I would recommend a horse and cart ride around Marrakesh. This takes about two hours and the concierge can arrange for it to come to the hotel and drop you off at the door again. We also got him to arrange a taxi to the tomb palace and camel ride. The tombs and palace are nothing to write home about unless you are into mosaics! A bit of a building site in a graveyard!  Be careful not to get ripped off at the camel ride they asked us for 500DH initially and we paid 70DH for about 10 minute walk which the taxi driver said wad reasonable.  We used the children's park in the hotel grounds a lot but we're disappointed that the gate did not lock ( our son is a fast runner!) and also some of the equipment needed repairing and there was not a lot in there.  Whenever we asked for anything the staff were very prompt e.g. Porter maintenance etc. a lovely stay and would recommend this hotel.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Albie_Greywhite
Kenzi Menara Palace,sun_worshipper00 wrote a review Mar 2015,40,Mainly all Good,Just spent a week at this hotel. The rooms are really lovely. A lot of people on here have said to request a pool view room but we had a garden view which also looked over the road which we enjoyed as it was great to people watch. Not noisy at all.  The only issue we had was that sometimes the food on the buffet could have been hotter.  Went to theItalian a la carte which we thought was excellent. Tried to book Moroccan but due to error made by reception we did not get a table. Management were very apologetic and as it was my husband's birthday arranged for a gorgeous birthday cake complete with singing waitress and waiters. Pool is lovely and sunbeds very comfortable ( important to us). Glad to say Marrakesh had sorted out their immigration queue on arrival. Last year spent2 hours in the queue.

We were a small group of 'mature' golfers who were immediately impressed with the welcome and efficiency of the team at the hotel. This level of service and genuine interest was sustained throughout our stay. The choice and standard of food was very good with 3 restaurants providing variety and a local flavour. The rooms were spacious and well equipped. We had a pool view which is preferable to the view to the road. WiFi is available and free with good reception in the public areas.

Kenzi Menara Palace,johnpetersfield wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Perfect for a Golf trip,I was very impressed with this hotel which for food and facilities was far better that the Kenzi Club we stayed at last year. The rooms are very spacious for 2 people with all the facilities you would expect from a 5* category. The food both buffet and in the Italian restaurant was very good the desserts were to die for !! We played golf in the morning and returned to relax by the pool at about 3.00pm. there were plenty of beds free and towels available. Everything of course was helped by the glorious sunny weather we had on our 4 days here but the hotel is geared up for most eventualities. In good weather they have a BBQ in the evening at the pool bar and a wonderful experience it is too - lamb and chicken particularly good.  Overall we were overwhelmed by the helpfulness and friendliness of the staff where from check in to check out they never failed to have a smile on their faces and went out of their way to ensure we had everything we needed.  We will definitely return next year.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Jose G wrote a review Mar 2015,30,Lovely buildings alone is not enough,This is a lovely hotel set just outside Marrakech. It is billed as 5 star luxury. The hotel building/complex is certainly excellent with fine common areas numerous restaurants  interior and exterior bars a magnificent outdoor swimming pool ( as well as an interior pool though a charge applies for this) and generous rooms with equally generous bathrooms. As far as accommodation is concerned one would have to be finicky to have any grouse.  The staff were predominantly welcoming charming helpful and gracious. Though inevitably  this was spoilt by others with a sourly and indifferent disposition.  Where all this loveliness and oasis of relaxation unfold is in its restaurants. There’s a great deal of charcoal barbeques in the open air on a lovely terrace with a wide choice of meats vegetables fish etc available . But alas it seemed it was all about quantity rather than quality. So after a couple of meals it’s all same-ish and indifferent. The main three restaurants attempt some degree of choice. The main one is buffet style and is supposedly ‘ International Cuisine ‘ but anything other than Moroccan food is amateurish done and displayed. The main forte here are the deserts of yoghurt fresh fruits and local pastries. Certainly this is not a 5 star  nor even 4 star restaurant . It rather lets the hotel down.  The second main restaurant is Moroccan. It looked well decorated in the rich decorative local style and had local musicians gently playing in the entrance. I can’t offer any comment as I did not use this restaurant. But I can tell you all about the third much hyped restaurant  the so-called Italian restaurant. My colleague  in a previous visit had not used it as the menu did not offer any pasta or pizza. Well on my suggestion my whole party of 13 agreed to dine in the Italian. A booking was required so we booked for 8pm. We all trooped in on time and waited for service. It was a lovely room with large iconic photos of Italian film stars of the 1950s and 1960s( Sophia Loren & the like) There were only 4 others in the restaurant. And we waited for service. Gentle gestures to the waiters were ignored. And we waited for service. It took all of 30 minutes for a waiter to decide to take our order for drinks. Nothing too taxing red wine white wine rose wine and water. This eventually appeared. After more waiting our food order was taken. There were 3 choices of starters and 4 of main courses. Rather than come round to each of us  the waiter stood at the end of the table requesting we put up our hands for soup etc. Degrading and ridiculous. Quite a few of us ordered minestrone followed by scaloppine Milanese. We eventually got our minestrone an hour after we sat down. It turned out to be hot water swimming with oil and a few slivers of vegetable. More akin to washing up water than any soup I’ve ever encountered. Inedible  left untouched. More waiting for the second course. It was now some 2 hours since we first sat down. The scaloppine was overcooked cold  hard and could have done several army treks as boot soles. Inedible left untouched. It was served with cold spaghetti without sauce of any sort.  The only conclusion I arrive at is that this restaurant is a mockery of the term. It should close until they get Italians or Italian trained staff. It drags the hotel right down to such a degree that it can’t possibly claim 5 stars. It’s such a shame. Lovely buildings alone is not enough it needs some decent restaurants.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/424joseg

The hotel is large but pretty and when we stayed in march pretty quiet. It's a mistake to ask for a garden room. These are road not garden view. For any inward view ask for pool view. We were moved as we were pretty unhappy with our road view but this was done without too much fuss. The rooms are enormous the sun beds plenty and comfy the staff cheerful and helpful and drinks in the all inclusive package good! We were surprised to sign for drinks but don't be worried if they are all inclusive they don't end up on your bill. We loved the outside lunch but the dining hall when covered is a bit cavernous and lacking atmosphere in the evening.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Ealingfolk wrote a review Mar 2015,40,Really enjoyed our stay,We have just returned from a 6 night break at this hotel which we enjoyed very much. Plus points - the rooms are large and very clean the food is varied and the staff are absolutely delightful doing their very best to help in every situation. Sharif was particularly helpful and charming to us. Mention has been made that the swimming pools were freezing cold. We would like to correct this as we were nearly put off coming to this hotel because of the comments. The large pool is too cold but the smaller one is exactly the right temperature - an initial cool surprise and then perfect to relax in and enjoy.  Food - breakfast - tasty and plenty of choice (toasters very slow). Dinner - our first night was the Moroccan buffet and the choice and standard of food was fantastic. Unfortunately nothing else quite matched up to this on following nights - although we didn't try the Moroccan restaurant only the buffet. Comments have been made about cold food - again a correction - the food is very tasty and not cold in the serving tagines but the plates are stone cold and by the time you have chosen your food it was getting cold - we did mention this at the time so maybe something can be done.  We had an initial problem with room allocation and then were given a room which received no sunlight and was therefore quite cold. They did re-boot the heating for our second day which was better.  Rooms are provided with a kettle and a little tea/coffee but no milk so we collected some at breakfast to keep in the fridge. Plastic teaspoons in the rooms is a bit disappointing.  However we were still keen to be in a brighter room and were absolutely delighted to be given an upgrade to a Suite and the rest of our stay was great.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Ayoub wrote a review Mar 2015,30,"Nice Facilities and Room, but lacking good food & Iron board!!!","I was skeptical when we booked this hotel. Somehow I thought the hotel was little ""old"" from looking at the picture. But when I arrived there the hotel actually look nice! it's got nice and specious rooms pool facilities and most importantly great atlas mountain views. I've attached to this review some room pictures.. more pictures will come up on my Flickr account .. My colleagues have actually tried the spa massage service and said it was very good too I didn't get a chance to do so unfortunately.    My complains about the hotel were the food and food quality. Morocco is famous for its great tasting food unfortunately the hotel buffet was a disappointment.    Hotel location was a bit distant from the main city and it was a drive to go anywhere..    Also it became a norm in these modern hotels that the rooms would be equipped with an Iron & Iron board... and usually when there's non available the hotel would make it available on request .. but not this one. The hotel actually would ask you to send your items for laundry to charge you for it. Okay I do understand that the hotel may want to make a little more $$ but the biggest disappointment was that my shirt came back in a similar condition that it was sent but with a cover on it. I called the reception to complain and they promised to have the laundry call me back - but they never did. Upon check out they insisted that they charge me for the lousy laundry job they've done!    If you ask me whether I'll stay here again or not I'd say probably not - just for the fact that I'd like to try some other hotel probably with a better location & food.

We were not so enamoured with our blue wristbands surely a quality hotel can think of a better way to mark out their All Inclusive Guests.  Our garden view room was large and clean with a terrace and HUGE bed we were very pleased with the accommodation it was warm during the chilly nights.  The food in the buffet was good with a fine array of choice for all three meals service was attentive.  We used the pool area the bar food and service all good. The pools look fabulously inviting and as a keen swimmer I was encouraged to take a dip - I chose the small pool near the bar - it was like swimming in the Baltic! During our stay I was the only one brave enough to take the plunge did one length did not repeat the experience. As an indoor pool is listed under hotel facilities we were disappointed to discover it required a separate payment (around £10) - the pools were a big factor when choosing the hotel so a bit downhearted.  The concierge organised a driver and car to take us to Essaouira on our last day this was excellent and we were delivered to the airport for our flight home.  I had a hammam and massage at the spa - superb!  We did have to change rooms due to noisy neighbours who chose to party through the night - I phoned reception at midnight and 1am eventually the noise ceased though due to interconnecting doors we suffered the smell of cigarrette smoke (smoking is access all areas in Morrocco). Having to put up wth the inconvienience of moving it would have been a nice gesture to be offered an upgraded room for our last night - this was not the case though we were happy enough with the alternative.

Also it was really quiet 40 guests max so loads of room around the pool. 75 degrees every day 10 mins from airport and soukhs. recommend room 355 furthest away from restaurants but late sun and v quiet.

Kenzi Menara Palace,GILLACK wrote a review Jan 2015,50,Quality calm,After 3 nights in a riad in the central of Marrakesh it was lovely to walk into the hotel . We were greeted with welcoming smiles and tea . The rooms were spacious and clean . The facilities were exactly as I expected from the website  half the hotel was blocked off for Paris Football team but that did not impact on our stay . The staff were very helpful and a special thanks to the bedroom staff for all the water  the desk manager for letting us check out late and the concierge for all his help with taxis and advice . We enjoyed the swimming pools  restaurants  bar and gym . The prices in the hotel were very reasonable and the food good . Would recommend it to all and thanks for a very special holiday .,Date of stay: December 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Colne, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GILLACK
Kenzi Menara Palace,Nellyk69 wrote a review Jan 2015,40,Beautiful hotel - enjoyable stay!,Hotel is stunning very clean amazing grounds and great location!    Cherif the concierge was really helpful and we booked a number of trips through him - however we found out by accident that he was able to do this for us it wasn't mentioned when we checked in in fact the concierge service wasn't mentioned at all.    Overall we found the staff friendly and helpful - although as other reviewers have mentioned - once you have a drink they don't tend to come back to see if you would like another you have to get their attention. Front desk staff don't ever crack a smile and seem to fob you off if they don't know the answer to your question and really don't like imparting any information which they think you might need and can be quite dismissive of you.    However these are the only negatives of our stay and are relatively small things.    Food was good (we don't normally do all inclusive but were pleasantly surprised!) and they tried hard to make the menu different everyday. However it does get a little boring and we ate out a few nights which is very cheap and would highly recommend sampling the street food in the medina on a night!    Pool area was exceptional lots of very comfy sun loungers and complimentary towels. Staff round the pool were great and couldn't do enough for you.    Room was huge! We stayed over new year and they brought macaroons flowers and candles on NYE which was a nice touch. Clean towels and rooms cleaned everyday.    Overall a great stay in a beautiful hotel - would highly recommend!,Date of stay: December 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Middlesbrough, UK",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nellyk69

Well the hotel was very relaxed  although it can be annoying with the amount of rude people attending conferences in this hotel  also our patio door on our suite did not lock closed yet the staff didn't seem to understand  but overall the hotel was nice  the Italian Resturant had a lovely feel to it.  the bars needed to stay open later as 11.30 was too early to close when your on holiday  other guests felt the same  the singer in the bar was lovely  would be lovely if one of the pools was adults only as the children could be annoying(ours are older now so stay at home ) .we actually made some lovely friends within this hotel so definitely a worth while place to go & yes I would recommend it although I don't think I would stay here again .we went in September but all the activities & entertainment had finished  set for winter  I felt this was a bit early as hotel was still busy .,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,hampshire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TOCHampshire
Kenzi Menara Palace,saf_2m wrote a review Dec 2014,40,"Really great hotel, however please BAN smoking from restaurant and rooms....","We stayed for 7 nights as part of an extended family holiday. We were two families traveling together (two brothers + wives + a whole bunch of kids).    We had initially booked rooms at the Kenzi Farah because of their walking distance to the main square however in the weeks leading up to our departure that hotel kept getting so many bad reviews that we decided to change our reservations and moved to the Kenzi Menara.    We are SO glad that we did. Beautiful hotel with lovely gardens fresh air and amazing mountain views. We were of course welcomed warmly by Mr. Cherif. We had booked two interconnecting rooms for my brother-in-law and his family and one family suite for ourselves.    Upon arrival my own family was allocated a significantly smaller room than the 110 sqm suite that we had booked (and had it on paper). It was a little bit annoying since when traveling with kids you just want to settle in your room and rest after a long flight. But the mistake was rectified within an hour and we then found ourselves in a lovely spacious suite for the rest of the week.    Regarding the staff I just cannot understand the bad reviews. They were all so smiling and went totally out of the way for us. The lovely cleaning ladies and the helpful young guys serving at breakfast. Special thanks to Abdsammad (I think his name was) who took great care of both our families the whole week.  Usually we are very picky about were to sit at breakfast because of the kids and the first day he saw us pondering and just said ""Please sit wherever you like. This is your home""...After that every morning ""our"" table was ready before we came down for breakfast even with the baby chair made ready. That was indeed amazing and very much appreciated.    Breakfast traditional Moroccan and lovely. Best harissa ever to go with the sausages and eggs. Best coffee I have had for a long time. Every morning freshly squeezed orange juice. Ladies making filling pancakes and omelets.    Plenty of free parking just in front of the hotel entrance. We had rented cars so it wasn't a problem to stay outside the noisy city center. We took a couple of day trips to Essaouria Atlas mountains and even one day to Casablanca to see the famous Hassan II mosque.    There are two negatives from us though that should be considered by management and are the reason why I'm not giving this a top rating.    1) One minor was the serving of pork at breakfast. It was very off putting (we avoided the alcohol by not eating at the hotel in the evenings). The hotel probably does it because they want to cater for all sorts of guests. Well we have never seen any hotel in Europe putting out a special halal section at their buffet for us.  We have travelled a lot through out the Gulf countries Malaysia Turkey etc and stayed at several large international 5 star hotel chains and never seen pork at a breakfast buffet.  We live in the West ourselves and have a lot of non-Muslim friends so rest assure that they can live without pork for a few days with a more than a full buffet at hand when visiting a Muslim country and that you can make wonderful bacon out of turkey meat as well.    2) One really major negative is the hotel's totally hopeless smoking policy. We were absolutely shocked to see how people were smoking us right up in the faces at breakfast. Our poor kids had their amount of passive smoking in a week more than they would experience through out a whole year in Denmark.  The hotel's ""idea"" of separating the smokers from the non-smokers in a not that large breakfast room is just to put the two different groups in each end of the room. It is semi open so if the wind is blowing in a certain direction all the smoke landed right on our tables. It was rather outrageous to see that in these days and ages (2014 and soon to be 2015) with all the firsthand widely available knowledge about smoking you still see these very old school attitudes towards smoking. Like back in the days where the smokers sat in the back of the plane on passenger flights.  If the hotel really wants to keep up ""Western standards"" in the restaurant then banning smoking should be the first one since that is luckily illegal through out Western Europe and North America in restaurants and has been now for many years.    Also the vent system needs to be checked because smoke travels from smoking rooms to non-smoking rooms through the bathrooms. In both our toilets in the suite through out the whole week there was a nasty strong smell of tobacco.    Other than that everything was fine as mentioned before and once again with a very welcoming staff.",Date of stay: December 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Copenhagen, Denmark",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saf_2m
Kenzi Menara Palace,Freddi G wrote a review Dec 2014,40,"Lovely in some ways, annoying in others",Had a really good xmas break here with my family. The room was amazingly large with a very large comfortable bed. The staff around the hotel were generally pleasant and genuinely helpful.    There were a few things that got to us - the (heated) indoor pool is not accessible to children after 1100 (as it is in the spa area) - the outdoor pools too cold to use this time of the year; one of the restaurants that was supposed to be part of the all-inclusive deal had a surcharge; we booked a number of treatments at the spa - all of them uninspiring.    The concierge - Cherif - is very helpful and gave us a quick and useful orientation for what we could do during our days in Marrakesh.    Useful tips:  - For getting around Marrakech use the town taxis. You need to haggle them down but 50 dirhams will get you to the main square and a 100 to the airport. If haggling is not your thing the concierge can book cars for you.  - There is a Carrfour super market just behind the hotel - around a five minute walk. One can buy everything there from spices sweets to mint-tea kettles & clay tajines at non-tourist prices. Of course it doesn't quite have the same atmosphere as the souk.,Date of stay: December 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fgyara

Kenzi Menara Palace,EddieO945 wrote a review Dec 2014,50,Beautiful hotel! Great service!,The Kenzi Menara Palace was our home for six days and we found a luxurious hotel beautifully manicured grounds and an impeccably clean room overlooking the gardens and pool. What made our stay exceptional was Cherif the gracious chief concierge who is dedicated to being of service to guests. Without Cherif my wife stlll might be sick (he immediately secured an emergency doctor for her) and we would have enjoyed our time in Morocco much less. He arranged for reliable drivers and informative guides to get us where we needed to go (we were attending a conference) and the last night we walked over to the Crystal Restaurant which he recommended and which is designed like a dream and had a terrific chef.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Siane1984 wrote a review Nov 2014,30,Mixed feelings....,The hotel itself is beautiful the all inclusive facilities are second to none the food is above average and the grounds and pool area's are simply stunning! The reason that I WILL NOT be booking this hotel again is nothing to do with the facilities or the hotel itself - but some staff members who were less than helpful and on occasion down right rude!    From our booking being dealt with incorrectly as soon as we arrived ( not enough rooms reserved then giving us the key to the wrong room and then constantly forgetting to add the extra bed that we had paid for) to trying to charge us twice for part of our stay and for drinks we had already paid for and could provide receipts for on check out...... the staff involved in these incidents were rude and at times aggressive with one 'gentleman' on reception asking me 'What do you want me to do about it?' when I informed him that he had given us the wrong room for the 2nd time!!    We were also told by the man at the Moroccan themed restaurant that he 'Forgot' to book our table when we turned up for our meal on night...... this in itself wasn't the main problem here but the fact that we had also arranged for a cake to be brought out for our friend who'd birthday it was. We were given a table eventually and a cake brought out but it was obviously a cake that was found last minute ( probably from the buffet cart) - either way thou it was a nice surprise for the birthday boy and he seemed to enjoy it!    On a positive note the free shuttle to the souk is definitely worth using and the rooms were absolutely stunning real luxury!    We were looking forward to rebooking for next year but with one incident after another ( and trust me this review is the shortened version of events) I really don't think that it is worth the hassle for a few days of luxury!,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Newport, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Siane1984
Kenzi Menara Palace,Tony P wrote a review Nov 2014,30,Pleasant hotel away from the busy centre,Lovely staff and concierge Cherif who especially made us feel very welcome.  Very quiet and peaceful hotel.  Generous sized deluxe bedroom and comfy bed on ground floor overlooking the pool.  Lovely spa though not offered any water before or after.  However alcoholic drinks were very expensive more than double the price of UK.  There was a good choice at breakfast though we noticed that the cooks did not use gloves when handling food at the omelette station. Could this be a reason why we both contracted a noro type virus at the end of our stay after 4 days? We had not left the hotel in that time and were used to using antibacterial spray on our hands.  Getting things done often took more than three phone calls or visits to the reception.,Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Guildford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/761tonyp

Upon arrival you are greeted and seated in the foyer which is lavish and has a beautiful aromatic smell.    The Hotel suite was GORGEOUS Large & Extremly clean ....The Bathroom suite was heaven on earth with a Bath & Walk in shower.    The Staff were 10/10 especially Sherif who is on the Concierge desk. He speaks amazing English and is so friendly and helpful. He helped us organize all our Excursions and sightseeing adventures.    The Buffet was 7/10 could have been a bit more variety but the other Restaurants were sublime within the hotel.    We went to the Atlas mountains in our own personal chauffeured Mercedes Benz (Top of the range) it was like paradise.    I would recommend this place a 1000's times as it was sublime. The spa massage sent me into a trance it was well priced but the treatment was worth so much more if im honest.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Elsie20142014 wrote a review Nov 2014,40,Peaceful Oasis,A large hotel on the outskirts of the town centre about 15 minutes drive to the square. I took advantage of the complimentary shuttle bus from the hotel which ran every few hours to the souks.    The hotel was nicely decorated clean and inviting. My room was on the ground floor overlooking the gardens and pool. I had an en suite bathroom with shower bath and his and hers sinks and separate toilet It was very clean and nicely decorated. I am very fussy and had no cause for complaint.    Breakfast was complimentary and you had a wide choice but the hot food was not to my taste so I stuck to fruit cereal and cakes hot drinks juice and croissants which was fine.    The service was very good and all the staff were friendly and very helpful. My main concern was feeling safe as I was alone and I certainly felt secure.    Other guests were mainly older and at this time of the year there were not many children around. As I was here for a rest it was fine that there did not seem to be much entertainment and a trip into the centre would surely solve that problem.    The grounds and garden were well kept and all my requests were reacted to promptly. My room was cleaned every day and sheets changed. The TV in the room was welcome as was the air conditioning and the patio where I could sit which over looked the gardens.

Kenzi Menara Palace,nickmoreton wrote a review Nov 2014,40,Just the food let it down..... But very good!!,We recently spent four nights at the Kenzi Menara Palace...  Upon arrival the welcome from the reception was very nice. However we were given a hotel information sheet in French despite the receptionist knowing we were English. Not that it bothers me but a sheet in English would have been a nice touch.    The negative......  We ate most nights in the main 'buffet' restaurant and on the last two nights struggled to find anything to our liking. Service was also a little haphazard and waiters had to be approached to get service. This was the same at breakfast. On one evening one of the fridges was not switched on and it had salad in it that looked well past its sell by date.. However on Sunday night they had Turkey kebabs that were cooked fresh apart from they had forgotten to cook one of mine.. sorry but basic stuff!  Breakfast was good but getting a coffee or a tea can be a struggle.. There did not seem enough staff on at breakfast most days. In fact the best food was available at the pool bar.. Basic hot food that is simple to serve but not really to our taste as we like to taste the local food.. There is a Italian a la carte restaurant which seemed closed for two evenings then when it was open looked too quiet... And the Moroccan restaurant looked nice but we ate out when looking for authenticity so can't comment.    The positives...  The rooms are lovely and spacious and very clean!!  The staff all seem to be friendly and welcoming  The gardens are well kept  The location is perfect!  The evening bar service was really pleasant and drinks very nice  The Royal Hammam is awesome  The swimming pool and sun loungers are great! With views of The Atlas Mountains!  Oh and a tip...

Kenzi Menara Palace,Mac1963 wrote a review Nov 2014,40,Good but could be so much better,As the title says this hotel is good very good I fact but could be so much better and I just can't understand why it falls short it really shouldn't happen. On the plus side the hotel is in a very quiet location nothing around it but that didn't really matter. Hotel grounds and surrounding area are kept in fabulous condition. Everything is spotlessly clean. Our room was a superior suite and was massive we where thrilled with it very impressive. The pool area was gorgeous with plenty of the most comfy luxurious sun beds available at any time of the day and you are not allowed to reserve thank goodness. The things I found disappointing where....... The main pool was ice cold I persevered and managed a couple of swims but everyone was complaining and disappointed even the extreme heat didn't raise the water temperature except for the kids pool. We where all inclusive but not sure if it was worth the extra the food was good but we have had far better in other hotels in recent years for the same cost or less. The service generally throughout the hotel was good with one or two really good friendly staff and they stood out a mile unfortunately the general standard of service was a bit lacking and oh my god where they forgetful! When we arrived it was late and we where just given a piece of paper giving us brief details regarding the buffet etc but near the end of our stay I heard some arrivals having everything explained including the concierge service and what is on offer this would have made such a differance to us and we could have benefitted so much more and organised more trips and got more out of our stay. Once we realised we contacted Cherif the head concierge who was fabulous and he booked a couple of guided tours we where very grateful to him and thouroughly enjoyed them. Something to note however is that even with organised government guides in the souks they seem to takes you to particular sellers which we suspect pay the guides/hotel commission if you buy it's very hard sell having said that would love to do it again as I would be ready for the 'shut you in a room with complimentary drink till you make a purchase' next time!!

Kenzi Menara Palace,Sari W wrote a review Nov 2014,40,Nice getaway for October Half term,I have just returned back to UK from almost 2 weeks of sunny holiday :)    It was a challenge to persuade my husband to go on All inclusive vacation with our two little girls. He has not done so in over 30 years :) But after while and getting used to it - even he enjoyed it !! (with some exceptions)    As soon you walk into this lovely hotel you know that you are in a different culture from the stunning decor to being greeted with a tasty mint tea.  We had a suite on the ground floor which was fabulous - Spacious spotless clean and easy short walk to the pool or lobby.    Yes some inconsistency in the staff lets this great hotel down with their grumpiness and simply ignoring you as a customer - ie pool bar (they will just stay there chatting together and you can be waiting for some time when you ask about the service - answer - not my turn now ! or some other silly excuse.. and some staff in the main restaurant (same again - chatting and you can be sitting  waiting for a drink for quite a few minutes.  So I can see why some of the previous comments mentioned this is an issue. and they were right :( I put it down to the managerial training :( my husband had a bad experience with a very rude spa manageress - just giggling and ignoring him at the spa reception to the point he had a word with her in front of the other staff there! (where he had already a few treatments..)- which prompted him to seek another spa - and hence the hotel loss on more treatments - and from then- he had massages etc done daily elsewhere due to a health issue!    BUT not all is bad  Contrary - once you get used to the different manners of being treated with the All inclusive at the bottom of the service  the kids enjoyed the pool (main was far too cold so they stayed mainly in the small warmer one) the food was very good - special compliments to the pastry chef - just outstanding ! Concierge Cherif was superb - he organised a few trips for us and Majid (the driver/guide) was an excellent ! Definitely recommend both services highly !  We particularly enjoyed the Atlas mountains and Fantasia. I would also recommend a horse carriage - kids loved it.    I also found the rest of the staff nice - the receptionist cashier handfull of friendly waiters/es (the ill mannered ones I could count on one hand) and lovely housekeeping (please tip them well - this hotel is spotless clean).

Kenzi Menara Palace,Ellis T wrote a review Nov 2014,40,Nice hotel on all inclusive basis,We stayed here in September 2014 for 7 nights on an all inclusive basis. First of all I arranged with the hotel a transfer from the airport which was 200 dirhams. The driver was waiting for us at arrivals and was fine - our rep had mentioned that a taxi would have been half the cost but I think this was worth the extra as not having to wait for a taxi and knowing where you are going.    On check-in we were welcomed with a warm mint tea and a cool towel which was a nice touch. We were told to sit down in reception and wait to be called to check in. Maybe 10 minutes went by and not being seen to I went to reception they had thought we were with another party that was checking in so did not come over to us! That being said check in was smooth and we was advised of the local taxes that we would have to pay at the end of our stay - I was already aware of this from my research before booking so this was no surprise. Reception advised that due to our waiting to be checked in they had upgraded our room free of charge. We had checked in at around 6.30pm so we went to our room unpacked and freshened up and went straight down to dinner.    The location of the hotel for me was ideal. It is out of the city centre so it is a lot quieter although it is in the flight path of the airport - do not let this put you off it is not Heathrow! Maybe a dozen flights a day that you notice. I would definitely recommend the hotel shuttle bus into Marrakech city centre if you wish to visit the Souks. I think it is every two hours and they are always in the same location - we were on the first one of the morning which I thought was ideal as it does get very busy later in the day.    We had room 301 (I think) which was almost directly above the reception area and next to the large suite. It was quite large and overlooked the pool and gardens with a view of the mountains in the background. The room did not have a stand up shower which was a bit disappointing and the bed was too hard and the bedding not as luxurious as you would expect for a supposedly 5* hotel. Overall the room was a nice size with good facilities - his and her sinks included!    The food was really good for an all inclusive hotel. Breakfast was nice and had a selection of hot and cold food as well as cooked to order pancakes and omelettes. We had lunch around the pool bar most days and this was always cooked fresh and not simply reheated. Dinner was a very good selection of both Moroccan and continental food. There was always a nice variety throughout the week. In our all inclusive package we had one night in the Moroccan restaurant and one in the Italian. The Moroccan was a very nice atmosphere with live music and good food - the food was similar to that of the main restaurant just a better quality and made to order. I had the monk fish tagine which was very nice. The Italian was what we expected smaller portions but still very nice.    The only real negative to the main buffet restaurant was the service of drinks. You are asked if you would like a drink at the start but that will be all. The waiters will not come and ask if you want another drink or not even if it clear your glass is empty but you are still eating - they will walk straight past you. If drinks were self service I could understand this but they are not. The guests which were not staying on an all inclusive package were waited on much more and looked after.    The pool was really nice albeit a bit too cold a couple of degrees higher would be ideal. That being said it was always very clean and well tended to. The cabanas and sun loungers are very nice and comfortable and provided beach towels always clean and soft. One word of advice in the pool there is a wall between the deep and shallow areas which you see a lot of people sitting on and walking along - do not sit on it as the paint seems to come off on your costume. One of my fiancés bikinis is ruined because of this.    The drinks package included were good and the cocktails were nice and quite strong - this is usually unheard of for all inclusive as I have found they are usually watered down. The beer that was included was nice and always cold. One issue we did have was that my fiancé ordered a diet coke in the bar of the hotel one evening (well before the all inclusive cut-off time) and we were charged for this on our bill on check out - it was removed by the reception staff but it should not have been there in the first place we did have our all inclusive bands on after all.    I do not mean to sound too negative just a few things for you to be aware of. Overall it is a lovely hotel in a nice location with good facilities. I would not visit again (that is just me wanting to visit new places) but I would recommend it to my friends and family. I would say it is more 4* rather than 5* compared to other 5* hotels that I have stayed at in recent years.,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Maidstone, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EllisT115
Kenzi Menara Palace,iancoles wrote a review Nov 2014,40,Great value for money,We stayed at the Kenzi Menara Palace for 4 nights in late October. Travelling with two kids aged 9 and 6 we had originally booked to stay in a Riad though discovering the weather was set to be great (28-32 each day) we switched at the last minute favouring a hotel with a decent sized swimming pool and more for the kids to do. We weren't disappointed. Whilst the hotel is large and clearly lacks the atmosphere of a Riad it makes up for this in facilities. We booked a family room which was huge with a separate sitting area in which two beds a sofa and two chairs easily fitted. The main bedroom was also huge. The hotel grounds are well kept wit two pools one of which was heated. The i heated pool was very cold but once in quite enjoyable ! We opted for the all inclusive dining option which worked very well with a good buffet selection for breakfast lunch and dinner. There are also two speciality restaurants  Moroccan and Italian at which we had a meal at no extra charge. Water was supplied in rooms and around pool free of charge. The hotel is a good 10 minute taxi ride from the Jemaa El Fna squad ( 50 dirhams) and in a quite area.    I am highly recommend the hotel – it represented excellent value for money.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"West Malling, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iancoles

Great location - a short taxi ride into the city. We always looked forward to returning to the peaceful sanctuary of the hotel. Our deluxe room over looked the pools and was extremely comfortable and spacious.  The food was of a high standard and staff were very helpful and friendly. The facilities were outstanding and there are a couple of restaurants within walking distance including Al Fassia.

Kenzi Menara Palace,HEARD2014 wrote a review Oct 2014,50,5* HOTEL - Really enjoyed,First time to Marrakech and what a wonderful hotel to have chosen. Stayed with 7 friends here and enjoyed every second. There was a slight hiccup with room situation because we added someone on to our booking last minute which didn't help things but overall I cannot fault anything about the hotel. The rooms were huge spacious and probably one of the best rooms I've stayed in. Food at the hotel was gorgeous with all three restaurants offering tasty dishes. We stayed all inclusive and when I say All Inclusive I mean All Inclusive - from the mini bar to wine with your evening meal to late night at the bar cocktails.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Mattfester wrote a review Oct 2014,50,A Perfect Hotel and Location,We have just returned from my first visit to Marrakech and what a fabulous choice of hotel we had picked. We chose the B&B option as my girlfriend has visited here many times so we knew of places we wanted to eat at in the evening.    About 20 mins from the airport although this doesn't affect your stay we arrived through the beautiful gardens and were welcomed with fresh Mint Tea and a faultless and efficient check in.    We had chosen a pool view room which was on the ground floor with access to your own garden area complete with sunbed chairs and table all in a high wicker finish. The rooms are huge with excellent facilities massive beds lounging area fridge plenty of wardrobe space personal safe and a large bathroom.    Outside the facilities around the pool were clean and efficient with plenty of staff and space to chose your own personal lounging area. All the sunbeds are a sturdy wicker with a thick cushion on them. Towels are collected by the pool with no issues of having them early to get the spot you want. Although the pool is not heated during the heat of the day its a instantly cool and refreshing swim which feels great once you are in.    Breakfast consists of a wide range of things from Continental through to Moroccan. A choice of eggs are available and made fresh in front of you. The usual fresh tea and coffee a range of fresh juices mineral water and fresh mint tea is also available. There is plenty of choice of hot dishes although their streaky bacon ranged from looking like it had been boiled to the stage of cracking. Apart from this the food was lovely and their was plenty of variety. With a range of areas to sit with ours being out on the terrace in the morning sun it was a perfect way to start the day.    Checkout was as smooth as everything seems to be at this hotel it was a shame to eventually come home but I would highly recommend here and will be defiantly visiting again  We didn't use much else around the hotel as we eat out in the evenings but everyone was very efficient including 'Abdellh' on the Concierge desk who helped us with our reservations,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Southampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mattfester

From the moment of arrival to the minute of departure we were treated like royalty. Fatima and Sharif were so welcoming and explained everything to us brilliantly. We were on the all inclusive option and I must say it was excellent value for money. There were 3 of us all ladies over 50 sharing a suite. Although the single bed was a bit small initially this was changed immediately and nothing was too much trouble. The food was brilliant no matter where we ate all the restaurants were just fabulous and the deserts - well these had to be seen to be believed. The display of deserts was always just beautiful matched only by the taste! They would not have looked out of place at The Ritz in London honestly!    We will be returning next year without a doubt.

Already from the moment you arrive you feel the great hospitality of every employee.  The room the garden the swimming pool the food - you need to do your best to find something wrong; it is beautiful it is clean it is from a very high quality level.  You feel yourself an honored guest by every employee.  The willingness to make your Holiday “a never to forgotten Holiday” is in the mind setting of every employee.  If you like – take a hammam and a massage; well organized with dedicated professionals.  The Center of Marrakech the Airport – within 10 minutes you’ll there.  Want to make some trips; go to Cherif the concierge. He organized beautiful trips with professional tour guides and driver very safe and comfortable.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Lisa011 wrote a review Oct 2014,40,Brilliant value,Booked this on low cost holidays and paid £236 for 3 nights b&b for 2 of us. Deliberately wanted not to be in the medina so this hotel is well situated only 10mins from the airport and the medina. They have a free shuttle to and from the medina a few times a day.  Rooms are very spacious with fabulous air conditioning. Pool beautiful with good service and pool bar for lunch. Only let down was the breakfast which for a 5* hotel was poor standard. Their Hamman is hit and miss depending who you get and I would book outside for this. Otherwise staff very helpful.  For first time Marrakech visitors you really should pick a riad in the medina. For those who want a pool with the odd visit to the medina this hotel is perfect at that price.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Tharini S wrote a review Oct 2014,50,Great place to get away and relax,I went to Morocco for 6 days and stayed at the Kenzi Menara as I had read that it was just outside the centre of town- so it would be quiet and peaceful. This was certainly the case. It was quiet peaceful and with beautiful surroundings.    The rooms are clean light and large. The staff were polite and friendly. The room service and food in the restaurants aren't exactly cheap but you can't really complain when staying in a 5* hotel right...? Breakfast was always with a great selection of breads pastries etc. There are free shuttle buses to and from the main market square every few hours which is handy- but to be fair the taxis aren't too expensive - as long as you agree a good rate in advance. Don't settle for the first price offered by the driver! Exchange rates at the hotel are fairly reasonable.    In trying to figure out what to do on your holiday ask to speak to Cherif who is the concierge there. He was fantastic in arranging day tours for us in private vehicles and the rates were reasonable. Cherif speaks a few languages too which is handy as communication can sometimes be difficult if you don't speak French or Arabic. In fact if you have any issues I would suggest you speak to Cherif as he seems to always take a proactive approach to assisting the guests there- shame he isn't in a management role at the hotel! I fell and injured myself whilst in Morocco but Cherif and a few other staff were great in assisting me for the few days I was in crutches.    Note that there are no irons in the hotel!!! if you want something ironed you have to pay the laundry fee so try and take clothes which are ironed or don't need ironing. Milk is not given with the teas and coffees in the room- if you want milk in the room to have a tea or coffee you will need to order it as part of room service and pay for it.    Be careful walking outside the hotel on your own especially if you are carrying a handbag. As you are outside the main city it can be slightly dangerous so just be alert.    Overall I had a great stay at the hotel. My biggest issue with hotels is the cleanliness and I can't really complain about the hotel in this aspect as they do keep it clean.    Just a quick note on going to Marrakech- be prepared to queue for quite some time at the hotel both on arrival and departure. The passport control queues were never ending and a few other people I spoke to at the hotel informed me that they too had spent a long time queuing at the airport. Maybe just keep some snacks and drinks to have whilst waiting!    I would certainly recommend the hotel...happy holiday!,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Croydon, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThariniS
Kenzi Menara Palace,Laura K wrote a review Oct 2014,50,"Relaxing, beautiful hotel and surroundings",We were lucky enough to stay at the Kenzi Menara Palace between 20th and 30th September and had an incredible time. If you arrive too late to eat in the restaurant on check-in day the free room service (for all-inclusive guests) between midnight and 6am is a life-saver.    We’d been reading up all the reviews on TripAdvisor for months before we went and made a point of seeking out the general manager René who responds personally to nearly all the reviews. He’s an extremely kind and friendly man who took the time to come and track us down after I emailed him and we loved how he made a point of introducing himself to as many guests as possible during our stay.    We couldn’t fault the food in the slightest as there was almost everything you could hope for and more (unless all you’re interested in is chips and chicken nuggets in which case you’re in the wrong kind of hotel). We made a point of booking both the Moroccan and Italian restaurant during our stay (with the all-inclusive package you can eat at each a la carte restaurant once during your stay) and both were amazing. The Italian restaurant in particular felt like a luxury dining experience and rather than offering just pasta and pizzas you could eat the likes of carpaccio of beef – heaven! If you like your desserts you’ll be drooling over the selection on offer in the buffet restaurant – the creativity of the chef was quite amazing.    As many of the reviews say finding a sun-bed really isn’t a problem at all and the pool area is particularly attractive. Yes the pool can feel cold when compared to the temperature outside; however as long as you edge into the pool slowly it’s extremely refreshing and you soon adjust to the temperature. We very much enjoyed the food on offer at the pool bar especially the pizzas and skewers. The local drinks were of very good quality and I’d especially recommend the local red wine.    We stayed in a ground floor garden superior room (when we booked through Sunshine Holidays we’d asked to have a first floor pool-facing room if possible but loved the room we were allocated so much we didn’t want to risk changing it. We stayed in 174 – a massive room with two wardrobes a spacious bathroom a free mini-bar and a lovely terrace that hardly anyone walked past except for the hard-working gardeners on occasion. We were extremely pleased to have been given a double bed as we’ve always ended up with twin beds for the past few years at other hotels; plus this was the biggest bed I’d ever seen – around 6 foot 4 inches wide we reckon – bliss!    The staff were all extremely professional and we shall miss many of them for their friendly conversation and jokes. Giving the bar staff waiters and reception staff lots of smiles saying please and thank you and trying to master (or re-master) some basic French really goes a long way and is appreciated.    The Kenzi Menara Palace has an extremely tranquil feel to it; so if you’re looking for a hotel where you can relax and unwind it’s a perfect choice. If like us you book through a holiday company that doesn’t provide you with a rep just speak to the Concierge – Cherif – who’s extremely helpful and can set up tours for you with a personal driver (our driver was Abdulla who was great).    The only suggestion I’d made is that the pool bar area (or even the pool bar itself) stays open longer in the evening as the pool area at night is really picturesque. Also despite some websites saying that the bars at the Kenzi shut at 11pm they didn’t shut until midnight when we were there. Also for other reviews mentioning the lack of evening entertainment this is partly true. There’s no animation team but there are singers most nights in one of the bars. I think this is probably because the hotel is aiming to give a luxury experience to its guests rather than create a party atmosphere and haul guests up on stage to take part in competitions like some other hotels do.    So a fantastic holiday all round – just wish we’d stayed longer! Thank you René and your hard-working team for giving us the truly relaxing break we’d hoped for.,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J2411PZlaurak

Kenzi Menara Palace,Sarah B wrote a review Oct 2014,50,Luxurious hotel - would recommend to anyone visiting Marrakech,Me and my partner stayed at the Kenzi Menara for a week early October.    It is absolute luxury and definitely worthy of 5* rooms are spacious and kept very clean (I also noticed hotel staff cleaning throughout the hotel on a daily basis) the gardens are beautiful and the pool is huge - I noticed some comments about the pool being cold it was so hot that I found the pool cooling/refreshing in the blazing October heat.    What really makes this hotel though is the staff everyone was so respectful friendly and helpful the staff really have been trained excellently. The concierge desk made it easy for us to explore especially Sheriff who speaks good English and organised everything for us e.g. day tours of the city sights and Atlas Mountains down to booking us tables at Moroccan restaurants.    One only slight negative would be the food; we stuck to crepes omelette fruits and cakes for breakfast as the English breakfast wasn't brilliant. However the pool bar food was very good as well as the room service menu. FYI there is a big shopping mall behind the hotel with plenty of restaurants and cheap food (Italian Pizza hut Burger bar TGI Fridays etc) so food was not a problem at all given the location.

The Moroccan restaurant we tried once but there were 2 choices on menu and food that was served was the smallest portion I have ever seen! Now for the Italian-thanks to Reda for making our evenings so enjoyable and the food in here is excellent! We ate here every night we could-the food is well cooked and presented-there are lots of choices and also a good atmosphere -something else that is lacking in main restaurant. As for the Pool Terrace where we ate at lunchtimes-food is ok but the service can only be described as ""casual"".We felt ignored a lot of the time and when we did get served it took ages to arrive.Some of the staff were downright rude and need some training! Also for our last 3 days there was no gin but we could get it at the lobby bar! We were offered 4 reasons why the gin was missing!

Our room was amazing and I have travelled a lot huge clean double sink separate shower and bath. Comfy beds and black out curtains. Our veranda was vast and walked straight to the pool. It was immaculate and enough beds to not have to ever save know. The pool is cold but with 40 degrees heat it was amazing! The lunch choice by the pool was plentiful as we're the drinks. I can see how some staff may seem a little rude....they work really hard for clients who are rude demanding and expect too much.....my smile and attempt at some broken French work more wonders than any tip....all staff were wonderful to us. The musicians in the Moroccan restaurant were brilliant and I can still see the one on the guitars huge smiles and waves at us as we passed. All waiters were friendly back as soon as they knew they were appreciated too. Salads fresh tagines tasty and although not the largest choice or with the best displays it is tasty fresh and changes every day. The Italian was exceptional. The shuttle bus was prompt and available.  Maybe not 5star but I would definitely recommend and return. Many thanks.  You get so much more back when you are polite and gracious.

Hotel was very clean and the lovely grounds well kept. The food was a little bland - hoped for spicy Moroccan dishes but even the Moroccan restaurant was disappointing. Often had to ask for drinks at meal times as we were overlooked by the waiters. Best meal was had in the Italian restaurant. Lovely large pool but some of the parasols (the first two that we tried) were broken so could not be opened. Staff were variable always polite but not particularly helpful - we had to ask for another bath towel the day before we left as one was missing but it never arrived.  We booked a trip to the Atlas mountains through the hotel's concierge Cherif and were promised a brand new air conditioned Mercedes taxi with a driver speaking perfect English and would not have to pay until after the trip and only if we were completely satisfied. In the event Cherif could not take the money (£70) off us quick enough and the taxi turned out to be an extremely old Mercedes and the only air conditioning was the manually winding down windows. The trip turned out to be along a well rehearsed tourist trail where everyone tried to take your money off you at every opportunity (they even took credit cards in the mountain village at the end of the road!) Don't expect to see lofty mountain peaks except from a great distance.

The spa was quite reasonable and high quality treatments!,Date of stay: October 2013,,Swindon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MS_UK2014

The staff especially concierges Cherif Rachid and Amine were very helpful. They helped make restaurant reservations book taxis and made the overall stay great. Thank you.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Francesca E wrote a review Sep 2014,40,4 lovely days,We have just got back from a lovely stay at Kenzi Menara Palace. The hotel is absolutely beautiful from the décor to the cleanliness of the hotel. I would definitely recommend it! The staff are really helpful all the time and they can not do more for you. We had a beautiful suite for 3 people which was huge! The hotel also provided water bottles everyday which was handy. The shuttle to the old town is really efficient and would definitely recommend using it to see the old town and to see the culture.    The food was good but there is not a huge variety if you are a picky eater like me! breakfast was always good but the pool bar could definitely benefit from more variety of sandwiches and not BIG meals which not everyone wants to eat at lunch time. In the Moroccan restaurant the food is tasty and would recommend this for the beautiful décor inside to the staff (Ali and the musicians which were great).    All in all a really great holiday and I would definitely go back!,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/660francescae

Kenzi Menara Palace,eyetgirl wrote a review Sep 2014,50,Our best holiday ever,We stayed at Kenzi Menara Palace for two weeks as a family of four. I wasn't quite sure whether hotel would be as good as in the brochure where everything always looks immaculate but I must admit that it actually looked even better than the brochure. So beautifully decorated!  We booked one family room but were allocated two massive rooms instead and you can just about imagine the kids seeing their own separate room with bathroom and a balcony! They were so excited! Room were very spacious indeed good size balcony and bathrooms all kept very clean. We had both bath tub and a shower in each bathroom. Comfortable beds TV with many channels and film on demand to choose prom coffee making facilities minibar filled in every day and included in all inclusive deals plenty of space in wardrobes and cupboards free wifi - we couldn't really complain.  The location was pretty good - in the quiet new part of the city yet only 5 -10 mins walk from new Al Mazar modern shopping centre and around 10 mins drive from the big square. For us as a family with kids it was ideal and we could go out for a walk anytime during the day without being pestered by anyone or feeling unsafe.  We loved the gardens surrounding the hotel they were very well maintained and allowed us to have some nice walks in the evening without having to leave the hotel. There were plenty of settees table and chairs around the main reception outside and the pool bar so you could sit down for a drink or just have a chat and relax. We loved the pool area too this is of course where we spent most of our time. Moroccans and French tend to have a slow start to the day so we had no problems with getting 4 sunbeds next to each other even well after 10am or 11am :) There were problems with getting the towels if we arrived to the pool area after 2pm -3 pm but usually someone from the staff brought the towels to us as soon as they were delivered. They also helped us find and move some sun beds if needed. There were two bars in the hotel: one situated just by the pools and a piano bar by reception. I think the latter one had better drinks and cocktails. We were also given some peanuts crisps etc with out cocktails there. Food in the main restaurant was very good always great choice especially the cake - they just looked (and tasted) absolutely amazing. Food was available for most of the day there were maybe 2 -3 hrs during the day when you couldn't get it but then there were snacks at the pool bar (unfortunately paid separately). Even better food was served at the Moroccan restaurant which was paid as well but you got one three course meal there per stay with the all inclusive deal. It was great evening with authentic Moroccan cuisine and some Moroccan music. Bear in mind that Moroccans are not always in a rush like we Europeans always on the go so don't expect your drinks to arrive to your table immediately after you ordered them. There can be quite a wait at the pool bar also I think they need more staff there. I have seen like 6 or more people standing behind or by the counter but usually only one or two were serving the rest was chatting. Also I couldn't understand why we had to sign off zero dirham bills for the drinks sometimes despite that we had all inclusive stay and drinks we ordered were from all inclusive menu.  Staff was very polite and helpful though some of them spoke very little or no English and that did cause some problems when ordering drinks or trying to get some more info on anything. I think this should be improved as this is an international language and in the places like hotels restaurants etc you'd expect people to speak at least some basic English. Nevertheless they all seemed friendly especially Cheriff the head of concierge. He helped us organize fantastic trip to the Atlas Mountains it was incredible experience and our guide Mohammed was very helpful. The hotel has got a pool of cars/ mini buses so apart from free buses to main square and back 4 times a day we were able to book a car at any time of the day at the same or even lower price than normal taxi which we preferred to be honest as hotel cars were comfortable and drivers did not try to sell us anything.  There was some evening entertainment at the hotel I think it was kids disco and then something for adults and some live music there as well. We preferred just having a drink or going for a walk in the gardens or Al Mazar mall as it was getting more lively there during the night. Also night market is an incredible experience. There were some activities organized during the day as well (like aquarobic kids games table tennis etc) but we felt way too lazy to take part in anything. There were lots of other people involved so I guess it must have been good.  Overall we loved the hotel and would definitely stay there again. It was beautiful place with lovely surroundings in a quiet and safe location with polite and helpful staff who made us feel special.,Date of stay: August 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Worcester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eyetgirl
Kenzi Menara Palace,Aden K wrote a review Sep 2014,50,The best hotel I've ever stayed in,Just got back from a 3 night All inclusive break and had the time of my life.  The place s like a palace and very classy indeed.  On check in a porter took away our bags and brought us a refreshing drink of mint tea as we sat down at the check in desk.  We got a suite and the rooms were massive and very well decorated.  A full fridge of AI rinks helped quench our thirst too.  For the guys- the beer is the local 5.2% FLAG (made in Casablanca) and comes in either 250ml bottles or little cans so two make nearly a pint.  The pool was fantastic too as were the meals.  My favourite was the Moroccan restaraunt which had a live two piece band playing traditional music in the corner.  French and Arabic are the primary languages but the friendly staff speak a very good standard of English to be fair.  Really would recommend this to anyone wanting a very elegant and classy place to stay.,Date of stay: August 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Durham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/559adenk

Kenzi Menara Palace,Eva K wrote a review Aug 2014,50,Wonderful hotel *****,We can strongly recommend this wonderful hotel about 10 min. taxi drive from the center of Marrakech The hotel is well kept clean with beautiful gardens and a very large pool that is cool and refreshing even during the hottest months.  We had bought an all inclusive stay and during our 11 nights the food was varied extremely delicious and thank God more morrocan than the tedious tourist-friendly chips and overcooked vegetables that we have had other Places. Here we had an abundance of vegetables tagine-dishes Salads spicy and tender meat and wonderful deserts.  The rooms are clean and spacious - a bit to the dark side but cool and with nice beds.,Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Copenhagen, Denmark",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evak151
Kenzi Menara Palace,lex28 wrote a review Aug 2014,30,Lovely Hotel...but let down by some staff,On Arrival to Kenzi Palace we were presented to a well maintained and pleasant reception area of the hotel which made us feel at home straight away. We had 2 Family rooms which were very spacious and clean. We stayed here for 10 nights on a B&B board.  Excellent hotel concierge Cheriff who makes the hotel and experience what it is do visit him and arrange your trips and taxi's with him. I cannot recommended him highly enough.  Very large hotel and great décor giving it an authentic experience for us to enjoy. Breakfast was the same every day but there was a lot of variety.  NOW...to the experience we found somewhat negative and I want everyone to read this carefully i know the reply from the manager here will somewhat try to sweeten my comments but they need to take action to maintain their reputation.  I saw first hand and with my family how some staff are ripping off the hotel and I will give examples of how we paid 590Dh to the piano bar for our drinks on 14/08/2014 around 6pm and that money was not cashed in the cash till. I asked for the bill but was given it by writing on a piece of paper and not printed off apparently the till was the not working. She then took the money around reception area to get change but I saw her put the money in her own pocket!!  Secondly make sure when you exchange your currency that you check the rate and amount before you walk off as we were short changed 3 different occasions by the same person on the desk. Other reviews on here and mentioned the same thing. I asked for £50 to be converted but was short changed and when I questioned him he thought he heard £40!?! this happened a few times.  Thirdly our key cards was changed 9 times over 10 days to our room as near enough every day it stopped working. Our digital safe also stopped working with our monies passports and paperwork all in there. We were left somewhat very edgy with this experience as someone from maintains came along casually to open our safe with a reset pin to open the safe. I will if our safe was tampered with or not?!  Fourthly (same as experience one) money was stolen by the poolside bar where I ordered 2 mocktails for total of 200Dh but as I paid the pool side staff my 200Dh was but under the till as again no bill was printed. I feel being a paid customer and not all inclusive that some staff take the opportunity to make some money for themselves and THIS point is what the hotel should be looking atas we didn't get ripped off as we paid for the drinks but the hotel is being ripped off by their STAFF!!! Some know exactly how to play the system and how to make extra money from dubious customers!  Rene is a great general manager and I look to hear from him I know he will ask why we didn't mention this when we were there but we were on holiday and not to leave feedback on everything we experienced as we didn't want to be treated badly by staff if we 'Named and Shamed'.  Most staff are very pleasant and giving a passing hello and smile and they shouldn't be forgotten its a shame that some staff truly ruin your hotel and culture of pleasing all holiday makers.,Date of stay: August 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Leicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lex28
Kenzi Menara Palace,Navy20142014 wrote a review Aug 2014,30,This is certainly NOT 5 star!,My family and I stayed in the hotel from August 16th to August 21st there were 9 of us in total and we had 4 rooms in the hotel 3 garden view rooms and a family suite room.    The holiday here started off well I called the hotel from London on the morning of flying out to make sure there was hotel transport organsised for us. One shuttle bus for my family of 9 cost us 300 dirhams although I was told 200 on the phone. A small blip at the start with cost but we put that aside.    Before deciding to stay in this hotel I think I read most reviews about it on Trip Advisor to ensure it was suitable as one of the travellers was my 78-year-old grandmother. Most reviews I read negatively explained how the hotel staff especially at the front desk were rude. At the time of reading these reviews I thought how rude can hotel staff really be… to my disappointment the reviews were right. The front desk girls greeted us with smiles at the start but whenever we needed anything over the 6 days and requested anything from telephone conversations we were always spoken to in a very abrupt and rude way. Their attitude towards PAYING customers was horrific by the end of the trip.    Small problems in the hotel over the 6 days included:    • one of our rooms not having gowns until the last day  • a broken safe in the family suite  • a shower that wouldn’t drain in another room resulting in flooding the bathroom  • a sink in one of our rooms that wouldn’t drain  • not much vegetarian food available in any of the 3 restaurants when served the buffet food was cold and dry and was clearly reheated from the afternoon and was just being reserved. One night we even went to the buffet when it opened thinking the food would be fresh then… we were wrong.  • Bringing wrong things to us though room service and then seeing we were charged for things we had not even signed for. This was mainly due to the huge language barrier most staff speak understand and expect international guests to speak in French.  • One of the hotel drivers lost my sunglasses.  * 2 of out rooms were on the ground floor... BAD MISTAKE! All we heard every morning at 9:30am was scraping around from the room above us from the cleaners.    All these small problems were taken with a pinch of salt.    Big problems resulting in a formal complaint and compensation:    • In my elderly grandmothers room the door fell off the cupboard landing on the floor and almost hit her! If it had touched her just slightly we would be suing the hotel and not just writing a formal letter of complaint!  • On the same day in the same room a tile fell off in the bathroom and nearly hit my mum! This hotel although beautiful on the outside has massive maintenance problems and needs to be addressed immediately. My mum and grandmother had to move room that day with no help from staff at the hotel.  • The biggest problem that occurred over the stay was when 2 members of staff a male and female walked into my room at around 11pm at night! They knocked once had their own master key card and walked straight into the room and did not wait by the door. My sister was in the middle of getting changed and immediately saw them come closer into the room. To her disgust she shouted and asked them what the hell they were doing walking into a guests room. Their response… looked at each other laughed and walked out! We were furious! How dare hotel staff walk into guests room at that time of night with no explanation reason or even an apology! My sister called the front desk immediately to complain about what had happened and the front desk said they were there to clean the rooms… umm… no hotel sends cleaners/ house keeping around at 11pm at night with no cleaning material or cleaning trolley. She said she would check with the duty manager who they were and would get back to us… of course no one did. The next day straight away in the morning I walked to the front desk and demanded to speak to the hotel manager. She knew exactly what I was going to complain about and said she could explain. Her explanation was that the hotel TVs had not been working and they were going around checking the TVs. Another rubbish reason… the staff who walked in did not say that our TVs in all 4 rooms were working perfectly fine the reception said they were cleaners the previous night and no one went to the other 3 rooms we had to check their TVs.    I’m sure anyone reading this would agree with me that these problems especially the main issues were NOT acceptable! Especially for a so-called 5 star hotel.    This wasn’t even the worst part! On the penultimate day of our stay we eventually got in touch with a manager called Nizar. Never have I ever met such a rude arrogant ignorant manager of a “5 star” hotel in my life! We explained all the problems to him very rationally and explained how staff walking into 2 young girls rooms at 11pm at night was disgusting and extremely inappropriate. His response was shocking… not once did he understand where we were coming from he merely laughed it off and said “this was not a major problem”. Me my sister and Mum spoke to him for a whole hour waiting for him to resolve and explain his hotels actions which resulted in him shouting at my Mum telling her to ‘get over it’ and literally walking off into his office leaving us sitting in the lobby shocked at what had just happened! He left us with someone else at the desk who didn’t have a clue about what was going on we asked him to call Nizar back out of his office obviously he didn’t come out.    I never expected a so-called manager to brush of a problem from a PAYING guest. He failed to understand that while we were in his hotel by the 5th day in total we had spent roughly 12 000 dirhams. His job is to manage the hotel and deal with issues and problems from guests; he did not do any of this and did not deal with anything we said. It was clear from the start he thought this was all a joke and did not take any of it seriously.    Overall the hotel staff need to brush up on their manners LISTENING skills customer relation problems housekeeping need a lot of training and in general most staff need to acknowledge there is a language barrier and not become rude and agitated if they do not understand someone speaking in English and asking them genuine questions!!    It’s a real shame to be honest because the hotel itself looks very nice it has a lovely pool the rooms are very spacious the suite we had was lovely and had two balconies. It’s just a real let down when the hotel is quick to take your money block off 5000 dirhams for each room at the start of your trip treat guests like rubbish and then not deal with anything when problems arise. The service and hospitality needs a lot of work. Genuine helpful staff were very rare considering the size of the hotel. It was just disgusting behaviour from a ‘manager’. My family usually stay in the Hilton Sheraton Rotana St Regis and Intercontinental hotels and unfortunately Kenzi does not come close to those hotels in terms of the ‘5 star’ aspect.    The ONLY person that was helpful and his name has been mentioned in other reviews too was Cherif! He worked for the concierge organised all our trips for all 9 people in my family arranged a wheelchair for my grandmother for every trip and was so genuinely helpful and polite. The only thing I would say about Cherif was that he wasn’t very clear about the excursions and what to wear and take with you something you would expect a concierge in a 5 star hotel to know.    If you foolishly decide you are still going to stay in this hotel don’t waste your time and speak to anyone but Cherif.    I am waiting for a response from Rene to see what nonsense she comes up with… when asked the hotel did not know who this Rene/ general manager was??,Date of stay: August 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Navy20142014
Kenzi Menara Palace,ellietravelstheworld wrote a review Aug 2014,40,OK for a couple of days or relaxing,My husband and I spent the last four days of our honeymoon here after having spent two weeks in different riads across Morocco.  It was our first experience with an all-inclusive hotel possibly also the last one (thanks to some other hotel guests).    We've had a lovely stay in Kenzi Menara Palace; our room was located on the top floor and had a view of the pool (although we had requested a quiet room with garden view). Thankfully we didn't notice any noise during our stay. The room was large and very clean and it had everything we needed.  The staff were super friendly and helpful. We had dinner in the Italian restaurant once and we are still raving about the main course with lamb it was divine! The tiramisu was very disappointing though (it said 'made with mascarpone' on the menu but the mascarpone was nowhere to be found). The other nights we had dinner in the buffet restaurant; we liked the tajines and the salads and the fresh tuna was amazing. The breakfast buffet was also very nice (so much fresh fruit!)!    A couple of faults though:  1. When we had dinner in the buffet restaurant the waiters may have been a bit too enthusiastic. I had finished my dinner but my husband was still eating and while he was having a sip of his drink the waiter just took away his plate. This happened more than once.  2. When we had finished our starter we went back to the buffet for our main course but when we arrived back at our table our drinks had disappeared and the table had been set for another couple. This also happened more than once.  3. We booked the all-inclusive package. We were told that room service was also included but when we called room service for some snacks (almonds and pistachios) and a drink (orange juice) they told us it wasn't included in the all-inclusive. We could only order soft drinks and sandwiches - but it didn't say so on the leaflet we were given upon arrival.  4. One afternoon we wanted to order a burger at the pool bar around 5pm but the waiter said it wasn't possible anymore apparently we were too late although our leaflet said we could order at the pool bar until 6pm.  Conclusion; they should be more up-front about what is included in the all-inclusive package and until what time you can order etc.    This is a good hotel to spend a couple of days of relaxing at the end of tour through Morocco. Mind you if you're not used to these kinds of hotels you will be in for a shock. We have never seen so many people order so much food only to leave it untouched. When you're at the buffet you will see some people that are behaving themselves as if they have never seen food before. I can imagine why staff would be rude but surprisingly they stayed really calm and friendly.  If you're travelling to Marrakech/Morocco for just a couple of nights we would suggest to stay in a riad in the centre of the city - you will find great food anywhere and you will get the true feeling of Morocco.,Date of stay: August 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Antwerp, Belgium",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellietravelstheworld
Kenzi Menara Palace,Lee R wrote a review Aug 2014,40,Would definitely go back,We have just returned from 10 days at this hotel and would recommend it and would go back maybe not with children as there was not much in the way of things to do for my 9 12 and 13 year old except of course the wifi that they were happy with. The staff were charming helpful and always pleasant and smiling. The suite we had was huge clean and very comfortable. My only criticism would be the shower cubicle that leaked same in the kids room. The food in the buffet was excellent easily as good as any European 5 star. The deserts were amazing. I would say the pastry chefs were amongst the best I have experienced anywhere truly delicious beautifully presented at every meal. The service in the restaurant was excellent the only thing being the waiting staffs lack of English but we got there in the end. Generally a really excellent hotel. Don't bother with the Morrocan restaurant in my opinion left us a bit cold although the service was excellent. The Italian was really nice but a little lacking in atmosphere.

Kenzi Menara Palace,LeaFH2014 wrote a review Aug 2014,50,Honeymoon heaven,After the build up to our wedding we were looking for somewhere to stay which would not only offer us a little bit of much needed luxury but a base in which to explore what our destination city had to offer. We found this in abundance at the Kenzi Menara. The hotel was fantastic so grand so clean and it reflected its Morocco roots perfectly! We arrived at 1am but we were still greeted by cheerful welcoming staff who answered all of our questions. Our room was huge tastefully decorated and the bathroom could have housed 20 of us! We had a lovely terrace which led to the pool area. The pool area was again was so well kept and getting a sun lounger was never a problem with at least 3 pool attendants to help puts beds together etc should you need it lots of umbrellas too!    We'd read a little about the staff and how some were a bit mardy we didn't encounter this at all in the restaurants or at reception / concierge occasionally the pool and bar staff were a little off but if you took the time to chat (& occasionally tip) they were fine! The food was of a good standard and the grill offered up some very tasty food nightly! You should definitely try the Italian & Moroccan restaurants on site especially the Italian it was beautiful!    The shuttle bus provided easy (& free) access into town the souks were a delight intense and a little crazy but so interesting. We also day tripped into the Atlas Mountains - definitely worth a day of your stay!    I must mention Hassan the entertainment guy - always a smile untiring energy and a real asset to the hotel - he made us smile daily just by watching his routines dancing and charisma with the kids! If I could suggest one improvement it would be to offer some evening entertainment for adults maybe a show or an act after 9pm when we'd had dinner - even 2 or 3 times a week.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Laura B wrote a review Jul 2014,50,Fabulous Week,My partner and i stayed here for a weeks holiday 17th july. we thoroughly enjoyed our stay i dont know why other reviews are moaning about the staff?! they were really friendly and helpful spoke good english! especially the girls on the desk and Cherif the conceirge man. room was spacious and very very clean - we upgraded to the suite! the bed was soo big! food was great - i couldnt resist having a chocolate cupcake each morning for breakfast they were amazing. pool is gorgeous plenty of beds and loungers to chose from. hotel cleaners never stopped and were so friendly and always said hello. we had such a relaxing week it was so nice and calm. if i had to fault it at all it would be that people are allowed to smoke indoors - being a none smoker this was really obvious to me but it defo didnt ruin the holiday. we would not hesitate in returning or recommending :) it was great!,Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leamington Spa, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/293LauraB

Kenzi Menara Palace,lavallins wrote a review Jul 2014,40,Trustworthy staff,This was a large functional hotel outside of the main Marrakesh city but close enough to travel in by taxi or the courtesy bus. Entertainment staff were incredibly enthusiastic and friendly. The restaurants were not great but adequate - food on offer in Marrakesh itself is far better value and standard. Drinks expensive and pool bar food monotonous.  Left some items (Nike trainers and hat) in our room and rang the following day. Very impressed to learn that the staff had handed them in to housekeeping who arranged for us to collect on way back to airport. That would definitely not have been the case in many other hotels so 5 stars to the staff for honesty.,Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"St. Neots, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lavallins
Kenzi Menara Palace,AlJanabi7 wrote a review Jul 2014,50,Amazing hotel,This five star hotel was really amazing.Our room had so much to enjoy. A large jacuzzi tub a spacious standing shower with glass doors and a big comfortable bed. There was also a big balcony with a view to the beautiful garden.  Breakfast were good will fresh fruits and juices fried eggs sliced salmons and everything you would want for breakfast. The hotel also offers 3 different restaurants the food was really delicious but very overprice compared to the exclusive restaurants in the city.  The reception personnel were very helpful in advise on what to do in the city especially my friend Sharif who works as a Concierge. He helped us arrange a tour around Marrakech which gave us the opportunity to see all of the important attractions. Furthermore he arranged a tour to the Atlas Mountains it was really memorable and worth every penny. So if you want to experience Morocco my advice is that you should go to Sharif and let him help you he is really an amazing man.  This hotel is located outside the city it would take about 10 min with a cap to downtown.,Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Malaga, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlJanabi7

Kenzi Menara Palace,rhowell92 wrote a review Jul 2014,50,Very Nice Hotel in new part of Marrakech,This nice hotel is several miles from the downtown of Marrakech. Lots of new hotels in this area and this one was excellent. It is laid out so you have to walk quite a bit to get to your room. The room we had was large and had two balconies. Very upscale and nice. I think the air conditioning was not up to the standard of the rest of the hotel. Never really got very cool in our room. The food was excellent and we ate several times at the hotel. I was surprised at how nice it was. We were part of a tour group of 35 and stayed on June 16 -17 2014.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Diane F wrote a review Jul 2014,50,First Time to Marrakech - Fabulous Hotel,Length of Stay 11th July - 18th July and only wish we could have stayed longer. We were 'All Inclusive' and from our experience this is one of the best 'All Inclusive Hotels' we have stayed at. Beautiful inside and everything was so clean with good amenities.We were concerned that the 'Ramadan Period' would have an affect on staff but there was absolutely no need to have worried as the service we found to be was nothing more than excellent. From reception to maid service and pool bar. With requests for more 'Coat Hangers' and 'More Coffee' in our room nothing was too much trouble. Food was really good with multiple choices. We just wanted a week to relax and that is what we got. The only cirticsm we would make is the atmosphere could be improved by some 'Background Music' by the pool and in the evenings by the 'Bar'. I am sure there will be entertainment further on in the season but this didn't really worry us for the week that we were there. I would like to say a big 'Thank You' to the 'Restaurant Matradee 'Karim' for outstanding service and good company and 'Cherif' 'Le Concierge' whom let us stay in our room a little longer due to our later flight. We couldn't find you when we were leaving to say 'Au revoir!' but we will be returning and we will find you!! Thoroughly recommend this 'Hotel'.

The waiting staff are excellent and have been from say 1. The male reception staff are great and always smiling.  Food at the pool bar is nice and tasty and breakfast is nice. Buffet I am not liking that much but I can be a little fussy. Hotel is kept very clean and the cleaning staff are always smiling.  My room was spotless last night when we got home and a beautiful smell was in every room. I think a euro or two tip goes along way so leave a few bob and the room get the VIP treatment.  We are all having a great holiday and my son is learning to swim. We are going to try the Italian tonight and put are five year old in the kids clud so will keep u informed.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Matt F wrote a review Jul 2014,30,Great hotel which is completely let down by the staff!!!!!,This is a great hotel but is almost completely ruined by the staff. The exception is the manager at reception who is always friendly and helpful. The rest are rude disinterested and abrupt. For a 5 star hotel (which isn't exactly cheap) you expect a level of service that this hotel doesn't provide. You are often made to feel like an inconvenience rather than a guest. When ordering a drink for example the staff often talk amongst themselves before serving you and when they do finally serve you there is no smile or even a basic level of customer service. Its straight back to talking to each other without even acknowledging you.    That said if you don't mind putting up with appalling staff then this is an excellent hotel. The all inclusive package is outstanding and the food is genuinely good which is rare for all inclusive hotels.    The pool is great and not too busy or noisy and the rooms are lovely.    Recommended but don't expect a smile!!,Date of stay: July 2014,,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C6301CUmattf
Kenzi Menara Palace,xxRach227xx wrote a review Jul 2014,20,Shame it's let down by some staff :-(,Waiting and Bar Staff are very rude inattentive lack basic service skills and a smile appears a physical impossibility especially in the pool bar where it just seems like you are interrupting their conversations between themselves and generally an inconvenience to them.    If you have food at the pool bar beware that it is brought out from the kitchen and put on the bar side uncovered waiting for one of the staff to bring it to your table during which time it can be subject to the flies on it that are around the bar why not leave it in the kitchen and get the waiters to come and get it when it is ready rather or cover it on the bar side rather than just leaving it. Although this seems to be the norm that the basis food hygiene standards are not adhered to as the bread rolls are just left out uncovered during all of the lunchtime service also!    All inclusive here comes via a wrist band but regardless signing for drinks or meals is randomly requested why do we need to sign when we are all inclusive and have our wrist bands on?? As our details were never checked via our room card our names varied from 'SERVICE AT THIS BAR IS VERY POOR' to 'Mr Potato Head' 'Mickey Mouse' 'D Duck' and 'Mr I P Freely' together with random room numbers.    Dark rum at the pool bar ran out at 11am and despite requesting action 3 times at the bar and once via reception to the bar manager none had arrived by 2pm on monday. Just to note dark rum supplies were obvious at the other bar but of course a member of staff collecting a bottle or even picking up a phone to request one was far too much effort and shrugged shoulders was the only response.    Sunday seems to be when the management team return as the marked change in effort is apparent.    There are some positives as per some of the other reviews on here including the friendly staff on the concierge and housekeeping.    I am sure the management will respond to these reviews as they have done with many others with positive spin however the importance should be placed on action being taken to address the issues as this could be a fantastic place that is currently being let down by the issues noted.,Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Rotheham, South Yorkshire",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xxRach227xx
Kenzi Menara Palace,Craig H wrote a review Jul 2014,30,Beautiful place spoilt by the staff,We are currently staying here for 4 days and are 1.5 days in.

Reasonably quiet hotel not over full so lots of room around the pool for sunbeds/beds. Lovely big pool.  Food is nice.  Staff in the moroccan restaurant are excellent friendly attentive and courteous including the live music.  The housekeeping staff are very friendly and polite.    Negatives    All of the bar and restaurant staff including reception with the exceptions of the ones above are uninterested make you feel like an inconvenience miserable inattentive and do not make a positive impression of the Moroccan culture.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Rebecca G wrote a review Jul 2014,50,Perfectly Relaxing,My Husband and I stayed in the Kenzi Menara Palace from the 3rd - 10th July 2014. The Rooms are huge and luxurious and cleaned very well daily. We had a pool view and that normally means a noisy room but the Hotel is so peaceful and large that we didn’t have any noise and also got to look out onto the Atlas Mountains which were just stunning as were the hotel grounds in general. We had requested the Honeymoon Suit as it was our Honeymoon but found out this was given to a couple who weren’t even married and hadn’t even requested it so I was slightly disappointed – however the standard rooms are amazing regardless and its never guaranteed so I was still very happy with what we had.  There are a few activities pool side such as Yoga Aqua Aerobics and also a little game of Football if you wanted to participate just at the front of the hotel but still within the compounds of the wall that surrounds the hotel we you don’t even notice at all. It is so very hot that its hard to take part in activities but the groups like how to make Morrocan Tea were brilliant as you could sit down and learn. (not strenuous at all)  There were some building works taking place whilst we were there which no one told us about but the works stopped around midday and you hardly noticed it as they were behind a temporary partition which was green so didn’t even stand out of place.  The Hotel was I would say not even at half capacity when we arrived which was great as we had pick of the sunbeds and it was almost silent round the pool. The pool doesn’t open till 9am which was good as there was no fighting over the sunbeds at 5am like in some resorts!! In General the people were French and everything is geared up for the French. I found this a massive advantage as you knew more or less what everything was. Everyone can say Bonjour and Merci; right?  The food was lovely watch out for the birds! I stuck to the covered hot food which was things like rice pasta and cheese sauce Lamb Tagine Vegetable Tagine and some fish dishes. There’s something for everyone. The puddings were aplenty! And between 12.30 and 4.30 there is a Pool Bar which you can get yummy pizzas sandwiches and chips etc Dinner is late at 8.30pm so really you need to have a late lunch. We stuck to bottled water which is readily available but we did drink the ice in the drinks and we were both completely fine.  The hotel is almost empty at night we would have liked some sort of entertainment but there was none at all. Everyone seemed to disappear after dinner and by 10pm it was only the few British people left in the bar.  I totally forgot to utilize the Spa but did have a look round it and it looked amazing had all hi tech equipment and the ladies knew what they were talking about my Husband used the Gym a few times and said it was Good.  Special mention for Hassan the entertainer – he worked his socks off and was brilliant throughout. He taught us how to make Moroccan Peppermint Tea and spoke very good English. He is very good at his job and a great credit to the hotel.  We would thoroughly recommend this hotel but would say you need to go All Inclusive as it is VERY expensive otherwise. But then you get what you pay for. This is a great hotel.,Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Rickmansworth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/772rebeccag

The hotel is lovely very clean large rooms and bathrooms and very comfortable. The pool is fantastic very large and spotlessly clean really comfortable sunbeds and large 4 poster type sunbeds too. You are really looked after the staff are very helpful and accommodating. Hassan took us for gentle gym sessions round the pool and aqua aerobics. He was also great with the children and organised games and entertainment. The restaurant manager ensured we were well catered for the bar manager and his team helped blow up balloons for our friends celebration they made us a beautiful and very yummy cake. Buffet offers a good selection of food and there is an Italian and Moroccan restaurant. We had lunch at the pool bar which offers a small but tasty choice. We had good wine and cocktails. Nice spa facilities available and many of the girls enjoyed manicures and pedicures. Highly recommend we had a fantastic weekend and would all like to go back!

Kenzi Menara Palace,F F wrote a review Jul 2014,40,I would definitely stay again!,For my first girls holiday I could not have chosen a better hotel in marrakech! When we first got to the hotel it was beautiful we sat and discussed things with the manager and sorted our rooms. Everyone was so welcoming and we were offered the traditional tea. Our room was sorted out pretty fast and our bags were already their when we arrived. We were so surprised at how spacious the room was it was more of an apartment. We had a huge lounge area to chill in and a balcony which was very pretty! The hotel is spacious you can walk around for ages it is actually a palace!    The pool was a lot of fun there are sun beds surrounding it and also a bar/restaurant right by the pool which you can order food from till late in the evening. We really enjoyed the food at the bar however it did not agree with our stomachs so we didn't risk that again which was such a shame! We decided to give the food another go however at the restaurant inside the hotel which again resulted in the same outcome of us having terrible stomach aches.    Overall the hotel service was amazing the night staff were actually so fun. They would make conversation we could literally speak to them all night! We had a really good time the staff made the experience even more enjoyable.    I would definitely recommend hitting the clubs near the hotel which is a two minute walk. I wouldn't recommend taking a cab from the hotel to the clubs nearby as they charge 'night prices' ridiculous and again it is only a 2 minute walk. Before we'd go to the clubs we'd eat and smoke at sky lounge it is such a beautiful place and the food there is amazing. We would then go to the clubs which is free for girls entry and drinks all night every weekdays. This saved us tons of money and we had a lot of fun! The music is the same as it in london apart from a couple however this is fine as we're here to experience a different culture!    The hotel lacked entertainment this would've been nice especially near the poolside gives the stayers something to look forward to!    I would definitely stay at this hotel again :)!

At times I'm nervous about AI but we got a good deal and the reviews were positive. We were delighted. Having stayed AI in the Caribbean Africa etc previously I can say this hotel offers the most comprehensive package we've had yet w mini bar easy to book quality restaurants transfers to the centre food served on site 24/7 and room service. Even the buffet was lovely with plenty of healthy options.  We stayed during the World Cup with tourists from all over. The atmosphere was jovial and the staff were excellent. Even at the weekend when the hotel was very busy the staff were attentive and table service in the bar or restaurants was always prompt and proactive.  This is a well run friendly and respectful hotel.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Stephaniekl90 wrote a review Jun 2014,50,"Beautiful peaceful hotel, high quality food",We went to Kenzi Menara Palace in June just before high season. The timing was perfect because it was not crowded in the hotel and the weather was perfect not too hot. We booked the normal double bedroom and it was very large with a terasse outside. Big modern bathroom everything very clean.    We chose for this hotel because we were looking for a luxurious place but not too modern we wanted to see the moroccan interior design. This hotel has a combination of modern classic and moroccan design. We are also happy we chose this hotel because of the location. We were having doubts between this once and Pullman for example. The Kenzi Menara is way closer to the centre with the free shuttle bus you are there in 10 minutes.    The food from the buffet is from very high quality. Breakfast everyday the same but many different things; salads vegetables eggs bacon etc. Lunch and diner were different everyday and real moroccan with a large selection of tajines. We liked that they did not serve typical western food like fries.    And to save the best for last.. the desserts are heavenly! They look like they are from a cooking magazine like they are made by the best patissier and they also taste divine.    Also there are 2 a la carte restaurants one moroccan and one italian. The Italian one was just reopened after redecorated and the food is amazing real italian. The Moroccan restaurant we liked less too heavy flavours.    We also liked that we did not have to get up early to reserve a bed at the pool ( like sometimes in other resorts). Beautiful big pool surrounded by beds and also by several lounge beds with cushions and curtains very luxurious. What we did miss sometimes was some music at the pool. Sometimes it was a little too quiet. Also there is no animation But if you are looking for a relaxing peacefull vacation this is the place.    And if you do want to party on 5 minutes walking distance you find 2 clubs. One of them is Pascha and you get free entrance from the hotel on working days.    We want to go back here!,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Brussels, Belgium",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stephaniekl90
Kenzi Menara Palace,Hemma S wrote a review Jun 2014,40,"Great hotel, great facilities, just check prices if not all inclusive",This is my second visit to the Kenzi Menara and overall we have been pleased. The pool is great and relaxing to sit around the pool attendants are great. The staff at the hotel are very friendly and attentive.    Our only negative experience of the staff was when we caught the shuttle bus to the medina - once we arrived there was a man waiting for the shuttle to stop he greeted our driver and said he was his brother and that the souks were all closed and he knew some other shops which were open. Having previously been to Marrakesh before I knew this was probably not the case so we politely said to him we were happy on her own he did keep on at us for a while but then soon departed. The souks were all open so he was totally lying! I have heard of these scams before and it was lucky we knew not to listen but its concerning that some hotel guests may get swayed into following this man so wanted to raise it as a concern. The hotel are not to blame for this but I would question why this man was greeted by the shuttle bus driver and introduced to us as his brother who would help us.    Breakfast is great but be sure to check the price of the food if this is not included in your package as you might get a shock when you get the bill especially if your not a big eater at buffets!    Our room was nice and spacious with a separate lounge area (although we didnt use this). Plenty of water bottles provided daily. We did request a twin room and this was confirmed at time of booking but the room we were put in just had 1 king size bed. We had a balcony but unfortunately this looked out on to the delivery bay so we didnt have a nice view which was a shame.    Really enjoyed our stay and will definitely come back to Kenzi Menara and will recommend it to others just be alert to a few things!,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hemmas2015
Kenzi Menara Palace,Staxo wrote a review Jun 2014,40,Absolutely loved it and definitely recommend this place!!,Me and my friends decided to book this holiday as a nice girly getaway for 5 days. We booked it pretty last minute and was not expecting too much from the hotel however upon arrival we were very pleasantly pleased. The hotel manager greeted us and took our bags straight to our rooms and introduced himself and gave us free traditional tea.    When we walked in to the rooms we were so surprised at how beautiful the suite was. It had a lovely large living room spacious bedroom bathroom with a bathtub and shower and a spare toilet. The room was very well kept and clean which was most important. The room also had a lovely little balcony with tables and chairs which was so nice to wake up and enjoying the view with.    I spent a day exploring the local area and becoming comfortable with the hotel and their facilities.    The outdoor pool is beautiful water is very clear and has lovely sun beds all around for the residents to use as well as large beds decorated with pillows and shades almost like a boudoir. I ended up spending a lot of time relaxing in the evenings with some music and sleeping on the beds.    There is a restaurant outside by the pool which has an amazing view as you get to overlook the pool and the whole hotel as you eat. The food there was pretty cheap in comparison to the other restaurants in the hotel (around 80-120 dirhams). The food was nice however my stomach wasn't accepting of it and it left me with a very bad stomach ache. In the evening I decided to try the other indoor restaurant which was a buffet style there was a large variety of foods from pastas to curries. However I was very wary of eating meat again after my experience at the outside restaurant so I stuck to pasta and mash which was lovely but not worth the money we paid for it. We paid 280 dirhams each which we all thought was ridiculous for what we ate thus we decided to not eat at the restaurant anymore and explore the local food places instead. The only food we all genuinely enjoyed was breakfast which was free as a part of out package. Lovely fresh pancakes and traditional breakfasts as well a wide bakery selection and hot beverages. To be on the safe side we ended up eating at McDonalds and KFC. There was also a sheesha bar which was 2 minutes away called skyline that had lovely good which we all loved and there was a cafe that also had lovely Italian food which was cheap and very nice at the same time.    In terms of location I would say it was perfect. The hotel provides a free minibus which will take you to and from the hotel to the square/souks (markets/bazaar). This service was extremely helpful and cost efficient as one thing that totally threw me off guard was the prices in morocco. I found that everything was a lot more expensive than I had expected and more than people had said in their reviews.    At the beginning we were a little silly and unsure of how to haggle prices down however towards the end really got the hang of it. Cabs would first say 250 dirhams for a 10 min journey and then reduce it to 100 if you walk away or if you haggle it lower and lower.    The souks I thought were really smelly because of the horses everywhere but it was very nice to look around and see how others live and experience their culture. The souks get cheaper the further you go in and once again require haggling to avoid being ripped off.    During one of the days we went quad biking which we arranged with out hotel. This was one of the most amazing experiences ever. We went for 2 hours and it was absolutely amazing lots of fun. I was so rubbish at the beginning but really got the hang of it by the end and would really recommend to others.    The night life at marrakech was amazing!!! The clubs were only a 2 minute walk from the hotel and ladies get free entry as well as free drinks all night which was really good. The clubs however only get busy and upbeat around 1-1:30am and they close at 5am. Clubbing in marrakech is a must we went to the club 555 and also theatro which is also a must!!!    To conclude the hotel is great haggling is a must plan your days with different excursions and you will absolutely love this trip.

Kenzi Menara Palace,bratouf wrote a review Jun 2014,30,"Wrong category, it's not a palace but a reg. hotel.",For the record just came back from the hotel and we have seen many rooms during our stay (4days):  -Room was not checked before so we arrived in our room with a bathtub broken sink stuck…We ask for a change of room. Not possible “hotel is fully booked”. They came to fix it the next day! Meanwhile we had to use rotten corners and hairy shower. Once fix after construction work to replace the bathtub to clean the bathroom they just wiped with our towels…!!No product no detergent…Yep 2 minutes later “Your room is clean sir”.  -Bathroom & bedrooms are dirty (hairs on the floor...) stains on bedsheets sofa…you don’t want to step on the floor barefoot.  -Pool area is noisy and music is loud  -Cleaning ladies don’t knock to check if they can “clean” the room; they enter and when they see you sleeping they apologize and leave; never seen that before!  -Services is a disaster ! between 15/2 hours for lunch break at the pool for one plate happened every day for 3 days. Breakfast: when I ask for tea or coffee it never came. I asked many time but finally got up and get it.  Pricing: too expensive for the quality of service  -Confidentiality: we came for a personal reasons as also other many VIPs which I knew. What a surprise when the manager came to talk to us and proudly was giving the name of these VIPs which I knew. I held my tongue but could not believe it.    Good points:  -After troubles we had in the rooms the manager was very reactive; maybe he finally picked up we were from the same group as VIPs.  -Moroccan restaurant: it is the best restaurant in the hotel unfortunately Morocco grows very good wine “gris” which you cannot get; only cheap headacke rosé; what a pity.    Finally when you carry “palace” in your name you have to ensure you can handle it. Most of the above points are unacceptable for a palace but good enough for a regular 400 bedrooms hotel.    TO SUM UP: good for group bus and discount internet travel trip; if you're looking for a nice stay with nothing to worry about I'd recommend you to pass on.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,paris,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bratouf
Kenzi Menara Palace,Jennylambert wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Excellent Hotel,Stayed here for four nights with my daughter we wanted a hotel where we could relax and just enjoy some down time. We were not disappointed. We were on the 'All Inclusive' package which was very good. We ate at the buffet restaurant for all meals and there was a great choice all of which was fresh and tasty. Special mention must go to the wonderful selection of deserts so much choice it was hard to decide what to have. The waiters and waitresses were all very helpful and the service was very good. Pool area was well kept and the attendants very helpful with the sun loungers and parasols (which were needed as the temperature reached 40+ degrees while we were there). Special mention must go to Sharif the Concierge he was so helpful in arranging a city tour for us at a very good price the private tour was in a very nice car (with air conditioning!) with a very knowable driver who could not do enough for us if you want to see all the sights of Marrakech including The Marjorelle Gardens this is the way to do it. The only thing I would say is that I agree with the previous post that during the England Italy match the Italian guests saved the best seats and a very scary Italian woman got very annoyed with anyone else who sat there we ended up watching it in the bar with some other English guests only a small thing and it certainly would not put me off returning to this hotel.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jennylambert
Kenzi Menara Palace,katieshaps wrote a review Jun 2014,40,Lovely but not faultless,"We stayed here for a week and had a fantastic and relaxing stay. The room was spacious and the pool area was exquisite (although the water was freezing!). We never had a problem finding a sun bed and the hotels location allowed for us to also explore the city of Marrakech.    This hotel however is not without fault. We opted for the all inclusive package which meant we were given a blue band on arrival that we had to keep on (and physically could not take off) for the duration of our stay. What we quickly figured out was that this band marked as a reminder for staff that we were ""second class citizens"". For example by the pool we were served sodas by the glass while other guests were given bottles. We also had to go to the bar to get served while those ""higher class"" guests had the privilege of being served at their sun bed. Bizarre as we were obviously still paying. It was also a shame that all the best seats for the England v Italy World Cup game were reserved for their 'special' conference guests. Again we were pushed aside.    The food was average and we decided to eat out most nights despite being all inclusive (the Morrocan restaurant was lovely and Ali the waiter was by far their best member of staff). The pool bar food on the whole was ok although the thai chicken salad was less of a salad and more of a herby chicken bolognese! Language was a slight barrier but the tourist industry is mainly French. All in all the hotel looked like it was 5 star but the service and food let it down.    Despite these faults we had a lovely stay even if we did fend for ourselves!",Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katieshaps
Kenzi Menara Palace,JAB324 wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Excellent,We returned last week from a 4 night stay at this hotel. We were met at the airport and transported to the hotel by mini bus. Check in was quick and easy.    Rooms  We had 2 rooms which were connecting..  We had a couple of issues with the room but these were dealt with very quickly.  The rooms are amazing. Lots of space bathroom is large and equipped with hairdryer.  We had a pool view room which was lovely.  As we were all inclusive the soft drinks in the mini bar were included.  Rooms are very clean    Pool  Very large pool with steps at one end. Pool staff are amazing and very helpful. There is a pool bar for drinks and snacks. This is where we had lunch.    Restaurant  We ate in the buffet restaurant for breakfast and dinner. Plenty of choice and the waiters are fantastic. Always ready to help you to a table and arrange drinks.    Bars  Branded drinks are available for the all inclusive package. It was so nice to have a drink either at the bar or on the seats outside before and after dinner. Nuts olives and crisps were served with drinks.    Spa  I had a facial treatment and one friend had a massage. Both very good treatments.    Felt totally spoilt the whole time we were at this hotel. Very friendly staff and nothing was too much trouble.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Juana O wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Fantastic hotel!,We have just returned from a five day stay in Marrakech as a family and we loved everything about the Kenzi Menara Hotel. We stayed all inclusive and the service we received was great everyone was very helpful and friendly and many spoke very good English. The staff at reception the porters the pool bar staff were specially helpful. We travelled with our 7 and 10 year old children and our family room was perfect very spacious two separate areas with sliding doors to give privacy and both areas with TV sets and a great selection of kids films and a daily filled minibar. The food in all restaurants was excellent we enjoyed lovely breakfasts in the buffet restaurant with a large selection to choose from we had lunch often in the pool bar and we recommend the fish brochettes we dinned in all three restaurants and our favourite was the Italian restaurant but the children loved the mini puddings on offer at the buffet restaurant. The hotel is very well located they run a minibus service to the main square in Marrakech (only 10 minutes away) and back to the hotel at regular times during the day. The hotel gardens and pool are very well kept and our children really enjoyed playing in the huge pool and we enjoyed relaxing by the pool after the busy visits to the souks and the medina. There were always sun beds available and the pool staff were very helpful when providing us with towels and parasols. We didn't use the Spa so can't comment.

Kenzi Menara Palace,cupcake3040 wrote a review May 2014,50,The best all inclusive we've stayed in!,We treated ourselves to 3 nights at the Kenzi Menara after a couple of weeks travelling around Morocco. The hotel was fabulous and my partner and I agreed it was the best All Inclusive hotel we've ever stayed in.    The service is quick - a little more Africa time than the pace of London! - but who's in a rush when on holiday. The staff were very friendly and polite. English is their third language so it was a bit more difficult than in other countries we've been to and I can only assume this is the reason behind the negative reviews other people have left. We really couldn't fault the place.    Food was good and AI even included the mini bar and room service. Plenty of choice in the buffet and at the pool bar and there are two good a la carte restaurants.    The concierge arranged a taxi to the airport for us which was more expensive than if we'd travelled on the metre but still less than £10.    The room was huge. Bigger than our entire flat in London! We had room 253 which was a garden view room but is in the horseshoe around the pool. As it's in the corner you can't see the pool unless you're standing on the balcony hence why it's not classified as pool view.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Atli-Mar-Josfatsson wrote a review May 2014,50,Excellent hotel and staff,We stayed at Kenzi Menara in end of April for six nights with our three teenagers celebrating my wife’s birthday.  The location is good peaceful and away from the noisy centre. Accommodations are very spacious we had a family room with a large bedroom and large living room plus another large bedroom total of more than 90 square metres. Our room was on the second floor with large balcony overlooking Atlas Mountains and the garden.  We took an All inclusive package and do not regret it. We could choose from many assortments at the breakfast buffet fruits vegetables breads cheeses eggs or omelettes yoghurt and sweets. Both lunch and dinner had enormous varieties of food to choose from suitable for all of use including our vegetarian daughter and our athletic son who prefers meet.  The garden area is amazing 50 metres long swimming pool and lot of space for sun benches plus an outstanding “rest area” on the outer side of the area a 2 x 2 metres with curtains if you want to cool off from the sun or simply take a nap.  The staff was very friendly and helpful both at the reception and restaurants. Sharif the concierge took good care of all our needs when booking excursion to the Atlas Mountains to Medina the Souks or to the new town.  Great hotel we highly recommend and we will come again.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Spl70mk wrote a review May 2014,30,"Nice rooms, Views, but expensive Bar and Food",We stayed here as a special city break for my wives birthday April 2014 only 4 nights it was booked through Voyage Prive as a package bed and breakfast only. On arrival checked in and promptly shown to our room It was huge! massive bed  balcony overlooked pool and the Atlas mountains in the back drop. We was here to do the shopping souks and sight see we only had 2 full days so on each headed for the Jemaa el Fna which is the main square / tourist spot The hotel offers a free shuttle bus at certain times of day with the last at 7pm return. On our first day there was to many people who wanted to get to the square so the hotel had another much older vehicle that they clearly was having trouble trying to start eventually we all got into the second van and set off only to come to a stop just outside hotel main entrance. After a short wait the hotel provided taxis for us all to get into the main square we shared a cab the driver dropped us in the middle of a different area and we did not know where to get the bus back from. In summary After a day on your feet and haggling away  returning to the hotel is a welcome break we spent a few hours one afternoon by the pool and the views are truly amazing the only thing that lets this place down is the poor quality of breakfast buffet and the price of everything is as per UK example my wife had a cocktail i had a rum and coke with a 330cl beer  these 3 came to 280D £28  i think if it was not for the superb pool with that view that this place would get more not so good reviews  would i stay again NO i would book a Riad in the souks  they are better value and you get an authentic Moroccan house.,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Milton Keynes, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Spl70mk

This is a very well run organised hotel which is very large but despite this has a very warm friendly atmosphere.  It's location is wonderful just on the outside of the hustle and bustle of Marrakech it was a calm oasis to return to in the evening. The architecture of the hotel is attractive and the outdoor pool and pool bar/restaurant was fantastic. The hotel bar itself is quite nice with excellent staff who are very friendly however drinks are not cheap! Perhaps the bar could use better background music to create a better atmosphere.  Breakfast each morning was very impressive with alot of selection catering well for everybody.  The room was wonderful very large with a nice decent balcony. I would recommend a room on the first or second floor overlooking the pool/gardens.  Facilites include well maintained clay courts which unfortunately I didn't get to try and an excellent hotel gym.  The only criticism I have is that the bedrooms come without iron and clothes have to be sent to housekeeping to be ""pressed"". Although I requested for three shirts to be pressed only they were both washed and pressed resulting in my expensive shirts shrinking! This was my only problem. Also although I was assured I wouldn't be charged for this the charge did appear on my bill which I requested to be removed. Sorry but had to mention this!

Kenzi Menara Palace,kiminaboat wrote a review Apr 2014,30,Lovely hotel with Some lovely staff,This hotel is in a great location and is of a high standard in terms of decor etc... It is just a shame to have such a lack of confidence in the staff. We traveled through Thomsons and boy am i glad we did as our Rep was fantastic.    When we arrived at the hotel we were asked to fill in some paper work. All was fine and the staff seemed friendly enough. They then asked for a credit card to put charges on but we said we would sort out any extras at the end of the holiday (Very glad we did this). They then told us we would be charged holiday taxes at the end of our stay. As All inclusive guests we assumed that this would not apply to us as we had already paid a package holiday price. After about an hour we were shown to our room and were a little horrified that there was only one bed between the three of us. We had asked for a twin room with an extra bed. Instead we received on king sized bed. I called reception who assured me another bed was on its way. 2 hours later after a lovely lunch we met with our holiday rep. There was still no extra bed. It took our Rep to phone the people in charge to sort out what we had asked for. Even then it was not until 6 hours after arriving in the hotel that the bed was made up and we were not in a twin room. Fortunately the bed was large so not too much of a problem.    The extra bed was more of a camp bed which was a shame as we had all paid the same money and of course didn't receive the same. I understand it can be hard when there are 3 adults in one room but in the UK this would normally mean a cheaper rate.    Anyway when we met with our Rep we were told we where the only people with Thompson staying there and that they had not had very good experiences with the staff as everything took a lot of persuading for anything to happen. I have to say i agree.    Any time we spoke with the reception staff whether it was to call our rep (to book trips etc) or to book into one of the restaurants (Which were really good) we were met with less than enthusiastic or helpful responses.    Our Rep had left a letter with reception to be posted through our door about our final day coach collection two days before departure. On the final afternoon we called our rep as we had not heard anything. We were very unimpressed when we found our it should have got to us.    Having said all of that the service in other areas such as at the pool and in the 3 restaurants was very very good.    On the last 2 days there was a big conference at the hotel and there were quite a few changes. There was a bbq at lunch time by the pool which was amazing but it felt like it had all been put on for the conference and to keep the hotel lobby free of people in pool gear due to the conference.    The shuttle service was very good but we went into Marrakesh on a tour first which really helped us find our bearings etc... I would also advise a trip to the Atlas Mountains as they were incredible! You can see these from the hotel but only on a very clear day.    The all inclusive meant we could eat as much as we wanted unfortunately the drinks menu was very restrictive with only 5 cocktails 4 of which had banana in which i am allergic to and therefore didn't really make use of this.    We went with the intention of having a spa day for my Birthday however when we went to book it we were made to wait an hour for them to take the 'menu' and photo copy it so we could pick treatments. After this and the very big prices we decided not to go for this.    I know i am sounding a little negative don't get me wrong this is a lovely hotel in a great location with SOME amazing staff. It is just a shame that the negatives seemed to take over.    I would not recommend this hotel i am afraid and there are so many others near by with the same location and same star rating.,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,birmingham UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kiminaboat

The hotel was very clean and the building was beautiful. We were three people and we stayed in a Family Suite which we found to be very spacious and much to our liking. However we did have to wait a few hours after arriving for our hotel room to be ready. During this time we were able to have lunch we were served tea and were given a tour of the hotel by Saraa Saritta.One member of the staff that was outstanding was Saraa who was extremely helpful kind and friendly and we strongly suggest befriending her upon arrival to the hotel for a more enjoyable stay. The staff at the hotel were very hospitable and welcoming. Although the hotel and staff were very nice we found it to be quiet without much to do throughout the day. The waiters working at the buffet restaurant were very attentive and the food offered included traditional Moroccan cuisine. At dinner we had an exceptionally attentive and friendly waiter whose name we unfortunately were unable to get before leaving the hotel but his efforts were still greatly appreciated. Noureddine and Bouchra who were working at the restaurant at breakfast stood out in particular for being especially good. Two ladies working at the bar Soukania and Dounia were very kind and friendly and good people to get to know when staying at the hotel.

I believe it has recently been but by a new group. They have work to do. It is at best a three star hotel at present. Avoid external rooms as the hotel is between busy roads and some rooms are noisy and affected by street lighting. Ask for an upper floor overlooking the pool.

My only criticism is triple check who the hotel arrange childcare with; the first couple of days we had a lady who didn't speak English and although she was very good with our daughter it's always preferable knowing instructions don't get lost in translation.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Jinny wrote a review Apr 2014,20,Sadly Disappointed they didn't tell us the pool was empty the whole week!!!!,If I had to sum up: SLOW SERVICE - NO ENTERTAINMENT - NO POOL - Nice food - friendly staff  We arrived at the hotel last week for a romantic week away. We wanted a nice relaxing week away somewhere lovely and this is where we decided to stay.  The hotel its self is nice clean and well kept. Most of the staff are friendly and the food is great.  However if you are looking for a five star feel with a two star service then this is the place to be. The entertainment is none existent. The service is SLOW! If you want a cup of coffee you will wait 20 minutes minimum. If you want new bath robes you will wait three hours if you remind the reception to send you new towels an hour after first asking you will be told to be patient. The hotel has two restaurants additional to the main buffet. We booked into the Moroccan restaurant two nights in advance however they forgot to book us in!!! We had to make alternative arrangements although there were several empty seats.  I really have mixed reviews here but what has really annoyed us and made us feel really short changed was the fact that the swimming pool was out of working order there was no water in it. And after trying to complain to the staff they just say 'tomorrow it will be ready'. That was said to us every day we were there. We had five days without a pool and on the day we left it was filled. You would feel that we should be compensated for that! They didn't even bother to respond to our complaints for that reason I'd say not to bother with this hotel!,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leeds, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IntoTheGeek
Kenzi Menara Palace,panyan1960 wrote a review Apr 2014,40,A very enjoyable break!,My husband and I had a weeks stay here at the end of February. We had booked a garden view senior suite and could not fault the accomodation so spacious! This is a lovely hotel not huge all rooms are based on the Riad style in groups around a central courtyard and on 3 floors. The grounds are lovely well kept and great views of the Atlas mountains.  We stayed all inclusive and unlike other AI hotels you are not limited to one meal per stay in the a la carte restaurants. Apart from breakfast we dinner in the buffett only on our first night the rest of the time we ate in the Moroccan and Italian restaurants. Both were very nice good choice in the Italian especially for my husband who is vegetarian. Our favourite was the Moroccan mainly because Ali the waiter was excellent! So friendly and helpful made us feel really welcome and comfortable. The breakfast buffett was great good choice and I loved the pancakes! Plenty of fresh fruit and of course pastries!  Overall the hotel was quiet although the location is nothing special. We did ask to be moved because we were kept awake a couple of nights by barking dogs; unfortunately they had no pool view suites available. Double glazed windows may help........ We found most of the staff to be very helpful especially the guys on the concierge desk. We had a couple of minor issues but they were down to a misunderstanding and happily resolved.  Our only major gripe would be that we had requested a late check out when we booked the information provided to us by the hotel on arrival was that this would be possible just book with the front desk. We tried to do this and were put off they kept telling us to ask the day before departure etc etc and guess what? There were no rooms available so no late check out! Not happy! They cut the bands off at 11am so we could not use AI! We were able to use the showers in the spa to wash and change later though.  The outdoor pool is not heated so it was very COLD I did however take the plunge and have a swim! The area around the pool had plenty of loungers and the staff were generally attentive.  We didn't use the Spa but I did use the gym which was fine a good choice of machines and water and towels are provided.  The free shuttle bus into the city is good we used that and taxis to get about. Taxis were generally quite cheap make sure you negotiate a price before getting in though.  Our suite was immaculate more room than we needed really cleaned thoroughly every day and we always came back to some sort of decoration with our clothes laid out on the bed in pretty patterns even rose petals everywhere!

Kenzi Menara Palace,Sidrah17 wrote a review Apr 2014,40,Enjoyable experience,I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel.  The staff were very friendly and the concierge Sharif was very helpful. He spoke perfect english and made us feel very welcome.  He organised a trip for us to see the Atlas Mountain which we really enjoyed and would recommend to everyone.  The breakfast was enjoyable but the food was repetitive.  The rooms were very big and spacious and I would recommend a room facing the pool.  The pool was huge however it was suddenly closed which was a downer for us.  I would recommend this hotel if you don't want to stay in a Raid but still want to stay close to the square.  I would definitely stay here again.,Date of stay: March 2014,,"Hampshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sidrah17
Kenzi Menara Palace,Jean D wrote a review Apr 2014,40,Dickie,Just back from an enjoyable week at this hotel - a very relaxing time. Not usually a lover of all-inclusive but the choice and standard of food was exceptional and the choice of drinks was very generous and a nice opportunity to sample some surprisingly good local wine and beer. Several visits to the delightful Moroccan themed restaurant were a real treat- and the waiter(an apology I can't remember his name) was very charming and professional. The Italian was good too but needs a little more atmosphere.  The enormous bedroom was of exceptional quality spotless and amazing free wifi everywhere. How good to have a fully stocked fridge but remember to take some English tea bags if you need your morning cuppa!  It must be difficult in such a large complex to create a welcome feeling but the staff were very obliging and after a few days it was nice to be recognised and acknowledged. Some basic schoolgirl French was appreciated!  The pool had to be closed at short notice for repairs and as keen swimmers we requested the opportunity to visit the nearby Kenzi  Club hotel. The charming Duty Manager made all the arrangements and we had an enjoyable day but we were glad to return to the more peaceful Menara!  Despite the comments of some visitors who seem determined to make themselves miserable on holiday go to the Kenzi Menara and enjoy it also the excitement of the Medina and the kindness of the people.,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Newbury, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeandD7015DP
Kenzi Menara Palace,JMacL0nd0n wrote a review Mar 2014,40,Gi-normous beds & super helpful concierge,I recently enjoyed a 6 night stay here. We booked a standard room and even though it was facing the road it was fab the hotel is lovely and the location is good too.    We had the biggest bed I’ve ever slept in a very large room and bathroom with balcony. It had all the usuals; bath shower international TV channels hair dryer safe bottled water provided and free wifi throughout the hotel.    The pool set up is great there’s a bar & café by the pool however the water is really cold. Views of the mountains if it’s clear too. But what did my head in was seeing a lady in a headscarf dipping her toes in the pool while across the other side of the pool were loads of brit & French ‘all inclusives’ with their tops off!    The hotel is all-inclusive but you don’t need to be & it would be shame to go all that way and not to see the sights. We were very happy with the usual breakfast included in the rate and going into town to enjoy the local culture and night life. FYI - much better food at a fraction of the cost rooftop sunsets are amazing and the free shuttle bus is great and takes about 10-15mins. A taxi back can vary from 50-80dhs.    The best thing about the hotel was the friendly concierge. He was brilliant and helped us organise a tour to L’Ourika in the Atlas Mountains. A highlight of our trip and I would really recommend it. We left at 9:30 and came back around 3pm. You really can’t believe you’re only a 4hr flight from the UK! Like all Moroccan people our guide was a lot of fun.    FYI – there is a shopping centre behind the hotel 5-10min walk away. It has a big Carrefour for supplies and some cafes and shops.,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMacL0nd0n
Kenzi Menara Palace,mainane wrote a review Mar 2014,10,Guilty until proved innocent... Ridiculous service,I would not stay at this hotel again even for free. The service was nothing short of ridiculous.    The first night a friend and his wife came to pick us up to go to dinner. I went to greet them at the reception and took them to our suite while my pregnant wife was finishing up getting ready. We were planning on being in the room for less than 5mins. To my surprise as soon as we got to the room I received a call from someone in the reception demanding that my friend and his wife come back to the reception area and drop off their IDs before being allowed in our room even for the 5 mins we were planning on spending in the room. I've been to many hotels in morocco especially Marrakech but I was never ever treated like this where the hotel is insinuating that I am renting my room for folks to do whatever they please in it!!!    The breakfast buffet was horrible with tasteless blend food. Even the Moroccan specialties like the Harira soup was bad with undercooked ingredients.    Our room was next to the supplies room that room service uses every morning. The first day we were awakened to very loud noises and slammed doors all coming from the supplies room. When we complained to the staff in the reception area we were given a pre-canned answer that the noise was made by other guests in the hotel who were leaving the hotel at 8:30am!!! As expected the next morning we were awakened again at 8:30am with the same noise coming from the supplies room    The incident that takes the cake is at checkout. The checkout line was long so my wife suggested to stay in line to pay the daily tax imposed by the hotel mind you we already paid almost $400 online for 2 nights. In the meantime I took our small suitcase to the car. While heading to the car a hotel staffer followed me asking for the room number I gave him the room number without thinking much of it. I got to the car put the suitcase in the trunk and to my surprise the same guy is standing by the car demanding that I go back to pay $12 for the daily hotel tax!!! I told him that my wife is already in line to pay the fee and he walked me back to the hotel.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Angela987654321 wrote a review Mar 2014,20,Definitely not worth the stay - no recommendation from us!,We stayed here for 2 nights after spending 3 nights at a riad in the medina and another 3 nights in the medina in Essaouira - and we would definitely NOT recommend this hotel. As we had already spent 6 nights in and around Morocco we figured for our last 2 nights we would stay somewhere quiet and with a big pool. Unfortunately we just felt cheated. It is SO overpriced for what it is; trying to be a luxury hotel but it is simply not even close. The staff were friendly and very helpful which is appreciated however we cannot recommend it as is as it is not what it claims to offer.    If you are used to 4 star hotels in north America or Europe you can say that this hotel is a 3 star equivalent. If it cost only about 80$ a night perhaps we would recommend it however they charge far more than this! Frankly I am amazed at all the people who have given such good recommendations.    At the Kenzi Menara the rooms were run down the food was SO overpriced and underwhelming and the location is almost depressing.    We are a well travelled couple and we always wonder why people pay so much more money for such poor quality hotels like these. We stayed at a beautiful riad in the medina for 70 Euro a night including breakfast. The quality was miles ahead of what the Kenzi Menara offered yet they charged well over 100 Euro a night (and this was an offer!). If you are worried about the busyness of the medina - don't be! The riad's offer a sanctuary behind the walls and you will have a much more rewarding experience of Morocco!,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Gothenburg, Sweden",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Angela987654321
Kenzi Menara Palace,Davina J wrote a review Mar 2014,50,"A+ service, cleanliness and staff",Stayed here as a couples long weekend.    Staff all speak a variety of languages which is useful for monolingual people like myself.    Friendly welcome on check in our room was on the ground floor with a balcony that led to the pool area ideal!    ROOM  Modern spacious warm two toilets sofa bidet huge bath one of the biggest beds i have seen.    The room was immaculately cleaned every day with two courtesy bottles of water placed in the fridge and two more more by the bedside tables.    HOTEL  The reception has lots of comfortable areas where that you can sit in three restaurants and a huge pool.    POOL  The pool area has towels that can be used for the pool area no need to bring your own bar staff will put up umberellas as needed    BREAKFAST  Breakfast was very continental however fresh pancakes eggs and omlettes could be ordered from one of the counters in the breakfast room.    TIPS  Staff do not ask for tips but you get the feeling it is kind of expected but then by the end of your stay you actually want to tip people for the service they have provided.    WIFI  There is free wifi in the hotel it reaches the rooms and pools as well as the reception area.    THE SQUARE  Marrakesh square is about a 20-30 minute walk away but this hotel runs a shuttle three times a day to and from the hotel. You will be greeted by people saying they are the guide for the hotel will show you down the street and expect payment. Do not listen to the hype you can walk through the markets alone.    TAXI  The fare from the airport to the hotel we were charged 300dhs (and then he tried to add another 30 for 'nightime' fee and bags) then by the time we got used to the prices the fare was 100 DHS on the way back so once you get off the plane tell them you come to Marrakesh all the time to be charged a fair fare!    The fare from the square to the hotel is between 50-70 Dhs again drivers will charge as much as they think they can get.    FOOD  Ate at the hotel once the food was ok just ok I preferred the food elsewhere personally.    SHOPS  There is a small shopping mall 10-15 minutes walk away with a Carfour Supermarket clothes shops and many take aways (Deep Pan etc) prices are cheaper than they are in the UK    SPA  There is a spa attached to the hotel where we got changed after using the pool before our flight but we never used the facilities.    NIGHTLIFE  There are two nightclubs on the same strip although we never went to them.    I would stay here again without any hesitation.,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,midlands,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/372davinaj

Kenzi Menara Palace,Hina23 wrote a review Mar 2014,40,Lovely break away for 4 nights,Just came back on March 3rd after spending four nights here with my mum and my two older sisters and I have to say it was lovely. Originally me and my family were supposed to stay at Kenzi club agdal Medina but when we got there at about 8pm the manger guy who was really nice his name was Jawad told us that something had gone wrong with the AC in the rooms so we had to stay in this hotel. I think the actual problem was that they were bait over booked! But because this hotel seemed nicer we didn't mind!! This hotel seemed a lot quieter and calmer and more premium so we were happy! Even the food at the Kenzi club wasn't nice! There were too many kids running around! We had access to both hotels bt we hardly went back to Kenzi club! When we got to Kenzi menara Palace we had to wait a while for a rooms which was bait annoying because we were so so tired and then eventually when we got to our rooms they were abit far apart from each other which was really annoying but because we were so tired we just thought we would leave it. Then the next day we had breakfast which was lovely! Because we got all inclusive everything as included which was really nice!!! The breakfast was mainly continental and there was also an option to have freshly made omelettes which was really nice! There was also fresh fruit! The only thing was that after the 3rd day it got bait repetitive so maybe a variety would've been nicer! But everything was fresh. Another annoying thing was that breakfast was served from 7-10:30 but if we came down at like 10am then most of the fresh stuff had gone and they took their time bringing more out!! Thats the same for lunch and dinner! We didn't want to wake up at 7am every day because the whole point for a holiday was to relax and lie in!!! Anyway the pool area is really nice too! it wasn't that Hot but defo better than UK so we were happy! The only bad thing was that the outside pool was as cold as ICE! It was so so soso cold! No one could swim in it!!!! So I was a little disappointed with that! Then lunch wasn't bad! The buffet was really nice some times though i didn't like it all the time. There was a certain cheese or oil or herb they used in their food which made me feel sick!! Have no idea what it was!!!! The food was quite posh! The desserts were AMAZING tho! Loved them!!!!! Bar food at the pool wasn't anything special! Not much really! I never ate there because there wasn't much of a variety! Dinner was nice but not great! Everyday there was something different but if we didn't come dead on 7:30 then the food would be cold and sometimes not very nice! Desserts were amazing again!! One night we ate at the italian restaurant in the hotel which was quite nice! This hotel is in the old town so Iwould defo have a look in the New town too! There are a lot more restaurants and night clubs there! We didn't go to any night clubs because we were there for a short amount of time and mainly to just relax!!! The people were all friendly! Sometimes the waiters forget to et us something when we asked for it but thats not a major thing but one thing i didn't like was how little english everyone spoke!! Even when I ordered room service the guy just spoke French! it was really hard to communicate with them! And the house keeping to for ever to deliver stuff like toilet roll or an iron! Even when they delivered an ironing board it was broken and really really rubbish!! THis is a really nice hotel but it just needs like some refurbishments! Even in my bathroom there were ANTs everywhere! That was really horrible because they were coming out of the holes!! It was clean but I think because of the heat! Sleep Quality was good however the pillows were quite hard its a really good location only like 15mins from the new town! We went to his amazing Thai restaurant called Mai Thai in the New town! If you like thai food you must go!! We went to the square called Jemma Al fna where the little shops are that was nice too. The other annoying thing about the hotel was that it didn't provide us with any info about Marrakech! No guide books! The concierge was helpful well the english speaking guy was. He set up a tour for 600DRMs with this really lovely guy i think his name was Faisal! He drove a mercedes and took us to some nice places! We visited Menera GArdens that was so rubbish! We had to walk loads and because my sister was pregnant she couldn't walk much!! So don't go there! Its nothing like the pictures on google! We went to the Saadian tombs which were 10DRMs each! So so so so rubbish! There were no tour guides to tell us the history behind it so we didn't know what was the historical meaning behind it! We went to Bahia Palace but we didn't even go inside! Waste of time!!! Basically the best thing to do is Shopping in Jemma Al Fna theres a complex there too called ETs Bouchaib Complexe d'Artisana its really nice!! You can buy all sorts of stuff!!! Evil eyes bracelets shish! basically its a better quality shop where you can buy everything instead of going to Jemma Al fna! but its a tad more expensive! Not a lot more! infact some stuff is cheaper! Also the Spa in the hotel was just amazing! We had our massages and I had a hammam royal body scrub! Was so amazing!!!!!!! That was like the best thing! I also had pedicure which was average! Overall My experience was really good! My mum got abit ill though from the food! have no idea why! I think the cheese had gone off and my mum ate it and didn't realise!! I will be definitely going back to marrakech but for longer!!! Its a lovely place the people are lovely and even the cabs are not that expensive!! But i wouldn't recommend women to go alone in the night to places! Its a lovely place and even this hotel is really nice! Rooms were cleaned everyday which was good!!!! Because it was so big you did have to walk a lot everywhere! Once I actually got lost in the hotel!! I couldn't find my hotel room!!! The rooms all look the same!! But this hotel is really nice! the food is different and is a mix! Although there was hardly any morrocan food!! it was still nice! Dessert was my favourite! Different desserts everyday!! :) Even though there were a few flaws i still had a good time!!! I just hope they fix these flaws otherwise it will go downhill!,Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/435hs

It was a fantastic experience overall. The staff were all very helpful going out of their way to answer our questions and tend to our needs even though English was often their 3rd or 4th language (after Arabic French). The concierge (who spoke perfect English) was especially helpful arranging all of our tour guides (unfortunately I can't remember his name even though he wrote it down for me; I lost the paper). Breakfast was included which consisted of a well laid out buffet with made to order omelets and Moroccan pancakes. There was plenty to choose from even for our very picky children. Our room was great (a suite). We also opted for our first hammam experience and a massage both of which were fantastic.

For work I have to carry two iPhones since one is for Europe and the other one for the United States as many people do these days. I left my computer case at the hotel with the US iPhone I wouldn't be using a hundred dollar bill very well hidden in a a pocket. I wasn't even thinking that I might get robbed I just had it there from my previous trip as it was the custome. When I got home I realized the iPhone and the money wasn't there. I didn't take the computer bag anywhere else so I'm sure and positive it was the hotel personnel. It's painful to say this since we all know how poor the country is but please be aware of your belonging specially if they are valuable you can't easily replace. I will recommend the hotel but under serious precautions.

Kenzi Menara Palace,martha82 wrote a review Feb 2014,40,Good hotel,We stayed at Menara Palace for a week in September. The hotel is absolutely beautiful with a grand reception area and big spacious rooms.  It's also very nicely located if you want to avoid the manic centre of Marrakech. This means however that most of the times you will be using a taxi for your transportation which is relatively cheap but don't forget to always negotiate the price! The hotel also provides a free ride to Marrakech. Ask reception for the timetable.  The pool area is also nice to relax and enjoy the sun. Be aware though that you are only allowed one towel! That was a bit odd but staff would only hand one towel per sun lounge.  I think that the negative point goes without any doubt to the staff of the hotel. They are slow indifferent and not really helpful.

You must try the spectacularly interesting pool in the spa - easily the best jaucuzzi hydrotherapy pool I have been in. Above all ask to meet Sharriff the concierge - he speaks english with a genuine array of English accents - very funny but much more than that he gave us great advice on visiting the souks including drawing us a little map even though we did not book the souk tour with him.

Free wifi worked well. The only complaint is that they do not have any irons or ironing boards.,Date of stay: January 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aessack
Kenzi Menara Palace,ARC333 wrote a review Dec 2013,30,A little bit Fawlty Towers.,This hotel has a lot of potential but it lacks in the execution. The pool hours are quite restricted as is the bar. The food is ok but after a few days of the same buffets it gets pretty boring. Rooms are large clean and generally pretty quiet but there are not irons or boards supplied in the rooms and only one available for usage from housekeeping for the whole hotel. Being there for a business conference and with a 24 turnaround for pressing (expensive) through the laundry this isn't acceptable. Staff are a little undertrained. I also kept getting locked out of my room which was annoying as my room was the furthest away from reception.,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ARC333

Kenzi Menara Palace,carlosfpardo wrote a review Dec 2013,40,"Clean and nice, pool hours were funny, breakfast was ok",I stayed here because a conference was taking place in the hotel. The location was I guess fine (10 minutes to the Medina etc) but I would have liked to stay near or at the city rather than in the outskirts.  The hotel is spotlessly clean very nice and my room was very spacious. Internet worked well. Breakfast for some reason was plentiful but I didn't find it very good (maybe I'm not used to that type of food).  One funny thing was that the pool was only open during the time that I had to work (after 9 am and until 5 or 6pm) so it was impossible to use it at any point during my stay!

Kenzi Menara Palace,meispete wrote a review Dec 2013,50,Kenzia Menara Palace,I don't really write reviews but there are some pretty mixed reviews for this hotel and I didn't know what to expect when we were moved to this hotel after ours was overbooked.  The hotel is lovely its on a large site its secure and private. The pool is large and clean the 3 restaurants are all of good standard.  Picking up on some of the points I read before we went -  - The airport taxi was 20EUR late at night pretty non-negotiable. The driver didn't hassle for a tip didn't try to rip us off and was friendly enough. (It was 10EUR return from a taxi in the hotel car park.  - The staff were NOT rude to us. They were all very polite and friendly and nothing was too much for them. They do not expect tips.  - The room was large clean and serviced daily. We looked over the gardens and it was quiet. The TV was all in French but there was a large on demand section of films.  - We were all inclusive and wore the band so the bar / restaurant staff knew. We were treat well by the staff who would bring drinks to the table / pool lounger.  - The wifi was more than fast enough and available throughout the hotel and pool. It was around 2MB/S - enough for us to Skype home to the children on a night check facebook/twitter. Granted it wouldnt be enough to run a company on but you're in africa on holiday - come on!  - Food was available all day and was of a satisfactory standard. I'm not a fussy eater but if I was (or if the kids had been with us) I might have struggled - a lot of food cooked in tagines! The pool bar was handy with its burgers and pizza.  - 5 minutes walk down the road was a medium sized shopping centre it had a few shops a supermarket a dominos pizza pizza hut burger bar chinese Italian Virgin Cafe.  - The shuttle to Jemaa El Fna runs 3 times each way per day. We nearly didn't go but I'm glad we did - it was certainly an experience!  I'd certainly recommend this hotel. I probably won't go back as there's a lot of the world to see but if I was in need of some winter sun I'd suggest Marrakech and this hotel to anyone!,Date of stay: December 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Darlington, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meispete
Kenzi Menara Palace,Susan O wrote a review Dec 2013,50,Nice place,We had a cheap trip to Marrakech a place I always wanted to see and the hotel was a perfect base calm and quiet in lovely gardens with a nice pool. The staff were all friendly and had time to talk. The breakfast buffet was fantastic. There is a spacious and comfortable bar where we would have enjoyed our evening drink if there hadn't been a very loud singer with electronic backing competing with piped music from the other end. We were saved by the discovery of a Carrefour supermarket - exit through the back entrance and its just down the road - where you can get beer and wine. We got picnic stuff from there as well rather than using the hotel restaurants which though lovely were empty at this time of year. There is a shuttle bus to town which was totally reliable but stops at 7 p.m. so if you want to enjoy the night market it's 80 dirhams for a taxi.,Date of stay: December 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Glossop, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusanO560
Kenzi Menara Palace,Steven M wrote a review Dec 2013,10,Worst hotel in Morocco,During our recent Morocco tour we decided to upgrade our hotels versus those suggested by the tour company. The sofitel in Casablanca was incredible and the Sofitel in Fez was wonderful but this choice in Marrakesh was a big mistake.  Staff really rude on our way to the first room they showed us all the stairways and halls were dark even the bell boy needed a flashlight. Room faced the street and was noisy. We asked to change and their attitude changed from rude to obnoxious! Complained to the GM and finally received extra pillows and coffee for the room and changed our two night stay into one. returned early to Casablanca and went back to the Sofitel,Date of stay: December 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Dana Point, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StevenM904
Kenzi Menara Palace,Dawn1512 wrote a review Dec 2013,50,Honeymoon haven,We booked our holiday at the last minute and I have to say it was fabulous. The hotel is beautiful and the weather was amazing. I can't understand the problems people are having with the staff I speak s little French and that was very much appreciated in the bars and led to lots of conversations with the staff. The food was generally very good especially the desserts but there is a lot of olive oil used so if you're not a fan you may get a bit fed up with it by the end of your stay. The internet did drop out occasionally but I found it a small matter of putting a simple code in. Ideally situated for the airport and the attractions of marrakech.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Lorna W wrote a review Dec 2013,50,Calm relaxing oasis in an amazing (but crazy) city,This is a fantastic hotel with great staff. I have just come back from a lovely 2 week break with my husband and they could not have done any more to make our stay special.    We chose it after extensive research on tripadvisor so thank you fellow travellers for your feedback. One of the main reasons I eventually chose this hotel though (as not all reviews were positive) was the fact that the hotel director takes the time to respond personally to all feedback on this site. I felt that this showed good attention to detail and that was a very good starting point I was not disappointed this same attention to detail is evident everywhere - the hotel is very well kept beautifully clean and all of the staff friendly and helpful. The hotel director takes the time to walk around the hotel introducing himself to guests and requesting feedback. We had no reason to complain about anything with the hotel but I am confident that if we had it would have been quickly addressed. We were particularly impressed with Najib in the Italian restaurant and Salhome(?) in the pool bar but the service was great everywhere. The whole concierge team were also fantastic they gave us good advice on what to see and seamlessly sorted us out with a Sahara trip booking when First Choice/Thomson let us down at the last minute by cancelling the trip that we had booked with them. The concierge guys also drive the shuttle bus which is a great way to get into Marrakesh itself (just 10 minutes) and was always there on time to pick us up again when we had had enough! It would have been good if there was a slightly later shuttle bus run (last return is 19.15) to allow for some time in Marrakesh in the evening but a taxi isn't expensive so not a huge problem. The hotel helped us out again on our last day when First Choice forgot to pick us up for our airport transfer at my request they phoned our rep and then provided the hotel shuttle bus and a concierge to take us to the airport so that we didn't miss our flight.    Our room was fantastic we had requested a quiet room with good views of the Atlas mountains and the room that we were allocated was quiet beautifully appointed and with both pool and Atlas mountain views.    We used both the Moroccan and the Italian restaurants the food was great in both although I personally preferred the food in the Italian. The ambience is special in the Moroccan you are seated on Moroccan sofa-style seating in a nicely partitioned space with traditional musicians playing live music. The ambience is less good in the Italian as it is a large room with no partitions and 'muzac' but you can watch the chefs at work if you like through a large glass window into the kitchen and the food is fabulous especially the ice cream and sorbet:-)  The buffet restaurant for breakfast and dinner was also excellent with a good variety of dishes both Moroccan and European. It was always clean and well presented. We were able to have breakfast outside on the terrace in the first week which was lovely but after that it was a little too cool but there was good heating inside the restaurant. The pool bar/restaurant is also perfect for a light lunch and the food there is freshly cooked to order.  We were on all inclusive but we did tip. People always thanked us and we never felt like it was expected when on a couple of occasions we didn't have change so couldn't tip we still got great service the next time so we didn't have any problem with tipping.    One feature I really liked was the pool service. Towels were provided rolled up on the loungers. to occupy a lounger you just rolled out the towel. I haven't come across this approach before and loved the fact you didn't have to carry your beach towel around with you especially once it was wet! The pool itself is huge and kept clean - we watched the pool guy hard at work cleaning it every morning One word of warning though the outside pool is not heated it gets cold at night in November and that meant that although the day temperature was lovely the pool itself was cold. The hotel is only 10 mins from the airport which is a great short transfer although it is just off the flight path you only notice planes when outside and its not really disturbing we didn't mind it but I thought I'd mention it as some people do.    In summary we loved this hotel we loved Marrakesh and we loved Morocco but we were really pleased to be staying away from the madness of the Medina in this beautiful hotel. The place is amazing and we found the people welcoming and charming. We got back on Tuesday and I'm already trying to work out how soon we can return!,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"East Grinstead, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LornaW32
Kenzi Menara Palace,James H wrote a review Nov 2013,30,A nice hotel ... but ...,Really struggled with this review. There are some parts of this hotel and parts of my stay I really liked and some ... well I was enormously let down.    Firstly the good: The room was fantastic. A huge 3 room suite with two separate courtyards was a bit overkill for a single bloke on business ... but I loved it. Comfortable palatial the room itself I could not fault. Up there with some of the best 5 star rooms I have stayed in (and that is a lot!).    The food: (note also the bad here) The food tasted specatacular. An awesome array of starters mains and deserts for all meals. Again from a cullinary taste point of view ... could not fault the presentation nor the range ... brilliant!    The Conference facilities: Great room with natural light. Good sound quality and good attention by the hotel's AV staff ...    Now the bad:  Unfortunately a few things seriously outweighed all the good.  1) Service: At the bars It was very poor. Rude arrogant standoffish would be a few words to describe service at most of the bars. I understand alcohol is not he most coveted drink in Morroco but still the service was in general appaling. The restaraunts it was somewhat better but still ...  2) Room service: I wanted an iron ... could I get one? Not a chance. I had to pay for someone else to iron my stuff and that took over 6 hours. ... again very very poor for a hotel like this  3) Room service: I asked for beers and water to be topped up in the bar fridge ... did it happen? No not once over the whole week. I Asked 4 times and then just gave up.  4) Food: Yes I got food poisoning. I was sick for 1.5 weeks after this trip. Not quite sure what caused it. I was careful with my water and drinks ... so can only put it down to the food. Take immodium / gastro-stop with you!  5) The internet: just shocking ... would drop out at least 5 times a day and you had to enter a long code to reactivate. It was not just me everyone experienced the same issues    So some strikingly good and some strikingly bad ... would I stay again? Probably not I'll try somewhere else.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Perth, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamesH262

Kenzi Menara Palace,CountLippe wrote a review Nov 2013,40,Lovely comfortable Hotel,Recently spent 4 days at the Kenzi Menara on a bed and breakfast basis. Check-in was a bit of a slow process but once over we were allocated a lovely largecomfortable room with all the amenities one would expect including a lovely balcony overlooking the pool and extensive and very well kept gardens.Our friends were allocated the room next door which was very helpful. Breakfast buffet each day was well set out with a wide choice of food and our party (4 adults) found the dining room staff attentive and professionalalways quick to re-fill our coffee and to clear away our used plates etc. We spent one and a bit days relaxing by the pool and had lovely comfortable pool beds with 2 towels per person. There is a little noise from the planes taking off from the nearby airport but they were infrequent. Ate lunch at the pool bar and the service was quick and the food good. Also tried out the indoor pool and steam room. Bit fiddly to book our free steam session but otherwise fine. Lovely indoor pool with lots of clean towels etc. Also used the gym which was small but perfectly adequate with a good choice of fitness machines and a trainer in attendance. Ate in the hotel buffet on two evenings and found the food and service to be of a very high standard especially the puddings!! The price of the buffet at around £22pp was comparable with other hotels we've stayed in. The mains menu was also different on the 2 nights we ate there. Also used the free hotel shuttle service which on one occasion was full but a second shuttle quickly arrived. The only down side to the hotel for us was that people could smoke everywhere which we found a little annoying as we're used to smoke free environments these days. However that's the norm in Marrakech and it wasn't that bad. Overall a lovely mini break in the sun with the Hotel Kenzi really adding to the enjoyment.

The restaurant staff was plentiful but seemed disinterested in serving the guests. However the front desk staff and bellmen were very helpful with great personalities.

So what is the but? Even taking into account the quality of the hotel we thought that the prices for drinks and food (we did not go all inclusive) were exceptionally high - equal to similar quality in London's West End.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Shellems wrote a review Nov 2013,50,EXCELLENT BASE FOR MARRAKECH VISIT,We stayed here end of October beginning of November 2013 and really enjoyed our stay. I don't understand some of the negative comments regarding staff and can only surmise you get out what you put in.  I have stayed at a hotel before where the staff in the restaurant were really bad and the Kenzi is nothing like that. the staff were helpful friendly without being pushy or obtrusive.  Yes you do have to tip but this is the norm for Morrocco and most hotels.    We walked into the centre and square from the hotel with a 4 yr old and had a lovely walk although it took 40 mins just taking our time. Most of the walk was through a garden being developed behind the hotel which was lovely - great views and fountains.    There is also a shopping mall behind the hotel 2 mins walk away with a food court with lots of brands pizza hut dominos etc so loads of choice for food if kids want pizza for a change.  every where was very safe and even with a 4 yr old and 12 yr old no issues at all.    The one exception which has also been commented on previously on trip advisor is the cashier. She (female) was very dishonest - she tried to rip us off when exchanging money until my husband asked for a calculator then she tried to cover up - apparently this is not the first time this has happened. This is a shame as it gives distrust and the hotel should really do something about this in terms of training staff and making it clear this ruins the reputation of the hotel with 1 small act. This woman brings the reputation of other staff into question which is not fair on them.    One other thing which needs addressing and needs to be made more clear is that when you book it is not necessarily all inclusive as the title of the hotel is misleading and is not in fact the name. The hotel name is 'Kenzi Menara Palace signature' and not 'all inclusive premium ' this leads to a false expectation.  The price is actually very good for what it is so why spoil the experience and put themselves in a difficult position from the start by having the guest believe they have booked all inclusive when they have not.    The facilities were very good and we certainly other than the cashier experienced none of the difficulties reported on trip advisor with the staff. we would stay again for sure and plan to bring the family with us.    .,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shellems
Kenzi Menara Palace,Marina M wrote a review Oct 2013,50,Great Hotel,Just before departing for Marrakesh I read some of the latest reviews on tripadvisor and was worried that we were going to have a testing time at the Kenzi Menara. Never further from the truth. We used our transfer day from Medina based Riad to out of town hotel the Kenzi to take a trip into the High Atlas and arrived rather hot and dusty execting a lenghty check in. Not at all. We were immediately sat in comfortable chairs and our check in was very swift and easy with all details listed in our booking observed.  During our three nights at the hotel we utilised room service which was a little slow but the food was superb. We spend time around the pool which is immense with the most comfortable loungers and enjoyed lunch at the pool bar. The breakfast buffet each morning was fantastic with excellent service on served hot drinks. We dined one evening at the traditional Moroccan restaurant which was first class and ended a couple of evenings with a coffee from the main bar. We also used the free shuttle into the medina. All excellent.    All staff were courteous friendly and helpful (bar the total jobsworth I encountered at check out but don't think his attitude should spoil all the hard work undertaken by his colleagues). The concierge team were excellent nothing was too much bother and every question answered.    The room was large with excellent facilities and don't miss a stroll around the garden which is planted with palms flowers and pomegranates - quite wonderful.    I am quite happily recommending this hotel as an excellent out of town base for couples friends and families. Like us it is great twinned with a few days in a Riad first so that you can enjoy both 'living' in Marrakech and then winding down with a few days at the Kenzi for rest and relaxation.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marinam552
Kenzi Menara Palace,RobBristol wrote a review Oct 2013,40,Very relaxing out of town hotel,Nice place to stay if you want a modern hotel within a few minutes of the centre. It was 15 mins from the airport (200dr for a car to pick you up for hotel) and about 10 from the medina (on the free shuttle bus). Large pool and plenty of sunbeds around with pool bar 3 restaurants to choose from spacious reception and bar area with large rooms (ours looked on to garden & pool with terrace). Staff were mainly friendly and helpful but sometimes their usual demeanour is just not the same as you might find in UK or US... So don't take it personally! We were on B&B rate and therefore found the restaurants very expensive outside of that but it's because you are on a complex out of town and pretty much a captive audience. The restaurant in hotel next door (crystal) was lovely but even pricier! If you want to eat cheaply then head into medina centre. Petit Taxi home the night we did that was 50dr. There is a carrefour supermarket fairly near if you wanted to get some bits and pieces if you were there for a week or more. Beds were very comfy room was clean and they provided mineral water every day in the room. Would go again but check your patio doors close ok if on ground floor - mine was a bit ropey but I felt safe enough on the complex anyway and there was a safe in the room.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Horfield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobBristol

We emailed several times and even phoned to arrange a transfer from the airport as we were arriving in the evening with children... no one came. We phoned on arrival and had to wait 15 mins for a very rickety minibus. Then we had a VERY long wait at reception for our rooms which we had again emailed and phoned ahead to arrange as we wanted adjoining rooms for our children. We had been very obviously lost in the system but there was no gushing apology and no hot towels as we had been offered last time.  The lovely pool we had admired on our first visit had been poorly maintained and was freezing cold. The paint had flaked off and it all looked quite tatty.  The international restaurant meal we had the first night convinced us to avoid dining in the hotel at all costs. Breakfasts were swift to be cleared away causing several diners to miss it.  The hotel shop was astonishingly expensive.  We had only brought hand luggage and needed to buy sun cream - it was bog standard stuff and £24 a bottle!

However when it came to asking for a glass of Ice they were rapid quick in getting a BUCKET of the stuff to me;  I sometimes felt as if the staff & concierge just wanted to get rid of us. When my girlfriend dashed in and asked as a matter of urgency for change to pay a taxi we she was told no-one could help which led to a very helpful gentleman changing it for us;  the Bar food was average at best. The chips were caked in salt and my girlfriends pizza was floating in oil. suffice to say we didn't eat lunch there again;  We weren't informed about the city & tourist tax until we were settling up our room service bill    A great holiday but the hotel could have been better,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rourkie82
Kenzi Menara Palace,Kara46 wrote a review Oct 2013,30,Average at best,Nothing about this hotel screamed 5 stars. The service was average breakfast buffet was the same everyday and pool bar food was awful. We didn't eat dinner or lunch at the hotel based on the tasteless burger and greasy pizza we had on our first day at the pool side bar.    We converted our GBP into Dirhams at M&S in the UK but realised whilst in a taxi to the hotel that we had been given the AED dirhams and not Moroccan dirhams as requested. We asked reception if they could convert the currency but they said they had ran out of dirhams (hard to believe). I felt I had to beg her to change one AED note so that if could pay the taxi. She obliged after much persuasion.    My partner noticed a few guests had been provided with bedroom slippers. He requested 2 pairs and was told they'd be sent up to our rooms but they didn't arrive!    Excursions are over priced so consider booking them privately and not via the hotel.    What we appreciated:  The spa - we didn't have a massage but used the jacuzzi in the evenings once the sun had set.  Free shuttle service to the medina - this ran frequently and on time until 7pm.  Taxis readily available throughout the day should you miss the shuttle bus or need to head away from the medina but be sure to negotiate your fare beforehand.  Spacious rooms with comfortable beds.  A selection of movies for all ages  Location - equidistance from the medina and airport.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kara46
Kenzi Menara Palace,SMills86 wrote a review Oct 2013,50,Fantastic hotel and great value for money,Having read the reviews on Trip Advisor prior to booking our stay I honestly cannot believe how people can make such negative comments about the staff and the furnishings. The staff were extremely attentive friendly and helpful. The room furnishings and facilities were of a very high standard; exactly what you'd expect of a 5* hotel. I cannot recommend the hotel enough to anyone wanting a luxurious relaxing stay in Marrakech. Every morning you have the option of fresh omlettes or pancakes cooked in front of you whilst you wait along with the usual continental breakfast buffet which has a variety of options to suit all tastes. The pool is huge and clean with a separate shallow area for children to play in.    The only negative comment i can make is that the WIFI was a bit hit and miss however with a hotel the size of Kenzi Menara Palace (and it is the size of a palace) it is unlikely that you would be able to find a router able to cover such a vast area.    We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Kenzi Menara Palace and would certainly stay there again should we visit Marrakech in the future.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Sheffield, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMills86

Food was very limited selection in the restaurant. However breakfast Buffett was excellent. Drinks really really expensive..

Kenzi Menara Palace,Gilbert O wrote a review Sep 2013,30,5 Star Room 2 Star Staff 3 Star Meals,"You could be literally anywhere in the world within this compound. Nice Rooms Good Food and a remarkable average at best staff. The Hotel gives no real feel of Morocco other than some architecture but if you are just looking for fun in the sun then it is probably right for you.    Check-In was a nightmare. The process is very strange. I have stayed in 5 Star resorts on most continents and the check in usually begins with: hello sir what is your name a look up of the reservation a confirmation of the duration of the stay the exchange of a credit card and then a quiet un-eventful stay and usually no need to ""officially"" check out. We were told to sit (on a comfy couch) thinking alright this will be easy but I had to nearly beg the woman to take my name down and or confirm my reservation through expedia she then attempted to pre-authorize my card without stating any amount or anything and without confirming that I did indeed have a reservation. Finally I said We have all inclusive I will pay for my room now and this will be done.    The food and drink was very solid. Pool Bar Mojitos were great. All inclusive food was very very solid. Anyone complaining was probably expecting gordon ramsay to deliver their meal. Its solid resort food nothing more or less. Amazing desserts. Decent wine.    Generally with a few exception the staff was terrible. As others have said if you have all inclusive they basically ignore you and treat you as a second class citizen though you have paid 150 dollars more than normal guests for the privilege. They want tips they want fancy orders and they don't want to serve you even the simplest of requests if you have the ""all inclusive"" wrist band. If you think you are special maybe tip every single person when you get there if you don't want the same experience.    Check out they attempted to tell me the room hadn't been paid and then were shocked to find a credit card terminal receipt issued just the day before in their lobby. After scurrying around they admitted fault and off I went.    Organization. Zero.    I would say if you want to get sun eat too much solid food drink too much standard liquor and not really experience the culture of Morocco that this place is a best bet and away from all the craziness of the actual city. There are free shuttles into the city so if you are looking to escape and see the city by day that would work too.    Room was Great.

Yes they have lovely large rooms they have a pool and a spa but the service is terrible!!  The concierge were great i would say the best staff of the hotel and they did so much to help. But the rest of that staff at the hotel were hopeless!Its would take 30 minutes to receive a towel and cushion for the chairs at the pool. We ordered ice cream and a Creme Brulee from room service which took an hour and when they did show up they forgot the ice cream the food was tasty however. And the reception staff were always moody and unwilling to help. We asked them if they would contact a restaurant to make a booking for us and they just told us to ring from our room.    Big warning!!!! The cashier also tried to give us less money when doing a currency exchange. He didn't count out the money to us so when i check it i informed him of his mistake he then tried to say he gave me the right amount he kept saying he got it right but eventually gave in and gave me the extra 100MAD that he left out. We also went to the bar to get a bottle of water the girl serving asked us for 30 MAD in cash to which i said no put it on our room tab when i received the receipt it showed that water was only 20MAD. I would advise to always get things added to your room and settle at the end as you don't always know the prices for things so they will more than likely ask you for more money than it costs.    There are some positives for this hotel it's beautiful and clean and lovely large rooms but a hotel stay is suppose to be relaxing and it certainly was not when the staff are trying yo rip you off. The swimming pool is amazing and the gardens are beautiful!The Concierge and Spa staff are great they were very friendly. I would definitely recommend trying the Hammam which is like a sauna. The food is lovely from what we had breakfast and room service. There is a wide range of food at Breakfast from fresh fruits to cooked breakfast to fresh pancakes and pastries to olive cheeses and hams.  However if you do go down to breakfast at 7am when it starts they are usually not set up yet its best to go down after 8am.  They run a shuttle service between the hotel and Jemma el fna square which is also good as its free. Although the first shuttle was at 10am and the last shuttle is at 7pm would be nice if they started earlier and finished later as the food stalls in the square don't open till 6pm in the evening and would be nice to catch a shuttle back later.    I would have to say i probably would not recommend this hotel as for the money i think there are better hotels in marrakech.,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Natalia8910
Kenzi Menara Palace,Cat242 wrote a review Sep 2013,30,Over-stated at 5* but a good base to mix exploring & relaxing,"I think that most good reviews come when a hotel surpasses expectations with this hotel promising 5 star all inclusive accomodation it would have to go some way to deserve a rave review. What it did well was the pool and land scaping lovely gardens and a huge pool with plenty of comfy sunbeds. The rooms were fine too nice big beds and lots of storage to spread out.  We booked based on the ""all inclusive"" name of the hotel however we were actually only B&B luckily we discovered this before we got there so no nasty bills but a bit of a sneaky trick that seems to be by the hotel not expedia. The breakfast was fine there was enough choice for the few days we stayed but it certianly wasn't five star food. We didn't eat in the hotel other than at breakfast. The concierge recommended a lovely Italian restaurant in the new town so I would say to listen to their suggestions for food. They also arranged a trip to the Atlas Mountains which was good but the advice that we would be taking a 20 minute walk and would be ok in flip flops was a little wide of the mark! Prepare to climb over rocks and also to pay a separate guide on top of your driver (we thought the initial price seemed a bit too good to be true.) Also prepare to barter in the women's co-op they take you to on the way up we were well into bartering in the souks but were a bit too generous in their shop!  Overall this was a good location for a group of girls wanting to experience the buzz of Marrakech over a slightly longer period of time so as to fit in a bit of rest and sun bathing. As we wanted to eat out every day it was fine that we weren't all inclusive as we first thought we just thought drinks round the pool may have been good but no one seemed to mind that we took our own.  One day I would love to go to a 5 star hotel that was 5 star in every way this was not the place to deliver that.",Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cat242

On the day we used our Hamam pass a male cleaner saw my friend and I go into the Hamam steam room. Later a man came in in shorts (boxers I think) and flip flops and said he was there to give us a massage. I won't go into details but he was a cleaner posing as a Masseuse. He abused his position and totally pushed his luck.    I was helped by my friend and upon trying to explain what happened to the Spa manager who clearly didn't believe me we spotted the cleaner back in his cleaning uniform innocently mopping the floors around the pool. I explained this was the man I was talking about.    Concierge (very good english) talked me out of calling the police. The hotel Preseident talked me out of it too. I left there with a free meal and massage and manicure as compensation. Later after writing a letter to complain I was offered two free nights for two full board. But to be honest.... I don't want to go back.

NOw this will scare you in the sense of hotel policies dealing with lost or robbed suitcases.    We arrived a group of six friends with 6suitcases 3 big and 3 smaller ones when we arrived. It was about 9am the hotel staff came to the entrance and carried ALL our suitcases in the metal carrier and the carrier was left opposite the reception area. After 3 hours the rooms were ready and we proceeded to the baggage area and we noticed that one of the cases was missing it was highlighted to the hotel staff and they tried to search for it T he hotel staff said that it must have been left behind the taxi we knew it was not true as 2 persons of the group had counted them on arrival to the hotel.    This happened on Friday13th the conserve told us to leave the problem in his hands as he would go to the AIrportand ask the taxi we insisted that the baggage had ALL arrived at the hotel. But he insisted. I asked on the following day as the suitcase had not been found for the hotel to give me a letter for me to take to the insurance company back at home he said that the hotel would not give me the letter because lost baggage was not heard off in this hotel.    On S unsay I asked if he could. Take me to the police station  so as to report the loss of the suitcase and if possible a registered letter stamped and official for me to take to the insurance company he said that his friend the commissar did not work on S un days and that the best bet is to try on Monday    The following day Monday we were taken to the police station and after a wait of 3hours we were given the letter the inspector commented to me in broken English that this happened on Friday and I had come to the police station on the Monday?????.....

Kenzi Menara Palace,Kim Y wrote a review Aug 2013,10,Worst Hotel ever,I recently had a 4 day mini holiday for my 1 year wedding anniversary in Marrakech. My husband was due to book the Sofitel Hotel which we later found out was much better than the Kenzi Palace. The only reason he booked this one was because it stated in the title 'All Inclusive Preminum' we later found out that this is merely a way to attract customers as it is not infact an all inclusive deal you are getting. When we tried to explain this to the receiptionist - lady with glasses and fringe called Siloua who was very arrogant and rude and unwilling to help infact looked like she couldnt care less she had alot of attitude on her. My husband and i had just got there and not even checked in and already i hated the holiday i had waited for 1 year for.  Next... we spoke to the manager who gave us a complimentry voucher for dinner for our first night for the inconveinice we had experience the dinner was shocking and so dry.. we thought in the end it was a blessing in distgusie that we didnt get all inclusive as the food was horrible. the entertainment was scary a bunch of men banging their drums and shouting something while you are eating you cant hear yourself think.    everyone is only interested in money here.. dont be fooled..  we asked for towels in our room and got accused of stealing them as the cleaners claim they couldnt find them..    on my 1st day there when i finally checked into my room there was a cockroach in the shower.. people can barely speak english so couldnt understand what i was saying.    2nd day another cockroach so the holiday wasnt going great.. We eventually got upgraded to a suite but not a pool view even tho we asked for this.. it was our 1st anniversary and i was having a horrile time.    the air conditioning in the hotel isnt great we were there when it was 45 degrees and i couldnt even sit in the sun.. when we asked the staff to put the air con on they made funny faces and reluctantly done it so low that you cant feel it.    some staff were nice there was a lovely pretty lady behind the bar who gave me some special tea when i had an upset stomach and sherrif at concierge was a nice guy who spoke english too so really helpful.    be prepared to be lumbered with a tax bill at the end of your stay aswell which they do not warn you about when you check in..

Overall I would say you're looking at a glorified Butlins...which is fine if that is what you want....and to be fair we had a massive air conditioned room that easily housed our family of 4 (two teenage kids)......and apart from the fact that the curtains were hanging off the rail with only about three curtain rings the room was fine......and to be honest for four adults was very good value.  it might be unfair but THANK GOODNESS WE WERE ROOM ONLY...I looked at the buffet and the 'entertainment' and it looked simply awful....and at €28/head (which may or may not include wine...I suspect not!) I was so happy to be able to eat out. (especially as the hotel restaurants appeared to be not air-conditioned).  DO NOT TRUST THE CONCIERGES....they are simply at the front of the queue of people trying to rip you off. They told us it was a taxi ride to the shopping centre that you can actually see from reception...we realised that if you walk out of the back gate of the hotel it is no more than four minutes walk. I also asked them to book me a table in the restaurant PepeNero which is reputedly one of the best restaurants in Marrakech....and they told me it was closed......a bit odd for a restaurant in Morocco to close in the holiday season....especially one that only caters to tourists......so I called the restaurant myself....very much not closed!...(and the most fantastic restaurant if you are looking for a decent place to eat ....€145 for a family of four...3 courses plus wine). We also asked the concierge how much we should pay a taxi to take us to Yves St Laurent's garden (one of the main attractions in Marrakech) and he said he didn't know!!!...handy!...although you can be sure the driver will charge you €5.00 more than the concierge says anyway.  Just when I thought that maybe the hotel wasn't that bad....I saw my bill and they had charged me for the sachet of instant coffee which they left by the coffee making facility in the room.

They did inform us we would get a pool view suite upon our return after 2 nights in the Palm Plaza. The receptionist couldn't speak very good English so we were pretty stuck with our options.    I'd spent lots of time researching the Kenzi Menara and this was the hotel I had chosen so was really upset we couldn't start our holiday here.    We got given full board at the Palm Plaza as opposed to B&B at the Kenzi Menara but the food was dreadful. We were told 3 restaurants were available for dinner but only 1 was the buffet. We had difficulty trying to communicate with all staff as hardly any of them could understand our English. The atmosphere was terrible the food and drinks were terrible so we were very pleased to leave after two nights.    We got picked up by Cheriff from the Kenzi Menara and what a wonderful man he is! He cracked jokes and told us all the best places to eat and drink he really does make the hotel!    We got given a premium suite with a garden view not a pool view as promised but by this point I couldn't be bothered to argue anymore and just wanted to enjoy the holiday. But my the room was fabulous! A huge basket of fruits awaited us and a plate full of cakes a huge lounge area two balconys two bathrooms and a huge bed the room was gorgeous so we didn't mind the garden (road view) so much!    The pool area was very spacious and the staff very attentive. The restaurants were lovely and the cocktails were a bit more well presented here than at the Palm Plaza. Breakfasts were good with fresh eggs and pancakes cooked whilst you wait.    We also got a full body massage at the spa which was very good however the gym didn't seem to have any air con and was far too hot for me to work out in which was disappointing.    The shuttle service was very good and one time actually dropped us in the new town as a special request.    Be prepared to haggle with every taxi driver usually we got down 50% of their first quote so be prepared to walk away if they're not willing to accommodate. Most places in Marrakech you can get to with 40/50 Dirhams from the hotel except the airport is 100 dirhams.    Ask Cheriff for places to eat and drink or things to do he is very very helpful with great English. We were very grateful for his service!

Kenzi Menara Palace,KTForrester wrote a review Jun 2013,40,Luxurious stay,My partner and i had an amazing stay at the Kenzi Menara. The hotel is sumptuously fitted out with striking fabricsartwork and pretty lighting. It provides a tranquil gettaway perfect for a romantic trip for two. The staff went the extra mile to make our stay special especially the day time concierge who arranged some fantastic trips for us and the friendly front of house at the breakfast buffet who always started our day with a big smile. The pool is massive so there's no scrambling to the poolside at the crack of dawn to get a bed there is more than enough to go round. My reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is we would have liked little more entertainment if we hadnt have asked the concierge where to go we'd have had no idea as there are no flyers/leaflets to advertise trips etc and apart from a lounge bar singer there wasnt much to keep us entertained in the evenings at the kenzi menara. We tried the traditional Moroccan restaurant one night with in the hotel and were very disappointed by the food it was very bland. The service however excellent but if you want tasty Moroccan food eat where the locals eat not the tourists! The hotel is in an up and coming area so i feel in the next few year it will be a prime spot. If you are happy to use taxis and the free shuttle bus though the location really isnt a problem. The prices of drinks however are Its about 120 dirhams for a cocktail! We ended up buying booze and bottled water from a supermarket but its what we expected as the hotel is 5 star so its only right to expect 5 star prices! Another bonus to kenzi menara is its owned by the same owner as Pacha (5 minute walk away!) so we got free entry! What more could we ask for we will definitely return!

The restaurants were quite nice again pretty expensive and actually we preferred the simpler but more generous Moroccan food we had elsewhere. Breakfast was fairly good.    Service in general was mixed - everything was over-staffed with very attentive staff but they sometimes got the wrong end of the stick (then again we were English-speakers in a French-speaking tourist industry). The concierge in particular was really friend and helpful and organised some great trips for us but was also definitely a bit of a hustler - difficult to tell how much commission he was making on everything! Other staff definitely went the extra mile from the housekeeping guy who lent us his own phone charger to the waitress who served us food and wine near the pool long after the kitchen was supposed to have closed.    Overall recommended but make sure you get a good deal - it's not cheap.,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SimonM746
Kenzi Menara Palace,Dipum P wrote a review Jun 2013,30,No where near 5 star service,I am always as a honest as I can be in my reviews so having just come back from Marrakech this one I felt had to be made.  Firstly the positive points The hotel property rooms and facilities are very nice and I agree this part warrants a five star. In addition to this the location is great with most points of interest a short taxi ride away.  Now for the important service and I await for the managements comments on this In my view the hotel owners have the such a great job with location and decor of this property however the lack of attentiveness and customer service from most of your staff needs to be addressed and corrected immediately.  Just a couple of points.. Firstly the pool side staff had to be asked on average 4 times before any action for beverages towels etc.  I asked for an Iron was told it was on its way then told an hour later that there was no irons available as they we all being used by other guests then had sent shirts to be pressed and had stressed to the staff that I was running late and needed them back urgently which in turn I was surprise to be told that they would only take 5 minutes. 1 and a half hours later and after 4 calls to the management shirts turned up.  On the fair side we were compensated with our incidentals taken off the bill by management but this hotel could be and should be a far lot better but unfortunately the staff let this down.,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dip1979
Kenzi Menara Palace,BouBou I wrote a review Jun 2013,30,Could be much better,Stayed there couple of nights with my wife for the WE. We didnt leave the hotel at all.    1st mistake: at our arrival we had to prove that we are married (of course everyone travels with his wedding certificate). As a matter of fact we had it so they made a copy right away.    2nd mistake: the staff at the reception didn't seem to understand clearly the all-inclusive offer and what it contained or not and the hours. They need to be seriously trained on the subject.  Of course I asked a copy of that all inclusive paper they only had 1 copy and told us that the xerox machine was too far away from the reception. But they managed to make a copy for the wedding certificate though... anyway. Classic stuff from moroccan staff...    Room was big and nice bed was really comfy and pretty bathrooms. Fridge was fully filled and apples on the table. Efficient room.  Room service was very slow we had to wait 1 hour for 1 soup and 1 club sandwich.  Pool is actually really great you really have to come early to pick your spot otherwise... Meh... Pool bathrooms are a real mess they should have somebody clean it on a frequent basis.    Food was a major disappointment nothing really exciting: quality was not met. I mean it food was not that good even moroccan tagines and pancakes were bad.    So to sum up a very expensive hotel for what it provides not a palace at all as it doesnt have the luxury codes for a palace or even a 5 stars hotel.  understaffed and slow service.  but friendly staff and weather saved the week end.    3 stars. If it was rated as a 4 stars I'd give it 4 stars but I expected too much I guess,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BouBouI_13
Kenzi Menara Palace,Alyssa wrote a review May 2013,40,Traditional comfort and convenience,Stayed here for four nights as a couple. We were very impressed with the hotel's attentive staff. The decor was a lovely mixture of traditional Moroccan and modern design and the room was large and spacious. We had a room with a pool view balcony which was a lovely touch. The concierge service was convenient and efficient in helping us choose activities and local restaurants. The pool area was relaxing and very large and overall we found the resort grounds pleasant. We felt the spa was lacking a few resources- aside from the treatment rooms there was one pool. We had a relaxing hammam treatment there. The breakfast left a little to be desired although there was a great egg counter every morning. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel for its reasonable price and comfortable facilities,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alyssa155
Kenzi Menara Palace,DiamondCut wrote a review May 2013,50,Great choice - go ahead and book!,Just returned from a 2 night stay at the Kenzi Menara Palace and found it to be great for the following reasons:  a) large well decorated rooms with complimentary bottles of water daily and free movies hollywood if you like that sort of thing  b) only 15 minutes to the medina and the hotel provide a free shuttle bus service (drop off and collection).  c) walking distance (7 minutes) from the Crystal restaurant which has great service and tremendous food.  d) large pool with plenty of poolside seating and umbrellas which you'll need to shade you from the mid-day heat.  e) a decent gym for a hotel (compared to most and i've stayed in a lot of hotels around the world)  f) all english speaking staff and a very helpful head concierge    i was a little unsure about booking this hotel initially as it does not appear very high up on Trip Advisor but i would definately stay there again if visiting Marrakech.,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DiamondCut
Kenzi Menara Palace,Hotel I wrote a review Apr 2013,30,Many disappointing aspects,We were impressed by the following aspects of this spacious hotel: room and terrace size - very good: pool huge and never crowded.    However we were distinctly unimpressed by the brusque unfriendly receptionists particularly a lady wearing glasses. Then when we checked out the man who dealt with us didn't even ask if we had enjoyed our stay and didn't say 'goodbye have a good journey'!! The staff can be quite abrupt and surly also in the bar.    Apart from the buffet breakfast the food is poor. Expect lots of bone and very little meat in the Moroccan restaurant and expect a very limited main course menu in the other restaurant; there are no sauces to accompany the meat or fish dishes and when I asked to provide a sauce for my meat the lady behind the counter was very surly about it. She slung open a cupboard got a box of powdered stock out and slammed it into a pan for two mins - not very warm then!    The service around the pool for drinks etc is non-existent; you have to walk over to the bar every time. And we saw a very unpleasant incident happening to our friends there; they had ordered some food which every day to that point had been delivered to their sun-bed table and the man at the bar refused to deliver the food. He was very very rude to our friends. The manager came to deal with him and even then the man would not deliver the meal! He also threw the pen and the bill across the counter to be signed. Really horrible.    The Spa is not good. I had two treatments there and it was very much a case of 'wham bam thank you ma'am'. No finesse very basic approach. There is also a very unpleasant sewage smell assailing one's nostrils on the approach to the door. Sewage smells also haunted our toilet. We reported this issue but no change after a cursory visit and promise of outdoor investigations.    The pillows are very lumpy and uncomfortable. After many language issues we had them replaced - but the new ones were just as bad!    Our room was not cleaned throroughly I had to speak to the cleaners as the floors were not swept for three days and the wash basin plug-holes were grimy.    One final problem which plagued our trip; the staff speak very little English. If you need an extra pillow or some room service expect to find communication difficult. If this hotel wants to attract international clientelle this language issue has to be addressed.,Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Perth, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HotelI756

Kenzi Menara Palace,Jennifer J wrote a review Apr 2013,40,"Excellent service, huge beautiful rooms, Spa needs work",My family stayed here for a week on holiday. About a 15 minute taxi ride from the Medina. Our friends stayed at a Riad in the center of the action. Which was noisy at night and a little dicey after hours with kids. We were glad we stayed out of the action but close to everything.    Our two teen girls had a huge room of their own and they said it was the best room they ever stayed in! Huge comfy beds huge bathroom with shower and tub. Hubby and I splurged for a suite and it was amazing. Pool view with patio. The living room was huge had another family over for the evening and it was so nice to entertain.    TV has tons of free movies you can select start and actually forward if you have to interrupt. Huge beds. Great bathroom with double sinks tub and shower.    Free breakfast buffet with Moroccan and European specialities but also omelets and scrambled eggs for Americans. We only ate at the buffet for dinner but it was great if at 30$ a person expensive. There were two other restaurants but with so many great ones in Marrakech we only stayed in one night. Room service and pool menu adequate but limited.    Consierge was amazing to set up quad bike adventure dinner show taxis and tours. All staff speaks French but enough speak English. Staff were all friendly professional and accommodating.    Amazing pool with staff and pool bar and restaurant.    Only issue was Spa. Worst mani pedi ever by nicest gal. Staff needs training and if they want to market as a luxury spa needs upgrading. My facial was borderline. Shampoo and blow out fine. Hubby's massage was great.    Overall we were very happy. But I would probably not stay here again because I do like spa services on a holiday.,Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Naples, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/569JenniferS
Kenzi Menara Palace,Mr and Mrs L wrote a review Apr 2013,40,Almost Perfect,We have just come back from an 8 night stay at this beautiful hotel which we booked via secret escapes. We were welcomed at the airport by a lovely man and arrived at the hotel greeted with mint tea and a very helpful reception. The room was great large and very clean with amazing views of the Atlas Mountains and the enormous pool.    The positives to the stay were:    1) The hotel and scenery are beautiful and relaxing  2) Maria and Mike in the evenings were exceptional singers and great hosts  3) Adhil works at the hotel as Leisure Manager and is extremely friendly helpful and an asset to the hotel  4) We really enjoyed the food and atmosphere in the Morocco Restaurant the head chef Nicolahas the kitchens running extremely efficiently serving excellent food  5) The shuttle bus to the square is really helpful and always on time    Negatives would be the service at breakfast. We were often left without tea/coffee plus the language barrier can be an issue if you don't speak French.    Overall we had a lovely time and would go back. We think the lack of service from the waiters etc is purely down to there being a lot of people to cater for at one time.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CBaillie
Kenzi Menara Palace,Freya2007 wrote a review Apr 2013,30,"Great rooms, reception staff need to improve",Spent four nights at hotel whilst visiting Marrakech hotel setting is excellent and rooms are a good size and comfortable. It was a shame that reception staff did not show any interest when checking in and because there is no information in the rooms you had to guess what facilities there were available. Shuttle bus into town good and only takes 10 mins and pick ups are on time. We also arranged a trip to Atlas Mts at 800 Di. This is not worth it as you could hire a cab for half the price and you need to hire an additional guide once there anyway. Top tip in Marrakech is argue the price of everything taxis back to hotel were half the price by the end of our trip and we had got used to arguing price.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Chalford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Freya2007
Kenzi Menara Palace,CirrusHGG wrote a review Mar 2013,20,Palace by name and not service,Booked via secret escapes. Arrival was the best part of the stay with the nice welcome by the porter. Room was nice and spacious with good views.    The reception at checkin was like a factory - hurried impersonal and provided no information about the hotel services. The package included a spa voucher but this was not provided at checkin which meant running around to collect the voucher when we tried to book the spa session.    The spa appears to operate independently to the hotel and hence we had to chase the voucher by ourselves. Our worst hammam experience ever!! At first we were left waiting in a hammam with our dressing gowns! Then with no steam in the hammam we went back and forth to spa reception 3 times only to be told there's a technical problem. It would have been nice to have been told this 20mins earlier as it appeared that the staff already knew about the problem from the outset. The replacement hammam room wasn't great. Took 20mins to half fill with steam with only a 30min session. There were no salts in the hammam like we have previously experienced. All in all a not relaxing treatment.    At dinner we discovered that the a la carte restaurant was fully booked up! If we had been informed during checkin that reservations were necessary then we would have done so! The buffet restaurant was full of tour groups making it feel like a noisy canteen.    Eventually ordered room service which was actually quite a nice meal.    During the evening we found that the room aircon was not working. The handyman came to investigate while we were having dinner. We asked him to come back in half an hour but he never turned up! We were too fed up to chase yet another hotel person.    Checkout was the same as checkin. Never asked if we had a good stay otherwise we would have mentioned the above at that time!

Kenzi Menara Palace,Melanie W wrote a review Mar 2013,40,"Overall very good, but could improve a few things",Stayed for 3 nights As part of a Voyage Prive offer and was pleasantly surprised at size and scale of hotel. Very impressive layout and facilities. Initially only had 2 comments to make 1. No coffee or tea making facilities in the room. With such a nice balcony it was a shame that you couldn't have a relaxing coffee on waking up. 2. Wi - fi was laborious to setup and also slow.  But then the last day arrived and although we had an 8 pm flight we were not offered to extend our room until 5 as hotel too busy. Offered the spa to shower a d get changed which was inconvienient. Then went back to get our cases(at secure location) actually at one side of entrance doors with access from garden ( so not so secure) and the plate we had purchased had been smashed. Sharif the excellent concierge has promised to find a replacement and DHL it too us. Other staff were not bothered.

Kenzi Menara Palace,David B wrote a review Mar 2013,20,All that glisters is not gold,To quote Shakespeare in the Merchant of Venice 'all that glisters is not gold' and the Kenzi Menara Palace hotel is not gold in spite of it's supposedly five star rating.  We had requested that were were met by a car at the airport no car was there. We had to call the hotel several times before we decided to take a taxi there. On arrival the hotel looks impressive with a vast public reception area. We were upgraded to a suite which was quite pleasant with a view over the pool and garden.  Breakfast was chaotic. Waiters carrying empty trays moved between the tables carefully ignoring requests for a cup of coffee and when we eventually managed to get one it was almost cold. The selection of food in the breakfast buffet was quite inferior for this standard of hotel.  We decided to dine in the hotel one evening. There was a choice between a distinctly jaded buffet in the main dining room or traditional cuisine in the Moroccan restaurant. The food here was unbelievably poor and served by a very unsmiling waitress. I complained to the Ali the head waiter who apologised but did not offer anything us anything else. This five star hotel does not have an a la carte restaurant or a coffee shop where one can get a hot coffee outside mealtimes.  The hotel is located some considerable distance from the city centre. The hotel runs a bus  service to the main square but it runs very infrequently and unless you are prepared to wait the alternative is an expensive taxi ride.  We complained to the manager Rene Baiada about the hotel's shortcomings including the failure to send the booked car to the airport. A deputy manager was called and she stated emphatically that we had not confirmed the booking. Fortunately we were able to produce the email confirmation.  Mr Baiada seems to respond to the numerous complaints about the service in the hotel with palliative promises. I advised him to stop wasting his time and to set about dealing directly with the numerous complaints.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Lucca, Italy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidB382

Free shuttle bus to town was great.  The free choice of movies on the TV was a pleasant surprise; after a hard day by the pool and a fabulous evening meal it was nice to laze in the room watching modern films in English.  The only concern is that they clean their floors EVERY day and when in flip-flops the marble surfaces were sometimes slippery.

I felt that the staff could have done more to prevent guests from being exploited here. The average taxi fare to the medina should be 60-70 Dirhams. We were charged from 80-150 and the only time we got the correct fare was when we visited Pepe Nero restaurant whose staff couldn't believe what had happened and ensured our return was at the correct rate (one of the best restaurants in town also try it)    All in all you won't be disappointed by your stay here drinks and food a bit pricey but then the trade off is that your fellow guests know how to conduct themselves.

Kenzi Menara Palace,NilsSpain wrote a review Mar 2013,40,Great hotel for a Marrakech getaway,"My wife and me spent a long weekend (4 nights) at the Kenzi Menara Palace at the end of January. The hotel in general and in particular the rooms are very spacious. With the winter discounts of up to more than 50% off the regular rates the hotel is quite a good deal and I would say it's ideal to use as a base for exploring the city of Marrakech. Most attractions of Marrakech are within a 10-15 minute taxi ride and the taxi fares to the city centre could normally be negotiated to about 5 euros (50-60 MAD). The handicap-adapted room we had was very well adapted for disabled guests including a foldable wall-mounted seat in the shower. Initially we had some trouble with the room heating but the staff helped us resolve the problem in a reasonable time. The breakfast was very good with a wide selection of hot and cold dishes along with the typical omelets made to order. However the Moroccan restaurant inside the hotel was not very good we much preferred going away from the hotel for lunch and dinner. The free wireless internet was surprisingly good in most of the hotel including our room. The taxi ride from the airport to the hotel was a bit of a rip-off since we were more or less forced by the ""airport taxi-mafia"" to pre-pay 20€ and returning with a local taxi was only half that price.",Date of stay: January 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Collado Mediano, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NilsSpain

I have stayed in hotels all round the world and have never come across such helpful courteous and friendly staff! They smile all the time always greet with a shake of the hand or a wave; very polite indeed. My mother is disabled and as soon as I said that our room wasn't suitable for her we were offered a much more suitable one with mobiliity accessories. The food at this hotel is fabulous plentiful with lots of choice. The musicians in the Moroccan restaurant were very friendly and we had a lot of fun with them and the excellent waiter and the lady singer in the bar has a lovely voice too.    Room service was fast and efficient and all requests were dealt with quickly and efficiently.    The pool area is lovely and the waiter very friendly and accommodating. All public areas are kept clean and bright. The lady in the shop opposite Reception is delightful and very helpful.    We had an amazing oriental massage which was very relaxing and the ladies were very patient and helpful with my mother. The hammam sauna and indoor pool are a nice addition.    We had two trips out organised by Cherif which were excellent with a private guide on the one day who was brilliant at pushing mum's wheelchair around the souk and he was very knowledgeable and entertaining.    The young concierge who took us back to the airport yesterday was wonderful he even went into the airport to fetch me a wheelchair for mum and a porter to take our luggage and asked him to wait in line at check-in until we arrived! He then insisted on wheeling mum into the airport to save me the trouble. What service!    There were a couple of negatives and I do have to agree with another person's comments that it was difficult to get coffee and cutlery in the mornings but the staff were still very polite and helpful. It would also be helpful to have rails near the steps for disabled people and the slopes for wheelchairs are too steep. However the staff were always willing to assist me.    My final comment is that this is a brilliant hotel with wonderful staff who are all dedicated to ensure that visitors have a great experience at their hotel.

Breakfast service was chaotic with insufficient waiting staff on duty - be prepared to ask (repeatedly) for coffee crockery or cutlery from the 2 waiters/1 waitress who have perfected the art of studiously ""looking through"" guests to a fine art. Raise your hand for attention they will catch your gaze nod in acknowledgement then walk off in the opposite direction ...leaving you non-plussed and still waiting - even the intervention of management to assist did nothing to alleviate the frustration of waiting.    Tap water is undrinkable but there's no complimentary water on offer from the room mini-bar    The hotel barman was surly and off-hand (removing olives/nuts from the bar instead of replenishing them) ......almost no-one smiles - why?    But it's not all bad....the hotel location is attractive with the Atlas mountains in the distance the pool and gardens are spacious and the rooms are of generous size.    We found the hotel reception staff polite helpful and courteous and a 3 hour extension to check out time (quoted at 100 dirhams per hour) was not charged.    A pleasant place to stay but please please please get more staff and ask them to react to requests and smile.",Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Preston, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgemU3252OI
Kenzi Menara Palace,Izzy146 wrote a review Feb 2013,50,Wonderful!,I couldn't recommend this hotel highly enough I'm very difficult to please and everything in this hotel was just fantastic. Our room was huge well furnished spotlessly clean and with a lovely balcony overlooking the pool which was fabulous. The pool was beautiful with gorgeous sun loungers and a great poolside bar which served good snacks. The breakfasts were amazing with everything you could wish for and regularly replenished served by attentive and very courteous staff. The staff helped make our stay here very special from the amazing concierge Charif who organised all our trips and made our restaurant reservations offered advice and made everything run smoothly to Adil the Public Relations manager and Fatima on reception who both went out of their way to make sure we were happy with everything and were a pleasure to talk to about our stay and experiences. The spa is also wonderful very relaxing and with a good selection of treatments again with charming staff. Room service was prompt and someone arrived at our room within 5 minutes when our TV didn't work - and fixed it straight away. The hotel is in a good location just 10 minutes from the market square souks and main tourist attractions but located in beautiful gardens well tended with many quiet seating areas. We had a fantastic week and were sorry to leave thanks to everyone at the Kenzi Menara Palace for giving us a holiday to remember.,Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Highley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Izzy146
Kenzi Menara Palace,LlamaEllie wrote a review Feb 2013,50,Highly recommended,We are a couple in our late twenties and we stayed at this hotel for 5 nights in February. We thought it was excellent better than the reviews we read on trip advisor reported. The excellent service particularly stood out. On arrival we were welcomed and shown to our hotel room by a friendly English speaking member of staff who answered any questions we had. Our ground floor room was large clean and spacious with a huge bed bath and separate shower and a big private patio area which was not overlooked by other rooms.  On the first night we eat in the Moroccan restaurant at the hotel. The food was good the decor and service were great and there was a traditional Moroccan band playing. We had a voucher for a free meal as part of our package. The food isn't particularly cheap but is the same add other good restaurants in Marrakesh we found and it was always good size portions and tasty. There is a wide selection at breakfast too with eggs and pancakes made to order.  Outside there is a big pool and plenty of seating to relax on. The hotel wasnt too busy at the time we visited. The weather was perfect in February it was occasionally a little cloudy and cool in the evenings but one day it was clear and 28 degrees so very different to England!  We also had a voucher for a hammam in the spa which was lovely. I upgraded to also have a massage which was really excellent probably the best massage I've ever had.  The hotel offers a free shuttle to Marrakesh a few times a day. We used this to go shopping in Marrakesh - a real experience! Some bargains to be had if you're good at bartering! And we eat in Marrakesh a couple of nights. Its easy and cheap to get taxis to town in the evening. The hotel can order you one if you want it to come to the hotel but it's cheaper to walk onto the street and flag one down.    I would highly recommend this hotel it was a really relaxing break we felt looked after by the excellent and friendly hotel staff. It was a happy medium between pure relaxation and a city break was lovely to be able to relax in the hotel after a day shipping in the souks. We felt as of we got what we paid for with this holiday and would happily come back to this hotel again.,Date of stay: February 2013,,"Scarborough, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LlamaEllie

The staff seemed to have only one thing on their minds and that was your comfort absolutely magnificent. The concierge's name was Sharrif and he was a star with plenty of help and good advice available to all who required it.    The only hiccup from my side was that I thought that the menu was a trifle limited for the quality of the hotel.

Kenzi Menara Palace,FirstTravellerLondon wrote a review Feb 2013,30,"5-star property, 3-star service but good value for money",The hotel is set in a fairy derelict new development area about 10 minutes by car from the airport and 10 minutes from central Marrakech. The hotel provides a free shuttle bus from the hotel to the Medina area of Marrakech at 10:00 12:00 15:00 17:00 and 19:00 with returns from Marrakech fifteen minutes later. Alternatively a taxi from the hotel to the city will cost you anything from DIR 600 to DIR 2000 depending on your haggling skills. The Al Mazar shopping mall (a contender for the most boring shopping mall in the world competition) is within walking distance of the hotel where there is a food court and also a Carrefour supermarket. Next to the mall is the Pacha night club.    The hotel itself is only a few years old with an impressive lobby area a large swimming pool a bar and two restaurants. There is also a spa with a small indoor swimming pool (which is so heavily chlorinated that the fumes makes your eyes water and your lungs hurt). The rooms are large and modern with flat screen TV’s balcony or terrace and a bathroom with both a walk-in shower and tub. The main restaurant has an international menu and whilst the food is not spectacular it is perfectly adequate. It is a shame that at night the restaurant is so brightly lit it lacks any atmosphere; softer lighting and a few candles would make all the difference. The other restaurant which is much smaller serves traditional Moroccan cuisine. Expect to pay DIR 100 for a Gin & Tonic in the bar and around DIR 600 for a two course dinner for two in the restaurant including a bottle of local Moroccan wine.    The hotel claims to be 5-star and we agreed that the property itself is very nice but when it comes to service levels it is a long way off the level the international 5-star hotels in the city provide although to be fair to the hotel so are its prices. The reception staff speaks excellent English and are keen to help but service levels in the bar were non-existent and unless you wave your arms the staff will simply ignore you. There is also no pool side service at all; there is a bar at the end of the pool but the staff are content to stay in the bar and will not walk around the pool to offer any service. The head concierge Charif is worthy of a mention; he speaks very good English and provides good service.    One final observation; no bottled water is provided for the rooms. Considering the advice that one should not drink tap water in Morocco a hotel of this standard should provide daily bottled water to all rooms. Turn-down service is also not provided.    Overall a very nice property that is good value for money as long as you don’t mind staying outside Marrakech and don’t expect international 5-star service.,Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FirstTravellerLondon

Unfortunately the bar closes very early and in particular one of the bar attendant's whose name I think was Hamid was not very friendly and quiet miserable which made our time at the bar feel quite uncomfortable. Hamid please smile a little it goes such a long way! The live singing was good but a little too loud. The pool staff were very attentive and welcoming. Front of house very helpful.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Caroline B wrote a review Jan 2013,50,I'd love to return.,We have just returned after a 3 night stay at this wonderful hotel how I wish it had been longer. We had a fantastic huge room with a double balcony overlooking the pool and the Atlas Mountains. The beds were comfy. The bathroom was huge with a big bath and separate shower. The room was clean and had been well maintained.    The downstairs area of the hotel again is lovely. There are plenty of places to relax in comfort both in the lounges and outside on the terraces.  We had some vouchers for the Spa. This is definitely worth a visit. A massage followed by a swim in the indoor pool. My only gripe is that the water could have been a touch warmer.    What really makes this hotel is the attentiveness and attention of the staff. We felt welcome straight away the check in staff ensured that our first impressions were good. I only wish I'd taken more staff names to complement them personally. The breakfast staff were excellent. They always greeted us asking if we slept well. My coffee cup was never empty an observant member of staff realised I was a coffeeholic and when a big group of conference people were in he gave me the jug in case he couldn't get to me quick enough!  The concierge staff again were excellent and no request was a problem. We were always greeted well and with a smile.    Yes the hotel was away from the Medina but the complementary shuttle service was good and reliable. In fact we appreciated being able to come back after a few hours and enjoy one relaxation without the hustle and bustle. So definitely the best of both worlds.    As mentioned earlier the hotel were hosting a company conference at no point did I feel that our service was compromised as a result.    So yes a fantastic hotel with lovely service from the staff.

Great shuttle service to and from the Medina - makes for a awesome cultural experience. Cherif - the conceirge should be praised as was very helpful knowledgeable and provided very friendly service. He arranged a driver for us and provided advice when needed especially on buying things from the souks. Whenever we had a question - he was happy to answer. The staff overall should be praised - always welcoming at breakfast and even though english was probably their 3rd language always made an effort to speak with us. Had a fabulous Hammam at the Terarke Spa - definitly a must do! The gym ws well equiped and clean - if your into that as well! Great place to explore refresh the mind and body and catch some sun!

The staff are helpful hard working smartly attired and charming bedrooms are very large spotless and comfortable with huge beds very large towels and bathrobes. The pool is huge and has a quick-service snack area. There are some small details that need tweaking but nothing that should stop anyone from choosing this hotel. The décor is not really my taste running to brown and sludge there are some really gloomy areas and corridors there was a light out in the bathroom and we struggled to lock our balcony door possibly because we didn’t realise one side was open the whole time! The shower is very peculiar poking up from a tap position on the bath – but who cares it was a very hot very powerful shower! Garden room is a bit of a misnomer we overlooked a side road but as we were hardly in the room it wasn’t an issue – far more vital was the fact it was perfectly quiet. Service in the dining room could have been a little faster and needs a little tweaking but was mostly impeccable - the food was very good and perhaps we need not to be so impatient! Cherif the concierge is Mr Fixit and courteously arranged whatever we requested.

For anyone visiting the city I would recommend the old town for atmosphere every time but if you do like a large outdoor pool plenty of space and to be able to retreat to some calm away from the centre then maybe this is for you. It's only 10 mins in a cab to the main square. I thought the hotel was nicely laid out although a bit sterile for my liking. Food was ok and the staff were helpful.

We could if we wanted too start to get picky about some small aspects ie there were l areas of maintenance needed in some areas but it appeared that most of these were being addressed some though not all staff were not as attentive but that suited us fine as in some hotels we have stayed at staff have been over attentive.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Mark H wrote a review Nov 2012,40,Kenzi paradise almost lost!,After being told that there had been a computer error and no room was available we got transfered to the inferior Kenzi Club Agdal Medina up the road with an all inclusive wrist band. I felt cheated and unhappy. I went back to the Menara Palace and insisted that we stay where we booked and had expected to be.  The manager on duty (Alid) listened to my concerns and helped me move back to the Kenzi Menara Palace - I still do not know or understand the true reason why they put us through this ordeal (but they did have 3 conferences while we stayed  so that could have been the reason.)  After that first afternoon our stay there was delightful I enjoyed the solitude the peace and quiet by the pool (a million miles away from the other 'club' which is good but not the kind of holiday we wanted.)  The rooms are clean and stylish. comfy / firm beds but pillows are dreadful! There is hot water and both bath and shower. They offer great room service and I found all the staff were hospitable and kind. I did find that the patio doors from our room to the poolside area had a broken lock but as it is an enclosed hotel with security I didn't feel that it was a huge problem.    They offer a great breakfast with lots of variety which I enjoyed every morning.    There is a free shuttle every two hours into the town which drops you right at the heart of Marrakech at Djemaa el Fna - where you are told the pick up times from the driver.    I am a fussy bugger and like everything to be ' just so' this Hotel met ALL my expectations and I truly recommend it - just don't be fooled into staying up the road when they have plenty of rooms available it seems to be a marketing ploy to get you to spend top dollar for 5 star luxury only to be taken to the less than 5 star Kenzi Club Agdal Medina - under the false impression you are getting good value & extras at no cost. It's the same company - the same brand but like so many times in Marrakech you are more than likely being tricked & lied to.    Beware of the TAXI drivers!  I stopped using the local taxis because they try to rip you off and charge you almost double the going rate (plus they rarely have seat belts and drive like maniacs)    Ask for the Concierge to drive you into your restaurant or destination in the hotel's shuttle and pay them instead for comfort and safety!

The reception and lobby areas are very well spread-out with comfortable seating all around. We were served hot Moroccan tea on arrival. The check-ins took some time but that was understandable as we had to check in for 8 rooms!  The rooms were a long walk away but definitely worth it! They are large spacious and very comfortable. Our room had a cot ready for our baby :) although it was more like a playpen and we didn't use it as it wasn't possible to bend so low to lay down a sleeping baby. The bed however was large enough. We weren't able to enjoy the spacious balcony due to the windy weather. The bathrooms are large and spacious too.  The breakfast in the restaurant was very wholesome with a lot of delicious choice!!! The eggs bar always had a long line though and took some time.  The resort premises were very beautiful and spacious. We visited the spa as well and enjoyed some really good relaxing treatments there.  The lobby restaurant was really good and helpful as one night we ordered some sandwiches and drinks very late at night and the waiter was extremely friendly and helpful.  The hotel was always fragranced with essences making us feel even more relaxed and refreshed! Moreover as we were a big group we were given a very good discountas well.

This hotel is 10 minutes from the centreand behind the hotel (walk for 10 minutes) there is a cinema and a shoppingmall and 5 minutes from disco pasha. We will come back at this lovely hotel!!!!!!  the 2 sisters de Keijzer from holland,Date of stay: November 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,goedereede,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Celinev474
Kenzi Menara Palace,GSSaini wrote a review Nov 2012,10,Kenzi Menara Palace is an AWFUL Hotel - Avoid at all costs!!!!,"PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT VISIT THIS HOTEL!!! I have never felt the need to write a review before but given the appaling excuse for a hotel that kenzi Menara professes to be I feel compelled to let others know that this is the worst hotel I have ever had the misfortune of staying at and should be avoided at all costs!!!!    I booked the kenzi menara palace hotel in morroco through Coop travel using Kouni for the two days of our honeymoon in Marrakech with breakfast only. This hotel is billed as a 5 star in the kouni guide and we booked this with an upgrade to the honeymoon suite.    We arrived at the hotel at 12.30pm in what was a beautiful lobby which promised a great deal. We sat down completed the usual details and were told to wait and provided with a wonderful mint tea. 15 mins passed and i asked if the room was ready but was told to wait another 15mins. Eventually after waiting 30mins i asked again and was told it would be another 30mins before the room was ready. After a total of an 1 hour and 40 mins of waiting they finally allowed us to enter our room. Upon entering the room the floor was still very wet smelt quite awful no flowers were in the room as per agreed and the safe was not working. After a 3 hour flight to what should have been the greatest vacation of our lives this really was the last thing we needed. I went down to reception and reiterated my disatisfaction. The ill trained employee then had the sheer gaul to tell me that the kenzi Menara like ""apparently all hotels in the world"" only allows check in at 4pm therefore and i quote ""should be grateful that the hotel allowed me to check in at 2.15pm and only had to wait 1 hour and 40 minutes to check in."" After a wait of a further 30mins a technician arrived to fix the safe. The flowers despite asking twice did not arrive. Instead by a way of an apology the hotel staff provided some complimentary water and an iced pastry. This was just day 1 of this awful hotel. Unfamilar with the lack of food available during certain hours we asked for some sandwiches from the hotel room service. This took an hour to arrive. On the evening of our first day we asked the concierge to order us a taxi. We were told the taxi had arrived only to be pushed aside so that a local morrocan resident staying at the hotel could take our taxi. It took 45 mins for my wife and i to be eventually given a taxi. Whilst i would not go so far as to say this amounted to racism (as my wife and i are british asian) i would say that throughout the stay we were treated with distain and lack of courtesy by the staff at kenzi menara palace and the word ""indi"" was used behind our backs around the hotel.    At the breakfast of the 3rd day upon finishing my omlette i was instantly struck by stomach cramps. The kenzi menara breakfast had indeed given me food poisoining. I have never looked forward so much to checking out of a hotel but even this was an awful and actually very unpleasant experience. The bill I recieved had a number of charges for phone calls and drinks. I had attempted to make a call to my kouni agent from my room but could not do so therefore went down to reception and asked them to call on my behalf. The Kenzi Menara staff did not tell me they would charge for calling from reception on my behalf and had charged me three seperate times. I complained about this to the reception staff. The most shocking thing was that then three staff including the manager began shouting at me in the lobby telling me to ""pay now"" the staff continually spoke over me and whispered what i can only assume were profounaties in arabic and the reception staff then stated and i quote ""every hotel in the world charges guests for any call locally made from reception"" furthermore i was then told by the reception staff ""i did not know what i was talking about because i am from England and have only stayed in English hotels"" despite the fact that i have visited over 28 different countries in the last 12 years. Eventually having lost my patience and seeing the obvious upset on my wifes face i handed over my credit card and told the receptionist to hurry up and charge me because the lack of customer service and utter disrepect they had shown me was too much to bear any longer. I then stated that i would be making a formal complaint and also be writing a review on trip advisor. After arguing for 40 minutes and eventually mentioning trip advisor they removed two our of the three phone call charges.    To summarise Kenzi Menara Palace is massively let down by its incompetent rude and utterly disrespectful staff and the food should be eaten with extreme caution. They are extremely slow in dealing with any requests no matter how minor. To give this hotel 4 or 5 stars is a complete travisty. This is a sub one star hotel the likes of which should be stricken from any responsible tour operater or travel agents books.    If there is anyone reading this review who is in any doubt or under the impression that i might have just had a one off bad experience i spoke with locals and others as far as Essaouria and the poor reputation of this hotel is shared by many. Thankfully we left this hotel and continued our honeymoon in Essaouria at the Sofital mogador Golf & Spa which more than made up for the horrible experience of Kenzi Menara Palace Morroco.",Date of stay: November 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GSSaini
Kenzi Menara Palace,Heather H wrote a review Oct 2012,50,Lovely Winter Break,The hotel was so welcoming! The manager and the assistant manager both approached us at different times to see if we were happy with our stay. This hotel is excellent if you want a really relaxing break because it is outside of the city it is very quiet although the hotel do have a free shuttle bus to the city we decided not to do this but an excellent member of staff (Sheriff) arranged a guide and a private minibus for 90 DHRS for 4 hours  this was great fun and we had a guide with us all the time so we did not get bothered all the time. Sheriff also arranged for us to go to a Morocco night out  We can highly recommend this as it gives you a taste of old Morocco. The food in the hotel is very well presented and the staff are so helpful.  The rooms are really big and very cleanThe only fault we can find is that twice we were locked out of our room but reception were really apologetic and sorted it out right away. one last thing both the swimming pools are fab ! And the staff at the outdoor pool are so helpful all the time. They are a real attraction to eating by the pool,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/223HeatherH
Kenzi Menara Palace,Richard G wrote a review Oct 2012,20,Kenzi Palace vrs Kenzi Club,"My wife and I booked separatly from our group of friends. It was not untill we arrived at the sister hotel of the Palace (Kenzi Club Agdul Medina) that we realised we had booked a different hotel.  After we had booked in and received our wrist band it was at that point the receptionist realised we should be at the Palace. It was our fault so no complaints so far.  So off we go and 50 MAD (for CAB) later we arrived.  It was after 10.00pm at this time and we were a little peckish. So we rushed to our room dropped our bags and rushed for a quick buffet. We indulged in a main course only and our first impression was the lack of choice. But heyho it was late and we were the only ones in the dining room. When I came to sign the bill I was outraged to see it was for 640 MAD for 2 buffets one lemonade and a small beer!!!!  So we were no way going to stay here for meals.  Following morning we explored the hotel. There was no one around! It was empty! No one at all at the pool and it was 10.30am! The hotel completely lacked soul.  Anyway each morning after breakfast (good and varied) we trooped up to the Kenzi club. The difference was unbelieveable. Lots of people but comfortable. Activities but not in your face pleasant smiley staff fantastic food (did I mention we got our all inclusive wristbands still attached!!).  The entertainment at night was also great.  As for the Palace it seams to be waiting for someone to give it a spark of life. It appears to me that it is set up for conferences not your average tourist. It appears to be suffering from over-confidence being a 5*. It is not relaxing and the staff are too formal.  On checking out I was waiting to discuss my aformentioned buffet bill. Typically they did not want to know. ""What price did you expect it is a 5* hotel"" bleated the checkout man.  Final insult was the local taxes to promote tourism!!. I refused to pay at first but looking at the mans face I thought a night in a Moroccan jail may not be worth saving the 100 MAD.  So there you have it my recomendation would be the Kenzi Club...brilliant. (no taxes to pay either).  By the way the market in the Medina is fantastic. At first you may feel intimidated but just get bartering and you'll be fine. Never felt threatened at all. If you really wish to make the most of seeing everything a guide is very useful. Do not pay more than 100 MAD for 4 hours and just accept that he will take you to his mates markets stalls first.  All in all Marrakech is delightful and its people very welcoming. Highly recommended.",Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Leicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/476RichardG
Kenzi Menara Palace,Nori I wrote a review Oct 2012,40,Nice Place for Peaceful Holiday,We stayed a cosy beautiful and traditional Riad in Medina first half of our holiday and spent the second half in Kenzi Menara Palace. It was a big contrast but we were happy with what we did.    1) Room:  We stayed on ground floor with garden view. It is a huge mainly clean well-equipped room. Bed was comfortable enough amenities are also good and enough. Bath room was also very big and you have bath tub separated shower cabin and separated toilet inside of bath room. The closets are surely big enough for 1-2 weeks stay. Two disadvantage is you can hear your neighbours very well and the furnitures on terrace were dirty.  2) Service:  Nothing personal at all (especially we came from Riad where everything was so personal – so the difference was big) but you can stay anonymous. Front desk concierge were helpful. I saw some people complained about final bill but it was fairly smooth without any mistakes for us. We ordered room service twice in the evening – it took about 30-45 minutes. Pool staff were also quick and friendly. The worst part was in the room. Even when we used up shampoos soaps and toilet paper they never re-filled. Sometimes towels were also missing! Not every staff understands English well so if you do not speak French it may cause some misunderstanding. So be patient and show some respect to staff.  3) Facilities:  Best part is the swimming pool – it is really big and you can swim very well. Of course you can hang around poolside without swimming. There’s a pool bar and you can order food and drink. In business centre you can use computer. If you ask for some sheets of paper you can also print out (the staff was very helpful). They have spa as well but we did not go.  4) Location:  It is far from Medina. It takes approx. 10 minutes by car. Hotel offers free transfer to main square once in 2-3 hours but you need to reserve it. Taxi costs approx. 50-60 MAD from city during the day (you need to negotiate). There are some clubs restaurants and a mid-size shopping centre nearby (5-10 minutes walk).  5) Breakfast:  Wide selection of food which includes some typical Moroccan staff like Harira soup. You can order eggs (omelette fried egg etc) just at the open kitchen – they cook it fresh. If you want mint tea you might need to wait.    It can be boring if you stay in this hotel for one week unless you arrange some excursion etc.  If you aim to go to Medina/Gueliz every day it is probably not practical place to stay. The advantage is you are away from the noise stress etc of Medina (that’s why it can be boring!) So if someone need lazy just book-reading and “dolce fa niente” style holiday it is good place to stay. If you want both and if time allows I can recommend to stay at first small traditional Riad in Medina followed by Kenzi Menara Palace.,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Zurich, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NIB70

After a phone call to the Hotel 10 minutes later a wonderful young man came flying into the airport full of apologies!!!!!  The staff in the Hotel are wonderful my broken glasses were taken from me on arrival and returned to me within 24 hours like new! All for 10 euros!  The Hotel is palatial beautifully decorated with large gardens and a huge swimming pool. The food was excellent - although buffet style but with a huge amount of choice. It is a 10 minute drive away from the Jemaa El Fna Square and so its necessary to use the Hotels free shuttle service or take a taxi which at the most will cost you 100 dirham. The area is very quiet and peaceful - so no noise at night.  Unfortunately there was no wifi in the room so couldnt use my ipad there but there was an internet connection for laptops. Wifi and computers were available in the lobby area. No coffee or tea making facilities in the room either.

Kenzi Menara Palace,debskez wrote a review Aug 2012,40,"After a rough start, a very pleasant stay!!!",We were transferred here after the Kenzi Agdal medina had overbooked. We had major problems as we had paid for all inclusive and this hotel was only half board. We were told that we could have soft drinks but no alcohol and would not be able to have lunch there ( i will state this was entirely the fault of the kenzi Agdal management and staff and the Kenzi Palace.). Adil the entertainment guy was fantastic. His English was very good so we could explain to him what we were entitled to and he managed to sort everything out for us. There were 10 of us in our party and we soon became well known to all the staff and manager ( who was adorable) The atmosphere in the evening was a bit dull and they could do with more entertainment during the day but never the less it was a beautiful hotel and we had a lovely stay. Sherif the concierge guy was absolutely fantastic his English was brilliant and he sounded like he come from the east end He was very very helpful and without him things would have been boring. The rooms were big and spacious and very clean ( only problem was the maid never left enough towels and we had to keep asking for more) The food was delicious antithesis plenty of choice. I would recommend a stay here. There is a local tax to be paid which is approx £3 a day per person (over 16's) which Low Cost Holidays failed to tell us about.,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Kingston upon Thames, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debskez
Kenzi Menara Palace,LK_MBE wrote a review Aug 2012,40,Beautiful Hotel- room for improvement,Got moved to this lovely hotel when the hotel Kenzi Agdal Club) was overbooked. It was 46 deg C when we arrived from the other hotel and we were met with mint tea and an iced towel.  The reception staff were very helpful and efficient and they all spoke very good English.    We had booked and paid for All Inclusive at the Agdal but were only given Half Board at this Hotel. We could have soft drinks local beer and wine at this Hotel but I am sorry to say that this information was not well communicated to the Menaraa staff and I have to say that by the end of the week I was a little tired of having to explain and put up with 'attitude' from some of the older members of the staff especially in the evening in both the Restaurant and lounge bar I take into account it was Ramadan and very hot but none of this was my fault. However this was a minority of staff most were very pleasant. (In fact the manager might want to send a few of his team down the road to the Kenzi Club to see what cheerful friendly customer service looks like)    The room was very spacious the housekeeping was great everything spotlessly cleanthe beds really comfortable and the air con was quiet and kept the room cool. (room 110). The rooms were not made for three people and my daughter slept on a put-you-up bed.    The pool was huge and there were plenty of sunbeds and sunshades available. The staff at the pool and pool bar were freindly and helpful. Just the place to escape the scorching heat.    My daughter and I also treated ourselves to a Hammam Scrub and Massage as the lovely Spa had a special offer available (about £35 each) this was well worth the money.    We were actually very lucky to have been put here as we did go back to the Agdal a couple of times and it was packed. I would strongly reccomend this hotel on half board as the food was very nice but be aware you have to pay for ALL drinks including water and you will pay 5 star prices!,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Colchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LK_MBE

Downside we have travelled to many places in the world and stayed in many three to five star hotels (Sofitel in Cairo last year )and it is the firt one that we have come across that charges for cofee / tea in the room most strange and just something that management could look into at about 75pence English per pod / teabag it is rather silly for a five star...instead they could charge for the shapoos and the shower gels they leave out but they dont most strange.  There may not be a VISA to pay when you enter Morocco but a tax is added to your daily bill for the Hotel and Resort (two charges) for the room everyone has to pay it. about £5-00 (English pound). a day so bewar of this extra fee at the end of your stay..  My billl also contained entries for the pool bar ( i had no poolside snacks / drinks during my stay so again ask for a print out and check it very very carefully.    During Ramadan the restaurant did not open until 9pm for dinner for guesst which is a bit late especially for children religion should not have affected non muslim guests..breakfast ok so why dinner disrupted?

Kenzi Menara Palace,GuelphTraveller wrote a review Jul 2012,40,Nice hotel but noise an issue,This hotel is a large modern resort. The rooms are big and comfortable and the TV provides an extensive list of free movies. The restaurant is also good with a large free breakfast buffet. There is a large swimming pool in the middle of the hotel. Staff are nice especially the Manager of the hotel who is the person to see if there is a problem. The big issue is that the hotel has two room locations pool side and garden side. Poolside is very noisy with constant screaming from kids. The garden view has no garden and the view is the roadway and a construction site. This is also very noisy. Make sure you ask not to have an adjoining room. If you want a quiet vacation this is not your hotel.

The grounds of the hotel are amazing well-kept and the pool oh the pool...It is gigaaantic! After a day of bargaining in the souks it was a treat to come back to our luxury hotel and rest in the room. My only complaint is that the shower did not have enough hot water for me (my husband was fine with it). I just like hot showers. The hotel staff (especially the two Fatimas) were very helpful and speak terrific English. The rest of the staff were less helpful but I think this was also because they did not speak or understand enough English. One of the perks of this hotel is that all the movies are free so in our leisure time we could relax with a good movie (there's an excellent selection). They have wi-fi in the lobby only but it works well.

Kenzi Menara Palace,kathryn a wrote a review Jul 2012,50,Amazing for the price! Recommend half board!,We stayed here 30th June - 7th July the hotel was quite quiet as it is the low season in Morocco between June and August due to the heat (very hot 42+) 10 mins from the main area of Marrakech and the taxi's are so cheap around £2/3 if you get a small one so who can complain about cost! We enjoyed being about 10 mins away as it gave us a break from the madness and the noise of the main centre. We stayed half board and got a very good deal only 2 of the 4 restaurants were open as there were so few guests but the two on offer were fantastic. The Moroccan was our favourite the waiters are usually very efficient especially Ali in the international restaurant. Breakfast was a wide range of cakes/ pasteries/ fruit/ yoghurt/ omlettes/ pancakes. The hot selection I wouldn't recommend as were usually cold and cold chips and lumpy scrambled egg aren't the best. We were slightly suprised about the fact we had to pay for drinks with our dinner as to us half board should include even a glass of water at least there is also an extra charge for certain meals but I would completely recommend taking the plunge and trying a few as the pastilla in the moroccan and the john dorry fish in the international are incredible. Presentation of all food was incredible and I have no complaints about any food!    The sunloungers are equiped with mattresses and towels and the staff around the pool are efficient and helpful. Beautiful big pool with the option of sitting under a sun umbrella or laying in the sun.    We had a massage each which was also incredible would recommend the poolside massage deal 100%!    We took two trips out whilst staying here as was arranged by our rep. one for a moroccan cookery class taken at riad le arabe (which was the most beautiful place I've ever seen) I would highly recommend a cookery class whilst there as it is so interesting and tasty! We also took a trip to the coast which is 2.5 hours away from the hotel it feels really cold there compared to round the pool but it's deceptive which we only discovered after being burnt!    Pacha is walking distance from the hotel and apparently the biggest nightclub in Africa however we didn't get told that it is only free to get in Mon - Thurs and only good on a Saturday!    the YSL gardens are also a recommended trip!    We had one small problem when there as the maid left our door open but as the safes are free and we had cleverly locked our important stuff away there was no real concern however on mentioning to the guys at the reception they didn't seem overly bothered which was quite annoying.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Anbari2011 wrote a review Jul 2012,30,Beautiful place but they could do way better,When I arrived I really liked the facility; plenty of space very large rooms very clean and a gorgeous pool. But then the small details which can make your stay unpleasant or at least not what you expect from a five star hotel. The breakfast was ok but nothing special. What was really annoying though were the birds flying in the dining area. I stepped away from the table to get something and came back to find the birds attacking my plate. This happens because they keep the windows of that area wide open. Here are some other details:  1. No Wi-Fi in the rooms so forget about enjoying your ipad / iphone etc. Wi-Fi only in the lobby. But guess what when I complained to the staff about how hot it is in the lobby they said we don’t have air conditioning in the lobby!  2. The mini bar in the room had beer water and juice. That’s it. The mini fridge is placed inside a closet and every time I tried to open the fridge door it would get stuck. Maybe just my room.  3. No phone in the living room only the bedroom. They should add another phone.  4. Although staff are very friendly but I think they could use more training. It might take you a while to get their attention especially at the poolside.    Like I said they can easily make this place way better with some small adjustments. I wouldn’t mind checking it out again the next time I’m in Marrakech.    And by the way this place is not cheap. I had a 'special' rate and paid about $220 a night.,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled on business,USA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anbari2011
Kenzi Menara Palace,maisie wrote a review Jun 2012,40,Very expensive with hidden costs,The hotel if gorgeous massive pool spacious rooms staff that will bend over backwards to help you but this hotel has no atmosphere what so ever.  I went to the hotel in the last week of june 2012 and there were hardly any guests and as the hotel is so large it makes it feel really empty. It has the potential to be an amazing hotel but because there was hardly anyone there and more staff then they needed it just didn't really have that 'holiday' vibe to it.  The website says that it is 10 minutes from the centre yes it's a 10 minute taxi ride you couldn't walk it though. There is also a small shopping centre with a supermarket about 15 minute walk away from the hotel. I would strongly recommend buying food here or in the town rather then eating at the hotel as it is very overpriced all be it very good food.  There was also a 'tourist tax' that was added onto the bill at the end of the stay it worked out to be quite a considerable amount. There is no warning of this on the holiday website we booked with or on the hotel website so keep some money spare!!    It is a gorgeous hotel with friendly staff and if you want a big pool with lots of luxury go here.

The rooms are also huge with good size balconies offering some private space. The location is about ten minutes south of the Medina with a free two hourly navette into the centre by Djeema al Fna. The central pool is also enormous within well landscaped gardens. After the bustle and hassle of the Medina it is a very welcome haven of peace and tranquillity. The very helpful concierge - Sharif will arrange trips and restaurants if you want to escape the hotel and city centre attractions. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Of the two restaurants the traditional Morrocan was by far the best with excellent food and wine and reasonably priced for what is a fairly expensive city. They cannot appear to cook fish sadly unless you like it chewy and dried out. They only other very minor deficiency was the slowness of getting coffee at breakfast (self service but good choice). Make sure to ask for a pot on the table.    Finally it is only about ten minutes from the airport which is a plus and the hotel has a navette for about €20. Alternatively you can get a taxi for €10 but agree the price first.,Date of stay: May 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Albi, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnTodd187167
Kenzi Menara Palace,Pat S wrote a review May 2012,30,Nice hotel but overpriced,The hotel is nice and the rooms are comfortable and spacious.    We had to change the room after the first night as there was a discotheque just opposite our room and the noise was unbearable the whole night long!    It took the front desk a while to organize a new room and we had to push them in general all the time as they were not very helpful. Luckily that we spoke French as not everyone spoke good English and they preferred to speak French anyway.    In the middle of the week they started hosting two different conferences at a time and from then on everything changed badly. The breakfast buffet was hardly refilled the other guests had to sit on dirty tables (no one changed the table cloth) and the staff was unfriendly and stressed.  Conference members should have separate meeting rooms / breakfast areas.  We would clearly not recommend staying there during a conference!,Date of stay: May 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Zurich, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatS713
Kenzi Menara Palace,Ubula wrote a review May 2012,30,Doesn't quite live up to the promise,"I stayed at this hotel in April 2012. It was a nice enough hotel but there were two main problems with it. First was the location. It says on the website that it is within sight of the ""city walls"" and a few minutes from the main square. Not quite the reality. The ""city walls"" are the walls that surround the Agdal Gardens a vast garden that lies to the south of the Royal Palace. The actual city is about 2.5km away. As for the main square it is a few minutes away - by car. To walk it is over 4km so about an hour along busy roads beside empty scrubland or building sites. The hotel lays on a shuttle bus but it is only every two hours - 1012141618.00 - so if you miss it you have to take a taxi or wait. Also no good for any evening visits as the last bus returns at 18.30. The other problem is the noise. The hotel is surrounded by roads - look it up on Google Earth - so there is traffic noise all the time and it is near the airport directly under the flight path.  Having said that if you are not so fussed about noise or the location it is a pleasant place to stay. There is a huge pool and spa the room was very big and well equipped plus had a large balcony. The bathroom was large with bath and shower. Lovely gardens and the food was very good with especially generous buffet breakfasts. I found the place comfortable but a little too corporate for my taste. Also I was disappointed by the location and the noise.",Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ubula
Kenzi Menara Palace,rubles1 wrote a review May 2012,40,holiday experience,This hotel is certainly well worth a visit handy for the centre airport and trips to atlas mountains. Our experience of the staff was very good -all spoke good english and were very pleasant and helpful. Sharif (apologies if spelt wrong) arranged guided trips with private guides for us which were really beneficial to our stay. He always had a smile on his face although sometimes more genuine than others!!!  The room was superb with the largest bed I have ever seen and a bath you did not want to leave. The breakfasts were nothing special but a good variety to choose from. Some mornings however were very chaotic with an obvious lack of staff to keep up with table clearing etc.  Having stayed in both 4 and 5 stars previously I would personally class this as a 4 star as I agree with a previous report that something  although I am not sure what appears to be lacking.  The major complaint would be the ridiculous prices charged for drinks and food. I am aware that whilst staying in a 5* hotel prices are inflated - however I am sure they would sell much more both from room mini bar and hotels bars if the prices were more competitive.eg A small bottle of sparkling water costs 40 d from room mini bar ( approx £4) the exact bottle at carrefour 5mins walk is 3 d !!!

Maybe not five stars by Western standards but a great hotel none the less. Our room was huge with the biggest bed I have ever slept in. The bathroom was first class and the living room very comfortable with two great balconies on our suite with furniture on both.    The staff were polite and most spoke good English. The restaurants were all very good but the restaurants in town were more authentic in cruising and better value for money. The Spa was very good. I would recommend using the concierge for all taxi restaurant and tourist bookings so as to not get 'tourist' prices.

Kenzi Menara Palace,kkltd wrote a review Apr 2012,30,Just average,we arrived from essaouira in the afternoon to discover this place was quite far out of town and would be a good taxi journey into the centre which was a bit disappointing as it describes it and shows it on the map as being more central. (40riel a trip) although taxis want to rip you off constantly from here and the bell boys are happy to let them. On our last day the guy in white with the hat on (door staff) was even angry with us for bargaining and I went and got my own taxi cheaper. To which he even walked off in a temper. Good service I think not. rooms were ok but lack character. And £3 for a teabag Is just excessive. view looking to waste ground far away from lobby was nothing special. swimming pool area was ok and I was sitting out there relaxing at around 5.30pm and I was told the guy had to take my cushion? bar staff were friendly. breakfast was just ok with it finishing at 10. It was just ok with good rooms close to not much apart from a small shopping centre. service was not good. I was not happy and would not stay here again.

Kenzi Menara Palace,MarkJ0j0 wrote a review Mar 2012,40,"Impressive hotel, lovely room, great value, but lacking character..",Stayed here to compare it to a Riad on our first trip to Marrakech. Great value for the room and breakfast - and a great place to unwind and catch the sun - but if you want to experience Marrakech and the true spirit of Morocco you will find a riad has more character and is likely to be better located.    Our room however was massive and had a lovely bathroom and felt truly 5*. Some trek from the main part of the hotel and spa. We viisted during early March and the outdoor pool was too cold to swim in however a small indoor pool was great - had it to ourselves and was included free. Breakfast was good with a wide choice but everything else (drinks food spa) just felt too expensive. Service in the hotel was very good and we were well looked after ( - check in/out breakfast room maid service by the pool sorting out an extra shuttle ride..).    Biggest problem was getting to and from the Medina. Shuttle bus times are too limited (every two hours sometimes full) and service stops at about 18.00. If the hotel could improve this service and also provide a more flexible pick up in the evening then this would be an excellent choice - however what you save by choosing this hotel you will probably spend in taxis or pay over the odds for in the hotel.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Ross E wrote a review Mar 2012,50,Fantastic Hotel,Having always worked in the travel industry and been lucky enough to have stayed in some of the worlds leading hotels I was very impressed by the Kenzi Menara Palace    My room was very large modern and very well decorated. I had a very large verandah with room enough for 6 people to sit. The lobby was very impressive and the bar/lounge area were beautifully decorated.    The grounds are very well tended and the large swimming pool and sun terrace made the perfect place to relax and soak up the sun.    What I liked most about this hotel is the customer service delivered by the staff. They couldnt have been more friendly and helpful throughout my stay.    The hotel is 10 minutes from the Medina and a taxi cost 100 Dirham (£7). Alternatively the hotel operate a free shuttle regularly throughout the day. In my opinion the location was a plus as after a busy day shopping in the souks it seemed like the perfect haven to get back to and relax.

Kenzi Menara Palace,AgadirTrip wrote a review Feb 2012,40,Beautiful resort,I stayed at this hotel for three nights in February. I made reservations through Expedia and paid online for poolview rooms. When I arrived I was given street view without even letting me know we found out when we got to the rooms. I called the front desk and they said they were totally booked and maybe they could accomodate us the next day. I was a bit upset but there wasn't much we could do since they said they were booked. The next morning I went back to the reception and spoke to Soufiane he gave me the rooms with pool view right away and told me that he may need to switch me to yet another set of rooms the following day. I didn't object as I had aready decided that we will not be moving anywhere since we paid for those rooms. Eventually no one called to tell us that we had to move and stayed in those rooms until we checked out. The checkout was very quick less than five minutes. The service in other areas could do better. The room service don't put soap in the bathroom every day. We had two small soaps for 3 nights in each room! Kleenex boxes were empty and were never changed during our stay. The hotel maybe seeing these items as an exra cost for customers it's something we pay for. The breakfast was included in the stay it was good overall but could do better. Restaurant menu was very limited and overpriced. Someone mentioned in the review that there was no coffee in the rooms we had a coffee machine in each room but you pay for each coffee or tea bag you use (30DH each I believe). I wasn't surprised by any hidden fees Expedia already mentioned that I will be paying 30DH tax per person/per day. As far as location I personally liked the fact that it is away from the hustle and bustle and they offer free shuttle.  To sum it all up beautiful resort with very large rooms and very courteous personnel.,Date of stay: February 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Houston, Texas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AgadirTrip

Kenzi Menara Palace,hugaby wrote a review Feb 2012,10,"Bad, Bad BAd",Would not recommend this hotel very disorganised and staff were completely unhelpful. I had booked for the hotel car to pick us up from the Airport and for the fare to be booked to my room account. The car did not turn up I needed to phone the hotel 3 times and wait for over 90 minutes before a car arrived and then the driver insisted that we paid him (although this had been charged to my room account). The hotel would not or could not phone me to let me know what was happening. The rooms are basic and although I asked many times the coffee machine leaked water all over the dresser. I had also booked a twim room and it was made up as a double this meant we had to wait for someone to come and change the room around. The area around the hotel is a desert there is nothing in the area and although the blurb states it is only 10 denar to get into town the concierge is in cahoots with the taxi drivers and they try and charge over 100 denars to get into town. It ended up being too difficult to try and go out at nights.    This is supposed to be a 5 star hotel it didn't have the 5 star facilities. The blurb on the internet stated that it has robes slippers and ameneties in the room there werent any even if one asked at reception these were never put into the room. There were none of the amenities one would expect from a 5 star hotel.    Don't go during Ramadan the staff dont know or care what is going on and do not want to assist in any manner.    I had a sun umbrella by the pool crash down on me (and I am disabled) and all they could do was to shrug their shoulders.    The food at the hotel is mediocre at best and incredibly overpriced they have a captive audience and cant be bothered to make an effort    Make sure you take your own tea and coffee with you as they wanted to charge 6 euro per tea bag or coffee sachet.,Date of stay: August 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Camberley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hugaby

Kenzi Menara Palace,Jacob J wrote a review Dec 2011,50,Very excellent hotel - but outside town,The place is nice spacious and well kept. Rooms are huge and have all you will expect from a 5 star hotel and well equipped with shower and tub safe internet (cable only) flat screen TV (about 100 channels mostly French but also US UK German Spanish Italian...). My room was on ground floor so I had a terrace with ample furniture and grass around. Some ground floor terraces are somewhat open for insight from others so ask for one or two floors up where there are balconies if you require privacy.  There is also coffee machine but beware of the pricing: one tea bag cost me 30 Dhr or 3 Euro (local supermarket was asking 11 Dhr for a pack of 25 tea bags).    The park around the buildings is extremely well kept and quite beautiful to wander around in. Pool area is huge and with all facilities. The pool is not heated though (too cold in early December)    The restaurants are all very good and the prices is reasonable (150 Dhr or 15 Euro for an average main course). Bar is cosy but somewhat overpriced (100 Dhr or 10 Euro for one local beer and one juice). Also the business centre is OK and there is WiFi in the main areas. Both bizcentre and WiFi is free. I attended a conference and again the meeting rooms and auditorium were all fine.    There are some complains in other reviews as to the location. Some comes from the wrongful perception the hotel is trying to give (their web site has a map showing that the hotel is nearby the fortified walls around Marrakesh and this is wrong: the walls are around the “Gardens of Agdal” located south of the city) also by indicating that the main square of Marrakesh is 10 minutes away (only 10 minutes by car in the middle of night). But once you get to term with the location in the developing district south of the city and of the airport you can enjoy the neighbourhood nearby shopping centre (300 meters including a Carrefour) and the nice restaurants and night clubs of nearby hotels.    The hotel shuttle is free and will take you to city centre but (as mentioned in other reviews) one must insist on the driver going to the agreed spot. Also remember to make an eye to eye agreement about picking up spot and time (and don’t be angry if it is running 10 or 15 minutes late).,Date of stay: December 2011,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Copenhagen, Denmark",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jacob57

Kenzi Menara Palace,N S wrote a review Nov 2011,50,November break,I booked Kenzi Menara Palace after reviewing numerous hotels on Tripadvisor. As there were a few negative reviews for Kenzi Menara (as there was for most Marrakech hotels) I was a little apprehensive on what my wife and I would find on our first trip to Morocco. I cannot emphasise enough the delight at what we found. The hotel is absolutley lovely and the people who work there are extremely friendly. (The photos on all the hotel and booking websites do not do this hotel justice!)    After two days in the hotel I rearranged our bookings for the week such that we stayed at the hotel again before going home. (We had originally booked 4 nights at Kenzi Menara and 3 nights at a riad in the Medina. I changed so that we reduced to 2 nights at the riad and we could spend one more night at Kenzi Menara.)  The rooms are extremely spacious clean and luxurious. The in-room safes have an internal power supply so that you can charge your laptap while it is in the safe. The bathrooms are beautifully arranged and very spacious.    While our room had satelite TV it did not have a great choice of English speaking channels.    The restaurants in the hotel serve lovely food and the inclusive breakfast is a fabulous and extremely generous mix of 'western' and local products.    The external gardens and pool was a major surprise as at the time of booking we did not note this detail from the websites. The outdoor pool is one of the largest hotel swimming pools that I have ever come across and the surrounding gardens are extremely well maintained.    The hotel is situated about 10 minutes away from the Djeema el Fna but the hotel does provide a courtesy bus that runs every two hours between 10.00am and 6.00pm. If you want to stay in town later you can get a taxi back for about €10.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Caroline R wrote a review Nov 2011,50,very pleasant stay,I stayed here for 5 nights with my 17 year old daughter. Booked as part of a package deal with Sovereign and found it comfortable and very good value (except the dreaded minibar). We got a taxi from the airport- 100 dirhams should be what you pay (not 200 as we did). Arrived at 10am and were into our room by 12 noon- upgraded to an enormous suite (2 rooms 2 blconies bathroom and 2 loos) which could probably have lived in for several months! Rooms huge well equipped and big TV with lots of chanels and free films on demand.We were on a noisy road and building work was outside across the road- but noise kept out completely by the double glazing. The hotel is large and a bit corporate but pool area is beautiful with a full sized pool and lots of loungers. Free shuttle bus into centre of town only goes 4 times a day but there are always taxis and it only costs 40 dirhams to get the main square.  Staff were pleasant and professional and nearly all spoke good English so I am not sure why previous people had any problems. We had a couple of minor problems which were all dealt with very well and with no fuss -including the ones which were our own fault i.e the fuse blew is the room (see mention below of travel kettle) and my daughter dropping an earing down the sink (expertly retreived by the plumber).  Good buffet breakfast- plenty of choice including eggs cooked ot order. We ate in the resaurant on one night-not amazing but nothing with the food and not very over-priced (expensive for Morocco but cheap for this kind of hotel).  But yes the minibar is v. expensise and DO bring your own tea and coffee and a travel kettle (but don't let it overheat and blow the fuse)- there is a water boiling coffee maker but I couldn't to get it to work without using the coffe capsule. The Carrefore supemarket in the Mall behind is a 5-10 minutes walk and we got some wine and drinks from there and kept them in the fridge- no-one complained.

There is a shuttle bus to the medina unfortunatelly only every 2 hours but better then no shuttle bus. The pool is also big. It is one of the cheaper hotels in Marakech in this categorie including breakfast.

Kenzi Menara Palace,trvlr15 wrote a review Sep 2011,40,Very relaxed.,Stayed here for one week with my girlfriend. Found the ambience of the hotel to be very relaxed. The common spaces and rooms are large and the hotel seemed to be quiet. Very easy to relax and be left to do so.    Room was a very good size and the bed was large and very comfortable. Good sized bathroom with two sinks and excellent seperate shower cubicle. Terrace was a good size and unlike other eviews I personally preferred the privacy of the garden view. A pool view would have been noisier and less private. Pool view would be better if you enjoy people watching but not if you prefer privacy.    I found both restaurants to be good except when the evening offering was a buffet. The buffet was overpriced and of a rather poor standard. The quality of the buffet food is what I would expect to recieve at a 3 star all inclusive resort not a 5 star hotel with a charge of the equivalent of 30 odd Euros. The eveing buffet should be viewed as embarrasment to the hotel. Otherwise I found the food of a high quality and reasonable price. For better priced food pop round the corner to the shopping mall for a varied selction of fare.    Swimming pool area is large and has comfortable loungers. Pool itself is big and the temperature nice and cool. I would advise sitting as far as possible from the pool bar to avoid being subjected to the hideous music they insist on playing on a daily basis. Drinks prices are high and it is adviseable to pop round to the Carrefour supermarket at the shopping mall to purchase water at a quarter of the bar price.    The Spa costs extra but is reasonably priced and very good indeed. Particularly enjoyed the Hammam. Price for the use of the indoor pool is not worth it.    Overall I really enjoyed our stay here but there is room for impovement. The evening buffet is not on every night but is awful. The music at the pool bar is also in need of either changing or turning off. The hotel is far from the town centre but there is a free shuttle bus. We did not find this a problem but it may be too far out for some peoples taste.,Date of stay: September 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Scotland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trvlr15
Kenzi Menara Palace,Paul E wrote a review Sep 2011,30,Could be much better!,"My Girlfriend and I stayed at the Hotel for a week. We had several discussions about the Hotel and it's facilities and have decided to write a decent review detailing some of the finer details and hopefully paint a picture for future guests expectations.    The Hotel is overall a great place to stay and I would return there if I ever come back to Marrakech. Unless of course the new Raffles Hotel is open in which case I would choose that over the Kenzi Menara.    The huge Swimming Pool is a delight. It's maintained at a cool temperature so no matter how hot the day gets a dip is always refreshing. Prices for Drinks and Snacks throughout the Hotel are reasonable but bare in mind that a 2l bottle of water from the Poolside Bar will cost you 30.00 MAD whilst the exact same bottle 'Sidi Ali' will cost you 4.00 MAD at the Carrefour Supermarket around the corner. So a little high on the profit mark-up you could say.    The Room was excellent very spacious and well cooled great on-demand TV service plenty of wardrobe drawer space and the bed was huge and very comfortable. The Bathroom was decent standard the fittings seemed a bit cheap at first look and on day two our toilet flush got stuck and on day five the plug got stuck in one of the two sinks.    Our Coffee machine also broke and leaked water all over the floor. The hotel were told on day two the engineer came to look at it told us he'd return in 30 minutes but never came back.    Be advised that the Spa facilities are extra even a 25 minute Sauna session will cost you.    My one BIG complaint. The Restaurants.    Seriously without going on too much the Moroccan Restaurant is awful! Really bad. The Cous-Cous tasted of boiled gherkin and we were not even given Harissa? It was Mutton and not Lamb as advertised and I had about 30g of meat amongst a tonne of grains with limp Veg. Skip it and go to Al Fassia which is amazing and about 10 minutes walk from the Hotel.    The other Restaurant was open on our first night and was excellent! However for the following four nights this Restaurant was closed and a hot buffet was served instead? The hot buffet was horrible. The kind of food you expect in a 2 star hotel. Not 5 star at all. The best part? It's charged at 300 MAD per head which is outrageous!    The reason for the buffet replacing the Restaurant we were told by the Management was because there was ""A lot of guests at the Hotel"". if this is true I find it ridiculous.    Frankly the Hotel was almost empty? Very mysterious.    Well there is plenty of great Restaurants in Marrakech - Al Fassia and Pepe Nero for example so if the main Hotel Restaurant is open try it once but make plans to go out and spend your money elsewhere for your other nights.",Date of stay: September 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Lausanne, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C161UCpaule

It is a pretty new hotel with large rooms modern settings and furniture. I found it spotless clean. The food is good compare to what you usually find in hotels although don't have too high expectations in that area. It is situated in the new Agdal zone which is very quiet but a bit far from the city center if you don't have a car. On the other hand I think you can find cabs easily.

Staff could not have been more friendly - a quiet haven    The Morroccan restaurant was a wee bit pricey but the selection of tangine dishes the setting and the service was great    Hotel staff can arrange a guide at a reasonable cost to take you to the Medina and other sites - this is a hassle free way to see what the area has to offer however watch out for hidden costs e.g visits to attractions were you have to pay extra to get in.,Date of stay: February 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgina_om

Kenzi Menara Palace,MrsO wrote a review Aug 2011,40,A very nice hotel,I was nervous after reading some of the reviews on here but we had a lovely time at the Kenzi Menara palace. Friendly greeting with a welcoming glass of mint tea. Helpful staff (although sometimes there was a language barrier).  We were in one of the standard rooms so the view was not great from our balcony but the room was very large spacious and clean. The bathroom was the same with a separate shower cubicle and very large bath.    Breakfast was also nice with a chef on hand to make your eggs as you would like it. Overall we were very happy with our stay.    The only down side for some may be the location. We thought it was great being able to get away from the hustle and bustle of the main square. But this does mean that you need to jump in a taxi which involves bartering for a while to get a reasonable price and this can be exhausting.    We would recommend this hotel and we would go back.,Date of stay: July 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashadeyashley
Kenzi Menara Palace,Foodie_Az6 wrote a review Jul 2011,40,Helpful tips,This was our first visit to Marrakech with my family. When we booked our holiday we requested for a conecting room as there were four of us but that didn't happen.  We booked half board thinking it's going to be a buffet lunch or dinner but instead it was alacart menu which we were really dissapointed with as we were not told this when we booked. When I asked the hotel manager he told me that they only have buffets between sept and dec.  Also before you go to the gym make sure you call and check if the air-conditioning is on.  I must say the staff were really attentive and helpful.  Even though it's a five star hotel it's too expensive. You should go to the suppermarket behind the hotel. They also have a food court on the top floor of this shopping centre.  Overal we did have a good holiday but did feel that we were ripped off quite a lot as they knew we were tourists. Everyone from the drivers tour guides to the salesmen are working together trying to make money off you so make sure you go really really low in price from what they ask and stick to it and as u walk away they will let you have it for the price you offered. It's a pain but if there's something you really want that's the only way.,Date of stay: July 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,Reading,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Foodie_Az6
Kenzi Menara Palace,violet_786 wrote a review Jul 2011,30,Not as great as we thought,I returned from Marrakesh just yesterday and had stayed at the KENZI Menara palace for 3 nights - Firstly upon arrival our room was upgraded from a double garden view room to a studio type room - we were not told until we entered our room and opened the curtains to see a car park - however we did not complain as we thought we were only there for 3 nights.  For a 5* hotel - they did not provide an iron and ironing board - we were told to go down the road to get our clothes ironed for 20 dhirrums (however there is no down the road as the hotel is in the middle of nowhere). I also thought this was rubbish as it is more convenient to have an iron in your own room than go somewhere else to iron your clothes.  The 'studio' was very hot - we complained about the AC 3 times before someone came to look at it. Even then it did not seem to work and the members of staff seem to ignore our problem from then on. This is not the type of service i was expecting from a 5* hotel.  I didn't think the staff were very friendly if anything they could be a little arrogant if you complained a few times.  I generally found the service provided by this hotel slow.    The pros for this hotel are:  the free shuttle bus that runs are specific times of the day.  the garden is very nice  swimming pool is very nice    We had buffet breakfast which i thought was pretty average - nothing special.  My husband had also read somewhere that the hotel was only a 10minute walk from the medina - but this is not the case it is a 10 min drive. You need to drive anywhere you want to go because the hotel is in the middle of nowhere. But this can be a good thing if you like quiet hotels and want peace & quiet from the Medina.    I personally would not recommend this hotel as i do not feel it gives you value for money as a 5* hotel.,Date of stay: July 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/violet_786

Kenzi Menara Palace,Marise_Pace_2011 wrote a review May 2011,50,Lovely Stay,The hotel is a few minutes away from the airport and the free shuttle service from the hotel drops you in the city centre in no time at all. The Staff at the Kenzi Menara Palace Hotel are so nice and helpfull and go out of their way to help you. The concierge was really helpfull and gave us a good deal when we booked our trips to the old city the new city and the atlas mountains. We did private tours and I have to say that both the driver and the tour guide where really nice besides the fact that the cars that drove us around where clean nice and airconditioned. Beware of the souq its true that you have to negotiate with the sellers but be carefull because you can find much cheaper. We fell in love with the tea pots and the tea glasses but in the end we got the same exact thing from a Carfour supermarket (behind the hotel ) for a fraction of the price even at the airport you can get them much much cheaper than the souq. There is a big shopping centre behind the Kenzi so if you want to shop for clothes its perfect. It's a 5 minute walk and you find all the good brands and also good restaurants. Make sure you drink the fantastic mint tea from this fantastic hotel....they do it in such a way that you end up asking the waiter how the hell they manage to get it so right!! The rooms are clean and the b'fast is very good. The only thing that we were a bit disapointed was the service at the SPA. The Hotel gave us a free hammam treatment and the girl behind the reception just walked us into this hammam room and left us there. We knew what we had to do in a hammam but another client of the Kenzi might not. Another great thing is the smell of fiori d'arranco all over the place we liked it so much that we got the oil to burn at home and by the way it was the reception who gave us the address of the shop that the hotel buys the oil from......do i need to say more about the splendid service at this great hotel???,Date of stay: May 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Rome, Italy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marise_Pace_2011

We could not wait to move out from this big but valueless hotel.  1. Our room keys only worked on the 1st day. the rest of the stay we had to recharge our key whenever entering the room still no guarantee the key will open the room after being recharged. They said not to put the key near a cellphone. I didn't even bring my cellphone to Marrakech. No one ever apologized and felt sorry for me going back and forth recharging keys 6 times a day !  2. The front office staff is very good at pointing you to another person every time you have a question or concern to ask. The attitude was ""go away and ask someone else"". For every question asked whether where to buy clothes because I lost my luggage where to eat outside the hotel how come my key didn't work how far is to Medina by taxi what to buy in Jemma Al Fna anything I asked they always referred me to others.  3. The food was tasteless. The 1st night I decided to make it easy for me and my son to eat in the hotel. We could not finish our 3rd bite of the steak. We just eat the bread and paid for the steak.

Kenzi Menara Palace,raycongo wrote a review Apr 2011,50,"Great hotel away from the mediana, huge rooms, friendly service, impeccably clean",We have thoroughly enjoyed the Kensi Menara palace which has vastly more positives than negatives. Some of the negative reviews (on TA)are quite unfair particularly in regards the location. It is outside the hussle and bussle of the center and all the better for it. Its only a 10 minute drive in the very cheap taxi anyway.  The rooms are beyond spacious huge enormous and well fitted. Pool view is lovely and service is very friendly and generally competent.  We did find the lunch and evening menu to be rather uninspired and were happy to have chosen the bed/breakfast package as there are some delicous restauants in the nouvelle ville and medina. Breakfast buffet is grand mind.  We has 1 issue with the restaurant service at lunch which the staff were very apologetic about and provided an exeptional service thereafter ( including some nice surprise gifts in the room).,Date of stay: April 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Luxembourg District, Luxembourg",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raycongo

The rooms and suites are spacious and very comfortable. The hotel was fully booked but never felt crowded beautiful large pool and very friendly service throughout. The hotel is a +/- 10 min cab ride away from the center which means that nights are so quiet you can sleep with your balcony door open. Cabs are cheap and there is also a hotel shuttle to the main square. This will not give you the bustle and intimate feel of the Medina.

Kenzi Menara Palace,glamtrotter wrote a review Aug 2010,30,Stranded In The Middle Of Nothing.,"In general I like this hotel for what it is. It was a quick stop while on our way to Asia from NYC and I only did a quick tripadvisor search because I was so over doing all the research for the main leg of our journey. I had read about the pool not being open but only after I booked the hotel and even then didn't know how much of a pain this would be since I had never experienced heat like this before.    If I could have walked around the Medina in wet clothes or just a bikini I would have. They do provide a shuttle to another Kenzi hotel down the street and I totally wish I had booked that one because it was BEAUTIFUL with a fun DJ while this one just feels old in comparison! That hotel is also full of people while this one felt pretty light on guests. There was an indoor pool at the spa we could have used as well and if you like to be the only person when you swim you will love it. We had breakfast in the hotel each day and dinner there twice. The food was good and the service from everyone was really nice. That was the one thing that I really liked about the hotel so I just overlooked the pool being closed.    I already knew that taxis would overcharge you if you ride from the hotel but because I was usually not ready around the time the free hotel taxi took you into town I did not mind. I just made sure to find a taxi who did not have a ""broken meter"" on the return trip. (Lots of taxi drivers try to rip you off in this city and say the meter is broken so it may actually be hard to find.) We finally did take the shuttle on the last day but I really wish I had not because it really tainted my view of the hotel.    I was already a little sketchy about the place because everyone kept trying to push tours and such on us hard but honestly everyone in Marrakech was out to make a buck. We had planned everything out before we flew there so there was no need to book anything through the hotel.    One of the places the shuttle drops people off at is the ""new city."" There was a man and his child who got let out next door at Pacha and then it was just myself and another female in the car. The older male driver had already been the first person at the hotel who was just not pleasant but on top of it all he dropped us off in front of a pile of rubble and points out that where we need to go is in the opposite direction. Conviently he drops us off by another man he gets off the shuttle and starts speaking to who is of course a cab driver and says he can take us the rest of the way. Of COURSE the meter is not working and at this point there is NO ONE is nearby and NO OTHER TAXIS and THE GUY FROM THE HOTEL IS PULLING OFF. I would have rather just rode back to the hotel at that time but since we were stranded all I could do was get in the taxi since I had no idea how far down the road I was from where I was trying to go. The guy told us 40 Dh to get a few minutes down the street by Zara as a reference in the ""new city"" and then when we got there he changed his mind and said he wanted 20 more AFTER giving him a 5Dh tip just so he could just be quiet and take us where we needed to be because he kept trying to take us to ""his brother's shop which is the best place to eat"" or ""leather shops his friend owns."" This guy was litterally pulling over showing us papers ads of these places lol!    Coming from NYC I have no problem yelling at a pain in the butt cab driver and had it at that point between the two of them....I started yelling and refused to give the other 20 but 40 was still over priced.    I read tripadvisor all the time and the reviews are pretty much dead on so I've never felt the need to write my own review before. After complaining to the hotel and the only thing they could say was that the guy dropped us where no one was because it was ""hot"" so nobody was around.....I figure let you all decide for yourself because as hot as it was.....as soon as we actually made it to the square there were TONS of people both local and on vacay.

Most of the team were polite and courteous although if you had an issue it was slowly resolved if at all. We waited all day for an extra bed and after not leaving a camera in the safe this was taken from our room and staff were very unhelpful with no accident reporting procedure nor any response or apology from the Manager. Food was very good with a buffet breakfast fit for a king. Ali in the Restaurant was particularly helpful with any queries or questions throughout our stay. The bar was closed by 11pm every night and the mini bar charges far to high.    The pool was amazing however the weekend got very busy and at one point we were refused towels and umbrellas and in 40 degree heat this is NOT 5* service.    The bedrooms were huge and cleanliness levels throughout the hotel were outstanding. As previously mentioned Air Conditioning was feeble and never felt cool even when maintenance did attempt to fix it.

Mohammed and Ali in the restaurant were always keen to make you feel welcome and spoke good English as did most of the staff well much better than my French anyway :) nice walk around the gardens every day a massage and relax by the pool if you want the madness of the Medina and main square it's five mins away in a taxi. Hotel is situated in the quieter southern part of the town and if your mad enough you can walk into the centre. You are 10 mins from the airport by taxi. Hotel charges two additional taxes tourist and some other thing equates to 80MAD per day extra.. the worst of the rooms are fine and the best are very spacious indeed. my room had internet access and think there was wifi in the lounge pool bar area is very nice but pity not open in evening. It was very quiet which only served to make it more exclusive for me. Some local building going on but never bothered me and you are very close to airport where the local Moroccan air force are flying daily it was quite cool to watch them flying in formation.

Kenzi Menara Palace,SinisaK wrote a review May 2010,50,KMP review,OK the hotel is absolute fantastic but like in whole Morocco you need to be careful. I have read previous reviews here and I was warned about additional costs. There where list of prices of Mini bar so I can see before all prices. 4euro Cola Fanta Schweppes in 033 can also water in 05 bottle. 9 euros 01dcl for votka gin wiskey and 6euros for 033 can of Heineken.  I took Fanta and Schwppes on first night and that was all I took form Mini bar in my 3 night stay. Next day they didn't put new can of Fanta and Schweppes and that was a problem because on the last day they tried to charge me like I took Fanta and Scheweppes two times. So watch on that if you don't want to have a problem. Also on final bill they wrote that I have consume a bottle of wine and cola light in L'Oriental bar and that I have sign the bill with my room number to charge me that. But I didn't took that and they cannot find that bill but I need to write all that on that bill that I didn't do that. Finally I paid only 8euros for what I took fro the mini bar.    Besides that everything was fine. Rooms are biiiiggggg beds are great I sleeped very well. TV has lots of programs including all JSC Sports package there are lots of movies and music you can watch and listen on TV. In rooms there are ADSL and in the looby they have WLAN both free of charge. Breakfast is similar every day there are 6-7 hot and also 6-7 cold meals and you can eat as much as you can. I have used outdoor pool even at the cloudy day when it was 18°C till 4 pm. After sun came up it was not a problem to be in the pool.    We have used hotel van to go in the city for 1 time (free of charge but have a scheduled start) all other times we used taxi. There was WTCC race around the hotel in those days so every taxi driver tried to charge us 15euros for a drive to or from Djelma el Fna as they told us that they need to go around but that was a tipical lie so 5-6 euros (50-60 dirhams) is enough at the day and 9-10 euros at night. Just told them that yesterday you have paid 50 dirhams and how it's possible that today is 150 (usualy they start with 150 dirhams).    I didn't have a time to use a Spa.    If you want to have relaxing and quiet vacations this is a great place.,Date of stay: May 2010,Trip type: Traveled on business,Zagreb,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SinisaK
Kenzi Menara Palace,DeeDeeWorcestershire wrote a review May 2010,30,Only Aspires to 5 Star,Positives - the Pool Bar service and food was excellent. Pool was lovely but a liitle cool at the moment. Lunch was wonderful with great salads & various hot dishes including a great Tagine. Beds were very comfortable and the rooms and bathrooms a good size with good storage. Grounds were pleasant.    Service - not up to 5 star standard apart from one lady in the bar who was very professional: most of the others could not cope with an order of more than two drinks - in fact they served other people and had to be reminded of our order.  Restaurant service was appalling apart from one gentleman at lunchtime - good and enthusiastic. In the evening the food was always luke warm and on one occassion we had almost finished the main course before the wine was poured.    Negatives - Air conditioning either did not work at all or was feeble - a real problem. There were problems with patio latches not working. This is definately a conference hotel and after only a year the fixtures and fittings are failing. The toilet roll holder in our room was pulling away from the wall. It appears that the fittings are not up to even 4 star standard!  Bar mini bar & restaurant wine prices.- too expensive for a hotel that does not give the service. Coke was 50dhs - it should only be around 35dhs for this type of hotel. This follows through all the drinks.  The hotel is away from the centre but there is a shuttle & taxis are efficient.  We also were there the weekend that they had the Grand Prix - it ren right next to the hotel & was very noisy and spoilt sitting by the pool. The hotel did not inform our tour company of this event.    Suggestion - Information on where to go what to see where to eat. How to get taxis etc etc. No information in the rooms and asking at reception for every little detail was time consuming.    Would we go back to Marrakech - yes  Would wego back to this hotel - no,Date of stay: May 2010,Trip type: Traveled on business,Worcestershire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeeDeeWorcestershire
Kenzi Menara Palace,Athens85 wrote a review Apr 2010,40,"Great Hotel, poor location.....",I stayed three nights at the Kenzi Menara Palace as part of my Imperial Cities tour booked with Italian Tour operator Francorosso. The hotel is advised as 5 stars I fully agree with this. The Hotel in a new building built in 2009. Room are very spacious like the bathroom. Both bedrooms and bathroom are very well kept and very clean. In the room you have a big Samsung TV and a great entertainment system free of charge in part provided by the Hotel. Staff is very polite in the whole hotel. In my opinion the breakfast was too poor for a 5 stars hotel I have seen others 4 stars hotels with a better choice. We had some dinners and lunches at the main restaurant: I have to admit that the food was very good (I was surprised of this) especially when the restaurant had “à la carte” selection but also the buffet was ok. The hotel is close to the famous club Pacha that can be reached in 5 minutes on foot. My only remark is the location: the hotel is the new part of Marrakech so it takes about 10-15 minutes by bus to reach the “Place Djemaa el Fna”. I don’t have an exactly idea of the price for a room for a night since I booked a tour and the price of the hotel was part of the price for the tour but I read in the room in the low season costs 3000 Dirham equal to about EUR 300. I recommend this hotel if then someone like our case brings you the city centre of Marrakech. Next time will try a riad in the heart of the Medina….,Date of stay: March 2010,,"Paradiso, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Athens85

Kenzi Menara Palace,BunglesMemoirs wrote a review Mar 2010,10,Overpriced/Tired Decor/Deceitful Staff/Greedy Owner/Middle of No-Where,The stay: We hired four rooms. (1) The security was questionable none of the patio doors locked. Hence at night there was risk of anyone easily breaking an entry while you were in bed. God help you if you had children. The maintenance people tried to fix the doors but each time came unstuck. We were moved each timed being assured that the doors were fixed. We were close to moving hotels. (2) The staff were terrible receptionists constantly averting their gazes and pretending to be on the phone when asked a question as they couldnt speak english. As soon as you left the room you would find room service hovering around the door to check if you'd used the mini-bar. BEWARE dont use the coffee/tea maker you are charged a fortune to heat up the water in the new-fangled kettle and drink the rather acrid coffee pod drinks. Unlike the UK common o garden hotels even where the tea and coffee are complimentary. The concierge is sweet guy but is on the take. He organises trips out of the city and stakes a % on top which he claims at the end of your stay from the drivers. The managerial staff (esp the finance guy) are a shambles they wouldnt relax the charges for the assumed complientary 'hot water' and tea bags!    (3) The facilites around the poolside are quite treacherous with loose paving slabs and poor poolside bar staff attendance who were smoking or eating their own wares.  (4) The location is terrible its miles from anywhere with no real methodology as to why it was sited in such a remote non-descript location. Master planners nightmare.  (5) The people as a whole are friendly enough in the villages but beware of inflated prices for fake goods.  (6) For: Berber villages/Fantasia (tourist tat but fun).

Kenzi Menara Palace,NeilW9616 wrote a review Jan 2010,50,Outstanding hotel,The hotel is situated in suburbs of Marrakech so a taxi is best way into town althought there is a hotel shuttle but runs at set times which may not fit in with your timings. The staff are very friendly and always willing to help. The hotel is newly built and in typical Morrocaan style. The rooms are large and well furnished. The facilties are fantastic especially the spa. The outdoor swimming pool was being renovated during our stay but it would have been too windy to use anyway. The restuarnts are good serving european & morocaan food.

The pool area was exceptional although I thought it strange that the tiles in the pool had started to deteriorate after sucht a short time. The Morrocan restaurant was of poor quality and not worth going to we had a much better meal in Marrakesh. The buffet breakfast was very good and the hotel were happy for us to check out after 4pm for no extra charge. With regards to the location it was convenient for the airport about 15 mins in a taxi and about 15 mins from Marrakesh which was fine. Yes a taxi was about 50 dhirams but I didnt find that excesssive.

Kenzi Menara Palace,Bustagut_9 wrote a review Dec 2009,30,"Fantastic Staff, Good Building, Poor and Expensive Restaurant",This is a new and luxurious hotel. We booked late and were rewarded with a fantatstic room. The pool and suroundings were superb but even so given the surroundings 125 MAD for two beers was excessive. The staff were great and helpful.    The restaurants were not up to the standard of the rest of the hotel. The breakfast was good although insisting on service on the terrace (open to the cold air ) was really not acceptable in November. There are two restaurants in the hotel but the menu for either did not change in the nine days that we were there. We were there there for the Festival of the ID (Abraham sacrifcing a sheep instead of Jacob) and the food in the hotel ( a buffet diiner) was worse than usual but more expensive.    Dinner on the terrace was cold despite the four patio heaters and the insistence that guests need to sit in the open air on a late November evening is putting ambience in front of comfort..    In general the hotel restaurants are expensive without being exclusive. The Moroccan restaurant is best avoided - you can do much better in town    If you don't have a car I wouldn't stay here. It is a long way out of town and taxis are 40 MAD to the central square and 50 MAD to Gueliz.    Overall a very pleasant modern hotel which has not reacted to the credit crunch and the fact that is so far out of town. So adverised and subsidised transport into town would have been a partial solution,Date of stay: November 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Northampton,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bustagut_9
Kenzi Menara Palace,sarah118 wrote a review Dec 2009,50,WOW!,This hotel was absolutely fantastic! From the moment we arrived everything was perfect. The rooms are huge with beautiful decor and the beds are absolutely enormous! We had a great view from our balcony onto the pool though I do realise that some balconies will look straight onto the dual carriageway if they face the front think we were just lucky. Found the staff lovely though there was a little bit of a language barrier with the room service staff but was sorted out with no problem after a little charades! The food at the poolside bar was beautiful but not exactly cheap. The staff at this bar were lovely and attentive but not invasive.    The location was good too only 15 minutes from the airport so very convenient.    I absolutely recommend this hotel and can't believe some of the review that I have read are the same place!

Kenzi Menara Palace,CygnusBergen wrote a review Nov 2009,30,Mixed feelings,We did enjoy the hotel at first even though we felt cheated - the description had suggested we were right outside the city walls! Still the room was nice - even though the view wasn't great (actually the highway). The first day breakfast was nice too - later it deteriorated (warm dishes cold-to-cool) probably because more guests arrived? The worst thing was however what happened when I ended up in the hospital (a serious allergy attack) in the morning the day we were scheduled to leave - while the hotel doctor and we were waiting for the ambulance the person on duty promised that of course the room could be kept - when my husband returned (I was still very ill so he was naturally in shock) he was told that the hotel was full and he was made to pack there and there. When he protested and pointed out that this was both cruel and unacceptable they did finally relent a little and found a hotel room for him in town. Naturally our feelings are coloured by this unpleasant episode. So would we recommend the hotel - I don't know!,Date of stay: October 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bergen, Norway",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CygnusBergen
Kenzi Menara Palace,pan40 wrote a review Nov 2009,30,Nice hotel but very expensive extras,Good points:  New lovely rooms and public areas staff polite concierge fantastic at arranging taxis getting us picked up etc huge pool quiet food freshly cooked.  Not so good:  Prices of drinks etc glass of wine €7-9 coke €350 extra costs taxes.  We booked two rooms both 1 adult  2 children. Half board the poolside lunch we tried for two plates of pasta 3 chips 6 cokes came to €60 !! this is one expensive way to live.  So we spent our time cost saving only one drink at each meal it still came to €25 per meal on top of half board.  The dinner service was so slow with only 5 tables occupied  it took sometimes 1 hour to get starters half hour for main and 20 mins for ice creams so no matter how fast we ate or ordered each meal took two hours and with children it was not a good experience as the restaurant opened at 7.30  so we were never out before 9.30.  The worst bit was check out when we got a bill for an additional €1200 euros !!! Despite the fact the fact our booking was confirmed by the travel company ( I had copies of the confirmations) at 1 adult + 2 children per room  they wanted to charge us additionally for the fold out bed in each room at €45 per room per night = €630 ! After half an hour at the desk and phone calls to the holiday company it got waived somehow.  We still had a bill for €550 for our cost saving drink regime by the time they added room taxes and a couple of pool lunches.  We also lost a pair of my daughters €30 crocs from the room so do a personal inventory check each day of your room. I had been really careful to put everything in the safe but shoes?.  So only stay if you really can afford it otherwise like us you spend the time scrimping sharing bottled water etc.,Date of stay: November 2009,Trip type: Traveled with family,uk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pan40
Kenzi Menara Palace,EnglandFran wrote a review Oct 2009,20,not what I expected,Just returned fromv a visit to Kenzi Menara Palace. The rooms were very large and attractive. towels and sheets changed daily as you would expect from a hotel of this standard however the hotel was either very quiet almost dead some evenings or on other occassions full of conference people who ran around at all hours of the night banging doors etc. The restaurant service was slow although breakfast was quite varied and fairly good. As we had booked half board both restaurants in the evening had very limited menus. My husband suffers from a nut allergy and although we explained this at every meal his food constantly came covered in nuts. The food in the Moroccan restaurant was of a very poor quality and was often inedible. We have just returned home feeling unwell having paid a fortune for our stay. I cannot recomment the restaurants in this hotel as we are now having to undergo tests to discover the nature of  our stomach infections.,Date of stay: October 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,England,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EnglandFran
Kenzi Menara Palace,Mari05London wrote a review Sep 2009,40,"Good hotel, especially if you like peace and quiet",I stayed in this hotel with my daughter for a week. Newly finished great surroundings wonderful 50mt long pool (there were very few tourists during our stay and we often had the pool all to ourselves). Staff were all very nice especially in the restaurants although receptionists could have stepped up their game a bit. We can absolutely recommend the restaurant in the hotel (the continental one we did not try the traditional one) the food was fantastic and good value for money - but the choice is a bit limited. Room service was good too but again a bit limited (tagine nice). The only gripe is the water from the minibar was VERY expensive (10 times more than in town) I would suggest that at the first opportunity you buy a few bottles whilst you are out and about. Overall great quiet place 10 minutes away from central Marrakesh but that's fine if you are looking for peace and quiet. We were disappointed by the spa we tried the scrub but would not have it done again but you get to use the multi sensory multi coloured indoor pool and that's great.,Date of stay: September 2009,,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mari05London

Kenzi Menara Palace,RickS_MK wrote a review Aug 2009,50,A real treat,Arrived for 1 night stay without booking in advance. Was treated to a very friendly chat and free tea in comfortable lounge before I had agreed to stay. Was afraid that I was going to have to leave after that because the level of luxury convinced me I was out of my league. Very surprised to find it was only 1100DH (£80). Agreed to treat ourselves to 1 night of luxury but eventually stayed 5 days.    Staff very friendly and helpful especially the concierge and the head waiter. All staff would greet you whenever they saw you and most spoke reasonable English.    Hotel is very modern only opened in March 2009. Rooms are set in 6 three-storey blocks arranged around the pool. The pool is set in pleasant gardens and is a huge 50m x 25m over 55m if you include the integral children's pool. Free comfortable sun loungers with large umbrellas and towels brought to you as you arrive. The pool is first class by any standards and is the hotel's best feature. If you don't plan using it there are probably better hotel choices available to you. The pool is large enough to never be crowded. Poolside bar serves food and drinks but is quite expensive.    Rooms are large modern and well equipped with very little Moroccan styling. Air Conditioning Flat Screen TV Mini Bar Safe balcony/patio with table and chairs are all included. Bathrooms are superb and include bath shower cubicle toilet and bidet - the toilet even has a telephone. Hairdryers and free toiletries provided of course.    Included breakfast has enormous choice and there is a Moroccan and an International restaurant. Had one meal in the International restaurant. Food was good with fairly small portions but served with style. Main courses were 90dh to 180dh.    Extras were quite expensive - Minibar was 40dh for a small water coffee/tea were provided but cost extra snacks at poolside bar were 90dh internet 35dh per 30 minutes. Spa not tested.    The one drawback is the remoteness. The whole area is being developed but so far only a few hotels a night club and a cinema have been completed. There is no bus service and it is not possible to walk into town (3 km) in the July heat. Nearest shop is about 1.5km away. Taxis cost 50dh each way but many taxi drivers don't know where the hotel is - so carry a map memorize the address and make sure they don't take you to the wrong Kenzi hotel.,Date of stay: July 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Matlock, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RickS_MK

I was travelling with my family (6 people total) and decided to stay at this hotel due to the fact that was recently opened.  On one hand the hotel is great superb rooms very large ones (we stay at the suites) lovely pool very courteous service decent food.  On the other it is far from everything and surrounded by nothing apart from the discotheque Pacha.  The service is slow as in many other places in the city but once you get used to the speed is good. English was not a problem as most of them speak it well.  What is not understandable is that being a new hotel and surrounded by nothing there is not a shuttle bus to the city center even more taking a taxi was a bit painful and takes time (15 minutes minimum).  The fitness room was very nice but opens at 900 and the charge for using it something really that I do not understand in a place of that category.  There are things that clearly have to be corrected but overall I had a great time at Marrakech and definitely I recommend a quite hotel with the maximum luxury to relax from the daily activity.

We were shown to our 3 rooms which had lots of minor niggly faults and were moved to better rooms.  The management were very well meaning and tried hard to placate us but we stayed here 6 months too early .It was quite clear that other guests had similar niggling problems and the overall impression we left with was that this is a very expensive hotel that failed to live up to its promise or potential.  We would not return to the hotel but will certainly not reurn to Marrakech.
