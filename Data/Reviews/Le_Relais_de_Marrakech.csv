Le Relais de Marrakech,JazzySkylar wrote a review Mar 5,20,OK for campers but avoid if you think you are staying in Marrakech,"Positives: nice pool and restaurant with good food although drinks very expensive.  Negatives:location is about 20 minutes from old city no bus so have to use taxi at around £10 each way £15 at night so cheap accomodation becomes rather expensive. Nothing in local area to see just scrubland and stray dogs. Mainly a site for camper vans but there are rooms and tents. We had a room: reasonable size but most uncomfortable lumpy double bed - terrible back ache. The worst part was our ""en-suite bathroom"" - corner of the room curtained off with a shower that in 3 days never gave us hot water despite reporting it a sink that was constantly blocked and never cleared (I wont go into details) 1 tiny threadbare towel. So close to our bed that on getting the inevitable dicky tummy to save our embarrassment i had to send my poor partner outside in the middle of the night. You have to use the restaurant as the site ""shop"" sells barely more than water and bread and no where to prepare your own food anyway and there are no other shops nearby within walking distance. So pleased we had 3 days in a beautiful riad in the medina otherwise would have left with a very negative view on marrakech.",Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Ringwood, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JazzySkylar
Le Relais de Marrakech,Walidmario wrote a review Sep 2020,30,Nice pool,My British girlfriend and I spent one night in this camping was nice pool and nice garden rooms were very hot and inside they have so much ants. There are signs around the pool stating that Muslim woman cannot wear burkinis in or around the pool. Not a bad shower with hot water the toilet had no door. We asked the girl in reception about us having one room but she said we can’t have one room because we are not married but she said that she can give us second room with 10€ more and we can stay in the one room. There is a ping pong table and a bar near the enterance and hammocks and seats with tables there is also a park for children and a volleyball net. There are chickens and ducks that roam around on the grass and near the pool but they are very friendly and will not disturb anyone. Anyway we will back!!,Date of stay: September 2020,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Marrakech, Morocco",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/walidmario

Le Relais de Marrakech,brit933 wrote a review Dec 2018,40,Very good place but a lot of waiting time,The restaurant is situated close to the all inclusive hotel Sangho. The food is good with a choise og Morrocon plates and more European food. Priced are in the middle range. The problem is that is is the only restaurant in the neighbourhood of the hotel so it is the only option for hotel guests who don’t have all inclusive. We waited an hour and a half for our dinner at one occation,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Solbjerg, Denmark",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brit933
Le Relais de Marrakech,FZ E wrote a review Oct 2018,10,The Worst and dangerous place ever,I came with my friends to enjoy the weekend on our tents untill all a sudden there was a huge innondation that changed our weekend to a night mare. The worst part of the story all is that allthe employees of thé hôtel not even the managers were here to save peoples lives.we were frightened because noone came to turn off the light.they promised to fix our cars that were damaged in this incident as well as our materials but then they changed their minds and fooled us.this zone is a risky place and they dont have a valid insurrance.

Le Relais de Marrakech,IaMaudella wrote a review Jun 2018,50,This is the life,Nomad tent Kasbar or just camping. Excellent rates. Great hospitality. Sun morning to night. No restrictions laid back and general holiday mode day by day.  Mainly French language spoken.  Menu limited but adequate and available day & night good service.  Plenty of area’s to play watch tv swim eat or do nothing.

Le Relais de Marrakech,franglaise2018 wrote a review Feb 2018,20,Our third visit in the last five years and looking forward to a relaxing stay,Sadly this is a campsite that has lost it's way. It is some three years since we were last here and I believe it is under new ownership or management. I did ask to speak to an owner on two occasions but was not able to do so. It is not quite clear who is running the Relais but the long term French camper residents certainly have the upper hand. They feel that they can behave as they wish. intimidate and provoke at will if their behaviour is challenged. It was made very clear to me by the sychophantic staff at reception that they ( the long termers ) were more important than ourselves. So take down your signs and rules because it is 'do as you please' at the Relais - as long as the dirhams are coming over the counter. Very very disappointed. Shame on you.,Date of stay: February 2018,,"Rabat, Morocco",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/franglaise2018
Le Relais de Marrakech,Katrin wrote a review Jan 2018,40,Would recommend,Very nice rooms well decorated and with AC heating good sized bathroom although mirrors are a bit low for European tourists. Bed was good and they have beer in the bar.

Le Relais de Marrakech,Hamza B wrote a review Nov 2016,40,Relaxing hospitable environment,"Arriving late at night the night shift agent was welcoming while checking us in with a pleasant smile.  Our specific room had a large king size bed with two small beds along the sides of the wall (capable of accommodating a minimum of 4).    The next morning the sun was up and shining while we took a tasty breakfast (choice of different tea/coffee or other) along with a ""msamen"" (a delicious Moroccan specialty) with bread jam and butter. This typical Marrakech breakfast was served in front of a nice pool surrounded with Moroccan trees by very gentle and smiling waitresses throughout our stay.    The day front-desk agent was a hospitable sweet French lady who was responsible for checkin/check out along with different reservations for nearby events.    The room was decent with a comfortable bed along with requested additional covers.    This hotel also accommodates different people from outside Morocco who travel in their large minivans. They have a big parking spot where they could park and be ""at home in their minivans"" with many bathrooms available.    The night agent/security person was always present at any time of the night big smile and friendly manners.    Overall conclusion I was a satisfied guest and will return in the near future. The price is very reasonable for a hotel stay in Marrakech.

Le Relais de Marrakech,Rickcs wrote a review Oct 2016,40,An excellent site with most helpful staff,Using this site regularly en route to the south it is a tribute to the vision of its French developers; with no real competition. Imaginatively designed with a full range of accommodation and facilities it is highly to be recommended.  Not easily to be located down a little-marked track it is showing some wear and tear; to be expected given quality and popularity.  Specifically this time we'd had serious vehicle problems. Arriving tired and late after a long and difficult journey the restaurant was kept open for us with good food wine and kindness. Also a recovery truck was arranged within 30 minutes.

Le Relais de Marrakech,Mizkei wrote a review Jan 2016,50,Nice place outside Marrakech if you travel with your own vehicle,We slept in one of the Berber tents for one night. They are spacious and have their own private bathroom with hot water. Our tent was clean and we got fresh towels but remember to bring your own soap. There's no aircondition/heating included in the price but you can get one apparently if you want to. The tent has its own smell - we had to get used to that. The camping has a very nice and well-kept pool and garden area with hammocks and deckchairs trees and flowers. The staff is helpful and friendly. We didn't want to drive into Marrakech for dinner so we ate at the restaurant there. The fireplace was burning and it created a nice and cozy atmosphere. The food was alright but for Morocco it seemed a little overpriced. You can order alcoholic drinks there - the beer comes in very small bottles (25 cl). We were a little sad that it was too cold to try out the pool but maybe next time.,Date of stay: January 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Radolfzell am Bodensee, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mizkei

Le Relais de Marrakech,Catjane2610 wrote a review Nov 2015,40,Great stop for a relaxing few days,We stopped off here by chance wanting somewhere to camp near the centre of Marrakech. Driving in we saw the pool gym facilities and were greeted by very friendly reception staff. The price was very reasonable (camping non electric for us but can be provided) and the little bungalows they had looked lovely. We didn't eat at the restaurant but it looked and smelt good you could buy coffees and other drinks (including alcoholic) for a reasonable price. Wifi was free by the pool and restaurant area.  The facilities were fantastic hot water and roomy showers. Toilets were clean however remember to take own soap and toilet paper.  Staff were lovely and always willing to help!  Taxis could be arranged by the reception staff to go into Marrakech for very little as well as the local supermarket.  We stayed here longer than we had planned due to it being such a nice place.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Bicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Catjane2610

The restaurant fairly good food and is a lovely place to spend an evening. All the staff are extremely helpful friendly and have great sense of humour. After staying in a Riad in Medina which was great but returning to the peace of Le Relais was great.  Will definitely be going back and probably the best campsite in Morroco.,Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Brighton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/628ruthf

Le Relais de Marrakech,Vincent123123 wrote a review Jun 2014,40,Good camping with nice location,This camping was the least quiet one we visited on our morocco trip. camper vans stand right next to each other. fortunately there were some spots a bit to the side where it was less busy. Pool area is nice but a bit crowded. Location is about 15 min by car from Gueliz the ville nouvelle of Marrakech. Staff were a bit hit and miss. When we arrived there was no one at reception and one of the employees who saw us just walked by and didnt seem to care. i had to get her in the end while she was talking with her colleague. then she came with me to reception and when she found out there was no one there she said Oh just put your tent somewhere and that was that and she wanted to leave again. We had to call her back because we wanted to ask for prices rules etc..anyway a nice camping if you can find a quiet spot and if you like the pool but dont comr here for a warm welcome and a quiet atmosphere.,Date of stay: May 2014,,"Leiden, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vincent123123
Le Relais de Marrakech,hoppywendy wrote a review May 2014,30,French campsite of choice,We were in the tiny minority of being 2 English campers amongst about 50 French and a smattering of other nationalities. The pitch markings are indistinct so one can find oneself with a very close neighbour! Showers could be hot if you picked your time of day (8:30am was good). The pool area was lovely and the restaurant clean and friendly with fair food and free wifi (in return for a drink). It has a very relaxed atmosphere and is some distance from the busy road. However there are downsides to being relaxed in that there was always the possibility of standing in something gooey deposited by the many dogs owned by campers and the dustbins seemed to be always overflowing.,Date of stay: December 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Aylesbury, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hoppywendy
Le Relais de Marrakech,Benny T wrote a review Mar 2014,20,235 motorhomes + 20 tents = 6 showers,"And when you want to know why there is no hot water the answer makes you feel stupid : ""Y'a trop de monde voyez pas ?"" (Too many people can't you see ?).  At Drh115 a night this is one of the dearest and yet very little service for money. No toilet paper not cleaned as often as it should horrible smell of sewer around the sanitary bloc due to the submerged service area.  If you plan to use the specially negotiated taxi service be aware : the Drh60 applies only from 9am to 6pm and for a direct non stop trip to the ""Artisanal Craft Centre"". Of course!!!. Any modification even if you ask to be dropped down on the way will result in ""Free rates"" i.e. anything from 120 to Drh300.

Le Relais de Marrakech,Henry H wrote a review Dec 2013,40,A Christmas to remember!,I recently visited my father who is staying at this campsite in Marrakech on his world travels. I've stayed in many campsites and I was blown away with the pool area facilities. I spent most of my time in a hammock using their free wifi.  I was also amazed how friendly everyone was. It had a lovely community spirit.  One tip when the site is busy get to the showers early in the morning as you might have a cold shower!

Le Relais de Marrakech,lionmusicman wrote a review Dec 2013,50,I visited this place twice in the month i was in Morocco,I had booked just a couple of nights online and arrived quite early in the morning... I'd travelled thru the night from a very busy City of Fez.. So at Le relais de Marrakech was great to kick back and enjoy a bit of peace and quiet after the busy nature of Marrakech Medina and the Souks...  Once you've done your sight seeing your buying and endless haggling you can feel just a little frayed so very nice to go back to an oasis of quiet...  The staff were very helpful... The pool area is beautiful... there is a Jacuzzi too... Massages can be well recommended ( 3 x 30 minute massages for 300 dirhams.. I ate at the restaurant several evening times too... good food at a reasonable price... breakfast is a simple breakfast but is value for money ( £2.20 - €2.80 - 30 dirhams )  I arranged a quad bike experience and the people they use are of a high standard with new machines... Great value...  I had a 6 day stay and had a Chambre / room which was just used by myself but it would have been the same price if up to 3 people shared it.. ( £20 - €24 - 270 Dirhams )  I then journeyed on to Agadir and Essaueira and decided to return back there again for 3 nights camping... Great place to visit if you want a peaceful option to seeing Marrakech..,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Faro, Portugal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lionmusicman
Le Relais de Marrakech,Thomas L wrote a review Sep 2013,40,Perfect place to find rest amid Marrakech's noisy centre,Relais de Marrakech is that typical place where you don't expect the perfect place (the roadsigns leading to the camping are very limited) yet where you find your very own Moroccan fata morgana. The pool is very nice surrounded by green foliage and excellent beds to relax. The restaurant offers a typical Moroccan menu as well as some international dishes (pasta pizza etc.) and alcohol which is not to be found a lot in Morocco. It has splendid tents for hire which are fully equipped (though we took the camping). Sanitation is proper the owner is friendly and even washes your laundry for (if I remember correctly) free.

Le Relais de Marrakech,Aisling F wrote a review Jan 2013,50,Excellent place,We have just returned to Ireland following a years trip around Europe and North Africa in our campervan. We liked this place so much that we returned here a second time on our trip and recommended it to friends who came to Marrakech for a short trip and stayed with us at Le Relais in the Kasbah while we were in stayed at one of the campervan sites. The array of different accomodation here is excellent and suits all types of travellers. The grounds are beautifully kept and really pretty. We found this to be the best campsite we stayed in during our entire 2.5 months travelling around Morocco. Facilities are excellent and very clean with a lovely pool area. We were able to rent a car easily for a day trip and the staff arranged for the car to be delivered to and collected from the campsite for a very reasonable price. The campsite is a little far away from shops etc. but the restaurant is very good and the Marjane supermarket is a short/cheap taxi drive away there is also a small shop just outside the campsite who are able to provide the basics such as fresh bread eggs milk water ciggies etc the man that runs this shop is also very accomodating and will go and get any extras that you might need such as veg and herbs if you ask him. We found the staff and management to be very friendly and our friends were upgraded to two rooms instead of one with no extra charge. The pricing is fair. Altogether we found Le Relais de Marrakech to be an excellent base for visiting the wonderful city of Marrakech.,Date of stay: January 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Limerick, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AislingF_13

Le Relais de Marrakech,missfranbo wrote a review Jul 2010,10,Looks are deceptive,We arrived late to the campsite on 13/07/2010 and was greeted my the very lovely Mohammed the night guardian. We set up the tent and thought we had landed in paradise... nice pool jacuzzi and lush greenness. Along with Mohammed there is a really nice helpful girl who was there at breakfast ready with coffee and a smile.    We were the only people there in a tent... all the other customers had there own campervans or were staying in the permanent tents on site. As we only had a tent we relied a lot on the on-site facilities ie. the cafe/restaurant spending a lot of money as just a bottle of water cost 20DH = £1.50. It was so hot in the tent as there is no shade provided that we had to buy everything on site where as those with vans had there own food supply and fridges (essential in Morocco!).    There are 2 French women working in the camping who were incredibly rude. One complained whenever we went to the bar with a note rather than small change... I said that she had all my change that we had been spending money all day... she huffed and puffed and eventually threw my change across the bar at me. Strange when I am giving her money.    On the 16th it was my birthday. It was a hot day and going to the centre of Marrakech seemed too far so we went to the restaurant there. You have to order a tagine the day before! so we ended up having turkey curry as there was very little choice. It took nearly 1 hour to arrive. I went up to the bar several times to ask where it was. The lady behind the counter seemed quite stoned/drunk and eventually emerged with the curry giggling while apologising that she had forgot it was waiting in the kitchen... it was stone cold. I took it back they put it in the microwave after poking it a few times with their fingers. I wait for 5 mins... it comes out... it is still cold. I give up hope... but it is my birthday and besides that I am hungry. So I try to eat half my husband can't face any of it. Good for him as after that dreaded night I was ill for what felt like the rest of my stay (2 weeks). But maybe that was just a bad night... so we try the mixed grill of meatballs kebab etc the next day. My husband found electric blue pieces of stuff in his meatballs... maybe some kind of magic potion the cook had added for good measure.    On complaining we received contemptuous looks and a demand for the money... which is way over priced for the standard of food. So I paid over the odds to be given food poisoning.    The third night there was a massive storm. It went from 49 degree heat to hail stones and monsoon rain for hours. We asked the women working there if it was normal... oh yes it's normal. So I ask the question if this is a normal occurance why hadn't the owners thought of drainage for the site. The whole area where campervans were was flooded... you had to waid through the water to get anywhere. And of course there was no drainage where our tent was... and it was completely flooded inside and out. Everything ruined. So it was the last night in Marrakech lets treat ourselves to one of the permanent nomadic tents on the site. We had no choice anyway so we move and the nomadic tent is so smelly it is hard to stay inside for more than a few minutes the aroma thick with damp... the tent full of various insects... the sheets dirty... in every way unpleasant.    Next day after very little sleep we go to the reception the lady has no simpathy for our flooded tent and charges us full price for the use of the horrid nomadic tent. The female owner is also in reception; no 'how was your stay' or anything... she sees the money in my husbands hand and grabs it like it is the first water she has seen in three days while lost in the sahara.    I am not sure if the mistreatment of my husband and I was slight racism or... I have no idea. The French women that worked there would drool over the french clientele while I as an English women and my husband as a North African were treated with absolute contempt.    On leaving Marrakech we took a coach to Oualidia (on the coast) a good 4 hours away. The price for the journey was the same as the campsite's resident taxi driver charges for a one way ride to the centre of Marrakech (60DH = £4.50)! - supposedly 15 mins away. We found other taxi drivers to take us back and they charged 10DH.    The site looks great and the Moroccan guardian and the young lady doing breakfast are the creme de la creme... but the managment is absolutely disgusting. They are money grabbing to the exteme while having no customer service skills and no substance behind the facade. They pay their Moroccan staff pitance (£75/month) while earning massive amount of euros daily. They are lucky that they're the only campsite left in Marrakech. Such a shame it makes you want to open your own site where customers and staff are treated with respect.,Date of stay: July 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/missfranbo
