Definitely Very friendly helpful & polite staff which made all the difference and specially the pool staff !! Fantastic array of food at breakfast and each meal.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Lesley M wrote a review Mar 18,40,Amazing,I have just returned from this hotel. Having spent 10 nights there. The room was fantastic very clean. The hotel was lovely and very clean. The restaurant food was amazing. Had a very large choice but some of it was cold. Breakfast time was very busy as a lot of golfers go there so those to take all the rolls and the bread with Chuck don‚Äôt understand why the hotel as it‚Äôs all-inclusive should provide a packed lunch for them. Also they should have a couple of coffee and tea stations which would take a bit of pressure off of the staff even though they were all fantastic. Keep having to go back and forward. Get in the teas and coffee is in the cups Would make life a bit easier and also I found some evenings they would let people still in their swimwear which is clearly states you cannot go in there in shorts and bikinis. Obviously lunchtime it‚Äôs a bit different but obviously you put a T-shirt or no shorts. We used to sit round the large games pool every day which there was plenty of activities. All the staff there were amazing Emma Sami Titif Oussami who was especially brilliant got a sunbeds every day brought round water to us all when it was really hot which was every day. I will definitely be returning to this hotel next year.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lesleymB9565OV
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Sue M wrote a review Mar 18,50,Amazing hotel with brilliant staff,Just returned after a fantastic 10 nights at this lovely hotel. We had a large room overlooking the pool on the ground floor which was lovely and cleaned every day with fresh towels and the beds were so comfortable.  The restaurant and food were good with a great choice to suit everyone but could do with being hotter we ended up going to the fresh pasta station at the evening to make sure we had hit food. The desserts are delicious and the best I‚Äôve eaten in an all inclusive hotel. Breakfast is frustrating and chaotic as the hotel is a base for the golfers who take over the restaurant first thing and take all the rolls and bread to make sandwiches to take with them the staff are run off their feet and you have to wait for the table to be cleaned then they bring the coffee tea but run out of cups so you have to wait again for them to fetch these. A suggestion would be to take the pressure of the staff to install a couple of self service tea and coffee machines.    What makes this hotel one of the best holidays I‚Äôve had is the staff around the pool Titus Emma Sami and especially Oussami who went out of his way every day to get fresh towels for us and put umbrellas by our sun beds even bringing us bottles of water in the 32 degrees heat. All the team were great fun to be around and we had a great time doing all the activities and met some lovely people.    I would definitely recommend this hotel and hope to return next year.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Crawley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suemF6375WC
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Rachel C wrote a review Mar 17,40,Good for price but not a 5*,I always try to start these reviews with some info about me as a traveller to help others decide if my preferences and tastes align with theirs to enable easier decision making. I am in my late 30‚Äôs and holiday a minimum of twice a year. I am fortunate that I can splash out and stay in some beautiful places in exotic parts of the world but am equally happy to seek out a bargain if it means I can see different parts of the world.    This holiday was a girls week away with the intention of catching some winter sun food and cocktails. We paid under ¬£500 a person for all inclusive inc flights    THE HOTEL    The hotel itself is kept very clean you are welcomed with beautiful incense smells as you arrive. The layout is easy to navigate and small. There are two pools one with a swim up bar and one which is ‚Äòheated‚Äô and where the animation team are based during the day. There are a few sunloungers that need to be replaced as they bow in the middle but on a whole all furnishings and fittings are clean and tidy. The gardens are well kept and aesthetically pleasing.    Plenty of Sun loungers hotel quiet and I was often the only person by the pool until 10-10.30 am.    Location is around 20 minutes away from Marrakesh and there is a free shuttle provided.    THE ROOM    We paid for a basic room with two beds. Room again was clean and pleasant enough beds were very comfortable but pillows not. Mini fridge contained only of water and was not cold. There was a kettle and 2 coffee capsules.  Plenty of hanging space and hangers.    Very strange window from bathroom into the bedroom we found this funny and you could draw a blind for privacy. Bath could not be used as no plug. Shower weak needed a descale but cubicle big and clean. Shower did drip all the time. Two sinks and some tolietries provided which we didn‚Äôt use. Only provided with one big towel and a hand towel which was not great for long thick hair. Hair dryer was not great for a supposed 5* but normal standard for price paid    We were on ground floor and there was a small area to sit outside. It overlooked a wall and little bit of garden.    The room was cleaned every day to a good standard. The cleaners are an asset to this hotel as are the other housekeeping team such as maintenance and gardeners. Clean towels provided each day.    FOOD    The hotel is greatly let down by its food. I am a real foodie and love spending money on food and drink. I am reviewing this based on the price we paid but I was very disappointed.    Food is served in a buffet style. It is very small and the layout is not easy to navigate. I could always find something to eat but noticed the food was very bland with lots of salt used if it was left over from lunch.    There were items of food that were not warm when they should have been and this made them inedible. I normally do not have a sweet tooth however the pastry chef was very talented here and deserts were fantastic.    Once a week you could book to eat in the other sit down restaurant. You have to be spending 4 nights plus to access this. The food was much better but very small menu. I wished there had been an option to pay to eat in this restaurant as I would have used it over the restaurant.    For lunch you could order food at the pool bar which was hot as it was cooked to order.    Waiting staff were ok some friendly others not so.    DRINKS    My friend said she liked the beer as she thought it tasted like corona. The cocktails were very poor as made with cordials and not juices very sweet and syrupy. I can be a lightweight in the heat and feel tipsy quickly if I am not careful‚Ä¶.I did not experience this at all as alcohol very watered down. Again for the price paid this was ok but not 5* standard. There is no option to buy better wines unless you were in the sit down restaurant and these did not look great for the price.    The bar staff in the lobby bar were fab very efficient kind and good service provided bring drinks to you.    Pool bar we only used once so can not comment we did not use the sports bar but the snack bar had poorer quality of staff service. Very rare to get a smile.    ENTERTAINMENT    Evening entertainment was ok for price paid. Some singers a disco dancers etc. they had karaoke which is not my personal favourite but was very popular.    The animation team by the ‚Äòheated‚Äô pool were an asset to the hotel. Emma and Sami spent the most time with us but all the team provided 10/10 service.    SUSTAINABILITY    Whilst I am not an eco warrior I have started to consider the environmental sustainability of hotels I stay in. This was not great for sustainable models. Very small plastic cups bottles straws used. Plastic cutlery at snack bar.    SPA    The spa was ok pleasing on the eye and clean. Treatments were mediocre but only cost 700 mad for a full massage and additional head massage so reasonably priced    OVERALL    We paid for what we got. I would rate this as a high end 3* to low end 4*. I was surprised we had wrist bands had towel cards had to pay room and towel deposits of 1000 mad as this is not expected in a five star hotel. The food and drinks are what would move this down to a 3* I‚Äôm my opinion.    The ages of guests ranged but there was a high percentage of young influencers around the hotel which may be why some of the reviews lean towards a false impression of five star standards.    Would I come back? Unlikely. Would I have been happy if I had paid a five star price for this holiday ‚Ä¶.NO. If you are paying over 500 GBP at this hotel at this time of year for a week then you are paying way too much in my opinion.    The staff (most) are what makes this hotel    My expectations of 5* differ greatly from the hotel and this would make me cautious booking an expensive holiday with this hotel chain worldwide.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L1291HJrachelc
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Shirley-Rose wrote a review Mar 16,50,Amazing Holiday and Hotel,We had such an amazing holiday here. The hotel was gorgeous immaculate and so relaxing. The staff were amazing and so friendly. We spent a lot of our time around the quiet pool and honestly so thankful we did. Omar and Osama were absolutely amazing so friendly and welcoming and made us feel at home. The food was lovely for each meal and the chef were so helpful and friendly. Honestly will go back again and again. My only tiny issue was we booked a spa package still to this day I'm not sure if we ended up missing part of our massage the staff were lovely and the session we did have were amazing but I felt that you were left to figure out if you needed to wait or not for you next part of the sessions. I believe we were due to have a clay massage but never had it because we were just pointed to the end of the corridor. However everything else was absolutely fantastic and I can't thank the staff enough so a wonderful week.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShirlDuff18
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Linda H wrote a review Mar 15,50,Amazing adult only hotel,The hotel was lovely the rooms are big & clean. The food & drink was fresh hot and varied. The grounds are beautiful and well looked after. The staff are attentive friendly and good fun the activities around the pool are there if you want to take part. The evening singers & dancers were really good and aimed at an adult audience. We went as a group of 8 girls we had an amazing time and will definitely return one day.  Thank you to all the staff for accommodating our group with seating in the restaurant and sitting outside in the evening we never went without and they always had a friendly smile üòÉ,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Bishop's Waltham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindahud30
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Molly M wrote a review Mar 14,50,Fantastic Hotel - We Will Return,I can quite honestly say this is one of the best resorts I‚Äôve stayed at with the nicest atmosphere. The hotel is constantly being cleaned smelling amazing and all the cleaning/housekeeping staff were so happy and friendly. The staff in the pool bar were always very friendly and kept our drinks refilled frequently as well as providing some great food including late breakfasts. Tariq especially was very hard working and friendly. The restaurant buffet was possibly the best I‚Äôve experienced and yes whilst any buffet gets a bit same over seven days the chefs do a fantastic job of catering and overall it caters very well to all different tastes even two in our group who usually are very picky had no problem finding things to eat every time. The restaurant had a great atmosphere and again all the staff were amazing Mounad the Manager made sure everything was ok whilst Hassan Yanssef and Houda provided great service with many smiles and always keen to help if they could. The lobby bar staff were also amazing with special shout out for Azdeen as he really did well remembering our orders and being very attentive.  We were there as a group of seven for seven nights and we all had the most amazing experience thanks to all the amazing staff but we must admit the animation team especially Samy and Emma really went the extra mile to make the activities extra fun and we‚Äôre always so happy.  I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a great break a nice chilled hotel that can offer activities to suit your mood and the food and drink are excellent. This was such a great first experience of Morocco & Marrakesh even though souks were a bit hectic shuttle bus was great from hotel and the tours arranged from hotel were all great value.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S6657IVmollym
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Jenny K wrote a review Mar 14,50,Amazing hotel,This was our second holiday of this year and we booked 5 nignts here via an easyJet package deal for ¬£1300 all inclusive. The hotel itself is about 15 minutes drive outside of the city centre and runs daily shuttle busses into the city.    Firstly the rooms are massive. We booked a suite and it was actually bigger than our apartment ha! The suite came with a lovely balcony for sunbathing a bath & separate shower 2 bathrooms living room and 2 televisions which were large.    All inclusive includes 4 bars (including a sports bar!) a pool bar a snack bar which has pizzas sandwiches & salads made to order & a lounge bar which has acoustic music on evening. The lounge bar also does olives & peanuts.    Pool always has music playing which was great! And there‚Äôs a quiet pool too.    Restaurant food was great buffet seemed to always have 2 types of vegetarian tagine made to order pasta as well as usual salads ect as well as many options for meat eaters. The al a carte restaurant also was very nice- the soup was delicious!    We‚Äôd come here again! Staff were friendly and very welcoming and enjoyed entire visit,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Edenbridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennykQ3408OI
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Richie M wrote a review Mar 14,50,Great hotel but first impressions not so..................,"The hotel was lovely and the first few days were very quiet as most guests appear to be golfers and were out for most of the day leaving the pool virtually to ourselves. We would swim in the morning and then in the afternoon move to the swim up pool where it was quieter - although not as warm as the large pool - or to our room which was a swim up room - and the water even colder!!!!!  Our first impressions however were not so good. On arrival at the hotel we were asked to pay approximately ¬£47. When asking what it was for we were told ""tax"". This was not stipulated in any of our paperwork so came as a shock.  Then we were shown to our room and were disappointed that the ""busboy"" or whatever they are called stood in the room I presume waiting for a tip. We had no local currency so I put a pound coin in the palm of his hand. He stood looking at it and I wished I'd taken it back from him! The hotel should inform their staff that this is neither polite nor to be expected from visitors - it was quite uncomfortable having him stand there waiting.  All other staff we encountered are just lovely and you want to tip them as they really do give good service and are very friendly and a credit to the running of the hotel.",Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"St Peter Port, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichieM156

However everything else was absolutely fantastic and I can't thank the staff enough so a wonderful week.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShirlDuff18

The evening singers & dancers were really good and aimed at an adult audience. We went as a group of 8 girls we had an amazing time and will definitely return one day.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Molly M wrote a review Mar 14,50,Fantastic Hotel - We Will Return,I can quite honestly say this is one of the best resorts I‚Äôve stayed at with the nicest atmosphere. The hotel is constantly being cleaned smelling amazing and all the cleaning/housekeeping staff were so happy and friendly. The staff in the pool bar were always very friendly and kept our drinks refilled frequently as well as providing some great food including late breakfasts. Tariq especially was very hard working and friendly. The restaurant buffet was possibly the best I‚Äôve experienced and yes whilst any buffet gets a bit same over seven days the chefs do a fantastic job of catering and overall it caters very well to all different tastes even two in our group who usually are very picky had no problem finding things to eat every time. The restaurant had a great atmosphere and again all the staff were amazing Mounad the Manager made sure everything was ok whilst Hassan Yanssef and Houda provided great service with many smiles and always keen to help if they could. The lobby bar staff were also amazing with special shout out for Azdeen as he really did well remembering our orders and being very attentive.  We were there as a group of seven for seven nights and we all had the most amazing experience thanks to all the amazing staff but we must admit the animation team especially Samy and Emma really went the extra mile to make the activities extra fun and we‚Äôre always so happy.  I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a great break a nice chilled hotel that can offer activities to suit your mood and the food and drink are excellent. This was such a great first experience of Morocco & Marrakesh even though souks were a bit hectic shuttle bus was great from hotel and the tours arranged from hotel were all great value.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S6657IVmollym
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Jenny K wrote a review Mar 14,50,Amazing hotel,This was our second holiday of this year and we booked 5 nignts here via an easyJet package deal for ¬£1300 all inclusive. The hotel itself is about 15 minutes drive outside of the city centre and runs daily shuttle busses into the city.    Firstly the rooms are massive. We booked a suite and it was actually bigger than our apartment ha! The suite came with a lovely balcony for sunbathing a bath & separate shower 2 bathrooms living room and 2 televisions which were large.    All inclusive includes 4 bars (including a sports bar!) a pool bar a snack bar which has pizzas sandwiches & salads made to order & a lounge bar which has acoustic music on evening. The lounge bar also does olives & peanuts.    Pool always has music playing which was great! And there‚Äôs a quiet pool too.    Restaurant food was great buffet seemed to always have 2 types of vegetarian tagine made to order pasta as well as usual salads ect as well as many options for meat eaters. The al a carte restaurant also was very nice- the soup was delicious!    We‚Äôd come here again! Staff were friendly and very welcoming and enjoyed entire visit,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Edenbridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennykQ3408OI
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Richie M wrote a review Mar 14,50,Great hotel but first impressions not so..................,"The hotel was lovely and the first few days were very quiet as most guests appear to be golfers and were out for most of the day leaving the pool virtually to ourselves. We would swim in the morning and then in the afternoon move to the swim up pool where it was quieter - although not as warm as the large pool - or to our room which was a swim up room - and the water even colder!!!!!  Our first impressions however were not so good. On arrival at the hotel we were asked to pay approximately ¬£47. When asking what it was for we were told ""tax"". This was not stipulated in any of our paperwork so came as a shock.  Then we were shown to our room and were disappointed that the ""busboy"" or whatever they are called stood in the room I presume waiting for a tip. We had no local currency so I put a pound coin in the palm of his hand. He stood looking at it and I wished I'd taken it back from him! The hotel should inform their staff that this is neither polite nor to be expected from visitors - it was quite uncomfortable having him stand there waiting.

The hotel was lovely and very clean. The restaurant food was amazing. Had a very large choice but some of it was cold. Breakfast time was very busy as a lot of golfers go there so those to take all the rolls and the bread with Chuck don‚Äôt understand why the hotel as it‚Äôs all-inclusive should provide a packed lunch for them. Also they should have a couple of coffee and tea stations which would take a bit of pressure off of the staff even though they were all fantastic. Keep having to go back and forward. Get in the teas and coffee is in the cups Would make life a bit easier and also I found some evenings they would let people still in their swimwear which is clearly states you cannot go in there in shorts and bikinis. Obviously lunchtime it‚Äôs a bit different but obviously you put a T-shirt or no shorts. We used to sit round the large games pool every day which there was plenty of activities. All the staff there were amazing Emma Sami Titif Oussami who was especially brilliant got a sunbeds every day brought round water to us all when it was really hot which was every day. I will definitely be returning to this hotel next year.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lesleymB9565OV
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Sue M wrote a review Mar 18,50,Amazing hotel with brilliant staff,Just returned after a fantastic 10 nights at this lovely hotel. We had a large room overlooking the pool on the ground floor which was lovely and cleaned every day with fresh towels and the beds were so comfortable.  The restaurant and food were good with a great choice to suit everyone but could do with being hotter we ended up going to the fresh pasta station at the evening to make sure we had hit food. The desserts are delicious and the best I‚Äôve eaten in an all inclusive hotel. Breakfast is frustrating and chaotic as the hotel is a base for the golfers who take over the restaurant first thing and take all the rolls and bread to make sandwiches to take with them the staff are run off their feet and you have to wait for the table to be cleaned then they bring the coffee tea but run out of cups so you have to wait again for them to fetch these. A suggestion would be to take the pressure of the staff to install a couple of self service tea and coffee machines.    What makes this hotel one of the best holidays I‚Äôve had is the staff around the pool Titus Emma Sami and especially Oussami who went out of his way every day to get fresh towels for us and put umbrellas by our sun beds even bringing us bottles of water in the 32 degrees heat. All the team were great fun to be around and we had a great time doing all the activities and met some lovely people.    I would definitely recommend this hotel and hope to return next year.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Crawley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suemF6375WC
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Rachel C wrote a review Mar 17,40,Good for price but not a 5*,I always try to start these reviews with some info about me as a traveller to help others decide if my preferences and tastes align with theirs to enable easier decision making. I am in my late 30‚Äôs and holiday a minimum of twice a year. I am fortunate that I can splash out and stay in some beautiful places in exotic parts of the world but am equally happy to seek out a bargain if it means I can see different parts of the world.    This holiday was a girls week away with the intention of catching some winter sun food and cocktails. We paid under ¬£500 a person for all inclusive inc flights    THE HOTEL    The hotel itself is kept very clean you are welcomed with beautiful incense smells as you arrive. The layout is easy to navigate and small. There are two pools one with a swim up bar and one which is ‚Äòheated‚Äô and where the animation team are based during the day. There are a few sunloungers that need to be replaced as they bow in the middle but on a whole all furnishings and fittings are clean and tidy. The gardens are well kept and aesthetically pleasing.    Plenty of Sun loungers hotel quiet and I was often the only person by the pool until 10-10.30 am.    Location is around 20 minutes away from Marrakesh and there is a free shuttle provided.    THE ROOM    We paid for a basic room with two beds. Room again was clean and pleasant enough beds were very comfortable but pillows not. Mini fridge contained only of water and was not cold. There was a kettle and 2 coffee capsules.  Plenty of hanging space and hangers.    Very strange window from bathroom into the bedroom we found this funny and you could draw a blind for privacy. Bath could not be used as no plug. Shower weak needed a descale but cubicle big and clean. Shower did drip all the time. Two sinks and some tolietries provided which we didn‚Äôt use. Only provided with one big towel and a hand towel which was not great for long thick hair. Hair dryer was not great for a supposed 5* but normal standard for price paid    We were on ground floor and there was a small area to sit outside. It overlooked a wall and little bit of garden.    The room was cleaned every day to a good standard. The cleaners are an asset to this hotel as are the other housekeeping team such as maintenance and gardeners. Clean towels provided each day.    FOOD    The hotel is greatly let down by its food. I am a real foodie and love spending money on food and drink. I am reviewing this based on the price we paid but I was very disappointed.    Food is served in a buffet style. It is very small and the layout is not easy to navigate. I could always find something to eat but noticed the food was very bland with lots of salt used if it was left over from lunch.    There were items of food that were not warm when they should have been and this made them inedible. I normally do not have a sweet tooth however the pastry chef was very talented here and deserts were fantastic.    Once a week you could book to eat in the other sit down restaurant. You have to be spending 4 nights plus to access this. The food was much better but very small menu. I wished there had been an option to pay to eat in this restaurant as I would have used it over the restaurant.    For lunch you could order food at the pool bar which was hot as it was cooked to order.    Waiting staff were ok some friendly others not so.    DRINKS    My friend said she liked the beer as she thought it tasted like corona. The cocktails were very poor as made with cordials and not juices very sweet and syrupy. I can be a lightweight in the heat and feel tipsy quickly if I am not careful‚Ä¶.I did not experience this at all as alcohol very watered down. Again for the price paid this was ok but not 5* standard. There is no option to buy better wines unless you were in the sit down restaurant and these did not look great for the price.    The bar staff in the lobby bar were fab very efficient kind and good service provided bring drinks to you.    Pool bar we only used once so can not comment we did not use the sports bar but the snack bar had poorer quality of staff service. Very rare to get a smile.    ENTERTAINMENT    Evening entertainment was ok for price paid. Some singers a disco dancers etc. they had karaoke which is not my personal favourite but was very popular.    The animation team by the ‚Äòheated‚Äô pool were an asset to the hotel. Emma and Sami spent the most time with us but all the team provided 10/10 service.    SUSTAINABILITY    Whilst I am not an eco warrior I have started to consider the environmental sustainability of hotels I stay in. This was not great for sustainable models. Very small plastic cups bottles straws used. Plastic cutlery at snack bar.    SPA    The spa was ok pleasing on the eye and clean. Treatments were mediocre but only cost 700 mad for a full massage and additional head massage so reasonably priced    OVERALL    We paid for what we got. I would rate this as a high end 3* to low end 4*. I was surprised we had wrist bands had towel cards had to pay room and towel deposits of 1000 mad as this is not expected in a five star hotel. The food and drinks are what would move this down to a 3* I‚Äôm my opinion.    The ages of guests ranged but there was a high percentage of young influencers around the hotel which may be why some of the reviews lean towards a false impression of five star standards.    Would I come back? Unlikely. Would I have been happy if I had paid a five star price for this holiday ‚Ä¶.NO. If you are paying over 500 GBP at this hotel at this time of year for a week then you are paying way too much in my opinion.    The staff (most) are what makes this hotel    My expectations of 5* differ greatly from the hotel and this would make me cautious booking an expensive holiday with this hotel chain worldwide.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L1291HJrachelc

I believe we were due to have a clay massage but never had it because we were just pointed to the end of the corridor.

The hotel is constantly being cleaned smelling amazing and all the cleaning/housekeeping staff were so happy and friendly. The staff in the pool bar were always very friendly and kept our drinks refilled frequently as well as providing some great food including late breakfasts. Tariq especially was very hard working and friendly. The restaurant buffet was possibly the best I‚Äôve experienced and yes whilst any buffet gets a bit same over seven days the chefs do a fantastic job of catering and overall it caters very well to all different tastes even two in our group who usually are very picky had no problem finding things to eat every time. The restaurant had a great atmosphere and again all the staff were amazing Mounad the Manager made sure everything was ok whilst Hassan Yanssef and Houda provided great service with many smiles and always keen to help if they could. The lobby bar staff were also amazing with special shout out for Azdeen as he really did well remembering our orders and being very attentive.  We were there as a group of seven for seven nights and we all had the most amazing experience thanks to all the amazing staff but we must admit the animation team especially Samy and Emma really went the extra mile to make the activities extra fun and we‚Äôre always so happy.  I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a great break a nice chilled hotel that can offer activities to suit your mood and the food and drink are excellent.

The hotel itself is about 15 minutes drive outside of the city centre and runs daily shuttle busses into the city.    Firstly the rooms are massive. We booked a suite and it was actually bigger than our apartment ha! The suite came with a lovely balcony for sunbathing a bath & separate shower 2 bathrooms living room and 2 televisions which were large.

The lounge bar also does olives & peanuts.    Pool always has music playing which was great! And there‚Äôs a quiet pool too.    Restaurant food was great buffet seemed to always have 2 types of vegetarian tagine made to order pasta as well as usual salads ect as well as many options for meat eaters.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Richie M wrote a review Mar 14,50,Great hotel but first impressions not so..................,"The hotel was lovely and the first few days were very quiet as most guests appear to be golfers and were out for most of the day leaving the pool virtually to ourselves. We would swim in the morning and then in the afternoon move to the swim up pool where it was quieter - although not as warm as the large pool - or to our room which was a swim up room - and the water even colder!!!!!  Our first impressions however were not so good. On arrival at the hotel we were asked to pay approximately ¬£47. When asking what it was for we were told ""tax"". This was not stipulated in any of our paperwork so came as a shock.  Then we were shown to our room and were disappointed that the ""busboy"" or whatever they are called stood in the room I presume waiting for a tip. We had no local currency so I put a pound coin in the palm of his hand. He stood looking at it and I wished I'd taken it back from him! The hotel should inform their staff that this is neither polite nor to be expected from visitors - it was quite uncomfortable having him stand there waiting.  All other staff we encountered are just lovely and you want to tip them as they really do give good service and are very friendly and a credit to the running of the hotel.",Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"St Peter Port, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichieM156

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Lesley M wrote a review Mar 18,40,Amazing,I have just returned from this hotel. Having spent 10 nights there. The room was fantastic very clean. The hotel was lovely and very clean. The restaurant food was amazing. Had a very large choice but some of it was cold. Breakfast time was very busy as a lot of golfers go there so those to take all the rolls and the bread with Chuck don‚Äôt understand why the hotel as it‚Äôs all-inclusive should provide a packed lunch for them. Also they should have a couple of coffee and tea stations which would take a bit of pressure off of the staff even though they were all fantastic. Keep having to go back and forward. Get in the teas and coffee is in the cups Would make life a bit easier and also I found some evenings they would let people still in their swimwear which is clearly states you cannot go in there in shorts and bikinis. Obviously lunchtime it‚Äôs a bit different but obviously you put a T-shirt or no shorts. We used to sit round the large games pool every day which there was plenty of activities. All the staff there were amazing Emma Sami Titif Oussami who was especially brilliant got a sunbeds every day brought round water to us all when it was really hot which was every day. I will definitely be returning to this hotel next year.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lesleymB9565OV
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Sue M wrote a review Mar 18,50,Amazing hotel with brilliant staff,Just returned after a fantastic 10 nights at this lovely hotel. We had a large room overlooking the pool on the ground floor which was lovely and cleaned every day with fresh towels and the beds were so comfortable.  The restaurant and food were good with a great choice to suit everyone but could do with being hotter we ended up going to the fresh pasta station at the evening to make sure we had hit food. The desserts are delicious and the best I‚Äôve eaten in an all inclusive hotel. Breakfast is frustrating and chaotic as the hotel is a base for the golfers who take over the restaurant first thing and take all the rolls and bread to make sandwiches to take with them the staff are run off their feet and you have to wait for the table to be cleaned then they bring the coffee tea but run out of cups so you have to wait again for them to fetch these. A suggestion would be to take the pressure of the staff to install a couple of self service tea and coffee machines.    What makes this hotel one of the best holidays I‚Äôve had is the staff around the pool Titus Emma Sami and especially Oussami who went out of his way every day to get fresh towels for us and put umbrellas by our sun beds even bringing us bottles of water in the 32 degrees heat. All the team were great fun to be around and we had a great time doing all the activities and met some lovely people.    I would definitely recommend this hotel and hope to return next year.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Crawley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suemF6375WC
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Rachel C wrote a review Mar 17,40,Good for price but not a 5*,I always try to start these reviews with some info about me as a traveller to help others decide if my preferences and tastes align with theirs to enable easier decision making. I am in my late 30‚Äôs and holiday a minimum of twice a year. I am fortunate that I can splash out and stay in some beautiful places in exotic parts of the world but am equally happy to seek out a bargain if it means I can see different parts of the world.    This holiday was a girls week away with the intention of catching some winter sun food and cocktails. We paid under ¬£500 a person for all inclusive inc flights    THE HOTEL    The hotel itself is kept very clean you are welcomed with beautiful incense smells as you arrive. The layout is easy to navigate and small. There are two pools one with a swim up bar and one which is ‚Äòheated‚Äô and where the animation team are based during the day. There are a few sunloungers that need to be replaced as they bow in the middle but on a whole all furnishings and fittings are clean and tidy. The gardens are well kept and aesthetically pleasing.    Plenty of Sun loungers hotel quiet and I was often the only person by the pool until 10-10.30 am.    Location is around 20 minutes away from Marrakesh and there is a free shuttle provided.    THE ROOM    We paid for a basic room with two beds. Room again was clean and pleasant enough beds were very comfortable but pillows not. Mini fridge contained only of water and was not cold. There was a kettle and 2 coffee capsules.  Plenty of hanging space and hangers.    Very strange window from bathroom into the bedroom we found this funny and you could draw a blind for privacy. Bath could not be used as no plug. Shower weak needed a descale but cubicle big and clean. Shower did drip all the time. Two sinks and some tolietries provided which we didn‚Äôt use. Only provided with one big towel and a hand towel which was not great for long thick hair. Hair dryer was not great for a supposed 5* but normal standard for price paid    We were on ground floor and there was a small area to sit outside. It overlooked a wall and little bit of garden.    The room was cleaned every day to a good standard. The cleaners are an asset to this hotel as are the other housekeeping team such as maintenance and gardeners. Clean towels provided each day.    FOOD    The hotel is greatly let down by its food. I am a real foodie and love spending money on food and drink. I am reviewing this based on the price we paid but I was very disappointed.    Food is served in a buffet style. It is very small and the layout is not easy to navigate. I could always find something to eat but noticed the food was very bland with lots of salt used if it was left over from lunch.    There were items of food that were not warm when they should have been and this made them inedible. I normally do not have a sweet tooth however the pastry chef was very talented here and deserts were fantastic.    Once a week you could book to eat in the other sit down restaurant. You have to be spending 4 nights plus to access this. The food was much better but very small menu. I wished there had been an option to pay to eat in this restaurant as I would have used it over the restaurant.    For lunch you could order food at the pool bar which was hot as it was cooked to order.    Waiting staff were ok some friendly others not so.    DRINKS    My friend said she liked the beer as she thought it tasted like corona. The cocktails were very poor as made with cordials and not juices very sweet and syrupy. I can be a lightweight in the heat and feel tipsy quickly if I am not careful‚Ä¶.I did not experience this at all as alcohol very watered down. Again for the price paid this was ok but not 5* standard. There is no option to buy better wines unless you were in the sit down restaurant and these did not look great for the price.    The bar staff in the lobby bar were fab very efficient kind and good service provided bring drinks to you.    Pool bar we only used once so can not comment we did not use the sports bar but the snack bar had poorer quality of staff service. Very rare to get a smile.    ENTERTAINMENT    Evening entertainment was ok for price paid. Some singers a disco dancers etc. they had karaoke which is not my personal favourite but was very popular.    The animation team by the ‚Äòheated‚Äô pool were an asset to the hotel. Emma and Sami spent the most time with us but all the team provided 10/10 service.    SUSTAINABILITY    Whilst I am not an eco warrior I have started to consider the environmental sustainability of hotels I stay in. This was not great for sustainable models. Very small plastic cups bottles straws used. Plastic cutlery at snack bar.    SPA    The spa was ok pleasing on the eye and clean. Treatments were mediocre but only cost 700 mad for a full massage and additional head massage so reasonably priced    OVERALL    We paid for what we got. I would rate this as a high end 3* to low end 4*. I was surprised we had wrist bands had towel cards had to pay room and towel deposits of 1000 mad as this is not expected in a five star hotel. The food and drinks are what would move this down to a 3* I‚Äôm my opinion.    The ages of guests ranged but there was a high percentage of young influencers around the hotel which may be why some of the reviews lean towards a false impression of five star standards.    Would I come back? Unlikely. Would I have been happy if I had paid a five star price for this holiday ‚Ä¶.NO. If you are paying over 500 GBP at this hotel at this time of year for a week then you are paying way too much in my opinion.    The staff (most) are what makes this hotel    My expectations of 5* differ greatly from the hotel and this would make me cautious booking an expensive holiday with this hotel chain worldwide.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L1291HJrachelc

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,t e wrote a review Feb 2023,10,absolutely terrible holiday - poor hygiene,We were booked to stay from 7th to 17th February but stayed one extra night due to illness (more later).  I want to be balanced in this review and give the positive and the negative:    The positive:  1. the pool areas and gardens are beautiful and well looked after.  2. The bedrooms are a good size with comfortable beds  3. The bathroom is a good size with good shower and bath  4. The waiting and room cleaning staff are really helpful and friendly  5. The a la carte restaurant is ok but nothing special (one visit per week permitted )    The negative:  1. Hygiene in the buffet restaurant and hotel corridors is appallingly bad - it is all self service with all the guests handling the same serving spoons and tongs (some using hands) - it would be much better if you could point to what you want and the hotel staff serve it onto your plate.  2. Most of the food that is supposed to be hot in the buffet restaurant is just warm at best  3. after a couple of days the food seemed rather bland and tasteless  4. It seems that food left from yesterday is reprocessed and represented the next day  5. the free alcohol is poor quality and feels very weak  6. the tiled corridor from our room to reception was nearly always dirty with drink and food stains on the floor - I only ever saw it cleaned once per day  7. My wife contracted food poisoning on day 4 and suffered sickness and diarreah (see note below)  8. The cleaning maid told us not to worry about the mess as 2 rooms near us also had sickness and diarrhea  9. 2 nights later we heard 2 people above us throwing up all night  10. The hotel had a serious outbreak of sickness and diarrhea  11. The attitude of the senior management of the hotel is disgusting and we were very badly treated - the Public relations manager seated at a desk in reception area denied there was ever a problem (privately the food and beverage manager admitted to us and to another couple separately that there was a problem) - mysteriously we never saw him again.    Why do I feel the hotel has a problem with food hygiene and preparation? Please read the following and be very careful if you go to this hotel....    On day 4 of our 10 day holiday my wife had sickness and diarreah after 2 days of continuation the TUI rep called a doctor to our room - he diagnosed gastroenteritis and gave injections and tablets to follow. He said it would be fine in 24 hours. After 36 hours my wife was more poorly than ever. My travel insurance insisted I take my wife to hospital. the ambulance arrived in 30 minutes (the hotel nurse was very helpful at this stage). In hospital my wife was diagnosed with a rare form of gastroenteritis and dysentery caused by an amoeba (small larvae). This type of amoeba is tropical and caused by passing the infection on through contaminated water and food. My wife never left the hotel other than in an ambulance to go to hospital. There is no doubt this infection was caught at the hotel - but the public relations manager denied there was a problem and stated it was not their responsibility. She then quizzed me why I had not reported this to the hotel - I did after 24 hours. She then asked my why I did not call the hotel nurse - because I didn't know there was a hotel nurse. To cut a long story short my wife spent 3 days in hospital very ill indeed and could have died. She is now in a UK hospital still very unwell. On 3 occasions I asked to meet with the general manager - once to the front of house public relations manager once to reception and once (via the TUI rep) to the Head of public relations who sat in an office near the reception. On all 3 occasions I was refused access to the general manager    Conclusion  Without the problems we have experienced I would say the hotel is probably an average 3 stars. The hygiene situation particularly in the buffet restaurant is dire and needs addressing urgently by the hotel. The attitude of senior management is disgusting.  I cannot recommend this hotel on any level. if you do use it my advice is be very careful in the buffet restaurant.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Devon, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TE600053AJE

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Ellie-Jayne Ryder wrote a review Feb 2023,30,Lovely stay - but not 5*,Have just returned from a weeks stay at Be Live Collection.    Pro‚Äôs  - The hotel grounds are lovely and well looked after the lobby area is lovely and always spotless.  - We just had a standard room which was plenty big enough pleasant and had a good standard of house keeping everyday.  - The staff are really friendly & attentive. Mustapha in the Sports Bar takes extra care with his cocktails & they are definitely the best! Adezine in the Lobby Bar also makes sure you never have an empty glass. The Entertainment team around the pool are also very friendly & chatty.  - The shuttle bus into town (although the times could be slightly more accommodating ie there‚Äôs a massive gap in the afternoon) is free and pick up and drop off in the centre of town is easy.    Con‚Äôs  - There is really only one option for dinner daily which is the buffet restaurant. For us the food really could be improved. The buffet was very same same. Felt it was lacking options could have done with utilising the live cooking stations better or having a different themes for part of the buffet each night ie Asian Indian etc in order to break it up slightly. The food on the whole just tasted a bit bland (except the puddings - these were really nice).  - Breakfast wise queues by the toaster and the egg station made it feel a bit canteen-y as people often ended up queuing for food.  - The Ksar restaurant was nice however please be aware you can only use this ONCE per week so we could only visit this once. When told this on arrival we were quite disappointed.  - Drinks were not premium alcohol you had to pay extra if you wanted branded ie Gordon‚Äôs gin. The cocktails on the whole were not the best as they were weak and often made with mixers from concentrate. They were also inconsistent and no 2 seemed to taste the same.  - Obviously the hotel cannot control the weather however we felt more could have been done by way of entertainment on days when it wasn‚Äôt sunny in order to keep people‚Äôs morale.    Haven‚Äôt visited a 5* in Morocco previously so may be that we are being harsh in our expectation however this hotel didn‚Äôt compare to 5* hotels of Europe & the Caribbean but nonetheless we had a pleasant stay.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elliejayneryder

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Kay4s wrote a review Feb 2023,10,Dreadful experience,This hotel is Not 5 star 3.5/4 star at best.Rooms tired already towels grey and frayed. Azdine in lobby bar was exceptional resulting in hotel being more of a party hotel not 5 star luxury. Food on first impressions looks good.nicely presented with a talented pastry chef. Food and hygiene protocols Not in place not all serving chefs wear gloves prep counters chicken and fish alongside. No consideration people suffering from nut allergies nuts permanently displayed. Early breakfast service atrocious staff along with duty manager more interested in chatting than setting tables providing tea and coffee. Omelette station extremely slow. Lunch and dinner food is tasteless served cold buffet style which is a breeding ground for bacteria food is recycled. Heat lamps are not hot plates are cold. Numerous guests suffered gastric complaints with one guest being hospitalised for days. Management admitted there was a problem but were not interested.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Croakie wrote a review Feb 2023,10,"Fake, mediocre and rude!",Nothing 5-star there!    You have to leave a deposit (very 5-star!) for a room (and pool towel) in which the hand shower heads are either not working (shower) or leaking half the pressure (tub).    You get a very early idea of what 'all inclusive' means there when you discover you only have 2 Nespresso capsules for the whole stay and that additional capsules must be bought (cash of course) at reception at 15 dirhams (150 euros) a piece. Also the mini-bar only contains water and not only do you need to pay for anything else but it's not even in the mini-bar!    The food is just above average and everything is cold (those lamps are either off or not strong enough) The wine is terrible!  The waiters can easily reallocate your table to someone else if you're too long getting more food at the buffet.  Oh and if you came to Morocco to enjoy fresh and ripe vegetables and fruits you're in for a disappointment: tomatoes bananas and avocados are as unripe and hard as in Paris. With the exception of orange all juices are factory-made as is very likely most of what's presented on the buffet.    The bars offer a nice variety of beverages and cocktails which all share the same characteristics: cheap alcohol and too much sugar. I've heard someone say that they overdose the alcohol because they want you to get drunk faster so they don't have to serve you again. Don't know if it's true.....    Nobody gets the same price at the Spa where you are encouraged to pash cash again and once the money pocketed (litterally as far as I could tell) you get treatments that are too soft and ineffective anyway.  I don't know where those masseuses got their training (probably a crash online course) but their gestures are mechanical and uncaring.  Like most of the hotel staff they don't want to be there and they don't care.  A special mention for the music at the spa which must be managed by a child because tracks keep skipping at random (next previous same sometimes 4 times in a row sometimes the volume doubles....) making it impossible to fully relax in the booth.    What affected me the most was the lack of care and professionalism. If you are a little observant you see very quickly that the smiles are as fake as the goods they sell in town that they don't care about quality or customer satisfaction or anything else that makes up good service.    So really nothing 5- star there!,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled solo,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Croakie77

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Jacqueline H wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Be Live Hotel Hospitality,From the moment your taxi glides through the security gates you experience quality service. Every staff member has your interest at heart. Mustapha and Ayoub at the reception desk made check in pleasurable and were attentive and as helpful as possible throughout my 8 day stay. Bedrooms were impeccably styled and always clean the buffet was an Aladdin's cave of delicious fare and drinks were varied and plentiful. Ayoub in the restaurant kept a keen eye on operations and service. Facilities were created and suit the adult market. Just disappointed with the onslaught of guests at the weekend when the restaurant was like a cattle market with younger guests on a conference pushing shoving and the loud disrespect for other people. The Moroccan restaurant was disappointing.  Yusin at the Tour Guide desk was marvellous helpful honest but always courteous and professional - he was the Man in the know to go to as well as the Public Relations rep. A big thank you to all the employees for a MOST MEMORABLRE AND WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Rae A wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Best trip for the start of the year,My partner and I really enjoyed our time at the hotel. We just wished we had more time. Everything was perfect. From the food the drinks and the event planners that helped with the activities and selection of music by the pool not to mention the night life. Also if you're in need of some great holiday pics in the hotel ask for a guy called Halim. He's really good with the camera. We got around 200+ photos for a good deal. Getting around is fairly easy as there is a free shuttle that has its own timetable that takes you into town (the Medina) from the hotel and back. You must book in adv like a day before at reception and a ticket will be handed to you. If you miss the shuttle coming back you have to make your own way back I assume. Reception were helpful from the day we arrived till the last day we left. I hope to see everyone again when we come back. It was great to be around many people and the beautiful faces of Morocco. It was an amazing experience we would love the re-live again.    Souifian Abdulatif Emaal Ennel Halim so many names to add a big thankyou to you all!!

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Lee P wrote a review Feb 2023,50,"Thanks Azdine in the main bar, Nour El Houda <3 in the conservatory",We spent Christmas as the Be Live Adults' Only hotel and was there for 13 nights. We cut our trip short by 3 days (still haven't had a refund) as 16 nights would have been far too long to stay in the same routine every day. We really loved the staff at the hotel particularly Azdine in the main bar Nour El Houda <3 in the conservatory part of the main restaurant Tarek and Aaron in the snack bar they were all absolutely amazing. They really know how to look after you we tend to like a bottle of wine and they were all so kind with the service. (Thank you guys you all deserve pay rises) Now the place was faultless it's very clean and spotless service impeccable apart from the tour guide desk (will come back to that later) but it is very samey (even the music around the crazy - warm pool is the same tape playing every day) so you do start to feel a bit Groundhog. which is the only reason we left early. So my only advice would be perhaps to do a twin center holiday perhaps 5 nights here and 5 at an alternative place but in all the managers really know what they are doing as everything else is impeccable. including the lovely chamber/cleaning staff. Just don't go Groundhog like we did :) We met some lovely people and made some solid friendships. It's a very social and friendly environment and easy to chill and relax on comfy sunbeds around the cold pool. Perfect for that The rooms are sparse but big and very clean. If you book a tour with the tour guide and want to have a guide around the Souks make sure you tell the guy at the hotel you don't want to be taken to all the tourist traps where they do the hard sell and are mates and give the guide commission we ended up leaving after 30 minutes So be warned. But overall we would go back for the staff the location the sunshine and the nice people that we met there. So don't let the bad reviews put you off the swim up rooms are probably nice when it's 40 degrees but no way in winter. Thanks Adzine and Nour for making our holiday!!! Ps.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,T. M. Smith wrote a review Jan 2023,40,Solid 4 stars. Could use a little Lagniappe but otherwise perfect.,This is a late review but my girlfriend and I are planning another trip to Marrakech and I remembered this hotel. Honestly we booked a day long excursion for each of our three days there so we did not get to teally use the amenities or need anything from the staff. But I will review the good and bad that I do remember. With the nuamce that this review is based on the price we paid. The resort itself is a solid 4 stars. The furniture is not the best quality but the decor was nice. The grounds are lush and really beautiful at night. The grounds were safe as the security was very attentive. We rented the bikes the resort had and did a self tour of the area and while it seems like the property is far from everything we still found a lot of picturesque scenery and had fun. The food selection was decent again for the price and the fact that it was an all-inclusive. The beer wine and mixed drink selection was limited but strong. The staff was attentive and efficient as I do not remember check in taking a long time and after requesting additional towels the first day housekeeping supplied extra towels every day of our stay. For a first timer visiting this city this resort is perfect. But something about it was missing. It was a solid 4 star resort.,Date of stay: April 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Houston, Texas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noeplaya1

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Tee wrote a review Jan 2023,30,Overall good,Overall the stay was pleasant and we would return again in warmer months.  Myself and my friend (2 girls early twenties) stayed here for 2 nights which we got through a wowcher deal.  The hotel is very modern clean and aesthetic.  Staff were polite and helpful.  I liked that room came with 2 double beds 2 sinks and both a bath and shower. Plenty of space to store luggage & clothes. The bed provided was probably one of the comfiest I have ever experienced at hotel! The only thing I felt the room lacked was having an iron and iron board for convenience.  In terms of food the buffet had an adequate selection but as a vegetarian I felt there could‚Äôve been more options though all I did eat was very tasty. The way service ran seemed a bit odd though upon entering you would seat yourself which was fine but could sometimes be awkward as you wouldn‚Äôt know which tables were already taken and which weren‚Äôt if belongings hadn‚Äôt been left. It also meant you had to flag down a waiter to request drinks. I don‚Äôt know if it was more to do with the fact we were 2 young girls on our own but we were never first asked what we wanted to drink first at breakfast or dinner though we would see other couples/groups being brought over cups and saucers without request in the morning. The on-site Moroccan restaurant was 5/5.  The facilities of this hotel are good 2 lovely outside pools however too cold to use at this time of year so we just sunbathed in the afternoon. We did buy a spa package which allowed us to use the indoor heated pool - although this still wasn‚Äôt very warm! The packaged we bought cost about ¬£90 for use of the pool all day hammam treatment and 1 hour massage which we felt very good value for money - greatly enjoyed! Nice gym and small shop onsite for toiletries and snacks.  What felt was lacking a bit was entertainment day entertainment we guessed was due to the colder weather and the hotel not being full. However rather than trying to engage guests with some sort of activity it seemed like the entertainment guys just stood around chatting instead. We visited the sports bar on the first night which was pleasant with a foosball and snooker table but it was rather small. On the second night we joined the karaoke in the lobby bar which was fun though it shut down at midnight and general drinks/alcohol also purchase stopped then. Good selection of cocktails on offer.  We were one of a few younger groups but most of the clientele seemed to be middle aged couples/groups.  We quad biked in the desert which we‚Äôd definitely recommend! Be sure to do research on tour operators we felt ours (Rak adventures) was very good value for money getting 2 hours out in the dessert with snacks morrocan tea and photo opps.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teewells2022
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Heidi S wrote a review Jan 2023,40,Nice but wouldn‚Äôt return,Just got back yesterday from a week here heres my thoughts:    Hotel/reception:  All super clean and tidy the reception staff were okay we booked everything through easyjet and they couldn‚Äôt find our booking which was stressful is a ¬£110 charge on arrival (¬£80 you get back when you check out)    Room:  The room was absolutely beautiful! Huge bathroom with bath and shower there is a window directly into bedroom fyi incase that bothers you (glad we didnt pay for a ‚Äúswim up room‚Äù as they are the rip off!)    Pools:  When we arrived the main pool was out of service.. brilliant.. luckily it opened a few days later this pool is nice (nice music mostly English songs) the other smaller pool is ICE cold but still okay for sunbathing no fighting over sunbeds at all here as theres so many we used the spa pool the most as it was the warmest of the three.    Spa:  The spa is stunning but not included we paid ¬£250 for a package to use the pool ultimates times which also came with treatments which were interesting.. the spa staff were a little pushy to make you buy treatments    Food:  The food was okay not great if you‚Äôre fussy like me my partner enjoyed it more the pancakes and puddings were great. Once we used the snack bar we went there every day for lunch as it was much better (burgers sandwiches chips pizzas paninis etc) the cocktails were really nice too    Entertainment/Drinks:  The lobby bar where the evening entertainment is is very small you have to get there early if you want a seat the staff in the main restaurant were great my wine was topped up before id even finished my glass.    Overall it was nice however I wouldn‚Äôt return or recommend it to a friend/family partly because of journey (not the hotels fault but worth knowing) the airports a nightmare and the private transfers are INSANE?! Both of them using there phone while driving both nearly crashed (multiple times) and even apologised to us the roads are indescribably dangerous here.    Most of the staff were lovely and friendly and the weather was mostly sunny enough to sunbathe and relax which is what we wanted but I wasn‚Äôt blown away the way we normally are with inclusive adult only resorts.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeidiAndRyan143

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Pioneer512219 wrote a review Jan 2023,50,"Excellent staff, excellent hotel",Stayed for 15 nights. Left 19/01/23  The hotel immediately feels very smart/ very swish. This feeling never dipped in over 2 weeks.  The night life is very good with nightly live music 8-10 then a DJ or twice weekly the Sunset üåá band who are awesome. A 5 piece group who could play the O2 arena. Such cool entertainers. 20 or 50 people they would make it a party. Wow!  A once small tip 20Dh ensured nightly table service.    The separate sports bar is a nice touch to watch a live game on Bein sports. Lots of board games f√ºssball table & pool table. Mustafa the barman is nice and will find the football game if you ask him.    Coming from a customer - care background I was very impressed with the Fantastic staff from reception bar staff cafe staff to the cleaners/gardener's .  The 3 diligent managers who are always wandering round should be proud of themselves.    Outstanding staff members of our trip was Sara from the Lobby bar who has a lovely friendly can-do manner.  Also Omar and Esmee from the French style outside cafe who were excellent.  Amy & Abdullah of the animation team we're Great and taught us Arabic. Which proved really helpful in the Medina's.    We found the food superb French Moroccan Italian.  Dining in the conservatory at night is a must do experience.    The Separate Moroccan restaurant was nice with morrocan live music. Though you pay for drinks here bottle of wine around ¬£25    One swimming pool was heated which was fine.  The quiet pool was not heated though the surrounding fauna is beautiful. It's so peaceful with the sound of birds.  The loungers were plentiful & we really liked the free cabanas.    We found the bedrooms super swish beds so big you need a Walkie talkie. Ask for first floor room to avoid noise from upstairs. )    Our only gripe was the deafening music on the bus to and fro the Medina. Sometimes putting my hands over my ears as the driver scrolled blaring radio station after radio station.    All in all a great experience.

Really enjoyed all the activities and considering I was a solo traveler at a resort with lots of couples I didn't get bored and it was just the perfect relaxing getaway.    The staff were also all really friendly. Most remember your name and drink order so they quickly make you feel very comfortable. Amine at the lobby bar was particularly great and always went the extra mile to help me with suggestions about what to do in Marrakech which was super helpful and he really helped me make my trip unforgettable. The guys at the pool bar and at reception were also fantastic - always attentive without being intrusive.    The only suggestion I have is that it would be great if you could pre-book early check in. I had a super early flight so was very tired when I got there but was unable to check in for quite a while.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Chris S wrote a review Jan 2023,50,Some incredible staff,Location - around 25/30 mins from the airport in middle of nowhere which is good if you want to cocoon yourself into your holiday.  Hotel offers a superb free shuttle down to town pick up and drop off easy.    The hotel - the hotel is kept clean and pristine constantly someones always mopping sweeping or buffing something.  Two pools - one heated and one fresh water (fresh water has swim up bar) and they have nice selection of chairs and beds to use around the pool (beds are popular so add in English people and their towels you‚Äôll struggle to get one)    Food - we have all done the AI holiday and feeding time is usually like school dinners.  This place you felt as though you were in a restaurant and the service is attentive and personal.  The food itself was varied and at an incredibly high level probably the best AI food I‚Äôve ever had.    Staff - this is where it matters. Staff are incredible. They are professional but also let their personality show at times they seem to enjoy their work and that makes it easier for the guest (me) to relax.    Overall - I looked at it as a Butlins on cocaine when I arrived. My perception was wrong. The hotel is indeed 5 stars the service is up there with British 5 stars.

Got to give a shout out to Hassan in the buffet restaurant such a hard worker always has a smile on his face and made sure our drinks were topped up without having to ask. The sports bar is fun there's a pool table a football table and lots of little games to play like dominoes checkers scrabble.

Staff our exceptional and rooms cleaned everyday with new bedding and towels etc. Walid and Mustafa at the swim ip pool bar were brilliant and made us feel so welcome.    Food was very good with large selection. You also have the option to have bespoke pasta dishes made to you specification likewise with omelettes in the morning. Every evening there is a bespoke special. .. So keep your eyes peeled for that also.    X2 pool options one is more communal close to the snack bar serving drinks and food. .. Burgers etc... This pool area has contemary music playing all day. With some activities games etc.    The other pool is very quiet and we gravitated to this most days for even more peace and chill time using the swim up pool bar. However this pool is not heated and cold but that's Jan for you. But you can use the poolside to get served by the brilliant Walid and Mustafa. üëç    Sports bar... The local on site for all big sports action playing all Premier league games.    Rooms & Swim up - great spacious rooms cleaned daily we had a massive bath and separate large shower room that we were really happy with. The TV channels were not very good for UK guests but we were not there to watch TV.    The swim up was OK... I would go for this if holidaying in summer but as it was Jan it was really cold so consider this if you are on a budget paying more ¬£ in Jan or Feb as you won't use it. That said the swim up gives you a South facing garden view whereas some other rooms on site don't. So food for though here when booking.    Loby bar- really enjoyed this bar... One of the guys was exceptional but his name alludes me... But all the team were great and entertainment is on every evening. Also if your choice of cocktail is not on the menu just ask... We ordered espresso martinis and they happily made these for us. üëç    This is a gated complex manned 24/7 and we felt extreamly safe.    Top tip... Use Viatour to book trips out with a guide...

On arrival our bags were taken into the hotel for us we were offered a drink and biscuit which were lovely. A little bit of paperwork to fill in and we then got our room key. We were taken to our room which was one of the nicest rooms i have ever stayed in. plenty of room big shower bath option and an enormous bed. Not to mention how immaculately clean it was. Bedding appeared to be changed most days and cleaners were very efficient. Bottle of water refrigerated for our arrival.  In my opinion the food was good plenty to chose from if you take into account the size of the hotel. My partner is a very fussy eater and even he managed to fill and clear his plate!  The evening entertainment was a little hit and miss but that was expected at this time of year.  The pools were very clean plenty of sun-beds and quick service at the pool bar and snack bar. It was also very peaceful.  The staff here were amazing couldn‚Äôt do enough for you! always remembered our drinks keen to refill them too! sometimes i was triple parked!  Free transport into and back from marrakesh which is a brilliant bonus! we didn‚Äôt use this as we had a few other day trips booked through trip advisor - would recommend looking at these especially as they picked us up and dropped off directly at the hotel!    The only negative I have and this is nothing to do with the hotel really is that there were several large groups of extremely rowdy guests (better suited to an 18-30 holiday) shouting across the dining room intimidating other guests and being totally loud and obnoxious. We upped and moved to another table on the other side of the restaurant mid way through our meal on several occasions but this wasn‚Äôt enough to escape the noise. It would have been appreciated if staff had acknowledged this and at least asked them to quieten down.

A big thankyou to our friend Titif who taught us french boulesarchery and darts.  The water aerobics was really fun too.  We had a really good time at karaoke night and the dj party.  Again the animation team really went out of their way and nothing was too much trouble to make sure we had a great timethose guys work really hard and deserve a special mention  Thanks again Titif  We definately intend to returnsee you all next year,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Moonshadow111

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Grant M wrote a review Jan 2023,50,Awesome Mini Break,From the moment we arrived and started to check-in we were greeted warmly and offered traditional mint tea and pastries while filling out our locator forms ( very nice biscuits not so keen on the mint tea personally .    Once checked in we were escorted to our double room with a pool view. Room was excellent. Plenty of storage safe in the wardrobe air con extremely comfortable bed and a small patio leading to a stream like pool with sun beds.    Large shower two sinks bath and obviously a w/c. Rooms cleaned everyday.    The food was excellent. So many choices at breakfast lunch and dinner it would be impossible to type it all. All the waiters and waitresses couldn‚Äôt be more helpful if they tried  constantly topping up your tea and coffee at breakfast then wine/beer at lunch and dinner.    The bar staff in the main bar are amazing with photographic memories. They knew what everyone was drinking and always made sure your glass was topped up or your favourite tipple was bought straight to your table. Plus point of this was no queue at the bar.    There‚Äôs also a sports bar by the top pool which is quieter with a pool table football table board games and live sport. Then there‚Äôs the snack bar by the heated pool and a swim up bar in the other pool which isn‚Äôt heated there‚Äôs also a Moroccan restaurant on site which is included in your stay a must try.    The grounds of the hotel are immaculate and we‚Äôre always being cleaned/tidied up.    The activity crew round the main pool were brilliant always encouraging participation in archery crazy darts mini golf table tennis aqua aerobics football and a few other activities throughout the day.    As evening entertainment goes it was excellent. Most nights you have a band provided and a DJ which created a fantastic atmospherewhich leads to lots of dancing if you like a boogie. We also had Latin dancers one night and they were very good.    The chaps out the front of the hotel would order taxis to wherever you wanted if you didn‚Äôt want to use the free shuttle bus. We only used the free bus twice to the medina market and couldn‚Äôt fault the service. You can book lots of different trips at the hotel as well. We didn‚Äôt do any trips as we only had five days to relax and unwind in the sunshine.    On a final note. Whoever has or is thinking about going to this fabulous hotel have a fantastic time me and my wife did and are seriously thinking about going again this year.,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W4542VAgrantm

Everything was very good but above all was the level of friendliness and helpfulness of all the staff in the reception restaurants bars and around the pool and gardens!  It may be unfair to mention individuals but we found Nour El Houda in the buffet bar gave us the highest service and made each lunchtime a special occasion!  Also Sara in the loby bar told us so much about the history of Morocco and helped us with how to get to the various markets.  We look forward to return soon!

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,SPPH wrote a review Dec 2022,40,Read if you are checking in late! Maybe we just got unlucky!?!,"Overall a pleasant relaxing hotel. Just be mindful - if you are checking in late don't expect a 'normal service' at check-in.    Cons:  1) I emailed the hotel a few days prior to arriving and informed them of our late check-in I did not receive a reply!!  2) There is NO food available after 10pm we were so hungry when we arrived and all that was offered was a sandwich from the sports bar - see photo! After asking the reception staff several times for help (they offered us some of their food from the restaurant which was kind but it did feel like a struggle) very much ""computer says no"" at first. We just feel that the hotel needs to be more accommodating/flexible with guests in these circumstances.  3) When we arrived after 10pm after our flight and travels we were not offered a drink we had to join a queue at check-in just didn't feel welcoming especially after being so tired after our flight etc. Maybe our experience would have been different if we checked in within 'normal hours' but for a hotel like this we would have expected more especially since I emailed the hotel too!  4) Staff didn't seem empowered or too knowledgable e.g we got booked in to the a-la-carte restaurant on a Tuesday eve but later we realised that the restaurant was closed on Tuesdays so it caused a bit of frustration in rebooking. The reception staff should have known that the restaurant was closed on a Tuesday and should have told us! They rearranged it last minute on the Monday night for us (luckily we hadn't had dinner yet!) but when we got to the restaurant they turned us away saying that we hadn't booked. The restaurant staff then walked with us to reception realised that they had changed our booking and finally allowed us back into the restaurant... so not the best service experience.  5) Not enough staff at breakfast and meal times as we were waiting for our drinks orders to be taken or served our drinks took ages! Staff looked rushed off their feet.    Pro's:  1) Nice relaxing hotel and vibe  2) Gym and Spa are lovely! - the Hammam was gorgeous!  3) Food is decent - although the hotel could cater for the non-alcoholic drinkers a bit more in the restaurants. Would have been nice to have a 'cafe' area for those who wanted a chilled environment and coffee's instead of alcohol.  4) Rooms are cosy and a very good size  5) Free shuttle service into Marrakech Medina - this was our highlight!    Maybe we just got unlucky! but not sure I would rebook here especially for the ¬£¬£ paid vs service received.",Date of stay: December 2022,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SPPH

The food is very nice but quite repetitive. We went in December and the weather was lovely. The staff are all lovely and the activities team do a good job getting people involved in the little activities done through out the day. Don't bother getting a swim up pool because it's like ice didn't go in it at all.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,ian_waring wrote a review Dec 2022,50,Yes I would go back,Above Expectations was unsure about this holiday due religion However there were no concerns if you paid respect and observed their faith then we found it was more relaxed. The Hotel like all hotels they are located in let's say baron areas but inside are great.  The hotel is clean and well presented and the staff can't do enough for you    The sauna area is well run and has what you would expect and the price is about eight go for one of the deals then you have access to the indoor pool area all the time.    The outside area has 2 pools a quiet one and the activities Pool for Animations team use for water aerobics but just usable for all and the team are not pushy with any of the activities they put on    The Bars there are 4 bars that were open at different times to suit the day  All were well run and the Snack bar served food after 10am to 6pm    The Sports Bar was open from 5pm for drinks and pool table football and board games plus TV for Football coverage    The lobby bar has an area for acts and an indoor sitting area and a out outside area with heaters for the cold nights Must mention 2 of the staff here were excellent throughout our week was Sara and Azdine    The pool bar was well stocked so you could just swim up for a drink.    The Room was spacious and in good order with a safe and was cleaned every day.    The weather while we were there over the Xmas week was 23 to 25 degrees clear sky's    The restaurant was a very good size and staff were friendly and ready to assist with water or alcohol and the food was excellent throughout our stay whether it was breakfast lunch or dinner    Marrakesh Town is like Marmite so all I would say is they like to barter but if you try and be greedy they can get over excited so my tip if it's what you would pay in your market and you get a better price here then go ahead its how they make their living.    There are lots on offer outside your hotel like visits to different activities such as quad's camel rides safari jeeps Golf lots of courses all at different prices you can book with hotel or through you rep if you have one or just use the internet and search and seek out the best prices your self.

For those who don‚Äôt drink alcohol and still want a nice drink the hotel have mocktails available that were served at the bar throughout the day.    If you have any issues for whatever reason or need anything reception staff were available 24/7. They were really helpful.    The hotel have a cash machine if you need to take out extra money when you are there on holiday they also have a currency exchange option there if you need exchange your money.    We also booked our excursion with the hotel staff whose name was Mehdi and we went to Atlas Mountain organised by him which was planned properly and we had a fabulous time.    My highlight was the spa at the hotel (you have to lay for the services) however it was totally worth it!    I definitely recommend this fantastic place it was such a lovely time for us.

They refused to provide us with a late check out because they had already granted that request to another room which we were associated with.    Bear in mind. That room was on the other block and they obviously witness their own disturbance. We had paid for a swim up room which was quite a way away from the usual rooms. Just because we were a groupie of friends we were not seen as individuals who paid as individuals and should be treated as individuals.    I was actually fuming at their explanation at the front desk. I actually paid the most for this accommodation due to the upgraded room. I asked to check the availability of the room for late check out and they advised me that the room is actually available but for 600dr (¬£50). Therefore the reason for not honouring our request through the complaint isn‚Äôt because the room is booked for another guest but simply because they have already authorised 1 out of 4 rooms.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Elaine F wrote a review Dec 2022,50,Absolutely Great Hotel. Highly Recommended,I went here with my partner at the end of November for one week. We went with easyJet holidays and everything ran smoothly. Transfer from airport to hotel was only 20 minutes. Check in was quick. You do have to leave a deposit and pay hotel tax for the government but this is fairly inexpensive and they accept debit or credit card if like me you have no Dirhams. The porter showed us to our room and took our bags. The room was lovely with large bathroom with large walk in shower and bath tub with another shower over. Bed was huge. It was ultra clean. I tipped the porter a couple of English Pounds. They take pounds cos they can change them but nothing less. As it was dark when we arrived it was about 9pm we couldn't see much. We ate at the buffet restaurant which is open until 10pm. The food there is really good especially the Moroccan section. And the service by all the waiting on staff impeccable. The Hotel during the day is spotlessly clean. The livelier pool is heated to a perfect temperature and the animation team are doing a great job. On check in you are given towel vouchers and so you get a huge towel from the animation desk. The hotel offers a regular shuttle bus to Marrakech with several pick up and drop off times. Reception are really friendly and very informative about best ways to get to tourist spots. The hotel management is very hands on. You often found the manager helping out in areas when it was busy. The staff at the snack bar are great. Even knocking up special cocktails not on the menu. Food at snack bar is excellent too and they are happy to do things that aren't on the menu. The chef there is hilarious - chat with him if you get a chance. I took part in several things around the pool - piquant archery aqua aerobics beer pong table tennis poker mini golf. All great fun and fab atmosphere. Lobby bar gets busy at night. But the staff work very hard in there. And the sports bar was great. They have board games and a pool table and table football. As World Cup was on then it got busy in there and atmosphere when Morocco played was unbelievable. The barman despite being busy noticed when anyone's drinks were finished and straightaway you had a fresh drink. He even knew after a couple of days what I drank and as soon as I sat down brought it over! Such service üòä. You must book the a la carte restaurant. Absolute fine dining Moroccan style. You can choose from 3 menus which you order before hand. My partner and I ordered different menus but it was all divine. Especially recommend the small Chicken with saffron. Gorgeous. Our waiter was Mourad and he was absolutely spot on with his table service. He explained the dishes and how they were made. There is a lute player on the stage to set the atmosphere which made it very romantic. Our wine glasses were constantly topped up. Great night. I was going to do a massage at the spa but didn't have enough time. I did go into see the spa it looked amazing and treatment was reasonably priced. And guests I spoke to who had used it only had positive things to say. Housekeeping in the hotel is meticulous. And our housekeeper surprised us everyday by making beautiful patterns using the runner and even fanning out my nightdress. Would I go back? Definitely. The atmosphere in the hotel is just good vibes. I never heard anyone complaining.,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elaineannef2016

We are staying for 3 weeks and allocated a room overlooking a car park which isn‚Äôt ideal for a long stay. We paid extra to ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Tarazilla wrote a review Dec 2022,30,Not a 5* hotel,If you‚Äôre a seasoned luxury traveller looking for a 5* holiday don‚Äôt stay here. It is not a real luxury hotel depending on what you‚Äôre used to.    This is a 3* hotel with 4* aesthetics overall 3.5* at best. Customer service can be completely non-existent at times and directly rude and aggressive at others (special shout out to the sports bar manager who was particularly awful). Food is hit or miss in terms of quality and variety.    As an all inclusive there is ZERO food between 12-1pm and after 10pm. Yes that‚Äôs right: you cannot find ANYTHING to eat after 10pm. If you complain Reception will tell you to waste your time looking for online delivery options and then laugh at you when you say you can‚Äôt find anything after 20 mins of searching because no one delivers to the hotel. It‚Äôs in the middle of nowhere. We found others stalking the halls in distress looking for food later in the evenings. I‚Äôve never seen anything like it: especially at an all inclusive! No crisps no nuts nothing. Drinks are watered down heavily as other reviewers have commented.    Saleh in reception could do with some customer service training and probably shouldn‚Äôt be client-facing. We were upgraded as we were treated so poorly on arrival.    The hotel is very clean and the rooms are nice. Note the pool view rooms don‚Äôt come with views if you sit on the terrace as the terrace wall is too high. Garden view rooms are actually car park views with a hedge blocking the cars. It‚Äôs worth staying upstairs for privacy. The bed mattresses were very comfortable but the pillows and duvets were cheap. Bring toiletries: the hotel shampoo and shower gel are poor quality and conditioner isn‚Äôt offered.    The spa is very good (but needs repair) and the hot stone massage was excellent. You‚Äôll be offered a ‚Äúspecial discounted price‚Äù which is in fact just the correct price as hotel guests get 10% discount on spa prices! They should leave bottles of water out.    Special shout out to the team around the heated pool though. Those guys were so friendly and nice. They were the only staff in the hotel who seemed to like having guests around!    If you‚Äôre looking for an actual 5* all inclusive holiday Egypt has actual 5* options by the sea for the same price or less. If you understand this is a 3.5* hotel and adjust your expectations accordingly you‚Äôll be fine and enjoy it.,Date of stay: December 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tarazilla

It is a bit tired in decorating and needs updating. It is on the outskirts of Marrakesh so you have to rely on the shuttle bus or taxi if you want to go anywhere. The hotel has nothing around it so is quiet and very relaxing. The food is varied and caters to everyone‚Äôs taste. It‚Äôs excellent. We had a lovely lady called Fatima who cleaned our room. We always looked forward to going to our room to see what lovely artistic patterns she made from the towels and rose petals. Lovely  I really think this is a 4* hotel and it would have to be all inclusive as nobody would go to this hotel otherwise. On the other hand the staff are friendly and helpful.,Date of stay: December 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/541tammyj

Hotel is beautiful spotlessly clean - cleaners clean constantly. From the minute we got off the bus to getting back on to return to return to the airport home we were made to feel so welcome by all the staff at the hotel.    Food - gorgeous and lots of choices we enjoyed all our meals in the main restaurant and the snack bar. The waiting staff in the main restaurant and the snack bar are all really friendly and hard working.    Drinks - the drinks are great cocktails are lovely spirits are fine - not like the local spirits in some places we have stayed and the lads enjoyed the local Stork lager.    Mustafa (sorry if spelt wrong) - is so friendly and kept us in lovely drinks and special cocktails each night while we were in the sports bar.    Bar waiter in the main bar ( sorry cant remember his name) - was so fun and kept our drinks flowing while we watched the nightly entertainment    Entertainment staff around the pool are amazing - made our holiday. Dont know all of their names ( or how to spell them correctly) - Tetif ( sorry if spelt wrong) Sam and Emma never stop and are so friendly and fun to spend the time around the pool with - they really did make our holiday.    We will definately be back    Thank you to everyone who made our holiday so enjoyable,Date of stay: November 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Odyssey47630774364

The food selection is good for an all inclusive and the alcohol selection is superb.    At the night entertainment if you were seen looking for a table as it was always full a member of staff will instantly bring you table and chairs.    We had the swim up lane room and it did not disappoint. We wanted a night away from the entertainment so we sat in the swim up pool watching the stars above listening to the extremely calm and relaxing soft music which is played until about 10pm and then the main entertainment will start.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Janice012 wrote a review Nov 2022,20,NIce Hotel but deposit not refunded,This is a great hotel with helpful staff excellent food good entertainment and many amenities. The gym is well appointed and the free shuttle bus to Marrakesh is very useful.  However when I arrived on 1 October I was charged 800.80 MAD (approximately ¬£86.80) as a deposit and was assured that this would be refunded when I checked out on 15 October. I presented my card on checkout and was told that my deposit had been refunded. When I got my statement from my bank a few days later I noted that I had not received a refund.  I contacted the hotel through my travel agent Broadway Travel and sent documentary evidence to show that no refund had been received. They contacted the hotel on my behalf and the hotel said that the refund had been made and to check my bank. My bank confirmed that no refund had been received. Broadway Travel contacted the hotel again but to date I have not received a reply nor a refund.  It is now 4 weeks since I returned from this hotel and I am still waiting for my deposit to be refunded. If I had received a refund and a proper response from the hotel I would have awarded 5 stars but this incident has marred an excellent holiday.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,d l wrote a review Nov 2022,20,I don‚Äôt make reviews BUT!,I wasn‚Äôt going to make this review.    The First night I was violently sick to the point I started over heating shaking and sweating. I was on the toilet having diarrhoea till I randomly projectile vomited which landed on my PJs and was sick on the toilet. over a few hours coming back n forth from my bed to the toilet having my body push every last thing out my body. This happened on 3 rounds from around 1am-4am. On the 2nd round it was the worst as that‚Äôs when the over heating kicked in and I didn‚Äôt know what was going on with me or where I was so I kind of blanked out and panicked until I understood my surroundings. I didn‚Äôt wake my partner up because I didn‚Äôt want her to panic. I stayed in my room until around 2-3pm the next day. My partner was worried but I told her to carry on with her day and that I‚Äôll be fine. Later that day around 6pm I told the reception desk about my food poisoning and asked if I could get my PJs washed and they tried to charge me to wash them I didn‚Äôt want to pay so I now have a pair of sick designed Pjs.    The 2nd night I tried to avoid most things for dinner and only ate a piece of bread n a bit of pizza. My partner was fine with what she ate but was also cautious from me being violently sick.    I am here for 3 nights. Today the 3rd night wasn‚Äôt so bad I could Bear it But I SHOULDN‚ÄôT have eaten the MEAT! I was stuck to the toilet at 2am n 8:30am for over 30 minutes as I had severe diarrhoea (was on the phone watching tiktok while letting it all out) and straight after me my partner was sick in the toilet from food poisoning (9am). Around 11am at the toilet she told me to call the reception desk and ask for more toilet roll and to offer to pay for a late checkout or even an extra night here as she feels too sick to fly back home today 10/11/2022. The stuff said we can‚Äôt do a late check out as they‚Äôre fully booked and can‚Äôt so an extra night which I understand but telling me ‚Äúyou can continue to use our facilities‚Äú like it‚Äôs something extra you‚Äôre giving us?    Don‚Äôt get me WRONG! The Hotel is LOVELY and the staff are nice to you until you TELL THEM ABOUT FOOOD POISONING. if you‚Äôre lucky to not get food poisoning you‚Äôll have a LOVELY TIME!    From an alleged 5* hotel you would think they would be more attentive to our needs and if a customer is sick but NO. WE‚ÄôVE FELT PUSHED TO THE SIDE.    BACKSTORY  I‚Äôve spent over ¬£1k for a quick random 3 night stay because we‚Äôve recently found out we‚Äôve miscarried our first child (25/10/2022 - 01/11/2022). Work gave us 2 weeks off and I couldn‚Äôt watch her looking lost and empty inside as it really made me feel useless so I booked us a quick holiday to try and ease the pain a bit better. This is why when I was first sick from food poisoning on Monday (07/11/2022) I didn‚Äôt want to wake her up and worry her about me being sick. This experience hasn‚Äôt been good. I don‚Äôt know this holiday worked but it definitely took her mind off the miscarriage just a really odd way of doing it.    REASONS WHY I WROTE THIS REVIEW:  At first I wasn‚Äôt going to write this until the response or lack of response we received and none care given.  1. First night I was sick and told staff at reception about my food poisoning and needing my PJs washed. Staff was shocked and then tried to charge me to have my PJs watched.  2. 9:20am 10/11/2022 i approached the reception desk and brought them to the side and stated that my partner has food poisoning and that if they have anything to help her out. The reception told me to go to the gift shop and ask them as they didn‚Äôt have anything to help us with.  3. I called on the day of checkout (11:25 10/11/2022) to either pay a late checkout fee or an extra night due to my partner being severely sick from food poisoning. Staff was none understanding - and requested that we leave the room at 12 because they‚Äôre fully booked and didn‚Äôt offer to help.  4. 12:18 pm 10/11/2022 my partner is still toilet bound and reception calls our room asking us to leave. I explain that we can‚Äôt leave because my partner is toilet bound and she could vomit or diarrhoea at any moment - they‚Äôve transferred our call and we explain to someone else. 12:30 we had a nurse attend our room to give us medicine to help with the sickness. I‚Äôm just upset with how this was dealt with and treated.    This is why I have given it a 2 star rating - even though the food poisoning ruined my whole time. The hotel looked lovely and clean (in places that were public/visible) and they carried out maintenance work and the staff was lovely if you were well. Rooms were good and spacious. If I hadn‚Äôt had the food issue I would given it a high 4 and been satisfied.    The first night was the worst sickness I‚Äôve ever experienced having food poisoning. MINUS THE FOOD - ITS A LOVLY PLACE AND THE STAFF ARE WONDERFUL if you don‚Äôt get sick.

What more could you want?!,Arrived just before 3pm and offered food.. we declined and went to our room. Staff so friendly from the outset. Room huge and everything you could want. Yes you can see the bathroom from the bedroom but the toilet is separate (phew!!)    Food..  Amazing!! So much choice.. buffet you get lamb turkey lots of fish with cous cous rice salads potatoes and the best AI desserts we've had! If you just want chips you can get these at the snack bar but the other food was literally the best I've had since a sandals holiday which says a lot bearing in mind the price difference! Hussan in the restaurant was so so good! He preempted our needs so fast efficient and we noticed when he wasn't around. Breakfast was good. Service there was really hit and miss.. one girl ignored my requests for coffee and served elsewhere but when my husband asked for his second time! But i wasn't fussed re coffee or tea so decided best not to ask at breakfast. That said she was the only member of the staff that wasn't 100% on the ball. Azdine on the lobby bar must run through trainers like nobody's business. He does not stop. Friendly and fab!!! That man deserves a medal    Entertainment team.. FABULOUS!

Butler service is not good no service around the pools only 1 bartender per station so order more than one drink once you make it through the line. The a la carte service was great! I must say buffet not so much served our own coffee at breakfast once I found the pots and the milk was spoiled from the day before!! No juice to be found.

I absolutely love this hotel. The staff are all so friendly  there‚Äôs plenty going on in the day if you want to get involved but you are certainly not harassed by the entertainment team. We made use of the spa this time and booked a 2 day treatment and it was amazing and such good value.    The evening entertainment is good some nights quite chilled other there‚Äôs a dj and dancing for those who fancy it.    The food is lovely you can tell the chef and his team really care about what they serve up and there are always plenty of seats in the restaurant the pool bar serves lovely snacks to order too.    We spent most out time round the square pool  As they play music which we preferred. There are loads of beds and certainly no rush to get up and reserve them: the other pool is just as nice with its pool bar but we just preferred the other.    Rooms are lovely roomy and great air con and the WiFi is brill never struggled with signal once.    I went out to the souks markets on my first visits so gave it a miss this time. If you venture there the hotel run a free bus but beware of the men waiting as you get off claiming to be guides from the hotel they are not and will demand money for helping you.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,TashaHibbert wrote a review Nov 2022,40,A (long) honest but fair review of Be Live Collection from a Northern couple in their late-20s.,I feel a little conflicted writing this one as we can both say we throughly enjoyed our holiday but just not for 10 whole nights. The resort is beautiful in so many ways but also does have some little flaws. If I could headline this review it would be to book for 5-7 nights and no more.    The swim up rooms are beautiful I can‚Äôt fault these and the plus side we made some great friends around our room. I would really recommend paying the extra for this.    The thing that really makes this resort great is the staff and they really do go that extra mile for you. We would really like to thank Azdine as he does a fantastic job your drinks are on the table before you‚Äôve finished your first ordered remembered every time. Please tip this man as he deserves a medal purely for the amount of steps he must do in one evening. Be Live management please pass on our thank yous to Azdine.    The grounds and resort are very well maintained by hard working grounds staff/maintenance/cleaners who clearly take a lot of pride in their work.    The biggest (and only) gripe for us was the food we did really struggle with finding an efficient meal very fish heavy and similar offerings each day. You can book into the A la carte restaurant - something we didn‚Äôt try as the menu wasn‚Äôt to our taste. Also do plan to eat else where perhaps out of the resort on a Tuesday & Sunday as this is when the A La carte restaurant is shut which I believe takes the stress of the main buffet. We couldn‚Äôt get seated in the main restaurant on these days from 7-9:45pm and there really wasn‚Äôt any food left when we did even the pizza and pasta. The restaurant does need more staff to deal with the amount of guests the staff are working tirelessly to serve collect drink orders and clear down tables ready for the following guests. Unfortunately just not enough of them to do so. We resorted to cleaning and setting our own tables on occasion.    The snack bar you think would be a nice break away from the restaurant with a more simple offering off food. Sadly a chicken ceaser salad consisted off 2 chicken nuggets on lettuce and a chicken burger again 2 chicken nuggets in some sweet bread - add this to very very slow service is frustrating but can‚Äôt be blamed on the staff just the lack of. Honestly friendly staff just over run with that being the only bar that side of the resort.    You‚Äôre a little out of the way in this resort something we did enjoy being out of the hustle and bustle. Which makes the shuttle bus very handy. The times are a little irrational but clearly advertised so we did have to book a taxi on a couple of occasions. Booking through the hotel was very easy and efficient but returning home relying on Marrakesh taxis not so much so please do bare this in mind and try to plan your day around the shuttle bus times.    The pool side day time entertainment team on these reviews seem to be quite positive something I would personally disagree with. They are very clearly drawn to a certain kind of person unfortunately I‚Äôm not blessed with long legs and a toned stomach which meant I wasn‚Äôt really asked to get involved. On one occasion I did sign myself up-to beer pong I physically had a drink taken off me and passed to a more attractive lady. Overall I‚Äôm not too fussed about this experience with the entertainment team as it‚Äôs not what I was there for but something to be mindful off and verging on slightly offensive at times. It would be nice if the team could be inclusive of all people of all shapes and sizes. On the contrary the evening entertainment staff are very inclusive and can‚Äôt be faulted we had some great evenings with this team.    The evening entertainment we throughly enjoyed the first week a nice mix of everything. The live band was fantastic DJ night a great lively evening and you can‚Äôt beat karaoke night. But by week 2 you‚Äôre furiously resisting the whole playlist for the evening. The set list needs mixing up at the risk of hearing Sweet Caroline one more time. I think this needs to be on a 2-weekly cycle rather than what seems a 5-day cycle.    The only frustration with the evening entertainment would be that for an adults only hotel the bar shutting and (literally) lights off for 12pm is too early they do such a great job at getting everyone up and active to have a great time and then by 12pm you‚Äôre expected to be in bed and lights off and not a peep of noise made. Every evening the team are fighting with huge groups of people chanting ‚Äúone more song‚Äù - take the hint here Be Live and extend those hours slightly. 10pm - 12pm for evening entertainment just doesn‚Äôt cut it. Possibly extend even just 1/2 days out of the week to please all guests?    The last thing that needs mentioning and the most frustrating one of all the flies are absolutely relentless around this resort and there seems to be no measures in place to manage this. I understand the country we was in but a few measures wouldn‚Äôt go a miss.    Over-all I would really recommend this resort which we have done to friends and family only in our opinion for no longer than a week (and if your taste buds are a little more mature/adventurous than what ours seems to be). We did throughly enjoy our holiday up-to night 6/7 to stay longer you would really need to fill your days with excursions.    I would certainly stay at a Be Live resort again possibly somewhere a little more European purely for the food reasons. The staff do go above and beyond for you a little difficult with reception not understanding much English but you can muddle your way through fine.    A very beautiful and accommodating resort if you‚Äôre not their for the food or day-time entertainment and for a relaxing short break away.    Thanks for a great stay Be Live and you have some amazing staff working for you who really do need some recognition just a few things that need a little work but nothing that ruined the holiday.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Burnley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TashaHibbert

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,redding wrote a review Nov 2022,50,23 year old couples review,I have to say I am pleasantly surprised by the hotel itself.    We were anxious at first reading all the reviews but I‚Äôve never felt more safe with the directory and mannerisms of everyone (StaffCustomers and even the cats!)    Food was a 7/10 each day of the week differed and only one of the 7 days was shocking.    Entertainment was great except the DJ I agree with most it was probably better to leave to Spotify    Staff 10/10 (100/10 for Azdine never left us with an empty glass and always did it with a smile)    Overall 8/10 holiday  Would recommend any couples to take a week out in the sun!,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Uckfield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Voyager45892049568
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,David Bristol wrote a review Nov 2022,30,Good but far from perfect,Ok to make things easy for you disregard the reviews that only talk about the staff from reviewers with a low number of reviews. The hotel rooms and common areas are good enough no more no less.  The entertainment varies between a very good acoustic duo a girl who plays guitar and sings and a guy on keyboard. However this hotel has perhaps the worst DJ I‚Äôve ever heard. He‚Äôs truly awful. Can‚Äôt mix blend fade nothing. Literally be better off with a USB stick.  The food on the whole is good a little repetitive but good enough for a week.  Biggest gripe here are fellow guests particularly the British ones coming back to their rooms at 12.30-1.30 slamming doors and shouting. Happened every single night. Also the ones watching loud videos on phones in the bars and restaurant walking around the buffet eating etc. Have some respect guys. Positives are the place is pretty clean and Azdine the bar man is truly the master of his craft. He deserves a promotion,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bristol, UK",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidBristol

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Leanne2394 wrote a review Oct 2022,40,I enjoyed myself!,We returned from Marrakesh yesterday morning it was a lovely stay and 7 days were just enough. Firstly a big shoutout to Emma Titif and Oussama they were so friendly and they were a breath of fresh air when we saw them every day. All the staff were helpful. We didn‚Äôt go to the Moroccan restaurant on-site we felt like there was enough variety in the buffet. However the buffet was good but there were sometimes names of dishes missing. Although the staff could not do enough for you there just wasn‚Äôt enough of them the pool bar for instance had one very hard working individual working there every day and sometimes you could wait for a long period of time if it was busy to get a drink. There was a fantastic drinks runner in the lounge bar he was definitely the hardest working individual at that hotel. All week he provided us with fabulous service (sorry I didn‚Äôt remember his name) I also felt like he could have done with someone helping him collect glasses and run the drinks. Breakfast in the buffet was the worst service out of the three meal times. I had no tea or coffee offered for half of the mornings I were there. I asked one morning and I didn‚Äôt get any teabags that service did not seem to be as structured as the others. The entertainment was good throughout the day and night although Thursday night DJ‚Äôn was not me. However other than the staffing the holiday was good. Just a piece of advice the people at the hotel who sell you the excursions I would recommend going elsewhere there was very little information provided and I actually paid for an excursion and didn't know everything that I had paid for because we were not told. I would definitely return to see the lovely faces of those we spoken to in the hotel. There is so much more I could say but I recommend a visit I‚Äôve left thinking about the hard working staff and how they would make you smile each day not that I had to wait a some time to order a drink. It‚Äôs luxury the rooms are gorgeous we was luckily in the Sahara block so we would hear no noise from the entertainment if we went to bed early. The spa and the staff in the spa were a fabulous 10/10. The treatments are fairly priced and they were very accommodating. It says that the pool was heated but it was not when I went in.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Halesowen, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leanne2394

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,angelikaSolihull wrote a review Oct 2022,30,Not 5 star,I had to really think about this review as not everything was perfect but overall we were happy.  We didn‚Äôt get off to a good start as our flight was delayed and when we finally got to the hotel after a long journey there weren‚Äôt any refreshments at all on offer and another long wait as there was only one member of staff on duty for the check in. There were only six couples we were last in line and had to wait nearly an hour. The best they could offer was a taxi into town to get some food at our own cost.Then no help was offered to find the room or with our luggage. We also had to put a credit card as a deposit for towels and possible damage which Tui had not informed us about.  Our room was good spacious very comfortable large twin beds a modern bathroom with a bath and a good shower. The maid service was great she cleaned the room to a high standard.The view was awful though a building site and the sports bar. We were offered a swap  but as I had unpacked at that point and the hotel was quite outstretched it seemed to much trouble.  The pools were good all be it a little neglected. Some tiles were missing and the handrail was unstable. There are two pools a quiet pool with a swim up bar and a pool with music and activities. Plenty of sun beds  again some needed upgrading. Generally all round the hotel there was evidence of a lack of investment.  The buffet was good some labelling missing but the food was nice plenty of choices for every taste. Some hygiene questions mainly over the behaviour of some guests.  Service was ok the staff worked tirelessly but not enough of them. Sometimes there was a lengthy wait for tea and coffee.  The Moroccan specialty restaurant wasn‚Äôt great nice ambiance but the food was not so good.  The evening entertainment was good a band with quieter music till ten then another singer or DJ till midnight. The service here was hit and miss as there was only one waiter working and he worked incredibly hard. The drinks were definitely watered down and there was quite a wait at the bar.  The shuttle service is good and reliable.  The use of plastic was shocking!  All in all we had a good holiday the hotel is definitely not 5 star probably more a 3 star and we‚Äôve been to quite a few similar hotels for a similar price.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Solihull, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelikaSolihull

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Orange1992 wrote a review Oct 2022,30,A pleasant stay,Rooms: we booked a suite and were impressed with the size of the room along with the facilities and comfort. Towels & sheets changed every other day (personally think this is good no need for changing everyday) room unfortunately not serviced every day I presume due to the hotel being busy so potentially the need more room staff wasn‚Äôt an issue for us as we‚Äôre clean and tidy. On days where the room was serviced it was lovely however often there was a knock at the door bringing something later on: pillow cases hand towels. No iron in the room. Need to call for one they must only keep a few across the hotel as we waited an hour and a half (and called more than once) for it to arrive we ironed all our clothes then so we didn‚Äôt need to ask for it again. Water not left in the room on our second day so we ensured we took plenty back with us from the pool / restaurant.  Pools: you have the choice of two pools; one has music and activities throughout the day the other has no music and has a swim up bar. Both pools have plenty of sun beds. Neither pool is heating they are like plunge pools but lovely when you‚Äôve been in the sun.  Gym: well fitted out nicely cool with towels & water available.  Sports bar: played any football games requested across one large screen and a smaller one too includes a pool table and games. Comfortable seating. No alcoholic beverages served before 5pm but can take drinks from the other bars in with you.  Pool bar: for drinks and snacks we didn‚Äôt utilise as we sat at the pool with the swim up bar.  Al a carte restaurant: the menu is set and limited to chicken beef or vegetarian both my husband and I were not impressed with the meal served (ordered beef & vegetarian) we were allowed a second visit during our stay but opted not to do so.  Buffet restaurant: the food overall is average the dishes are badly labelled or not labelled at all no markers for meat / veggie / diary / gluten etc. the chefs were helpful and helped identify what was / wasn‚Äôt vegetarian but it would definitely be better use of their time if the dishes were clearly labelled. Rather than waiting to be seated you seat yourselves (no issues with that) but the staff don‚Äôt seem to be able to keep up with the table turnaround we had our drinks order taken at 1 out of 8 breakfasts. This is nothing against the staff they definitely were not slacking they simply couldn‚Äôt keep up with the number of guests.  Drinks: spirits & cocktails are watered down massively wine beer & mocktails were lovely.  Evening entertainment: this was done really well it gets busy but the staff are happy to bring tables & chairs down from the pool bar table service was slow and orders missed / forgotten but again it was simply one member of staff running round taking orders collecting glasses and bringing drinks out! Music is loud and if you have you a pool facing room (back of hotel) and sleep lightly remember your earplugs or stay up and get involved until it‚Äôs over. There were two different singers on throughout our stay both of which had lovely voices.  Staff: overall good it does generally feel understaffed. The staff (when they have the time) are accommodating and provided a service with a smile on their face throughout our stay. I‚Äôm not sure what staff get for their names being mentioned in Trip Advisor reviews (did ask but staff just said it was good) but there are a group who are insistent you leave one and mention their name staff offering for you to hotspot from their phone just to post a review there and then this was a nuisance and is something they should be trained in differently or discouraged in doing.  Wi-Fi: dips in and out quite a lot but when it works was sufficient for phone not so good on laptop.    We did not use the spa so no comments to leave.    Single use of plastic is really shocking bar wine & beer every drink is served with a plastic straw. During the day all drinks are served in small plastic cups with no encouragement to refill the cup you‚Äôve just used.    Non hotel related comments:  Coming through customs was like a game of 21 questions glad they‚Äôre doing the job thoroughly.  There are an obscene amount of flies if you are coming bring a fly swat with you.  Please women dress for the culture of the country you are visiting not where you are from. In the hotel you‚Äôre fine but remember this when venturing out.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Rob wrote a review Oct 2022,50,Great place to relax,The check in process was easy. The room was nice and clean very spacious with a nice area to sit outside and catch some morning sun. The ladies who clean the rooms do an excellent job.    The food is great. I had read some negative reviews so I was pleasantly surprised. The buffet offers a wide variety of foods each day. The food is well presented and the bread is freshly baked. If you miss the breakfast buffet then you can go to the snack bar and get an omelette or something else. There was nice coffee at the lobby bar.    We spent most of our time at the quiet pool as we were both reading books. It has a swim up bar and that was a nice way to cool down and grab a drink. The drinks are very small and don't contain much alcohol which is a little frustrating but understandable as people would definitely be very drunk if they were normal measures. That being said if you ask for a double they'll give you one. A small tip goes a long way.    The Moroccan restaurant was okay. It would be better if there was more choice than just the three set menus given. The atmosphere is lovely the staff very polite and attentive and the musician was terrific the food was good but just a little underwhelming we preferred the buffet.    The beds are incredibly comfortable and it was so lovely to be able to fall asleep so easily.    Overall it was a very enjoyable and relaxing stay.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Jess R wrote a review Oct 2022,40,Short solo trip,Short solo 5 day break    I was traumatised arriving at the airport you exit the airport into what I can only describe as a boxing ring with about 300 men standing around with names on bits of paper just my luck i couldn't find my driver but I did approach a gentleman who kindly rang my taxi man    Short journey to the hotel which was brilliant very quick check in you won't be allowed into your room till 3 even if the rooms are ready so make sure you have swim wear at hand in your hand luggage but full use of facility's from arrival until your taxi picks up on departure    I had a swim up room these rooms don't get the sun till 12ish. Room was cleaned daily and they were spacious unfortunately i had to move on the second night because of the noise of the elephant above when reception called them they decided to ramp the noise up even more they clearly needed to get 50000 steps in until 2am im not sire rhwy even left there room i had head phones on and white noise and still heard it  Reception staff were brilliant and moved me  I had a couple of cocktails very watered down couldn't taste a thing the resturant is small there is a small variety of food which is to be expected as its a small hotel but the food was lovely and you'll always find something  Snacks at pool bar as well you won't go hungry  Bottles of water at all bars  You have 2 pools one with music and entertainment which everyone enjoyed or a quiet pool where you can lay in peace  Now the spa I paid for a pedicure ¬£40 absolutely awful  ¬£60 massage this wasn't a massage it was a rub very disappointing experience  This holiday is what you make it my experience won't be yours  I didn't rate this a 5 star because its not ve only rated 3 because I cant give 3.5 I didn't get the wow factor on arrival didn't get a welcome drink and biscuit on arrival there wasn't a laundry service like in 5 star hotels wasn't allowed late check out for 2 hours even though there were empty rooms I could of used i was also missed at breakfast a couple of times to be offered a coffee don't get me wrong every member of staff here always had a smile and they all work very hard but for the money I paid I could of gone to another 5 star with better facility's  You will have a nice time here I came here for peace and to relax and that's what I left with  You will have a lovely time and the weather is beautiful.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Horsham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessr954

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Beth9332 wrote a review Oct 2022,40,Chilled week,We visited as a group of 3. Mother daughter and good friend.  The hotel itself is only around 20 mins from the airport which makes it very appealing. We came out on a early morning flight and was on our sun loungers by 11am.  I would recommend keeping some swimwear in your hand luggage tho as you can‚Äôt have your room till 3pm but can use all other facilities.  Oussama and Titi were a credit to the hotel with there positive vibes. Friendly and encouraging with activities. Making sure everyone is invited to participate but not been pushy if you don‚Äôt want to.  There was more then enough sun loungers the week we were there probably a good 1/3 empty on even the busiest days. No rush to get a towel to reserve early either.  The reason I wouldn‚Äôt give this hotel 5* is because of the drinks. The selection is good however they are all served in small plastic cups once you get a few ice cubes in you only get half a dozen mouth fulls of drink- if your lucky. The amount of plastic each person must use on a holiday is crazy as they are all single use cups. I always found Tariq at the outside bar a helpful friendly man.  My only gripe I had with staff was the supervisor looking man that would over see the bars- outside and inside. While we were there there was a large group of golfers. He pandered to them and was handed tips in return. Serving them drinks before everyone else. On more then a few occasions there was large queues at the bar and he would go behind the bar with a large order. Take one of the staff to make the 10 drinks and then he would pocket the tip! You could tell the bar staff were embarrassed doing this.  Food was good. Always plenty of choice.  The rooms were spotless and all areas of the hotel were too to be fair.  Also a shout out to the two guest relations ladies one of which gave us a tour on our first day the others helped us to organise a  Taxi many thanks!,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Scunthorpe, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beth9332
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Peter W wrote a review Oct 2022,30,Not 5 Star !! Don‚Äôt be fooled . Very disappointing.,One week break in October ! Chose this hotel because of rating and all inclusive nature .  Good points :  Staff on the whole pleasant  attentive and friendly .  Housekeeping to a high standard and cleanliness to a high standard .  Buffet offered wide choice and dining room well serviced by staff to accommodate needs    Not so good :    There is no concept whatsoever of a no smoking policy . Smoking in corridors to rooms and at pool side and in all outside sitting areas means that we were exposed constantly to smoking . The room we occupied smelled of smoke and the two adjoining swimming rooms were occupied by smokers and smokers sat around pool . Don‚Äôt visit if you are a non smoker . Would be better if the management designated some areas of hotel as non smoking and some areas of pool and pool bar etc    There is no food available for Late flight arrivals . We arrived at 23.30 and were not welcomed merely checked in and left to sort out ourselves . Out of hours welcome could be better and hospitable  no welcome drink etc    The hotel environment is tired and the fabric of the building is in need of updates in many places  veneers coming off furniture etc NOT 5 star    Whilst wide variety of food the restaurant was a times chaotic  restaurant opened without all food choices available. Neither the restaurant not bars enforced the dress code policy meaning evening dining with intoxicated loud guests    Wasn‚Äôt expecting to be relaxing in a hotel which had its gardens / landscape being revamped . The photos say it all  trying to relax for two days running ! Yesterday was Bulldozers  today constant squeaking wheelbarrows and soul was not what we expected and the hotel management were not helpful when this was raised with them    Tried to raise with Reception but didn‚Äôt seem bothered or interested .

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Michelle B wrote a review Oct 2022,40,Birthday Week Away!,We are on our last day of a weeks holiday at Be Live and we have had a lovely week here.  Checkin was easy we got here early and couldn't go to our rooms till 3pm but we were given our all inclusive wrist bands and had some food drink and used the pool until we could get to our room.  The rooms are lovely and clean very spacious and the cleaners make sure this is done daily. We have had regular mini toilettries and tea and coffee (other than first day we have had to request milk if we wanted in our room)  The food here is fine you won't go hungry Breakfast is eggs sausage toast fruit cakes etc (not English breakfast but we are in Morocco) snack bar we have had burgers pizza paninis and chips and at night the restaurant serves meats potatoes vegetables etc.  The drinks were lovely for me depends on who you get as to whether there watered down much but I never had no problem and my husband was drinking San Miguel from bottles and always enjoyed it but also the local beer Stork he said was good too.  The hotel does a daily shuttle into town which is a must after reading reviews I was very nervous to go into Marrakesh but I loved it you got to see it when your here.  The one thing for me at this hotel that makes it is certain members of staff they are so happy and helpful all the time Oualid at the pool bar is a credit to this hotel he is such a happy guy and works long hours but from the moment he starts to finishing always has a smile on his face. Youness Omar and Tarik at the snack bar again are such nice members of staff. There are a lot of others as well that work extremely hard which makes this hotel such a nice place to be.  The only reason I have said 4 not 5 stars is small things like the phone not working in the room the milk not been replenished daily small parts of the hotel needing refurbishment but that said we have had a lovely week and would definitely re ommend coming here to see Morocco and the people :),Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Stoke-on-Trent, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/704MichelleB

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Anesu K wrote a review Oct 2022,50,An experience I will cherish forever and probably repeat once or twice over,I was skeptical when I read other reviews but I‚Äôm glad the hotel proved otherwise to reviews.    Staff were very attentive and hardworking. Never had to wait for a drink or food at the snack bar bar or restaurant. The staff were pretty much on point with clearing tables for the next diners. They were helpful and a cheerful bunch. Cleaners receptionist servers and the rest of them. What a wonderful bunch.    Food was a hit and miss but still above average. There was a snack bar buffet and ala carte. Unfortunately did not have the ala carte as it needed to be booked in advance and our stay was not long enough to allow us that. The snack bar had the fast foods type of food which were great and tasty. Loved the Moroccan food at the buffet. There was certainly something for everyone. Loved all the new foods I tried compared to foods I was used to such as pasta.    Was worried the drinks would be watered down but I did not experience this myself. There isn‚Äôt an extensive selection but there is enough drinks on the menu to rotate if you are like me and like variety. Enjoyed the cocktails- mainly the fun on the beach and sunrise‚Ä¶yum.    The hotel itself is gorgeous. The pics do not do it justice. It is beautiful. There are 2 different pools a quiet and another one which plays music and has activities which is the one we preferred.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Jonboy8421 wrote a review Oct 2022,40,Lovely hotel with very few floors,4 night trip 5th to 9th oct    Great stuff:  Few transfers to the markets at various times thru the day - free return.  Great wifi - we were in room 3115 near the very end of the hotel and worked great.  Staff are great and very helpful. If you have a problem then just ask someone as they will sort it. we had a problem with the shower drainage - rang reception and they came and fixed if straight away.  Pool staff are great always trying to get u involved in daily activities (aqua aerobics aqua zumba stretch water polo football poker (for fun) mini golf (with a sand wedge and tennis ball :-) and various other fun games).There is always music being played at this pool. You don't have to get involved and if u want then just go to the quiet pool where there is also a swim up bar.  nice food and fairly good service at the snack bar by the main pool.  good selection of food at the main buffet restaurant all meals.  Food at the a la carte restaurant is beautiful but you only get a limited choice (The beef is stunning - WOW).  Rooms well cleaned and the grounds all beautiful.  Evening entertainment was good on some nights.    Not so great:  Cocktails very syrupy (personal taste - wife wasn't keen but I was - I loved my 100 or so Pina Colada's consumed :-) )  3 of the 4 days it took a while to get coffee at breakfast time - we didn't get until we had finished breakfast. Hot drinks are sent to each table when u sat down but something obviously wrong with the current system as staff were struggling to keep up. On one occasion we asked for coffee 3 times till we finally got. Maybe make this self service.  Service at the pool bar was generally ok but recommend maybe leaving bottles of water in an ice bucket for people to help themselves. This would save loads of queing time for those just wanting water rather than having to wait for people getting served cocktails.  Drinks service was slow at the main bar at night. There was only 1 member of staff serving drinks to the terrace. He was amazing but needed help every night. found ourselves having to order 2 drinks each at a time to keep it flowing.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Amy S wrote a review Oct 2022,30,Major Room For Improvement,Myself and my partner (male and female in our mid-twenties) have just returned from a 7 night stay at this hotel. Overall our stay was average and I would not be planning to return. Unfortunately our cons list outweighed the pros there is room for improvement in this hotel which is far from a 5 star resort.    Pros:  - The hotel itself is lovely with staff cleaning and gardening consistently.    - The rooms are spacious with comfy beds and a good strong shower. (safe and hairdryer included as well as free use of the iron and board from reception)    - The entertainment both during the day and in the evenings was great during the day there are many activities and the staff are always friendly. In the evening there was calmer live music on from 8-10 and from 10 there was a dj belly dancers oriental show karaoke etc all with a great atmosphere and getting the audience involved.    - The food was mostly good. The buffet offers a very french influenced variety which includes fresh bread and pastries every day the snack bar at lunch was very handy as you could eat in swimwear outdoors. The dinner buffet was ok some dishes were cold but as with all all inclusive hotels some nights better than others depending on individual tastes however we never went hungry.    - In the evenings we had a wonderful waiter named Azdine who was very attentive and remembered our drinks order every night.    Cons:  - The buffet areas were often extremely busy which staff seemed to struggle to keep up with which resulted in lots of messy tables from previous guests which could not be used. This is not a reflection on the staff as they worked very hard to keep up but the volume of guests was too much for them.    - The snack bar has the potential to be better too. I love the idea of ordering from a menu and having fresh food made. However we often waited 10-20 minutes just to receive a menu and then have our order taken. I ordered a chicken burger one day which was 2 slabs of bread with 3 chicken nuggets inside. This felt cheap and not as expected for an advertised 5 star.    - The food signs in the buffet need to be evaluated and fast. The signs were often missing or misleading which would be very alarming for a person with any allergies or intolerances. Some signs which indicated a traditional moroccan dish did not name the ingredients included which meant they were often overlooked due to uncertainty.    - There is a huge plastic issue at this hotel. Plastic cups and bottles which were non-reusable were used around the pool all day and for most of the evening from the bar. This is alarming in terms of pollution and recycling and could be easily rectified by using washable and reusable plastic or paper cups. The cups should also be bigger as they often had enough juice for 3-4 sips then they were finished which resulted in us attending at the bar for soft juice in new cups more than we would like.    - We travelled into Marrakesh town on the free bus ran by the hotel (this is a coach transfer which was a very nice touch) however on arrival into Marrakesh our bus driver was speaking to a man outside the bus and told him which hotel we had been brought from. This man then proceeded to pretend to be a Be Live employee and flashed a fake ID badge at us and tried to take us on a tour down some unknown streets. This made us feel unsafe and untrustworthy of the bus driver. Keep this in mind that Be Live do not have a tour guide in Marrakesh.    - One of the major issues of our holiday was at the evening lobby bar where the entertainment was performed. Our drinks were watered down missing alcohol completely or just incorrect on most occasions. We raised these concerns with the bar staff on 3 nights during our 7 night stay and heard a multitude of other groups and couples complaining about the same. We would order 2 vodkas at the bar the staff would ask us to sit down so they could bring them over and when they arrived they were just juice. We quickly realised that we had to watch the drinks be poured to ensure they had completed our order.    - We also had issues with incorrect drinks such as asking for a rum and coke and being given a tequila and coke. We raised this again with staff who told us that ‚Äúrum and tequila are the same thing‚Äù. This was another risk for allergies. There are multiple reviews on trip adviser speaking to similar issues at the bar which I wish I had taken more seriously before paying for our stay here. I would recommend sticking with beer or wine to ensure these are correct.    - Another issue we faced constantly was that when we went to the bar we would often order 2 drinks each to save queuing especially during the shows. The staff were reluctant to give out more than one drink per person and questioned us on this multiple times. On once occasion we were also told ‚Äúthis is your last‚Äù in reference to the last drink we would be able to receive even though the bar was still open.    - Finally when we raised these complaints with the bar manger Achraf he implied that we were lying about the drinks and asked myself (female) ‚Äúdoes your mister think this too‚Äù. This was degrading as a women to feel that only my partners opinion would be respected. I felt as though my concerns were brushed off and that other waiters and bar staff were being told to limit the alcohol given to guests. This being an all inclusive hotel which was not cheap to visit is alarming that drinks are not available and correct. I appreciate that if we had been drunk or disorderly however we were a couple on a quiet holiday enjoying playing cards and sitting in the sunshine there was no excuse to skimp on the drinks.    Overall the negative points have outweighed the positive for us. We still enjoyed our holiday as the weather was great and we are quite easy going people. We will not be planning to return to this hotel and I am unsure if I would consider another Be Live hotel for the fear of finding similar issues.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T9607XGamys

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,CCB wrote a review Oct 2022,20,You get what you pay for‚Ä¶,‚Ä¶which is to say this is a very basic hotel. Do not come expecting anything luxurious. This was my first experience with the brand and I would not recommend it to anyone I care about.    PROS:  - Nice welcome drink and snack upon arrival.  - Spacious and clean room  - The gym had working equipment and attendant and towel service.  - There was an effort to provide daily and nightly entertainment.  - Shuttle service was available (for a fee).  - Reliable Wi-Fi throughout.    CONS:  - No welcome info sent after booking.  - I found conflicting information about airport transportation. I had to reach out to coordinate (only $50 USD for our group of 6).  - Restaurant options are extremely limited basically just a buffer and snack bar. (A restaurant with a la carte options is available for those with a longer stay.) The buffet restaurant is severely understaffed. It‚Äôs self-seating but you have to fight for a clean table. Once you do that you wait for a tablecloth silverware and drink service. On one busy night I was treated to a previously used dirty tablecloth and no drink offered. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre never prepared for the volume despite it being the main dining option.  - No poolside service.  - Slow snack bar service.  - Very limited beverage selection. The mixed drinks were generally not good. I had to give instructions for a Manhattan and that was only tolerable. You can stick with beer or wine but you get only one option for each category (red white rose). You can pay cash for champagne but we didn‚Äôt think it would be worth it.  - There is tea instant coffee and a Nespresso machine in the room. But only two Nespresso pods are complimentary.  - The nightly entertainment can be heard in the room (maybe a pro for some but made it hard for me to sleep).  - The room balcony is too high to enjoy a view while seated (again maybe the privacy is a pro for some).  - There are no designated smoking areas.    The worst part of our stay was in dealing with the concierge. We had spa reservations at another facility. We requested transportation the night before and were given a pickup time and price. When we showed up for our ride the driver was not there and the concierge did not seem concerned. He said he would call the driver no problem and we would not be late. The driver came 20 minutes after the scheduled pick up time and attempted to drop us off at the wrong location. Needless to say we were very late for our spa appointment. After our service I called the hotel to request pickup. 50 minutes later we were still waiting so I called again. A woman told me there was (another) miscommunication but they would send a driver. We waited another two hours and still did not have anyone pick us up. We eventually asked the location for a taxi in order to get back to the hotel. Once we returned and approached the front desk there the response was unbothered and unapologetic. The staff told us that the driver could not pick us up because (1) he couldn‚Äôt get through security (2) no one was waiting in the lobby for a pickup and (3) no one answered the phone. I asked why no one attempted to reach me via phone or email and the staff told us we could take it up with the concierge the next day. This disregard for our well-being was unsafe and disappointing.    Bottom line:  This place may be better suited for younger inexperienced guests but do not venture beyond the property plan ahead for the buffet and limit your drink preferences.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CCGWB

Food and drink is very typical all inclusive if you‚Äôve been to others it‚Äôs very samey samey. The drinks I thought where decent - beer and wine I thought where good especially the draft beer rather than the bottled but still ok.  Cocktails where all fine but depends who made the drink and how much alcohol or other mixers was put in.  Put it this way myself my wife and another couple knew we had been drinking all day on all of the days so it can‚Äôt be that bad! It‚Äôs certainly not watered down.  We got the shuttle bus into Medina which is free and booked the day before..a really good eye opening experience. We had a few drinks in rooftop bars etc all fine. But be prepared to be hassled quite a lot but a polite no thank you is fine.    But overall we enjoyed our stay at the hotel..rooms nice clean and modern English film channels to fall asleep to..  Staff where all quite nice and I suppose could have been a bit more chatty but maybe that‚Äôs just the way they are.  We joined in with some activities with the animation team and had a good laugh doing so.    We would recommend this hotel - maybe the sports bar could open earlier on a Saturday when the footballs on?  Although they did allow us to watch the tv‚Äôs but the bar wasn‚Äôt open until 17.00.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Stephanie C wrote a review Oct 2022,50,Amazing,Beds were really comfortable with soft nice pillows ( I am a complete pillow snob!) Bedding was soft and clean.  Great black out blinds with aircon that was quiet.  Bathroom is a nice size clean well tiled and free from mould! Nice shower pressure whilst I didn't use the bath it looked good.    We were a bit of a walk away from the relax pool ( our room was outside the sports bar) it was well worth It as it was very quiet in the evening.    There are 2 pools. Both great in their own right. One has activities and music all day. The other is quiet and has a swim up bar.    We had a great spa the hot stone massage was great and the gym has all you need.    Food is good fresh and varied with opertinity for buffet pool restaurant and ala cart. All very good. Service at the pool restaurant is a bit slow also very hit and miss with remembering things. (I had to ask for butter 3 times) but it really wasn't a big deal just something to keep in mind.    Alcoholic drinks are weaker during the day and by looking at the state of some people I understand why!!    Feedback for improvement would be:    The stalls at the swim bus bar and textured enought to exfoliate your cheeks and ruin you bikini so take care.    Second is waste and recycling!!!  Small bottles of water single use plastic cups and straws coming out your ears.    Would love to see them give you a drinks bottle and a facility to re fill it. The same with pool side drinks no straws and reusable plastic cups would be ideal!!.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephaniecS6727VZ
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,guru_fordy17 wrote a review Oct 2022,40,"A good hotel for a hassle free holiday, but there are some meh bits",Got off to a bad start with flights so we ended up arriving at midnight for check-in. Good first impressions of the hotel and the staff were very accommodating. Got to our rooms (bottom floor) and quickly noticed how tired everything was especially in the bathroom. Cracked tiles pubic hair dirty grout and worst of all was the drain smell that singed your nostrils. So late at night we just needed sleep so in the morning we asked to be moved and there was no fuss made. Second room was on the first floor and was much better so all good. That being said the shower head could have done with unblocking at least half the rubber outlets!    From there everything was hassle free. Never had to complain or say anything to the staff.    So a few quick fire points:  + Stork Beer was nice and on tap!  + Try the chilli peppers in the buffet delicious and hot.  + The a-la-carte restaurant was pretty nice with good food and entertainment.  + Internet was ok measure 80D/90U on a speed test. WiFi held ok.  + East facing rooms were very quiet in the evening. Even facing the road there was nothing going down it.  - Cocktails had less than a shot added so make sure you ask for a double.  - Buffet was nice but a bit boring/safe on flavors. We're in a land of spice and some of it just tasted of nothing. They have a spicy sauce which literally had no spiciness to it. You could see the same sauces in different dishes and very little variety over the week we stayed.  - Coffee from the buffet tasted like Nescafe. Go across to the lobby bar for a proper ground coffee.  - Waiting staff very slow to greet and offer drinks.  - No bathrobe or slipper provided  - The view from the room was a bit poor. We overlooked a wasteland area with wheelie bins in. Good job we didn't use the balcony much.    Useful info:  Shuttle bus to Marrakech centre was good. Dropoff is 8C3JJ2G4+2R (put in Google Maps search). You have to book this the day before to get a ticket.  The buffet gets really busy after 9am and ran out of cutlery and crockery so get there before.  The a-la-carte restaurant doesn't switch it's AC on till after it opens so don't book for when it opens like we did it was like an inferno!  The a-la-carte restaurant doesn't have a dress code    Would we go back to this hotel again...maybe but I would look around first for something a bit more luxury. We hold Cancun All-Inclusive as the standard and this was not even close to that.,Date of stay: September 2022,,"Shrewsbury, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/guru_fordy17
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Emmaphilp1 wrote a review Oct 2022,50,Already planning my next visit,Just returned from Be Live Marrakech Adults Only Hotel and i am already planning when I can return - next time likely as a solo traveller as I felt so safe within the hotel complex.  ALL the staff were beyond helpful and so hardworking - really wish I could remember everyones names. The maintainence/domestic/gardeners are literally working ALL the time keeping the complex absolutly spotless. The bar/reception/restaurant staff were so attentive and friendly - clearly worked off their feet though.  Salah at reception couldnt have been more friendly or helpful Adzine in the Lobby Bar - thank you for keeping our wine glasses topped up Sara in the bar - beautiful smile and so helpful Ema from entertainment team - thank you for the game of dominoes in the Sports Bar.    I know this hotel is advertised as 5star and as wonderful as it is I wouldnt quite say it was 5star.    Food in the buffet restaurant is plentiful and the chefs are fantastic. Local flavours large choices of meats fish shellfish salads veg breads fruits desserts juices etc. Small selection of ‚Äòbritish food‚Äô to keep the fussier eaters happy - plus the snack bar caters for those wanting pizza burgers etc.    The wines are local Morrocan wine - very nice!  Spirits and beers are also local and not premium but good choice of cocktails.    I visited the gym on an overcast day which was small but fairly well equipped.  My friend visited the spa (not included in the price) and had an amazing experience.    Cant wait to return to this hotel and to Morroco.  Thank you to all the Be Live Hotel staff who made our holiday one to remember.,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Emmaphilp1

The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Both pools were very clean and the overall quality of the food was good.    We stayed in a Superior Room with a garden view. The room was very comfortable and we had no issues to report.    The live music every evening before dinner really enhanced the experience and we didn‚Äôt struggle to get spots at either pool at any time of day (though the quiet pool with the swim up bar did fill up faster).    We saw a few otherwise very positive reviews before we came which said they didn‚Äôt consider this a five star hotel. I think this comes down to the size of the hotel resort itself. It‚Äôs quite a small place relative to similar resort type locations I‚Äôve visited in the past. However I think the smaller size also has its positives as the atmosphere of an evening around the smaller entertainment area was always really upbeat and fun.    One small improvement would be opening the sports bar earlier. This really was a hidden gem with a good pool table table football and board games (as well as a nice bar) it was a shame it didn‚Äôt open until 5 pm.    The quality and variety of food (especially the pizza and made to order pasta station) was better than expected based on some reviews we read.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,At0micandy wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Great for a break away from it all,Arrival and booking in was great and the room welcoming. Large comfortable double bed with table and chair room safe tea and coffee making. Mini Bar is empty but useful for storing and cooling water and drinks. We had a swim up room which we thought poor and when we return we will not go for again. It is more of a paddle up and they insist on putting the sun loungers in the water - not good if you like to browse electronic items! For what the upgrade cost the swim up is poor. The buffet restaurant took a bit of getting used to - the food is plentiful and varied but different from usual UK tastes. The usuals bread rolls pastries omelettes etc plenty of fruits but I did struggle to find a selection of cheeses. The A La Carte restaurant was really not to our taste everything tasted of apricots or almonds we shall not revisist when we go back. 2 swimming pools one busy and noisy and the other quiet - both had plenty of sunbeds and parasols. The Quieter pool also had several cabanas which were great to respite from the hot sun. However the cushions in the cabanas were all tired and desperately need replacing. In the week we were there we managed to get a pair of sunbeds or a cabana whenever we wanted no need to do the 6 AM towel run. Drinks from the various bars were OK but tended to be weak. I did struggle getting a coffee to my taste I suspect it was their choice of bean. Staff were pretty much all great and warm and friendly no complaints there at all. We stayed in the hotel all week so cannot comment on local amenities the hotel had everything we wanted we booked late check out and that was absolutely perfect for our flight times. We shall book again next year a great hotel with no children screaming and a quiet pool. Perfect for us to relax.,Date of stay: September 2022,,"Gloucestershire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/At0micandy

The rooms are clean and spacious the food tasty and plentiful with ac good range of local dishes fish salads and pasta and pizza etc in the restaurant and snacks and sandwiches at the pool bar. Both pools are lovely with one much quieter than the other space to sunbathe and a swim up bar. The spa is large and well run with an indoor pool. Being all inclusive and childfree made it a very relaxing place to stay. Every single member of the staff we met was friendly and kind.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Martin H wrote a review Sep 2022,40,Fantastic Stay,Myself and my partner spent 7 nights at Be Live Collection. We arrived at the hotel around 10pm which by then the main dining area had closed. The room was fantastic clean spacious and the bed was absolutely comfortable and big which I loved as I like to toss and turn thoughout the night. There is a window in-between the bathroom and the bedroom which allows you to see the person showering however there is a mesh blind however you can still see depending on light. This is not a problem if you are with your partner but if you are sharing with mates your not comfortable seeing you have a bath/shower just bear this in mind.    There are two pools the quiet pool which also has the swim up bar we never visited and spent most of our time at the main pool. The main pool does host various water games to keep you entertained. I got involved in one or two which I fully enjoyed. The water sports and pool side games were hosted by Emma and Titif who were amazing and a big credit to the hotel. From day one I was approached at pool side by Oussama who went out of his way and provided me with a parasol everyday and made sure I had sunshade while my partner had the sun. Well done and thank you.    The food I found overall ok and found food I like.However my partner had an upset stomach after day two and didn't like hardly any of the food.    Outside the hotel there is no amenities however the hotel does run a free bus into the local town were you will find restaurants shops and the market. If you are going to the market just be sure to keep your belongs safe and not to carry and valuables goods such as jewellery and be prepared to be harassed by the locals as they can be quite intense. The bus to the town you do need to book in advance .    Overall the hotel is very clean and there are cleaners always cleaning a=so they take pride in the hotel. I would definitely visit this hotel again.,Date of stay: September 2022,,"Greater London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/914martinh

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Kaz wrote a review Sep 2022,50,"Fabulous, fabulous!!",Well what can I say the title says it all but anyway here‚Äôs my full review lol!    To begin with the staff were always happy and available whenever you needed them nothing seemed to be much trouble.    We had a swim up room which was amazing I would definitely recommend choosing one of these rooms. Always lovely and clean maids were great. Pity there just wasn‚Äôt a few more English channels on the tv but always a film channel which was good my hubby missed the sports channel though!    Food was great lunchtime and evening. I noticed a few negative reviews about the food but there was always something you could find to eat. Yes there was a selection of daily tagines but you are in Morocco? They had a different meat which was carved each evening the lamb especially was fantastic. Lots of various pastas. The French stick breads were lovely and just like ours at home. Different soup each evening and my husband had the chicken soup and said it was amazing the best chicken soup he‚Äôd ever tasted and he‚Äôs fussy when it comes to his soups!! Lovely seafood calamari large prawns mussels in various sauces. The chefs and staff work so hard to please. The only slight downside was they never seemed to be any fries? I know we all love fries so that might be something they need to look into. But again staff couldn‚Äôt do enough for you. So yes the seating area was a little annoying poor serving staff rushed off their feet but tried to lay the tables and serve you as quickly as they could. Breakfast was also good omelettes made to order the general breakfast items wasn‚Äôt keen on the chorizo breakfast sausage and no bacon but everything else good. Dried fruit fresh fruit daily pastries cheeses hams and more enough choice for most people I‚Äôm sure. Well you certainly won‚Äôt go hungry. I would only say it‚Äôs a pity there isn‚Äôt a little snack place open late evening. Restaurant closes at 10.00 but entertainment finishes are 12.00 and I always need a little snack before I go to bed but that‚Äôs just me lol! Tbh I used to take a few biscuits and cakes to have later.    Evening entertainment was well as it can a in most countries bit hit and miss. The two male singers each evening were very good Brazilian dancers were worth watching not keen on the group that where there on a couple of occasions. DJ was great and karaoke was a a laugh and if you didn‚Äôt want to join in you could laugh at everyone else! Again very busy and lack of tables but staff always found you at been and chairs. Again I must say Azine was a fabulous waiter rushed off his feet but always remembers what we were having to drink and everyone else‚Äôs he worked his socks off so to speak always supplying drinks to people as quickly as he could he did a great job well done Azdine!    The food at the snack bar was nice but the buns and bread served there was so sweet too sweet for us so I just used to order some of the French stick bread. Hey but this was the only place you could get French fries! Again sometimes you had to was a little while for your food/ drinks but you can see they are so busy but always happy and pleasant. Shout out goes to I think Hamzi‚Äôs great guys!    Last but not least the Animation Team fabulous guys if you wanted to join in with the activities you could but no problem if you didn‚Äôt they definitely weren‚Äôt in your face so to speak. Daily activities of archery darts water aerobics water polo and lots of games. The staff were amazing especially Titif what a lovely kind helpful young man you are a truly great asset to the hotel continuously working hard day and night missing you already! Now Emma another fabulous member of the animation team lovely helpful young lady.    My hubby loves a massage whilst on holiday so opted for the 3 day sessions. He said they were all great but the hot stones were amazing the best massage he‚Äôs had by far. Not quite sure of the young ladies name that did the stone massage but good value for money.    Free coach to the centre of Marrakesh 3 times day. We went with friends we met at the hotel one being for a drink and meal. Similar to a lot of countries lots of people trying to sell you items you don‚Äôt want so just politely say no the thanks.    We didn‚Äôt go on any trips so can‚Äôt comment about those as we just wanted a relaxing holiday but lots of people that went on various trips seemed to enjoy them.    Well I think that‚Äôs about it happy holidays!!!,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"West Wickham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alfies

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Lauren D wrote a review Sep 2022,40,9 night stay - September,We have just returned from a 9 night stay at Be Live. We have had a lovely time at this beautiful hotel however would recommend considering 9 nights due to the certain negatives which we encountered.    Hotel: The hotel itself is very modern and beautiful. The rooms are very spacious and provide a lovely touch to the hotel. Our toiletries were not topped up regularly (shampoos etc) however we took our own at the beginning so this wasn‚Äôt a big problem! The television only has x2 English Channels (but we weren‚Äôt bothered because we don‚Äôt really watch the television much). The room is cleaned daily and the maids always done a perfect job- I often asked for coffee creams to be added to the mini bar which they done immediately! The air con In the room worked a treat and the beds are very comfy!    The hotel is always very clean and there is always staff about cleaning and maintaining the gardens there is a lot of space which could be used for other things which is abandoned though. For instance on floor 1 there is a very big spacious area with x2 outside balconies which would make a perfect bar / cocktail sitting area - however no one sits there and everyone tries to get seated in the bar downstairs near the live music.    Food: The food itself is delicious and they do provide a wide range of foods! Breakfasts include eggs pastries fruits cheeses and Hams omelettes and pancakes. However a lot of the food is always the same and sometimes cold. For example you can guarantee that there will be couscous beef tagine rice or Turkey on the menu on an evening. The desserts aren‚Äôt that good - they are quite small and they are pretty much all the same- but they are tasty! The food itself is lovely and the waiters in the dining area are a credit to the hotel. The food does cater for a wide variety such as: mussels lamb beef Turkey dishes pasta dishes vegetables rice couscous etc‚Ä¶.    A big negative about the food / dining area is how small it is. As the hotel gets quite busy the food area to plate and collect your food is extremely small and this often leads to queuing for your food and feeling on top of one another.    Cocktails: One thing we really enjoyed about this hotel was the amazing selection of drinks and cocktails! The cocktails are beautiful and there is a lot on tne menu to choose from including: tequila sunrise fun on the beach pina coladas Malibu and coke mojito strawberry mojito etc! We spent most of our time at the quiet pool and have to give a MASSIVE credit to the bar men at the swim up pool bar! There was mainly only one gent on there the full day and he was none stop all day making sure you were served straight away. Nothing was a bother to him!    Staff: The staff at the hotel are lovely and will do anything for you. They are definitely under staffed and especially on a night time downstairs near the live music ! Azdine is the only waiter and is an absolute credit to the hotel- he was very humorous and got on with everyone taking everyone‚Äôs order and running round all night. No fault of Azdine as he possibly couldn‚Äôt do anymore he is that busy and doing an incredible job however the hotel would massively benefit from more staff on an evening.    Spa: Unfortunately we didn‚Äôt get the chance to book the spa which was one of the main reasons we booked this hotel. The spa costs ‚Ç¨15.00 each per hour even just to use the indoor pool.    Check in wasn‚Äôt until 3pm- which when we arrived at 12:30pm wasn‚Äôt great - however the staff had the room ready for us early as we had asked and it was ready for 1:30pm. You do have to pay a deposit and tax when you arrive - however this is refunded at the end of your visit.    The entertainment is good and the singers are great. Unfortunately as you can‚Äôt really leave the resort on an evening the evening entertainment is always the same (live music) so we would often get a couple of drinks and take them back to our room because it was always the same.    Overall we have had a lovely holiday and a 9 night stay at the hotel - I would definitely return to this hotel.    Thanks to all of the staff for such a lovely stay and all of your hard work l.,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Durham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Laurrendixon978

The rooms are a good size. Were kept waiting for our rooms though. Now being all inclusive the food is ok. It was repetitive on most nights. Lunch at the snack bar was much better than the buffet. Now the biggest problem is the alcoholic drinks. They are so watered down you could not get drunk even if you tried. I know the point is not to get drunk but seriously. Disappointed. Bar staff were great. The pools were great. Pool bar bars not so great. Giving us drinks that wasps had sat on. Not good. The entertainment team were absolutely fantastic. If it was not for them we would of had such a boring holiday. The free bus to the medina was good. Maybe being someone who has been to many great all inclusive hotel my expectations were of a higher standard.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Cloger365 wrote a review Jun 2022,30,"5 star accommodation, 1 star food",My partner and I stayed at Be Live Collection for a week on 14th June. On arrival to the hotel we were greeted with Moroccan mint tea and snacks. The staff were very friendly and the check in process very easy. You will have to pay a tourist tax on arrival and a deposit for the room however this is refunded on departure.    We had a road view room which was very spacious. The king size bed was changed each morning and was very comfortable. The shower worked however there was an issue with the altering attachement which meant it shot at the wall the full time. The rainfall shower did not work and looked as if it was for decorative purposes only. Each morning the towels were changed.    The pool areas were immaculate. The larger pool was our preference as there was music on and a good atmosphere. The entertainment team were fabulous and really worked hard to get people involved...however did not pressure you into activities either. The Yoga was great as was aqua aerobics and darts. The cleaning staff regularly cleared away cups and swept away water from the side of the pool which could be slippy.  The smaller pool was lovely to relax later in the day. The swim up bar did often have a bit of a wait as only 1 person was serving. The glass bottle beers were a hit for us! At times the cocktails did need more alcohol but staff were more than happy to add more. The cocktail menu had a number of options and all were very tasty - strawberry mojito was my favourite!    The nighttime entertainment particularly the singers were brilliant. It was chilled and easy going with nothing too ‚Äúin your face‚Äù. There was plenty of space to relax at night and the outside space was lovely. We weren‚Äôt ever bothered by mosquitoes which was a hit but there was numerous cats running around which really put me off. It did not help that guests would feed them or pet them.    The gym was small but had excellent range of equipment for a few workouts over the duration of the holiday. The fresh towels and cold water were a great addition. It was never too busy which helped.    Moving onto the food. The pool bar provided bar snacks throughout the day including pizza toasties burger and chips. This menu catered to all and everything was fresh and tasted great. The breakfast buffet had a lot to offer. The pancakes were a huge hit as well as the freshly made omelettes and fresh fruit and yoghurt. However the evening buffet was a huge disappointment. There were bizarre combinations of flavours limited choice and on one occasion we had chicken nuggets (baring in mind it‚Äôs adults only) as there was limited options available. For dessert I would recommend the small fruit pastry tarts - delicious! My partner did experience an upset stomach after eating the cold prawns which did impact on the holiday. At nighttime the cats are always prowling around the outdoor area of the buffet so be aware. We did attend the Moroccan restaurant one night but again the food was similar to that offered in the buffet but presented in a slightly nicer manner. The cous cous was very dry and the chicken dish was very olivey.    The hotel offers a shuttle bus to-from the city on a 2 hourly basis. It is a easy way to get in and out. Dropped off at the Jeema-El Fna and easy to get a taxi to other areas of the city.    All the staff at the hotel were attentive and very friendly and helpful. I cannot fault them at all!    Overall the stay was good however improvements on the food are needed to make it a true 5* hotel.,Date of stay: June 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"West Lothian, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cloger365
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Chrissylew22 wrote a review Jun 2022,10,Great hotel in a convenient setting and good facilities but trust nobody - our money was stolen!,The facilities and hotel were fantastic and we would recommend the guided trip to Marrakesh markets booked through the tour company in the hotel lobby as they were friendly and helpful and very informative. The YSL gardens are fab and if you go with a guide you jump the queue. You also get little to no hassle in the markets and if you don't want to to barter they will do it for you. The main pool has loads of activities to get involved in. The drinks are good and the food is what you would expect from this sort of holiday. Rooms are clean and modern looking. Buffet restaurant staff could be more attentive with drinks etc but they are friendly when they are. The reception staff were fine on arrival however we were not happy with the experience with them at the end of the holiday. Myself and my partners money was taken from our room during our stay there when we went to pay for the tour at the end of the holiday I opened my wallet to find that both the Morrocan dirhams and the British pounds were gone. Realising this was the case we went back to the room only to discover that my partners purse was also empty. Long story short they didn't believe us because they have never had anything stolen before the receptionist eventually apologies and said they would investigate with the manager and come back to us but never did. Put a sour taste in our mouths and made it a very expensive holiday and not one I would recommend unless they sort it. The money was stolen from a zipped bag under a dressing table in a locked room (yes it ideally should have been in the safe but you just don't expect that when on a 5 star holiday you have to carry round every single valuable item all of the time to make sure its safe).,Date of stay: June 2022,,"Derbyshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chrissylew22
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Taryn M wrote a review Jun 2022,50,Stunning Hotel!,This was one of the nicest (definitely cleanest) hotels I have ever been to!    Pros:  - The grounds are so much prettier than the pictures  - Constant cleaning in progress  - The staff can‚Äôt do enough for you  - The hotel is stunning and new  - The pools - ones for activities and partying and the other is perfect for just chilling so you have a choice  - There are always loungers available (no early morning lounge hoggers)  - Entertainment switches off at bang on 12am for those of you that don‚Äôt want to pull an all nighter  - The food consists of a mix of English French and Moroccan - so a good selection  - The restaurant and bar staff actually all the staff (reception and bellboys) are so super friendly and helpful  - Room was lovely and big  - Bathroom was huge    Cons:  - Our shower (room 5002) leaked and flooded the whole bathroom everytime we showered - staff cleared it up no problem though  - The pool barman was a little grouchy - but probably with reason as he worked the whole day without backup (which probably wouldn‚Äôt even be legal in this country (UK))  - We chose and paid for a pool view room - which was lovely but one the couple of occasions we wanted to go to bed before 12am we were disturbed by the entertainment that goes on until 12am. I would suggest anyone that wants early nights shouldn‚Äôt worry about a pool view room    All in all we plan on returning next year and staying longer.    Thank you to all the staff at Be Live!!

The hotel room was perfect the hotel has a lovely feel and the staff were so helpful - nothing was too much trouble. The pools are lovely and the food and drink for all inclusive were great lots of variety and fresh food. Cocktails were freely available and the pool bar is also great for food and snacks. We took advantage of the offer for one night in the a la crate restaurant but actually would say that the buffet restaurant was of even better quality!

Its a reasonable size hotel with 2 pools one to chill and one with activities such as aquagym and water polo.  Salim is in charge of the activities including the evening events. They vary from karaoke to live band and the atmosphere is a good mix between party and lounge.  Being an all inclusive hotel the guys behind the bar are crucial!  Ahmed and Oussama are the perfect answer already preparing the cocktail once they see you approching the bar.  In case you prefer to sit down at the terrace just look for Azdine he is the smiling man runing around with cocktails and always ready to bring you drinks.  I wouldn't want to forget Tarek manager of the main bar and making sure that everyone is staying hydrated.

My only moan is that we were in room 4004 and the music at night was very very loud. During the hot evenings when there wasn‚Äôt rain forecast they would bring the eve enterntainment outside. If went off at midnight but until then it‚Äôs very unpleasant. We asked reception for earplugs as apart from the noise we loved our room. Unfortunately they didn‚Äôt have any however did offer to move us. As we were going the following day we declined.  Take earplugs or just drink lots of gin then you‚Äôre be fine.,Date of stay: June 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N6451HXelaineb
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,tchouki123 wrote a review Jun 2022,50,Great Staff,I stayed at beLive for a week and I have to say that the staff is amazing.  Its a reasonable size hotel with 2 pools one to chill and one with activities such as aquagym and water polo.  Salim is in charge of the activities including the evening events. They vary from karaoke to live band and the atmosphere is a good mix between party and lounge.  Being an all inclusive hotel the guys behind the bar are crucial!  Ahmed and Oussama are the perfect answer already preparing the cocktail once they see you approching the bar.  In case you prefer to sit down at the terrace just look for Azdine he is the smiling man runing around with cocktails and always ready to bring you drinks.  I wouldn't want to forget Tarek manager of the main bar and making sure that everyone is staying hydrated.  In conclusion its a nice hotel with great staff.,Date of stay: June 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tchouki123

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,mcuk23 wrote a review Jun 2022,40,"Above Average, but not 5 stars",We stayed for 10 days in May our first proper holiday for 2 years after covid. We had a really relaxing and enjoyable break and Overall this hotel is great but it needs some work to get to a 5-star level. Here's my breakdown.    Cleanliness - 5/5 - This is a very clean hotel there's always someone buzzing around sweeping clipping the hedges mopping the floors etc. The rooms were cleaned bedding changed and floors mopped daily. The main reception is very clean and has a lovely diffuser smell to it too. The food areas are always being cleaned by the staff.    Food - 4/5 - Plenty of choices good selection of hot and cold food egg station in the mornings pasta station at night. They changed the menu slightly every day but sometimes dinner felt like you were just eating a reheated rehashed version of whatever was out at lunchtime. They don't serve fast food here other than pizza so no fries nuggets burgers etc The restaurant seemed a little small too and can imagine at full capacity it would be really cramped.    The snack bar is a real letdown the food is really not well presented or thought through. I had a pizza with literally 3 strands of cheese on it. Dry panini with wilted brown salad Cesar salad consists of some lettuce anchovies and 2 chicken nuggets drizzled with mayo. You get a basket of fries with around 10 fries in It's really not 5-star quality at all.    The 1 A la carte restaurant is Moroccan we are both not fans of sweet food which typically Moroccan food is but this was nice. only a choice of Menu A or B but we tried both and they were OK nothing to shout about. The Hotel really could do with another food offering.    Pool areas - 4/5 There are 2 pools one is near the snack bar which we didn't stay at as it was constantly pumping music and loud people everywhere. Felt like a club 18-30 vibe with people drinking way too much and being generally loud. The other pool is much nicer quiet and relaxing however we found people bagging sunbeds early ( which is not uncommon anywhere ) but the annoying thing was people reserving the day beds and then taking 2 sun loungers too. This made a few days a little tricky to get a sun lounger after 9.30 am but we managed all the same. The chap Kamal in the pool bar is great. Run off his feet all day no breaks and always a friendly hello. We tipped him a few dirhams here and there and found that we were never really waiting long for a beer.    Drinks 3/5 - Stork beer ( which is nice ) but tiny little glass bottles gone in 3/4 swigs. The cocktails are literally made up as they go along it seems. We heard several people complain about the lack of alcohol in the drinks but we never experienced this ourselves. The wine is nice and cold dry like pinot grigio style but again you would expect a 5-star resort to have a little choice however there is literally red/white/rose wine and that's it.    Room - 4/5 - Clean and bright our first room was overlooking the car park/road area to the rear of the hotel and we only stayed 1 night. We went to reception to enquire about a swim-up room ( i had emailed ahead and asked and was quoted 700 euro for 10 nights ). At the reception we asked and got a swim-up for 9 nights for around 400 euro. so much less than originally quoted. HOWEVER - I wouldn't bother doing this it really is literally a small cold slither of pool right outside your doors no privacy and ours was next to the walkway so had people constantly walking by. I wouldn't choose this option again but would have changed to a pool facing upper floor room instead.    Overall it's a decent place to stay to get away from the UK for a while. It's Hot and only 3.5 hrs flight from home. The Moroccan people in general are very warm welcoming and friendly. The staff in this hotel are very friendly Azdine in the lobby bar was probably one of the best barmen I've ever come across his friendliness charm and hard-working attitude are great to see. Most of the other staff were great too. There was the occasional grumpy face in the main buffet restaurant but I guess we caught a few of them on an off day. We tipped 20/50 dirham every now and again for good service and we were never really without a table or a drink too.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Isabel D wrote a review May 2022,30,First All Inclusive Experience,Very good first hotel all inclusive experience with staff all being extremely friendly and attentive. Activities were offered throughout the day and food and drinks were served whenever you pleased. Bedroom was very comfy and cleaned regularly throughout the day and the hotel as a whole was spotless. However although the food offered was pleasing and extremely reasonable for the price we paid to stay myself and my brother suffered with upset stomachs from most of the trip and one of the nights i actually vomited. This may not have been linked to the food served but considering the milk often smelt like cheese i think it was extremely likely. Apart from that slight drawback the experience at belive was thrilling and has a high chance of being revisited.,Date of stay: May 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/isxbeldorey
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Jon H wrote a review May 2022,50,Lovely Hotel,We had two swim up rooms for 4 nights last week. From the minute we arrived the service was fantastic. During our whole stay the staff were efficient and always had a smile on their faces. The room was brilliant with a comfortable bed and a lovely bathroom. We really loved our outside area with our own terrace and pool. The hotel facilities were great and we loved the pool area and using the swim up bar. Drinks were available all day with good bottled beer and wine but the cocktails were very weak with hardly any alcohol in them. The buffet was excellent and we enjoyed the breakfast  lunch and dinner there. We also enjoyed our meal in the Moroccan Restaurant where again the service was excellent. Overall the food was great but the quality of the drinks could have been better. Whilst we were there we had a birthday and the staff came over with a cake and sang happy birthday. The only facility that was disappointing was the sports bar. We were hoping to watch the F1 and football on the Sunday but it didn't open until 5pm. It's not really a sports bar more of a games bar with pool table and table football. Overall we had a great break in a lovely hotel with very good service.,Date of stay: May 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Athens, Greece",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/693jonh

The whole time we have been here the Staff have been wonderful efficient and friendly! In particular we would love to mention the warmth of Tariq the f and b Manager who is a credit to the hotel.    Upon arrival we were early for check in so taken straight to the lovely pool bar for cocktails and lunch we knew immediately that we were going to be looked after.    The food quality in both the main buffet restaurant pool bar and alacarte restaurant has been of a particularly high standard as-well as a wide selection of wines cocktails and soft drinks to choose from throughout the day.    There are a number of activities to choose from if you want ranging from yoga to archery spin classes and Pilates. We enjoy sunbathing around the pool and enjoying a good book but it‚Äôs nice to try something new.    The rooms are all brand new with flat screen TVs drench showers and are really comfortable. We just opted for a standard room and loved it but you can opt to stay in a suite or in a room that has a swim up moat to your own private sun beds on your terrace.    There is entertainment every night we have seen belly dancers singers and salsa classes when we have been in but we have also enjoyed making use of the free shuttle that takes you into Marrakesh and picks you up again. This has allowed use to explore and enjoy the city in the mornings and at night.

Drinks 3/5 - Stork beer ( which is nice ) but tiny little glass bottles gone in 3/4 swigs. The cocktails are literally made up as they go along it seems. We heard several people complain about the lack of alcohol in the drinks but we never experienced this ourselves. The wine is nice and cold dry like pinot grigio style but again you would expect a 5-star resort to have a little choice however there is literally red/white/rose wine and that's it.    Room - 4/5 - Clean and bright our first room was overlooking the car park/road area to the rear of the hotel and we only stayed 1 night. We went to reception to enquire about a swim-up room ( i had emailed ahead and asked and was quoted 700 euro for 10 nights ). At the reception we asked and got a swim-up for 9 nights for around 400 euro. so much less than originally quoted. HOWEVER - I wouldn't bother doing this it really is literally a small cold slither of pool right outside your doors no privacy and ours was next to the walkway so had people constantly walking by. I wouldn't choose this option again but would have changed to a pool facing upper floor room instead.    Overall it's a decent place to stay to get away from the UK for a while. It's Hot and only 3.5 hrs flight from home. The Moroccan people in general are very warm welcoming and friendly. The staff in this hotel are very friendly Azdine in the lobby bar was probably one of the best barmen I've ever come across his friendliness charm and hard-working attitude are great to see. Most of the other staff were great too. There was the occasional grumpy face in the main buffet restaurant but I guess we caught a few of them on an off day. We tipped 20/50 dirham every now and again for good service and we were never really without a table or a drink too.

Activities were offered throughout the day and food and drinks were served whenever you pleased. Bedroom was very comfy and cleaned regularly throughout the day and the hotel as a whole was spotless. However although the food offered was pleasing and extremely reasonable for the price we paid to stay myself and my brother suffered with upset stomachs from most of the trip and one of the nights i actually vomited. This may not have been linked to the food served but considering the milk often smelt like cheese i think it was extremely likely.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Jon H wrote a review May 2022,50,Lovely Hotel,We had two swim up rooms for 4 nights last week. From the minute we arrived the service was fantastic. During our whole stay the staff were efficient and always had a smile on their faces. The room was brilliant with a comfortable bed and a lovely bathroom. We really loved our outside area with our own terrace and pool. The hotel facilities were great and we loved the pool area and using the swim up bar. Drinks were available all day with good bottled beer and wine but the cocktails were very weak with hardly any alcohol in them. The buffet was excellent and we enjoyed the breakfast  lunch and dinner there. We also enjoyed our meal in the Moroccan Restaurant where again the service was excellent. Overall the food was great but the quality of the drinks could have been better. Whilst we were there we had a birthday and the staff came over with a cake and sang happy birthday. The only facility that was disappointing was the sports bar. We were hoping to watch the F1 and football on the Sunday but it didn't open until 5pm. It's not really a sports bar more of a games bar with pool table and table football.

The whole time we have been here the Staff have been wonderful efficient and friendly! In particular we would love to mention the warmth of Tariq the f and b Manager who is a credit to the hotel.    Upon arrival we were early for check in so taken straight to the lovely pool bar for cocktails and lunch we knew immediately that we were going to be looked after.    The food quality in both the main buffet restaurant pool bar and alacarte restaurant has been of a particularly high standard as-well as a wide selection of wines cocktails and soft drinks to choose from throughout the day.    There are a number of activities to choose from if you want ranging from yoga to archery spin classes and Pilates. We enjoy sunbathing around the pool and enjoying a good book but it‚Äôs nice to try something new.    The rooms are all brand new with flat screen TVs drench showers and are really comfortable. We just opted for a standard room and loved it but you can opt to stay in a suite or in a room that has a swim up moat to your own private sun beds on your terrace.    There is entertainment every night we have seen belly dancers singers and salsa classes when we have been in but we have also enjoyed making use of the free shuttle that takes you into Marrakesh and picks you up again. This has allowed use to explore and enjoy the city in the mornings and at night.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,mcuk23 wrote a review Jun 2022,40,"Above Average, but not 5 stars",We stayed for 10 days in May our first proper holiday for 2 years after covid. We had a really relaxing and enjoyable break and Overall this hotel is great but it needs some work to get to a 5-star level. Here's my breakdown.    Cleanliness - 5/5 - This is a very clean hotel there's always someone buzzing around sweeping clipping the hedges mopping the floors etc. The rooms were cleaned bedding changed and floors mopped daily. The main reception is very clean and has a lovely diffuser smell to it too. The food areas are always being cleaned by the staff.    Food - 4/5 - Plenty of choices good selection of hot and cold food egg station in the mornings pasta station at night. They changed the menu slightly every day but sometimes dinner felt like you were just eating a reheated rehashed version of whatever was out at lunchtime. They don't serve fast food here other than pizza so no fries nuggets burgers etc The restaurant seemed a little small too and can imagine at full capacity it would be really cramped.    The snack bar is a real letdown the food is really not well presented or thought through. I had a pizza with literally 3 strands of cheese on it. Dry panini with wilted brown salad Cesar salad consists of some lettuce anchovies and 2 chicken nuggets drizzled with mayo. You get a basket of fries with around 10 fries in It's really not 5-star quality at all.    The 1 A la carte restaurant is Moroccan we are both not fans of sweet food which typically Moroccan food is but this was nice. only a choice of Menu A or B but we tried both and they were OK nothing to shout about. The Hotel really could do with another food offering.    Pool areas - 4/5 There are 2 pools one is near the snack bar which we didn't stay at as it was constantly pumping music and loud people everywhere. Felt like a club 18-30 vibe with people drinking way too much and being generally loud. The other pool is much nicer quiet and relaxing however we found people bagging sunbeds early ( which is not uncommon anywhere ) but the annoying thing was people reserving the day beds and then taking 2 sun loungers too. This made a few days a little tricky to get a sun lounger after 9.30 am but we managed all the same. The chap Kamal in the pool bar is great. Run off his feet all day no breaks and always a friendly hello. We tipped him a few dirhams here and there and found that we were never really waiting long for a beer.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,mcuk23 wrote a review Jun 2022,40,"Above Average, but not 5 stars",We stayed for 10 days in May our first proper holiday for 2 years after covid. We had a really relaxing and enjoyable break and Overall this hotel is great but it needs some work to get to a 5-star level. Here's my breakdown.    Cleanliness - 5/5 - This is a very clean hotel there's always someone buzzing around sweeping clipping the hedges mopping the floors etc. The rooms were cleaned bedding changed and floors mopped daily. The main reception is very clean and has a lovely diffuser smell to it too. The food areas are always being cleaned by the staff.    Food - 4/5 - Plenty of choices good selection of hot and cold food egg station in the mornings pasta station at night. They changed the menu slightly every day but sometimes dinner felt like you were just eating a reheated rehashed version of whatever was out at lunchtime. They don't serve fast food here other than pizza so no fries nuggets burgers etc The restaurant seemed a little small too and can imagine at full capacity it would be really cramped.    The snack bar is a real letdown the food is really not well presented or thought through. I had a pizza with literally 3 strands of cheese on it. Dry panini with wilted brown salad Cesar salad consists of some lettuce anchovies and 2 chicken nuggets drizzled with mayo. You get a basket of fries with around 10 fries in It's really not 5-star quality at all.    The 1 A la carte restaurant is Moroccan we are both not fans of sweet food which typically Moroccan food is but this was nice. only a choice of Menu A or B but we tried both and they were OK nothing to shout about. The Hotel really could do with another food offering.    Pool areas - 4/5 There are 2 pools one is near the snack bar which we didn't stay at as it was constantly pumping music and loud people everywhere. Felt like a club 18-30 vibe with people drinking way too much and being generally loud. The other pool is much nicer quiet and relaxing however we found people bagging sunbeds early ( which is not uncommon anywhere ) but the annoying thing was people reserving the day beds and then taking 2 sun loungers too. This made a few days a little tricky to get a sun lounger after 9.30 am but we managed all the same. The chap Kamal in the pool bar is great. Run off his feet all day no breaks and always a friendly hello. We tipped him a few dirhams here and there and found that we were never really waiting long for a beer.    Drinks 3/5 - Stork beer ( which is nice ) but tiny little glass bottles gone in 3/4 swigs. The cocktails are literally made up as they go along it seems. We heard several people complain about the lack of alcohol in the drinks but we never experienced this ourselves. The wine is nice and cold dry like pinot grigio style but again you would expect a 5-star resort to have a little choice however there is literally red/white/rose wine and that's it.    Room - 4/5 - Clean and bright our first room was overlooking the car park/road area to the rear of the hotel and we only stayed 1 night. We went to reception to enquire about a swim-up room ( i had emailed ahead and asked and was quoted 700 euro for 10 nights ). At the reception we asked and got a swim-up for 9 nights for around 400 euro. so much less than originally quoted. HOWEVER - I wouldn't bother doing this it really is literally a small cold slither of pool right outside your doors no privacy and ours was next to the walkway so had people constantly walking by. I wouldn't choose this option again but would have changed to a pool facing upper floor room instead.    Overall it's a decent place to stay to get away from the UK for a while. It's Hot and only 3.5 hrs flight from home. The Moroccan people in general are very warm welcoming and friendly. The staff in this hotel are very friendly Azdine in the lobby bar was probably one of the best barmen I've ever come across his friendliness charm and hard-working attitude are great to see. Most of the other staff were great too. There was the occasional grumpy face in the main buffet restaurant but I guess we caught a few of them on an off day. We tipped 20/50 dirham every now and again for good service and we were never really without a table or a drink too.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Isabel D wrote a review May 2022,30,First All Inclusive Experience,Very good first hotel all inclusive experience with staff all being extremely friendly and attentive. Activities were offered throughout the day and food and drinks were served whenever you pleased. Bedroom was very comfy and cleaned regularly throughout the day and the hotel as a whole was spotless. However although the food offered was pleasing and extremely reasonable for the price we paid to stay myself and my brother suffered with upset stomachs from most of the trip and one of the nights i actually vomited. This may not have been linked to the food served but considering the milk often smelt like cheese i think it was extremely likely.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Jon H wrote a review May 2022,50,Lovely Hotel,We had two swim up rooms for 4 nights last week. From the minute we arrived the service was fantastic. During our whole stay the staff were efficient and always had a smile on their faces. The room was brilliant with a comfortable bed and a lovely bathroom. We really loved our outside area with our own terrace and pool. The hotel facilities were great and we loved the pool area and using the swim up bar. Drinks were available all day with good bottled beer and wine but the cocktails were very weak with hardly any alcohol in them. The buffet was excellent and we enjoyed the breakfast  lunch and dinner there. We also enjoyed our meal in the Moroccan Restaurant where again the service was excellent. Overall the food was great but the quality of the drinks could have been better. Whilst we were there we had a birthday and the staff came over with a cake and sang happy birthday. The only facility that was disappointing was the sports bar. We were hoping to watch the F1 and football on the Sunday but it didn't open until 5pm. It's not really a sports bar more of a games bar with pool table and table football. Overall we had a great break in a lovely hotel with very good service.,Date of stay: May 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Athens, Greece",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/693jonh

The whole time we have been here the Staff have been wonderful efficient and friendly! In particular we would love to mention the warmth of Tariq the f and b Manager who is a credit to the hotel.    Upon arrival we were early for check in so taken straight to the lovely pool bar for cocktails and lunch we knew immediately that we were going to be looked after.    The food quality in both the main buffet restaurant pool bar and alacarte restaurant has been of a particularly high standard as-well as a wide selection of wines cocktails and soft drinks to choose from throughout the day.    There are a number of activities to choose from if you want ranging from yoga to archery spin classes and Pilates. We enjoy sunbathing around the pool and enjoying a good book but it‚Äôs nice to try something new.    The rooms are all brand new with flat screen TVs drench showers and are really comfortable. We just opted for a standard room and loved it but you can opt to stay in a suite or in a room that has a swim up moat to your own private sun beds on your terrace.    There is entertainment every night we have seen belly dancers singers and salsa classes when we have been in but we have also enjoyed making use of the free shuttle that takes you into Marrakesh and picks you up again. This has allowed use to explore and enjoy the city in the mornings and at night.    Thank you to Be live Marrakesh and Tariq we have had an amazing holiday and will definitely be using the Be live collection again as we have seen you have them all over the world!,Date of stay: May 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Newcastle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Angel0ftheN0rth

The whole time we have been here the Staff have been wonderful efficient and friendly! In particular we would love to mention the warmth of Tariq the f and b Manager who is a credit to the hotel.    Upon arrival we were early for check in so taken straight to the lovely pool bar for cocktails and lunch we knew immediately that we were going to be looked after.    The food quality in both the main buffet restaurant pool bar and alacarte restaurant has been of a particularly high standard as-well as a wide selection of wines cocktails and soft drinks to choose from throughout the day.    There are a number of activities to choose from if you want ranging from yoga to archery spin classes and Pilates. We enjoy sunbathing around the pool and enjoying a good book but it‚Äôs nice to try something new.    The rooms are all brand new with flat screen TVs drench showers and are really comfortable. We just opted for a standard room and loved it but you can opt to stay in a suite or in a room that has a swim up moat to your own private sun beds on your terrace.    There is entertainment every night we have seen belly dancers singers and salsa classes when we have been in but we have also enjoyed making use of the free shuttle that takes you into Marrakesh and picks you up again. This has allowed use to explore and enjoy the city in the mornings and at night.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,mcuk23 wrote a review Jun 2022,40,"Above Average, but not 5 stars",We stayed for 10 days in May our first proper holiday for 2 years after covid. We had a really relaxing and enjoyable break and Overall this hotel is great but it needs some work to get to a 5-star level. Here's my breakdown.    Cleanliness - 5/5 - This is a very clean hotel there's always someone buzzing around sweeping clipping the hedges mopping the floors etc. The rooms were cleaned bedding changed and floors mopped daily. The main reception is very clean and has a lovely diffuser smell to it too. The food areas are always being cleaned by the staff.    Food - 4/5 - Plenty of choices good selection of hot and cold food egg station in the mornings pasta station at night. They changed the menu slightly every day but sometimes dinner felt like you were just eating a reheated rehashed version of whatever was out at lunchtime. They don't serve fast food here other than pizza so no fries nuggets burgers etc The restaurant seemed a little small too and can imagine at full capacity it would be really cramped.    The snack bar is a real letdown the food is really not well presented or thought through. I had a pizza with literally 3 strands of cheese on it. Dry panini with wilted brown salad Cesar salad consists of some lettuce anchovies and 2 chicken nuggets drizzled with mayo. You get a basket of fries with around 10 fries in It's really not 5-star quality at all.    The 1 A la carte restaurant is Moroccan we are both not fans of sweet food which typically Moroccan food is but this was nice. only a choice of Menu A or B but we tried both and they were OK nothing to shout about. The Hotel really could do with another food offering.    Pool areas - 4/5 There are 2 pools one is near the snack bar which we didn't stay at as it was constantly pumping music and loud people everywhere. Felt like a club 18-30 vibe with people drinking way too much and being generally loud. The other pool is much nicer quiet and relaxing however we found people bagging sunbeds early ( which is not uncommon anywhere ) but the annoying thing was people reserving the day beds and then taking 2 sun loungers too. This made a few days a little tricky to get a sun lounger after 9.30 am but we managed all the same. The chap Kamal in the pool bar is great. Run off his feet all day no breaks and always a friendly hello. We tipped him a few dirhams here and there and found that we were never really waiting long for a beer.    Drinks 3/5 - Stork beer ( which is nice ) but tiny little glass bottles gone in 3/4 swigs. The cocktails are literally made up as they go along it seems. We heard several people complain about the lack of alcohol in the drinks but we never experienced this ourselves. The wine is nice and cold dry like pinot grigio style but again you would expect a 5-star resort to have a little choice however there is literally red/white/rose wine and that's it.    Room - 4/5 - Clean and bright our first room was overlooking the car park/road area to the rear of the hotel and we only stayed 1 night. We went to reception to enquire about a swim-up room ( i had emailed ahead and asked and was quoted 700 euro for 10 nights ). At the reception we asked and got a swim-up for 9 nights for around 400 euro. so much less than originally quoted. HOWEVER - I wouldn't bother doing this it really is literally a small cold slither of pool right outside your doors no privacy and ours was next to the walkway so had people constantly walking by. I wouldn't choose this option again but would have changed to a pool facing upper floor room instead.    Overall it's a decent place to stay to get away from the UK for a while. It's Hot and only 3.5 hrs flight from home. The Moroccan people in general are very warm welcoming and friendly. The staff in this hotel are very friendly Azdine in the lobby bar was probably one of the best barmen I've ever come across his friendliness charm and hard-working attitude are great to see. Most of the other staff were great too. There was the occasional grumpy face in the main buffet restaurant but I guess we caught a few of them on an off day. We tipped 20/50 dirham every now and again for good service and we were never really without a table or a drink too.

Activities were offered throughout the day and food and drinks were served whenever you pleased. Bedroom was very comfy and cleaned regularly throughout the day and the hotel as a whole was spotless. However although the food offered was pleasing and extremely reasonable for the price we paid to stay myself and my brother suffered with upset stomachs from most of the trip and one of the nights i actually vomited. This may not have been linked to the food served but considering the milk often smelt like cheese i think it was extremely likely.

During our whole stay the staff were efficient and always had a smile on their faces. The room was brilliant with a comfortable bed and a lovely bathroom. We really loved our outside area with our own terrace and pool. The hotel facilities were great and we loved the pool area and using the swim up bar. Drinks were available all day with good bottled beer and wine but the cocktails were very weak with hardly any alcohol in them. The buffet was excellent and we enjoyed the breakfast  lunch and dinner there. We also enjoyed our meal in the Moroccan Restaurant where again the service was excellent. Overall the food was great but the quality of the drinks could have been better. Whilst we were there we had a birthday and the staff came over with a cake and sang happy birthday.

The mini bar in the room was a big let down and inconvenience though. It only provides a bottle of water. Soft drinks and beers would have been nice as you had to go to one of the pool bars whilst trying to relax in your room swim up pool.  Albeit we had a wonderful much needed relaxing holiday.,Date of stay: April 2022,,"North Yorkshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/587darrenw

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,ericab wrote a review Apr 2022,20,Appalling treatment,A couple of positives but one massive negative.  Starting with the positives our junior suite was lovely very spacious with a very comfortable bed and a great shower various toiletries provided which we didn‚Äôt actually use.  The service in the buffet restaurant was good and the guy who took and delivered drinks orders on the patio area during the evening worked his socks off he could really do with some help.  The quiet pool area was just that; no rush for sun loungers or cabanas nice bar area from 10am.  We did find the food got very repetitive and the buffet area felt cramped when it was busy.  The score of two is for the above comments.  Now the massive negative: On our last afternoon just one bath towel was brought to our room. We discovered this at 5pm when we started to get ready for the evening. We decided not to bring it to anyone‚Äôs attention as we had 2 bathrobes as well as the one towel (also the phone in our room didn‚Äôt work).  When we checked out at 6.15am the following morning we were informed that a towel was missing from our room. We explained that just the one was brought the day before but we were accused of stealing a towel. We invited the receptionist 3 times to look in our suitcases to prove that we hadn‚Äôt taken a towel but he declined and insisted we put a ‚Äòpending charge‚Äô on our credit card which we would receive back once the housekeeper admitted to putting just the one towel in our room. I was very against doing this as I was furious at this accusation which was in front of other guests checking out. My husband eventually agreed to this charge as we knew our airport transfer would be arriving at 6.30am.  I have since emailed and tweeted the hotel regarding this but they have not done me the courtesy of a response.  Due to this we wouldn‚Äôt recommend unless you take photos of exactly what towels are in your room just before you check out.  This was an awful experience for us and we feel we have been treated appallingly. Never again would we visit this hotel or any others in this chain.,Date of stay: April 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"York, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ericab

In addition everyone here is very warm they teach me to speak Arabic help me warmly when I am in trouble help me print materials provide car rental service on time!

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Craig N wrote a review Apr 2022,30,Food a massive let down,The hotel itself is always immaculate. The swim up room we had was lovely. Very big although I wouldn't spend extra on a swim up room again. The water is not heated so it's freezing.    The two outdoor pools offer variety as one is quite active with activities and music with the other being much quieter. I do think it's very disappointing that they don't have poolside waiters for drinks.    The inside bar is just far too small. Frankly ridiculous for a hotel of this size. It can only comfortably seat about 40 people so if you don't get a seat early you're stuck in the lobby or forced to go back to your room. This is something that needs to be urgently looked at as it's the only area of the hotel to spend the evening comfortably. The entertainment start at 10pm which means you're often sitting for a couple of hours waiting for it to start because if you arrive any later you've got no chance of getting a seat.    The food- Sadly the food is pretty dreadful all round. Breakfast is fine with lots of pastries pancakes and fresh omelettes on offer. But the buffet for lunch and dinner is awful and really spoiled our trip. The food is often cold and bland with nothing looking or tasting good. I remember being particularly thrilled at finding some warm turkey breast and lentils which on reflection is pretty pathetic for staying in a 5 star hotel. Comfortably the worst food I've ever had on holiday. The A La Carte restaurant was sadly not much better. The snack bar by the pool is okay and the food is cooked fresh but objectively is only enjoyable because the buffet food is so bad. You're certainly only eating for fuel and not enjoyment which you don't expect from a five star hotel.    Drink- the alcohol is okay. What you expect from an all inclusive resort like this. Watered down spirits and the cocktails are hit and miss depending on who makes them. The only 'safe' drink every time was the draught beer which was actually alright. It was also very difficult to get hold of bottled water in the morning which was frankly ridiculous. They also don't provide much in the way of tea coffee or milk in the room and guests were always asking for extras.    Staff- The staff were generally nice and helpful but I didn't find the staff in the buffet restaurant to be that friendly.    Location- the hotel is a good 20-30mins outside the city and sadly there is literally nothing in the immediate area which is a real shame if you want a break from the awful food. The shuttle bus is good and drops you straight outside the main square in Marakech.    Sadly I really wouldn't recommend this hotel unless you get a stupidly cheap deal and great weather. It's far too expensive for what it is and that is mainly down to the awful food.,Date of stay: April 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D2113WJcraign

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Cinderz L wrote a review Apr 2022,30,Lovely hotel but not 5*,This may just be a long review so please prepare yourself for a read but most importantly will be very honest!!    We arrived at the hotel very late since there was a delay with our flight (easyjet of course) anyway arrived at the hotel which is in the middle of no where not even a shop about at least 15 to 20mins cab ride which is 300dhms. Once at the hotel you go past security gates no one can get in the hotel unless they're staying at the hotel which is great and the hotel also is guarded 24hours by security you will see them everywhere around the grounds at night. At the reception at check in they will obviously ask for your passport as usual but also a room deposit which I was confused about as this was not written anywhere on the booking. It says at reception it is 600dhms roughly 50 sterling but depending on the receptionist the charge will differ as we got charged 1000dhms which is just over 80 sterling. They take this either by debit/credit card or even cash also you can change up money at the hotel which I highly suggest as the exchange rate is amazing it was 12dhms to the pound.  The room we had was lovely it was right at the back with 2 double beds which were so comfy best sleep I've had in a long time. The bathroom was lovely too and our room was cleaned daily I have no complaints there at all!! In fact the hotel itself was exceptionally clean it was cleaned every day by the staff. The reception floor was buffed every day so be careful so slippery sometimes.  The pools were absolutely lovely clean too was just a dream to just lay there with no kids running about. The animation team were lovely too always trying to get people involved with activities. So there was water aerobics archery belly dancing yoga football basketball and general pool games oh and gym stuff.  The spa wow what can I say AMAZINGwe got the hammam which was 500 dhms so just over 40 sterling and was incredible skin was so soft. I highly recommend the spa the whole team were lovely.  The drinks well they all tasted like water to me tye alcohol is very weak but I fond this on all inclusive holidays that the alcohol is weak. I always say add more but made no difference. The lobby bar their bartenders were fab knew your drinks before you even walked over!!    Right the food what can I say NOT 5*it was very bad some days freezing cold as if it came straight from the fridge. The breakfast you have Your usual pancakesomelette stations which was lovely the moroccon pancakes were amazing. Lunch time is when the disaster started their was plenty choice but the food was not good very bland and same goes for dinner. In fact you will see the same meal several times over the week repeated day after day after day. The desserts were also a repeat of the day before loads of choice but just on repeat.  The pool bar was okay but nothing to award 5* at all!!    We used the shuttle bus into the market which was great good tip turn your hotel braclet inside out as the people at the market will pretend they're from the hotel!!    There is a photographer at the hotel too each photo is 50dhms his really good at his job so take a look.    The evening entertainment I think was touch and go as its covid there is not a lot of seats so if you want to see the entertainment have dinner early and grab a seat.  The a la carte we never even went the menu was not great at all so we took the best of the bad bunch and stuck at the buffet.    Is this hotel 5* hell no it is not the grounds and the spa could be considered as 4*+ but with 5* you would expect everything to be of a higher standard which the food and drinks is not. I would say 3*+ if including the food.    Oh wait I forgot there is no food after 10pm or drinks after midnight i think it was so if you're flight is delayed like ours and you would like some snacks just to fill you there won't be none. I have been to 3* hotels who have provided a snack bar for me and my family if we have arrived later than expected. Again this would be a nice touch of you're arriving at 5* hotel especially when there is not a single shop in the area.    There is a mini shop/souvenir shop in the hotel but that shuts at 10.30pm they sell crispchocolate and little souvenirs but no drinks!!!    I think I've covered everything would I go back to this hotel unfortunately not its not worth the money.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Thislifeis4living wrote a review Apr 2022,40,Amazing Experience for 2 friends from the UK - UA,The experience was great. Lovely polite attentive staff especially when dining remembering your drinks order and trying to see if you are enjoying your time with them. Rooms cleaned every day fresh breakfast every morning. The lunch felt sometimes like a rotation of the night before's dinner and could do with more variations as my only improvement. The excursions manager wasn't clear on his price which I felt was a bit disappointing so perhaps book elsewhere for this part. Lubna was very polite and lovely at the front desk and Ayoub at the snack bar was always friendly and serving with a smile. I will definitely stay again this year or next. Another feedback is please try to put on a shuttle to the city between 12 - 2 most people want to go into town for lunch if they do not enjoy the lunch options available or after breakfast and this was not available as only 10am and 4pm was available. It is about 20mins into the main centre but worth staying as it is so peaceful and clean.,Date of stay: March 2022,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thislifeis4living

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Sarah W wrote a review Apr 2022,40,Lovely week in the sun,We‚Äôve just come back from a weeks stay and we had a wonderful time!    The hotel is lovely and maintained to a high standard. The grounds are well kept with gardeners each day. There are two pools one more quiet and the other larger and busier. We stayed by the quiet one as it has a swim up bar. There were plenty of sun beds but the hotel wasn‚Äôt full so I can imagine in peak season you would need to get one earlier on.    There are two bars outside. One where you can order food by the larger pool and the swim up bar. The main one usually had two staff members serving and it could‚Äôve done with 3. The pool bar was manned by Kamal and he looked after us superbly and was interesting to talk to. Sometimes there needed to be two of him as he was rushed off his feet!    The buffet restaurant was well organised food was varied and delicious. Sometimes things could‚Äôve been a bit hotter but everything was fresh and tasty.    The a la carte wasn‚Äôt worth it. Things were over cooked and desert was bland. We were done in 45 mins.    Food was ok at the pool bar outside burgers panini etc.    There needs to be another bar for evenings. There was only capacity for 35 inside of an evening and when it was chilly we were sat in the reception area which had no atmosphere.    We had a twin room with really comfortable beds although pillows were a bit too soft. We had a terrace which caught the sun in the evenings. There‚Äôs a fridge in the room with a large bottle of water each day. The aircon helped on warmer nights. The shower was fabulous. Great pressure and always hot water. We made use of the complimentary toiletries too.    We used the shuttle bus into the medina a few times and it was always on time.    Now to the staff‚Ä¶. They work so hard in the heat and particularly as we visited during Ramadan. Special thanks to Kamal at the pool bar Rajaa who took great care of us at breakfast and lunch Hicham who looked after us at dinner and Azdine who always remembered our evening drink order.    We had a great week in the sunshine at a decent price via TUI. It made visiting Marrakech so easy.

Room beautifully clean and spacious only fault with it  screen over bath is so long you can't reach the taps. The few people I spoke to about it were getting in it to run it .You have a shower cubicle as well so I just used that to much hassle although I do love baths .Only other complaint a big lack of coffee so if you are a coffee lover take a small jar and coffee mate or similar( they will give you milk at the bar but struggle to find coffee sachets )  We had a hammam in the spa which was wonderful little bit pricey compared to outside but very tranquil the spa is very well kept and worth a visit.  Restaurant food is pretty good lots of choice quite often seafood which my partner loves (King prawns Octopus Squid etc.) hard to get hot food ( the hotel was not very busy which might be the reason - not enough turnaround )  A la carte restaurant a bit disappointing book early to avoid ensure you get in and be prepared to pick your menus (2 set choices ) when you book your table at reception The restaurant was only open Wednesday and Sunday when we were there ( mid March)  The grounds are beautiful and well kept  not massive but bigger than the sister hotel .Plenty of sunbeds with space between them .Pool bar food and staff good plenty of seating Food freshly cooked so hot !  Entertainment varies so some nights better than others lovely staff and the waiter is amazing and more so if you tip him .  All told a good hotel and the staff are lovelyI've only given it 4 stars because the room was badly cleaned on the regular cleaners day off the lack of coffee and regular tea bags but mainly because of the atrocious motion lighting in the hall ways and steps that is so delayed it caused me to spend my last day in the room with no food ( not allowed to take it out of the restaurant) ) With a very swollen ankle caused by missing footing going down the steps in the dark .,Date of stay: March 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bournemouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BackPacker785472
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,iqbal wrote a review Mar 2022,30,Hotel review,Hotel was very nice staff friendly but sadly customer services was a let down.due to no flexibility to late check out although the hotel was empty they still wanted to charge for few extra hours. First indication was no rooms available. Then the member of staff said if you pay 300 dirahams we can let you stay extra few hours . Also asked us to use inadequate spa shower then my wife was not allowed to use hair dryer or power point. My wife had to come all the way back to reception with wet hair and ask again for hair dryer disappointed.,Date of stay: March 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/470iqbalh
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Samantha H wrote a review Mar 2022,50,Brilliant hotel and staff,The staff here are amazing they cannot be more friendly and helpful. I must say a special mention of Azdine the waiter in the Lobby Bar - - he works so very hard. The pool was clean and heated and loved the cabana‚Äôs. There‚Äôs entertainment during the day but it‚Äôs by choice. The resort is lovely and very clean. We cannot fault it. We took a trip to Ait Ben Haddou and various other places around the Atlas Mountains booked through the hotel onsite. It was a good price for a private driver who was very knowledgeable and taught us much about the culture and heritage. Definitely recommend.,Date of stay: March 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q9083EIsamanthah

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Lee Mc wrote a review Mar 2022,50,Wonderful holiday,We stayed at the be live collection for 7 days in March 22.    This is the first time we have been to Marrakesh and in all honesty was not my choice of destination. With all inclusive holidays I am very nervous when it come to cheap places. I‚Äôm a believer of you get what you pay for! Well I was wrong with this hotel! It was brilliant!    I when we checked in the room wasn‚Äôt ready and check in was 3pm. They checked you in so you could use the all inclusive and I asked if there was a room to change in so we could sunbathe. They gave us a room and we was able to get changed and enjoy our first day.    Hotel staff:  The hotel staff from the gardeners cleaners maintenance men to the guest relations staff and beyond where amazing! Always smiling and alway a hello or Bonjour! The restaurant staff where brilliant we where always greeted in the morning and at lunch by Medhi he always kept the wine and water topped up he was brilliant! The lobby bar is where we spent every evening and there is live music dance shows & Karaoke. It was a good laugh. The bar staff in this place where amazing joining in with the entertainment team to get the guests dancing etc was great. Oussama was brilliant and on the odd time you went to the bar greeted you like you where his family was so pleasant I do have to say though Azdine who is the server in the lobby bar most nights was excellent! The man never stops I‚Äôm a pretty big drinker and my glass was never empty. Thank you!    The food:  We where pleasantly surprised with the food. Our overall opinion was it was lovely! There was only one issue I had (the Mrs didn‚Äôt have this) was they use a oil dressing on somethings that‚Äôs a little annoying but edible! Nothing‚Äôs perfect but thought I would point that out. We ate2/3 times a day always full and happy with the choices! The desserts where amazing so much choice and we did enjoy it a lot!    General:  The hotel is very clean and tidy. Our room was cleaned everyday and could not fault anything. I‚Äôm pretty much glass half full so if you want to go looking for things I‚Äôm sure you will find them! But nothing that is going to spoil your stay unless you want it to!    I think the trip was huge value for money and the hotel is great. It is situated a little out of the way but the hotel put a free bus that takes you into Marrakesh. We didn‚Äôt use this as we decided last minute to go into Marrakesh and a taxi was only 150 DN (around ¬£12.5).    We enjoyed it hope you do if you decide to go!,Date of stay: March 2022,,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leebmc

I‚Äôm very picky when comes to food or drinks but everything was 5*. The staff is so fast going you literally have no time to leave the fork down and the dishes are gone well done team! The bed was amazing slept like a baby every night. The rooms are clean and spacious the pool view are probably the best option. The bartenders the waiters( from the restaurant bar or snack bar) the chefs the receptionist are all great!  We tried ( and it‚Äôs a must ) the 2 h treatment in their SPA - hamam + full body scrub + 30/30 relaxing & head massage. It‚Äôs amazing I‚Äôll take the massage everyday next time as it will defo be a next time!  Thank you for having us!    P.S: if you‚Äôre planning any trip to the Souk I‚Äôll highly recommend you to get a guid from the hotel!

Alcoholic drinks weren‚Äôt very strong so did taste like juice so have to ask to be strong or order shots to add in. Entertainment was good and the team were great fun! Medhi at the excursions desk was a huge help in organising trips and taxis and the prices were very valuable! A huge thank you to Hamza Ayoub and Youness at the snack bar they looked after us all week made our experience very personalised by taking time to get to know us and made us laugh. Ayoub also helped me with a table reservation I had outside the hotel as I couldn‚Äôt read much French so he helped me translate. We really enjoyed meeting them all.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,CMCP1993 wrote a review Nov 2021,50,Fabulous hotel- best stay ever!,Wow. Where to begin. The hotel itself is fabulous so clean modern and beautiful decor. Two pools a swim up bar loads of activities. But the main thing that stands out is the entertainment and the staff.    Firstly the entertainment. The night we arrived we went to the lobby bar as there was still music on. What a buzz. The DJ was amazing and had the whole crowd on the dance floor. There was such a good atmosphere we were so surprised and so happy we chose this hotel. Every night there is a theme and different entertainment we seen belly dancers a live band etc. Honestly the best entertainment I have Experienced in a hotel.    Secondly the staff. There is too many to mention by name but all of the staff are amazing. The bar staff are so friendly get everyone dancing remember your favourite drink etc. The pool guys are so fun and not pushy if you don‚Äôt want to participate in games. The reception / public relations are amazing. They were so helpful arranging for our antigen test and had someone to come to the hotel to do this. Also so helpful organising taxis and providing us with maps and tips of where to go. The staff will really go out of their way to help you and it never felt like too much.    Finally RastaMan Zanjii. He is the hotel photographer and is fantastic. He is so professional and took amazing photos for such a reasonable price. We were late back to hotel after an excursion and had arranged to meet Zanjii there to collect our photos. He waited for us which we were so grateful for. Im so happy we have these memories so really recommend getting photos taken by him.    I cannot fault this hotel. The room was so spacious and modern and we were met with a platter of fresh fruit and treats when we arrived.    Thank you so much Be Live.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Becky W wrote a review Nov 2021,50,The staff made us feel like family,We had planned to stay at the hotel for a month but had to leave early due to new COVID restrictions in place stopping UK flights in and out of the country. We stayed for 3 weeks in the end.  We absolutely loved our time at the Be Live. From the moment we arrived to our sad goodbyes the staff were just wonderful. They always went the extra mile and truly made us feel welcome. After the last few years we needed a break and the Be Live Collection delivered.    The staff  First I was to shout out to Azzdine on the bar. He had our drinks memorised by the second day. Even on nights when it was crazy busy he worked so hard and it never went unnoticed. We never had to go to the bar to order he would always find us and keep our drinks topped up.  Mahdi on the travel desk was an angel. He made sure we could do all the things we wanted to to make the most out of our stay. The 3day excursion through the Atlas Mountains to the Sahara Desert was our favourite- cannot recommended enough! And incredibly good value for money!! Mahdi was a real sweetie and booking through him was so easy.  Marwa on the front desk was very sweet looking after us. Always greeted with a smile and was genuinely keen to know how we were enjoying our stay in Morocco. She gave us some great tips about the city and when we told her we had to leave early she was crushed. She was planning to give us a special meal on one of our last nights in the Moroccan restaurant.  Smilie and Mamadou and the entertainment staff were fantastic. So much energy and a great sense of humour. They kept the vibes at the ‚Äúloud pool‚Äù going and the water aerobics were never dull!  Youness and the young lads on the snack bar were always so so kind and greeted us with smiles every day. It could get busy but they worked so hard and quickly it was never a long wait.  And the waiting staff at the canteen- there was a young girl in the evenings with bling hair (never caught her name) who worked so hard and always had a smile on her face. And Raja in the breakfast team was always a welcome sight in the mornings. The food was fresh delicious and had so much variety. It was always a good meal ever night! The Moroccan restaurant is absolutely worth checking out!  And the cleaners were amazing! They made fun towel animals for when we came back from our excursions. Little touches like that made such a difference.    Pools:  The pools were brilliant- a quiet chill out vibe pool. And a more energetic pool with music and games. Both were a decent size and well maintained.    The grounds:  The grounds weren‚Äôt too big so nothing was too far away. The gardens are beautifully maintained.    Bar:  The drinks are all delicious! Some familiar drinks and some interesting new ones to try. Loved the Marrakesh Flower!    Location:  It‚Äôs not far from town and the free shuttle is easy to book.    Excursions:  We did Essaouira quad biking hot air Balloon ride Marrakesh the Atlas Mountains and Sahara desert. All amazing!! We wanted to do the waterfalls too but as we had to leave early we missed out.    The rooms:  Comfy bed and great pillows. Clean. Bright. Good water pressure in the showers and a nice deep bath to sit in too. Lots of storage and the safe for our valuables.

When arriving at this venue the staff were rude and uninterested. We had to wait hours for our room to be ready so made our way to the buffet. The food was so basic and remained the same for the 9 days we stayed there. It was luke warm and never hot however the worst part was the flies on everything including the food/tables. I couldn‚Äôt remember a day where there wasn‚Äôt a fly either on me or trying to get on my food. There was nothing being done about this problem either it just appeared the ‚Äò‚Äônorm‚Äô‚Äô. Then surprise surprise 2 days later I was ill and so was my partner with really bad food poisoning. Multiple staff were told about this but didn‚Äôt care. Whilst bed bound in the room the smell of sewers from outside drains was so strong and the noise from surrounding rooms made it unbearable.

Unfortunately not. On our 2nd night my partner fell sick with food poisoning (no surprise). This completely ruined the holiday for her and to make matters worse the 3 hotel staff that I informed offered ABSOLUTELY NO HELP OR ADVISE! despite being told a guest in their hotel is sick. Shocking. I ended up purchasing Imodium and paracetamol from the small hotel shop. The flies were also consistently all over the snack bar where again drinks are prepared.

Fantastic service from all staff and a swim up room just was the best. Would suggest though that a choice is given about changing towels every day in your room because if eco and also don't always use them . All staff are professional in every way. Restaurant food was delicious and so nice to see no fast food like chips. 5 star all the way and I never eat dessert but here omg delicious. Entertainment was funny and was mostly in French due to clientele but in these type of countries it was above the standard . Great pool bar with hamal and busy pool was energetic without going on. The rooms are exceptional offering additional items such as toothbrush showering goodsslippers and Bath robes. Fridge in room with fresh water And tea n coffee facilities too. Only negative thing was on checkout that was charged for a stain on beach towel which within 5day holiday only changed once as limited use and therefore very annoyed at 6am to be challenged on damage to a towel without evidence and a cost of ‚Ç¨25for a stain...very disappointed as clearly if we saw Stain would have asked fir clean towel.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Becky W wrote a review Nov 2021,50,The staff made us feel like family,We had planned to stay at the hotel for a month but had to leave early due to new COVID restrictions in place stopping UK flights in and out of the country. We stayed for 3 weeks in the end.  We absolutely loved our time at the Be Live. From the moment we arrived to our sad goodbyes the staff were just wonderful. They always went the extra mile and truly made us feel welcome. After the last few years we needed a break and the Be Live Collection delivered.    The staff  First I was to shout out to Azzdine on the bar. He had our drinks memorised by the second day. Even on nights when it was crazy busy he worked so hard and it never went unnoticed. We never had to go to the bar to order he would always find us and keep our drinks topped up.  Mahdi on the travel desk was an angel. He made sure we could do all the things we wanted to to make the most out of our stay. The 3day excursion through the Atlas Mountains to the Sahara Desert was our favourite- cannot recommended enough! And incredibly good value for money!! Mahdi was a real sweetie and booking through him was so easy.  Marwa on the front desk was very sweet looking after us. Always greeted with a smile and was genuinely keen to know how we were enjoying our stay in Morocco. She gave us some great tips about the city and when we told her we had to leave early she was crushed. She was planning to give us a special meal on one of our last nights in the Moroccan restaurant.  Smilie and Mamadou and the entertainment staff were fantastic. So much energy and a great sense of humour. They kept the vibes at the ‚Äúloud pool‚Äù going and the water aerobics were never dull!  Youness and the young lads on the snack bar were always so so kind and greeted us with smiles every day. It could get busy but they worked so hard and quickly it was never a long wait.  And the waiting staff at the canteen- there was a young girl in the evenings with bling hair (never caught her name) who worked so hard and always had a smile on her face. And Raja in the breakfast team was always a welcome sight in the mornings. The food was fresh delicious and had so much variety. It was always a good meal ever night! The Moroccan restaurant is absolutely worth checking out!  And the cleaners were amazing! They made fun towel animals for when we came back from our excursions. Little touches like that made such a difference.    Pools:  The pools were brilliant- a quiet chill out vibe pool. And a more energetic pool with music and games. Both were a decent size and well maintained.    The grounds:  The grounds weren‚Äôt too big so nothing was too far away. The gardens are beautifully maintained.    Bar:  The drinks are all delicious! Some familiar drinks and some interesting new ones to try. Loved the Marrakesh Flower!    Location:  It‚Äôs not far from town and the free shuttle is easy to book.    Excursions:  We did Essaouira quad biking hot air Balloon ride Marrakesh the Atlas Mountains and Sahara desert. All amazing!! We wanted to do the waterfalls too but as we had to leave early we missed out.    The rooms:  Comfy bed and great pillows. Clean. Bright. Good water pressure in the showers and a nice deep bath to sit in too. Lots of storage and the safe for our valuables.

Always greeted with a smile and was genuinely keen to know how we were enjoying our stay in Morocco. She gave us some great tips about the city and when we told her we had to leave early she was crushed. She was planning to give us a special meal on one of our last nights in the Moroccan restaurant.  Smilie and Mamadou and the entertainment staff were fantastic. So much energy and a great sense of humour. They kept the vibes at the ‚Äúloud pool‚Äù going and the water aerobics were never dull!  Youness and the young lads on the snack bar were always so so kind and greeted us with smiles every day. It could get busy but they worked so hard and quickly it was never a long wait.  And the waiting staff at the canteen- there was a young girl in the evenings with bling hair (never caught her name) who worked so hard and always had a smile on her face. And Raja in the breakfast team was always a welcome sight in the mornings. The food was fresh delicious and had so much variety. It was always a good meal ever night! The Moroccan restaurant is absolutely worth checking out!  And the cleaners were amazing! They made fun towel animals for when we came back from our excursions. Little touches like that made such a difference.    Pools:  The pools were brilliant- a quiet chill out vibe pool. And a more energetic pool with music and games. Both were a decent size and well maintained.    The grounds:  The grounds weren‚Äôt too big so nothing was too far away. The gardens are beautifully maintained.    Bar:  The drinks are all delicious! Some familiar drinks and some interesting new ones to try. Loved the Marrakesh Flower!    Location:  It‚Äôs not far from town and the free shuttle is easy to book.    Excursions:  We did Essaouira quad biking hot air Balloon ride Marrakesh the Atlas Mountains and Sahara desert. All amazing!! We wanted to do the waterfalls too but as we had to leave early we missed out.    The rooms:  Comfy bed and great pillows. Clean. Bright. Good water pressure in the showers and a nice deep bath to sit in too. Lots of storage and the safe for our valuables. Sometimes our cards didn‚Äôt work getting in but the reception fixed that in 2 seconds.    In short- if you‚Äôre going to Marrakesh stay here.,Date of stay: October 2021,,"Malaga, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Spag08
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Becky W wrote a review Nov 2021,50,The staff made us feel like family,We had planned to stay at the hotel for a month but had to leave early due to new COVID restrictions in place stopping UK flights in and out of the country. We stayed for 3 weeks in the end.  We absolutely loved our time at the Be Live. From the moment we arrived to our sad goodbyes the staff were just wonderful. They always went the extra mile and truly made us feel welcome. After the last few years we needed a break and the Be Live Collection delivered.    The staff  First I was to shout out to Azzdine on the bar. He had our drinks memorised by the second day. Even on nights when it was crazy busy he worked so hard and it never went unnoticed. We never had to go to the bar to order he would always find us and keep our drinks topped up.  Mahdi on the travel desk was an angel.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,bryanwalsh54 wrote a review Oct 2021,50,A great relaxing holiday,The hotel was perfect for a weeks holiday. There isn't much to do in the area so if you want a week packed with just sun food and drink it's perfect. If you want to get out and do things then it's a little more tricky. There's a rep doing trips from the hotel and there's a twice daily shuttle into town. I'd suggest paying for a taxi as the shuttle brings you so far away from the square that you will get lost if you don't have Internet to bring you back. The staff are amazing food is great! The drinks could have more alcohol in them so you have to be creative when ordering cocktails and asking for a spirit with ice separately!,Date of stay: October 2021,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bryanwalsh54
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Mathew Stevens wrote a review Oct 2021,50,Brilliant first time in Marrakech,I have just returned from a weeks stay at this lovely hotel. We met plenty of English and french people in the hotel as i was worried many English wouldn‚Äôt be here. The staff are fantastic! A lady with blonde/brown hair served us daily in the restaurant and was fantastic. A HUGE shout out to Ayoub at the snack bar brilliant young lad with very good customer service always keep us fed and watered.  The rooms ‚Ä¶ WOW‚Ä¶ the beds are AMAZING and I didn‚Äôt want to come back home to my own bed. Rooms are spotlessly clean and very Modern with plenty of plugs separate bath and walk in shower. Rooms cleaned daily with fresh sheets and towels.  The food was fantastic in the main buffet restaurant. The A La Carte was not so good. We waited far too long for food and walked our before our mains and went to the buffet restaurant instead as we were scared we wouldn‚Äôt get any food at all. 1 hour and 40 minutes we waited for a main course. Thankfully this didn‚Äôt bother us at all we just knew to not return to that restaurant. Amazing sports bar as well. The pools are great.. we stayed around the quieter pool and used the swim up bar a lot! Loved it.  I can not wait to return here next year. Thank you to all.,Date of stay: October 2021,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/767mathews

Staff are so friendly hotel is clean and good is great! The beds are so comfortable too. Perfect weather and facilities are ideal. There is a chilled pool with swim up bar(pool is freezing though although nice when very hot outside) and another pool with more activities. I also use a walking stick and the hotel was great size for me. Also TUI where great with support in the airports on a separate note. There is an 11pm curfew and that's great. Free bus to the medina too and well worth a visit. The hotel were great to arrange private taxis too. Staff serving always remember your preferences and this makes a difference to the experience very respectful and make communication easy. Special shout out too Ayeoub Hassan and various other staff whose names escape me. Only downside is the local alcohol as very low content so don't expect to get very tipsy! I will certainly be visiting again!,Date of stay: October 2021,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N666RKangelar

There is a chilled pool with swim up bar(pool is freezing though although nice when very hot outside) and another pool with more activities.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Marie R wrote a review Mar 2020,30,Too warm in the rooms- NO AC,DO NOT BOOK HERE if you expect AC in your room ( cold air) when its 32c outside and you are facing the sun.Stayed here March 3rd for 4 days. Booked with Alpha Rooms which I am now speaking too and also the hotel. Being reviewing for years now travel a lot and try to be as honest as possible. Neither of their websites says its seasonal.We stayed in 3 hotels on our 8 days in Marrakesh. 4 days here with myself and my wife I will do the negatives first as there are positives also. Booked and paid extra for superior room with pool view. Rooms good on arrival it was toast and always have AC as I suffer with anxiety which I explained to the hotel the shock of a 5 star hotel not having dual AC was off the scale. I went down to see the manger and you cant speak to the manager as they have 2 girls working shift Public relations they are called explained my situation got no where they made out I was the only one as it happens we spoke to three other couples whom complained also. They moved us to a twin room quickly which was good requested a fan which they laughed at seriously. Tried to get over it and move on but the heat in the evening after been at the pool dont book this if this is not your thing check!!  Bad points ;  1) Sparrows flying all round the restaurant landing on the bread boards and sitting there eating the crumbs for as long as they like ( manager standing within two feet one day) we asked why and he had no explanation. (we have photos and video if the manger wants them we found this amazing as we can only assume they work best practice in the kitchens and along with the Covid -19 starting to spread.  2) As others pointed out music start @ 10am and goes through to the sports bar and people shouting and roaring till 3am I am all on for a bit of banter but if you dont like it lump it or go to the city at night and day. Entertainment hit and miss. It just seems to be loud all day. Just to note with no AC we had to leave the doors open which we told the PR people!!  3) No AC as above  4) Public Relations of no use ( even though they are nice people like talking to SKY TV people when you have an issue you will know what I am talking about.  5) There is another pool down the other end which is not heated but very quiet and beautiful IF THE POOL WAS HEATED what a shame.  6) The restaurant area is way too small and they are building more units its lovely but too small too long waiting on staff at dinner to request a glass of wine.  7) Traditional Moroccan restaurant was useless and this was the opinion of many what a waste of time if you are going to do it please do it or make it a bar area as there are not enough seats out front.  POSITIVES ;  1) Bar staff and usually ( not the managers) cleaning staff were excellent Yassin and Azdine in the bar and some of the guys and girls in the restaurant the stars of the hotel. Even under pressure they were soooo nice and good crack.  2) Food generally really good  good variety and seemed always fresh. Good mix of fresh meats been carved and stir fry really good.  3) Heated pool great and clean  4) Late breakfast at the pool area a really great idea and served to you a real plus.  5) Rooms and area spotless - no issues    I hope the above is received as an honest review because that is what it is I am hoping the manger responds as it would have been nice to have the chance to speak to him / her. This place is only 2 years old and I would say they have and know made mistakes with planning as there are such empty spaces that could be used better and restaurants etc. One thing to note we meet another couple whom both worked in Hygiene ( they met the manger and mentioned the birds). This really has to stop. Hard to believe its happening. They are flying rats with huge bacteria.Overall the hotel is good ruined my week as could not relax with the heat in the room this must be made more clear on their own site which its not. Location is 20-30 mins outside of city depending on traffic nothing around anywhere near the hotel shuttle bus runs but at odd times for returning.,Date of stay: March 2020,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marierI3135RV

Room was large and well laid out the view could have been better as we were not pool facing. The all inclusive food was very good will quality and good choice. Restaurant could be busy at times but staff always willing to help. The house wine was very good. The bar staff worked very hard as very busy at times. Entertainment staff were very friendly and tried to get you involved if you wanted to. Main pool is heated and great the other pool is not and can be very cold depending on time of the year. A greater flexibility on check out time would be appreciated with late departure flights. Pool bar lunchtime paninis and pizza were great.

This despite there being other vacant double rooms in the hotel that they could put us in.    Buffet is poor .. the hot food is gone quicker than they can cook it.    Sadly it is my first day here.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Looby loo wrote a review Mar 2020,40,18to30+,This hotel is lovely. The staff the cleanliness the rooms the food. I have no complaints.  There are two pools. One heated and noisy with quite loud music although sometimes the music man plays relaxing music. The other pool away from music but cold.  Moroccan people are very friendly and all the staff were wonderful. THERE IS A BUT.  MUSIC! If you intend having a nice quiet drink after dinner or going to bed before midnight forget it. Not enough waiters or assortment of drinks mean the cocktails are not really up to scratch but I don't drink much so it wasn't a problem for me. What I and many guests had a problem with Was The music After 10pm. Outside and loud. So loud even with all doors shut earphones on and a pillow over your head you still can't escape it. Add to that air-con doesn't work till April. No fan In room so you really need the doors open. We arrived Friday. Got no sleep that night. Remember this is all inclusive. People have been drinking all day and 'enjoying the music' till midnight then drinking some more and they have to pass everybody's room to get to there's. Just when the music stops and you think you can finally get some sleep the drunks start shouting and making as much noise as they can.  We did complain and they music was put inside but only one night.  I loved my holiday and this hotel I would return but wish they would be more considerate to people who don't like listening to BAM BAM BAM all night.,Date of stay: March 2020,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rusandmeg

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Daniel H wrote a review Mar 2020,50,Luxury stay on the outskirts of Marrakech,I was fortunate to spend a week at Be Live Collection Marrakech and I am extremely happy with my stay. The room was spacious and spotless the cleaning staff do an excellent job of cleaning both the rooms and all the common areas such as hallways and the main reception area. All the staff without exception are hard working and very courteous they are a credit to the establishment and are almost certainly it's most valuable asset.    The food offered is fresh and very tasty as with every all inclusive I have visited the main restaurant is a buffet. It offers a wide variety of choices which rotate on a daily basis. A special mention to the desserts which are absolutely amazing and leaves you spoilt for choice. The alternative a la carte restaurant requires prebooking and offers a choice of 2 set menus but sadly no veggie options which I thought was an oversight.    The resort also offers a complimentary shuttle bus to the city centre that is prompt and only requires pre-booking to ensure you can utilise it which I strongly recommend. The hotel lies about 15-25 mins (traffic permitting) from the city centre so this is vital if you wish to see more of Marrakesh.    My only two misgivings about my stay were that plastic straws were used and also provided with every drink so if you are environmentally minded may find that alarming. Could paper straws not be used and only provided when guests request them?    The second issue I encountered was when I attempted to book a treatment at the spa. The receptionist insisted on taking cash as payment in fact this was done in quite an abrupt manner. She instructed that cash can be accessed from the ATM at reception but as I prefer to make large payments on card I decided not to proceed with the booking.    The two issues aside I had a great stay and would recommend the resort highly.,Date of stay: March 2020,,"Gomersal, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CleckLad

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Dee wrote a review Mar 2020,50,Amazing short break!!,Brought my partner here for his birthday. Both of our first times in morocco. Couldn't fault the hotel one bit. It was beautiful! Stunning rooms (we had a superior double). The layout of the hotel was easy to navigate as it is quite small.  When we arrived we were given wrist bands straight away and told to get some lunch while our room was being finished.  By the time we ate and got a drink we went back to reception to get the keys. Pay the deposit and tourist tax. All very smooth.  There was activities on every day yoga archery mini golf zumba and aqua aerobics.  We were never bored.  The animation pool was cold but not as cold as the pool with the swim up bar.  There was always a sunbed free. Loads of games in the sports bar.  Drinks at breakfast were a bit slow I think they could change it at breakfast to self service. Missed having my coffee in the morning.  Mini bar wasnt stocked with milk for coffee in the room. But that didn't bother me. There was always water in there.  There was something on every night entertainment wise. The restaurant on site was a nice change food was just ok but the wine was nice.  We paid for quad biking through the guy at the hotel. He was very nice and the lads that greeted us at quad biking and the young lad that took us around were lovely. They did struggle with english. So a learning a few french words would be handy.  Would if loved to stay longer as we were there for 4 nights.  It's well worth the money and would 100% recommend this.

We visited Marrokko for the first time and we were a little bit sceptical about the all-inclusive concept but were pleasantly surprised about the high quality and diversity of the food at Belive. For ten days we enjoyed it every day! Several chefs preparing meat an fish in portions so always fresh and good temperature.Every day fresh baked bread and pasterie. Staff was working very hard always friendly and we never had to wait long te be served. White wine was of a nice quality and no problem to get a bottle in ice at our table. Pool bar served during inbetween times great sandwiches burgers pizza etc.  Shuttle service to Marrakech and 2 outisde pools (one of them heated) were very nice to make use of.  Only small negative we found was the 1 time optional use of the alacarte Marrokan restaurant it is actually not alacarte but a choice out of 2 menu's which we didn't like to much. No problem though as said the buffet restaurant was excellent.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Lizveall wrote a review Feb 2020,50,Winter sun guarantee,I booked this resort for a few days of sun in the middle of February and the weather did not disappoint and it was pretty quiet - never a bun fight for sun beds! Beautiful weather beautiful room. Comfortable beds and a great rainfall shower in a spacious well-appointed bathroom. I would recommend the swim up rooms if you like a bit of quiet sunbathing just outside your room but don‚Äôt let them give you rooms ending in 09 or 10 - they are set back and don‚Äôt get sun til 4pm!    We did book spa treatments but didn‚Äôt really enjoy them. I really hate it when the therapist spends 20 of the 50 minutes out of the room while you lie there with masks on - they should at least do a hand/foot treatment!    I loved the yoga and aqua aerobics classes- brilliant activities team. There are two pools - one heated and a little bit shabby and the quiet unheated pool which was beautiful and had a swim up bar but in Feb was just too cold to use.    The food was typical of an all inclusive buffet but there was plenty for my daughter (carnivore) and me (vegetarian) to eat. I have to say the house wine (local red white and rose) was fantastic. I didn‚Äôt try any of the spirits or cocktails so can‚Äôt say how they were.    All in all a great holiday provided by TUI - the communication from the local rep Azzeddine was excellent but not intrusive and all the transfer and flight arrangements were spot on.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,sammyjay73 wrote a review Feb 2020,40,Relaxed and chilled,My husband and I have just returned from a week at this hotel.  I am sad not to give it 5 stars but I will explain why.  The hotel is lovely we were greeted on arrival with a Moroccan tea and cake which was lovely. The Reception staff were all lovely and extremely helpful. Nothing was too much trouble. We asked to move as we had noisy neighbours but only due to the fact that the rooms had an adjoining door(which seems odd for an adult only hotel) and this was no trouble. They moved all our stuff for us.  The food is of an ok quality but the same everyday and they can not cook quick enough at the hot plate.  The entertainment team are amazing and made the holiday Monsef and Zouhir are lovely men and it was lovely to get to know them and learn a bit about their lives in Morocco.  There was never a fight for a sun lounger even at peak times of the day.  What does need 5 stars Is the Spa. My husband and I both work hard so treated ourselves to one of their packages. Definitely worth every penny. The women doing the treatments are amazing and make you feel so relaxed and at ease.  We met some lovely people and had an amazing time.  One question for the hotel. What do you classify as an adult. Having 16 year olds there does not classify as an adult and to be fair I felt sorry for them as there is nothing for them to do.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Darbs wrote a review Feb 2020,30,Nice Hotel But....,My wife and I were recently guests at the Be live collection Marrakech for 6 nights on our Honeymoon. We did our own research before deciding where to stay and Be live collection seemed to be be just what we were looking for. There are several positive reviews on the web which helped us make our final choice and decision to book with Stay for long holidays.  We arrived at Be live in the evening of 2nd February 2020 and on checking in a sign stated that one of the two pools was closed for maintenance which wasn't a problem. We were shown to our room it was exceptionally clean and we were excited to explore and enjoy our stay celebrating our marriage (we got married on 1st February 2020) We were woken up at 3am unfortunately from noise disturbance from inconsiderate neighbors we could hear everything through the connecting door and it seemed like they were in the room with us. If it became a reoccurring problem we would just ask to move rooms so not much of an issue there. Our first full day started off wonderful the hotel was spotless the gardens well kept breakfast was good and the sun was shining. Perfect! We decided to go for a swim in the pool that looked so inviting I hadn‚Äôt even got all the way down the steps and realized something was SERIOUSLY WRONG I lifted my foot out of the water and blood was pouring from my toe. I looked down into the water while my wife went to seek help and could see several broken tiles. The poolside guys helped with dressing the wound with a bit of cotton wool and some tape. I had cut my toe quiet badley almost down to the bone we went to the reception to see if they had a medical kit but they produce more cotton wool and tape. The pain and discomfort was unbearable and I spent the rest of the hoilday hobbling around the hotel. This ruined our entire stay. My toe is still in a bad way and probably should have had a couple of stitches...in my opinion they closed the wrong pool for maintenance. This should be immediately addressed and no one should be exposed to the risk of such injury.....,Date of stay: February 2020,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Darbs999
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Mia wrote a review Feb 2020,50,Already booking to return,What a wonderful holiday! I can‚Äôt recommend my time here enough. Whilst the hotel is lovely it‚Äôs more of a 4 star! What made the holiday a 5* and so wonderful was the staff hospitality. They could not do enough for you. I would highly recommend booking an experience with Desert Safari Experience. For ¬£70 each we got to experience camel riding and quad biking in the desert with the most wonderful food and entertainment. The price also included a return taxi to the hotel. If you are looking for somewhere clean modern and chilled with good food and a short bus ride into the city this is for you.  A special shout out to Monsef who is part of the animation team wow! He literally made our holiday with his upbeat attitude and kind nature. He entertained us the entire trip and was an absolute pleasure to be around.,Date of stay: February 2020,Trip type: Traveled on business,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MiaGil82

The food & alcohol wasn‚Äôt great - there are a lot of options but it‚Äôs the same food everyday and the quality could be better. There is no food allowed by the pool but there is a poolside bar however again the food was average. The staff work incredibly hard and provide a great service. It was my birthday and they provided balloons a cake and lots of decorations in my bedroom which was a lovely touch. The poolside entertainers were fantastic - we had so much fun taking part in the activities I.e basketball and aqua-aerobics. The room was perfect - great size. There is entertainment in the evening after dinner which is nice. We had a spa morning at the hotel and this was incredible - we had the hot stone massage & Californian. I also really recommend going on the evening excursion to the desert where you can do camel riding/quad biking etc with a Moroccan dinner and entertainment. Fantastic value for money. We had such a great time. You can book this through the hotel.,Date of stay: February 2020,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/762celiad

There's also a reliable shuttle bus service into the city which is free and takes about 20 minutes. The only downside on this visit was someone was trying to get into our room in the night and the reception staff were a bit dismissive with us insisting it was a drunk guest.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,James and Anne wrote a review Jan 2020,40,Be-Live collection hotel Marrakech for 7 nights,The hotel is beautiful the staff the grounds and the food are amazing.    Just a couple of issues to make future visitors aware of:    The hotel is located a good 20 + minutes by free shuttle bus outside the city centre in an area which comprises of mostly open land and a mixture of unfinished buildings and buildings under construction as a result there is nothing to do no where to walk outside the hotel grounds.    The hotel has an excellent spa with great facilities including an indoor heated pool which we were hoping to use as January is chilly here evenings and mornings however it is run by a separate company and the prices which the hotel have no control over are crazy high for example we asked to use the pool and were told it would cost us 150 Dirham or ¬£12 per hour!! We were then advised if we picked a particular program of treatments we would be eligible to use the pool as we wished however the treatments in question were going to cost us a total of 6600 Dirham or ¬£526!!! for the two of us.  Needless to say we gave the spa a miss we felt the staff there were out to make a fast buck with a degree of hard selling tactics.  Come on Be-Live sort this out this Spa does your customers or your reputation no good at all.    Finally hopefully it was just our room but we did note a strong smell of sewage in it at all times it was also noted in the Lobby bar on a couple of occasions only.    In summary if you take the surrounding area and the Spa out of the equation it really is a great place to stay.,Date of stay: January 2020,,Hitchin,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DisappointedHitchin

Plenty to choose from and the bread was freshly made.    We were looked after on an evening by Mourad who kept us topped up with the red wine which was delicious.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Sajjad H wrote a review Jan 2020,50,Amazing!,Stayed here over Jan when the weather is much cooler. Very impressive hotel with amazing staff!    Room looked like it was new. My room had a little seating area outside the back where smokers could sit/ or just bask in the sun if you don‚Äôt smoke!    I personally found the food to be great. I can understand some people saying they didn‚Äôt enjoy the food but the good thing is that there is so much variety and the dishes change daily. There‚Äôs also the outside bar which serves food (albeit at certain times) so there shouldn‚Äôt really be a reason you can‚Äôt find something you don‚Äôt like.    There‚Äôs a shuttle bus which goes to the city centre everyday with three different stops. We found the best approach to have breakfast early morning get the earliest shuttle to town and see the sights whilst the weather is still cold and then come back at around 3ish so we can have lunch and sit in the sun whilst it‚Äôs at its hottest! One thing to improve on is that there should be a map of the stops and it‚Äôs localities given to you. We didn‚Äôt realise there were three different stops and we ended up getting lost on one of the days due to the language barrier between us and the driver of the coach on one of the days - he was really helpful though and drove us himself to where we needed to be.    Loved the Sports bar spent most of my evenings in there playing pool board games and watching football.    There‚Äôs a small shop in the hotel for small things e.g deodorant/cigarettes/snacks/souvenirs which is handy as there is literally nothing else around you other than a car showroom and another 4 star Be Live hotel.    All in all i had a great holiday. The staff are super friendly; I can see where some people have said they are understaffed as I got that feeling too.. but they are really hard workers and you could tell they were going the extra mile to make our holiday great.

The people at the reception were very friendly and explained us everything that we needed to know. Even during our stay they always had an open ear for questions.    The room was very clean. Two big beds and bathroom with a bathtub and an Italian shower. We also had a terrace. Rhe beds were very comfortable.    Since this is an All Inclusive Hotel and only local alcool was served we had a little doubt about the quality. We tried some cocktails and these were amazing. Even the Marrocanian beer was very good.    The food at the hotel is mainly served at the buffet restaurant. The menu changes everyday and there is food for everyone. I think that the quality is very good. You can try the local cuisine. For one evening we could go to their restaurant the ‚ÄòKsar‚Äô where you can choose between two menues. Food and service were amazing.    Free shuttles are offered to the city center. Just ask for your ticket at the reception.    Every evening they have a different event at the lobby bar. The waiters are very friendly and serve you your preferred drink always with a smile.    At the dports bar you can play pool table football several card games etc. The cocktails are bigger here than in the ither bars.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,JumpingJackFlash2017 wrote a review Jan 2020,50,"Fun,fun,fun in the Sun,sun,sun",What a charming Hotel beautifully presented great hospitality what more could you ask for. Thank you Be Live Experience for an exceptional holiday the service from your staff was of a high order and you can feel proud of yourselves for providing such an all round good space to enjoy some much needed winter sun. Although the Hotel itself is a good stones throw from the main hub of Marrakesh the Hotel puts on a Coach shuttle service several times during the day. Within twenty five minutes you will find yourself in the thick of it all from Snake Charmers to the vibrant buzz of the melody of the Medina and the endless amount of Souks dotted around.    Worthy of a mention were the Maintenance team and Groundsmen whose work generally go overlooked. The grounds were always well maintained and the grounds were kept immaculate the Pool was clean and the addition of an outdoor seating area allowed for Al-fresco dining in the Moroccan Sun. You can always count on a Brandy or a tall cold Cocktail to add a laid back feel to eradicate the winter blues.    The front desk staff were generally helpful switched on and on hand to offer suggestions of the local landscape of Marrakesh but in all honesty the stars of the show were all those whom worked in the main eating quarters I cant say enough good things about them. They were always attentive to our party of two addressing us by name for the best part meeting us daily with a warm reception by offering up a smile and general chit chat. Its funny how the smallest seeming things leave a lasting impression nothing ever seemed to be a chore they were practically falling over themselves to help making sure that our meal was satisfactory and topping up our Glasses at the nearest opportunity.    I found the selection of food to be very good and plentiful the Lamb Tagine was delightful cooked to perfection. The generous cuts of meat seemed to just separate from the bone with ease and the Cous-Cous was so light and fluffy compliments to the head Chef keep up the hard work.    Throughout our stay I could sense a good sense of team work it was evident that all the Kitchen staff were well managed and worked cohesively to ensure that we had an enjoyable experience. Although all of Waiters and Waitresses were worthy of commendation I am guilty of having my favourites and would go as far as saying that their work was exemplary. I would like to take this time to thank them all by calling them out individually by name for their hospitality.    A Special thank you to Mouhssine Saad- lets hope Mourinho can turn things around at our beloved Spurs  Abdessamad for always offering up a smile and his tireless work ethic Mourad for his warmth of character and Nayma for making the best Pizzas that side of Morocco.    I know this review is getting lengthy but I cant conclude without mentioning The Hammam and Spa treatment package deal that we purchased. The service was professional and by far the most thorough massage we have ever experienced and we will be looking to return in the not so distant future. I opted for the Hot stone treatment which in hindsight was a great choice and left me feeling rejuvenated and with a sense of well-being. The masseuse had to practically scrape me up off the lino from where I had conked out bringing on relaxation to the point of inducing sleep. This crowned off a pleasant stay at the Hotel making a sweet holiday that little bit sweeter.    P.s : Please be mindful that a deposit of ¬£90 is taken by reception and will be returned on your departure.    In the market space Hagglehagglehaggle and haggle some more at the Souks and don't be afraid to walk away. Be mindful though as the tradesmen can be very pushy just be respectful and if not interested simply walk away.    If you are looking to have a nice night out of the Hotels ground and could use a change of scenery where you can get spruced up for with live music and belly dancing and all the razzmatazz and glitz Marrakesh has to offer get yourselves down to Bendoo Restaurant on a Saturday night its located the other side of Jemaa el-Fnaa not too far from Sofitel Hotel - accessible by getting the shuttle down to the last stop and a 15 minute walk. I would suggest you reserve a table for 9 pm and stay for the entertainment which gets started about 10 pm so be prepared to be leaving the venue no later than 12 am so you'll probably need to arrange a private Cab to get back to the Hotel.,Date of stay: December 2019,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JumpingJackFlash2017

All the animation team made us feel so at home with a huge thank you to Zakaria for being one of the nicest people we have ever met. Always had a smile.!!

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,HRV wrote a review Jan 2020,40,"Fantastic week, few tweaks needed",We have just returned from a wonderful week at Be Live. Would definitely recommend Morocco as a good winter sun destination and the resort was great but there are definitely a few changes that can be made which will only serve to make it even better.    Staff: All staff in the hotel were friendly attentive helpful went out of their way and the animation team in particular were the best we have ever known. A special shout out to Zakaria and Mustafa and everyone was lovely getting people involved in the activities and talking to us almost daily.    Cleanliness: Rooms were spotless each and every day as well as all hotel areas restaurants lobby bar gym spa everywhere. Could not fault at all pool areas and all bathrooms in commons areas were spotless as well as the tables chairs and pool.    Food and drinks: Unfortunately this is one of the areas that needs improvement we found that a lot of the items in the international buffet were cold hit and miss or repetitive. Obviously we understand that its an all inclusive and this will be the case but I think they could do with a re think of a few different cuisines at lunchtimes and dinner times and things need to be properly labelled or sectioned as it was very unclear what was what was decent with eggs bread fruit etc.. The snack bar offered a different lunch option which was welcome as they did burger and chips which we had often. The cocktails depend on who is making them and they could offer more fresh juices but the coffees were lovely and like we said the service was always great.    Rooms: Very large comfortable bed with robes and slippers only issue was we had a connecting room door and unfortunately every single word movement and action could be heard from next door so perhaps better soundproofing would be something for the future.    Entertainment: Again this was hit and miss on the nights where they had two guys singing and playing live it was great however there were some nights were there was no atmosphere at all and the entertainment was so so. Karaoke was fun and when they had the dancers it was fun but from 9pm until the entertainment it was often waiting around for something to happen.  We took advantage of the free shuttle bus to Jmaa El Fna which was a fun day out and a nice thing to easily arrange with the staff.    I would say overall our experience was a joy and I would definitely consider staying at Be Live again.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,kim t wrote a review Jan 2020,50,Perfect short break!!,I booked this four night break as a Xmas pressie for my partner via Voyage Priv√©. We absolutely love it!!! Such an amazing deal.... food is great but remember it‚Äôs buffet style and in any hotel it‚Äôs always pretty much the same every day. We love Moroccan food so we are more than happy but there‚Äôs pizza and pasta if your a creature of habit!!! It‚Äôs a very small resort with nothing outside of it although they offer a courtesy bus to the M√©dina one a la carte which we haven‚Äôt found the need to try and a pool cafe which serves great club sandwiches and burgers. Wine is really nice sadly they water down fruit juice which I find hard to understand when there‚Äôs oranges growing in the resort grounds. Premium spirits chargeable. Haven‚Äôt tried the local beer. The hotel is absolutely spotless and staff couldn‚Äôt be more friendly or helpful... Now the Spa.... OMG best massage I‚Äôve ever had!!! Well worth a visit !! If you are thinking of a January trip here bring jeans/trousers and jumpers. Very cold in morning and early eve the hotel is quite casual ... so don‚Äôt bring anything fancy.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Darren wrote a review Jan 2020,40,"Great food, great restaurant and bar staff, but it is not a 5 star hotel.",We stayed for two weeks over Christmas and New Year.  As seasoned travellers we did not think that this was a 5 star hotel as it did feel a little disorganised and understaffed at times. That said the staff are very friendly and really do transform the place and made it a great place to stay.  The food- Very good indeed. We are both fussy eaters but we always had lots of choice and were always impressed with the standard. We could not make use of the √† la carte restaurant as my fianc√© is a pescatarian and they did not have any fish/vegetarian replacements for the set courses with meat (they could only serve the meat dish without the meat)- this amazed us and was another reason we do not consider the hotel 5 star.  The room- We stayed in a suite and were very happy with it. It did lack some basics like a mirror in the second bathroom and plug sockets for hair dryers etc. in the main bathroom. It was in a good part of the hotel away from the bars and restaurants so nice and quiet.  The snack bar could be an issue at times with queues for drinks and long wait times for food and service. It felt understaffed on both the walk up and sit-down service. The staff that were there worked very hard indeed.  They really do need a coffee machine and toilets at the quiet pool.  The gym- this really could do with expansion and upgrade. We visited at different times of the day and it was always pretty busy and difficult to get on things. It is a gym from a very average hotel!  The friendliness of the bar and restaurant staff really did make this an enjoyable stay. They also did an exceptional job at the New Years Eve gala.,Date of stay: December 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NavigatorDarren

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Dominic C wrote a review Jan 2020,40,Seeing in the new year with Be Live,We stayed with Be Live for a week over the new year period. We visited for some winter sun. This is the colder part of the year with the day being warm between 11am and 6pm outside of these times it was fairly cold. However due to this time being less busy it was calmer and there was no great rush for sunbeds.  Food - The food was mainly a buffet which was good but not the greatest amount of variety. As a food allergy sufferer I would recommend getting translations for your allergy into Arabic and French (the two main languages spoken) prior to travelling. I would also notify the booking agent when booking. At the buffet there was no signage saying which dish contained which allergens. However I found the staff very helpful and they gave you a tour of the buffet saying which dishes you would have to avoid when asked  Guests were entitled to one night at the authentic Moroccan restaurant on site were you chose from one of two fixed menus. This made for a nice change.  Rooms - the rooms were of a good quality clean tidy and a decent size.  Pool and facilities - the gym is adequate for a fairly basic workout. There‚Äôs a number of cardio machines some free weights and a couple of weighted machines. There are two pools on offer (the main pool and a relaxation pool). Both pools are well managed if not a little small.  NYE - A formal gala dinner was hosted for New Year‚Äôs Eve for no additional fee. It was a nice way to chat to other guests. The food was nice and there was live entertainment.,Date of stay: December 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Essex, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dominicc654
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Ellie G wrote a review Jan 2020,30,Moroccan Stay,Myself partner and our friends visited this hotel in Oct 2019. When we first arrived the staff couldn‚Äôt have been more friendly and attentive and offered us some Moroccan tea whilst we waited to check-in. This did take a little longer than expected and we couldn‚Äôt get into our room for a good few hours due to check-in time which cant be helped.    It was scorching hot so we got some food and drinks whilst we waited. The rooms were beautiful and clean however there were a couple of times we went back to the room and they hadn‚Äôt been tended but once we asked there was no issue in arranging this.    The weather stayed hot all week and the pools were great to cool down in!    The food was beautiful lots of choice and delicious local dishes too!    The drinks in the sports bar and the lounge were fab however the drinks around the pool were less so there were lots of bees/wasps around the fizzy drinks often weren‚Äôt enough plastic cups meaning having to wait for them to be insufficiently cleaned.    The grounds were beautiful and the evenings were relaxing. We got the free shuttle into the Medina which i highly recommend it is an amazing eye opening experience!!    Overall I had a fab relaxing time the one and only thing i would say is the pool bars could be improved.

Lots of groups of adults and all age groups of couples. A great mix. Food was very good  always plenty. Snack bar good too. Speciality restaurant was a very lovely experience going from buffet to waiter service and they did it with style food was different it was a matter of taste. Rooms large and always spotless. Pool and bars well kept and staff again very helpful. Spa was amazing value we had treatments split over 3 days  fantastic experience  great treatments and fantastic service.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,M&A Simpson wrote a review Dec 2019,30,Ok- not true all inclusive,Positives-  ‚Ä¢they take pride in their decor and cleanliness of rooms and grounds.  ‚Ä¢The rooms are spacious with air con.  ‚Ä¢sports bar waiter very attentive and friendly.  ‚Ä¢free shuttle bus-although limited times of departure and pick up.    Negatives  ‚Ä¢ when you check in you are required to pay a deposit for the mini bar- which in fact is empty! A fridge in the room with water but nothing else This deposit is then returned to you upon check out apparently however I have only just received the ¬£80 deposit back today 31/12/19    ‚Ä¢the snack bar is time limited in terms of opening hours. Finishes 6pm  ‚Ä¢A particular waiter makes it evident of his distain if you‚Äôre not French or don‚Äôt speak French- came across ignorant.    ‚Ä¢As for food from 10pm you are given an option of a sandwich which is found in the sports bar.    ‚Ä¢Constant smell of sewage coming from our bathroom.    ‚Ä¢ after a week stay the food became a bit samey it looks like there are loads of options but several dishes of roasted vegetables buffs it out.    ‚Ä¢the evening entertainment is rubbish. This place is not catered for the younger population. Although a mixed age group when we visited but definitely more for your over 50s    Conclusion  I wouldn‚Äôt go back. It‚Äôs not all inclusive as you might expect. Snacks are limited drinks are cheap & watered down. Food meh.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,SHOWTRAC wrote a review Dec 2019,40,Nice modern hotel - would visit again,Spent Xmas week here first time been at this hotel. Very quiet when we arrived but filled up over xmas.  Two nice pools one more fun noisy one more chilled and quiter. never once had to get up early for sunbeds always pleanty on offer. nice towels as well.  Rooms - we had a ground floor pool facing very large Super King bed. Good air con. Nice bathroom and powerful hot shower. Good blackout curtains room safe and fridge all handy. We did some mattress manouvering as the bed was just too soft for us and gave us back ache until we made some adjustments.  Food - the food selection in the buffett was awesome. I pretty much ate from teh salad bar each time as it was different every day. There is plenty of hot food and a pasta station as well. Breakfast has an omlette station but get your fried eggs fresh as they get cold when left in the warmer.  The waiters in the restaurant were brilliant and we very soon had our favourites that looked after us and plenty of wine.  Pool side snak bar is also good for food and we ate there on a few lunchtimes.  Evening in the lobby bar once again good service and entertainment though we often went to the sports bar which was also good and has san miguel in botlles.  We never did the ala carte so cannot comment    Overall this was our first trip to Morocco and this hotel was really good. Free shuttle in to Marrakesh regulalrly through out day and evening.    There is nothing outside of this hotel so no shops or places to walk to.    The Adults only does make a difference and we value that .

Firstly the hotel is super clean modern and easy to get around. A truely adult only resort with the options of a quiet pool and fun pool. The fun pool is staffed by an enthusiastic team with regular activities and music. The food options in the buffet are excellent for all meals and we never got bored. The rooms are clean modern and spacious and really comfy beds. On the whole the staff are super friendly and responsive. Also helpful is the hotel runs a free shuttle bus to Marrakech centre which takes 15-20mins which is helpful as it‚Äôs a little way out of town. A taxi is also a good option and costs 100-150Dirhams.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Paige H wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Above and Beyond,Wow... Where do I even begin with this review    Firstly I'd like to say IGNORE the negative comments and reviews on here because after staying here for 10 days we have nothing but amazing things to say about the whole experience from beginning to end.    When we arrived we were welcomed by the friendliest of belboys who immediately assisted and helped take all of our luggage inside we were greeted by the reception staff like family They were so incredibly polite and helped us in every which way they could nothing was too much trouble we had to pay a ¬£90 deposit for the room and towels at check in however if you look after your room and dont lose the towels you get it straight back with no problems on check-out.    The rooms were beautiful I stayed with my Mum and we booked a twin room we wasnt expecting to find to full size double beds and for the room to be so spacious it was immaculate and we were well stocked on teas/coffees bottled water etc. and all the other essential equipment you need we stayed in room 2114 which was perfect for us as it was round the back of the hotel on the 1st floor and our balcony was very secluded and quiet in the evenings I will say the only problem would be the bathroom window adjoined to the room as its see through even with the pull down blind so if you arent with a partner be aware of that to combat this problem me and my mum just put the bed runners up the window and it gave us the privacy we needed so wasnt at all an issue. The housekeeping were absolutely fabulous nothing was too much trouble and each day our room was left pristine so a special thankyou to them.    The Food was absolutely delicious we really couldnt fault it so all of those complaining and wanting your standard english grub book an all inclusive in benidorm if you want you pie and chips that badly! We are vegetarians and there was SO MUCH choice the chefs and dining staff go above and beyond to produce such beautiful spreads Christmas Eve was absolutely divine you could see just how much effort they had gone to for the guests and the chefs all looked as proud as can be when guests began to eat and so they should be we cannot thank you enough the waiting staff were all so friendly and efficient and would be over in a snap to replenish your drinks or clean away your plate once you had finished.    Now coming on to the parts that really made our holiday special firstly were the snack bar team They are some of the nicest warmest friendliest people we have ever come across a huge and very special thankyou to Khamal and Sara you really made our holiday special and we genuinely looked forward to coming down each morning to see and talk to you both I cant sing their praises enough and Belive... they really are a true credit to your team and you should be very proud to have them work for you I really hope you are able to relay this and they get some recognition for that. They would always seem genuinely happy to see us and interested in a chat as well as being beyond efficient in bringing us whatever we needed without even needing to ask we were genuinely sad to say our farewells and to leave them!    My second special mention would be Titif He made us feel like family and we will never be able to express just how much we enjoyed talking with you and how welcome you made us feel he too is an absolute credit to your team and we hope that he gets recognition for that also We also felt very sad saying goodbye to you too!    For those reasons alone and because of your fabulous staff we said that we will be returning to Marrakech Morocco is a beautiful country and we have never been made to feel more welcome anywhere before until we came here and we are very looking forward to coming back to see you all again!    Again such a massive thankyou to all of you that made our holiday so special and we will be back! Anybody that wants a relaxing getaway this is the place for you thankyou so much again.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,iompair wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Ideal for relaxing winter sun,We had originally booked a break to Tunisia but got caught up in the Thomas Cook d√©bacle so booked here on a bit of a whim and are very glad we did.  Rooms are spacious beds comfy and bathrooms have a lovely deep bath and separate walk in shower.  There are 2 good size pools. It's worth being aware that the quiet pool - the one with swim up bar - isn't heated so not really suitable for swimming at this time of year. That said the animation team take their break 12:30-14:00 so the livelier (heated) pool is quiet then and good for swimming. There are plenty of loungers/beds around the pools. No need to get up early to reserve one although that didn't stop some people!  Food is plentiful and varied. One of us is a very fussy eater & has managed to find something at every meal! Excellent cocktails - highly recommended is the Mojith√© a local twist on the classic Mojito.  The resort is kept spotless by hardworking staff who all seem to be smiling whatever the hour!    If you prefer a quiet room ask for block 3. It is further from reception/amenities (walk to the pool takes about 90 seconds so not exactly a long way) but no disturbing music from the lively pool or bars.    This has been exactly what we wanted - a relaxing winter break away from any Christmas stresses.,Date of stay: December 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Isle of Man, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iompair
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Natalie F wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Beautiful Xmas week away,The first thing to say about the hotel is how hard the staff work in all bars restaurants and pools across the site. They are so lovely and polite and definitely add to your holiday. I think a lot of people come time and again as we hear some people that are really familiar with the staff and ask after their families which I think is lovely and really rare these days.    Our room is a swim up room which is great but the swim up doesnt swim anywhere it's just a pool in front of the adjoining rooms.  I dont think weve made the most of it and if we came again we'd probably just get a standard room.    The food is pretty average a usual all inclusive. It can be quite random.  The drinks are great the measures are generous and theres a good selection of cocktails.

If there ever saw an empty glass it was refilled!! the rooms are modern and spacious with super comfortable large beds. Food in the buffet style restaurant was excellent and something different every night. The hotel is slightly out of town but not an issue if you are sitting by the pool. Excellent weather for December grounds immaculately kept. Lots of activities if you want it. Indoor pool gym and spa. Free shuttle bus into the centre of town a bonus. Tui rep that operated from the hotel was very good and knowledgeable gave great tips. Highly recommended and a great price. Would definitely consider going back in the warmer months.

All inclusive so you should never go hungry. Plenty of food and drinks although will give the food an average rating.    There‚Äôs a snack bar available between meals which means you don‚Äôt have to worry about missing breakie or lunch. Snack bar closes at 6pm - just in time for dinner.    You‚Äôll be entitled to ‚ÄúMorrocan fine dining‚Äù (which needs to be prebooked at the reception) at the KStar restaurant if hotel is booked for 4+ nights. There are two menu options which aren‚Äôt very great (but the general buffet is just about a minute away so you can pretty much get some food in the dinning area if not satisfied with the ‚Äúfine dinning‚Äù meal).    Hotel has a gym. Sadly the indoor pool doesn‚Äôt come with the price of the hotel. Also has a sport bar for the sports fanatic. Not a lot of TV channel choices if english is your primary language.

The room was lovely and spacious and had everything you needed. The rooms were cleaned excellently daily. The spa was exceptional. We had a spa package which started with a Hammam.The Hammam treatment was an amazing experience leaving my skin feeling soft and clean. This was followed by a massage which was comforting and relaxing. We were then allowed to relax by the heated pool. T  he pool was warm and clean. The style of the spa was just lovely and was my favourite part. The food at the hotel was ok. There was a good variety of food and many different options. However the food could have been hotter.  We did try to book at La Carte restaurant one night however we didn't enjoy the slow service and ended up eating at the buffet.    Again the staff were very friendly and welcoming.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Richard S wrote a review Dec 2019,50,"Excellent Hotel, great service",Amazing hotel and great staff. If there ever saw an empty glass it was refilled!! the rooms are modern and spacious with super comfortable large beds. Food in the buffet style restaurant was excellent and something different every night. The hotel is slightly out of town but not an issue if you are sitting by the pool. Excellent weather for December grounds immaculately kept. Lots of activities if you want it. Indoor pool gym and spa. Free shuttle bus into the centre of town a bonus. Tui rep that operated from the hotel was very good and knowledgeable gave great tips. Highly recommended and a great price. Would definitely consider going back in the warmer months. Brilliant,Date of stay: December 2019,,"Lowestoft, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardS775

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,peachesandclive wrote a review Nov 2019,50,Lovely holiday with no issues,Just back from 5 days at this hotel.    As you are doing now I read all the reviews and just like me I'm sure you've read the negative ones and have some reservations as a result.    Well I don't know where these people have holidayed before or how high their standards are but for a normal person on a regular holiday I cannot see what there is to complain about.    This was our third consecutive all-inclusive trip to Marrakesh at October half term and it was easily our favourite. Although we liked the other hotels we've stayed in (Aqua Mirage and Eden Andalou) everything here was a bit better and a bit more straightforward than our previous experiences.    The photographs are all accurate - what you see in the photos is exactly what you get. The rooms are really very nice indeed and the grounds are absolutely lovely.    If I wanted to I could find things to nit pick about - but this was not an expensive holiday and we had a very enjoyable relaxing week so why would I?    Traveller tips:  Take a few books and leave them behind in the hotel library  Take some teabags for your bedroom (they provide fruit teas only)  You have to pay a tourist tax in cash; this is normal  Ask the staff for a few words in French and the local arabic dialect. Hello and thank you in the local language are basic courtesies and will go a long way with staff.,Date of stay: October 2019,,NE Hants,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peachesandclive

Food and drinks were spot on. The selection of fresh meats fish fruit and vegetables were varied and delicious. Desserts are amazing. We found all the staff to be polite and helpful. The lady in public relations gave us great advice before taking the free hotel bus to visit the souks and take in the sights of the City. Great bar service from Azdine (Lobby bar) Mochine (Sports bar) and Mohammed on reception was friendly and helpful. The hotel and grounds are spotless. Maids did a fantastic job of keeping our room tidy and making sure we had clean towels water in the fridge etc. We had a swim up room which I would recommend. It is a shallow river but is great for cooling off and relaxing back at your room. Both pools lovely with activities at one and a swim up bar at the other. Evening entertainment was low key but we had plenty of laughs and met other people to chat to. Would choose to visit this hotel again if we return to Marrakech.,Date of stay: October 2019,,Stalybridge Nr Manchester,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cazatinkerbell

The entertainment in the evenings and the activities during the day put on by Titif and his colleagues meant we are never bored or short of things to do. Titif was very good at getting people into the activities and taking part - normally we would never have taken part.    The hotel staff/restaurant staff and pool staff are very friendly and their service is fantastic. Darts in the pool archery table tennis and other fun activities like Aqua Exercise/Aerobics were always entertaining and a good laugh.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z3216BGstuartb

Funny how a smile can be contagious- the amount of people who don‚Äôt say thank you or engage with the staff made me feel really sad as they work so hard.  Cocktails during the day are watered down so we stuck with the stork beer which was good bless Omar on the pool bar having to deal some of the rowdy drunk loud Brits...yes unfortunately there was some Brits abroad behaviour going down... üôà  Evening cocktails were amazing the mojitos in the lobby bar were delicious and the bartenders were super and kept the drinks coming. Thanks guys ‚ù§Ô∏è    +Entertainment  We enjoyed the Latin show DJ and the band. To be honest it was better than I expected. I was so underwhelmed by the Sports Bar because there are so many reviews id liken to a man cave/youth club.

The hotel has a gym spa etc so it‚Äôs based on the amenities. Could service be quicker? Yes.  Could the food in the restaurant be hotter yes!  Could there be more plastic cups?

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Cerrileigh wrote a review Oct 2019,30,Nowhere near a 5 star hotel.,Hotel was set out nice and very pretty. However food in buffet bar was average at best the A La Carte food gave us all food poisoning and flies around all drinks/snack bars.  A lot of staff are very unhelpful and very rude there is no where near enough staff to cover the amount of people in the hotel. We was waiting 25 minutes for a drink with our meal having to clear tables to sit down at and asking 3 times for knifes and forks to eat a meal with.  Rooms was nice and clean however our shower leaked every time we used it which flooded the whole bathroom floor and had to ring the maids to come and clean it up everyday.  The ATM in reception took the money out of our account but did not give us the cash. When we asked reception for help they said they knew about the problem as it had happened a few times before but did not give any guidance about how to get the money back or fix the problem.  Multiple tiles was missing from the bottom of the pool and pool area which made it uncomfortable to stand on and cutting my partners foot.  After all entertainment shut at around 10:30/11 every night the sports bar around the corner was supposed to be open while 1am the hotel manager asked everyone to leave every night at around 11:30/12pm meaning we was forced to go to our rooms at that time.  All the bars and food bars had flies around and the cups that you receive your drink/cocktail in was always really dirty.  The hotel is nice and okay for the price we paid for it however it is no where near a 5 star hotel.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cerrileigh

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,adrianHeswall_Wirral wrote a review Oct 2019,10,A Shocking Experience,As you can see from my profile I use TripAdvisor to allow people to find good hotels/restaurants/experiences. I'm not here to criticise for the sake of it and recognise that on any given day somebody can have a bad day so please understand that for me to write this review must reflect something seriously poor.    I have NEVER had such a shocking hotel experience in my life as I had here last week. It is difficult to know where to start but we were on an all-inclusive package. Check-in was early and a ¬£10 deposit was taken for pool towel card but we were not allowed into room until 4pm. Luckily we went off to play golf so it was not an issue for us.    Rooms were actually quite comfortable but the fridge was empty - no water soft drinks or snacks etc etc even though on an all-inclusive package and it was 38 degrees C outside!!!!    Dining was poor. Took ages for them to get a table of 8 together every night buffet food was poor quality lukewarm at times and little in the way of choice. The local (free) wine was paint stripper-like and vile. There were options to buy European wines but only with cash no credit cards and no room charging - how ridiculous.    Bar was understaffed so poor slow service. No wonder they were so rude and stressed. People waiting ages for drinks. Tonic flat ice from who knows where and the beer was room temperature (hot). Not enough glasses - even got told to find some glasses on vacated tables if I wanted the round of drinks that I ordered - what the hell was that all about?? No evidence of a proper steam cleaner for glasses commonly found in any European establishment.    Is it any wonder that half our group fell prey to the dreaded gastroenteritis!!!!!!!!    And the final coup de grace - be very careful during check out. Do NOT hand in your pool cards with the credit card used as a deposit when you check out. Do it earlier on a separate occasion and here is why. Once the front desk had my card I was then accused of stealing a Be Live tea mug as it was missing from my room. It was 5.45am in the morning and they claimed that somebody had already been in my room to do an inventory check. Why on earth would I steal a tea mug!!!!!!!!! Cost me ¬£5 to get my credit card back - a total scam amongst the check in and housekeeping staff.    DO NOT GO TO THIS HOTEL IT IS A DISGRACE. I look forward to hearing what the hotel manager has to say about it,Date of stay: October 2019,,"Heswall, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adrianHeswall_Wirral

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,amefit247 wrote a review Oct 2019,40,"Small, relaxing hotel",We have just spent a week here and had a very chilled time.    The hotel is small and clean with two pools - one with music and one without. We opted to relax by the quiet pool which also has a swim up bar.    We went to the gym most days - this was adequate. There is basic equipment CV equipment and free weights. It got very hot in there mostly because the air conditioning was never switched on and even when we'd turn it on the staff would leave the external door open which let in the heat. This made training hard work especially as the CV equipment is against the glass in the sun.    The food here was very good. I am vegetarian and there was a good selection of salads and vegetables as well as lots of morrocan cuisine. There was always lots of fresh fruit and the desert selection was great.    The service in the hotel was a little patchy. There were a number of people who we felt worked extra hard at looking after us; Omar at the pool bar Sara at the snack bar Ussama and El Bachim in the restaurant and Azdine was fantastic on table drinks service. We did feel that on occasion it would have helped if they'd had more staff on but generally speaking we were well looked after.    The room was very nice and kept clean however our tea coffee and water were very rarely topped up. Most days I had to go and find a cleaning trolley and help myself.    The hotel could be amazing we just felt that the areas outlined let the place down a little. That said I think that we would return for a chill winter sun break.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amefit247

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Lucy3ee wrote a review Oct 2019,50,A fabulous stay - realistic UK traveller review,I visited this hotel with my partner and we had a great holiday.  Arrival was smooth we booked private transfers from the airport and arrived within 30 mins. We were checked in but told our room would not be ready until 3pm. We were very tired so went back to the desk at around 2pm and asked if early check in to room was possible which the staff happily obliged to do.  Our room was perfect. We had an extremely quiet room facing away from the pool area in block 2 (room 2015). Our terrace was not overlooked and we were facing the sunrise every morning which meant that the room remained very cool as the sun went the other side of the hotel. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was very spacious and suitable for a couple. Be aware that if you book a superior room and you are travelling as friends there is a pane of glass that you can see straight through (even with the blind down) that goes from the bedroom to the bathroom this is fine for a couple but there is no bathroom privacy if you are sharing this room. However the toilet area is separate from this. The air conditioning in the room was amazing and a god send for the weather we were having (40-42degrees C everyday).  We had maid service everyday and tipped between 20-40MAD a day to our maid. Other people in the hotel explained that they were not tipping but this is a custom I like to dabble in as I know the standard of pay is not great for this type of job plus the room was cleaned immaculately as were all the surrounding areas in the hotel. There is a fridge in the room that has water in and you can pay for it to be a stocked mini bar although we did not do this. There is a lot of wardrobe space but not many hangers in the rooms. We had a seating area with a chair and table and was lovely for when having downtime in the room before dinner.  The grounds themselves are beautiful. The gardens are tended to and they are so well looked after. The pool areas are really lovely there is an animation pool and a more relaxing pool with the swim up bar. Our room was close to the one with the bar which we were grateful for as we aren‚Äôt the animation pool/music blaring/aqua aerobics type of couple but it was great for some. We enjoyed the pool area and the pool bar was great. The drinks aren‚Äôt very strong when served but if you ask for extra spirit in your drink the staff are happy to oblige. There are plenty of sun-beds for everyone but people got out early to put their towels on the bed of their choice so we did the same thing as we liked the double Balinese style beds with the table in the middle of them. Handy if you want to stay in the shade like I did because they are covered well.  There are plenty of options for food. Breakfast was plentiful and there was so much choice at every meal. But if you didn‚Äôt make breakfast before 10am you can eat late breakfast at the snack bar by the animation pool. This was limited but kept you going until lunch. The only problems with the food in the buffet restaurant was that it wasn‚Äôt always as hot as you‚Äôd like. The food was beautiful and I‚Äôm such a fan of the local cuisine in Morocco but there is choices for everyone even a fussy eater would find something here. We were in the a‚Äôla carte restaurant on one night and the food was all local cuisine. If you are a fussy eater you don‚Äôt want to go here. It‚Äôs included in your all inclusive stay but my advice would be to avoid if you don‚Äôt like the local cooking as you have a choice of 2 menus and they are rather similar in style but with different meat or fish on menu. I thought it was lovely but my other half was not full up by the limited amount on his plate and wanted to go to the buffet restaurant afterwards. The a‚Äôla carte restaurant was also uncomfortably hot to sit in the night we went they have air conditioning throughout the hotel but don‚Äôt always see fit to have it on. It made me feel like the experience in that restaurant was tainted by this but otherwise it was fab and the staff were so attentive. If you are peckish in the bars you can ask for nuts to nibble on with your drinks. There is no where to get food between 12pm-1pm which I found bizarre for all inclusive but wasn‚Äôt a problem.  The evening entertainment is not something I can comment on. I know some people have said it‚Äôs not great but I thought it was fine. It‚Äôs subtle and I guess some people are just after more when it comes to night time entertainment but we weren‚Äôt there for the entertainment so it didn‚Äôt bother us. If you like some big tacky show every night while you‚Äôre on holiday then this place probably isn‚Äôt for you. They had singers and keyboard playing and then a fire show one evening but if anything else was going on we were not made aware and we wouldn‚Äôt have gone anyway.  We considered going to the town to see the markets and hustle and bustle of Marrakesh but we didn‚Äôt go in the end. A lot of people were mentioning how they had gone and not enjoyed it due to the local ways and so we decided against it. However if you do want to get out of the hotel and see the local area the hotel run a shuttle bus to the town for free. You just book at reception for the time you want to go and then be picked up. We wanted crisps and little snacks for our room and the hotel shop did not sell what I wanted so we ventured out of the hotel once down the road to the little service station opposite the bmw garage (10 min walk). They had more selection of snacks at half the price of hotel shop. Remember there is a fridge in your room to keep chocolate or cans of drink in too so this was handy.  We visited the spa and had massages on two days but I will write a separate review for this as it was just so lovely.  Overall this was a lovely relaxing place to stay. Immaculately clean and the staff are very friendly and accommodating. We are already considering going back next year!,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hereford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lucy3ee

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,globalconnexion wrote a review Oct 2019,30,5 star setting but 3 star quality,The hotel:  The setting of the hotel is beautiful it's well landscaped and feels like a retreat oasis. The rooms are spacious clean and well-appointed those facing away from the pools are quieter with adequate facilities provided in all the rooms. One of the two pools attracted a younger crowd with loud music and other activities going on. The other pool was quiet and relaxing and it was usually easy to get a sunbed. Glad we didn't go for a swim-up room as you couldn't swim up to it you could paddle at the most. They also lacked privacy as you could easily encroach onto the outside space of the neighbouring room with no screening provided in some cases so you could just be sitting out in the open with your neighbour by your side. Balcony rooms were more private.    Entertainment:  The evening entertainment was fine different acts on each night the karaoke nights are best avoided. There was a very good band who played on a couple of nights the lead singer was particularly impressive. The acts are on weekly so if you're there more than a week you‚Äôll see the same acts twice.    Food/restaurants:  The food wasn't great it lacked variety and for a country with many spices the taste was pretty bland. If you like seafood it might be better to stick to that the meat variety was poor desserts were just okay. The √† la carte restaurant is best avoided as food quality was worse than the buffet restaurant many people including ourselves left before completing the 3 courses.    Staff:  Restaurant staff were very inattentive in general you could be sitting for a while before they even notice you they took forever to clear the tables and you could die of thirst before they bring you any drinks. The restaurant managers walked around uninterestingly whilst you wait for the staff attention or sat at a dirty table waiting for them to clear so that you can eat something. A couple of nights the drinks came so late after we‚Äôve eaten and when we tried taking them with us to the lobby bar we were stopped.    Reception spa and bar staff were more attentive reception staff were friendlier but a special mention to Azdine from the Lobby Bar who exceptionally stood out since he worked very hard getting everyone's drink all night and was very responsive not to mention having to remember long lists of drinks.    Clientele:  The clientele is not your average 5-star holidaymakers it seems to attract a broad range people including those you might expect to see in places like Benidorm. There was a particular incident with a group of rowdy people who for a couple days were very loud at one of the pools and caused other people to be upset. One of those rowdy people actually jumped over the bar to serve himself as he thought they weren't being served quick enough but they were drinking quicker than the bar man could keep up. The group also included two older women who insisted on being topless at the pool all day and tried to draw attention to themselves all the time by being loud and uncouth. They went a bit quiet afterwards so it can only be expected that they were warned. Some people were even smoking in the restaurant including a couple sitting very close to us who decided to both light up after having had their dinner which we found bizarre as they were Europeans and indoor smoking is banned in virtual every EU country. They were never asked to stop by the staff.    Marrakesh:  The city is not very tourist friendly but there are pockets of decent tourist attractions it is fairly dirty in the souks and other markets. Locals in the city are generally unfriendly unless they can get some money out of you you even have to ask for permission to take photos which you will be expected to pay for. A shopkeeper virtually abused us for taking photos of the outside of his shop shouting that we need his permission. It was a foolish move as we were actually going to buy from the shop so it put us off.    There is a place called the artisanal market which sells really good quality things you should go there for shopping as prices are fixed and very reasonable. You are likely to be ripped-off elsewhere as we were. We bought an item from the souk which we saw at the artisanal market for less than half the price we paid and this was even after haggling it down. A lot of places in the town don‚Äôt serve alcohol crossing the busy streets can be a challenge there's motorcycles everywhere even on narrow streets in the souks. We enjoyed a very nice camel ride with a nice bunch of locals including having traditional mint tea and cakes in a tent.    To sum it up we don‚Äôt regret the holiday and it was fine for what it was but we will certainly not go back to Marrakesh.,Date of stay: September 2019,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/globalconnexion

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,LordRupert wrote a review Oct 2019,40,Flawed but recommended,Hotel - It is situated on the outskirts of Marrakech (approximately 15 mins drive) in an area that is clearly marked for further development. You can see the mountains in the distance but effectively it is surrounded by scrub land. I ran regularly in this scrub land without issue but I did see stray dogs often. There are security guards at key points and the rear of the hotel is surrounded by fencing and landscaping. The grounds are immaculate and very clean - they are a nice place to be in. The hotel design is functional and it is on two levels with a central reception area. The key thing for me is how clean it was. The rooms are immaculate and the bathroom and bedroom are pleasant places to be. The beds and bed linen are excellent. Think hard about the swim up rooms - they're not especially private and I don't think they provide the bangs per buck you'd hope. I'm very pleased we didn't get one.  Staff - French is the business language here and it is true to say that staff respond best to it. That said I found the staff to be pleasant and friendly. I don't have anything negative to say. I enjoyed using my basic French skills. Cleaning staff were excellent. Waiting staff were always willing to help but I felt that there weren't enough of them.  Food - serving area is not big enough but food is very well presented. This is not for you if you like beige food or struggle with foreign food. I loved the tagines salads octopus and squid. Moroccan wine and beer was a pleasant surprise.  Pool - there are 2 pools: quiet (with a swim up bar) and the one near the activities. Both are in good condition and I regularly saw them tested / sampled. They're both cleaned in the evening. The swim up bar is only really good for cooling down. The nosiy pool accommodates the water polo and water aerobics.  Misc - the gym is good but is not air conditioned. I was impressed with the spa facilities - had a really good massage. Use the coach to go into Marrakech - I've fallen in love with the place. Take the 1535 bus - you see it in the day and night and the sunset is stunning. You'll need to pay a visitor tax on arrival at the hotel and a deposit for the pool towels (they're good quality). Sports bar is a good place to watch football - it isn't conducive to a group social though and the atmosphere is a bit odd. There are plenty of sun beds and I wasn't conscious of the usual problems.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Basingstoke, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Winch2231
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Jia17 wrote a review Oct 2019,50,One of the best in Marrakech,We just came back after a wonderful time at Marrakech Be Live Collection. The best thing about the hotel is the staff and their hospitality. We were looked after very well by Abdes Samad at Breakfast and lunch. He made sure we were comfortable and served well. A Wonderful host! Raja and Hassan at the buffet hotel were also amazing servers. Younnes at the bar was very nice. Made sure all drinks were to perfection especially my sugar free morroccon tea.  The food was amazing wih good blend of moroccon and continental varieties. It wasnt repetitive at all. The evening entertainment was great especially the belly dance show although it was very short and would be nice to have it slightly longer.  The room was very comfortable we had the double superior with garden view. Rooms were cleaned daily. The thing missing from our room was the lack of bath robes. Also the towels were a bit worn out and need replacing.  The free shuttle bus to town was very handy and the driver was very friendly.  The pool was great but they would benefit from having a jacuzzi aswell.  Overall it is a great all inclusive hotel and we throughly enjoyed our stay.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jia1784

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Sophie M wrote a review Oct 2019,40,Holiday,The hotel is beautiful and very clean.  The food is good but a lot of it isn't labelled so anyone with dietary requirements/restrictions/allergies be careful. Staff also can't answer what the food is if you ask them if it has meat etc in it.  The entertainment is good and reception staff are very friendly.  The other staff barely smile or look enthusiastic but this is no issue for us we just accept it and remain polite ourselves but wouldn't be likely to tip the service. I remember 3 members of bar/restaurant staff that were happy and smiling throughout the stay.  Unfortunately the staff do have a hard job though there isn't enough staff so they're probably fed up and overworked.    There is city tax to pay to stay but it isn't a lot at all travel/tour operators don't warn you of this and they do put a holding charge/refundable deposit on your card for the towels etc but apparently this gets removed and un-blocked from your card which is unfortunately still showing on mine as ¬£84 ... So be warned incase this is not given back.  The food was good there was a selection of Moroccan food to try and was tasty fish seafood sushi and a little English food the rooms are immaculately clean the showers work great overall it's a good stay and worth the money spent!

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Toni C wrote a review Oct 2019,40,"Good hotel, lacks in a few areas",The hotel is beautiful in terms of presentation. Immaculately clean. Good facilities.  We had a swim up room and although its shallow it was a nice extra and definitely helped you cool down in the heat.  The entertainment is good.  The sports bar is a nice and they take sports requests.  The all inclusive buffet is what you would usually expect repetitive but adequate. The service in here is slow and it's difficult to get a drink.  The snack bar is better value its included and has a menu with different choices which are all cooked fresh.  Bedrooms although pretty lack basic items such as coffee and tea making facilities and an iron which you would expect in a 5 star hotel. We requested tea bags and milk from the maids daily.  The safe is free and easy to use.  Your room is only cleaned if you display a notice on your door.  Requests for fresh towels took too long as we were informed you needed to display a sign to get your room cleaned upon check in.  They take a ¬£100 deposit upon check in which you get back. They are very precious about their pool towels though and if you dont hand in either 2 towels or towel cards when you check out you will be charged.  The general service was slow throughout the hotel but I dont know if that's just in Marrakech itself as no one seems to be in a rush.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/304tonic
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Joanne H wrote a review Oct 2019,30,Lovely but NOT a 5*,Don‚Äôt get me wrong this IS a lovely place but it‚Äôs not a 5 star more like a high 3 or 4 star. We had a ‚Äòswim up‚Äô room which is deceiving as it‚Äôs not a swim up. What you do have is a small narrow and shallow section of pool that runs the length of the block of each 9 ground floor apartments with your sun loungers partially submerged in the edge off your patio area. It‚Äôs too small to swim in and even if you could there is nowhere to swim to! However it‚Äôs lovely to have this semi private space just outside your room and is great for cooling off when the temperatures soar. The rooms are beautiful spacious well appointed and clean. The all inclusive options are limited to the buffet for breakfast from 7-10am lunch 1-3pm then dinner from 7-9pm. There is a reasonable selection to choose from something to suit everyone but it‚Äôs typical all inclusive nothing spectacular. There is a snack bar at the larger pool but the snacks are very limited and pretty dire. The on-site supermarket can‚Äôt really be called so. It‚Äôs one little room selling gifts and very basic supplies. No drinks alcohol or even ice creams available. The staff are helpful enough but not many crack a smile or attempt to make any conversation. The lobby bar is open all day until late and serve a selection of cocktails beer and coffee. Olives and nuts are available on request but they don‚Äôt offer or advertise this. The sports bar is quite disappointing and has a rather ‚Äòyouth club‚Äô feel to it. There is a mini bar in your room which you can pay to have stocked from 190 DHS for 4 beers. My advice is pop to the pool bar and take drinks back to your room which most people seem to do. All in all a nice quiet place for a sunny relaxing holiday just don‚Äôt expect too much.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Penarth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joannehD6408QK

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,natalies8191 wrote a review Sep 2019,40,Beautiful hotel ... slightly let down by drinks service,The hotel is exactly as shown on the pictures beautifully decorated and all the areas and rooms are spotlessly clean staff are always seen round the clock keeping the hotel looking well! 2 great pools one quiet and one with entertainment. Sports bar is great showed English football games and a nice change to play pool and games if you don‚Äôt fancy the entertainment! Mochine in the sports bar very lovely and provides table service for drinks if he‚Äôs not too busy. Food was great a bit repetitive but very nice... maybe would be good in the future to have some themed food nights to change it up a bit?    All staff very friendly but also quite laidback which we loved... helpful if needed but were not in your face to join in games etc. Pool towels were nice and clean and get fresh ones everyday until you leave. Reception will change English sterling into dirhams if needed which is very easy & we paid 90 sterling for deposit and 38 sterling for tax for 7 nights 2 people.    Only downside would be the drinks service in the day time particularly at the snack bar ... at times the bar ran out of cups which caused a wait to be served which isn‚Äôt ideal in 40degree heat! Poor bar staff had to rush round to collect and wash them so would be good to get some more stock in to prevent this.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,ma77hill wrote a review Sep 2019,30,Beautiful resort poor service,We have just spent a week at your resort and would like to share our experience.    Firstly the resort is beautiful with very modern rooms two big swimming pools sports bar with board games and a pool table and a cocktail bar. I have to say every aspect of the resort was perfectly clean and the maids were attentive.    The food for an all inclusive resort was of a good standard however very repetitive. The snack bar offered an al a carte menu offering late breakfast pizza burgers and salads all with table service. I don‚Äôt feel the food was to a 5 star standard however was perfectly fine for a week.    The service was extremely average the staff levels were severely lacking and there appeared to be no leadership across the resort. The manager spent his entire time stood at the door welcoming guests but didn‚Äôt manage his staff. The restaurant tables were rarely laid up with enough cutlery or glasses you had to chase waiters around to get a drink with your meal and on several occasions wait whilst they collected empty glasses/cutlery to be washed before you could have a drink or a spoon for your ice cream!!! Whilst everyone expects buffet style dinning I think it would be more appropriate to show guest to their table take their drink orders then direct them to the buffet.    The bars again lack staff on average you could wait between 5-20 minutes to be served at peak times and again on occasions would be told to wait whilst they waited for the glasses to washed.    You clearly do not have the staff to offer table service or drink demands so why not invest in self service areas around the pool and in the restaurant. This would take a lot of pressure off the staff and cut down waiting times for frustrated guests who expect a great service giving your claimed 5 star rating.    The quiet swimming pool was complete with a bar accessibly from the pool which was very well received. This however would only be restocked in the morning meaning all the drinks were often warm! Not again something you‚Äôd expect from a 5 star resort!!!    On the day of check out we were offered to pay to enjoy a late check out the night before. We spoke with different members of reception all of which told us different information and prices! When it came to paying we were quoted 600 MAD to check out of our room at 6pm. However at 3pm we were told the late check out was only until 2pm and we had to leave! Others experienced the same so it would appear a scam between the staff to make money on the side with no clear hotel policy of late check out times or prices.    All in all the resort has fantastic potential but requires a manager to complete some basic staff training and over sea the basics.,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ma77hill

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Dean R wrote a review Sep 2019,20,Not a 5* hotel,Firstly I would like to explain why this hotel is not a 5* hotel.  1) The service is generally poor and not attentive for example at breakfast you need to ask for a drink and if you are lucky you may get a smile. Bowls and glasses are at a shortage which for a self claimed 5* resort is shocking.  2) When you enter the Buffet restaurant as with all 5* hotels you would expect to be taken to a free table? Well not here you need to walk around the restaurant and find one yourself. Then wait and wait and wait to ask a waiter/ress for a drink.  3) No glasses at the snack bar usually in the afternoon. They can't cope with the washing up.  4) No mini bar in the room. You will also be informed it is forbidden to take drinks in your room?  5) The breakfast is OK pretty standard. Lunch is the best meal of the day in the Buffet restaurant. Dinner is poor very very poor. Unless you eat pasta and pizza your choice is limited. The morrocan selection is poor. The food is warm at best. The pasta is the best option but I didn't come to Morroco to eat pasta.  If you have food allergies or like me can't eat bread you will be struggling to eat. No food allergy advise on any food and cross contamination on many food types.  The snack bar is OK again if you want to eat pizza and burgers and fries. I don't travel to 5* resorts and want this I expect more. The salads are limited and don't expect to eat one past 16.00 as you be told they are not available?  The Ksar restaurant is not too bad. You can have one reservation per stay if you stop over 4 nights.  I am not just moaning on but the service and food is that of a 3* hotel at best.  The positives are:  The rooms are really nice and spotless beds are large and very comfy. We stopped in 4004 ground floor next to the snack bar. The swim up rooms are more of a selling gimic. You can't swim up you could however walk up to your room in water?  The bus to the city is useful and free. We used this twice. A little tip. Go in the morning if you want to shop. Hardly anyone bothers you. Go at night to experience the hustle and bustle.  The pools and pool staff are good staff are very friendly.  Grounds are kept nice and clean.  The coffee is good as is the Morrocan tea.  There is now where to have a nice afternoon coffee and cake or light snack.  I have travelled all over the world and have been lucky to stay in some top hotels. I stay away a lot with work so I am used to the hotel life.  My wife and I have had a relaxing time away from our children for a week. I wouldn't return back to this hotel or even Morroco. It was an experience but not one I will be having again.  One last thing the evening entertainment was at best average. After a week with most hotel entertainment you loose the will to live.  Go to Turkey for 5* service fresh food and culture.

Very nice touch.  - The hotel is very clean this cannot be faulted.  - Staff are nice enough  - The shuttle is handy but drops you in quite a random place    The bad:  - The sport bar. From reviews I was excited to see this. However it is nothing to what you would expect. When we first walked in we had to wait for 'Mohcine' to serve us because he was over seeing some other guests write a review on tripadvisor for him! ( now I realize why everyone only writes a review for the sports bar). Then when he made the drinks there were no hello or conversation made. We never went to the sports bar again after this.  - The buffet restaurant the food was never warm. I am not fussy with food so this wasn't much of problem for me.  - There isn't enough outside seating for everyone to watch the entertainment. But logistically the hotel wouldn't be able to fit anymore seats out there anyway.  - The cleaners sometimes didn't clean our room till around 4pm (but did a great job).  - If you have a room near the pool music is extremely loud from 9am-7pm and you can hear the entertainment on an evening until 12pm.    Even with its downfalls I still think its a great hotel and would recommend to people staying in Marrakesh.,Date of stay: September 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/parkinsonolivia1

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,antb1976 wrote a review Sep 2019,30,Very average and I definitely wouldn‚Äôt call it 5*,Upon arrival we were greeted nicely at the door after arriving from the centre of Marrakech where we had a great time and brilliant service from Riad Dar One (look them up as their Riad is amazing)    Unfortunately I had left my rucksack in the Riad and quickly realised I‚Äôd also left my passport in the bag. Now I know that it was my error but rather than checking us in and waiting for our passports to arrive they insisted that I needed pictures of the passport and the special number when arriving into Marrakech airport. This took about an hour after a really long day this could have been avoided by just letting us check-in however the hotel manager said that this wasn‚Äôt possible. The guys at Dar one kindly drove the bag up to the hotel the next day that‚Äôs real service.    So the hotel is really nice and the room was far from a disappointment we had a superior swim up room which was spacious very clean and the sunbathing area was spot on. I‚Äôm not sure about the swim up part as it was more of a relaxing area I jokingly tried to swim in it and the bruises i sustained will be with me for sometime üòÇ what I found odd was that the mini bar was only stocked with a bottle of water I later found out that to have drinks in there you had to pay extra......I decided that walking to the bar was the better option.....mmmmmmm    So amazing looking hotel and room was spot on we truly had been spoilt.    HOWEVER    the service was atrocious trying to get a drink at any of the bars took too long and if you were lucky you received a slightly cold drink in a not very clean plastic cup....I stuck to beer out of the bottle which on the first day they ran out at the pool bar. Dinner that same evening was ok the food is average for what is supposed to be 5* i was hoping for amazing local food and instead we got very average European food. During the evening meal I decided to have a glass of red it took and age to arrive and then when I asked for another I was told they had ran out and that I had to go and get one from another bar. I spoke to the restaurant manager who in return told me to sit down and he would sort it out....he did.    I have many scenarios where service was bad but I think you will get the idea. I did speak to customer relations about it and things seemed to improve I must say that the girls on the desk were VERY helpful and understanding. Also I must say that all their staff were very good the simple thing is that there wasn‚Äôt enough of them this resulted in a disappointing 1* service.    I won‚Äôt even start on the evening entertainment which was shocking and more like for a hotel smack bang in the centre of Benidorm 5* hotels are supposed to be a bit more classy than karaoke 80‚Äôs disco and a very poor pub singer on an electronic keyboard.    Overall I would give it a 3* which would have been higher if service levels were much higher.    Come on Be Live you have to realised that your customers work hard to pay to come to your resorts and these are holidays that they wait in anticipation for some time to receive service like this is nothing but disappointing.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Ro W wrote a review Sep 2019,10,Don‚Äôt come or waste your money,We‚Äôve been here since Friday and I can honestly say it the worst holiday experience we‚Äôve had. May be it‚Äôs because we have been spoilt in the past but this place is just appalling in terms of service.    On the bright side the room is spacious and clean which is a positive and the housekeeping staff do a good job.    However the services available are very limited. In an all inclusive resort it is disappointing to see that there is not stocked mini bar even just soft drinks!    Four times we‚Äôve asked for our fridge to be looked at and it‚Äôs still not working properly. We‚Äôve been out and for our own soft drinks off site to stock it.They only came to look at the fridge today (day 4) after we asked to see the manager!    The pool bar is a disaster. Hardy anything is on top including soft drinks and it‚Äôs an effort to try and get some of the staff to serve you. Depends on how many French people are at the bar and how much the bar staff want to pull themselves away from engaging them in conversation.    Nothing is chilled the bar is in not in good working order and they ran out of beer at 12:30 this afternoon ( I don‚Äôt drink it but those that did did not look impressed!).    There aren‚Äôt enough glasses to go round which then has an impact on the available bar staff and at several points yesterday the bar was unmanned for 30+ minutes whilst the single member of staff had to Cole‚Äôs the glasses and do several stock runs! The cleanliness of glasses is a lot to be desired as I‚Äôve just taken a sip of wine (with ice which is just outrageously) and it tastes of Pernod as the glasses have not been clearly washed properly ü§¢. Who doesn‚Äôt like the take of wine and Pernod in one go!    In terms of food very hit and miss. Buffet food is luke warm to say the least and I would have some serious concerns in light of that around it‚Äôs hygiene status. Again staff seem so busy but that‚Äôs because they are unable to cope with the demand. This is impacting on the overall level of customer service.    We‚Äôve paid for swim up which is clearly over priced as it‚Äôs about the same width and depth as our neighbours pond. Now I know I‚Äôm a big girl but Jesus even a carp would struggle!    If the management team are reading this come and se me I‚Äôm in room 2001 and more than happy to have a the conversation now rather than later today (23/09/19) when we return to our room.    If I had any advice don‚Äôt come!,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosewF1682LB

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,andrewrcoulson wrote a review Sep 2019,30,Great hotel. Average service,The hotel is really modern and clean so I couldn't fault how the place looks. However when it comes to the service improvements need to be made. The staff are extremely friendly but on a few occasions have either forgotten or mixed up and order not cleaned the room or not replaced the towels after taking the old ones. Also on a number of occasions we would wait at the bar and notice many other people get served before us who arrived after us.    The food is okay but there isn't a huge selection. It seems a lot is a repeat from night to night. It wouldn't of been as bad if we were there only a few days but we had a couple of weeks.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,golfgoddess123 wrote a review Sep 2019,40,"Comfortable rooms, nice stay","Staff were generally very helpful especially the maitre d' who went out of his way to ensure one of the ladies in our party had a very special big birthday celebration. Rooms were a good size and the beds were REALLY comfortable. Spotlessly clean. Buffet food was plentiful and with a good variety. House rose wine was lovely but spirits and the mixers were disappointing. Can recommend the virgin mojito without sugar though!  The hotel has 2 pools - one with music aerobics table tennis etc and one as a quiet area. During our stay there were 2 ladies by the ""quiet"" pool who were thoroughly obnoxious and an absolute disgrace. The management tried very hard to subdue them but a firmer stance would have been more appropriate including calling in the police. At the very least the hotel should review its clothing policy and introduce a ban on topless bathing.  The bar staff worked really hard but could have done with a few more pairs of hands.  There is an a la carte restaurant where you can eat once if you stay more than 4 nights. Limited choice of menu but very accommodating and nice traditional food.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,tanja646 wrote a review Sep 2019,10,Don‚Äôt trust them- awful end to our holiday!,I was looking forward to writing this review as we had a lovely holiday but on checkout it was completely ruined. We left being shouted at by terrible reception staff who were incompetent rude and unhelpful.    On arrival we were not talked through the information about the hotel instead they took a deposit on card and sent us to the room. We needed WiFi so later came down where a different member of staff spoke us through the hotel information and told us to collect towel cards the next morning. We came down the next morning where we were asked to pay a deposit for the towels 200MAD each which we paid in cash. On our final evening we paid a city tax and were told we would receive both the deposit and towel deposit back when we checkout the next day. Upon checkout we received the card deposit back but were refused the towel deposit being returned because they had not given us a receipt for paying cash.    At this point we were informed that the towel deposit was included in the initial deposit paid. This was not told to us and they proceeded to take cash for the towels even though we had paid the deposit by card. They claimed to check the CCTV and then claimed they could not see a pass over of cash- either they have not checked or they are just stealing our money. Both options are unacceptable.    The management have managed this very poorly most of all Abdellah who was most unhelpful and would not pass us any management contact. This is the second lot of poor management we observed- a racist drunk man was behaving inappropriately at the pool and it was other holiday makers who had to step in rather than their own staff.  I‚Äôm not going to mention any positives because our experience was ruined. We will be recommending everyone to not come here.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Billy A wrote a review Sep 2019,10,Be live Marrakech,Unfortunately I cannot leave a good review after our experience this evening. Food has not be very good in the restaurant this week with lack of choice. This evening my partner decided that she would like to take a few snacks back to our room for later on nothing major only we were stopped at the restaurant door and embarrassed by a very rude employee in a suit who very aggressively and rudely told us it was forbidden to take food out of the restaurant. We have stayed in many hotels around the world and I have never been spoken to so in such a disgusting way by a member of staff. Unfortunately it only takes 1 experience like this to ruin a good week. My suggestion is to take some advice from staff from a Riu hotel they will teach you how to treat guests !!,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/664billya

Don't get me wrong staff are lovely friendly helpful facilities clean but when you pay 5 star you should get exceptional service ( and we have stayed in a a few 5 stars). Tea bags were never replenished in our room they took our room towels one day and never replaced so only had robes to dry on. The glasses around the pool are only cleared at the end of the day 6pm i feel there is not enough staff around the pool to give the 5 star treatment. The pool towels REALLY smell of sweat where they probably need replacing. On a positive there are no kids (wahoo) the buffet is out of this world so fresh and really good options for vegetarians. But i really think it should be 4 star rating or even 3 star. The spa and indoor pool you have to pay on top of the all inclusive.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Adam Q wrote a review Aug 2019,30,Nice Hotel but service was lacklustre,Hotel was lovely and couldn't knock the rooms (we had a swim up room) and the surrounding pool/restaurant areas but was let down severely by the service offered by the bar staff and restaurant staff in general. Numerous occasions the bar ran out of beer or ran out of specific drinks and we waited nearly 15 minutes every morning just to get someone to acknowledge we wanted coffee. There was a few exceptions the guys in the lobby bar were very efficient and for some reason the service at dinner was unbelievable but apart from this we were not best pleased and neither were most of the people we spoke to. If this hotel decided to invest in training their staff in being more efficient and friendly then we would really consider going back in the future.    On a positive note I enjoyed the games around the activity pool and also liked the two different settings of a pool bar which was quieter and had the bar attached and the activity pool with constant games and party atmosphere around.    Would like to suggest s toilet near the quiet pool though as we constantly had to go back to our room as there was only a toilet at the activity pool.    Overall we didnt really let issues with service bother us and we still had a nice time just was a bit of a dampener overall.

Very friendly and helpful they even attempted to teach us Arabic.  Shout out to Kerim Titif Fahd and Fatima - thanks to all of you for making our holiday so much fun.  Meal times is the main down side. The food is ok it could be labelled better as someone with a good allergy this could be difficult at times but there is a reasonable choice. The management need to invest in more plates and cutlery and glasses throughout the hotel as often we were waiting for these things to be cleaned. The staff tried incredibly hard to serve us well but at one point I ordered 3 drinks and the girl behind the bar had to go collect glasses so she could compete my order.  On an evening there is entertainment on each night we however decided to go to the sports bar where there is a pool table table football and various other games such as poker and dominoes as well as showing live sports on the tv. Mohccine is the bar tender there and he is brilliant. He has his own special cocktail and will make you just about anything you like!  There is a shuttle bus from the hotel into Marrakech you just book it the day before just be aware of people trying to make you hold monkeys and stuff in the square because once you‚Äôve touched it you have to hold them!,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Worksop, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaC00k

The rooms are lovely and modern and the beds are amazing. However there are many many downsides to the hotel. Didn‚Äôt get checked in until after 3pm as we were still waiting for the room to be cleaned. Very limited choice of food in the restaurant and forever waiting for cutlery bowls etc. Drinks were watered down or full of sugar. Service was the worst I have ever known had better service in a 3*. We seemed like an inconvenience when asking for anything even when asking for a drink at the bar. The worst part was the airport shuttle. We booked this days in advance to be told the morning of our departure it had not been booked. After waiting for 40 minutes a taxi finally arrived. Told us the price had increased but we paid it to ensure we made our flight!

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,530Amanda wrote a review Aug 2019,10,Appalling,Worst hotel I have ever stayed in! Pros : hotel itself is lovely and modern fab AC in rooms. No sun bed race on a morning. Cons : room wasn‚Äôt ready until 3pm queuing for a bottle of water in 40 degree heat which was NEVER cold always lukewarm. Restaurant was a joke very limited selection with cold food. Fried eggs burnt on the bottom raw on the top scrambled egg so cold I felt I could‚Äôve made an egg mayo sandwich. No brown bread only white which tasted sweet even when toasted. Had to ask for spoons bowls and milk for cereal. Full fat milk no skimmed or semi skimmed. Staff very rude making you feel like such an inconvenience. Had to hunt for salt and pepper which 9/10 were empty anyway. We got to the point of dreading meal times. Every single time in the sports bar we felt an inconvenience to the Batman as we kept interrupting his game of pool so we could get a drink (cheap copies of spirits or warm bottles of beer)! At one point he had ran out of glasses so we were being served cocktails in a plastic beaker you got round the pool. Pool area does not get cleaned I was cleaning my side table myself and couldn‚Äôt put my bag on the floor as it was filthy. Never once seen the pool get cleaned or water checked.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Thomas O wrote a review Aug 2019,40,"Great holiday, staff where brilliant",Just recently came back from a week stay here and we had such a great relaxing time.    The hotel is spotless i couldn't fault the cleaners at all and the pool toilets where also immaculate. The room we had was just a standard room but it was a great size and the air con system worked a dream.The food choice was okay in the main restaurants with different types of meats and fish been put on every night and they had several Morocco dishes which was expected. if you like your salads they had a huge choice which was nice. The pool snack bar was a really nice touch also with burgers pizzas sandwiches and salads all on offer.    My only cons for this hotel was the amount of staff they had on at the bars at times with a waiting time to get served just over 5 minutes which the staff did there best to get to you as soon as they could.Also the amount of bees at the pool bars at times which was annoying at times.    The staff at this hotel where great and pleasant but would just like to say a huge thank you to Adbel and moschine which worked on the pool bar and sports bar and also would like to thank Abdess who worked in the restaurant. All 3 made the holiday extra special. Also a massive thank you to the cleaners who work very hard everyday to make it so clean defiantly the cleanest hotel i have ever stayed in.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,miss P wrote a review Aug 2019,40,Honest review- nice hotel but definitely not 5*,Just returned from a 3 night stay at Be Live and thought I would write a quick review as I find reviews very useful in making decisions about where to stay...    Pros-    The rooms are very nice and clean and as the other reviews state the bed is very comfy! The swim up room is definitely worth the extra money and gets sun in the afternoon which is perfect.  The swim up bar pool is lovely and always easy to find a lounger.  Spa- we had a massage which works out as a pound a minute- quite expensive to be honest but it was very good and relaxing. As other reviews stated we were prepared for the hard sell of numerous spa packages and just pushed back. The lady on the spa reception was very welcoming and friendly.    Cons-    Staff could be more helpful and also the transport arranged by staff is very over priced. We used a car arranged by reception to go into town the guy didn‚Äôt have change so we overpaid he gave us his number and said he would collect us in a few hours but didn‚Äôt answer any of our calls or texts until hours later. Also after checking in early we were given no info about suitcase storage toilets towels etc. which is ridiculous for a 5 star hotel- you just have to work things out for yourself.  Food is not labelled well at all as all of the reviews state so not too sure why they do not sort an easy fix. Very unclear what is vegetarian/vegan- just need clearer labels. Also food is often not hot but cold or warm and they need more waiters to serve drinks. There should be a self-serve drinks machine as standard for 5 star hotels as the staff are rushed off their feet and take forever to serve even a water. They also get the drinks orders wrong so you have to start again after waiting- again really poor for a 5 star hotel.    Drinks- service at the bars is slow and no smiles. The drinks are typically watered down/just full of sugar. Also endless plastic straws- please say no as they automatically put one in every drink.  Deposit- we read about this beforehand so brought cash which made it a lot easier to get the money back at the end- highly recommend doing this to avoid card complications and them not paying the money back. For 2 people and 2 towels it came to ¬£90.    Overall very beautiful hotel and swim up room is worth it but they desperately need more staff and the food drinks and service could be improved. Also just to note- If you go into the souks in town please do not go near the monkeys or snakes- tourists taking pics with chained up monkeys is vile.,Date of stay: August 2019,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/592rrr
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,TravellerAbi93 wrote a review Aug 2019,50,Wonderful stay,Overall this is a lovely hotel. Most staff are very pleasant and helpful. The room is amazingly spotless and comes with all the extras even a mini sewing kit. The air-conditioning in the room was a life saver. Shower is very good and again bathroom is spotless. The housekeeping team work very hard. FYI the towels are kept on a shelf above the bath! We didn't realise when we checked in late at night but the housekeeping team were happy to bring us towels when requested. Water bottle replenished daily in the room. We had a room near the noisier pool which wasn't a problem during the day as we went to the quiet pool or out for the day time. It's a better location for the evening as the entertainment runs until midnight which is very very loud not our cup of tea but manageable and understandable.  The quiet pool is lovely and peaceful the swim up bar is an added bit of luxury although mind the step walking back through the pool or you'll end up with the drink in the pool lol. We didn't go to the noisier pool as not our thing but the people there looked to be enjoying themselves.  The food selection was great plenty to choose from and try on each day. The puddings were amazing. However the buffet bar is not staffed well enough. The waiters and waitresses are rushing around everywhere and you have to wait ages for your drink to arrive which nearly always arrived after we finished our meal. The hotel needs more staff here definitely as the experience each time was not 5 * service.  The spa is incredible! Me and my husband had a package 1 hour hamman treatment in a couple room which was an experience! Followed by 30 min massage of your choice and then a 30 min full body massage. Incredible... I even fell asleep and snored according to my husband lol.  Check in was relatively straight forward. When we arrived the buffet was closing in 20 mins so the staff invited us to enjoy before check in and guarded our luggage which was very lovely of them. There is a deposit you have to pay for the room and extra for a pool towel card. We opted to not pay for the towels as we had our own and it was around ¬£53. This was a little silly as on check out they didn't even check our room before processing the refund of the deposit.  The shuttle bus into Marrakech is reliable and we used it to travel in but got a taxi back as the travel times back are far apart.  Overall a really pleasant stay for our mini moon break away at an affordable price.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Amandajc75 wrote a review Aug 2019,30,Mixed feelings about this hotel,"We have just returned from the Be Live hotel in Marrakech. In some aspects the hotel would get a 5/5 - cleanliness staff food - amazing!! However some basic fundamental that are missing - lack of spoons and glasses...seriously what is that all about? Surely you would think a 5* hotel would have enough spoons and glasses for its customers. The queues at the main bar in the evening... one person behind the bar working his socks off and just getting on with it - you just know that if it was not an ""all inclusive"" hotel and people were paying for drinks there would be at least 3 or 4 people there to serve in excess of 100 people (possibly more) who populate the area in the evening. We had a swim up room which was beautiful and we loved even with the stench coming out from the shower which is obviously some form of drainage fault this didn't overly bother us (you just need to shut the shower door to contain it) as the room was amazing! Finally the nightlife - or lack of it - I know this is an adult only hotel but not everyone is in couples and even if you were the continual old love songs ""lady in red / Just the two of us"" played on the keyboard are just too much and it just created an overall lack of atmosphere at the hotel which could have brought so much to it in terms of customer experience. As the week went on we just started to dread the evening entertainment and in the end avoided it - not ideal for a holiday experience.",Date of stay: August 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amandajc75

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,reviewer of luxury wrote a review Aug 2019,40,A lovely stay!,Second visit to marrakech within 1 month. This was more of a adult holiday for a short break so we chose the Be live collection adults only. Stayed in a pool view room which was clean and mainly facing the garden which did work out well because the live entertainment carried on till quite late by the pool and was quite loud. So we were a little distance away.    There are 2 pools one which offered entertainment and the other was more the quiet pool. We enjoyed our time at the quiet pool that is what we had come for!    We had 3 rooms booked for the stay and Mohammed on reception was very helpful in trying to move us around so all the rooms were near to each other -very accommodating.    The all inclusive option is mainly the buffet. There is also a morrocan restaurant onsite but it is an additional cost if you stay less than 4 days. There is also the option of a snack bar by the pool. I have done a few all inclusive adult resorts and I was a little surprised with the limited meal options. But for our short stay it was sufficient.    I had read a few reviews before leaving about the service by the pool being very good. We had none - no one came and asked us for any drinks by the pool. We had to go to the bar everytime. The service was not to expectation after all that I had read.    With the all inclusive drinks menu they mainly offer the local brands. Most cocktails come out of a machine so they are too sweet and you cant even taste the alcohol. Local liquor rather than branded spirits.    Overall a lovely short stay but quite a basic all inclusive option for an adults only 5* resort.,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reviewer-of-luxury

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,KateRussell1410 wrote a review Aug 2019,40,"Nice hotel, some quirks",Just got back from 8 days at BeLive Collection Marrakech. Overall lovely and relaxing holiday some of the reviews on here make things sound quite bad - they're not but there are a couple of quirks at the hotel!    We stayed in a suite room was lovely - great bed shower was good nice to have a bit of extra space and a balcony. Room was kept very clean by the hotel staff (as were all the premises). It is a lovely looking hotel grounds and gardens are beautiful didn't use the spa in the end but had a tour and that looked great bars nicely decorated and well kept pools were great and there's lots going on around the hotel. Bus that goes into Marrakech is very useful you have to book it through reception and it only leaves at certain times but it's a really good facility to be able to experience Marrakech itself.    If you're in a bedroom in the centre of the hotel (overlooking the area outside the dining room) be aware it will be noisy at night. This is the area where the entertainment takes place of an evening and from the noise levels the band may as well have been in our bedroom! Tended to be finished by midnight but if early nights and peace and quiet is your thing then ask for a room at the end of the hotel and front facing. We overlooked the pool where activities took place so it was quite noisy during the day too - not a huge problem as we tended to be at the quieter pool so that was fine but again take it into consideration if you'd like a quieter holiday. In fairness when we spoke to reception they did offer us another room to move to but I couldn't be bothered with the hassle of repacking and moving so we stayed put and just adapted our days around the noise.    Food could do with being a bit hotter the buffet is lukewarm at nearly every meal. Everything has been properly cooked I think it's a struggle they have because of the ambient temperature being so hot. Hotel badly needs to invest in more glassware! There's never enough for you to have the drink you order in the glass it should be served in (not a huge problem obviously but quite strange when you're handed rum and coke in a wine glass). The service in the bars and buffet could be better - this is not the staffs fault they're running around all over the place just think there needs to be more staff in these areas. As long as you're quite chilled and don't mind waiting for things it's not a problem.    The a la carte restaurant isn't really a la carte there's only 2 set menu options both traditional Moroccan meals. We had a lovely evening there the food was absolutely beautiful and the service was great - if trying some local cuisine is your thing then definitely go here (if you're more a pizza and chips person then probably don't bother).    Having seen other reviews I was quite nervous before we went - on the whole absolutely no reason to be! The biggest things people seem to worry about in reviews is that the tea and coffee facilities in the rooms don't come with milk - if you ask at the Snack Bar they will give you a small cup of milk to take to your room and that you have to pay a deposit on arrival. This is for towels and the condition the room is left in - can't speak about how easily the money comes back as we only checked out yesterday so not sure yet.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Daveyoung29 wrote a review Aug 2019,50,Relaxing holiday,The hotel is fantastic. Has everything you need. We stayed for 12 days which was more then enough. The buffet needs a bit of an upgrade for the type of food but you can always get something. The lads that worked behind the bars are all fantastic especially mohcine who was atvthe pool bar and then the sports bar. Such friendly staff. There arnt enough bar men on at times you can be waiting 5 minutes for a drink. Lack of glasses at all bars. A few times I got beer in cocktail glasses. Dirty glasses coming back to the bar just washed out with a bit of water and given to the next person. Don't see the why the hotel cant have enough glasses. The rooms were very clean and a different design on your bed when you get back from the pool. A bit silly that you need to put a deposit off ‚Ç¨100 down for pool towels for your stay. Got the money back when we left.Was a fantastic holiday all round will definitely be back,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daveyoung29
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,JOMO1 wrote a review Aug 2019,50,Superb holiday destination and fabulous hotel,Lovely reception area and a nice welcome from a traditional Berber gentleman offering mint tea. All communal spaces are lovely and clean and nicely presented. Beautiful spacious well appointed rooms and bathrooms. Fabulous friendly hard working staff. Lovely food with a big selection including fish and seafood steak and every other type of meat local specialities pizza pasta salads and desserts. Great regular shuttle bus into town. There are two large pools one sporty and lively and the other lovely and quiet (rowdy people will be asked to use the other pool by the pool attendant). The gardens are gorgeous and very well kept. Drinks and cocktails are lovely (as someone has complained yes they‚Äôre diluted at the pool but probably for safety reasons and you can always have the wine (lovely rose!) bottled beer (San Miguel or local Stork) or perhaps go to Benidorm instead!!!!!). There is nightly entertainment which is great but it could be a bit quieter for those who aren‚Äôt interested in it or even moved a little further away from the rooms perhaps. The hotel offers great disabled access with lifts and ramps wherever necessary.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Rory M wrote a review Jul 2019,50,Great resort to enjoy Marrakesh,We enjoyed 7 days here; fully satisfied the whole time.    The room was really nice larger than we expected and great bathroom - balcony always a good extra for a cigar and a late night drink (and drying towels/trunks). A few nice touches like the maids making up the bed in various designs each day were a welcome surprise.    The pools were great plenty of beds so you‚Äôre not crammed in with everyone (even at busy times) pool bar a nice novelty. Theres activities if you fancy it the staff made you aware of them but were happy to take no for an answer which is perfect. There‚Äôs plenty of stuff to do if you fancy it. Some of the music was a bit of a weird choice but I‚Äôm confident they‚Äôd change it if you spoke to them and it really bothered you    The staff were great throughout the hotel everyone was happy & helpful from the guy who checked us out at 6am to the waiting staff in the restaurant (Mourad - top man had our drinks sussed out by day 2 and kept them coming before we even sat down every day). The gentleman in the Lobby bar in the evening is also great (never got his name).    Food did get a bit familiar in the buffet but I‚Äôm not the most adventurous eater so not the best to comment on that really. I was still full after every meal and the snack bar does pizzas/burgers etc if you don‚Äôt fancy buffet.    The entertainment I mean some of it wasn‚Äôt for me some of it I really enjoyed - if you‚Äôve been to these places you know what it‚Äôs like.. it‚Äôs the same with every all inclusive I‚Äôve ever been to. The important thing is the drinks were kept flowing throughout all of it üòÇ    We went down into Marrakesh on the shuttle no dramas just booked it and that was that (although you‚Äôre met with people desperate to show you around - they will leave you alone if you make it clear you want to do your own thing. Nothing to do with the hotel just a tip). Also the time we were down there was a bit long between shuttles back so we had to get a cab but none of the cab drivers knew where the hotel was üòÇ. Luckily (for us) our driver figured it out by asking around all the cab stands he wasn‚Äôt going to charge us for that but we gave him a ‚Ç¨5 tip for his extra work & he couldn‚Äôt believe it. Something we noticed about Moroccan culture is most people are very friendly and really keen to help if they can. Great people.    We did 2 excursions which can be found/arranged in the lobby both went really smooth and were well organised. Really fun and I‚Äôd say fairly reasonably priced considering transport is included.    All in all we had a fantastic week we had plenty of rest and relaxation but equally it felt like we took advantage of most things the hotel has on offer and weren‚Äôt disappointed by any of it. The ‚ÄúAdults Only‚Äù element really distinguishes the dynamic of the hotel from others we‚Äôve been to I‚Äôm not anti-kids but I can‚Äôt deny it is nice to not have any about (especially the time of year we went).,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Southwark, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoryM352
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Florence B wrote a review Jul 2019,50,Lovely,Lovely hotel! And fantastic spa very relaxing great massages would highly recommend the hammam. The rooms were spacious and comfy the beds were amazing and the rooms so clean! The buffet was always fully stocked and with so many choices and all the food so delicious. The waiters in the buffet brought our drinks very quickly and were very kind to us. We went to the quieter pool with the swim up bar as the other pool can get loud and there were lots of people smoking around us. There was always a guy near the quieter pool to help move or put up umbrellas and always plenty of seats even if you came at 1pm. Service was slightly slow at the snack bar but only if you were rude as long as you are polite and nice then you‚Äôll have great service.,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/florenceb894
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Kellyzxcvbnm wrote a review Jul 2019,50,Strawberry Mojito,A beautiful resort stunning rooms and wonderful hospitality.  Having read some of the other reviews I can concur that service is very slow... if you‚Äôre referring to the fact that your drink is on the table within about 30 seconds of the waiter spotting you! Sometimes even less.    Azdine the bartender at the Lobby Bar who we considered to be the mascot of Be Live can not be faulted. The most charming smiley and helpful person. This gentleman most certainty deserves a raise. I have never seen someone run with glasses on a tray without dropping a single one; only at the lobby bar. The strawberry mojito is a must!    The rooms are very clean spacious and modern. I will be sad to leave our beloved bed... unbelievably comfortable...must find out where they get their pillows from.  Pools and outdoor spaces are kept very clean and you can get fresh pool towels everyday. We mainly used the relaxation pool which is the quieter of the two pools perfect for a leisurely dip and some reading not to mention with a swim up bar. The other pool has plenty of activities including water polo aqua aerobics and mojito parties. They even do archery no don‚Äôt be silly that‚Äôs not in the pool.    The restaurant is open most of the day and in the few hours they‚Äôre getting ready for change over there is the snack bar that serves food. Plenty of traditional Moroccan food to try; beef tajine couscous Moroccan soup and more. You‚Äôve also got your classics; pizza chips and chicken burgers. I also noticed that the chef catered for a couple with some more specific dietary needs.    Extras... must not forget the extras. Free shuttle from the hotel into the M√©dina and New Town. In the hotel there are DJ/Karaoke/Dancers/Professional singers on every night. And then there is the spa... a little pocket of heaven hidden in marrakech who knew. As soon as we walked in we felt relaxed and welcomed. We couldn‚Äôt help buy a few massage treatments a Hammam and Full body massage for both of us 1200MAD equivalent to ¬£100. (¬£100 for BOTH yes you heard right 4 treatments for ¬£100) this also included full use of the spa pool steam and sauna. There is also a gym in there somewhere but to be honest who is going to the gym on holiday!

The room was comfortable and quiet and maid service was good.  Overall the food was good a little more choice would be better especially at lunchtime offering cold meets/ cheeses to go with salads.  Shortage of wine glasses in the bar but Azdine went out of his way to always find one for me.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Hellyb123red wrote a review Jul 2019,50,Bliss,Shortly before the start of our holiday I became concerned that the majority of 5* reviews on TripAdvisor were from people who had only ever posted one review and were potentially fake or linked to the hotel in some way. (It later transpired that the fabulous entertainment team where great at asking for reviews and many of the guests agreed to create an account and leave a review there was no pressure but you could tell they were proud of the hotel and wanted potential guests to know)    I was very relieved when we arrived we were greeted at our taxi and at the reception desk by very welcoming staff.    The reception was clean and modern. Arrived at 11am and had to wait until 3pm to check in which was to be expected but we had full access to pool food and bar.    The rooms were great clean in good repair modern and large. My mum is disabled and though given a disabled room it didn‚Äôt meet her requirements - a quick remark to reception and her room was changed straight away with no quibble. The rooms had a fridge and tea making facilities. Bath and shower. Though if you are travelling as friends be warned you can see each other shower!    The rooms with their own pool looked lovely. Worth the extra cost for a treat. Though they aren‚Äôt private and you‚Äôll get to know your neighbour well.    It was Mum‚Äôs birthday when away. They noticed by date on passport and made her feel very special. I won‚Äôt say what they did as don‚Äôt want to ruin surprise for others!    The two pools were fantastic. One was tranquil and relaxing with the swim up bar. The other was fun noisy and full of life...you pick how you want to spend your day. The enclosed sun beds looked great but looking closer they are a little tired and the mattresses are stained. Not appealing. The tiled area around the pool is so slippery - go careful my dad took a tumble. Poolside toilets were immaculate.    Lots of fun activities - aqua aerobics archery Arabic lessons bowls volleyball darts golf etc again up to you if you want to join in. The entertainment team worked hard.    Husband and father both enjoyed using the gym though it wasn‚Äôt air conditioned.    The food was delicious so much choice mostly all healthy. I ate a lot but gained no weight as it was all fresh meats salads and vegetables though pasta and pizza available and lots of naughty pudding choices. Not much variety and no themed food nights but you won‚Äôt starve...waiting staff very attentive and Moroccan wine is actually very nice!    The Moroccan restaurant was a nice treat far too much food but lovely. Though most of the food can be eaten in main restaurant. Shame you can only go once.    Snack bar offered burgers chips and sandwiches which were also tasty.    They had themed nights some of which were odd. ‚ÄòWhite night‚Äô (where you were meant to wear white clothes no one did) ‚Äòkaraoke night‚Äô ‚Äòoriental night‚Äô - expected East Asian food (none served) so not sure what the theme was.    Lots of drinks on the menu they will make pretty much anything you ask for if they have the ingredients. Azdine was particularly fantastic great at remembering what we liked to drink and so smiley and warm.    The bar is lovely and evening entertainment is mainly classy and not intrusive or over the top. Live background music or lounge singers.    Sports bar was more like a youth club but good for a late drink and some pool.    Money exchange at the reception desk was a great rate.    The shuttle bus is a large air con coach it‚Äôs free and very handy! 20 mins to town.    I dropped my nail polish and the glass cracked and cut my hand badly the bright pink polish went on the two small hand towels. I confessed my accident and offered to pay for replacement towels. They were cheap white old towels that would cost no more than ¬£5 to replace but they tried to charge me ¬£20 a towel and comprised on ¬£10 a towel. It was an accident but it was a little disappointing they tried to make me pay ¬£40!    There is a hotel nurse who cleaned my wound at no cost.    ¬£100 cash given to reception on arrival as a deposit and the same money was returned - but make sure you have cash to avoid a card transaction fee.    A few extra staff to reduce wait at bar and maybe offer poolside drinks service...that would make it bliss!

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,bethandboo wrote a review Jul 2019,40,Not a 5* but lovely holiday,Just came back from 5 nights away here.  First of all staff and hotel are lovely very friendly and the hotel is always being cleaned and grounds being looked after.  Rooms are amazing beds are massive and cleaners come in every day and seemed very friendly.  Entertainment in the day is good always fun stuff to do we loved archery aqua gym and water polo. Having yoga at 5pm when it‚Äôs 40 degrees outside is not ideal though should be in the morning.  Entertainment in the evening some evenings are good with shows on other evenings not so great just singers or a dj.  Drink - beer is San Miguel in bottles or stork (there own beer) other alcohol is definitely watered down but just ask for double measures and you‚Äôll get more drunk then.  Pools - lovely always sun loungers so no need to get up early. Having the quiet pool with a pool bar probably not the best idea though. (You get told to go to the loud pool if your making to much noise in the quiet pool by the way)  Food - Buffet is okay not that much variety however I always found something to eat and if not there is a pasta station. Snack bar for lunch is okay but not the best food. Al a carte is the worst I‚Äôve ever been too yes it‚Äôs Moroccan cuisine and I did eat most of it but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend bothering to go it‚Äôs not a proper al a carte.

The hotel is nearly perfect a few things to work on but not the end of the world    The pool team were great especially Karim and titif they managed to keep the place smiling the whole time.    The bar pool is headed up by Mochine and he is brilliant he really made you feel special and was always on the ball with your drinks and with food.    The most important comment of mine is about someone I am sure Is forgotten a lot. The barman in the sports bar who works alone in there made the holiday even more special he would make you come back to the hotel just because of his service.    The rooms are very clean and the maids always leave a different shape on the sheets which is fab.    It is a 20 minute cab in to Marrakesh city centre and the hotel staff will  Help you get a cab    The few negatives    Service at bars can be slow as there is probably not enough staff at these bars but once again the staff do there best    There was sometimes not enough glasses at night but just keep hold of yours and take it back to the bar yourself    I have seen a lot of people moaning about staff being rude on trip advisors my advice is be nice to the staff and say thank you as that can help and they are just people trying to do there job!

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Get_away_fr0m_it_all wrote a review Jul 2019,30,Definitely not 5 star,Firstly this is a very nice hotel with lovely well kept gardens very nice bedrooms and amenities and some excellent service staff. However it is hugely let down in a few key areas.  Unnecessary Amministrative processes  Check is in a long drawn out process. The towel deposit system is crazy as is the system for getting and returning the towels. We went to the spa and asked for the charge to be put on our room but they wouldn't do it as they said the spa was separate (and made me walk back to the room to get money before they would start the treatment) this also happened in the shops which means having to carry cash or cards- not ideal for a pool holiday.  Bars  This has been stated in many reviews but the hotel seem to be doing nothing about the fact that the bars are understaffed. There is only ever one person on the pool bar and he frequently runs out of glasses which makes the wait times even longer. One afternoon I went to the swim up bar I counted 11 people ahead of me to be served so decided to walk up to the snack bar same thing here a huge queue waiting for food and drinks. On the way back I noticed that the lounge bar was empty so nipped in there to ask for a bottle of water and despite there being nobody in the lounge other than the waiter and myself he refused to serve me because I had a bikini on and the lounge policy is you must be wearing a top- crazy!  In another bizarre incident we had finished dinner and were going to walk across to the lounge to listen to the music. When we tried to leave the restaurant carrying our drinks (rather than leaving them and reordering in the lounge) A member of staff refused to let me out of the restaurant carrying my glass as it belonged to the restaurant and not the lounge bar because they were slightly different shapes. When I said I thought that was crazy and was a waste of a drink and of the waiters time in the lounge he got very angry and shouted ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt disrespect our restaurant!‚Äô I hardly think that taking a different shaped glass 5 ft across the corridor into the hotels own lounge bar is disrespecting anyone!  This hotel could be 5 star with better management and processes. They really should consider that most 5 star customers aren‚Äôt bothered about stealing towels or wine glasses or running off without paying for their massages so perhaps instead of having unnecessary administrative hoops for clients to jump through they should concentrate more on customer service and encouraging guests to enjoy their time spent at the hotel with more staff on areas that matter,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Newport, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Get_away_fr0m_it_all
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,emilligan5 wrote a review Jul 2019,40,"A good trip, but not 5*",We stayed here for 4 nights and that was about right length of stay the hotel grounds are well looked after and clean it was a nice short break within a short distance of visiting the city    Positives:  Free shuttle bus into the centre was really good with 2 stops one near the gardens and one near the M√©dina. Guest relations were very helpful at helping us plan a route to see what we wanted to see  The sports bar - really liked this place and was good fun with good drinks  There is a split of a ‚Äòquiet pool‚Äô and a fun pool which was nice but I think with the pool bar in the ‚Äòquiet pool‚Äô they‚Äôve got it the wrong way round  The lobby bar staff were lovely and made great drinks  Plenty of sun loungers and comfortable sun beds    Improvements:  They need to label their food for allergens (being gluten free this would have been very helpful and more options would have been nice too!) and have a better selection especially for vegetarians  The pool bar - needs more staff service was really slow and they need more cups constantly running out. They also need to sort the wasp problem at one point there were wasps trapped inside a syrup bottle. üò©    Would recommend for a short stay at the right price,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bedford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emilligan5
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,jamie s wrote a review Jul 2019,10,Never Again,Me and my wife stayed here for a week. We have stayed in many 5 star hotels and always been impressed with food and drink on offer.    Bad points  The food in buffet area was awfulnot a great choice cold and undercooked meats I.e pink chicken.  The a la carte is the worst a la carte with have been In only about 10 people eating and we noticed that nearly everyone was sending full plates back. The fish soup was disgusting the mains tasted like they had been cooked in diesel. We left before desert was served and we were not the only ones.  The snack bar is an absolute hygiene nightmare. When I ordered a beer the waiter picked a glass off the bar were all dirty plastic glasses were left supposedly ready to clean. Oh no he just poured my beer straight into a dirty glass which some one had obviously already had drank from. Then when I said I wasn't drinking out of that because it was dirty he took it off Me swilled a cocktail plastic cup in water underneath bar and put my beer in cocktail glass( like a martini glass shape) not what you want your beer in. I then decided to give that a miss. My Mrs got her cocktail in a paper coffee cup 1 day as they had run out of plastic ones. This happened everyday and not just with us. The hotel was quiet as well as not full to capacity.  I used the gym to be fair it wasn't bad but I wanted a water which was availbe but just placed in a basket and no fridge so red hot water for all gym users and to be honest which ever bar you wanted bottled water from it was always warm as they did not put enough in fridge.  The bar staff were ignorant and rude except for Mochine and whatever the man's name was who work at lobby bar in night and would bring drinks to table( always smiling)  The drinks were not named but we knew this and unfortunately horrible in taste I.e gin vodka.  Good points  The weather  The room  The beer( from lobby bar out of a proper glass)  3 entertainment staff  Leaving to come Home!!!    Sorry but trust me  this is not 5 star nor 4 nor 3 . It may look good on the eye( I fell for the looks) but regards to food drink and service I can only give 2 star at a massive push. Actually 1.5...    Oh and swim up bar... What a waste of time that is. So depressing no atmosphere over there and staff don't want to be there .  My biggest advice to English tourists is stay away at all costs even if this hotel is cheap. It's cheap for a reason !!!!!,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,wirral,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamies100

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Aliiise wrote a review Jul 2019,40,A place to relax and be in calm.,Great place to relax and do nothing! Spend your days beside the pool and drink light cocktails - run away from busy life and just do nothing. Service and staff very nice and friendly always smiley and welcoming. Food was amazing good mix of Moroccan and Italian I would say... or just European but we did have some sushi as well... so very good mix of everything!!! Loved it! Great to experience the Moroccan restaurant that was available for bookings. If you spent at least 4 days in the hotel you could book 1 evening. They had 2 menus of 3 course meals and both of them where lovely and rich of flavour. Good thing - they had a lot of simile food in the main dining room as well... so 1 evening is restaurant is completely enough. The only lacking point I felt was the beverages in the bar area. Of course alcohol. I‚Äôm fine it's the local alcohol and I never wanted to buy any extra or a better brand. But For a 5 star hotel I was imagining the cocktails to be more creative and more exciting. There where 4 bars (lobby bar snack bar pool bar and sports bar) - all was almost the same and felt a little lacking.  Our room was fantastic and lovely room was cleaned every day I loved how the lady every day made a different ornament on the bed - a bow or wrapped it differently. Lovely.  We spent there 7 days. It was nice and relaxing but sometimes i found it a little boring. Entertainment in the evenings where relaxing and calm as for me I some nights needed some disco or party as I was away with my husband with no kids üòÇ,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Irthlingborough, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aliiise

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,British Reviewer wrote a review Jul 2019,10,The Worst Holiday I‚Äôve Ever Been On,I‚Äôm going to try and keep this review short and give you what I think you need to know if your looking to stay here as I could most probably write a book about it.    Quick not before starting we booked to stay here for a lovely relaxing break for 11 nights and we left 6 days early !    First this is classed as a 5 star hotel. On first glance the lobby yes looks very flash and fancy. But looking 5 star doesn‚Äôt mean it is.    If you arrive before 3pm like we did you will not get a key to your room only a wristband and told to go get lunch. To which we personally weren‚Äôt shown where anything was yet when being on holiday we saw multiple times couples been shown around after check in. On arrival there is a ¬£85 deposit you can give in cash that goes into a envelope and is given back on checkout but please note any notes with writing on they won‚Äôt accept for some reason.    I‚Äôve broken down the rest of the reviews into sections.    ROOM  Rooms are probably the best part of this hotel cleaned everyday comfy beds nice bathroom and if your the right side of the resort by pool bar pool it‚Äôs nice a quiet but you can hear every step someone takes below and beside you so if you want a early night good luck. If your room is the other side by the loud pool you will have very loud rap music all day. Tea and coffee in room with fresh water in fridge everyday but no milk.    STAFF  Ermmm. Where do I start ! I think we can say out of this army of staff 2 of them where ok ! We was either ignored spoken to like trash or rudely served. I like to add this only happen to us because we are a same sex couple. Everyone else we saw had a very very warm welcome and offered drinks and chair pulled out.    SERVICE  Horrendous by far the worst I‚Äôve ever experienced. We had multiple days of having no drinks offered to us at the Resturant again everyone did just not us. Blanked and when we had to go and ask our drinks where nearly on the floor after the way they chucked them on the table. Every time we walked in the Resturant or bar no hello welcome nothing but yet a couple behind get a hello. Snack bar by bother 6 people working there no service for 25 minutes by then that was just us others served straight away.    CLEANLINESS  Great clean room and gardens are kept well. Pool was the dirtiest pool I‚Äôve been it. We was there for 6 days and by day 6 it was clear it still hadn‚Äôt been cleaned. Black dirty floating around.    FOOD  If you don‚Äôt eat fish or beef with bones in it good luck. I eat neither and I really struggled all (hot) food was luck warm or cold. Same every day just recycled meat and vegetables. Food not labelled so you think your eating rice with mix veg until you find the whole of the ocean mixed in it.    ACTIVITIES/ENTERTAINMENT  Boring nothing to do. Entertainment doesn‚Äôt start until 10pm and even then bored and dull.    SPA/GYM  Gym was good clean all worked a lot smaller than the picture and not cold in there. Spa no free so if you think you get that included you won‚Äôt.    We honestly felt ignored here treated like s**t and had the worst service because we are a Same sex couple. If your a same sex couple please don‚Äôt go here and waste your money. Even if all the service side of things didn‚Äôt happen. I still wouldn‚Äôt call this a 5 star more like a 3 star.    We spent over ¬£2000 worked our asss off to pay for this dream holiday to leave 6 days early because we felt uneasy. And not welcomed. Also to turn up to 5 star hotel with strict rules and food times and with nothing going for it.,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bideford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thebritishreviewer
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Toohonest wrote a review Jul 2019,50,Birthday Celebration,Great Hotel!!!    Hospitality:-  Initially greeted us with mint tea and cake/biscuit upon our arrival.  Accommodating to all our request...e.g iron drinks etc.    Very modern and clean hotel  Hotel room and balcony are a generous size and the gardens well manicured.  Resturants and snack bar serve a good variety of choices and are open at good hours and cheif is present to make certain dishes at your request.  Staff also arefriendly.    Entertainment- there is an activities pool and a relaxing pool and they do not effect each other at all. Good range of activities e.g archery mini golf aqua aerobics and mojito parties.    Sports bar open until 1pm with board games snooker and TV and sandwiches.    There is night entertainment daily at 10pm prompt e.g belly dancing and sax player    Minor con:-  query some of the staff always understood our request because at times got an order of drinks that we didn't request for or was forgotten. They would benefit from knowing exactly what is requested instead of trying to guess sometimes or just saying 'yes'.,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sweetlove89

The food on offer each day in the main restaurant was plentiful each day different dishes with lots of variety always well cooked and tasty.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Daisyflower93 wrote a review Jul 2019,30,Disappointing,Hotel was rated 5 star. I am very well traveled and have stayed in many 5 star hotels across the world and at best I would give this hotel 3. Don‚Äôt get me wrong the building rooms and pool themselves are lovely and very clean but this is where the good points end. The food is average at best and the ‚ÄúA la carte‚Äù restaurant was honestly the worst food I have ever consumed in my life. As for alcohol at the pool bars it is watered down/rationed and the service behind the bar is unfriendly. That is me being kind. I think we saw the bar tender smile once in the whole weeks stay. Some staff were fairly pleasant but most were miserable and inattentive. We felt pressured to have photos taken by the poolside by a ‚Äúphotographer‚Äù which we would have had to have payed for and although we politely declined we where still continually harassed about it. The animation team appeared to just sit around and gossip all day and were about as exciting as watching paint dry. Which brings me to my final point. The awful night life. Absolutely no atmosphere what so ever and again average at best.

Wifi is very poor. limited connectivity in rooms on first floor and around pool. Pool bar service slow and confused more staff required. Food at snack bar good but again rather confused service you dont allways get what you ordered. Food in main resurant OK but food gets cold quickly once on show. Main bar service very good but only local non brand drinks free so this is not good for a so called 5 star all inclusive experience. Rooms clean and maid service excellent. Golf coursed here are fantastic and not busy (July). Our driver to golf was excellent and allways on time. Marrakech is a fun place to visit rather dirty in places Medina busy and intersting.

My experience was so positive. The staff were amazing so friendly. I thought I would have issues as I don't speak French but no. From check in to check out the staff were super. My special thanks go to Abdessamad and Raaga in the Restaurant who looked after me for the 10 days I was there. I was always greeted with friendly smiles and didn't have to ask for drinks as they were there in an instant. Around the pool were Mustafa the pool boy and Titif who I did stretch with most mornings. Special thank you to Karim who very patiently helped me with my archery skills until I could hit the bulls eye!    I asked for a quiet room and it was perfect. Okay there was no view but the room was spacious clean and quiet. Bed was really comfy and the shower was powerful and hot. Everything I needed. As for food I can't say too much as I am happy with fruit and salad and there was plenty of that. As for tea making facilities although no milk was provided this was not a problem. I just went to the bar and asked for tea bags and milk to take to the room and they were more than happy to do this.,Date of stay: June 2019,,"Warrington, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1Barann

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Steph B wrote a review Jun 2019,50,Fabulous,Had a great stay at this beautiful hotel. We did have an issue with our first room 1011 as after retuning for the afternoon it smelt of sewage which got worse when my daughter had a shower. This was promptly resolved by reception who moved is to the first floor 5206. Rooms are modern and spacious and beds are comfy.    Plenty of sun beds around the pool and we managed to get a cabana most days. There were also lots of parasols for shade. As others have mentioned the lack of plastic glasses at the pool bar was an issue and I felt sorry for the young lad serving.    Food was delicious ..... best I have had on an all inclusive hotel. Cocktails were divine and they made my daughter expresso martinis which are her favourite. We got some smaller notes from reception and tipped our favourite staff which was well appreciated.    Evening entertainment was a little disappointing. It was sometimes difficult to get a seat and 2 nights there was just a DJ playing. WiFi was ok in reception but patchy in other parts of the hotel.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,sareenab22 wrote a review Jun 2019,30,Good but needs attention,"Booked this hotel for a week. First of all our flight was awful - do not book with Royal Air Morocco. Our baggage was left in Casablanca and we had to collect it the next day. Apparently this has been happening a lot recently so book with a reliable airline.    The hotel was lovely the room was clean and the facilities were great. With regards to the food I found it to be cold most days perhaps keeping it constantly warm would be better - no one likes a hot omelette with cold beans and sausages! The staff weren't very friendly either and they were nicer to those who either spoke French or Arabic. They never came over to ask if we would like any drinks with our food and when we did ask it would take them 15 minutes to bring a coke! The waiters were quite forgetful. There was one guy in particular who was very rude I went to approach him for a drinks before I said anything he started saying ""Coke? Coke? Coke?"" When all I wanted was a glass of wine he had no manners so I did my best to avoid him any time I went for food. The Moroccan restaurant was also very basic and the food didn't taste very good. I think the hotel would benefit from either more restaurants or more variety in the buffet. The evening entertainment was also very good! With live music and belly dancers.    Our rooms were lovely and very clean although the housekeepers weren't consistent and the last couple of days they didn't clean our room. They provide teas and coffee in the room but when I called and asked for milk the receptionist was quite rude and said I had to go to the kitchen and get some. It would also be better if they provided water instead of ask having to ask for it perhaps putting a few bottles in the mini fridge.    The hotel was nice overall. There's a shuttle bus which takes you to the city which was nice. The cost of a taxi to the airport was 250 dirham which I thought was a lot for a 20 minute journey. It is a great place to relax for a few days. I think the hotel needs to consider the small things manners included.",Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sareenab22
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,travelsingh wrote a review Jun 2019,50,Great mini break,We went away last minute for an escape and celebration and had emailed the hotel before hand to see if there was anything special they could do for us to celebrate and was very pleased that although they could not promise me anything they did reply back to me.    We had booked a standard double room but was very pleased upon arrival to be told that we had been upgraded to a pool view double room. The room was very clean and fresh looking and there was an amazing cake that was there for us when we got there. This was a lovely touch.    The hotel is great and there is plenty to keep most people happy. The entertainment team work hard to kepp everyone smiling and there was never a rush for us to scramble for sun beds there were plenty available and always managed to find somewhere to sit.    The drinks and the waiting staff were all pleasant and the Mojito's are some of the best i've ever had. We really enjoyed the food every evening in the buffet restaurant and was happy not to see chips but a range of other foods available.    The entertainment was good and managed to watch all the football I wanted to in the sports bar even when it was not open I asked the entertainment team who were more than happy to open up and put it on.    The free shuttle bus available to get into the Marrakech centre it was great to visit the markets and see the Mosque.    There is a steep charge for late check out but we were very lucky to avoid this as I had cheekily emailed to ask if we could have longer for free and the lovely reception team allowed me to have an extra few hours for free this really meant we were able to enjoy our last day. And for the final few hours we had pre booked ourselves into the lovely spa for a Rhassoul Hammam and massage treatment.

Every time we came for a meal the waiting staff recognised us and spoke to us by name which added a wonderful personal touch. The staff at reception pool and the cleaning staff were equally friendly and helpful! On our last night Omar and Amine in particular were fantastic and did their best to tend to our every need! Our waiter also took a personal interest when one of our party became ill and had to leave the table which we appreciated a lot! Everyone made us feel so welcome and we can't wait to come back! We would recommend staying here 100 per cent! We have been to Marrakech a number of times now and this is one of our favourite places to stay!

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Lisa-Marie M wrote a review Jun 2019,50,Wonderful hotel and FAB staff,We arrived home Saturday after a weeks stay in this beautiful resort. We were greeted by the staff on reception where we were given our bands and keys etc. We paid the deposit of 1000 dirham which was held on our card for the towel cards (this was returned as soon as we handed these back and handed back our bands at the end of the holiday).    The food in the main buffet was lovely definitely something for everyone lots of meat fish veg potatoes etc good for someone who is quite fussy. I didn‚Äôt find a problem at all with any of the food and both my partner and I found the desserts absolutely fabulous! The √° la cart√® was pretty nice but I found the staff took ages to come to our table and they only offered 2 set menus which wasn‚Äôt amazing and we overall much preferred the buffet restaurant.    Every evening we went into the lobby bar the bar staff were amazing shout out to Azedione the happy waiter who continuously kept our drinks topped up! The loveliest guy in the world and always smiling.    The sports bar Mohcine made the greatest cocktails ever and was ever so friendly. Always willing to do make you cocktail after cocktail and open until 1am. There are also sandwiches available if you are hungry later on in the evening and lots of games on offer at the bar!    We stayed by the relaxing pool until 2pm when the sun hit out swim up pool and stayed up until 8/8.30pm. The pool bar was also lovely and it was nice to have a drink whilst also in the pool.    We took the free shuttle bus into the market however where it drops you off is around a 15 minute walk to the Medina where the market is. Be careful for fake tour guides offering you a trip everywhere for ¬£1. We were suggested by another family in the hotel an app called Maps.me which downloads the map on WiFi in the hotel and you can pin where you get off the bus and use it to direct you back without using mobile data. It was a great suggestion and really helped us otherwise we could not have got back to the bus.    Every member of staff was lovely and said hello etc always happy to help even the maid who cleaned our room. It was very friendly there.    Overall we had such an amazing holiday and really really enjoyed ourselves. We loved Marrakech and we would love to return. Thank you Be Live for an amazing week we had such a great time and feel like you deserve all the recognition.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Southampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/663lisamariem
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,manhatten15 wrote a review Jun 2019,30,Not too bad,Just returned from a 5 day break here with my fianc√©e all we wanted was to relax for a few days somewhere hot.  The hotel is not a 5 star I'd give it 3.5 to 4 max. I found the grounds and pool area nice enough but the 2 bars had only 1 or sometime 2 servers and it didn't look very clean the plastic cups were dirty most of the time. I found the staff to be a little stand offish they worshipped the French guests but I didn't find them friendly or approachable at all. The rooms were ok and the bed was very comfortable. There is nothing in the mini bar which most 5 start hotels have and there is no room service. The cleaning was inconsistent one day they only made the bed and didn't empty the bins the next they didn't leave ANY towels when I called for some it took 40 mins for someone to bring us some. I found the entertainment boring and the hotel is literally in the middle of nowhere so you have to get a taxi everywhere.  We checked out at 12:00 but were not leaving for the airport until 19:00. I was told that I had to remove my wrist band and if I wanted to use the facilities and have anything to eat or drink before leaving for the airport then I'd have to pay! Never have I experienced this at a 5 start hotel. I wanted to have a shower before going to the airport and they wouldn't even let me use a towel. So the saying is true; you get what you pay for and as it was such a bargain trip it was ok to just sit and relax in the sun in a very quiet and laid back hotel. If I ever return to Marrakesh I'd book somewhere else to stay.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/manhatten15

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,ZoeVBC wrote a review Jun 2019,50,4*,We stayed at the Be Live Marrakech in June 2019. It is a lovely hotel but there are a few teaks that would really give it the 5*'s that it rates itself as.    The rooms were spacious beds comfy and the bathrooms well fitted. Balcony facing the car park wasn't ideal but the road was practically silent so no problems there.    Food was great all buffet but huge choice and fresh and tagine pizza bread fish veggies salads and meats on offer every day so its a good variety.    Table service with drinks was a bit hit and miss. Some waiters are excellent... some not so much.    Pools are lovely if a little cold but perfect for a hot day. Loungers are comfy and there are lots of cabanas too.    there is a free coach to the Medina running several times a day which is fab.    The pool towel guest wrist band and check in and out process were all bizarre and purely administrative - seemingly pointless. Elevating the service and streamlining these processes would make it a far nicer customer experience.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Royal Tunbridge Wells, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZoeVBC
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Georgia P wrote a review Jun 2019,50,Really impressed,We visited here just last week and were very happy with the holiday. Most of the staff were friendly the cleaners were great they changed the whole bedding every day and refilled the little free shower things. The resort was in pristine condition. The only things I would knock from this hotel was the deposit and the snack bar. When you arrive you are told you must pay a deposit of ¬£50GBP for the room and an extra ¬£20 if you would like use of the hotel towels for the pool. The money isn't held incase anything happens it does get taken and as it stands we still haven't had it refunded yet. When the receptionist refunded it they dont even check the room incase anything is damaged I see this as being pointless. The snack bar... with the resort being spotless you are very restricted as to what food/glasses you can take into certain area. The snack bar is located near the 'loud pool' and I would call it a restaurant. You have to take a seat and they come and bring you a menu and you order (this takes about 15 minutes each time though) then they make your food which again takes about 20 minutes. Every other all inclusive I've stayed at you usually get a panini which is grilled in front of you and takes max 10 mins. This isn't the best when you literally want to grab something quickly. Everything else was great the food drinks rooms the two different pools. Would definitely stay again!,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgiaanniep

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,LoveTravel579497 wrote a review Jun 2019,30,3 star at 5 star prices,Not worth the money as not 5 star. Other guests agreed and 1 described as a 4 star with a spa.    The hotel staff for the most part were helpful and friendly but the service lacked at the snack bar and pool bar. It was slow and they got your order wrong every time. They didn't greet you or talk with you  The evening staff at the lobby bar however were very friendly and the service was great. The standard of drink was better too however still more choice required.    Yes the hotel is modern and very clean but it lacked any sense of tradition or culture or splashes of colour. Everything was neutral and plain.    There was no room service or poolside service.    The hotel is in the middle of nowhere so traveling is via taxi or the free shuttle. You cannot walk anywhere.  It's a 15 minutes bus ride to city centre.    I would recommend to stay here but lower expectations to a high quality 3 star.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveTravel579497

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,thommo34 wrote a review Jun 2019,30,"Looks can be deceiving, definitely not 5 star!!",We visited Be Live Collection in April 2019 for a long weekend. Having already visited Marrakech we opted not to stay in a Riad in the old city this time and went for the '5 Star' out of town hotel instead.    Located about half an hour from the airport on the other side of the city the location is ok as we wanted to relax by the pool and venture into the city occasionally. There is a courtesy bus from the hotel to La Mamounia Hotel near the main square and it takes about 20-25 minutes several times a day but you need to book in advance as it gets busy at certain times.    First impressions of the hotel were good the lobby was large and impressive check-in was pretty quick. We where shown to our room the hotel is only 2 stories so its more spread out with rooms built around little courtyards. Our room was a little walk from the reception it was clean and a good size with everything you would need.    There are two swimming pools (both unheated and absolutely ice cold in April!) a quiet one with swim up bar and a bigger activity pool with music and events. There is also a sports bar with pool table etc and big screen a pool snack bar between the two pools a lobby bar that in the evening has load music and entertainment. The main buffet restaurant and a smaller a la carte restaurant I'll come back to these.    Our room lock stopped working while we were there and twice I had to walk back to the reception for them to re validate my room key and then explain that it still didn't work and wait for maintenance to come and fix it while it was a nuisance in the heat maintenance we pretty quick and fixed the issue. In the main restaurant there was a waiter who was very attentive and good at his job called Abdessamad!    These though were the only occasions that the service was good in this hotel. They do not have enough staff to start with. The quiet pool has a swim up bar and only one member of staff working it understandably come lunchtime and the afternoon heat the bar got busy and long queues formed then he would inevitably run out of something and disappear for 5-10 mins to get more. I felt sorry for him as he was doing his best but there should have been at least 2 people working that bar. By contrast the pool bar between the two pools had three or four people on it but service was worse we sat down a at table the first day we arrived and then went to get a menu to be told they would bring one over they did a couple of minutes later. So the following day we sat down and waited for a menu for 15 minutes they weren't even busy loads of empty tables and they walked past us several times it was only when we got up to get one that one was given to us.    In the buffet restaurant the food was the same pretty much everyday whether lunch or dinner and they never seemed to cater for everyone so things would run out all the time and people would be standing around waiting for more to come out. At the pizza station they had a choice of three but only made one of each at a time and wouldn't start to make a new one until that was gone so people standing around waiting. When we spoke to management they said there's some there one slice of one of the pizza's no apology about the display being empty.    The plates are dotted around the dining room under the counter but frequently ran out and people would have to ask for more plates. At breakfast the glasses for juice were always running out they just didn't have enough when they did bring some out it would be about 20 and so many people were waiting they would go straight away and people would be waiting again! 5 star? They haven't even got enough crockery should have plenty of these that they are always full!    The A la carte restaurant you qualify to eat here once for stays of 4 nights or more you need to book in advance at reception. A la carte is a bit misleading there's a choice of two set menu's but the food quality was good and made for a lovely change to the awful buffet.    This hotel at best is 4 star but the service was something else and drags it down to 3 star the staff I think are trying but the management don't seem interested we complained a couple of times and got some sort of excuse and that was it!    Shame because it has potential relatively new hotel but we would definitely not stay here again!,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"West Sussex, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thommo34

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Jessica N wrote a review Jun 2019,50,(Almost) perfect break,Arrival: 20-30 minutes' drive outside of Marrakech the hotel almost appears out of nowhere. It is one story and unassuming but beautiful from the outside. Reception area very clean and bright with plenty of seating options a well-stocked and variable gift shop and a small boutique. We arrived at 2.45 checked in and were surprised to find that there was a city tax (17 euro) a room deposit (100 euro) and a towel depot (can't remember price). we were given information about dining and bus shuttles by the quite frankly very rude reception staff and promptly told to go eat lunch before we saw our room. when we asked about our luggage they said it would be fine where it is (in the middle of the reception floor).    Departure: Our flight was late and we didn't need to leave the hotel until 5pm so we asked for a late check out on arrival and were rudely told we had to ask the day of departure. so we did and thankfully there was availability and we managed to get late checkout until 3pm (for a 60 euro fee) and keep our all-inclusive wrist bands until we left at 5pm.    The room: We chose a swim-up room which wasn't actually swim up because if you veered outside of the part directly in front of your own room you would be in other guest's space. Aside from that small detail the room was very comfortable bright and clean. The bed was among the most comfortable I have ever slept in and slept soundly every night. the pillows were out of the world! There is a mini-fridge but is not stocked within the all-inclusive package but the hotel does provide a large bottle of water daily to the room. There is a kettle and tea and coffee in the room. The bathroom was strange; there is a window from the bathroom into the bedroom. there is a blind that when pulled you cannot see into the bathroom from the bedroom during the day but at night when the bedroom is dark if you turn the light on in the bathroom there may as well not be any blind there! Can see everything! The shower was nice pressure and adjustable temperature but the bathroom completely flooded every time you even had a quick shower. This is clearly an on-going issue as the bottom of the bathroom door was warped when we arrived. Bathroom amenities included a hairdryer shower cap shampoo body wash body lotion a comb soap and a couple of glasses. Directly outside the room was a patio with two chairs and a table and two sun loungers at the swim-up pool. The pool was cold in the mornings but very refreshing and comfortable in the afternoons and evenings and was very enjoyable.    Food and drink: what can I say? food and drinks were bottomless. the buffet had a wide range and catered to majority of palates. Breakfast was varied with an omelette station and continental if desired. Lunch always included a pizza pasta red meat chicken fish salad and an array of salad and vegetable options. Dinner was the same. House wine and beer is available in the buffet restaurant at meal times. The Lobby Bar was exceptional. staff were friendly (majority speak French but good English also). Fabulous outdoor seating area at the bar. The staff are on the ball I think they thought our names were Gin and Tonic by the end!    Pools: there are two pools; one is an activity pool with aqua aerobics and other activities throughout the day. there are also ping-pong tables and you can play archery. The second pool is more chilled scattered with couples sipping their drinks from the pool bar. plenty of loungers and cabanas it was very enjoyable.    Overall: We were there to decompress for a few days both leading very busy lives at home so it was perfect for us. We didn't venture into Marrakech instead opting to make full use of the all-inclusive package and our swim-up room! We enjoyed our stay very much and will definitely be back. if you can get past the rudeness of the reception staff then the rest is very much enjoyable.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I953YFjessican

Cosmetically the hotel was beautiful room was lush pool and surroundings where just stunning. Unfortunately how this got a 5* for service is beyond us as its most certainly not that yet. Short staffed wrong things given 3 days to get room service (namely an ironing board!) and having to wait AGES for drinks and service in the restaurants. I would not return to this hotel unfortunately its not worth the money paid for it in my opinion. Also if your a couple who are going ensure your not of the shy type and the rooms have an adjoining window into the bedroom/living room which is completely see-through so you will see all being done in the bathroom! (toilet is separate) but shower etc is all open for all to see 2 way into the room lol so being shy is not an option! ;-) Also we had a balcony door which did not lock - DIY also was not a strong point for this hotel.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Soozywong wrote a review Jun 2019,30,All that glitters is not gold,I booked this ‚Äòbudget‚Äô alleged 5 star hotel as a surprise for my husbands birthday through Voyage Priv√©.  The reviews mainly read well and for a 5* all inclusive hotel for 4 nights how bad could it be? We have previously stayed at The Four Seasons the Mandarin Oriental and Marmounia so feel quite well placed to make a comparison.  Clearly other reviewers are not as well travelled - the Belive Collection in Marrakech is a 3/4 star hotel at best. If anyone thinks it is a 5 star hotel they are delusional! But for the price it is ok at best.  We took an early morning flight to maximise our time - big mistake. Check out time is 11.00am and Check in time is 3.00pm. Why it takes 4 hours to do a turn around is beyond me? Maybe the fact that they take a room deposit in addition to full payment may explain the calibre of guests they are used to - which is why they need 4 hours to clean up?! We arrived at 10.30am and got into our room at 3.00pm Bad form. When I enquired how much longer it would be I was told I should have taken a later flight! That kind of summed up the ethos of the hotel.  There is also a towel deposit taken upon arrival for use of towels by the pool. This is restricted to ONE towel per person. It‚Äôs not as though the towels are thick and fluffy - but you only get one!  Use it wisely! All inclusive clearly doesn‚Äôt extend to towels!  Upon arrival we were given wrist bands which shows the staff you are guests of the hotel. The hotel is in the middle of nowhere and a 30 minute taxi ride into Marrakech - who are they expecting to infiltrate - especially to steal their towels! There is Nothing in the surrounding area and by nothing I mean absolutely squat diddly.  The rooms are reasonably well appointed. Large and comfortable. There is a fridge which is stocked with nothing but a bottle of water. Clearly All inclusive doesn‚Äôt extend to the fridge either!  There is a kettle a couple of tea bags coffee and sugar but milk isn‚Äôt included either.  The bathrooms are of a good size with double sinks but the amenities are poor. The tiniest piece of  soap imaginable small shampoo shower gel body lotion sponge shower cap and comb. Oh I forgot a razor! No cotton buds conditioner cotton wool nail files or anything actually useful. Again only one towel per person is allowed. There is clearly a towel issue here!  We booked a room with a swim up pool but being on the edge doesn‚Äôt the afford the luxury of swimming anywhere - it reached my knees!  There are two large swimming pools with plenty of sun loungers however there are no cushions on the chairs and bearing in mind you are only allowed one towel this doesn‚Äôt help on the comfort level.  There are two restaurants - one only available every 4 nights and the main buffet restaurant.  There is also a snack bar which is limited depending on what time you want to eat - however the food is good. Hamburgers and Pizza are worth ordering.  The main buffet restaurant at breakfast is average at best. Breakfast has a reasonably good assortment of choices however completely spoilt by the chef who makes the eggs. Instead of using spatulas to serve up the food - he uses one spatula and his bare hands! Call me fussy but if anyone is going to physically touch my food - it‚Äôs going to be me!  Lunch however was very nice and dinner was pretty much the same as lunch with a couple of additions. Nothing too exciting!  The A la Carte restaurant has two set menus and waiter service which is a rare treat as it is clearly lacking from the rest of the hotel. The two waiters Tarim and Mourac should definitely be promoted.  Both speak English are friendly and want to be of service - more than I can say for the rest of the hotel (and lack of distinguishable management)  We chose to eat out on three of our four nights - our choice as there are some fantastic restaurants in Marrakech.  There is a good selection of drinks which is All inclusive so no complaints there.  Would I come again - No. Would I recommend it - No. Is it good value for money........if you have no expectations of receiving 5 star service from an alleged 5 star hotel - it ticks the box but a 5 star hotel it certainly isn‚Äôt. Management is nowhere to be seen - it runs itself....somewhat unprofessionally.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Soozywong

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,jess966 wrote a review Jun 2019,50,Lovely quiet hotel for adults,Spend 7 days at this hotel with a friend for a girls break. We were looking for a quiet hotel geared for adults with a nice atmosphere and this was it.    I made some requested before arriving directly with the hotel and they fulfilled all of them. I wanted two separate double beds in our room as we weren't a couple and a surprise for my friend on her 30th birthday. Be-live really came through and delivered. Had a birthday cake at the exact time/day requested and put up surprise balloons in the evening. Very pleased with this and commend the hotel for their efforts. Room wasn't massive but was clean very quiet comfy beds great shower couldn't ask for much more accommodation wise. Felt it was worth every penny.    Food was great I have recently been travelling to Mexico and Jamaica in hotels that offer a massive array of food 24hrs a day and was pleasantly surprised on standard and choice here at what I would class as a small hotel. Good wine and alcohol brands which was great for all inclusive. Table service in evening brilliant however at breakfast was always trying to catch the waiters eye for a cup of tea/coffee which was annoying and often went without. Diner included freshly prepared food and the dining room and other areas were always super clean.    Two swimming pools one quiet and another with some form of music and entertainment so probably suits most... tranquil feel all round water was lovely temperature and bar service at pool was quick. Only complaint would be the gardeners mowing strimming cutting all day long some days which was annoying noise levels if you really want super chilled environment as the loud sounds seemed to go on and on. But i must say the clientele at the hotel was great making a positive and relaxing atmosphere.    Spa booking was easy to book not over priced did some great packages over all experience was good. I'm a gym goer and was disappointed to find no air-conditioning! it was boiling and uncomfortable to workout in their. Decent equipment usable to get by on a couple weeks holiday.    Location was fantastic if you want to venture out- 10 mins into town we took a couple trips out and was handy being so close to the city centre. They offer a good shuttle service that's regular. Hotel also has good security for anyone conscious of this aspect.    Evening entertainment started at 10pm... every night was something different apart from the warm up singer was the same each night which got a little boring and could have been a little more upbeat.    Overall this was a suburb holiday and I would come back to this hotel and felt it was worth every penny!,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Norwich, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jess966
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Aeroguy757 wrote a review Jun 2019,40,Relaxation and surprise addition,"My wife and I were here for two weeks from 27th May and had a swim up room which was lovely. When checking in we paid our room deposit in cash (Sterling) and this was put into a sealed envelope and handed back to us when leaving. Swim up rooms are in the three blocks to the right of reception and face west so the sun hits the room in the afternoon. There is no real shade then so use a high factor sun screen. The other three blocks to the left do not have swim up rooms. In all there are six accommodation blocks and each have different names are arranged around a themed courtyard relating to that name. Guests are provided with bathrobe and comfortable soft slippers. If you are staying in an upper level room then please use the slippers as a courtesy to the guests below who will hear your footsteps and furniture rearranging. An interesting point I found out is that the hotel kitchen is underground and apparently connects to the pool bar by tunnel.  As with other reviewers we found the staff to be super friendly and helpful and the hotel spotlessly clean throughout.  The food quality was consistent and very tasty with something for everyone. Be aware that the norm is to serve wine chilled and asking for red wine at room temperature may result in a small delay as the waiter may have to go and get some specially for you. The hand sanitizer by the main door has to be hit fairly hard to work so people probably though it was empty and were not bothering to use it. We took our own. We did not book the al la carte due to the negative feed back and experiences of other guests.  We also experienced the one bar person serving at a time scenario. The bar staff are great the serving policy not so good. Some bars had two or more staff behind the counter but only one actually getting you a drink. It's funny to see an orderly line start to form at busy times at the lobby bar. The management really need to sort this out.  However whilst you are waiting in line you can try to figure out what song you are listening to. You'll know the song but not the style in which it being performed. Ever heard ""The Show Must Go On"" by Queen done in a bossa - nova style? Actually it's quite fun and passes the time as you are queuing.  We took our own plastic glasses and coffee cups so we didn't have the fun of drinking beer from a cocktail glass unfortunately but we did see it happening. The staff were quite happy to fill them for us and take them back to our room for the afternoon laze in the sun. Take metal or reusable straws with you and do your bit for the environment too.  The Sports bar is advertised as opening at 10 PM however it is open (but not staffed or serving drinks) earlier in the day and allows the sports fans to try and catch an event. There is one giant t.v. and another smaller one in a side section which allows for a different event to be followed. The commentary is foreign so no clash of sounds to worry about.  Just beyond the sports bar was a great surprise new addition and is not listed on websites (or even the daily activities board). The hotel has built a brand new boules court with games taking place at 11 a.m and 5 p.m.  It's a great way to meet people and is so quick and easy to learn so give it a go! I would hope that they invest in a tape measure and rake at some point oh and a scoreboard would be good too. Early days for this activity but well done for it!  We also used the gym a few times. It's well equipped with fresh towels and sanitizer sprays but could do with a bit more air con perhaps. Be aware that you can access it by the outside steps in the early morning before the spa opens.  The hotel has a mix of age groups and nationalities with many people just coming for a few days. We felt like long term residents after ten days let alone two weeks however small things apart it was a very enjoyable holiday and would recommend.",Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Staffordshire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aeroguy757

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Michelle S wrote a review Jun 2019,50,Amazing relaxing holiday,Just returned from 10 nights at this beautiful hotel with my partner  Quick and easy check in and shown to our room and how to work the AC.  Room was simple luxury. Ours was facing away from the pool not the greatest view but fantastic sunrise over the Atlas Mountains! The beds are incredibly comfortable. Room cleaned everyday fresh towels provided and gorgeous displays left for you to find when you return to your room.    Can‚Äôt comment on the animation pool as we didn‚Äôt use it but the relaxed pool was brilliant not very deep but lots of steps and ledges to sit and cool off with a cocktail from the pool bar or swim if you want to. And plenty of loungers and cabanas.    Plenty of choice when it comes to food..if you miss breakfast at the buffet you can get a late breakfast at the snack bar. Snack bar burgers were lovely! Loved the food in the buffet restaurant and never had any issues here.    Drinks were great BUT..a few little points to be made..there were times when our drinks had little or no alcohol so maybe a little training in measures needed? We used the lobby bar pool bar and snack bar all three bars could use an extra staff member or 2 at peak times..this said we never waited too long to be served and always with a smile. Glasses are an issue. The plastic glasses used around the pool are quite old and look quite worn so need replacing and maybe doubling in quantity. Maybe stick to bottled beers as beer from a cocktail glass is just odd.    All the staff here are amazing. We were always greeted with a smile. Even just walking through the hotel or grounds every staff member we came across said hello. After about the fourth day everyone knew our drinks order before we asked including the waiters.    Entertainment was good. Belly dancers and Latino night were great even the karaoke was good!    Already looking forward to our next visit!

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Eve C wrote a review Jun 2019,50,Birthday Treat,My husband and I just spent a long weekend at this hotel as a birthday treat to ourselves and we couldn't have chosen a better hotel. The rooms were so luxurious and spotless with clean towels and fluffy robes every day. Being an adults only hotel the atmosphere was calm and relaxing with daily activities like archery yoga and aqua aerobics to keep you going. The pool area was amazing with free books available to read table tennis and a swim up pool bar. The food was delicious however it was a tad cold at times. However that could be forgiven for the luxurious surroundings of the hotel the wonderful staff and the entertainment at night time. Even the sports bar had games in it to keep you amused. It was a bit away from Marrakech but there was a shuttle bus service available and taxis could be organized at any time.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,London Ferret wrote a review Jun 2019,40,"Lovely Hotel and staff, bar needs sorting",Absolutely lovely hotel beautiful grounds. Not massive but really well kept and feels spacious. Plenty of sunbeds. There is an animations pool with music not too loud and a much quieter pool for relaxing. You can also pay to use the indoor pool in the health centre.  The staff are almost all absolutely lovely and really care about making sure you have a nice holiday. They don't hassle you and are very helpful. Not a big fan of animations but the team were really nice and very enthusiastic and always had something going on ‚Äì aquarobics archery spin class etc  Food is plentiful and very varied. The cous-cous was great I ended up having it almost every day. Wine is somewhat dodgy but it is Morocco.  Beer is ok. Cocktails are interesting and are completely different depending on who makes them but that's part of the fun in an all-inclusive.  Room was lovely nice beds & linen. Floors are stone and reverberate dreadfully ‚Äì first couple of nights kept awake by people upstairs who continually moved furniture around all night in high heels!!??? Quieter after that though. Don't think they turn the AC on until May?  There are two bars a sports bar which is oddly quite relaxing and opens I think about 10:30 and the main bar.  Only 2 real complaints for the whole holiday the first would be that they should sort out the service at the main bar. This is a big problem and they know about it so I assume it is deliberate. There's frequently only one person serving drinks sometimes two. Very often I would have to wait 20 minutes to get served. There are a couple of waiters but they are rushed off their feet and you can still wait a long time for them.  2nd complaint is that 2 days before we left they built a small stage outside the main bar facing the hotel with speakers facing the rooms. They then had live music at deafening volume which was so loud we could hear it in the room aver the tv! This went on until midnight on the last 2 days we were there which was a real shame. I hope it was only temporary as it was really awful.  The courtesy bus into town is a coach so usually plenty of seats but you do need to book in advance though staff are very obliging about this.  Other than that a great holiday and really pleasant staff!,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LondonFerret

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Debbi V wrote a review Jun 2019,50,Live Right Now at Be Live Collection - Lovely Holiday,"We are currently at the end of our first week here with one week to go. We are in room 1004 swim up room which catches the sun from around 12pm every day until the sun goes down. We are facing the pool with the swim-up bar.    When we arrived (late because our flight had been delayed) we were quickly checked in and then told that we could go to the Sports Bar for something to eat and drink. It was almost but not quite closing time. We got two very welcome cold beers (called Stork perfectly decent - they also do San Miguel but in smaller bottles) and a sandwich which was really tasty.    When we got to our room we noticed a sewage smell which was still there the next day. We mentioned it and they tried to sort it out but we had to change rooms. This was done very efficiently and with a small token of the hotel's apology (bottle of wine and a large plate of fruit and nuts). The new room was lovely and we are still there now. Unfortunately this second night I got no sleep at all as the pump for the water channel (pool) outside our room makes an awful droning noise which becomes very loud when the hotel quietens down after midnight. I had to go to reception at 3.30 as my head was ready to explode!!! Thankfully they turned off the pump and I was able to sleep. The next night I had to remind them to turn it off but subsequent nights they seemed to remember and get into a routine. But last night sadly they forgot so I had to remind them again. PLEASE PLEASE make this a daily routine for your maintenance staff. The noise is horrendous and right outside people's rooms. The pump is not needed overnight and the man comes to turn in back on in the morning. Such a small thing but important for your guests to get good sleep. Thanks.    The gym here is great with lovely staff who greet you with a towel and water if you want it. Equipment is fab but it needs to be connected to the wi-fi because it has features like Netflix and Spotify that can't be used because it just tells you that it is not connected. There is bluetooth for you to connect your headphones but this is useless without the connectivity. Otherwise a great gym.    There are plenty of activities like yoga pilates aqua gym and archery etc. They have just built a new boules pit but they don't have it in the programme yet which is a great shame. My husband is a great lover of boules and would play every day but no one is encouraged to play. Come on Animation Team... maybe you can do this before we leave next Monday! :)    The food is superb! We love it. We love the salads and the wide variety of cooked veggies. Some different meat too every night. Decent red white and rose wine but sparkling is not available on the All Inclusive.    Bar staff - in fact all staff - are lovely and helpful. Range of cocktails is decent although the bar service can be slow because there is usually only one person on and a large queue builds up.    In the sport bar we had an evening watching the Champions League final and although this was obviously known about in advance there were no cold beers!! It is a myth that us British like warm beers. I understand that it gets busy in there... but beers should be stocked up for special evenings and maybe consider draft??    Wide mix of nationalities here which is nice and people seem to come for odd number of days like 4! Long weekends from the UK to Morocco. Can't fault them! :)    All in all a lovely hotel. Very clean nice gardens lots of places to sit in the sun or in shade. Can't really comment about the pools or the availability of sunbeds as we luckily have our own but when I am having my coffee outside first thing in the morning I see people laying down their towels especially on the covered ""cabanas"".    What's that hubby? Cocktail time? Ok have to go.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,sonal d wrote a review May 2019,40,Time for a holiday break,Great hotel friendly and helpful. Do brush up on your french and arabic language skills as English is basic.    If you do have any general questions Marwa at the PR desk is very helpful.    Check in is at 3pm so if you arrive early you will be waiting. You will get a wristband so you can have food and drinks    Check out is at 12pm. You can ask on the day for a late check out but they will charge. We were asked to pay 600 dirhams to extend our room till 3pm.Thats ¬£20 an hour.    Wristbands are taken when you check out. If you arrived early and used the bar and food facilities then on check out you are not entitled to these anymore. If you do want to eat and drink then it is 400 dirham per person.    Do book to go to the restaurant on site called Ksar. The service is great and the food is scrumptious. Tariq looked after us very well.    The Spa on site is independent to the hotel so you cannot charge treatments to your room. Do fill in the health form before your first treatment. The treatments were excellent and very relaxing. A good deal can be had if you pay by cash. Mounir Ben Salem looked after us very well.    If you do not eat fish or beef you will struggle. Do be careful as labelling of foods is not the best. We did mention it on day 1 and by day 5 it was better. There are not enough serving utensils so guests use meat ones with veg so do ask for clean ones if not sure. Thank you to Amine & Adil the restaurant managers and Abdessamad & Omar the waiters who looked after us every day.,Date of stay: May 2019,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sonald252

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Jessie wrote a review May 2019,20,Not for the over 35s,Ok.. This place could be good but there are some major flaws that need sorting. In its defence the food is good the rooms are good and the housekeeping is fine.. The bad bits:  1. The owners need to take note. One server per bar is not enough! Everyone has said it but nothing seems to be changing. I watched a Barman taking 7-8 minutes to complete each order. When you have a new customer arriving every 2-3 minutes it's clear to see the problem.. its causing disconcernation. It's not the Bartenders fault he's just not well organised and overworked.  2. The nightly entertainment is not very imaginative the real problem is that because its outside every single room gets affected with noise pollution every single night. Fine if you want to watch the countless renditions of 80s songs but if you dont you cannot sleep until after midnight at the earliest.  3. The pool music playlist is questionable. On a few days part of the playlist had songs that made frequent use of the N word as well as frequent explicit sexual phrases. This is not acceptable. I do not want to hear the N word uttered by ANYBODY and although I'm no prude I'm not impressed by the poor music choices. This needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. Play music to the crowd you have. It caused me a lot of annoyance. Auto tuned rap is just not what you want in your ears all day.    The conclusion for me is If you want a generic resort holiday where you like the club 18-30 feel this will be fine for you. If you want a more ethnic morrocan experience and you dont like rap/house music all day look elsewhere. I wanted to like it but came away disappointed.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jessie_peoplesChamp

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,SofiaH wrote a review May 2019,30,Lovely hotel let down by understaffing :-(,My husband & I chose a 3 night stay for our 1st anniversary. The hotel has MANY plus points;  - lovely big modern rooms  - lots of food available all day long  - free shuttle to town daily  - 2 big pools 1 has music the other is lovely and quiet  - we liked the variety of food yes it‚Äôs a buffet but they have tagines meats fish pasta salads and gorgeous desserts    However there are a couple of things that could be improved but that really made our holiday a lot less enjoyable  -1 staff member per bar is not enough I am pregnant and all I wanted 90% of the time was a bottle of water but I had to queue for 30 minutes in some cases for the pleasure.  My suggestion would be to have a fridge with soft drinks/beers and the people only need to queue for cocktails and coffees etc  - loungers- there was enough but apart from the cabanas they were pretty uncomfortable I would suggest to purchase some padded covers for the rest    Overall the hotel is good but for usservice is THE most important factor and unfortunately lack of staffing let‚Äôs this hotel down :-(,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Wilmslow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SofiaHarrison

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,JordanOBrien wrote a review May 2019,10,Worst Service Ever!!,Do not stay at this hotel!!! The service is the worst service I have ever experienced anywhere in the world. Two nights in a row there was no cutlery with a queue of people waiting for them to bring some out. On lunch on our fourth day there was no plates- again there was a queue waiting for them to bring plates out. Dinner on our third night we had to ask 4 different waiters if we could order drinks- all of which told us they would come back and none of them did. In the end we had to leave the restaurant and go to the bar to get drinks and bring those into the restaurant. In The snack bar you can be waiting for 20-30 minutes just to order your food or even just to get a menu. There is one server for around 40 people. All of the drinks bars are extremely slow service. The food itself is extremely limited. Almost half of the buffet food is cold where it‚Äôs not kept heated properly. The snack bar is horrendous - if you order sausage and cheese from the breakfast menu- you literally received a plate of tiny triangles of cheese and tiny triangles of ham. Every person is the hotel was complaining about the food and service the entire time we were there.    The entertainment at night is very lacking- most nights it is just background music. When there is entertainment on it doesn‚Äôt start until 10pm and at this point most people have gone to bed.    On our 5th day our keys were not working so we went to reception to ask for new ones and they told me I had to speak with the manager. When I went to speak to him I was told I have to pay 1300 dirhams (around ¬£120) because there were stains on the bedsheets. When I told him I would not be paying this because it does not cost this much to replace them (and also because I‚Äôve never heard of hotels charging for stains on bedsheets) he compared it to me arriving at the hotel and not receiving the swim up room I had paid for- and instead receiving a basic room- I am still not sure on the relevance of this? He then said if I want to stay at a 5* hotel I should expect to pay this much for sheets! I only ever stay at 5* hotels anywhere I go in the world and I have never heard anything like this.    The only good thing about the hotel is the pool entertainment staff- especially Simo. Apart from this I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.,Date of stay: May 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JBOBrien18

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Kingsmeister wrote a review May 2019,50,Brilliant long weekend,After a flight delay and arriving at @3am I was pleased to have a swift and efficient check in and go to my room. The room is modern very clean and spacious. 2 queen size beds firm and comfortable - excellent rain shower and bathroom with twin sinks. he room had a patio leading onto the rear gardens. Summary - great room!  I am an early riser so when I arrived at the pool there was myself the gardener and pool cleaner tranquillity at its best. To be fair even after breakfast there were beds and cabanas available around both pools. Breakfast was great too - typical buffet arrangement of local Moroccan specialities. Possible improvement in service of tea and coffee and removal of used crockery but overall breakfast was good.  The pool areas are great clean and well presented. Quiet pool with swim up bar is great. Shout out for Omar who ran the swim up bar (bottled San Miguel!). The other pool has background music and is where the animation team hang out. Simo is the man to see here ! Kept us busy with table tennis archery and aqua aerobics to name a few. well done Simo and team.  Evening meals were varied and the Moroccan specialities were great very hot and tasty. The lobby bar is where the cocktail should be taken. Hand made and served in jam jars for as special touch - mojito is the one to go for.  We used the shuttle service into town too very prompt and efficient.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Carmen G wrote a review May 2019,40,Lovely Hotel - Though requires more staff and some smiles to give it that 5 *,Arrived home this week after a Fantastic Holiday in Marrakesh. The hotel was lovely - well laid out and beautiful gardens and 2 lovely pools.  We had a superior room which was very spacious  modern and great Air con. Huge bath separate toilet and huge shower. Room cleaned daily  Despite the food being roughly the same everyday lunch and dinner - i did thoroughly enjoy the food. Plenty of meats and seafood and tasty  Entertainment was every night and not the greatest for a 5* hotel and there were only  enough seats outside to sit around 40 people. ( there are 212 rooms at the hotel )  Ways where management could improve and make this the 5* it deserves is recruit more staff on the bars and in the dining hall and rethink the outdoor seating plan  One member of staff per bar is not sufficient and with other nations that Don't Queue caused many unnecessary altercations with other guests. This affected the snack bar pool bar Lobby bar and Dining Hall. No wonder the staff couldn't smile in these areas.  Sports Bar I enjoyed for a great cocktail by Mochine. Great guy thank you .  The hotel runs a shuttle bus which is handy as its about 20 mins in a bus from the Centre. Run fairly regularly.  Tip for Marrakesh - a map doesn't work. If you want to sight see there is a stop and start open top bus that stops right where you are dropped off. Or find someone in a decent restaurant or policeman for directions.  Take plenty of sun cream hat and mosquito spray  We went with Tui ( though we never saw a rep so all trips were booked on the app) I recommend the trip to Essaouira and Atlas Mountains  Overall great holiday and great Hotel though need to recuit more staff  One thing i will say if you have an early flight you can not check in until 3pm and you will also need to pay 600 dir deposit and 200 dir each for a towel. Pay in cash as you will get this back on check out .  Enjoy !!

The staff on the reception are very friendly and helpful. Beds are comfortable we slept really well. Wifi can be accessed almost everywhere in the hotel which is great.    The food is okay not great. And there are lots of flies in the dining room. Unfortunately the restaurant  and bars seem to be quite understaffed and so it can be a bit manic in the dining room trying to get cutlery or drinks.    It's difficult to get drinks at the pool bar as there is only 1 person there all day - he is doing his best but there are lots of people to serve.    Cocktails are hit and miss - mostly they are from a bottle. Very occasionally in the lounge bar they might be made and these are delicious. But these are the exception not the rule. Rose wine very nice.    Sports bar really fun and staff are fab but there is no air conditioning and so you can expect to be bitten by insects if you are in there longer than 5 minutes.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Sarah wrote a review May 2019,20,Don‚Äôt be fooled by the positive reviews,Although this hotel appears to be rated 5 star it really isn‚Äôt it‚Äôs more of a 2 star. Other than the rooms being nice there is not much else that is. Firstly we arrived and the reception took on average 25 minutes to help one guest with a line of at least 5 people it took ages. We arrived early so thought we‚Äôd get a drink by the pool. Shock- there was no alcohol in the pool bar no matter what drink we ordered. The bar that has a little bit of alcohol is the lobby bar don‚Äôt even bother with any of the others.    We then thought it would be good to go to the pool until our room was ready but towels are only available at certain times that are not convenient. You would think they would be during the day so we had to swim towel-less. On top of this you have to pay for it (and many other add ons).    When we finally went to check in (again after waiting awfully long in the queue) we were taken to our room to only have maintenance paint cans tools and workers in there so we couldn‚Äôt go in. We then had to walk back to reception in the heat go back to the long line (shock) and wait to be reallocated a room. There was little to no sympathy or effort to make the already terrible experience better.    In trying to keep a positive mind frame I thought I‚Äôd give the spa ago which was basically an extended moisturising session with a huge chunk of the time with no massage therapist in the room. Apparently this is part of the experience so that ‚Äúyou can rest‚Äù on your own. So you‚Äôre basically paying to have an empty room-complete waste of money.    The food is average at best and has given quite a few people the terrible stomachs and diarrhoea.    Despite the good deal- save your money folks. There are plenty of decent places that actually have good service and have decent food elsewhere.    You‚Äôll thank me in the long run.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ksarahf

Food roomscleanliness and entertainments team were all excellent and great value for money. The hotel is outside Marrakech but the hotel provide transport into the city if you want to have a look around- recommend the half day tour.Evening music does go on until midnight so if you want to go to bed earlier take some earplugs.Plenty of shampoo and shower gel but no conditioner but you also get body lotion.Would definitely recommend this hotel even for a short 4/5 day break and the hammam in the spa is a must! even the spa does discount for cash well worth a visit .,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Safari52798663427

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Carmen G wrote a review May 2019,40,Lovely Hotel - Though requires more staff and some smiles to give it that 5 *,Arrived home this week after a Fantastic Holiday in Marrakesh. The hotel was lovely - well laid out and beautiful gardens and 2 lovely pools.  We had a superior room which was very spacious  modern and great Air con. Huge bath separate toilet and huge shower. Room cleaned daily  Despite the food being roughly the same everyday lunch and dinner - i did thoroughly enjoy the food. Plenty of meats and seafood and tasty  Entertainment was every night and not the greatest for a 5* hotel and there were only  enough seats outside to sit around 40 people. ( there are 212 rooms at the hotel )  Ways where management could improve and make this the 5* it deserves is recruit more staff on the bars and in the dining hall and rethink the outdoor seating plan  One member of staff per bar is not sufficient and with other nations that Don't Queue caused many unnecessary altercations with other guests. This affected the snack bar pool bar Lobby bar and Dining Hall. No wonder the staff couldn't smile in these areas.  Sports Bar I enjoyed for a great cocktail by Mochine. Great guy thank you .  The hotel runs a shuttle bus which is handy as its about 20 mins in a bus from the Centre. Run fairly regularly.  Tip for Marrakesh - a map doesn't work. If you want to sight see there is a stop and start open top bus that stops right where you are dropped off. Or find someone in a decent restaurant or policeman for directions.  Take plenty of sun cream hat and mosquito spray  We went with Tui ( though we never saw a rep so all trips were booked on the app) I recommend the trip to Essaouira and Atlas Mountains  Overall great holiday and great Hotel though need to recuit more staff  One thing i will say if you have an early flight you can not check in until 3pm and you will also need to pay 600 dir deposit and 200 dir each for a towel. Pay in cash as you will get this back on check out .  Enjoy !!

The staff on the reception are very friendly and helpful. Beds are comfortable we slept really well. Wifi can be accessed almost everywhere in the hotel which is great.    The food is okay not great. And there are lots of flies in the dining room. Unfortunately the restaurant  and bars seem to be quite understaffed and so it can be a bit manic in the dining room trying to get cutlery or drinks.    It's difficult to get drinks at the pool bar as there is only 1 person there all day - he is doing his best but there are lots of people to serve.    Cocktails are hit and miss - mostly they are from a bottle. Very occasionally in the lounge bar they might be made and these are delicious. But these are the exception not the rule. Rose wine very nice.    Sports bar really fun and staff are fab but there is no air conditioning and so you can expect to be bitten by insects if you are in there longer than 5 minutes.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,elainexjx wrote a review May 2019,50,Amazing/ rayieat haqana,So I have just returned from a girly week away with friends but my second time in Morrocco    I can honestly say this hotel surpassed my expectations.    The entertainment team are excellent especially Titif and Simo.The guys are full of energy and try and get everyone involved! You can see they really love what they do.    I didn‚Äôt expect there to be so much variety and activities all day for a Adults Only hotel and there is Defo something for everyone. The activities ranged from pool aerobics archery Zumba yoga and Arabic lessons just to name a few.    I had a an Arabic lesson with Titif he was so patient and wrote everything down he had taught me. Such a great teacher and very intelligent hubun kthyr.    The evening entertainment is equally as good and some nights I didn‚Äôt want to leave they had a cocktail hour karaoke night live bands Brazilian dancers üíÉ etc    For those who want some quiet time there is a quiet pool with a swim up bar and an equally great size pool! I tried it but it wasn‚Äôt my thing far too quiet.    The hotel is spotless and well looked after the gardens and grounds are so pretty so if your all about the insta photo you‚Äôll Defo love it here.    The rooms are a great size and again well looked after we didn‚Äôt have a kettle iron or ironing board but all we needed to do was ask and they were there in seconds. I would have expected them to be there as standard but there was no hassle so it was fine.    Younis the hotel tour operator is excellent and again nothing is too much to ask he will sort absolutely anything out for you. I had quite a bad cold and he went to the pharmacy to get me some cold relief such a star‚≠êÔ∏è.    The spa is amazing and not normally my thing I had a traditional sauna and scrub defo worth it if your a sun worshipper like me. I‚Äôve never felt so relaxed in my life.    The food is good plenty of choice and it didn‚Äôt seem as though food was being recycled like it normally is in all inclusive. I was with a vegetarian and if she‚Äôs happy then it must be ok! I tended to stick to the freshly cooked meat and fish only because I like my food piping hot. There are omelettes fried and poached eggs available for breakfast again a lot of choices in fruit yogurts crepes etc they also do morrocan meals so if your feeling adventurous then give it a try. Again the staff in the restaurant kitchen and bar are great.    The pool bar serves food also so you can pick up a quick snack between 10 - 6 obviously the menu doesn‚Äôt change but there is plenty of choice and the food is nice.    Yes it‚Äôs a 5 star but they could do with some help as somethings need to be changed and improved slightly. Nothing that would massively effect your stay.    I don‚Äôt believe the issues are down to the staff but the the owners and management.The bar service is quite slow and they don‚Äôt offer pool service or a stocked fridge in the room. They really need a new supply of glassware as they would often glass collect wash them then serve your drink. Give me a week there in charge and I‚Äôd make them the 5 Star they deserve and say they are.    I would highly recommend this hotel and would even go as far to say I‚Äôd go back for some winter sun.    shukraan lak laqad qadayt waqtaan rayieaan.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Leeds, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elainexjx

The room itself was spacious with a super king bed and the deepest mattress I have ever seen. Flat screen TV on the wall with other amenities such as tea/coffee/water/fridge/safe. There was a big window between the bedroom and bathroom reduced privacy but the bathroom was lovely with a big walk in shower and a bath. Hairdryer and sachet gels left every day and the body lotion was lush! Drinks in glasses with lots of choice were delivered by the lovely waiters nuts olives placed on your table after 5pm. Food I was a let down we didn‚Äôt find much to our taste and the al a cart was dreadful. The pools were lovely and the pool staff were exceptional. Snacks were always made fresh to order and served to you. Loads of sun beds with towels on a deposit. All inclusive was a good deal here as you are 30mins away from the medina.

Strangely the aircon is controlled from a central point eg it only pumped out warm air as apparently they hadn‚Äôt yet switched to the summer season cooling setting ..most odd !

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,LJPentecost wrote a review Apr 2019,30,My expectations were too high.,Let me start with a few negatives but please continue to read as the overall experience was still fairly positive.    Firstly this hotel may tick the required boxes to be a 5 Star resort but that is where the similarities end. It is a high quality hotel when considering room decor and an overall high standard aesthetically but there are flaws.    Some of the staff have been seriously let down by the management when it comes to training the snack bar at the pool is the worst service I have ever experienced the area is generally clean and tidy and the food is of good standard but the staff are either untrained or inexperienced. It can take up to half an hour to get food during quiet periods and it‚Äôs hit or miss whether drinks will arrive before the the food after the food or even at all. We ate here 3 out of 7 days and experienced the same headless chicken approach every time whilst hoping the previous experience was a one off seeing others suffer the same frustration gave us some peace of mind that there was some consistency and we we not the only victims.    The main restaurant offers nice fresh food for lunch and dinner although it‚Äôs a bit samey salad veg rice pasta pizza and fresh meats or fish. It‚Äôs a bun fight so get there early if you want a relaxing meal. Breakfast is the best meal of the day so don‚Äôt lie in the poached eggs are to die for.    There is defiantly a lack of staff or lack of interested staff within the resort getting served in the lobby bar can be a nightmare the staff plod along and have no idea who is next in line so frustration will get to you. Try and get a seat and order to your table the waiting staff in the lobby bar are by far the best employees they have and should be promoted to train the less capable.    Evening entertainment was relaxing in the lobby bar with live singing.    The animation team around the main pool are eager to please and if you want to take part in the activities they will make you very welcome.    If you like sports they have a sports bar at your disposal unfortunately or not it was closed for 3 days during our visit due to some sewage problems watching the footy in an establishment that smells somewhere between a wet dog and human sick was an unpleasant experience but hopefully this has now been resolved.    It‚Äôs my third trip to Marrakech for a sunny relaxing break and if I do decide to return it won‚Äôt be to this hotel if your not necessarily looking for adults only try the Tikida Palmeraie along the road. Far less stressful in my experience.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Kettering, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LJPentecost

Check-in process was smooth we arrived by 11:30am so waited until early afternoon for our room which wasn‚Äôt a problem as we could use all facilities and the sun was shining! Food was great lots of choice and many traditional Moroccan dishes to try. You also get one opportunity during your stay to dine at the √† la carte Restaurant which we did on the last night which I would also recommend that you do.

The room was cleaned everyday and the bed was lovely to sleep in.    The only negative thing I would say is the fact that the pool with the bar in it is classed as the ""relaxing pool"" so you have to be quiet around there which makes no sense as you'll be drinking in the pool being loud and having a laugh with other visitors on holiday themselves. Other than that it was a superb hotel that I would recommend to anyone.",Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Voyage29170043071

We have a swim up room which is excellent the bed is comfy room is clean and modern. I am a vegetarin and normally struggle at All Inclusive resorts but the food is excellent.  Now my few small comments to improve the Sports Bar does have a very strange smell to it. Drains maybe? This bar my husband thinks is wonderful extra large tv screens with good quality picture. 1st time he has been anywhere and been able to watch his team without a problem.  The bars are constantly running out of glasses.  My small recommemdations to improve this lovely hotel. A few soft drinks in the fridge in the bedroom.  Yesterday it rained. The lobby bar is very small. So not many people can fit in. And sitting outside under the small covered area was cold and damp. And is also cold in the evening. The restaurant has patio heaters why doesnt the bar? Also why dont you keep the snack bar open till 9 just for drinks and with patio heaters.. This is a lovely area to sit  will add more seating area.  Maybe offer waiter sevice around the pool.    We do love this hotel. Lovely laid back atmoshere chilled out feel to it.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Danny B wrote a review Apr 2019,40,Great Hotel For A Couples Week Away!,We have just spent an great week at the Be Live Collection in Marrakech. From the moment we got to the hotel and were greeted with mint tea and biscuits we have found the whole experience brilliant. The whole hotel is always immaculate and the staff are generally great. They are all very friendly and happy to help you but then also leave you alone enough to enjoy the beautiful spaces.    The free shuttle bus stops very close to the main souks and centre of the the city. It‚Äôs perfect for spending the day in town then coming back at night.    I would like to advise you that there is a deposit of around 600 dirham per room and 200 dirham per pool towel that is asked for when you arrive. I may have missed this however I didn‚Äôt see this anywhere on the website of booking documents. This works about at around ¬£80 (which obviously you get back when you leave). However I would also advise that the international transfer bank into your account takes up to 28 days therefore try and use cash and then convert the money back at the airport otherwise you will be like me and have to wait for almost a month for the money back.    I do have a couple points that they could improve on in my opinion. The first would be the service at the snack bar. The food that they served was good however it takes a while to be served and a while to get the food. The portion sizes were also on the small size for a late breakfast that I had (half a slice of toast which was cold when I got it).    The second is regarding the leaving day. We were collected at 7am by Thomas Cook for our 11am flight which was fine however the buffet breakfast doesn't open until 7am. When I asked the reception team about this I was advised to ask the transfer bus to wait until I had breakfast... Clearly this wasn't an option therefore I asked the restaurant manager who advised there is no way we could have any food before we left. Therefore I had to take some fruit as an alternative. This was frustrating baring in mind I had booked all inclusive.    Overall its a really nice hotel that is close enough for you to get into the city when/if you wanted. Yet far enough away for it not to have the busy city hustle and bustle.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Selby, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z4943XZdannyb

It was great to have our own pool off our terrace. The general pool areas and bars are lovey and kept really clean.    The room itself was really spacious with plenty of room and storage. An easy to use safe made life a lot easier! And again the cleaning service received was incredible.    On my birthday they made a real fuss decorating our room and send me a cake with candles. It made the day really special.    Food was nice with a good variety each evening. The snack bar is great for lunch and late breakfast if you don‚Äôt make the 10am cut off in the main restaurant.

It is a very well maintained hotel and the staff go out of their way to make your stay. There were numerous activities throughout the day and the spa service was fantastic although the pool wasn‚Äôt heated in my opinion. I stayed in a superior pool view room which was on the ground floor it was spacious and spotlessly clean my only gripe was that there were no towel hooks so we had to hang our towels over the doors. There were so many options to eat including so many vegan and veggie options. Considering that the wine is poured freely and constantly i didn‚Äôt expect it to be great but it was actually quite nice although sometimes served to you in a martini or brandy glass which was an experience. For me this was not the most Luxurious 5 star hotel but the things it lacked were unimportant as my priority was to relax and have a good time which is exactly what I was able to do.

Hotel is very clean staff are helpful and food is quite good. Our hotel room although of a good standard did not have a bath and the shower did not drain hence every time used flooded into the main bedroom We did raise this with reception but the problem was ongoing. The buffet restaurant is of a good standard for a limited stay but could become repetitive if staying for any length of time. The Moroccan restaurant is overpriced and not worth a visit. All our party came out hungry after the set menu. The outside facilities and the gym are very good although the pool was cold but this was expected at the time of our visit. Hotel is set in the middle of no where so making it difficult to go offsite unless transport is booked.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,BillericayHammer wrote a review Apr 2019,50,Excellent,My wife and I stayed here for my 50th birthday celebration and had a wonderful week.  The hotel is new and is kept absolutely spotlessly clean. The rooms gardens and communal spaces are always being tender to so you get that feeling of being in a very special place.  I see that some reviews have had bad experiences with the staff but I can only relate our experience which was that they were excellent. Especially the waiters in the restaurant who worked incredibly hard and were always friendly and helpful.  The food was excellent. Usual AI buffet style but a huge variety and everything tasted great. I particularly loved the lamb and my wife the fresh vegetables.  The drink was again standard AI local stuff but was fine. We tried the white and rose wines and they were perfectly OK and I had both the local and San Miguel beers.  One word on location : be aware that this hotel is set way out of town and essentially there is nothing around it. So if you are thinking you can walk anywhere then you will be disappointed. Having said that the hotel runs an excellent free shuttle bus into town around 5 times a day. We used that and it worked out great.  The entertainment : we did not get involved in the entertainment during the day as we just wanted to relax but people seemed to be enjoying it. The evening entertainment around the bar was actually pretty good. A coupe of the bands and singers they had to were excellent.  Regarding the 'swim up' rooms..... This is a bit of a misnomer. What you have is a narrow channel of a pool outside your room. The sunbeds are sat in an inch or so of water and you can plunge into the deeper part to cool off whenever you want. So whilst the name is perhaps a bit wrong we did really enjoy having that option.  Only criticism I could really have is that very occasionally there was a bit of a wait for a drink at the bar in the evening and this is an area I think the management could help the staff out with. One they can increase the number of staff and Two they could give them more glasses which they often seemed to run out of! But this is a very minor quibble. You're on holiday so chill out and wait for your drink you're not on the clock!  Overall a great experience and we would jump at the chance to go back.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Billericay, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BillericayHammer

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Scott Vincent wrote a review Apr 2019,30,Airconditioning or heating,before i rant about the airconditioning its partly my own fault as its happened before to me in Marrakech and i must have just forgot. This was a last minute decision to book on the Sunday before we flew on Friday. Just wanted something hot and a short flight for seven days. This was tipped as a five star hotel in the Tui collection and after checking there own web site it looked pretty good and offered everywere airconditioned rooms which is a necessity for me as i sleep terrible in hot places. When we arrived our Junior suite was pretty nice amazing lounge area and sizable bedroom with extensive second floor balcony. really happy. Checked in got changed left the aircon on 18 and left to sunbath. You can imagine our horror when we got back and the room was 28 deg that was about 3 more than we had been sunbathing.  Long story short they dont switch the airconditioning on until the end of April irrelevant of how hot it is outside. FYI it was about 25-26.  When i challenged them at reception they said no one else had complained and as it was winter they couldent do anything. We thought it strange no one would say anything and it was only when we chatted with people around the pool did we realise everyone had been complaining.  If you are staying between October and April its worth checking about the aircon.  As it was all inclusive its worth mentioning the food offering is pretty limited with only one main restaurant for breakfast lunch and dinner and a secondary restaurant they use for a Moroccan experiance.  The main restuarant is a bit bland and badly designed with the staff having to push past you while they take plates back to the kitchen.  In order of service i would only give breakfast 2/5 with Lunch and dinner 3/5. most of the hot dishes on Lunch and dinner are mostly Tangine and for whatever reason were super dry nothing like we experianced in the medina restaurants. Lots of fishe dishes at night but again really dry no sauce. The Moroccan experiance which according to the hotel you can only book once was the most disapointing again super dry and bland. In fairness i did see people eating burger and chips at the pool every day and they looked satisfied.  The bar in the evening was great way to relax and the bar manager never stopped all night with his cocktails.  Finally the spa which was another reason to book a good hotel was perhaps the worst i have encountered. The very first day we arrived in the morning i tried to book a massage for the evening. The place was empty and i could not get any of the young staff to confirm if they could do it all they would say was can you come back another time. In the end i took a taxi up to the Medina and booked a Hammam. 250 dhms which was more than half price what it was at the hotel.

Hotel had a lovely atmosphere as it's small enough to get to interact with your fellow guests but big enough to chill too.    Special mention must be made to praise Simo and Abdessamad. Simo leads the entertainment team and strikes the right balance between encouraging people to participate and not being too intrusive. Abdessamad in the restaurant is the most attentive waiter and remembered our drinks preferences whether at breakfast or dinner.    Our first night was spent in room 5002 which appeared to be a disabled access room as it had a walk in shower and open plan WC with no bath. We had to be moved as the bathroom was poorly designed with the shower drain being at the highest point and therefore the bathroom was under 2"" of water with no chance of it draining away. No debate over moving rooms as I suspect it was a known issue. Room 5003 was lovely this time with a huge bath and separate shower cubicle and enclosed WC. We had asked for a quiet room but the superior rooms are sited opposite the sports bar which is open to 1am. We like to sleep with the terrace door ajar so we had a little noise but it wasn't too bad as the hotel was only half full. At full capacity/high season I think this would be a different story.    We had wet weather during our stay which meant that the bar seating was full with long queues at the bar. There was only ever one bartender on duty which we felt was a way of managing consumption so we just doubled our order! If you were lucky you could catch the eye of the waiter who would take your order and return after quite a delay with your drinks often with nuts and olives. Evening entertainment was good with the usual singers dancers etc.    The spa is a great facility most useful during the wet weather. We each enjoyed a massage which was reasonably priced.    Being away from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech is a bonus. The shuttle bus in and out was easy and we had no problem reserving seats although others weren't so lucky.    I would definitely stay at the Be Live chain again but probably wouldn't return to Marrakech as we generally like to visit new destinations each time.    All in all a lovely holiday made special by meeting interesting people and being looked after so well.",Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Suffolk, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/micheller632019
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Susan Cook wrote a review Apr 2019,50,Well worth a visit....,This was an awesome week meeting loads of new people and having a great time.  The room was very comfortable with large queen size bed large shower and very spacious. The place is very clean and constantly being maintained by staff.  Food was always available either from the buffet where there was a choice for everyone or the snack bar if people wanted the convenience type food such as pizza. The drinks were fast and flowing with a range of cocktails for you to try or the simple beer.  What can I say about the entertainment team (Simo Titfi Fati and Salim) as well as my husband and I staying up every night until 1am in the bar with the live music or the belly dancers I was then up at 10am for the yoga archery salsa dancing and twice daily aqua aerobics in the heated pool. We also under took an Arabic lesson and played mini golf. There was lots for us to do. So if you want to join in go for it. Thank you Team!  There are two pools one heated and one unfortunately not but it does have a swim up bar which is a nice feature. There is a spa which I did not visit this time but would do if we visit again.  Outside of the complex we visited the Souks (local markets) which was an experience not to be missed.  This hotel and complex is well worth a visit and there was nothing to complain about. Great job by all including the entertainment team the bar staff and caterers.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cooks1409
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Sammy E wrote a review Apr 2019,50,Extra Special Honeymoon,Me and my Husband have just returned home from this hotel and we have not one bad word to say about this place.  Our stay was incrediable from start to finish.  I could pick out some faults but they are such small things that it‚Äôs not even worth going into.    Our room was brilliant on arrival we were greeted with rose petals in the shape of a heart on our bed. This was lovely as we weren‚Äôt expecting any kind of anything special for our Honeymoon. The bed is so so soft we struggled to get out of it in time for breakfast.  The ONLY thing I would suggest is tea and coffee making facilities in the room - that would be a huge bonus!    The food - it was never bad. But I did struggle as I am more of a plain and simple girl. There was a huge range of starters mains and desserts. It seems previous reviews saying the food was bland has hit a nerve with the chefs as that certainly is not the case now. There was also copious amounts of fruit and vegetables. Enough to suit all pallets.    The staff - where do I start?  Simo is awesome. Always smiling and says hello to everyone he passes. Very charming young man who is constantly on the move and full of energy. He joined us for lunch on our last day and we were facisnated listening to him telling us about his life.    Titif is also awesome he is also always smiling and greeting everyone. He set up the Archery course for us on Thursday (bad weather day) and joined the team I was on - we had an amazing time and thanks to him our team won! He also showed me and my husband a few card tricks which we will be showing to our children. We showed him some of the card games we played so he can pass on these games to other guests.    All in all we had a brilliant time. We met some amazing people who we will keep in contact with - something we don‚Äôt nornally do but this hotel brings everyone together and you end up forming friendships throughout your stay.    Hopefully in the future we will have the opportunity to stay here again and we would do so without any hesitation.    Thanks again to ALL the staff I wish I could mention you all but I would be here forever.    See you all soon.

Nice bath and shower . A few English channels on TV . Only water in the fridge unless you upgrade to a package of fridge drinks  Two pools one heated with music and aqua aerobics . One quiet with a swim up bar but to cold when we went at the end of march .  The entertainment was low key .Not big shows . Small dance troop .Duos and small groups .  The drinks from the bars were of good quality and often bottled mixers . Bottled beers available in the sports bar and swim up bar . A pool table .TV and bar games were in the sports bar and late night snacks open until one .  The food was good and a fair amount of choice for a small hotel . The only problem as with most Buffet restaurants was the food being only warm or cold . The cakes fruit ice cream are great  Overall I would recommend and I would return for a weeks chill out .,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Geordieland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keithliz
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,RyanD23 wrote a review Apr 2019,30,Ok.... But not 5*,If you look back on my past reviews it‚Äôs very rare that I‚Äôll write anything negative but I think this hotel has to brush up on a few things.    The Spa is by far the best thing about this hotel for the rest I‚Äôm going to try and break this hotel down there‚Äôs some good and some bad    Amazing -    - The Spa is unbelievable ¬£170pp for 5-6 hours of massages and treatments per person    Good -    - Most Staff  - Very Clean and nice Rooms (great shower)  - Service  - Value for money (¬£440pp for 4 nights including flights and transfers)  - The Hotel grounds (looks great & very clean)  - Food was good and had a fair bit of variety some bad bits    Being picky -    - Alcohol not sold at the sports bar during the day and most of the evening even when big football matches were being shown. You had to walk 40 yards to get a beer. So not ideal    - No tea or coffee facilities in the rooms (only water in a small fridge)    - You can‚Äôt buy any drinks at the shop to take to your room    Bad -    - Reception staff didn‚Äôt come across great everything appeared to be hard work.    - No Air-conditioning in the room as it‚Äôs classed as out of season despite being 26c  We were ready to leave the first night because it was so hot.  We didn‚Äôt eventually get moved to a room with a breeze but then introduced the bugs as we had to have the door open all the time - however I would put this down to TUI for not giving any indication that this is a seasonal thing.    - Lumps in the milk a few times not great for your morning coffee    - A few things undercooked where they were trying to rush to keep the food consistent on the trays    - Quite slow with the drinks at meal times    Onto TUI -    What a terrible company from the moment you make the payment.    Trying to book seats online after paying was a nightmare  We booked and paid for exit seats but then only had that option on the way back even then we were seated separately.  Then the issue with the air-con - I phoned them on the first day they said they will call me back straight away then I didn‚Äôt hear from them for the duration of the trip  Complete Joke    Overall Ok,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Reading, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Derman23

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,GC62 wrote a review Mar 2019,30,"Winter Sun, Be Live Collection Marrakech March 2019",Just returned from a great weeks winter sun & would like to state that I spoke to guest relations during our stay & are aware of the following comments.  We arrived to a very warm welcome reception team who explained all amenities at the hotel & suggested that we took lunch or a drink at the Lobby or Pool bars as our rooms would be available at 2pm (we arrived at 12noon) this we did enjoying the surroundings of the pool along with a refreshing drink.  Staff:  All the staff at the hotel can't do enough for you & you are always greeted with warm smile.  Accommodation:  The rooms are fresh clean with a sumptuous bed  we had a ground floor room with terrace which was lovely. Large bathroom with separate shower  toilet twin basins & a huge bath.The rooms are cleaned daily to a very high standard.  Pool:  We stayed around the main pool out of the two pools where there are plenty of sun beds umbrellas & doubled covered loungers. Daily entertainment included water aerobics  darts stretching & archery to name just a few things to do if you want pool side.  Bars & Restaurant:  This is where the hotel requires some attention & as already mentioned I have spoken with the hotel about while staying so they are aware.  Food:  There is plenty of choice of food in the main restaurant the only issue we found was that the food was being prepared far to soon & was either warm or cold. Most days there was lack of dinner plates bowls side plates & dessert spoons. this can be simply resolved by ensuring that one of the many kitchen staff was responsible for checking these to ensure that nothing ran out during service.  Bars:  On three seperate occasions the Sports bar ran out of Beer Rum & Gin on another the pool bar ran out of clean plastic tumblers & at another time the Lobby bar ran out of high ball tumblers serving Mojitos in Whiskey tumblers.    Now these are really silly things that should never happen once is a mistake on multiple occasions its a habit!    We have stayed at A/I 5* hotels in the past with the restaurant & bar service being far superior than what we received at the Be Live Collection Marrakech but saying all this we had a great week & WOULD return hopefully seeing these silly issues resolved as I have been ensured by guest relations!,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garycushnie

The food in the restaurant was ok so I would suggest eating at the snack bar for lunch as the buffet is the same food for lunch and dinner.  The rooms were hot as the air con isn‚Äôt switched on till June so after complaining twice and asking for a fan I just gave up.  The pool temperature for the swim up bar was freezing so we didn‚Äôt use that bar unless it was for hot chocolate to warm us up after the swim üòÇ  We had a swim up room but was a waste of money as the water was painfully cold and should have been called ‚Äúpaddle up room‚Äù as the water comes up to my knees and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8.

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel nor to stay here again.    The hotel is all-inclusive and adults only although there is a sister hotel which caters for families - the choice is yours.

Exceptionally clean in all areas;swim-up room well worth the upgrade. All the entertainment staff during the day were truly wonderful and really made the holiday especially for my disabled adult son.Good entertainment at night although I can imagine the bar area would not be big enough to accommodate all guests when hotel full. The main restaurant food was varied and of a high standard...a special mention here to our waiter Mouhad whose service was excellent. I have to say that all staff were friendly courteous and helpful. We did hear some negative feedback about the a la carte restaurant and we decided not to try for ourselves...there is certainly enough choice in the main one anyway with different themed nights.

This guy was by far the best member of staff I‚Äôve ever encountered in a hotel.... absolutely amazing and always smiling... great kid!    To keep it simple.... here‚Äôs the hotels pros and cons....    Good  Clean rooms  Lovely bathroom  All amenities are pretty close - nicely designed hotel  Decent pool very clean and good beds and free cabanas  Staff were incredible could never do enough  Selection of food was strong good mixture and some very healthy meals.  Entertainment team and night entertainment (on occasionally days were brilliant... the band with the short guy and black girl sorry can‚Äôt remember names... top quality they were!)  Wifi actually really good throughout all rooms and parts of hotel.    Bad.... or should I say suggestions...    Sports bar opening times only open from late... needs to be open more frequently so we can play pool and table football etc. Although staff did open at times for football so all was good.    No Coffee machine in room I would expect this as a minimum.... love a coffee in bed before going for breakfast. Have got drinks self service at breakfast too with an option for paper cups to take away.    Need to have self service soft drinks / water often waiting at the bar for ages just for water or a soft drink! Why not make these self service so the wait at the bar is much reduced.    Shop incredibly expensive ¬£20 for a small bottle of sun cream was reduce koi‚Äôs but of course nowhere else to go. Also was very little snacks or drinks you could buy... I know it‚Äôs all inclusive but sometimes nice to chill in room with snacks    Selected Singer - couple of the nights had a miserable singer on depressing everyone. Killed the mood and room emptied quickly.... people want upbeat and to have fun.    Overall though a brilliant hotel with fantastic staff.

Initially we were told by Thomas Cook we‚Äôd get a room upgrade for my birthday when we arrived hotel didn‚Äôt have any knowledge of it. Not the hotels fault if was just our awful Thomas Cook holiday rep who was no where to be seen for 10 nights. All of the reception staff were friendly and always helpful when we needed something. They also helped my partner decorate our room on my birthday and bought us a cheesecake etc it was beautiful.    Our room was always spotless the cleaners kept it immaculate. As long as we remembered put our dirty towels in the bath we had fresh ones each day.    The food was fresh daily never had any problems with it. Breakfast is repetitive but lunch and dinner does change most days.    Lobby bar and sports bar staff were always super friendly and couldn‚Äôt do enough for us Azdine Yanis Youness ayoun and Mouhcine (we didn‚Äôt get everyone‚Äôs names sorry!) were always smiling and continued to refill our drinks throughout our time at the lobby bar day or night.    Entertainment was always different of an evening and a special mention to Simo and Salim who worked super hard to engage the guests into activities both day and night. Simo worked so hard and deserves massive credit. On another note; Fati wasn‚Äôt helpful I do feel that she leaves Simo to do everything whilst she just relaxes in the towel hut. A couple of times I went to change my towels and she was just relaxing on her phone leaving other entertainers to do all the work. Doesn‚Äôt seem fair on the other stagf.    The shuttle bus from hotel into town is frequent and the pick up/drop off point is easy to get to. If you get a taxi it‚Äôs 100 dirham before 8pm and 150dirham after 8pm. There is nothing close by to the hotel so you can‚Äôt walk anywhere outside of the resort. We booked all of our trips through the lovely man in the hotel lobby he is helpful and all our trips went smoothly with no issues!    Only one issue is that there was no air con in the rooms and if was 32 degrees on some days.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,yousaf wrote a review Mar 2019,50,amazing holiday,We travelled as a group of 4 friends and booked via Tui to the Be Live Collection Adults Only in Marrakech and I must say it was awesome.    It is a big resort with plenty of outdoor space. Peaceful and relaxing.    The hotel is situated in a standalone plot about 20 minutes drive from central Marrakech. It runs a free shuttle bus back and forth five times a day but you are asked to pre-book your seat the day before.    The resort is beautifully done with landscaped gardens it is spotlessly clean throughout has huge rooms and is tastefully decorated. Rooms have a safe where you can keep your valuables and documents and you can change currency at the reception. Exchange rate is a little lower than you would get in town but saves a lot of hassle.    There are two pools one which is heated and in and around which many of the activities take place throughout the day and a second pool which is unheated.    There are many activities organised throughout the day all free and all very well run by the entertainment team run by Simo and his team Karim Salim Fati and Titif who were very good at their jobs and a pleasure to meet.    We were very pleasantly surprised by the variety range and quality of the food on offer at the main buffet.    There was a pleasant mix of nationalities and age groups at the resort and we feel it offered something for everyone.    There was also varied entertainment in the evenings at the lobby bar.    We used the lobby bar pool bar and snack bar and found the service was always friendly. We were very impressed with the staff as a whole but must give a mention to Ayoub at the pool bar and Mohcine and Yassin at the lobby bar.    There is also a sports bar open till 1am where you can get drinks and snacks.    The gardeners and the housekeeping team were always on the go and were doing a great job.    We must also mention Mounia the manager who was absolutely brilliant as we had some minor issues which she resolved quickly. She even arranged for breakfast to be sent to our rooms the evening before we went out on an early 7am excursion to the Atlas Mountains.    And lastly the TUI rep Sara Jane who met us at the airport when we landed and was always there and who helped us with all the information we needed and who booked our 4 days of excursions for us a great big thank you.    To summarise we felt this resort met all our needs perfectly after a stressful few months at work we needed a getaway and it was a perfect balance of relaxing at the resort and getting out there to see the culture meet the people see the architecture and learn some history. It met and exceeded all our hopes and expectations.    The staff definitely make all the difference at this resort to make it what it is as they clearly have worked so hard to achieve and maintain these standards. We would definitely return to this resort.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sixways

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Mel P wrote a review Mar 2019,50,A overall fabulous holiday,We had a thoroughly enjoyable weeks stay in March.  Cleanliness is noticeable rooms cleaned daily. Like that there is a system that encourages you to be environmentally friendly ie placing towels in the bath that need changing.  Fresh water replenished daily.  Massive bed and very comfortable as were the pillows.  Not usually one for entertainment teams I did however find the team here to be more respectful if you choose not to participate but encouraging you to engage all the same in a very pleasant manner. A good range of activities.  Used the gym daily and really very adequate. The main pool was heated sufficiently to swim.  We also accessed the ‚Äòquiet pool‚Äô which we found very relaxing.  Service in all areas was good and certainly no complaints.  Food was above standard stayed in a number of all inclusives and this goes into the top ten list. Good choice and quality of foods. Can you believe no chips for a whole week less you ate from the snack bar. Lovely selection of fruits and range of options at breakfast was impressive. Alcohol drinks very pleasant.  We used the bus service Into Marrakesh which was faultless. As stated in reviews there is nothing local we went fri a relaxing week away and this was not an issue for us. Taxi‚Äôs are available and very reasonably priced  Money exchange and ATM in the hotel.  Really couldn‚Äôt find anything to fault highly recommend and would certainly consider again may also look at the be live options in other countries.,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Shropshire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/85melp
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Daydream01341558707 wrote a review Mar 2019,40,Great resort...but open the sports bar!!!,We enjoyed our stay here In March. It was clean and the food was great. Plenty of sunbeds! Lovely pool. Special thanks to Laila who greeted us with a big smile and coffee every morning and to Hassan who looked after us In the evenings keeping our glasses filled with delicious ros√© wine. Our main critisism is that the sports bar wasnt open for us to play pool or catch up on the football until 10pm which is just too late. When they did open earlier on occasions the bar wasnt open so we had to keeping going back to the snack bar everytime we needed a drink. We were unfortunate to have a full day of heavy rain and it was clear they werent set up for this. They eventually opened the sports bar so we had something to do but they had to close the snack bar instead. We would probably go back even though its quite a way out from the centre and there is nothing else around!

The entertainment team went above and beyond and even had me joining in at aqua aerobics which is unusual for me! The pool area was lovely with delightful gardens. The whole hotel has a very relaxed and luxurious feel and is spotlessly clean and well laid out. We stopped in a suite with beautiful views of the sunset from the balcony. There is a wide selection of food choices from the restaurant which was a pleasant surprise for all inclusive plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables delicious deserts and good beer and wine. The entertainment in the bar area was ok. Youness behind the bar made the best Mojitos ! We had a spa treatment which was amazing you can get a cheaper deal if you pay cash and it was very reasonably priced compared to the UK. The cash machine in reception is quite temperamental - select the French option and ask one of the staff to help you as we tried 3 times to get cash before it finally worked!

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,JK wrote a review Mar 2019,40,A Lovely few days,We stayed here for four nights. We read some bad reviews about this place before we left. But from the moment we arrived at the hotel the staff were very nice helpful and friendly. Our room was spotless and the hotel itself was very well looked after. The staff would organise activates at one of the pools every day optional to take part but we thought it was good fun and a great way to mingle with the over guests. There was another pool which looked to be quieter for those looking for a bit more peace and quiet. As mentioned there is a free shuttle bus going into Marrakech several times a day from outside the hotel which was very handy (make sure to book in at reception as you need a ticket for the bus).  Overall we found this hotel to be a great place for a few days to relax.  ALL staff were very friendly wouldn‚Äôt like to mention any names but they were lovely to us from the moment we arrived.    The only negative for us was our room had an interconnecting door with the room next door. Most mornings we were woken up by the guests in the other room ‚Äì we could hear a hair dryer and zips opening and closing. The noise insulation was not great and would recommend asking for a room with no interconnecting door.Show less,Date of stay: February 2019,,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MRJJK

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Michelle A wrote a review Mar 2019,30,Honest review of our stay,Still staying here until tomorrow our last day I am always very honest with my reviews  the hotel is very clean modern and new and yes most of the staff are great . However a few issues have disappointed us during our stay  firstly no air conditioning in rooms even though it‚Äôs 32 degrees asked reception why and told marrakech not hot enough yet to switch on  obviously centrally controlled asked for a fan  still waiting .  The food is nice  not a typical 5star choice  good salads  but quite a lot of meat griddled but not cooked properly and fish too raw in the middle .  Also checkout is 12 so later flight in the evening will cost you ¬£100 to keep your room til 6pm  think this is absolutely overpriced stayed in many 5 star resorts around the world never have I been asked to pay this much .  The pools are lovely not deep waist high the main one is heated with entertainment etc but the quiet chill pool with swim up bar is not and is freezing and empty this definitely needs a rethink .  The rooms are fabulous new modern clean  great bathrooms  separate shower  loo bath double sinks and comfortable beds  but the worst sleep all 4 nights as no air con far too hot  and leaving balcony door open you get attacked by mosquitoes.  The other issue we have met is when the hotel is full which it is now meal times are hectic  shortage of staff who are trying so hard to keep tables served  cleaned and waited on  managers stood around doing nothing  I asked a manager for a drink as we had been waiting 15 mins he then asked the waiter to bring it  how sad he couldn‚Äôt help out himself .  Some evenings we have had to wait in the bar for a table as so busy  with 8 couples in front of us .  It‚Äôs a mixed bag of ages here  a lot of golfers  and great to be adult only no children .  There is also no pool service at either pools  which is disappointing.  Personally I wouldn‚Äôt return to the hotel  have stayed in Morocco 26 times and have had much better experiences in other hotels  it was a pleasant 4 day break but could have been better .,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Bath, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michelleaH2297UU

The resort is big enough that there is enough space and enough to do but feels peaceful and intimate.    The rooms are very clean and a great mix of modern and Moroccan the only issue with the room is there is sometimes a drain smell but other than that very pleasant and spacious. I would also advise asking for a room either not on the ground floor or with a garden view as we had a pool view room and did feel quite exposed.    The buffet restaurant is nice and the food is good with lots of variety to suit all tastes and the on site morrocan restaurant is very authentic!    All the staff are very friendly and always make you feel welcome even when they are rushed off their feet! We want to mention Mohcine and Hafid who were especially friendly and attentive!!

We are leaving tomorrow and can honestly say I could stay on for another two weeks. Hotel is beautiful and spacious and sparkles with cleanliness. The food is lovely and the drinks are fabulous. The red wine is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and the bathrooms are stunning. The grounds are beautiful with flowers and shrubs everywhere. Never a shortage of comfortable beds around the pools. But the very best thing about this place is the lovely people who look after your every need. From the room cleaners to the restaurant and bar staff. Every one is so polite and respectful and work very very hard to pander to your every need. Thank you all so much. It‚Äôs a pity the same can‚Äôt be said about some of the guests who on several evenings were just so rude to the staff. Especially the ones turning up in groups of about forty and expecting to be sat together!! How ridiculous!! The poor staff were getting shouted at terribly. It was if these people expected them to make the rest of the guests disappear just to accommodate them because they were in a group!! So sad to see the waiters being treat badly like that. The lovely Simo and the whole entertainment crew work tirelessly to keep you entertained. But if you just want to chill that‚Äôs okay too.

The bartender on the swim up bar is absolutely lovely and always cheerful. In fact we haven't come across one single member of staff who is anything but cheerful and polite. They as most Moroccans we have encountered are happy cheerful people.  The hotel is absolutely beautiful. Very modern but still with a Moroccan vibe. The gardens are lush and exotic even before the roses have bloomed.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Northwest Chinese Golf socitey wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Northwest Chinese golf society,27 of us just got back from a golfing holiday staying in be live collection hotel.. we stay for a week.. hotel was clean.. staff very helpful and friendly a tip a day go a long way so giving 20 dirham (¬£1.80). The only 2 complains I personally would give as I was sharing a double room is that the bathroom has a large window inserted between bathroom and the bedroom and the blinds does not even hide the fact that everything could be view. The reception staff were slow checking in. Food was very good with lots of choices on offer..As the hotel is adults only no kids running around etc...golf wise. the hotel is about 20 minutes from all golf courses. we played first day on' The Montgomerie' the course didn't have enough golf carts to go round our groups so walking from greens to tees were very long some holes being a par 5 walk to the next tee!!!!! The course nothing special if anything each hole look the same layout.so I wouldn't booked there again. The second course 'The Tony Jacklin' was right next door to Montgomerie again nothing special but you still need a golf cart to go round but not as bad as The Montgomerie from greens to tees..The third course 'Al maaden' I personally would play again as it was different set up with views toward the mountain.Last golf course to play was 'Noria ' was out of this world. A truly championship course each hole is difference the 9th and 18th hole with water bang in the middle next to the club house. After golf in Noria few of us gather up in the bar/restaurant area waiting for our group to finish seating next to us were a 4 ball of FRENCH persons whom took it to themselves to tell us to be quiet with one lady screaming at the top of her voice the other lady putting her fingers at her ears. This i may add was rude enough until one of the french lady wanted to take a photo of us this inflame us and a shouting match was had...Nearly came to blows!!! Speaking to bar staff and the pro afterwards the French group in question are known trouble makers.. Anyway beside this the golf holiday was superb.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Placitasgirl wrote a review Mar 2019,40,Pretty Impressed!,"Our search for a relaxing week in some warm winter sunshine led us (via Tui) to the Be Live Collection Adults Only in Marrakech and we've just returned after a 1 week break.    The hotel opened almost a year ago and having read some of the early reviews the first thing that is clear is that the management have worked extremely hard to address some of the recurring issues such as drain smells in rooms poor food rude or disinterested staff and have achieved great things because we simply didn't encounter any of these problems.    The hotel is situated in a standalone plot about 20 minutes drive from central Marrakech. It runs a free shuttle bus back and forth five times a day but you are asked to prebook your seat the day before. The property is beautifully done; landscaped gardens spotlessly clean throughout huge rooms (we took a suite) and tastefully decorated.    There are two pools an ""active"" one which is heated and in and around which many of the activities take place through the day. I joined in the yoga stretch and dance classes as well as the archery sessions and my husband enjoyed refreshing his Arabic at daily sessions too. There are many other activities through the day all free and all very well run by Simo Karim and the team who were very good at their jobs and a pleasure to meet. This pool could get a bit noisy with music on for these sessions and activities going on so after the first day or so we chose to sit around the second pool which is simply beautiful with a swim up pool bar. The pool is unheated but fortunately the water was amazing (26-28c each day) and after a day or so a number of us ventured in to cool down or enjoy a refreshing drink.    This was our first ever AI holiday and we were a bit wary of all buffet food but we were very pleasantly surprised by the variety range and quality of the food on offer at the main buffet and snack bar. The only disappointment was the once per visit dinner at the specialty Moroccan Cuisine restaurant which offers a choice of 2 set menus and table service. The main course on the menu we had chosen was not available and was substituted with a Chicken Tagine which was disappointing as this was a dish always available in the buffet. Our starter (Harira soup) was watery tasteless and contained hard chickpeas. The second course (seven Moroccan salads) was just a plate of mush with the only thing that wasn't bland or over sweet being the spinach. Our main courses arrived and my tagine was terribly overcooked to the point of being almost inedible. The Beef Tanjia also disappointing; bland and tasting only of lemon juice. We've travelled to Morocco on many occasions and I enjoy cooking Moroccan food. We've never had such disappointing dishes and I left the restaurant when the main arrived and ate at the buffet. Such a shame and a real missed opportunity for the resort given how well they do food everywhere else. We weren't the only guests to leave and eat elsewhere or to comment on how disappointed we were.    There was a pleasant mix of nationalities and age groups at the resort and we feel it offered something for everyone. We didn't attend any of the shows in the evening but the feedback from guests who did was very good. We did use the lobby bar pool bar and snack bar and found the drinks good and the Moroccan Ros√© really lovely. Service again was always friendly if a little slow but always delivered with a smile. We were super impressed with the workmate of staff in the buffet who never stopped and the same is true of the gardeners and housekeeping team. Special mention to Sara at the pool bar who despite being 7 months pregnant didn't stop and never stopped smiling. Good luck with the little on Sara!    To summarise we felt this resort met all our needs perfectly; it was a ""fly and flop: week after a stressful few months and the holiday for us wan't about the destination but the resort and it met and exceeded all our hopes and expectations.    If I were to offer any tips I'd say that the rooms at the unheated pool side of the resort are quieter and I wouldn't book a ground floor room; the upper rooms are quieter and more private in my opinion.    We were made aware of the deposit for towels/damages by Tui and also of the fact that the spa was independently run and incurred additional charges for their services and the indoor pool which is located there. The gym is free of charge. The hotel description on the Tui website indicated that it was outside the city but a quick google search would clearly show you it's in an undeveloped area with nothing nearby to walk to.    We would definitely return to the resort. We'd book a suite again and would ask if we could be located on the quieter side again.    I'm impressed by the way the resort has settled into it's skin since opening and that the reviews are now reflecting this which must be really pleasing for the whole team who have clearly worked so hard to achieve and maintain these standards.

Only criticism would be the ¬£100 deposit required upon check-in for towels and the lack of a mini bar in the room just seemed abit odd .,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taniekaf

We booked the suite which was huge with comfortable beds. It had a balcony overlooking the pool and hotel grounds. The room was extremely clean as was the entire hotel even the toilets at the reception were immaculate.    The hotel is all inclusive and the food was wonderful a wide selection to choose from for breakfast lunch and dinner. You can also have burger and chips by the pool just before lunch - be careful of the flies around that particular bar area.    The spa is definitely worth the price you pay- it is quite expensive in comparison to elsewhere but it is 100% worth it the atmosphere and the staff; amazing! I fell asleep during my massage and the hammam left my skin feeling brand new!    The hotel also had a free shuttle bus to the market which was great. There is also free gym access and a sports bar with a massive TV for football the bar also includes board and card games.

Ate in A la Carte restaurant on one night very disappointing. 2 Set menu choices so not a la carte and food not as good as buffet selection. The hotel ran out of tonic water on 3 of the 7 nights that we were there which was very disappointing and not something you would expect from a 5 star hotel.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Kate N wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Great Hotel,Had an excellent 4 night break with my 18 year old son. I tried the gym yoga aqua aerobics and archery and he tried all the cocktails on the bar menu.    Had a suite which was massive: bedroom with very comfortable king size bed fully separated from the sitting room by a sliding door. Only disappointment was the sofa bed wasn‚Äôt the usual type- pull out  type with a double mattress - it was the sofa with bedding added still comfortable enough though.    Excellent food with good range at each meal. Delicious desserts beautifully presented with exquisitely made pastry. Moroccan wine was good each of the cocktails was apparently great.    Spa was large and modern booked a 3 day package. Lovely staff including the 2 Hammam girls Illem and Lattifa and we had great range of massages.    Main pool was warm lovely to be swimming in February looking up at a bright blue cloudless sky.    The evening entertainment was surprisingly good excellent singers. Depending on the mix of guests in the bar people got up and danced some nights.    The clientele seem mixed many stylish French Dutch and Japanese.

Gorgeous bathroom large shower separate bath twin wash basins. Our ground floor room had it's own terrace opposite one of the pools.

Furniture is extremely well chosen. The food is better compared to other hotels in Marrakech!  Mojito at the bar next the restaurant is great.    Only bad thing that I can say is that the rooms are noisy we paid for a nice swim up room which logically results in a groundfloor room... but the noise we have from our upper neighbours is really anoying it s like they are redecorating every morning and they don t use there complete feet to walk but just their heels. It can be bad luck but if you aren t paying for a swim up room i would suggest asking a room on the first floor.

From arrival we were given an absolutely outstanding service. The hotel itself is beautiful pristine and modern. The food was fantastic - I would pay for it in a resturant so to get it at a buffet is exceptional. The staff here are so helpful nothing is too much and our drinks order was always remembered. For the resort being very popular it never seemed overcrowded or busy. We could always find sunloungers at any time of the day. The shuttle bus to town was very handy and the reception is open 24 hours for things like money exchange but there is a cash point in reception to draw out dirham.  As it was our honeymoon on arrival our bed was covered in rose petals and we were given a lovely cheescake. We felt very special.

Live bands at night who were really talented traditional belly dancing archery games. Something for everyone and all for Adults. This actually is an adult only hotel.

Take a kettle as there is not one in the room. It is slightly cool in the mornings or late at night. But a cardigan will be enough. They put heaters on outside at night if you like to sit out. I went in February and no mosquitoes. Sara the Tui rep was always on hand and very helpful. No problem exchanging currency at reception and our room had a free safe.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Stacey wrote a review Feb 2019,40,Great hotel / Beware the Hammam,Me & my boyfriend booked this hotel based on the previous reviews. The food was nice but I found the food a little samey throughout the week and reverted back to either pizza or pasta every night and I am adventurous in trying new foods so that was a little disappointing.    We upgraded to the swim up room the room was lovely and clean and really big! The bathroom was my favourite part as it had a rainfall shower. Many people have complained about the shower flooding but that‚Äôs because they weren‚Äôt careful with the door! If you close it really slowly so water will be pushed out.    As we travelled in December we weren‚Äôt actually able to use the swim up pool as it wasn‚Äôt heated so was Ice cold so wasted my money on that tbh! But if we‚Äôd have gone in the summer months I have no doubt we would have used it daily!    The pool was really clean but only one of them was open unfortunately the one with the swim up bar was closed. Again probably due to the time of year.    The drinks were ok the best cocktails were in the sports bar as they seem to take a little more time making them whereas in the bar inside the hotel they are busy so seem to just throw them together so taste completely different.    The night life on the first night was great they had the normal show on which was in the main bar which got rather cramped (not sure if they do the shows somewhere else when it‚Äôs mega busy?) then they had a DJ on till gone 1am which was ace but every night after that the bar shut at 12 and the sports bar at 1am but there wasn‚Äôt really a night light life tbh. They had singers etc on which were good but it was mostly a sit and chat kind of evening.    The spa ..... we paid for a couples spa experience over 2 days. The spa is simply beautiful and is soooo clean. We had AMAZING hot stone massage that I can‚Äôt recommend highly enough! HOWEVER beware of the Hammam!!! It started with us in a steam room all ok so far we were then taken into a Mable room with 2 marble slabs as I entered one of the women grabbed by bikini top off of me so I was naked on top and then asked if it was ok :/ we were then asked to lay on the slabs they then proceeded to hose us down and then vigorously rub creams and salts into our skin (even my breasts) we were asked to flip over several times which on a Mable slab when wet is rather difficult and VERY unflattering!!! They spoke in their language the whole way though which I found rude and not relaxing at all. We were then hosed for a final time given a robe and then ushered into the pool area (I was still topless) so had to stand in the corner to try and put my top back on. DAY 2 of the Hammam same drill HOWEVER I knew was was coming with the top being off so I opted for a swim suit which I would have to pull down myself. I‚Äôm not sure if this annoyed her that I was prepared as when I laid on the slab she pulled my bottoms right up so I had an awful wedgey she then proceeded to rub cream all over up and down my legs and even grazed somewhere she shouldn‚Äôt have!! I was just laid there mortified! They again told us to flip over sit up all of which again wasn‚Äôt flattering when your boyfriend is laid across from you. They even hosed us directly in our faces to get some cream off. Again robe on ushered back to the pool. The massages we had after the hammam were great but the whole traumatising experience ruined it for me! Didn‚Äôt feel like I could say anything as they all just spoke in different languages so just sucked it up.    They provide a shuttle bus into Marrakech which is handy TIP: when you get off the bus if a gentleman comes to speak to you and says he works with the hotel and says he can show you to the markets DECLINE! We didn‚Äôt and he ended up showing us around the entire market taking us to different trade stalls (he clearly had an agreement with them) even took us to a random shop where they put us in a room and tried to sell us stuff. He walked us around for hours and we tried several times to tell him we were ok from here but he continued to follow us around. I‚Äôd had enough at one point and said enough is enough and he demanded loads of money from us for his time we ended up giving around 200 (roughly ¬£13) as he had taught us loads of stuff we wouldn‚Äôt have known he took it and left. This only left us with about 40 mins to ourselves as we‚Äôd booked our shuttle back.

The toilets in the room smell of sewage constantly throughout the day which was very disappointing and made the stay very unpleasant. The food on the buffet was lacking variety and was the same menu everyday for lunch and dinner. The Moroccan experience was however a tasteful experience.    The members on the snack bar were very disengaged de- motivated which showed when they presented themselves to members of the public.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Mareesa P wrote a review Feb 2019,50,"Peaceful, clean and allergy friendly.",This hotel is the perfect place for a relaxing getaway. 25 minutes from the airport 30 minutes from the M√©dina enough to escape the noise and totally relax. The hotel is VERY clean and the staff are some of the friendliest I have come across in this type of resort. Hafid the barman in the lobby bar was exceptional in fact the lobby bar and the restaurant staff were always smiling and welcoming. The service around the pools and snack bar however were not as good slow service and grumpy staff. The food in the hotel was ok a good choice but not always hot. The snack bar food was good so we ate lunch there most days.  My husband has a dairy allergy and it was very reassuring when we explained this to a manager in the restaurant he took my husband along the whole buffet line explaining what he could and couldn‚Äôt have for the first couple of days unfortunately this manager then had the rest of the week off and when we asked the chefs they tried to help us but we weren‚Äôt confident in what they said luckily the first couple of days with the manager gave us insight enough to choose safe options. It was great to holiday somewhere with even a little help when it comes to allergy information so I would say if you have any dietary restrictions this hotel is a good choice.  The whole place is so calm and relaxing in fact a lot of the time the staff were making more noise than the guests! February is a good time to go as the season hasn‚Äôt really started so you get the benefit of the space around the hotel.. not having to fight to get a sunbed (even the daybeds were available most of the time) and also the bar area wasn‚Äôt packed.  A couple of things worth knowing before you go....  1) the hotel takes a ¬£90 deposit on arrival we weren‚Äôt aware of this and unfortunately it cut our spending money in half but obviously when you check out they refund it.  2) there is a cash machine in the lobby we didn‚Äôt use it but had we known we could have saved time at the airport.  3) there is a local tour operator in the hotel lobby we booked through our rep when we were there which I would advise but the point is if you are unsure which trips to go on you can speak to someone when you are there.  Some observations for improvement  -It would have been nice to have drinks waiters around the pool I know this is a luxury but the staff were doing a great job in collecting empties it would have been nice if they asked if you wanted a refill before walking away.  - the staff do need to be taught how to lift furniture not drag it around it spoilt the ambience every time they decided to rearrange the sun loungers or the chairs for 10 minutes  - no room service here which is a shame we would have used it if it was on offer and there were a couple of people who we met who had been poorly and couldn‚Äôt leave their room so didn‚Äôt eat at all.  To be honest the above are very small issues which didn‚Äôt change the fact we had a fantastic time here. I would most certainly recommend this hotel to my friends and family.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Suffolk, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/990mareesap
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Croydongal wrote a review Feb 2019,40,Nice winter break,Myself and partner have just returned from a Tui 7 night all inclusive stay at this hotel. We both enjoyed our stay here and would recommend this hotel. Tui should let guests know however regarding the ¬£90 deposit required on arrival (this is fully refundable however on check out). We paid this in sterling which was no problem however would have been nice to have a heads up from Tui. The overall service is not that of a 5* hotel and can be hit and miss. Staff slow bringing drinks or not bringing drinks order at all. The service in the buffet restaurant does not cope well during busy times. Room was nice however as others also reported there was a sewage smell in the room which wasn‚Äôt great. Cleaners do a great job everyday though as the entire place is spotless. The rooms can by noisy as we were woken up by drunken revellers outside our room. In addition could also hear TVs in other rooms so the room insulation could be better. Spa was extremely expensive so we didn‚Äôt use it. The equivalent of ¬£20 to use indoor pool for 30 mins!!! No way! However the heated outdoor pool was a lovely temperature. The guy who is in charge of the poolside entertainment and fitness is great. He works really hard and always had a smile. A real asset for this hotel. I really didn‚Äôt see the point in the hotel photographers. The photos they took were just cheesy to be honest and then they would hassle you to purchase them. Just leave guests in peace to enjoy their holiday. If I want photos I will ask or just take them myself. The photographers just got in the way and could be intrusive.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,pep_freit wrote a review Feb 2019,50,Better than the pictures do justice,When you look at any hotel the pictures usually sell it beyond the reality. If anything Be Live undersells itself.    I‚Äôve stayed at a lot of all inclusive hotels and even the most well known and most expensive often leave something to be desired. I see them for what they are: a chance to relax by a pool have a constant stream of alcohol and the food to be ‚Äògood enough.‚Äô    Be Live was all the above and more. The resort was extremely quiet - I‚Äôd say maybe 10 or so people poolside each day. There was an extensive list of drinks including cocktails and the food was great!    The staff are everything you‚Äôd hope for. Friendly polite willing to go above and beyond but most importantly not too invasive. Salim Fati Karim Titif are all great advocates of the resort but the real superstar is the king of the poolside Simo. He totally embodies the resort and what it‚Äôs about and really does make everyone there feel as if they‚Äôre the most important person staying there.    I‚Äôve recommended the place to everyone I‚Äôve spoken to and two separate people and their partners have already booked up. Genuinely can‚Äôt recommend more and would happily return again in the future.

Every member of staff was polite professional helpful and always friendly.  We always felt safe.  Best wine at any all inclusive hot plates for food excellent selection and great shuttle bus service.  Simo fantastic entertainer and even managed to get us up to do aquarobics and yoga for 3 days. Some good evening entertainment too.  Watched how some people treated the staff quite rudely and with little respect during busy times.  They are all fantastic staff work very hard so please be nice to them and acknowledge their service with a little gratuity throughout your stay.  It‚Äôs nice to be nice.  Would recommended listing ingredients in sauces/dips foods etc and an allergens list would be good. Cocktails could be improved and a price list /menu for the Soa in each room would be helpful.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Sakina H wrote a review Feb 2019,40,Nice and relaxing,This hotel is lovely I stayed here for a week which was a nice break. This hotel is more 4 star than 5 but has a lot of potential. This hotel has mostly pros but a few cons too.    The staff at this hotel are very hardworking they constantly on the go and always very polite. The waiter/ waitress at the snack bar were really friendly and polite the waiters at the buffet restaurant were really good too. and the guy at the lobby bar was really attentive would always get you another drink when running low his service was impeccable.    The food at the hotel is ok the snack bar was nice and the buffet restaurant was edible and had an array to choose from. I went to the A la Carte restaurant the food wasn‚Äôt nice the service by waiters was great but food just hard and greasy and doesn‚Äôt reflect Moroccan cuisine or represent the hotel well.    The spa was pricey but really nice I got the 600 dirham deal which was fantastic well worth it the money I spent. The receptionist-lady at the spa was very nice too.    Entertainment was vast too during the day there is aqua aerobics archery football and yoga and spinning at the gym. At night the entertainment doesn‚Äôt begin until 10pm I think they could do this a little earlier.    The bedrooms are nice and clean and spacious the bathroom is lovely but not really sure about the window unless you are a couple you have no privacy. The sewage system does smell at times but closing the door helped.    There is a safe in the bedroom I advice people to use this you get a letter before about this and about the hotel. I forgot and left some money in my bag and once returning from a day trip realised it was gone. Obviously reading the letter It was in my entirely own discretion.  There is a mini fridge with only water in. It would be good if there was snacks and other drinks in as you cant get food after 10pm.    This hotel would also benefit room service with an additional charge if need be as times for food are a little mundane.    There is 3 pools at this hotel one at the spa but you have to pay and 2 outdoor. The heated outdoor is were there is music and entertainment and the other pool has a swim up pool but really cold this would be ok in the summer but if it was heated would have a lot more appeal.    To go into town there is a shuttle bus I used this twice which saved on money.    Overall this hotel is lovely and peaceful a little out the way but the shuttle is acceptable.  I would definitely return if I went to Marrakech again.,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sakinah2014

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,CeEmDee wrote a review Jan 2019,30,Such a shame,There is so much potential going on for this hotel but I have categorised the various aspects and given each our star rating and divided and the median came out as average. Which is a shame.    The building and the setting: the hotel is beautiful and the grounds equally so. Georaphically this is not the place to go out for an evening stroll after dinner; it is quite isolated. The courtesy buses to and from the city centre during the day are useful. Our room overlooked the pool and we did get a bit fed up of the constant music play over the speakers by the guy in charge of the pool activities. Fine when poll exercise classes take place not so for the hours inbetween.    Reception Staff: all I would wish for: pleasant and helpful    Room and Service: room was lovely and well serviced each day. Although towels still get changed everyday regardless of whether you chose the environmentally friendly option of not putting them in the tub. A BIG ISSUE with the room and we found from others they had the same issue in the morning there is an unpleasant sewerage smell in the room possibly down to when the toilets are being used to maximum. Another point we came into the room late one morning and the smell had changed to on of mayonnaise: still trying to work that one out !    Staff: Inconsistant attitudes. One day pleasant; the next not so. Two members of staff stood out as consistantly wonderful: a young lady in the snack bar area by the pool. We won't give her name as we didn't ask if we could and she didn't ask us to. The other is Hammesh. He served us many times in the evening buffet and asked us to mention him in any review.    Food: often not very tasty usually only warm. Overall we did not enjoy the food very much. The scrambled eggs are to be avoided and the coffee is so poor that I had tea in the morning and one of them one morning had been made with cold water.,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"North Wales, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aimtoturnleft

Mohammed the baggage handler and Sidi Ba were extremely helpful and willing to do whatever it takes to make sure you are happy.    What I would suggest to management is to have some heating arrangement in the reception area - we went in December when mornings and evenings are cold. Some days we wanted to sit at reception area etc but it was too chilly.    Also the bar opposite the restaurant is too loud in the evenings! Also you should not have to go the bar for a hot drink especially if you don't drink alcohol etc - its a bit awkward to get a hot drink from the bar when entertainment and alcoholic drinks are going on.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/748salmak

They do a fantastic job all day with lots of things for everyone to join in with or just to simply relax and observe.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Charlotte H wrote a review Jan 2019,30,Sub standard,This review is an honest review no grudges.    The hotel was very clean and tidy modern and well laid out. Not a huge hotel so not a lot going on in the evenings during the day etc. The drinks where terrible. Very cheap local booze and cocktails were rubbish all served in dirty plastic glasses and tasted different every time you ordered one. Very tight on water etc and no drinks were allowed to be taken to your rooms. Staff unpleasant and not friendly my partner got told he wasn‚Äôt allowed anymore alcohol because he accidentally broke a wine glass at dinner. The food was terrible everything tastes rank and seems all over the place. No ‚Äòthemes‚Äô if you like. And don‚Äôt even bother trying the waited restaurant. We walked out after first course just terrible terrible food. We also played quiet music on my small speaker by the pool bar and was told to be quiet and turn it off despite everyone enjoying it. Lots of sunbeds 'reserved' with towels first thing in the morning but no one returning to the bed all day long! Spa was lovely to walk around but hugely overpriced.    Wouldn‚Äôt ever stay at that hotel again. We would look to stay at a Riu one next time we go. We absolutely loved the Marrakesh nightlife it was the best I‚Äôve ever experienced in the Hivernage district. Hotel got us a taxi guy called Hakim and he took us about each night into the city to get away from the terrible entertainment and booze the hotel provides.    If you're expecting a typical 5 star that you would find in say Turkey or Tunisia it is of that standard hotel itself was pretty and clean but everything else was disappointing. I recently went to a 5 star all inclusive in the Caribbean and the difference is astonishing if this is what you are used to then you'd rate this hotel probably 3 stars at most.    I will 100% be returning to Marrakech just not this hotel.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Natalie Savera wrote a review Jan 2019,50,Amazing! Best Solo trip,So I stayed at this hotel last week and honestly after reading some of the reviews I was so close to changing - I am glad I didn't.    Room:    The hotel rooms are huge spacious (I had two double beds in mine) and most importantly CLEAN! The cleaner comes everyday and change bed sheets etc. The rooms include a mini fridge two huge built in wardrobe flat screen TV and a nice spacious balcony. My bathroom had a shower and bath tub and extra room for the toilet. The power shower was amazing was the water was hot!    My only negatives about the room is that bath did not have a stopper so you actually cannot have a bath (which in my opinion is a bit pointless). Also I agree with the comment about having a kettle in the room sometimes I fancied a cup of tea but had to wait during the designated food hours.    Staff:    The staff were friendly and absolutely amazing and helpful. From the moment I checked in till the moment I left I really was pleased with the service. I fell Ill during this trip (flu) so when I asked the restaurant manager if he could get me some Garlic and water he catered to me without any problems. All of the restaurant staff were nice helpful and efficient. The food was also really good.    The Spa    After reading the reviews I was a bit hesitant about visiting the spa. However as I had the flu I was desperate to use the sauna. The Spa its self was incredible! The ambiance again to the service it was actually my highlight of the trip.    The spa manager offered me 1 hour to use the Sauna and pool for 200dirham. I opted for the cheapest deal which included the sauna a hammack bath and 15 mins by the pool (served with tea) and a 30 minutes massage for 600 dirham!    I did at first think the prices were a bit steep but after converting the price into pounds I was pretty impressed with what you actually get. I was there for just over an hour and felt much better after my treatment. I would definitely recommend anybody who wants to use the spa.    All in all I would most likely come back to this hotel I have been to Marrakech before so I am pretty confident you will not find a better hotel (at the price). I have recommended this hotel to so many people now and I have been back a week!,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled solo,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/naesymone

The bars restaurants and entertainment were all very welcoming and the staff was even more welcoming and because one person in my party was less abled and used a mobility scooter they could not do enough for her and the hotel was also scooter friendly.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Craig Wilson wrote a review Jan 2019,40,Be Live Collection,We recently visited this Hotel for a bit of winter sun. We had two rooms in Block 1 and 2 for my parents and for my wife and I.    The rooms where spotless and very well maintained along with the grounds of the hotel I would possibly go out and say these where the cleanest rooms and grounds we have seen in the years of holidaying. We both had a swim up room which I would say are ideal for the summer months however in January the pool is so cold its unusable I slightly feel this room was wrongly sold to us as its not connected to the main pool and is unusable. The one time I stood in the swim up room I just about fell as the tiles were very slippy under the water not sure if these had not been cleaned as the pool was unusable. We spent two days at our room terrace and didn‚Äôt see anyone clean these areas.    There is a single pool which is heated however this is still a shock to the system at this time of year however as you acclimatize its much nicer we felt the pool at its best first thing in the morning when the cover was pulled off. Again the swimming pool area was very clean and well looked after the staff around the pool where excellent and very attentive with activities such as Yoga Archery water fitness and so on. We spent most of our time at the swimming pool getting as much sun as we possibly could. I would like to mention Karim Keera who was part of the entertainment team we loved speaking to him and my wife was amazed by his magic tricks I would say this is one of the main points that made our holiday.    The bar at night always had entertainment on and was always packed out some nights we unfortunately struggled to get seats I would suggest a larger bar area especially with there being no local areas close to walk to. Again there was a young man working in the bar that served us very well and was always very helpful. Unfortunately I didn‚Äôt catch his name however he had braces and always had a massive smile.    There was a good mix of local and home cooked foods so most days the selection suited everyone and if that didn‚Äôt suit there was the outside snack bar which served food most of the day.    We hired the electric bikes on site just for an hour and went for a look about I would highly recommend this as the area the hotel is in is very vast.    I would say the hotel lived to my expectations and in most cases exceed them however there was a couple of small faults that could be corrected by the travel agents.    The one massive disappointment was down to a small group of people holidaying at the same time They seemed to drink as much as they could all day and all night and make idiots of themselves on their last night one of them was sick in the bar/reception area which was cleaned quickly however I informed the reception staff of the mess they left in the bathrooms twice before it was cleaned up.

You have to use the hotel shuttle bus if you want to go to the center. On 2 occasions we took the bus and it broke down so we were stranded for at least 1 hour. Food is not all that good and drinks is the cheap alcohol.  Stuff. Spa was not open when divertissement and the food was limited by the pool. They treated people like children even though it was an Adult Only Hotel. Reception staff was very rude and also some of the bar staff. Restaurant staff were ok. In all not a pleasant hotel to stay and definitely not a 5 star hotel more like a 2.5 star,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeniseH53

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Leah wrote a review Jan 2019,50,Wonderful hotel with wonderful staff!,My partner and I have just returned from our stay at Be Live Collection and could not be happier with the service we received during our holiday. One thing I have learnt is that a tip goes a long way!    After reading some of the reviews we were worried as to what to expect with the hotel however after our stay cannot fault the hotel nor its staff in any way. The staff were always friendly and would always go the extra mile for their guests. The entertainment team were amazing and always ensured that something was happening (day and night) so we were never bored. Two members of staff which stood out to us were Karim and Titif who never had too little time for us.    Both me and my partner are Vegetarian and we never had any issues with the food in the buffet restaurant and there was always a wide spread of food throughout the day in both the snack bar and restaurant. The restaurant staff were always accommodating to our requests and made sure that every guest was happy with the food and service received. The only complaint with the food is that it was sometimes a little bland but never tasteless. We always had our drinks topped up and were never waiting for staff to remove plates etc as staff were always on top of things. We were served by Oussama throughout the week who was one of the best servers I have met.    The hotel was ALWAYS clean throughout and bedrooms were cleaned daily to a high standard. Our bedroom was spacious and comfortable we had heating/air con a safe which was free to use plenty of storage including hanging space a private garden/balcony area and a mini fridge which was empty on arrival but could be filled at an additional cost. The bathroom was large and again always clean there was a window (with a blind) looking into the bedroom and a separate room with a toilet. There was a slight drainage smell coming from the toilet so would recommend keeping the door closed at all times.    The facilities in the hotel were wonderful with two large outdoor pools (one heated and the other with a swim up bar) activities going on throughout the day ping pong tables beautiful gardens photographers and bars serving food & drink throughout the day. As well as the entertainment in the hotel we were also a short drive from the centre of Marrakech with the free bus service or taxis which were always available.    I would recommend this hotel to everybody and we are looking forward to returning in the near future.,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Worsley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leahfrank
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,cameronw409 wrote a review Jan 2019,50,Amazing Holiday!,Myself and my partner stayed here 6th-13th January this year. After reading some of the reviews we were both a bit worried about what to expect. However my advice to anyone is to ignore the bad reviews as the hotel was amazing!    Every single staff member in the hotel was pleasant and couldn‚Äôt do enough for you. A bit of advice is that tips go a long way anywhere in Marrakech especially in the hotel. Our holiday was made special by 2 staff members in particular. They were Karim who is part of the entertainment team and Oussama who is a waiter in the buffet restaurant. Those 2 staff members were the highlight of my holiday and are a credit to the hotel. Karim always made sure we were not bored and had something to do such as archery yoga table tennis and he even showed us a few magic tricks and taught us how to do them. Oussama always made us feel welcome in the restaurant and wanted our experience to be a great one. He made sure our drinks were always topped up and ensured everything was always good.    The rooms themselves are spacious and clean with plenty of space for storage. You have a mini fridge to keep drinks cool but will be empty on arrival but can be filled for an additional cost. The bathroom was amazing however I would advise you to keep the toilet door closed all the time as the drainage system isn‚Äôt perfect and smells often came through to the room. However I‚Äôve been to many hotels and it‚Äôs quite a common issue so nothing too bad for me. Another comment about the rooms would be that an iron isn‚Äôt inside the rooms. I believe you can borrow one from reception but I think having your own in your room would be handy. All in all though the rooms were excellent and cleaned daily to a very high standard.    The food in the buffet restaurant was great! Myself and my partner are both vegetarian and there was plenty on offer for us to enjoy. The food was always warm and tasted good. I heard a few comments from guests saying the food was bland and to a degree I agree with this however I wouldn‚Äôt say the food was tasteless.  There is a tagine area a grill station a pizza and pasta station and much more other choices.  The food at the snack bar outside was also very good and the staff who worked in there were also great.    Myself and my partner will definitely be coming back in the near future as we had an amazing time! Don‚Äôt be put off by bad reviews.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Lolpool33 wrote a review Jan 2019,40,"Excellent hotel, not quite 5 star..",Arrived around 8pm on 1st Jan first impressions were that the hotel looked stunning. We went and ate at the buffet which was lovely too. Lobby bar a little bit daunting at first probably as it‚Äôs size as it is a small bar and needs more tables and chairs. There is a big room on the first floor that the hotel is missing a trick with! Could be turned into a bigger bar with proper entertainment and room to dance if you want to or sit and have a quiet drink.  There is a sports bar brilliant I thought but it opens at 10pm each evening! Again such a missed opportunity! You could play pool in the day if if the bar was open. And needs more than one pool table!  Simo and Kamir ran pool entertainment throughout the day what assets to the hotel! Great guys!  Evening entertainment was also good but would have been much better in the bigger room with a bigger bar.  Spa another shame as it was ridiculously expensive! No real deals and no movement on the prices such a shame as we would have used all of the spa facilities had they been better priced.  Food was lovely albeit very much repeated. My husband is a celiac and the hotel didn‚Äôt really understand or cater for him so he had to be extremely careful with what he chose to eat. Mourad in the restaurant was a lovely guy too always smiling. The hotel needs to brush up on allergies and cater for these with clear signage where food contains wheat and gluten!  I do hope the hotel management take the comments on board as we do intend to revisit next year. It would be be good to hear their plans to take on the constructive advice.,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lolpool33

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Mike1766 wrote a review Jan 2019,40,Good Break,We travelled to this hotel as recommended by your golf travel. Firstly there is no golf on site so you need to travel to and from the various courses nearby.    The hotel accommodation is certainly comfortable but I would not say the hotel is 5 *. The food is plentiful and lots of choice available and should cover off most tastes. The staff are very helpful indeed so all in all the stay was pleasant enough.    The biggest issue they have is that the pools are freezing cold!!! Why have a swim up bar in the main pool when no one can use it due to it being Baltic... heat the pool the clientele will use the pool more people will enjoy the surroundings more relax and you will see more interaction between guests.    Overall a good stay but would go elsewhere if revisiting Marrakesh for golf.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Oxfordshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mike1766
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Nmh wrote a review Jan 2019,50,Lovely adults only hotel in Marrakech,I stayed here with my best friend in the summer and thoroughly enjoyed our holiday. The hotel is gorgeous and since it is so newly opened the whole place felt very clean and modern.  They have a lovely spa underground with the gym which we visited twice and would highly recommend. The hamman at the beginning of your stay is ideal if you want your tan to last longer!  Lovely swim up bar in the smaller pool (great selection of drinks - I‚Äôd recommend sticking to the San Miguel as opposed to the sickly cocktails simply because of the wasps!) where we spent most of our time. This pool is much quieter and more peaceful whereas the larger rectangular pool is noisier and has daytime activities. Great food at all the dining options and an easy shuttle into Marrakech city to explore in the daytime or evening.

The poolside lunch menu as well is also very good. However the √† la cart restaurant not great. We use the spa facilities over a course of two days as a package it was amazing 4.5hours of total relaxation! The hotel is peaceful and is on the outskirts away from the hustle and bustle. The hotel offer a free shuttle bus service runs on the hour takes about 15 minutes to get into the centre definitely worth it.

Simo Salim Fati Karim IbrahimTitif were few names i cannot forget as they were always around to help during our week long stay. The best part of the hotel was that though we checked out at 12noon on the final day they allowed us to use all facilities including unlimited food and drink until we left the hotel around 6pm. This shows that the management is not after money but customer satisfaction. Well done. 9 out 10.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Patrycja wrote a review Jan 2019,30,Honest review of our New Year stay,My husband and I just came back from a 5 days break at the hotel. The hotel is located 30 mins by taxi from the airport in the Palmeraie district.    We arrived at 3pm there were a few couples checking in at the same time. Check in was long we were told to sit down fill in our details then we paid for our room and a security deposit (you can pay by card no need for local currency). Those simple three things took 30 mins as the person helping us kept answering phone calls from the rooms.    No one gave us a tour of the hotel or facilities and we weren‚Äôt told of activities until we discovered a plan by the entertainment booth by the pool.    The room was very nice comfortable king size bed plenty of room for storage and to hung our clothes. The bathroom was also specious and modern. There were very few amenities provided; shampoo conditioner and soap but no shower gel or cotton buds which I consider a bare minimum at a hotel which claims to be 5 star.    The hotel has two swimming pools a party one heated pool with music playing and entertainment team organising activities for the guests and a quiet one where the water is outside temperature. Both of the pools have bars but the quiet one doesn‚Äôt have a food service. Towels can also be only picked up from the party one so it‚Äôs a bit of a walk each time if you prefer a relaxing atmosphere of the quiet pool.    Food was a highlight for me. All meals had a good selection of dishes and were very tasty. There was always a bread station egg station pancakes Moroccan food station  salads fresh juices fruit and sweet breads for dinners tagines (three types) barbecue meat and fish station as well as pizza and pasta.  What was very disappointing was the quality of alcohol no known brands at all very cheap and tasteless. I didn‚Äôt like anything I tried.    We spent the New Year eve at the hotel which organised a Gala Dinner. It was a drinks reception (Same cheap alcohol as every day) with canap√©s four course meal such as lobster soup beef medallion and a white chocolate dessert. The party was very boring to start with and Samba performance of poor quality but then the hotel brought our great Brazilian drummers and dj and some of the accessories for us to get dressed up and that made the party real fun. Unfortunately they decided to finish the night with a live band which was terrible and majority of the guests lefts around 1am-1:30am.    We tried to get information on the programme of the New Year party prior to arrival to the hotel as well as front desk at the hotel and they weren‚Äôt able to give us any details even on a day of the Gala Dinner.    Hotel provides the transport to the city (stop just outside Koutoubia Mosque) it leaves at 9:20 10:30 15:35 17:35 20:05 and returns at 12:30 13:45 19:00 21:00 and 22:30. You need to book at least two hours in advance to get a seat.    Overall it‚Äôs a decent hotel but definitely not a five star. The reception team are rude and very slow room service is none existent our numerous request for iron and water were simply ignored. The service overall leaves a lot to be desired but the food is good and the rooms comfortable and very clean.

The restaurant team was great and after the first two days the servers knew your drinks of by heart and we never waited longer than 5 minutes maximum for our drinks. The pools are nice and the animation team try and get everyone involved. I can not fault them for any of the above.  However the reason why I‚Äôm not giving this hotel 5 stars is the incredibly rude front desk staff. Every time we went to the desk (to book the bus into town get some cash or have our key rescanned for the 20th time in 7 days) the receptionists were rude and condescending often acting like we were a great inconvenience. Especially when trying to book the on site restaurant we were told to book in advance. when we asked the restaurant was apparently booked out every night but always empty when we walked past.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,186338Rob wrote a review Dec 2018,40,Well appointed for a relaxing break,We spent the Christmas week here having booked a package with Tui. The hotel offers very good facilities with two outdoor swimming pools (not heated) an outdoor snack bar and a pool bar. We had a suite which was huge and well appointed. A bed was placed in the lounge area for the third adult in the party and we still had more than enough room to spread out. The room was well maintained and spotless. We had a huge balcony overlooking the snack bar and pool. I‚Äôd recommend asking for a room/suite overlooking the second pool as it would be much quieter as they do have blaring music around the main pool all day. The hotel is all inclusive. The food in the main dining room was plentiful and well displayed but we found it very bland and in need of some seasoning. The more intimate restaurant (which you are allowed to use once during a 7 night holiday) was a big disappointment. Again bland food with two menu choices. Drinks were acceptable and plentiful (no well known brands) and were available at the snack bar pool bar lounge and the dinning room. The hotel is situated well outside Marrakech but offered a shuttle bus service into the old town. The problem was the frequency of this service which meant that we had to use a taxi on occasion as the last shuttle in the morning was about 10.30 and the first in the afternoon well after 15.00. I had a massage at the spa. It had had a good write up but I was surprised that they didn‚Äôt ask for any details of injuries operations etc which any well appointed spa would do. The massage itself was mediocre.  All in all this is a good holiday hotel that pretty much provides the services advertised.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Lt3 wrote a review Dec 2018,30,Lovely Hotel but HUGE Security Risk,"I stayed here Christmas week as a lady travelling on her own. Firstly there was confusion checking in with some people being seen to whilst others were just told to sit down. Rooms are stunning the bathroom fabulous. As with most hotels the rooms have sliding glass doors which (supposedly) lock simply by flicking down a latch...or so you think. Due to a bit of jet lag I decided to have an early night on my first night. At about 10pm I was woken by the opening of the doors and a man entering my room. Once I half screamed at him he retreated having spoken to a 2nd man behind him!! I immediately rang reception to tell them and all I got was ""Was it another tourist who was confused?"" (No) ""How do you know it was a Morrocan man (he spoke to a 2nd man in Arabic). He then grudgingly said security would have a look around. Not once was there any concern from staff about my safety or wellbeing or any reassurances I was very shook up as a lady on my own. 20 mins later I just get a call to say there was nobody there and that was that. The next morning I explained the incident to the young Tui Rep who didn't seem overly bothered and said she would contact me later and fill out an incident form. Of course no contact was made despite her having my number due to me booking one of her trips. Not great Tui. I work for a hotel back in England and we take matters of security very seriously.It just seemed swept under the carpet. Other than this the hotel staff are good Karim and Simo are great although they will beg you to write a review. Food is mediocre and the same every day. The bar/snack bars are understaffed with often one person on to serve many people. Shuttle bus to market great although if you miss the return 13.45 bus back you are stranded there until the next one at 7pm. Don't quite understand that. Main entertainment doesnt start until 10pm which in my opinon is too late. Hotel will change your money into Dirhams but don't want to know if you want to change them back at the end of the holiday. Recommend the balloon trip excursion however they bill it as a sunrise excursion when it's not.

The hotel is very clean and well looked after and they provide a shuttle into the centre throughout the day as well! The hotel is just a little bit outside of Marrakech so taxis the medina and the souks are not walking distance. either the shuttle or a taxi is your best option although the taxis do not run fast 10pm to the hotel.

The food is excellent and the selection should suite everyones choice with both traditional Moroccan and European. The staff are attentive and willing to help in both the main restaurant and the pool snack bar the drinks are of a high standard the cleanliness is exceptional everywhere. There are poolside activities throughout the day and entertainment in the evenings.  So far we cannot fault anything.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Lori G wrote a review Dec 2018,50,GREAT HOTEL!! Would highly recommend.,My boyfriend and I stayed in the Be Live collection Hotel 14th - 21st of Dec ‚Äò18 and I cannot recommend the hotel enough. We had read a lot of negative reviews before arriving and were slightly apprehensive but they couldn‚Äôt be further from what we experienced.    Arrival:  Before we had arrived we had read other reviews complaining on the lack of information provided on the security deposit and on the deposit for the towels. However we received an email from our travel agents prior to arrival informing us of the payments and the process for paying them.    Food & Service:    Breakfast lunch and dinner in the restaurant and the snack bar available to provide breakfast and lunch (panini‚Äôs burgers & pizza etc) and some of the best chips (fries) we‚Äôve ever tasted in our lives.    The food for all meals came in great variety was fresh and changed daily to avoid repetitiveness. Thoroughly enjoyed eating the meals in the hotel.    The service from staff in the snack bar and in the restaurant was fantastic. There was a gentleman serving food and a women serving drinks who spoke great English and French and who cared to all our needs and loved a bit of chat. Special mention to the waiter who served us in the Restaurant most nights Mourad. Mourad was great always providing drinks with a smile and asking how our day was very attentive and caring.    Also in normal all inclusive hotels the drinks are watered down but can ensure you this was not the case in the be live collection drinks were delicious and just like back home.    Room:  The room and the hotel in general was immaculate. Comfy big beds with plenty of room and very modern.    Entertainment:  There was entertainment on everyday run by the hotel entertainment team who were unbelievable so enthusiastic and great for getting everyone involved. Activities were fun and good way to get to know others staying in the hotel.  Also the hotel has a sports bar/games room which has every game you can think of ( pool table dominoes cards uno... etc) They also showed the English premier league games when they were on for the guests. Late night sandwiches were also a great touch Adbel    Great variety of entertainment at the lobby bar at night Great service from Mohssine.    Rambled on a bit but overall couldn‚Äôt fault the hotel and the service. We will certainly be back and will be recommending to our friends and family.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T3875HJlorig

I was not running anywhere as I was staying for 7 days A couple of essentials missing as in cotton buds and face towels little things like these make a hotel a five-star hotel. so this hotel is not a five-star hotelWe were all inclusive and the international food was amazing and good but the local Moroccan food there was a very strange smell coming from the food which all guests were complaining about and were disliking the food later on we were told it is a kind of herb that is being used I disagree I think it was definitely something else as in to do with animals The entertainment was good at least something every evening.I don't know if this is professional or not but the hotel staff would dine with the guestsIn my experience of five-star hotels this definitely does not happen anywhere in the world. I had a leaking sink in my room enough said!This is not 5 star standards!I am yet still making my mind up if i could bring myself to recommend this hotel because of all the previous examples I have presented!,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vacationer237950

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Jodie wrote a review Dec 2018,30,Its Ok for a chill out,The hotel itself is nice although it does not look new - there is a lot of maintenance issues and the drains sometimes smelt awful. The food in the buffet is nice although not hot and quite repetitive. There is also large amount of fish which is not great if you do not eat it. Evenings are quiet but hotel was not busy and entertainment does not start until 10pm which we found quite late when its every night. Also the amount of flies round the snack bar and when you are eating is hard to bare. The Morrocan Al A cart restaurant was the worst I have ever been too - both me and my partner could not eat the food and it was empty most nights where other people did not like the look for it either.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,laserkid wrote a review Dec 2018,40,Winter escape,The weather in December appeared very stabil with sunny days and cold nights.  We found this new hotel very clean and friendly for the adults stay.  The rooms are large with comfy bed but furniture looks more like tourist 4 star than 5 star standard.  The bathroom is spacious well arranged with seperate shower bathtube and WC.  Since the size of the hotel is not big slightly more than 200 rooms and the there are only storey buildings this venue is not congested and guarantees pretty full intimacy.  In the all inclusive option the food was rather repetitive with menu not very appealing. The breakfast choice was very samay every day and some dishes like meats and cheeses looked dried up and not tempting.  The bar is quite small and in the evening when there is organized the enterteinment could be lack of seats and very loudly.  The essential pros of this entity is free shuttle into the town centre the last after dinner with return 10.30 pm.  The staff is friendly tactful and not intrusive.  Generally the Be Live Collection is a good address and the town Marrakesh offers interesting and safe vacation with wide cultural and sightseeing program.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Lodz, Poland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laserkid

The hotel is new and kept really clean and runs a bus several times a day into the city centre. It's about a 25 minute drive.    Two good sized pools outside and Simo in the entertainment team is a good guy. All the service we got was really good by the staff and they did a really nice gesture for my partner's birthday. The food wasn't bad but not great either. The one thing they could improve is the food labelling as sometimes I didn't know what certain things were which would be a problem for vegetarians,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Brighton and Hove, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marksB9853OE
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,ktmitch89l wrote a review Dec 2018,40,Not quite 5*,It was our first visit to Marrakech and chose this hotel because we felt that adults only would be more suitable especially for some winter sun where we just wanted to get some heat and relax. We had been told by a couple of people that some people out in Morocco were rude but we weren‚Äôt expecting it at the hotel. That being said it was only one female reception attendant however this happened very early on arrival in fact.    Other than this our experience of the hotel was quite good. It‚Äôs very much a first generation all inclusive where there‚Äôs only one buffet restaurant and an a la carte (which you can only use once). The a la carte restaurant had 2 set menus to choose from but the food was delicious. In the buffet there was a variety of food with options for all but they were very samey. Lunch and dinner often had a similar selection. But the breakfast was great as there was a variety of foods which you would eat only once a day.  There is also a snack bar which serves breakfast from 10am (with a small menu) and also lunch which is great for those who want things like a club sandwich pizza burgers etc.    The pools were great. A nice size and you have a choice of two. The quieter pool which is to the right of the doors to the back of the hotel and the activity pool for all your aqua aerobics Zumba etc. The latter is a fair bit warmer than the first. But the first also boasts a pool bar. The activities available are varied and there is something for everyone (if you like that sort of thing)    As for the rooms they have everything you need and are always clean. The maids regularly stock the shampoo/lotion etc and make your bed but only change the bedding/towels every 3 days to save on laundry costs and the effect on the environment which is great!  Another lovely touch was that when the staff found out we were there on our anniversary we were treated to a gorgeous arrangement of petals and the maids actually spent the time to arrange our towels into swans.    All in all a fantastic place to get away. I think there are just some tweaks that need to be made for it to be truly a 5* establishment,Date of stay: December 2018,,"Caerphilly, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ktmitch89l

I travelled with my nan and I work in travel sales so was nervous to stay in a new hotel. I now always recommend this hotel to customers when I can and have had customers return happy from this hotel where I sent them. My customers came back to tell me that our pictures were up in the hotel haha! I emailed the hotel on a few occasions before travel and they were quick to respond.    The photographer Fikri was amazing. He took amazing pictures of me with my nan with the flowers and sunset and when her favorite song came on the karaoke night he could tell she wanted to dance so he danced with her and it was so lovely she was so happy that night.    Food was amazing. Buffet is small but worked for us at the time. I can imagine busier months can get crowded. But there was so much choice for food and it was all delicious I didn't even bother with the a la carte which we got to eat in for free once a week. Animation team were great leave you alone when you want to be. Pool snack bar great you can get great burgers and pizzas outside. Cabana beds free if you get there in time. Shower had a blind separating bathroom from bedroom which was see through so me and my nan had a deal to sit on the terrace during shower time which was fine but would have preferred more privacy. Hotel helped me print my boarding passes in reception. Gift shop SO cheap for nice handmade items. Booked the double superior which gave us two double beds in one room which was nice. Entertainment was karaoke live music in the lounge bar african dancers upstairs in the function room. I didn't try the sports bar.    The lounge bar was really social lots of people chatting and making friends. cocktails amazing. It was just stunning the gardeners were always out taking pride in the beautiful gardens...shuttle bus was fab too souks are a must see..

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Allan S wrote a review Dec 2018,40,18th November,Overall appearance - Very clean and constantly being kept clean.  Not a very big hotel and couldn‚Äôt cope with the low numbers in November so no idea how it will cope in peak.  It‚Äôs already showing signs of age even though it‚Äôs not a year old.  Beds and cushions around the pool ripped. The beds are broken. Maintenance men are everywhere repainting.  You do have to pay a deposit of a 1000dhm on arrival. Not what you‚Äôd expect at a 5 star hotel. This is for room keys and pool towels cards.    Food - A small Buffett restaurant that isn‚Äôt big enough for the numbers.  Food was very repetitive and poorly signed.  My wife is a vegetarian and had little hot choice. Thank god for the fresh pasta choice every night.  A lot of the food was Luke warm.  There is an A la Carter choice but we chose to ignore it as the menu was not very appealing and no one who went recommended it. Some of them even went straight to the main restaurant after coming out.there is a snack bar which serves burgers / pizza / Pannonia and salads. This was good.    Drink - The mini bar is extra and quite expensive. I would‚Äôve expected that to have been stocked with local beer and soft drinks.  The beer is good but the cocktails were very weak unless you asked for extra.  The bar was busy and didn‚Äôt always have enough waiters on.  There was only one bar which is quite small and. Didn‚Äôt have enough seats so unless you got in early you either had to stand or go outside.    Entertainment- some good and some ok.  The problem was that it was in the same place as the bar. Small area loud noise. Couldn‚Äôt really talk to others. Might be ok in peak season but was a downside.    Rooms - we had a swim up room. Waters not heated so didn‚Äôt use it. The room was big and spacious. The beds are comfy.  Bathrooms are big as well. Even though the mirror fell of the wall in the first night it was a very good room.  The air con was on heat and we couldn‚Äôt change it. Had to turn it off when it got to 30 degrees.  The tv channel choices are limited but if the entertainment is on it‚Äôs not a problem.  Minibar only had a bottle of water in it. There is a price list for other stuff if you want it but it‚Äôs expensive.    Pools - main pool is heated but the swim up pool bar one isn‚Äôt. Too cold to go in it. Would be ok in middle of summer though.  Even though the staff were going around clearing glasses away from around the pools they never asked if anyone wanted a drink. You had to go to the bars yourself. Something else you‚Äôd expect at a 5 star hotel.    Staff - they were all friendly and helpful. Only issue was that sometimes they‚Äôd getting chatting to each other and forget about you. Not for long though.    Overall I‚Äôd say this hotel is a good 4 star but for Thomas Cook to class it as a signature hotel is a let down.  It could improve in high season when more outdoor stuff could be going on.    If you want a quiet holiday at a nice hotel but don‚Äôt expect the full 5 star pampering then go for it but if you want the full 5 star treatment I‚Äôd recommend going elsewhere.,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Crewe, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/232allans
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Chris T wrote a review Dec 2018,50,"Friendly, helpful and hardworking staff make all the difference!",Having just returned from our holiday (with TUI) in the last week of November we can say that we were highly delighted. We booked through a travel agent in the high street and so didn't bother checking out reviews until it was too late! I will admit to slight trepidation in the light of some very damning ones but I am happy to report that we found next to nothing to complain about in fact the opposite - we had a great time.    The rooms are fantastic - the beds so so comfortable. We had no shower issues or any drain smells. Loved the bathroom.    We thought that the food was exceptionally good with a fantastic range of things to try. By and large it was all pretty tasty. If you pick something you aren't happy with just go up and get something else - no problem. All the dining room staff were without exception charming and as helpful as they could be. Yes we did encounter a couple of occasions where they were a bit slow with a replacement drink but that was at times when they were all struggling to keep up with clearing tables at times of peak demand. We could see that they were flat out and not standing about ignoring us. A little bit of a wait at times did us no harm we were on holiday after all.The red wine (didn't try the white or rose) was surprisingly good and the beer was perfectly acceptable. We didn't get all the names of the dining room staff but we would like to thank them all for their cheerful service with a smile. It makes such a difference!    Outside the gardens are beautiful and very well tended and the two pools are very nice. The quiet pool is as cold as people have already said! Too cold for me! It was a shame because the swim up bar was hardly used at all - pretty dull for the bar staff! No doubt it comes into its own in the height of summer when temperatures soar but I feel that not to have it heated at cooler times of the year is missing a trick.  The activities pool is a nice temperature and we spent nearly all our time around this one. Yes there is the constant music being played at various levels of volume. It tended to go up a notch when the Aqua aerobics was on. At first it was a bit intrusive but by the end of the week we were quite used to it. We were all encouraged by the team running the various activities available to have a go. The team of Simo Titif Karim and Fati were all brilliant. My wife took to the Aqua aerobics from day one whilst I decided that total slobbing out was more the preferred course of action. Simo with his disarming gentle cajoling and humorous micky taking eventually persuaded me to take to the water and join my wife after a couple of days. OMG! what a workout! Very enjoyable despite me having the most uncoordinated arms and legs in the pool. Several beers required immediately afterwards! Table tennis was also available and we got right into that! Thank you Simo and the rest you were awsome!    We took the free bus into town on one occasion which worked well.    I didn't sample the spa so cannot comment. I arrived at the hotel very tense and expecting to need a massage to help me unwind but everything about the place was so relaxing a massage was unnecessary!    To sum up: We thoroughly enjoyed our trip. We were generally lucky with the weather so lounging round the pool was very enjoyable. On the first couple of days it was rather cool so you had to wrap up in a towel! We had a swim up room but the water was freezing (unheated) and probably only worth having in the height of summer.  The front desk staff were polite and professional and far from the grumpy so and so's they have been described in some reviews.    The queues at the airport are truly dreadful!!! Apart from that - a great value holiday.,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Plymouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trigger530

Dont forget to book some trips when you are there. I went on the Marrakech at night the waterfalls and Atlas mountains. All worth it and you go deep into the country. Well worth it.    Overall really nice hotel and I would go back.    My only moan....... is the airport! 2.5 hours to get through passport control on way in to the country and 2 hours to get back through on way out.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,BertieWertie wrote a review Dec 2018,40,The staff are the greatest asset!,We‚Äôve just returned home from a wonderful 6 nights at the Be Live Adults Only Marrakech. We had an excellent overall experience and we didn‚Äôt need to worry about the negative reviews because they‚Äôre not accurate.    The Pros and cons:    1. The staff are by far the greatest asset to the hotel. We didn‚Äôt get all the names but we wanted to send thanks to Mourad for looking after us so well at lunch and dinner times. Thanks also to Yousef Amine Maria Hisham Adil and Esdine. Every member of staff worked very hard to make you welcome and looked after.  2. The Lobby Bar is lovely for pre-dinner drinks and the staff work very hard to serve you quickly.  3. The animation team were all wonderful. We didn‚Äôt partake in the pool activities but they are very happy and enthusiastic. They also made a great effort for the Halloween celebrations dressing up to great effect and putting on a Halloween disco.  4. The pool area is lovely. We preferred the quiet pool with the swim up bar but used both pools.  5. The gardens and grounds are lovely and the staff are constantly working to make the area look so wonderful.  6. The food in the restaurant at breakfast lunch and dinner was lovely. There is a pasta station where the lovely lady (I didn‚Äôt get her name) would make the most delicious meals as per my preference.  7. The wine was delicious as was the cold local beer at lunch times.  8. The rooms are lovely and spacious perfectly appointed with comfy beds and pillows.  9. The cleaning staff work so hard to keep the rooms and the hotel very clean.  10. A selfish person kept walking around her room in high heels every morning in the room above us which kept waking us up. With hindsight we should have gone to the room and asked her not to do it. We didn‚Äôt contact the reception either instead deciding to just deal with it but bear this in mind if you get a ground floor room and please respect your neighbours below if you are on the first floor.  11. We loved the bathroom with dual sinks and a separate shower and bath.  12. The communal seating areas were very well kept and comfortable.  13. The sports bar was great with lots of comfortable seating and a friendly happy bar tender.  14. The free shuttle into the town centre was very convenient and we used it a couple of times to explore Marrakech.  15. We didn‚Äôt dine at the snack bar or the menu that required a reservation so cannot comment.  16. Not really cons but I‚Äôd say the smell in the toilet can be unpleasant but it wasn‚Äôt all the time and we took some food freshener because we expected this from the reviews.  17. The water in the pools was freezing and I found it too cold to use especially the quiet pool with the swim up. This was a real shame as I would have loved to spend time in the water but I found it so cold my body just couldn‚Äôt get used to it. The animated pool was warmer but not peaceful because of the activities.  18. The music at the animated pool was repetitive and consisted of dodgy cover versions of famous songs played on a loop. There would also be some local music or Asian inspired music which I didn‚Äôt enjoy although the music used for yoga was lovely and relaxing.  19. The spa treatments were very expensive. You also had to pay separately for the indoor pool which I think is wrong for a 5 star hotel.  20. Our rooms were not equipped with robes despite our booking saying we would have them. This is a bit trivial but when we asked for them we were told they are only placed in the swim-up rooms but as I say or hotels.com confirmation said they were in all rooms and in any event they should be in a 5 star hotel. We were eventually given robes but had to ask about 3 times.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BertieWertie

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Karen A wrote a review Nov 2018,50,Winter break,I always try and keep an open mind when reading reviews and prefer to make my own mind up.    The hotel is lovely the reception bar and restaurant areas are kept very clean. We were asked for the local tax and deposit at reception as mentioned by other travellers.    The room was really nice and spacious. Loads of wardrobe space and nice toiletries in the bathroom. We also has slippers and robes.    I had read on here a few reports about the shower flooding and it did happen to us on the first night. What we did work out if you didn't put the water on full the drains coped well with it the problem seems to be if you use the full water pressure. You don't need to you can still have a great shower. There was also a great full size bath with a shower attachment. The hotel supplies a good range of quality toiletries.    The Food in the restaurant was varied and good if you are looking to eat burger and chips then you can get this from the snack bar during the day. I loved being able to try new foods. It was out of season and quite busy I could see that in busy periods you could possible have to wait as it isn't that big compared the the size of the hotel.    The all inclusive drinks taste okay (which is a bonus)and they do serve them in nice glasses in the bar. They are not very strong so you just have to drink a few more!    The staff work really hard and they could probably do with a few more on the bar and in the restaurant.    We used the Spa as the weather wasn't great while we were there. We found the guy on the reception a little condescending he didn't really listen to what we wanted was only interested in pushing the expensive full packages. We booked a massage and I would say it was pretty average. Even thought they said you could use the indoor pool facilities they didn't really make you feel welcome to use them. When we asked for a Robe we were told we couldn't have one and they gave us a towel so we left and didn't use the pool.    We used the shuttle into the Medina that was pretty good but you need to book the day before as the places get filled quickly as there isn't anywhere local you can walk to.

The food was ok but very repetative and only luke warm and the snack bar food was poor quality and cold. The weather was very cold mid November and although not the hotels fault I do think there should have been some heating on and not air con blowing cool air out I couldn't wait to get home to get warm.

Cutlery was limited at times and you had to ask a member of staff for them once they had run out.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,dave4747 wrote a review Nov 2018,20,Not for everyone,Ill be honest this wasn‚Äôt the most expensive option and I knew 5* in Morocco wouldn‚Äôt be at the same standard as a 5* in other countries but here are my constructive thoughts around a hotel that does have potential to be excellent.    Rooms and beds are great although we had smelly drains towards the end of the stay (ground floor).  Lobby bar entertainment was poor and had an ‚Äòairport lounge‚Äô feel to it. Sports bar was ok.  Drinks were very good wine beer and spirits.  Main gripe was the food quality given there is nowhere else to go locally quality of the meat were cheap cuts. Fish tasted muddy and chicken thighs in tagine very dry. The food was often cold and had no flavour in the sauces. Everything was badly labelled so you didn‚Äôt know what you were eating. The serving tongues were shared amongst multiple dishes so unless you got there early the dishes were contaminated with other food.  A la carte restaurant food was limited to 2 menus and didn‚Äôt cater for vegetarians. The food served is traditional Moroccan. I wasn‚Äôt a fan I‚Äôm afraid. The snack bar food was probably the best option.  Some of the staff are excellent but some very slow and don‚Äôt seem to be great at multitasking and as a result service was generally slow throughout despite the hotel not being at full capacity.    Spa manager awful pushy sales technique and only interested on selling his most expensive product. Incredibly reluctant to even sell us two massages. Despite not explicitly stating it was cash only he wouldn‚Äôt even take card and insistent to a point of rudeness that we payed cash. We cancelled the treatment and took a day trip to Hotel la Mamounia in the centre and used their spa instead this included lunch massage and use of facilities all day for ¬£160. It was pricey but worth it and the best food we ate all week and genuinely has 5 stars.    Rooms were noisy due to the design of the hotel could hear the bloke upstairs all night wondering around drunk and people outside i.e Thin walls.    PS. Completely agree with the other reviewer regarding the puppies that the hotel management decided to abandon along with their mother in the middle of the desert 3 miles away at 6-8 weeks of age. I know there is an issue with rabies and dogs are not for everyone but this seemed very cruel. Thankfully you will be pleased to hear some other guests (Belgian i believe) teamed up and went to find the abandoned puppies they were successful and delivered them to a charity called ‚ÄúSPANA‚Äù to be cared for. We got news of this through the guys on the front gate.,Date of stay: November 2018,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dave4747

Fabulous staff always polite and smiling special mention to Omar Karim and Simo what wonderful examples you are to the young generation. Cleaning staff do a wonderful job bar etc cannot fault them.  Weather wasn‚Äôt great but still had a lovely time. Hope the man from Germany who had a heart attack in the bar makes a full recovery. He was enjoying himself after the entertaining belly dancing show dancing away!  Moans well ... the spa although nice is over priced. Although the buffet try to cater for all tastes it could have more variety.  Biggest moan which spoiled my holiday and spoiled others was the puppies! 5 beautiful friendly cuddly puppies and their mother by the hotel gates. Many of us were gutted when they were taken away and dumped in the desert! Please sterilize vaccinate and look after the animals born there including the gorgeous kittens. Bring the puppies back to their home sterilize them give them collars and dog houses at the side of the hotel away from possible moaning guests ( everyone loved them). Feed them there are enough left overs on plates. Set a precedent so animal lovers aren‚Äôt upset like many of us were. BRING BACK THE PUPPIES. (This is the reason for 4 stars and not 5).

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,tripper51 wrote a review Nov 2018,50,Wouldn't go in summer.,This review is for a stay in November. The hotel was nowhere near full and it was chilly most days. We normally go to the Riu Palmeraie next door but that was closed for a refurb.  My wife and I treat this 10 day trip not as a holiday but as a cheap getaway. We're not expecting 35c temperatures and so with 20c most days and a little rain it was as expected.  So the hotel. Staff were brilliant. Bar staff in the sports bar and lobby bar were great and despite being busy would ensure our glasses were filled constantly. That said the quality was a bit low.  Buffet was boring. Same food every day and nothing exciting. Omelette for breakfast burger or pizza for lunch and pasta for dinner was the best I could put together. The restaurant itself was too small and there were never enough tables. Dread to think how they manage when it's busy. Staff again worked very hard but struggled to keep up with cleaning tables and getting drinks.  Rooms were spotless with the best bed I think I've ever slept in. Lenny Henry should check these out! How a 5* hotel gets away with no kettle and coffee I don't understand but as long as you are aware you can take your own. Also pack toilet rolls. Two supplied are not enough.  Two pools and the party pool was heated and getting in was OK. But getting out meant freezing so we'll skip that.  As the hotel was empty the entertainment was in the lobby bar every night. Live music or a DJ got many up and dancing but it was loud very loud VERY VERY LOUD. Blimey turn it down a bit please. Talking was just impossible.  During our stay a guest had what I understand was a heart attack in the lobby bar. Whilst the staff did deal with it in a calm manner there seemed to be no first aid trained member of staff on duty. I'm glad to report that from what I was told the gentleman made a full recovery. We wish him well.  Free coach to the town centre. Why oh why does it drop off in a different place to every other coach? Neither the front desk nor the Tui rep were helpful either. Hop on Hop off bus the Tui rep didn't even know there was one! I've put a post on Q&A to help as a reference.  To sum up it is a cheap get-away and as such I have little to moan about. The queues for the buffet and no room in the lobby at night would put me off returning. It's back to the Riu next door for us.  Nothing to do with the hotel but the airport. Oh my God get it sorted. 80 minutes to get in to the country nearly two hours to get out. We arrived at the airport on our return at 9:45 for a 12:05 flight. We got through security checkin security another check more security and then passport control at 11:35. This meant a dash through duty free and on to the plane with minutes to spare. Many people begging to jump the passport queue through no fault of their own but their plane was leaving shortly.,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Brighton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tripper51

The amenities room food and bar/restaurant staff were superb.    However the after service given by the hotel is non-existent. Despite confirming at check out that the room and towel deposit we were required to pay at the start of our stay had been returned months on the hotel are still actually yet to return this. I have sent multiple emails to hotel directly and to the main chain's customer service team but I haven't received any replies. I've also rang my bank to see if there is an issue on their side however they have confirmed the money was taken as an actual payment (rather than a holding deposit) and no refunds are stuck in a process (which is another excuse the hotel has given to other customers on this website).    The lack of response by the hotel on this issue is extremely disappointing and it is wholly unacceptable for the hotel to hold money that is not rightly theirs.    Hopefully if this message is read the hotel will provide me contact details of someone who will actually respond to me and refund my payment accordingly!!!,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellebG3774AN
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Khush's Travels wrote a review Nov 2018,40,All inclusive 2 nights,Airport:  We flew with BA to marrakesh Menara airport and this was a pleasant flight. I had read previous reviews around the heavy queuing system at Menara airport and the previous reviews were 100% correct. Once we landed we had to complete a form and wait in a que for approx 1 hour. My advice would be to carry pens with you jump in the que and then complete your form.    Once past security there was another que to put all luggage through security this also took an hour. Be prepared!!    Our transfer was ready and waiting for us and the journey to the hotel was short approx 25minutes - this was hassle free.    Hotel  Once at the Hotel the check in process was fairly straight forward. We were expected to pay tax and give a card for holding purposes.    We were given our room keys and made our way to our Suite on the first floor.    Our Suite was absolutely wonderful. We were a group of 3 and the cleaner had kindly set up a single bed for the third person.    The suite was spotlessly clean it consisted of two rooms (one living space area and one bedroom). The bedroom contained a double bed and tv and the living space consisted of a toilet sofas dining table single bed table with coffee mugs and a coffee machine (but not kettle or milk! which was a pain and pretty pointless). Complimentary water was provided in the fridge.    Overall the living space was really lovely the beds were super comfortable and the hotel offered heating and AC which was perfect this time of year. The evenings were slightly cold and the afternoons were warm.    Food  Being vegetarians (who do not eat egg) we really struggled with food at lunch and dinner time. During the snack times the hotel offered Margarita pizzas club sandwiches and chips - this was sufficient for us however by day 3 we really struggled!    During dinner and lunch times we mainly ate bread and pasta which was made by the lovely lady chef. However the pasta didn't taste the best and we put this down to the really strong herbs!    Souks  We booked onto the free bus service to the Souk Market in the old town. The bus service was in fact a really comfortable coach.    Once at the old town we were approach by a man with a Bike who told us he was a chef from the BE LIVE COLLECTION hotel and that he recognised us. We assumed that he was! He then said he could recommend a nice restaurant in the old town with good hygiene and perfect for us. He also repeatedly mentioned seeing the fresh argan oil shop! he was quite pushy and insisted we followed him.    After 10minutes of walking with him we decided something wasn't right and we decided to divert back to the Souk market.    When we returned back to the hotel another traveller also mentioned that this had also happened to her! The man was NOT a chef at the BE LIVE!    Souk  The Souk market was insanely busy in the evening on a saturday and we felt uncomfortable walking around. There were lots of men staring and generally not a nice atmosphere. The roads to the Souks were busy and it was extremely difficult to cross the road. We didn't stay long we headed straight back to the hotel where we felt safe.    Airport Return  Our transfer collected us at 1pm for a 4.20 flight.  We qued for over 2 and a half hours.. all flights were then delayed and we just about made our flight!    The staff at Marrakesh airport were rude and there was only one man managing the queing system of over 1000 people. ridiculous. It was actually quite scary as people were angry in the ques people had missed their flights and wanted to jump the ques which made other people late!    We had to run to catch our flight!

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Lucy J wrote a review Nov 2018,50,Excellent new hotel with good food and drinks!,We stayed for 5 nights in October.    The weather was still lovely and warm so we were able to make full use of the pool. The pool bar was our favourite and we grew very attached to the local stork beer they were providing us with. The white wine was also quite nice.    We had a swim up pool room which doesn‚Äôt connect to the pool unfortunately but is still really nice to have a little dip in outside the room.    The food is mostly buffet but it has a large selection of choice. For breakfast they can cook fresh omelettes and dinner they have a different meat dish. If you stay for more than 4 nights you can reserve a table in the a la cart restaurant which is a traditional Moroccan restaurant. The food is really good.    The room was modern and comfortable. Spent time in the relaxing when the sun was really hot.    The evening entertainment was pretty good but sometimes went on quite late some nights but it is adult only so to be expected.    I really liked this hotel. Would recommend for a few days but longer than a week you could get bored.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LucyJayne36
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Getaway422156 wrote a review Nov 2018,50,Wonderful holiday in the winter sun,We stayed at this hotel on an all inclusive holiday arranged with TUI. The hotel is newly built and is lovely. The rooms were fantastic and the bed was huge and so very comfortable. I had the best sleep I have had for ages. Everywhere around the hotel was spotless and we were very well looked after. The TUI rep Danielle was brilliant and went out of her way to help us with appropriate excursion selection and local advice and even sourced some large plasters to help cover a wound incurred at the airport.    The food was just lovely. We can be a bit a bit difficult as we are both vegetarians but there were plenty of options for us at each meal and the catering staff were there to answer questions to help us select the meat free dishes. The food was very varied with plenty of Morrocan dishes to choose from (why come all the way to Morroco to eat international food) and joy of joys there were no chips available in the buffet restaurant although these were available from the pool snack bar. The waiting staff were very attentive topping up drinks and removing plates promptly. Abde Samad in particular needs a special mention for the warm smile and welcome he gave us at breakfast and lunch every day his attention to detail was excellent. Hassan was excellent in the evening too. The Morrocan wine was lovely too and the French pastries were to die for.    Bar staff were generally very attentive but more variable. We preferred to drink at the lobby bar as drinks were served in glasses rather than plastic as at the pool bar. Local spirits were not as good as the wine but then we were in Morroco wehre spirits are not drunk locally so this was no surprise    Marrakech was fabulous full of colour and life. The shuttle bus was excellent and we used it most days except when on a TUI excursion.    The only downside was the relentless queuing at the airport inbound and outbound. But we had a wonderful holiday and have lots of photos and memories. Thank you to the hotel staff and to TUI.,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Getaway422156
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Ciara wrote a review Nov 2018,40,"Great hotel, very enjoyable stay",I stayed here with two friends for 5 nights and was very pleasantly surprised especially after reading some of the negative reviews before going. We were very happy with the hotel and happy to recommend to other travellers.  The hotel & grounds are all spotlessly clean the rooms extremely modern and comfortable. We had a swim up room which was nice for the view/ambience but it didn't get the sun until later in afternoon so we never actually used the sun loungers. There is a window between the room and the bathroom so it is a bit awkward as one can see into the shower. We had to use the pool towels to create a bit of privacy!  We enjoyed the food for the most part there was a huge range at breakfast lunch and dinner. They struggled to keep the food warm but we just made sure to get the food as it came hot off the grill or else we had the pasta which they would make on the spot.  The pizzas were lovely too. We had lunch in the snack bar two days but in the end preferred the buffet as you could make up your own salads.  The restaurant staff are amazing work so hard and always pleasant and helpful.  The animation team were great really enjoyed the aqua aerobics yoga and stretching classes. They do work hard to keep everyone entertained.  The one issue we had a problem with was the Spa. The facilities are really lovely and the treatments great however there was a hassle trying to get the 10% discount we were entitled to for booking direct with hotel. They would not accept the booking proof on the phone and instead we had to pay the full amount then go back to reception wait in queue then ask them to print out our booking & go back to Spa to get the 10% refund which would only be issued by the manager so we had to return a couple of times before we got him. Surely it would be simpler for the hotel to issue a voucher upon check-in or else the Spa accept the online reservation. It was an annoying hassle that should be easily avoided.  The other annoying thing was the Spa insisted on cash payment upfront however we heard from other guests that they took credit card if pushed. Deliberately lying to guests about the possible payment methods is a bizarre customer service strategy and not one that fits in with a 5 star hotel (although I agree hotel is more 4 star)  The music in the bar was very good lots of people up dancing but loud on some nights. However there was the option of the sports bar if the party music is not your thing.  I thought the reception staff were friendly and helpful although it did take us by surprise that we had to pay the full amount upon checkin and not checkout which would be more normal practice.  Overall I would recommend this hotel especially if you are looking for a reasonably priced 4 star adults only hotel .,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dublingirl32
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Moj C wrote a review Nov 2018,50,This hotel is great but the staff are Phenomenal,We were a couple staying for 7 nights.    I want to start this off with something about me. I'm an anxious and slightly paranoid individual. New places tend to frighten me and I take a while to get used to it.    So when I say how unbelievably comfortable and welcome I felt when staying at this hotel you'll know the level I'm talking about.    Hotel Grounds: Always kept to a high standard. Clean well kept and stunning.    Reception: Always on hand to help you. I've read many reviews that say they are rude and I've got to disagree. They are very friendly and helpful but from what I've seen they simply do not take anyones sh*t. Which I personally applaud as some people can be very entitled.    Rooms: THE BEDS ARE SO COMFY. Rooms are a great size lots of wardrobe space and a safe that's free to use. Ours came with a bath and a shower which was great the bath was so deep that my 6ft 8 partner could even fit in it! Only thing is the window between the bathroom and the bedroom. Toilet has its own little room so that's fine but if the blinds are shut you can still see into the bathroom when the lights on so for example if it isn't a couple staying together it may get a tad awkward. Housekeeping kept the rooms so fresh throughout our stay and even tidied up after my messy self.    Buffet Restaurant: Food was fantastic and always made to a great standard great choice throughout the day. The deserts were the real winner though so yummy. Staff incredibly attentive and friendly. I would recommend going to dinner earlier rather than later as it can get quite busy later on and on occasion you need to queue for a table but never for longer than 5 minutes.    Lobby Bar: We stopped by every day for coffee and drinks. Really comfortable and the staff again were very attentive and super friendly. Cocktails were great I would recommend the Marrakech Flower and the Atlas Lion. They often had a band or a singer and guitarist at night and they were always wonderful.    Snack Bar: First and foremost you should go here for lunch ALWAYS. Best burger I've ever had and we had a late breakfast here a couple of times and my partner says it's the best cheese omelet he's ever eaten. I've seen a couple of reviews on here that say the staff are rude. This is untrue they are still very friendly and if they aren't smiling it's because they are the most consistently busy serving staff throughout the day and surrounded by wasps as it's outside so I cannot blame them. They were still lovely and I think anyone who thinks they are rude just need to get over themselves.    Spa: I went for a californian massage which was super relaxing. The whole Spa area is incredibly chilled and calming and the ladies I spoke to were very helpful and friendly.    Pools: Honestly we didn't spend any time at the quiet pool. We tried once but it had no atmosphere and the pool is not heated. The activity pool however always had music playing and activities going on and the pool is heated (you could even see the steam coming off it on the cold mornings!) We took part in the archery a couple of times which was very fun. Got to hand it to the activity team they were all so bubbly and always encouraged everyone to get involved but never pushy. We never took part in the aqua aerobics but it looked great and a lot of fun.    Another note is that the TUI rep on hand was fantastic. She was very friendly and incredibly helpful.    There's a lot more I could say on this hotel but this is already quite an essay. If we ever return to Morocco we will without a doubt return to this hotel.,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mojcameron
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Radu N wrote a review Nov 2018,30,Good hotel,We stayed 7 nights here.  The hotel was far from anything and we had to book a taxi to get to the centre.  We also booked a transfer from hotel to the markets and it was all ok.  People in the market are very pushy.  Also the guy from spa is pushy to sell you some treatments and when you come to the spa he is not that nice anymore.  Reception girls were quite rude  there was just 1 pleasant receptionist.  Cocktails in the place didnt taste amazing.  I really enjoyed the white wine they had.  Pool was too cold for me so i could not swim.  Food was lovely and there is a pool bar too which offers burgers and different food to the main bar.  Would prefer to visit another hotel if i would come again.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/359radkan

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Jessica T wrote a review Nov 2018,50,Amazing hotel - ignore all the bad reviews!,I was really wary about coming to this hotel after reading all the negative reviews but coming from a very fussy person who is a bit of a clean freak i was very pleasantly surprised - it was amazing!!! I'm going to give a detailed review to hopefully help others with the bits i was a bit anxious about before travelling!    We changed a bit of our money at Gatwick airport into Moroccan dirham so we had some for the taxi (really bad exchange rate!!) then changed most of our money at the hotel which was a much better rate. Not that we needed much as after food drink and shuttle bus are free we didn't feel the need to spend much more!    We got a taxi from the airport (there are loads waiting right outside the airport) they will try and charge around 400 dirham but try and haggle them down a bit. It took around 20 mins to get to the hotel. For the way back the hotel offer a taxi service which is 250 dirham we booked this through reception and they turned up on time and a bit less stressful than trying to haggle your own taxi!    We had a swim up superior double room which i would definitely recommend as its so nice being able to sunbathe on your own balcony if you don't fancy going to the busier pools. The room was amazing really big clean and comfortable and the bathroom was lovely. (If there is a slight smell it was only in the toilet section which is separate from the bath/shower anyway so really not a big deal!!)    The whole hotel is beautiful the grounds and gardens are lovely and the staff are working so hard 24/7 to make sure its always clean. All of the staff are really friendly and go out of their way to help you in any way they can.    The food in the main buffet was amazing different stuff out for breakfast lunch and dinner and different dishes every day. Lots of Moroccan food and all sorts of other food pizza pasta salads so there will be something for everyone. The desserts are the best part amazing pastries and cakes every day! You can also get food most of the day at the pool bar which is also really good food. The drinks were all really nice all sorts of cocktails on offer and they would pretty much make you anything you fancied!    The free shuttle bus from the hotel into the town was really helpful. They drop you off and pick you up near the Koutoubia mosque which is good because you can see that from all over town as its the tallest building. They always turned up on time just book it through reception the day before so you can guarantee a place on it.    Overall an amazing new clean and stylish hotel away from the craziness of the main town centre! Would 100% return to this hotel!,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Cuba,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicatI606PB
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,thispoint wrote a review Nov 2018,40,Nice and with a few extras could be excellent,The hotel has been built in a way that makes it feel very comfortable with lovely landscaping. There are two pools one of which is a quiet pool. The downside is that they are not heated and are freezing cold. They both have bars but the one by the quiet pool was closed for the days when the day started off a little cloudy.  The staff in the restaurant are excellent. There is a wide selection on food which was high quality.  The drinks were ok. Nice touch to have Morrocan wine sparking would be nice as well.  The hotel was really clean and the rooms were comfortable it would be nice to be able to make tea and coffee in the room.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Carol2000 wrote a review Nov 2018,40,Book it,We were not sure what to expect as some of the reviews were negative and pointing out it is not 5 * hotel.  It is not.  It is All Inclusive holiday hotel with a solid 4 *.  Positives - lovely gardens great hotel's interiors large rooms and bathrooms overall v. clean good pools nice people. Food was good. Could be better as the meats were mainly overcooked and dry the same about fish. Lots of fruits good selection of veg and Moroccan dishes FABULOUS desserts and a good selection of bread. Omelettes pancakes and eggs cooked for you. The same about pasta dishes.Wine good Cocktails weak but hey you want to enjoy yourself not drop dead. Shuttle bus to the city - convenient. Quiet cold ( I call it refreshing ) pool with a bar. More entertainment at the larger heated up pool. A nice atmosphere. Felt safe and relaxed. Staff working hard in the restaurant. Anyone complaining it is not 5* - just remind yourself how much did you pay and reflect on that.  Note to the management -  why you check the booking documents from travel companies if clearly you have the details of the guests and you just need a passport to check them in. It creates time-consuming unnecessary wait at the check-in after spending HOURS at the immigration at the airport. Plus - no one has them printed out anyway.  Extremely rude and unpleasant man at the Snack Bar - He turned to me after serving someone else and shaking his chin to me said - yyyh - I understand he just said in his own language - Hello what would you like ?. Then just made coffee and whacked it on the front of me without saying anything turned his back.  Maids ( early morning ) throwing buckets of soapy water on the corridor's floor to clean it. Guests slipping all over it - an accident waiting to happen.  Entertainment -  Monday (12 Nov ) night band was excellent put them upstairs in the main hall and call it Disco night.  White Night - was good - take the DJ upstairs and call it Dancing Night.  The lowest point was Latino Night. I'm sorry to say that it was absolutely embarrassing and painful to watch. So we left.    Overall - GOOD. There is a potential to be Very Good but you need a strong management and staff training. Service is more important than endless floor polishing. Then you can charge more and employ more staff.  Good luck!,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Austin, Texas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carol2000carol
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Matthew F wrote a review Nov 2018,40,A diamond that needs a tiny bit of polishing,After reading some negative reviews before arriving we was slightly apprehensive about arriving. However once we arrived we was pleasantly surprised. The hotel is itself is beautiful from the lobby to the rooms it‚Äôs all perfectly designed and extremely clean. There is always someone cleaning. The rooms are luxurious and spacious the beds are wonderfully big and they ensure a good nights sleep (This was a comment I heard many guests say during our trip). The staff are extremely friendly and helpful I must mention the entertainment team of SimoTitif and the gang (I forgot all the other names) they had a great attitude and done a great job of keeping everyone entertained during the stay. There‚Äôs much to do around the pool including aqua aerobics and table tennis. The only real negative thing to mention would be the poor quality of food served in the buffet restaurant. Most items are rarely hot and there is not much variety across the week. This is again something that many people mentioned hopefully they are able to sort this issue out in time for next summer. However the food served at the pool bar during the day is much nicer it offers burgers and chips panini‚Äôs and sandwiches.

Very plush newly opened hotel beautiful rooms and excellent maid service. Food good and plenty of choice dining room not large enough and at busy times people were having to queue. Not enough staff in the dining room and usually only one bar man on which caused long queues at the bar. Attitude of staff mixed bit upset that on arrival at an all inclusive hotel we were asked for our credit card so they could take ¬£90.00 returnable deposit in case of damage to hotel or loss of towels! Staff on snack bar not the friendliest with no customer service more training needed.

Everything is immaculate and cared for. The grounds and gardens are amazing and the rooms cannot be faulted any small issues were sorted promptly. The beds and pillows are very comfy and it was very quiet where we stayed although the view wasn't great.  The food in the main restaurant was great and lots of choice and the snack bar was decent too. The decor in the restaurant was lovely but and although this is no fault of the staff who work tirelessly when the hotel was full you could wait a while for service. The hotel has 2 very different pools areas one quiet with a swim-up bar and the other lively with lots of activities. Entertainment is hit and miss but everything can't be to everyone's taste so at least it was varied. Drinks and cocktails were fine.  The hotel has a free shuttle bus which runs about 4 times per day into the centre of Marrakesh which takes about 25 mins. Best time to go is late afternoon and enjoy the street food at the Jemaa-El-Fnaa square and stay until it gets dark and watch the entertainers etc. Must add that it is very very busy there but well worth it.  Staff at the hotel are all very helpful and shout-outs to Mohammed and Mouhrad in the main restaurant and Hafid who never stops with the drinks in the Lobby Bar.

I think the restaurant and bar were our biggest let down as they are quite small for a hotel of this size. The first night we had to wait over 40 minutes and past the 10 o‚Äôclock closing time to be seated to eat. The food was nice but nothing spectacular.  The pool and grounds are stunning and we enjoyed lounging by the quiet pool or swimming up to the bar.  The bar which serves food needs more staff. Two of us waited an hour for 2 pizzas.  Entertainment at night is quiet. The lobby bar doesn‚Äôt have a lot of seating but the staff were friendly. The main evening entertainment sounded great but it‚Äôs on the 1st floor so out of the way. when we looked in each night there was less than 10 people in there and no bar.  like someone else said it wouldn‚Äôt take a lot to make it a great hotel but it‚Äôs just not there yet.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,uk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stewpotUk

The hotel itself is beautifully designed with fabulous gardens all around a couple of pools with plenty of sun lounges several bars serving drinks and food throughout the day a spa gym and a variety of both daytime activities and night time entertainment if you fancy it.The staff are wonderfully attentive and friendly all the way through from reception to the maids and gardeners. The place is absolutely spotless there are people cleaning and tending to the grounds constantly and all are so welcoming and helpful.The hotel itself is quite isolated but there is a shop on site and you could quite easily never leave the complex if you didn't want to. If you do want to explore there is a free bus into the city which you can book at reception which will take you to the famous markets of Marrakech - you will almost certainly get lost in the souks but this is half the fun and the Moroccan people are very friendly and will point you in the right direction.We had a hammam and massage treatment in the hotel spa which was wonderful. The ladies in the spa really seemed to care about making your experience enjoyable. I would say - don't be put off by the spa manager he was quite pushy in trying to get us to go for a much larger spa package which was simply out of our budget and time constraints. Our treatment lasted an hour and a half and included a steam in the steam room a scrub with traditional black soap - made during the process of extracting the locally made argan oil a full body mud mask and a wonderful massage. This cost 600 dirhams each which is around 60gbp and well worth it. Try to book with one of the ladies in the spa rather than the manager as he wouldn't even discuss with us the simpler treatments which was a bit off-putting.We booked with Thomas Cook who also provided a variety of excursions which were excellent. We visited the Majorelle gardens and did a full day excursion to the Atlas mountains and would recommend both. Our guide for the Atlas mountain trip Haseem made the day a delight. He was very informative and friendly and really showcased the Moroccan people's friendliness and sense of humour.Overall I would highly recommend the Be Live Collection we had a wonderfully relaxing stay with just the right amount of adventure!,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wanderer32307205588

They were amazing! All the guys Simo Salim fati TitifKarim and Ibrahim. All of them really made the day and nights enjoyable. I would definitely give them 5 stars!!    Regarding food. I am vegetarian so this is a little biased. They didn't really have much options besides pizza pasta salads and maybe a few vegetables. I am quite easy going but if you are a pure vegetarian I would be careful as they double dip from meat dishes to vegetarian.    The al a carte restaurant we went to didn't have any vegetarian option and they couldn't make me one either. I would have thought being a five star hotel they would definitely have this option its not anything new that some people are vegetarian.    Im just being a little picky now but poolside bar service would be a good touch as most five star hotels I have been to have poolside bar staff.    The one suggestion I would really hope they take on board is to hire more staff. They are definitely short staffed and just for us to get our drinks during any meal has been about 8-10Mins sometimes and its not due to staff being lax its due to there not being enough staff. The staff in the dining area really do work hard and at times I did feel bad for them. Also at the bar we would have to wait in queue as there was only one staff serving at the bar.    The rooms are super clean and lovely. They are big and spacious.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Dollydollop wrote a review Oct 2018,30,An honest review of the hotel - Please read- It may take you a while!!!,"I've just returned after a week at this hotel with my daughter. Oh my what a catalogue of disasters! Firstly let's start with the positives - and there are a lot. The staff are all extremely courteous helpful friendly willing and happy but there just aren't enough of them. They are run off their feet and therefore when you request a drink or coffee or a pot of tea they forget and you have to ask again and sometimes again. The main pool is superb - freezing but superb. Plenty of sunbeds plenty of parasols for shade and a very attentive poolman/lifeguard who appears magically to move your parasol the minute you lay a finger on it to do so yourself. The activities pool is great but noisy. Every half hour there is something going on and it's accompanied by loud music!! The rooms are a good size clean well fitted and have the most comfortable beds I've ever experienced in a hotel. The curtains are black out and the rooms are generally quiet so you are not disturbed. We were unfortunate enough to have an elephant in hobnail boots in the room above ours and he also loved moving the furniture around at 1am 3am and 5am as well as at various times throughout the day - I will be intrigued until the end of my days by what he/she/they were actually doing in that room!!! But I spent a day in bed when I was ill and the noise drove me mad.  And then we come to the restaurant....... the food has to have been the most mediocre food ever served up in a 5 star hotel. Yes I know it's an all inclusive and you can't expect gourmet cooking but I can expect food to be properly cooked and free of bacteria that resulted in my spending a day in bed so poorly that my daughter got the doctor out and he diagnosed gastro enteritis. The incubation for this is maximum of 48 hours and I got it after we'd been in the hotel for longer than that so the hotel had to be the source. Also one of the main causes is people not washing their hands after visiting the loo and then touching food. I didn't see anyone leaving the toilets with unwashed hands but I did witness one chef serving at one of the stations turn and sneeze all over the countertop behind him then turn back and carry on serving!!! (No one came and cleaned the countertop - the area that they serve to the stations from.) Every meal there was an identical menu - lunch and dinner were indiscernable from each other. The meat was tough and over cooked in some cases or as in the case of the veal liver raw and bloody. I had prawns that were either dried up and shrivelled or decidedly undercooked and with the vein (or poo pipe!) still intact and a whole salmon put out for one of the meals (could have been lunch or dinner - see comment above) was decidedly underdone. Therefore I am confident that the restaurant was the source of my illness. But if they didn't get you with food poisoning they got you in other ways. My daughter bit into a pastry and something sharp cut her gum. On examination she found a shard of metal in her mouth that had come from the pastry!  So by now we were getting pretty fed up. We had asked the Reception to investigate the elephants in the room above on three occasions but nothing had been done. They promised to send the doctor within the hour but forgot to ring him so it was two hours before he arrived. The final straw or so we thought at the time was the metal in the pastry. I was still confined to bed so my daughter went and saw the restaurant manager (we nicknamed him Mr Bean as he had a definite air of that character about him) and the other hotel manager (or so we thought). He said he was very sorry about our issues but it was above his pay grade to deal with it (or words to that effect) and that we would speak to the General Manager but he mentioned that he would look into getting us upgraded to a suite when I was able to move. Again nothing happened. Then the best bit of all! We went on our 5th night to the hotels' special restaurant - you are only allowed to dine their once for free during your stay. We were really looking forward to a decent meal at last and dressed up for the occasion. We each chose - one of us Menu 1 and the other Menu 2 - and sat back in anticipation (next to a guy wearing flipflops and cut off denim shorts (he'd REALLY made an effort to look good!!!!). They brought our first courses - mine a mussel soup and my daughter's a vegetable soup. My soup was tepid hers was hotter. It was quite tasty though so I forgave them the temperature. Then my daughter picked up the sweet sticky pastry that they served with her soup (?). Well we both nearly collapsed in hysterics when she discovered the black bee that had been baked into it! I mean if it were a book people would say it was too far fetched. No two people could have that many calamities on one holiday. I promise you reader we did!. We discreetly put the offending pastry in a serviette and into our bag and didn't make a scene in the restaurant. The rest of the meal came but it was grim. My beef tagine was just that - beef. Nothing else just beef. No onions no potatoes no vegetables.....just beef! The dessert was a selection of pastries - without bees as far as we could see but by then we were so fed up with the food we left - not the only people to leave early I might add.  We went and found the manager (not Mr Bean but the hotel manager (who told us that he was actually the manager of the other Be Live hotel in Marrakech the 4 star one!). He looked appropriately sheepish said how embarrassed he was and admitted that there was a lot of room for improvement. He promised faithfully to speak to the General Manager the next morning and report back to us. They had already promised us a room upgrade which failed to materialise so we didn't really hold out a lot of hope but HE PROMISED!!! The next morning he was conspicuously absent from the hotel as indeed he was for the rest of the day. We caught up with Mr Bean and my daughter  who is five months pregnant was by now so totally frustrated with the whole charade that she burst into tears and ran off back to our room (the one that hadn't been upgraded). I told Mr Bean I would speak to him tomorrow. Tomorrow came and we were going home. Mr Bean studiously avoided us in the restaurant that morning as we had our last and routinely boring breakfast. However I went and tracked him down hiding out in the poolside bar. He started telling me that he had tried to speak to the General Manager and that it was all out of his hands etc etc but I just told him to shut up! I told him that I knew very well as did he that they had never had any intention at all of offering us any form of compensation for the events that befell us. He started huffing and puffing and I told him again that all they had done was stall us with worthless promises until it was too late for them to do anything about it. I suggested to him that they would maybe like to allow us to keep our room for the day rather than checking out at 12 noon as our fight was a late evening one and we didn't have to leave the hotel until 6pm. I also suggested that they might like to provide us with a free shuttle service to the airport rather than charging us the 35 Euros they normally charged. Again he had to talk to ""De Management"" and sat me down at the PR desk. 5 minutes later a delightful and highly embarrassed young lady came and sat down and apologised profusely for the problems we had had and said that they would comply with my request.......as long as I signed an affidavit saying I wouldn't seek further compensation from them!!!! I wrote and signed a letter saying that I accepted the offer of the room extension and free taxi as 'a gesture of good faith' but did not comment on not seeking further compensation.  I will write to Be Live but hold out absolutely no hope at all of getting a reply let alone any compensation (it would be nice if they would at least offer to pay my ¬£70 doctor's bill as with a ¬£50 excess it's not worth my while claiming off my insurance.  So to sum up the Be Live Marrakech Adults Only All inclusive has the potential to be a fabulous hotel but until it meets that potential be prepared to be disappointed. If you go along expecting to be ill and willing to eat the same mediocre food every morning noon and night you will have a great holiday. If however you are looking something that lives up to it's 5 tar rating and ¬£1000+ per couple price tag (plus flights) I would strongly advise you to look elsewhere.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,T0G0Away wrote a review Oct 2018,30,Can't be above a 3 star hotel,Disappointed really isn't the word I'm going to try and summarise this nicely for you...    THE HOTEL  - really isn't to the standards of a 5 star I don't care what country it's in. They really are conning people with that.  The shower in our room had 4 points from which it was leaking throughout our whole stay. Whenever the room above us would use water it would start leaking & the sound would echo through the bathroom. Even closing the door didn't help with the noise! After it would leak there was a horrible horrible smell that would fill the whole room. We complained to staff twice & the solution was to repair it. Which they didn't do because it carried on!  Also I can't believe how thin the walls are every morning we could hear upstairs and what sounded like an elephant stomping about! Notto mention the noise from construction no more than 20 metres away from the room.  Rooms are adequate no tea or coffee making facilities & the fridge in the room hardly works. I'm also abit confused why they would have 2 double beds in the room when it's an adults only & we booked a room with 1 bed.  Pool area is nice as is the buffet & bar everything is kept very clean and tidy.  Personally I loved the food it was the one thing that they got right! However in the onsite restaurant the food was shockingggggg!! & when I asked for a vegetarian menu the solution was to bringme food from the buffet...If I wanted that I Would've gone myself.  Drinks are absolute garbage!! I know most all inclusive places have cheap alcohol but when somewhere is advertised as a 5 star you expect more than petrol vodka!  Don't even bother with the 'entertainment' It's actually laughable how shocking it is!    THE STAFF  Pretty much if you don't speak French...or aren't a single woman...you won't have much luck from the staff here. The reception staff are unbelievably rude & I would go as far to say even stuck up. The lad that works during the night is lovely! He checked us in promptly and professiaonlly & the others could learn a thing or 2 from him.  As for the restaurant & bar staff I'd say 50/50. Some went above and beyond helpful & some were awful. The lad that makes the shisha& the main bar man in the evening were class. So helpful and polite we were so happy to give them a little something extra to say thank you.    Overall...never again. Even the couple in the room next to us said the 4 star Be Live was so much better than this one & they regret booking it.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T0G0Away
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Di W wrote a review Oct 2018,50,Don't believe the negative reviews!,"Food choice & quality excellent. Every kind of food imaginable on offer & different every lunch & evening. I don't normally eat desserts .... but these were so superb that I could not resist them!!    Food in the main restaurant was much better than the special restaurant you could book to eat in once if you're staying for more than 4 nights. We were NOT impressed with the food there. The beef was gristly with a lot of fat on it . The ""cockerel"" was a poussin & the chicken was tough & difficult to cut off the bones. I gave up in the end with that! You could always go into the main restaurant afterwards to have some good food!! We thought the wine offered was very drinkable & always topped up when needed! Choice of red rose or white. I normally do not have any ice in countries like Morocco to avoid tummy troubles. I had ice all the time & no problems. If you go to the same table or area in the restaurant every day you get to know the waiters & waitresses really well & they are very attentive!!    We had to eat inside as there were so many smokers at the hotel & they had to eat outside. It is a pity a non smoking area outside could not be allocated???    Room excellent. We had the cheapest room - garden view. Would not want a pool view room as we go to bed early & the entertainments may be a little noisy that side. Our room had two double beds. Free safe - easy to use. The bathroom was very spacious with two basins shower & bath gel body lotion & shampoo. There was a large bath & a large shower with a glass door. Our shower door let water leak into the bathroom so we angled the shower heads towards the wall & no leakage. However when we mentioned it at reception a man came & installed a tiled ledge the same day so no water could escape through the gap at the bottom of the shower door. All you have to do is mention a problem you may have & it will be dealt with!!    The animation team boys worked hard all day. Not quite sure why the girl was employed - the animation manager did not appear to give her much to do apart from chatting to her favourite guests most of the day!!    Two large pools & loads of sun loungers & shades. No need to get up at dawn to reserve your place!!!    At check in you have to give them your credit card details to take a refundable deposit of 1000 DAM for your room & 2 pool towels. You also have to pay the local tax when you check in. No problems with all of that. Credit card slip just returned to you unused when you leave.    If you have a late flight home they will give you a room to use to shower & change before leaving the hotel.

Food was good...good variety every day with different options available.    Rooms were clean and spacious. However as other people have said the shower is badly designed and does flood the whole bathroom! No ameinities as standard like kettle iron etc. As you would expect in any standard of 5* room.    Reception staff were pleasant but not very attentive of you waiting.    Snack bar a good option out of main meal time. However on the last day the burger was verryy rare so specify how you your food.    Overall a good mini break.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,UncletravellingMac wrote a review Oct 2018,40,Loved it!,After reading some of the negative reviews I really didn't know what to expect. Now after our stay I really can't understand what some people are moaning about.  The hotel staff were absolutely fantastic. Reception staff were smiling helpful and could understand enough English to assist us with any of our queries.  Food was great. We only stayed 3 days so it was not long enough to become repetitive however I did notice many people piling their plates with small portions of everything so no wonder you would get bored of the food if your there for 2 weeks. Just have one dish at a time if that worries you.....who eats lasagnewith chips cous cous salad and fish normally at home??  Desserts were great. I've stayed at a few all inclusives in Eqypt/ Turkey and desserts always look better than they taste however at this hotel they were delicious. Always managed to get our drinks topped up during meals and never had to wait too long for a drink but I don't think waiting 10 mins for a drink too much of a hardship anyway.  Room was fine. Comfortable quiet and clean. There was a slight smell in the bathroom when we first arrived but it disappeared after a few hours. We had stayed somewhere else in Marrekech before coming here with the same issue so I think it's a bit of a widespread problem but had it persisted I have no doubt the problem would have been resolved.  Entertainment was good. Had we stayed longer we would have used the free transfer bus into the main square at night to break up the evenings as its only about 20 mins away and a great experience. On that note the transfer bus runs throughout the day in and out of the main centre of Marrekech which is a great bonus.  The best bit in my opinion are the animation team especially Simo and Karim. Great fun and make everyone of all ages feel welcome to join in the activities without making you feel pressured. There is a fitness programme of aqua aerobics ( my favourite)  pilates yoga zumba and spinning aswell as game competitions such ping pong and darts.  If music and fun isn't your thing there is a quiet pool on the other side which is well....very quiet! There is a pool bar there aswell which is great for a cold beer.  Tbh we were happy with the local beer which was good so can't really comment on cocktails.  The only rudeness we came across was from the guests which unfortunately I'm embarrassed to say were from the U.K each time. Rude to staff and unrealistic expectations. One couple had a moan about arriving at 10am in the morning but not being able to check in till after 3pm. Erm...that's when check in is so really no reason to moan is there!  Anyway in conclusion my friend and I had a fantastic time and would not hesitate going back again which I'm sure we will be doing next year. The hard working staff are a credit to the hotel.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Cheshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UncletravellingMac
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,nichollc wrote a review Oct 2018,30,Its Not five star,I am going to give the most honest review i can.    Firstly we had a great holiday met some nice people and really enjoyed our stay.    I would guess the hotel had 100 rooms taken    The Good    The Grounds and gardens are amazing.    Our room a suite fantastic like a apartment really    Pools clean and good but cold on first entry    Beds are fantastic    Pool beds loads available    Breakfast was good i generally only had fruit and fried eggs toast or freshly made omelettes    Food was ok apart from the french patisserie desserts which were amazing also bread was really good. The meats was repeated the day after in some guise or other think the turkey made 4 appearances!!    Hafid at the lobby bar was fantastic really great service made cocktails that was not on the menu. Other staff was mix and match i really think its an general education thing.    Entertainment was decent  i do think the disco 'down with the kids' was a little aimed at a lot younger generation ie 20's thought and sounded like i was in the middle of Ibiza at some points    The Bad    No iron in room If its five star this should be standard however laundry is cheap and good service.    Just a point on the iron when we arrived we asked for an iron in our room which was delivered promptly. We came back to the room and both me and my wife fell asleep due to the early morning flight. Staff entered the room and took the iron while we was sleeping!!!! when we both awoke i when down to the desk and complained only to be told we should have put do not disturb sign on I am not the best when first woke i requested iron again and they never took it back.    Minibar in room should be full in five star all inclusive with beer and wine at least. We stockpiled San Miguel beer from pool bar and kept some in room.    No bar service around the pool area not major problem but again i would expect for five star.    A la carte restaurant was terrible. we had menu 2 we hardly ate anything we spoke to alot of people who felt the same    Ran out of wine on 3 nights both white and rose also pool bar not stocked for opening and then when was 1hr later everything was warm.    Reception staff it was a pain to organise anything even booking the bus could take 15 mins for what is a simple task. I asked them to book me a dinner reservation in marrakech's most famous hotel and he asked me for the number! which i did have because of my guide book. He then rang it and passed the phone to me to speak to them i said you speak french can you do it please. He looked at me perplexed.    Again all in all we had a good time one week is certainly enough    The hotel could be great just needs the finishing touches i do think you have to remember where in the world you are.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Yorkshire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nichollc
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Ricky M wrote a review Oct 2018,10,All show but zero substance. Appalling customer service!!!! Will Never stay again!!!!!,I never write reviews on anything however I feel strongly about how bad the service was at this hotel. Except for a few majority of the staff are very unwelcoming rude and make you feel like you are a bid inconveinece to them. We were ignored every morning at breakfast and couldnt even get a bottle of water or pot of coffee for our table despite asking at least 4 or 5 times. Lunch was the exact same things as well as dinner. Beware of the hidden charges at check in which go by tbe exchange rate on the day and not what you are quoted when you book also a ¬£100 deposit is asked which includes a towel deposit however you do get this back when you check out. The poor service is such as shame as this really has a lot of potential as a hotel. This is mainly due to the beautiful green gardens and idilic grounds with a lovely pool area and no shortage of sun beds. We loved the room which was very clean spacious and modern and had a great nights sleep. The food however was very basic and repetituve and by the end we were very fed up of the lack of choice. There was a lot of cold leftover food with flies swarming around very off putting. We asked for a plug adapter at the check in desk which they said was no problem(of course when they were taking or money however it never arrived and when we asked again we were bluntly told we dont have any!!! This was so we had to buy one from their shop next door. We asked for a iron 4 times and it never arrived and they again were very rude to us eventually it came but very late at night when we wanted to iron things to go out to dinner.We are really dissapointed in how we were made to feel at this hotel and will never come back to stay here or recomend it to our friends. It's definitely not 5* and the other guests we spoke to said the same things as us so we can't all be wrong!!!!,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rickym493
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Frosty32 wrote a review Oct 2018,40,This is NOT a 5 Star Hotel,Unfortunately this Hotel is 4 star at best.  First the good points.  The actual Hotel is quite nice kept very clean and most of the staff are friendly. Having 2 pools is a good idea 1 is noisy where all the entertainment happens like aqua aerobics dancing etc and the other has a swim up bar but is much quieter. There are plenty of sunbeds at both and there didn't seem to be much saving beds early in the morning which was nice for a change.  Second the points that make this not a 5 star.  When we arrived which was about midnight we were told our room wasn't ready not a good start but were told we would be moved in the morning. The room we were given was ok apart from the fact that you could see into the bathroom from the bedroom toilet and all. Then as other people have commented when we had our showers in the morning the water was everywhere and coming out of the bathroom into the bedroom. We hoped our new room was going to be better. It was better as the toilet was a room on it's own with a door. However the shower was slightly better as long as you only turned it on half way otherwise it flooded the bathroom again.  The food for a 5 star was not up to the standard of other 5 stars we have stayed in. There wasn't much choice and it was always luke warm. The dishes didn't vary much each day so we were glad that we were only staying for 1 week as you would get really fed up of the lack of choice.  The separate Moroccan restaurant was nice but they bring the courses too quickly after each other.    The drinks were of a poor standard apart from the beer which was fine. When staying at other 5 star hotels there is always Prosecco and Baileys (or Baileys substitute) not at this hotel.    This is probably the only hotel I have ever stayed in where you have bottle beer around the pool. Now whilst we were there I didn't see anyone drop a bottle but it is a disaster waiting to happen.    Lastly we enquired on our day of departure if there would be a courtesy room to use as we were not leaving until 8.00 pm. We were told by reception to come back and they would give us a courtesy room just to get showered and changed. Unfortunately when we went back the staff member had finished for the day and we were then told there was no room available. However we could use the SPA area which was ok but they don't have any hairdryers. I have never know a SPA NOT have hairdryers. Anyway once we got to the SPA we were told that they had not towels and we would have to go back to reception to get some. Starting to get a bit annoyed I went back to reception for towels who said they don't have towels. I can honestly say that the reception staff at this hotel are useless and fortunately the staff at the SPA sorted things out for us. Never once did we get an apology for not having our room ready and we had no apology for not getting the courtesy room that we were promised.    It is all the little things that make this Not a 5 star and I am surprised that Tui sell this hotel as a 5 star having stayed in some of their 4 plus hotels which are much better.    We will not be going back and I would not look at Be Live Collection if this is their standard.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"St. Asaph, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Frosty32

Not normally a fan of buffets but it had a wide range of tasty food and desserts were so gorgeous you had to have at least a few. The only disappointment was the A La Carte restaurant which has limited choice and quite frankly wasn‚Äôt particularly good so stick with the buffet. Two lovely pools one quiet and the other with music and daytime entertainment provided by a good fun loving team who weren‚Äôt over the top and didn‚Äôt hassle you to join in if you didn‚Äôt want to.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Faysiemaisie wrote a review Oct 2018,30,Rather disappointing I‚Äôm afraid ...,I was prepared to overlook the negative reviews and make up my own mind but I‚Äôm afraid I was bitterly disappointed. Overall the staff were polite helpful and eager to please apart from one waiter in the dining room who wouldn‚Äôt bring us a glass of wine because we weren‚Äôt at one of his tables !! The morning after our arrival my husband went for a shower and the water literally flooded the entire bedroom floor. The ENTIRE floor !!! The hotel has been open for over six months and this problem should have been fixed by now. The bedside lights in our room didn‚Äôt work and the main light switch crackled loudly when switched on or off. Even though it‚Äôs an adult only hotel it is definitely mostly geared towards young couples which disappointed me a little. We didn‚Äôt feel as though we could join in any activities with all the youngsters taking part... need to have something more for the oldies. Most of the food in the buffet restaurant was indeed cold. And even though I stuck to rice and vegetables (barely warm)  and my husband ate the fish but not the meat we both managed to have horrendous stomach upsets after only two or three days. This lasted for at least a week after our return home. While most of the hotel seemed to be clean there was a round dirty mark about four inches in diameter on our bathroom floor when we arrived and it was still there when we left. Can‚Äôt recommend I‚Äôm afraid.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Sixtoe wrote a review Oct 2018,50,A far better experience than I expected!,We arrived at the hotel (located on the very outskirts of marrakech in the middle of nowhere) and it looked lovely (be warned if you arrive before 3 your room will not be ready).  Whilst waiting for our room to be prepared we were sent to the main buffet restaurant which is fantastic (I‚Äôve read people complain the only time I felt I‚Äôll is when I ate far too much of the food!) a great selection of food which changes every day with great staff (and both the food and service is much better than the on site ‚Äúspecial‚Äù restaurant which I really wouldn‚Äôt bother with).  The first room we had smelled really awful and flooded after my first shower I think the drain had broken they tried fixing it once and when they couldn‚Äôt they moved us to another room which was lovely so not knocking a mark off for that as the entire place is *constantly* being cleaned.  The entire staff was very good and friendly particularly the younger ones. Titef Miso and especially Simo from the pool area were great Simo was constantly smiling and engaging with everyone trying to get them to join in with everything (and even taught me some Arabic!) and made the holiday much more fun than I expected and young youssini from the restaurant always had a smile and remembered what we had to drink each night.  The drinks were plentiful apart from the few nights we stayed up late where they actually seemed to run out of certain alcohol they could do with more than one person at each bar at busy times as well although you never had to wait for more than a couple of minutes.  The on site gym and sports facilities are all good and there‚Äôs also superb WiFi throughout the entire resort including all rooms and outside.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Rhian S wrote a review Oct 2018,20,Awful Experience due to stomach bug,Myself and my partner decided to come to be live Marrakech for a relaxing romantic holiday. After saving up quite a lot of money for us to come here  we were happy to find that upon entering the hotel staff were generally pleasant the hotel was spotless and despite a foul smell coming up from the shower and toilet most days in our room it was kept immaculate by the cleaners.    Upon first impressions despite the smell we were content...Then about halfway into day two I was hit with the worst tummy bug I‚Äôve had in a long time and going by the food in the buffet restaurant I am honestly not surprised. Some of the meat is pink and undercooked or if it‚Äôs not it‚Äôs dry and over cooked. There‚Äôs flies and wasps crawling all over the soft drink machines and on the buffet food and it‚Äôs just not up to scratch for a five star hotel. We are about to have our last day and evening at the resort tomorrow and I am still so ill and have been since Monday so haven‚Äôt been able to relax by the pool or have the holiday with my partner that we have been waiting for all year. I am so upset and disappointed and I would not recommend this hotel if you have a sensitive stomach.    It is such a shame because the hotel could be fantastic if they just work harder to make sure their guests don‚Äôt get ill with the food they prepare in this place.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,danieljowen wrote a review Oct 2018,20,Noisy. Terrible food.,"First the good points:    The buildings grounds and rooms are lovely. I found my room spacious attractive and comfortable. There were some quirks - the window between the bedroom and bathroom is just weird and the shower tray is almost flat so it didn't take much to flood the bathroom - but overall the room was a pleasant place to be particularly as it was air conditioned. It would have been nice to have a kettle and the ability to make a cup of coffee.    The all-inclusive package worked well. There were no hidden surprises or charges for things snuck in. The local beer was fine; the Moroccan wine actually very nice particularly the red.    Some staff - particularly in the restaurant and lobby bar and housekeeping staff - were very friendly welcoming and helpful.    Now the bad stuff:    First impressions are made at check-in and check-in here was officious and unwelcoming. No smile no friendliness no conversation just 'fill in this form'. It wasn't until dinner 5 hours later that someone (restaurant staff) actually said ""welcome"". You're given a wristband that you have to wear during your entire stay so you feel like an inmate in an institution. They also take a ¬£60 damage deposit plus ¬£20 for the pool towels (which are ordinary brown towels not worth stealing and not worth ¬£20). While these deposits were refunded to me at the end of my stay I will have paid two lots of foreign currency transaction fees for this pointless exercise.    I have never had worse food than here without being actually poisoned. I dreaded each meal. It was supposedly an 'international buffet' but it looked like some kind of 70s recipe book horror show. Much of the food was heavily processed and heated up from a tin or packet - and was vile. Sauces tasted mostly of raw flour if you were lucky - I tried the lasagne one evening and it tasted like it had been made with custard powder. Everything absolutely everything was massively overcooked. Meat was dry and leathery vegetables soft and tasteless. The Moroccan food was a particular disappointment; it should have been full of spice and fruit but instead was bland and flavourless - and massively overcooked like everything else. Breakfasts were no better. Limp pink strips of bacon - that had been nowhere near a grill or frying pan - sat and steamed on their hotplate next to (powdered) scrambled eggs that sat in a grey puddle. Shakshuka involved eggs that had been overcooked so they had turned to plastic in a sauce that lacked any flavour. It was all hideous. Nothing was labelled properly so you had no idea what anything was. A dish might be labelled ""beef"" but you had no idea what it was beyond that (other than it would be overcooked and have no flavour). A counter with six dishes on it might have three labels next to them but you didn't know which dishes the labels applied to so they all remained a mystery. I'm not a vegetarian but I noticed that there was little for vegetarians to eat other than salads or side dishes. Even these were problematic - a mixed salad of tomato cucumber and red onion for example turned out on closer inspection to have shrimp mixed in with it. Again lack of labelling doesn't help. On my last evening I considered just going hungry rather than having to face another disgusting meal.    You have little choice but to eat here three meals a day. The hotel is in the middle of nowhere on a piece of scrub land miles from anything. You can't just walk out to the local village and hope to find a decent meal there.    I had been hoping for a peaceful relaxing week but this place is anything but peaceful. Around the larger of the two pools they play (modern Western pop) music all day which they then crank up to obnoxious levels two or three times a day for 'pool aerobics'. All you could hear anywhere in the hotel grounds was the thudding of this music. While this clearly appealed to some people the majority huddled around the other smaller pool to avoid it - so this pool was often overcrowded (and this was not high season and the hotel was not full). At weekends the place fills out with a party crowd who drink a lot and make a lot of noise. Lots of people like this and if you're one of them you'll enjoy this place. But if you're looking for peace and quiet stay somewhere else.    Finally a note of caution for Brits or other English-speaking visitors: Morocco is a French-speaking country and this hotel is very much geared up for French travellers. You may find (as I did) that your booking has been made via a French tour operator meaning that the local rep speaks no English. The English language ability of hotel staff ranged from moderate to non-existent. You may find some difficulty communicating any slightly unusual request or getting a problem resolved. (I had a blocked shower drain and the first time I reported it the response was to send someone round with more toiletries!) If you go on an excursion you may find you are the only English speaker in the group and the guide's English may be limited. This isn't a complaint - just something to be aware of if your French isn't great and you're used to being able to be understood in English wherever you go.    Overall my sense of this hotel is that they want to give you the impression of abundance and luxury but actually no one really cares about any of it. What you get is quantity rather than quality. If you're a fan of noise and indigestion this would be an ideal hotel for you.",Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Barnstaple, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danieljowen

Reception staff are very unhelpful and make you feel like your wasting their time. The bars close at midnight and the only thing you can do then is return to your room. There is a sports bar which is only open from 10pm to 1am and the point of that is unknown. Not the most welcoming of bars one pool table and a tv and not particularly comfy. Terrible sewerage smell in the room most mornings talking to other holidaymakers they had the same problem. Went to use the toilets one evening to find that they were locked!!! The quality of the drinks both alcohol and soft was very poor and basically warm at all times  ice was put in but that didn‚Äôt help.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,JohnandTricia wrote a review Oct 2018,40,"Enjoyable week, nice hotel",Just had a week at this hotel and had an enjoyable and relaxing time. It is fairly new and so generally very fresh and kept extremely clean. We were in a double room facing out to front of the hotel so view not very interesting but that did not bother us these rooms get morning sun and garden facing rooms get it in evening. Room was a good size and well equipped very comfortable bed and good wifi reception nice bathroom effective and controllable AC.  Being adults only means the atmosphere is much quieter than similar resorts and you have the choice of a quiet pool and the one where the low key activities take place. Plenty sun beds at both. Swim up bar at quiet pool and snack bar at other pool.  Sports Bar was shut for works but between the main bar pool bar and other seating areas you can always find somewhere to sit comfortably. Entertainment every night of the usual variety some of it quite good.  Food in the buffet was of a good standard we could always find something to suit us. We did try the Moroccan restaurant and it was ok but not better than the main one.  Have seen some critical comments about staff but we found most of them friendly and helpful particularly if you engage be respectful and the odd tip always helps - the way some guests treat staff is horrible.  The shuttle bus to the city is valuable as there is nothing around the hotel itself.  Only criticisms would be that when groups arrive together as seems to be popular with those from southern Europe the buffet struggles to cope - not enough staff. Also we arrived at 3am (see below) and there was not even a cup of tea or coffee available - not a good welcome all it takes is a machine in a corner somewhere!  Beware regarding passport control at Menara we joined a massive queue at 23.45hrs and finally got through at 02.00hrs disgraceful way to treat arrivals.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Scotland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnandTricia
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,abbylaurencooper wrote a review Oct 2018,40,Lovely stay outside of Marrakech!,My boyfriend and I visited the Be Live Hotel at the end of September for a week and had a lovely time! After an evening flight we were both very tired and quick to get into the hotel room. The concierge and reception team were quick to check us in after checking in a pair of slightly unhappy couples that arrived before us. Reading reviews prior to our trip we were aware of the room/towel deposits before we arrived so planned in advance by taking out ¬£100 before leaving the UK and bringing our own towels - which was no problem to us!We loved how quiet and relaxed the hotel was with the option of spending time around the entertainment pool when we wanted to do AquaGym! The entertainment team are a credit to the hotel especially Simo - made our trip very fun! Around both pools there are ample sun loungers so there is no rush to reserve them in the morning which means you can totally relax and even get one of the comfy bed loungers in the afternoon!The decor of both the restaurant and buffet restaurant are lovely and Oussama gave us incredible service during our stay (should be definitely promoted!!) Yes sometimes you have to wait for a table to be cleared because the buffet is busy but this didn't bother either of us - we were looking for a relaxing holiday not to complain all the time!! Only advice or criticism I would give is that maybe the senior restaurant team members could put more of an effort in to help the tireless waiters who were rushing around so less complaints were made?!Although we didn't have a pool view our room was lovely with a nice shower and the most comfortable bed! The maids cleaned the room everyday to a high standard which was lovely to come back to after a day in the sun or the medinas.The shuttle bus into the medina is a nice idea Overall it was a really lovely trip and we thoroughly enjoyed our time at the hotel.,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Staffordshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abbylaurencooper
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Trish H wrote a review Oct 2018,30,Nice Hotel but has issues!,"So my experience at Be Live Collection...  I arrived in early hours of the morning it was a mini bus that took myself and a couple to the hotel.. on arrival we headed to reception I had to pay a deposit for the room and a deposit for a towel.. I was aware of this due to the reviews I had read. A member of staff took me to my room showed me around even opening the patio doors switched on the light and there was the pool. Although by this point I was shattered it did make me feel quite excited about this holiday.  Within my room there was a massive bed huge tv that played english movies the bathroom was beautiful had a bath separate walk in shower with a rain fall shower head plus a smaller one... I do recommend that when using the shower turn the head towards the wall a bit otherwise you will end up with a flood in your room!  The restaurant for breakfast had plenty of options... cooked...cold meats... cereal... fruit... pancakes you can sit inside or outside a waiter/waitress will offer you tea and coffee you sometimes have to remind them you need a teaspoon!  My first morning I went to the pool outside my room.. I presumed it would be the quiet pool as the towel hut was there also the swim up bar is at the other pool which usually means it is the louder pool... I was wrong this one was the lively one which wasn't a problem as a range of music is played from acoustic soft to dance music... there is a range of activities that happen around the pool.  It is also very quiet and plenty of sunbeds to choose from I am a creature of habit and like the same space every day... I found a nice little spot collected my towel from the animation team who were friendly...  The animation team come round to introduce themselves and let you know what is happening that day... this is where the trouble started... I am a solo traveller and quite confident travelling alone... sometimes as a solo traveller you get a bit of unwanted attention mainly because people from other countries don't really understand that you want to chill out...  The first guy introduced himself as Simeo he asked if I wanted to go out to town with him one evening being polite I said ""maybe"" his response was ""tell me now I am a busy man!"" then the implication came with women tend to sleep with him. After that I said no thanks... he was quite abrupt and it was made very clear he was off to try his luck with the next woman! Later on another animation team member came introduced himself as Titif came along for a chat he knew about me from Simeo I got the charm... your very beautiful I like you... blah blah I was just polite said my thank yous and went back to my kindle... I was pretty much offered sex by 2 reps... I got chatting to others round the pool and it turns out that they were receiving this unwanted chats as well! I didn't go on holiday to be hinted at how poor they are paid or that I need to sleep with a animation team! I am aware pay is low but if want a tip... don't be putting it my face!!!  There was one animation team Karim who I made friends with and would go for lunch with him... I didn't think he was like the others however I got the same stories however I made it clear friends only and wasn't interested in anything else I would say he was far more respectable than the others he got the hint from me that it was friends only and i wouldn't exchange numbers and I was happy to be friends in all honesty he prob was the nicest one out of the lot!  (ladies be aware they all have the same story!! oh they all like to tell you how well they are hung!!!)  In the evenings I didn't come away to be approached by Titif all the time being told he wanted to kiss me wanted to be with me...(he was spinning the exact same thing to ladies I had made friends with)  I feel very sorry for any of the ladies that fell for it and thought they were special as sadly they had us all lined up!  My biggest warning is to the ladies travelling together or solo just be very aware of the animation team they are very arrogant and mouthy.  Yes there is a language barrier and what we would find funny they don't get! But also they think they are irresistible and we won't be able to not sleep with them!!!  The waiters at the snack pool are ok one waiter decided to tell me I was fat and could wait for my food as I didn't look like i was hungry. When I asked him to explain he called me big! I lost my temper with him and he didn't understand what he had said was wrong!  Although there are sleazy staff at this hotel I actually had a great holiday made a lot of friends the weather was amazing I loved my room and food is samey but hey I didn't have to cook for a week...  Seating outside is limited so if you wanted to watch entertainment you needed to eat your dinner on a table by the stage or you are left in the lobby bar...  If you are a couple and want a chill out week yeah def have a fab time! I'd go back if I was with a guy but if your girls on a holiday together just be careful... But if your after a holiday romance then go fill your boots but just remember they have numerous women on the go at the same time.... at least you will get the same story from all of them!",Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Bournemouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrishH1975

The animation team are brilliant always friendly. Loved the daily aqua gym! We was always served at our seat never had to go to the bar for a drink and bought us wine to our table in a ice bucket which was a nice touch. Waiters and cleaners work so hard. Wifi was good although better in the main areas rather than the bedrooms. The shuttle bus is good however we got dropped of on a back road so be aware this is not where the souks club med is where the horse carriages are you have to walk through the garden past the mosque and cross the road and there is the main markets. We was on block 3000 with garden view the room was lovely very clean the only thing we can say was would of preferred our room cleaned in the morning rather than 4pm as we returned to our room sometimes but think there was only one cleaner on that block. Will definitely recommend to our friends and looking forward to coming back next year. Really can't understand why people complain about this hotel people say it's not 5* because there's no room service which i wouldn't want why would I want to be stuck eating in my room I'm on holiday and because you can't get wifi all the time why would I want to be on my phone 24/7 I go on holiday to get away from it.

One of my friends had been liaising with the hotel to arrange a taxi to take us from the airport to the hotel. She had sent our flight number and received email confirmation that a taxi had been booked. Upon leaving the airport there was no taxi to be found. We called the front desk to find out where to meet the taxi driver and they were extremely unhelpful and provided no solution to the issue. We ended up having to get a taxi from outside the airport and pay a higher price than agreed with the hotel. This was only the beginning of the awful service and terrible holiday.  We arrived before check in time and were told to make ourselves comfortable and go and get lunch. We looked around the hotel and the spa. We were interested in booking spa treatments and were told we could only pay for these in cash. We were encouraged to withdraw cash from the ATM in the hotel lobby.  Upon returning to the front desk to check in as stated in other reviews we were hit with tourist tax room deposits and towel deposits which we were not made aware of prior to booking. We tried to tell Mohamed that we wanted to pay for both rooms in one card transaction however he ignored this request and took the payments separately thus incurring two currency exchange charges.  Following checking in we tried to withdraw 1300 dirhams to pay for the spa treatments as advised however the ATM processed the transaction and failed to dispense any cash and printed out a blank receipt. Naturally we were very concerned about this as it isn't a common occurrence in the UK. We approached members of staff from the front desk who were extremely unhelpful Loubna even laughed at me while I cried over the lost money. We were eventually directed to Mounia Ouarhzif PR Manager who was insistent that the ATM machine was not the hotels responsibility and there was nothing she could do. I spent a long time trying to explain to her she does have some responsibility as the service is within her hotel. She then became adamant that we should wait 48 hours for the money to be returned to my account. I requested she put this in writing to guarantee liability for the lost money. All she could tell me was that her word was enough and we should take her word. I explained multiple times this was not enough for me and I needed further action to be taken. After wasting time calling multiple people and getting no response Mounia decided to send myself and my friend to a bank in the hotel taxi with a rep who was responsible for booking excursions and did not know a thing about the situation. When arriving at the bank the Rep did not know what to say and we were dismissed within a minute of entering the building and sent back to the hotel. Upon returning to the hotel Mounia was extremely unhelpful again and decided to send an email to a representative at the bank instead. Mounia asked what time our spa treatments were arranged for to which we replied 10 & 11 and she so kindly offered to allow us to pay for these treatments on card instead. She did not ever come close to offering us any compensation for the stress caused by this situation.  The email chain between myself Mounia and Houda went back and forth over the next day with no outcome. Over the next four days we received no update from Mounia or the bank and it was as if the whole problem was forgotten. We went to Mounia on Monday who informed me she would send another email however she did not bother to do this until I approached her again hours later. Whenever I went to reception to ask to speak to her I was informed she was not there or she was busy although I could see her sitting in her office picking out underneath her nails. We returned to the bank on the following Tuesday with Sarah PR due to the lack of update and spoke to Houda (Bank Populaire) who then told us it would take over a month to receive our money back. This naturally was very upsetting as we had already spent the majority of our holiday with no money and now knew we wouldn't have any money before we left.  My friend developed an allergic reaction during our stay and needed antihistamines and suffered irritation around her eyes and face. As we had no money we were unable to get to a pharmacy and purchase any medication. My friend was reviewed by the hotel nurse who offered to leave an eye wash at reception to help with the symptoms. When we collected the eye wash we googled the eye wash instructions as it was all in French and then realised the eye wash was three months out of date which is completely unacceptable for any star hotel let alone a 5 star.  We had two double rooms which both had continual issues with leaking showers which we reported however no one ever arrived to fix. The rooms were acceptable however the house keepers never replaced our water until the last night of our stay meaning we were always thirsty and having to go to the bar to get water which was an inconvenience.  We booked the a la carte restaurant for our last evening to round the holiday off nicely. Myself and my friend are both vegetarian and upon arriving in the restaurant we informed the waiter about this. We were told flatly there is no vegetarian option available and offered no alternative food. We were repeatedly told beef or fish and also were only offered beer or wine despite the bar being connected to the restaurant. My friend and I decided to speak to the front desk and public relations about the issue. Mohamed from the front desk informed us he did not know anything about the a la carte restaurant which is ridiculous. The lady from PR appeared to begin helping us only to put her palm up to my friend and say ""wait"" and chase after a couple of guests to talk to them for a while. Eventually she called the chef over and informed us we should have notified them of our dietary requirement to which we informed them it is completely unacceptable to not serve a vegetarian option at a five star hotel with regular visits from various nationalities. The chef informed us we could select items from the buffet to take into the a la carte restaurant and led us into the buffet (that we had eaten for the previous six days - morning noon and night - as we couldn't leave the hotel due to lack of money. We asked the chef which items were vegetarian and were told a rice dish contained no meat. We began putting this on our plate and then realised it actually had meat in. We then walked off in disgust (to the desserts which were the only nice option) and my friend began to slide across the floor due to an oil spillage which had not been dealt with. My friend nearly broke a bone from this and no apology was offered from the staff in the buffet.  The staff at the bar were extremely slow and there were only ever two people serving drinks which lead to large queues regularly. One of the bar staff Hafid actually called two other people forward instead of serving me and my friend when we had been waiting patiently for around 15 minutes. We can only assume this is because they were young and very pretty.  The buffet restaurant has very minimal labelling which lead to multiple near misses of meat consumption. The waiters were also very slow and one day we waited half an hour for a glass of Pepsi that we had to ask for four times that was flat on arrival. Often the tables were not cleared up from previous guests and there was regularly a lack of available tables at dinner. There were flies all over the food in the buffet.    Positives of the holiday would be the pool with the swim up bar Reda was friendly and helpful and the weather which is out of the hotels control.    I would not recommend this hotel to anyone please do not waste your money.",Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMH2103

We were very disappointed. When a member of staff reduces your wife to tears because he shouts at here because she didn't understand him speaking in French (she is English) it's not great.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Danny P wrote a review Oct 2018,20,"5 Star Hotel, Your having a Laugh!!!",Its a lovely hotel with so much potential but it needs someone to sort it out as it‚Äôs no where near 5*.    Some of the Bad -    1. Food - it‚Äôs the same food everyday for lunch and dinner. They don‚Äôt have enough staff especially in the morning and you have to wait while the chef that is responsible for poached eggs runs around refilling the water bread yoghurt and everything else that he is responsible for while the 2-3 management stand at the door watching.  2. Night time - There is not enough seating at night and usually there is only one/two bar men so getting a drink is slow. The hotel was not even that busy so can‚Äôt imagine when it‚Äôs like in August! You only have one bar to sit in at night so minimal choice and limited seats.  3. How can you have a sports bar that opens at 10pm but most sport starts at 7.30pm- 8pm start in the uk? The time we got in there sport was finished and everyone was ready for bed. It‚Äôs really dangerous in there too as all the floor boards are broken and uneven.  4. Ala Carte restaurant - we visited the restaurant at 7pm we left with many others from other tables at 8pm as there is minimal staff they are rude and don‚Äôt top your drinks up. There were two staff in the whole restaurant so they never stood a chance with a fully booked rooster. The lady next to us asked for the door to be open as it was so hot (air Con not working) and the waiter was so rude to her. Not sure if that‚Äôs because she was a female but caused 4 other tables to leave the restaurant In disgust.  5. Drinks/glasses - Every time I got a drink at the snack or pool bar the glasses are dirty.  6. Minimal Toilets - There is a swim up bar that gets really busy but no thought was obviously put into the planning when the hotel was built as there is no toilets nearby. You need to have a 5 min walk back to main reception or the other pool to use the toilet  7. Showers - First few days our shower was cold. Luckily a fellow guest told us that the hot was cold and cold was hot no idea why they have built it that way plus the showers leak and flood the bathroom as the flooring is not designed right  8. Flies!!! - The hotel is covered in them especially around the snack bar buffet restaurant and bars which also had lots of wasps!  9. WiFi or lack of it! - The Internet connection is poor it goes down all the time and is inconsistent all day.  10. Shower facilities - we were not getting picked up until 9pm so asked if there were any shower facilities to use to get ready for our flight back home. Was told would need to use the outside cold shower by the pool or pay to use the spa so I could use their showers in the indoor pool. Never had a 5* hotel not offer these facilities  11. THE WORSE THING (Not hotels fault) was the 2 hour queue getting in and out of the country through passport control. üò¢    The Good - Animation team- Especially Simo Karim Titif and Ibrahim. They work hard all day talking and helping guests whilst putting on a packed entertainment program    Got some lovely staff that work in this hotel but it needs better management in order for it to be anywhere near a 5* hotel. I would not recommend this as a hotel to go to for my friends or family,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O1840YVdannyp
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Melg2006 wrote a review Oct 2018,40,Overall a good holiday,Just recently back from 10 nights at this hotel. We read a lot of the reviews before going so we were aware of some of the potential issues. I have to say I agree with some of the previous reviewers on issues such as waiting times at lobby bar and pool bar occasionally. We also had a nasty smell in the room which after reporting was dealt with.  We had no issues with checking in or out and all the times we approached them the reception staff were friendly and helpful.    The hotel itself is lovely and the rooms are clean and spacious with massive bathrooms. There seemed to be someone cleaning everywhere we went in the hotel it was spotless!  The pools are good. We preferred the quieter pool with the swim up bar. There were plenty of sunbeds available throughout our stay no matter what time we decided to get some sun.  There seemed to be plenty activities on offer if you wanted to take part.    The restaurants are mostly good not the best we've had on an all inclusive holiday but could always find something to eat. The desserts were fantastic in the buffet restaurant. The drinks at the bars (when you can get served!) were ok but clearly watered down. Staff are hardworking but there aren't enough of them in the bars or restaurants. If this was resolved I'm sure the complaints about waiting times would be greatly reduced.    The hotel provides a free shuttle bus to the main centre of Marrakech which is a bonus and saves having to get a taxi.  We used the Spa whilst there and was impressed by the facilities and treatments available. Definitely recommend a Hammam as a lovely relaxing start to the holiday.    A couple of improvements could make this good hotel much better. Tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms. An early breakfast or at least a takeaway breakfast for those going on early trips/departures would be a good addition. The motion sensor lights in the evening walking back to the rooms didn't always work and flicked on and off which was a bit annoying.    Overall we enjoyed our stay here hopefully the hotel will continue to act on feedback and make improvements to make this a great hotel.,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Maidstone, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Melg2006

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Sonia892015 wrote a review Sep 2018,40,"Lovely Hotel, Not yet a 5 Star",We were here for 10 days Overall we were pleased with the hotel which was very clean and also the variety of food the hotel had to offer was delicious.    On arrival the check in staff were not very welcoming or helpful. In fact there was a guest throwing up and none of them took any notice of this poor man. It took a cleaner to alert the staff management for anything to be done even though the reception staff had clearly seen the guest. We arrived early but was told our room would be ready in an hour we came back after 2 hours and still had to wait a while longer however once we finally were able to check in our room was wonderful very spacious and had a lovely big bathroom.    I have to state again that the reception staff were pretty much useless during our stay. We twice rang from our hotel room to re-arrange bookings but was quite abruptly told to just go to the reception. What's the point of having a phone in the room if you can't sort things out without trekking into the reception every time? I also wanted to change up some Moroccan Dhirams to smaller denominations. However I was told that the hotel didn't have any Dhirams left which was a complete lie as straight after I someone requested to change up some Euros to local currency.    The hotel was away from the main city which was fine for us as as we just wanted to relax in the hotel. The hotel do offer a free shuttle bus which is useful as you don't have to pay for a taxi. However it states that you will be dropped by the main market but you are actually dropped around a 5min walk away.    The gym is small and if you are planning todo some weight lifting there is only one bench and the weights only go up to 25kg. They are missing some of the most essential equipment in there such as a cable machine.    The bar staff were very friendly and were great at mixing drinks the only downfall was they supplied cheap alcohol which was very watered down. The pool bar and snack bar was infested with wasps and put us off ordering drinks from there we felt sorry for the staff who had to wok there all day.    The animation staff were very friendly and provided good entertainment the archery and gym aerobics was a hit. The entertainment in the evening was good especially the live music.    We would especially like thank Ayoub and Hafid from the bar staff. Also we would like to thank Sarah from the PR team who helped us greatly during our stay.,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Kent, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sonia892015
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Sunaina N wrote a review Sep 2018,10,WARNING!!!MONEY STOLEN,For the past two years i have done a trip to Marrakech with my girl friends. I have always stayed 4* all inclusive so i didnt mind paying extra for a 5* all inclusive adult only hotel.  To be honest i expected more from a 5* hotel considering its only been opened 6 months. The only best thing about the hotel was the bed and the animation team. The food was ok repetitive and seafood galore...even the pizza was seafood or margarita. The food is very bland even at the pool snack bar. We ordered a chiken and a meat panini...the chicken was boiled and the red meat was pink...that put us off from eating there.  The bedroom was nice but had a drain stench  The drinks choice was great but the wait at the bar was too long 20min.  So we got there on the 20.9 a thursday on saturday night we were going out...we had too much change approx 75-85 durham approx¬£8.00 we didnt think twice and left it on the table amongst other clutter...the money was not visible...on sunday night wen we going out again i thought ill add loose change to tge rest...well we couldnt find the change...spoke to reception and they advised to speak to public relation in the morning...but they did say that housekeeping might have taken it assuming we had left them a tip...i imagined the same...but didnt expect them to take money as its not the norm. So monday i spoke to the public relation Sara on monday explained money had gone missing and i wasnt impressed...especially from a 5*hotel. She advised that she will investigate and will let me know. So i thought it could have been honest mistake when she comes back to me ill let it be. So monday evening we are getting ready and noticed that my foundation NARS-longwear which took me 8months to get hold of the shade had been tampered with...it was a full bottle and there was no foundation in der it had not leaked into my makeup bag...no reason it should have done and it had finger prints all over the foundation. At this point i realised it had been done maliciously...no attempt was made to clean the bottle. I was soo angry and upset...why would some one want to do that...i took the bottle to sara and asked her to explain how this could have been done...i was shaking with anger and naturally wanted an explanation of WHY? She just looked at me blank...i had to ask her couple of times...do u understand what i am saying and all she could say is i am sorry for inconvenience and i will look into the matter. Any body can see this is the repercussions of making a complaint re money being taken...she said to give her time to investigate...i asked to speak to the manager she went in to see him 15min later he was unavailable...clearly he didnt think it was important to speak me...this definitely ruined my holiday!! I thought give her time to investigate...tuesday went by...she hadn't got back to me re the missing money or the foundation as wednesday was my last day at the hotel i went to see her and asked why she hadn't made contact...her answer was that she didnt see me...considering i spend all day at the pool side and she knew my room number...but hey ho...the best is yet to come...so i asked what did she find out...she said she rang the head of housekeeping and they concluded it wasnt housekeeping...apparently they never touched the money...oh yeah i also forgot to mention i left a ¬£1 at the same place and that also went Missin on tuesday! This took her 2 days to find out and expected me to chase her.i said i wasnt happy with the answer and wanted to speak to the manager...well the manager was not in that day it was his day off and der was no cover...so she said you can speak to her manager!! So the manager never showed 3 hours later...but the manager will be available next day thursday wen i fly out...how convenient....at this point i was not going to listen to her excuses...she was abrupt wasnt interested...i felt as though i was off the street asking her for a favour. I did say i will be taking this complaint further and i will putting a negative review on trip advisor and guess what her response was...sorry for the inconvenience...    Sorry for the long rant but i am soo disappointed that i paid a lot of money to be treated like this as though i made it all up!!! It is definitely not 5* i have been to better 4*  I also forgot to mention that the hotel takes ¬£80 deposit for damages and pool towels...like... are they for real..,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunainan2017

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,mcstickle wrote a review Sep 2018,40,Great Holiday,After reading some reviews online we were slightly concerned that this was not going to be a great experience but we were very pleasantly surprised.    The hotel looks great it is very new but there are some minor niggles that I‚Äôm sure will be addressed the towel rails in the bathroom seem to come loose easily along with the towel hook and it‚Äôs very difficult to have a shower without getting the bathroom floor wet. But overall things look great the pool and gardens are beautiful and everything is clean and well maintained. In the rooms there are big TVs that show Hollywood movies in English 24 hours a day which is nice if you want something to watch or listen to. The beds are very large and very comfortable and the robes slippers and washing equipment are all nice touches. The cleaning team are very nice and tidy the rooms to a good standard. We chose a ‚Äòswim up room‚Äô which was lovely and fairly private for when you want to cool down away from the main pool but if I have one criticism it is that ‚Äòswim up‚Äô made us expect to be able to swim to the room from the main pool and this is not the case more of a small private pool.    The food in the buffet restaurant is plentiful and there is a wide range of cuisine. Not the most amazing food I ever tasted but very good for an all inclusive at this price point especially in a developing country! We found the service in the buffet restaurant to be fast and polite especially from Oussama he went out of his way to please every time and it was a real pleasure to meet him thanks Oussama! We booked a meal in the restaurant for our final evening which was a very impressive four course dinner with wine. We were also impressed with the service from Tarik.    The swim up pool bar is wonderful with efficient friendly service and a good range of drinks including cocktails beer wine spirits. The other pool looked great too but we used the pool with the bar every day. Around the pool are some four-poster loungers with covers ideal if you want to get out of the midday sun.    The evening entertainment is varied and enjoyable with some talented musicians. The main bar staff are very polite and attentive sometimes the service is a little slow here but the staff do offer table service where possible to speed things up. In busy periods we would order two drinks each to make bar visits less frequent and we never became frustrated with the service again just a small niggle.    There is a spa and a gym which we didn‚Äôt make use off but worth mentioning at no gym listed on TripAdvisor.    A few tips for future holiday makers: take a pen to the airport as you have to fill in a form both ways at Marrakech airport. Also on the homeward journey you need to visit the check in desk even if you only have hand luggage.    Overall a very good holiday none of these criticisms tarnished our experience we came back to the UK feeling very happy and relaxed but we wanted to mention them so that the creases can be ironed out and our next visit can be followed by a 5 star review.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Katja S wrote a review Sep 2018,20,Ok for the price but it's already falling apart,"The Good:    Overall we had an enjoyable stay. The hotel is stylish the gardens beautiful the beds comfortable the pools quiet and the food good. It's nice you get bottles of water for meals instead of them refilling your glass constantly. The wine they serve is good too. The meal in the Ksar restaurant was the best we had in months.  The beds are large and extremely comfortable  We got a discount because we booked before they even opened so I think we got a value for money but if you pay full price now ....    The Bad:    First of all I think people who a book a 5 star hotel in a developing country and expect it to be the same as a 5 star hotel in europe/US are insane. It's just not the same.  But as other people have said there's a lot of small things that add up  - Service in general is quite slow! It's ok in the buffet restaurant. You get your own food and we didn't mind waiting a few minutes for drinks. Similarly the pool bar was pretty good too. You'd just go up and order and your drink was ready soon after. But in the Snack and Lobby bar it would easily take 20 minutes to just get the menu and then at least another 30 min to get a drink and your food. We actually waited an hour after ordering for a fruit platter once. During busy times they are just understaffed but in general a good waiter could handle the amount of people. It just seems staff was not trained properly  - It gets crowded. During our first few days the hotel seemed quite busy and it was impossible get a lounge chair at the pool people were pushing around in the buffet service was slow ....  - Hotel seems unorganized sometimes. We were there 10 min before check in so she told us to wait in the lobby bar for 30 min until 15:20 which was fine  After that we went to to reception and checked in. They gave us a room and a guy carried our stuff there. He opens the door and the room is a mess.  So we go back to reception. They suggest we wait for another 30 min until after 16:00. We decline and ask them to just give us another room and she just looks at the computer for 5 min without saying anything and then agrees begrudgingly. No apology    The Ugly:    - Rooms look nice but are falling apart and staff is very unapologetic about issues. Several things malfunctioned in our room. On the first day we hang a towel from the towel rail and a few min later the rail just fell off.  The next day we couldn't get into our room. First someone came and reset the card reader. It worked for about 5 min. Then he came again this time changed the battery and that seemed to fix it. It about 2 hours to figure out tho and no apologies whatsoever. No ""sorry for the inconvenience"" or anything.  Then a few days later we came back to our room after lunch and the small mirror was lying on our bathroom sink. Obviously it fell off when housekeeping was cleaning it and they just left it there.  On some days we got an unpleasant smell from the drains. It was not too bad and not constant but we heard other people had it worse and had to change rooms  Since they take a deposit for the room we were quire worried they would charges us for this but thankfully they didn't.  - In general the hotel is falling apart/badly maintained. The floor in the sports bar is ridiculously uneven tiles in the pools are already chipped/falling off. And that's just after being a few months old.  Also they have these great coveredpillowed lounge chairs which would be great. But they never actually put the cover on them. And when they do they are quite dirty and with holes    Overall we had a good holiday but we would not return and not recommend you pay full price",Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katjasK4857HV
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,korynferdinand wrote a review Sep 2018,10,5*.. Nothing 5 star about it,Where to start?!  1. There is only 1 person at a bar at anyone time so you will be waiting in a que for a least 10 mins before getting your all inclusive drinks  2. Food is tasteless with minimal option. My friend was violently sick for the last day of our trip.  3. The staff have no customer service skills what so ever and make you feel like you are not a valued customer. If you ask for a drink at any meal they will tell you someone else will get it but the drink will never come. Better to get it yourself.  4. While the bartender was making my drink a fly went in it and died. She picked it out and handed me the drink.  5. The rooms smell like drains. The AC makes the stench unbearable.  6. There is a ¬£60 room deposit fee that they fail to mention so make sure you bring enough money for that. There is also a deposit payable for pool towels.  7. The cleaners do not actually do as thier job title suggests but rather just tidy the room.  8. The manager is just as rude as the staff so to complain is pointless.  9. Black women are not welcome at this hotel you will be stared at no matter what you do.  10. The beds are the only 5 star thing about the complex.    To summarise. I do not know who gave this hotel 5 stars but they should take them back. The service is outrageous.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Francesca wrote a review Sep 2018,10,I‚Äôm sorry - did someone say 5 stars?...,I don‚Äôt know about anybody else but when I book a 5* hotel I expect to have a 5* experience. Not only do I expect the decor to be up to date and everything to be clean but I also expect the staff to be polished professional and helpful. I expect the food and beverages to be delicious and well prepared my requests to be granted reasonably quickly and when I pick up the phone to ask for something such as room service or extra pillows - I expect them to call me by my name. Is this too much to ask?... Well the Be Live Collection Adults Only Hotel certainly think so!!    On arrival I got a very warm welcome from Rashid the concierge. It‚Äôs a shame that his professionalism and integrity is overshadowed by the disservice of this hotel because he really did go above and beyond to make you feel special. Check in didn‚Äôt go as smoothly as it could have. When paying for our room I was faced with hidden fees such as a fee to rent towels for the sunbeds (even though I had my own beach towel) Tourist Tax and an incidental deposit. I was told I had to make three different transactions on my card rather than one transaction which incurred three foreign usage charges from my bank.    I was all inclusive but I wish I hadn‚Äôt bothered as the AI drinks menu was quite limited and the cocktails were undrinkable. Even a simple vodka and lemonade was approaching impotable! The food was very bland which was extremely disappointing as I love Moroccan food and the menu was repetitive (to be expected if staying for a week or two weeks but not for a four day stay like mine).    I was with four other young ladies and we were all ostracised. We were not greeted when we entered the restaurant like the French were and we noticed that whilst everyone else (French couples) were given a bottle of water on their table we were not. When we asked for a bottle of water anyone would have thought we had asked them to canoe all the way to Fiji climb the volcanic mountains and collect the tropical rainfall in a rain gauge!! We had to ask for a drink numerous times before receiving one and by the time we received any drink on our table I had nearly finished my plate of food. Not wanting to wait another 25 mins for another drink we would order another round of drinks (coke and sparkling water - not alcohol) but were told we had to finish our current drinks on the table first. At one point we had no cutlery on our table and I was made to wait 20 mins before they were brought. On our third day we had reached the end of our tether and demanded to speak to a manager expressing how very unhappy we were with the service and wanted to make a formal complaint. We were told the manager was not in and that there was no duty manager on the premises. The next day which was our last day was the only day we were even acknowledged. Greeted as I entered the restaurant asked if there was anything I needed my drinks brought promptly but it was a little too late to be honest.    My room was quite decent - I had the superior deluxe double room. However the telephone could not ring out which meant that I had to text my friends to call reception and ask them to ring my room. I never met the housekeeping team however I loved how they folded our bed linen and bedsheets into different patterns. Also the night staff on reception were very helpful especially when I needed someone to attend my room to save me from a spider.    This was my first ever visit to Marrakech and I would definitely return however I would NEVER STAY IN THIS HOTEL AGAIN! After returning to the UK I had a look at the reviews and can see that we were not the only people who experienced such rudeness from staff. I find it concerning that the hotel has reassured a customer who left a bad review in June 2018 that the hotel has now made an improvement and that ‚Äúthey care passionately about their guests feedback and remarks in order to improve the quality of their service‚Äù. This is not the case so don‚Äôt fall for it! It is simply the bog standard message they post to give the illusive impression that they are working to improve. It shouldn‚Äôt take more than three months to improve staff attitude and customer service. If you want to pay 5* prices and receive 2* service - then this is definitely the hotel for you!,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dellecate
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,CheGordon wrote a review Sep 2018,10,A major gamble of a hotel,The service here is poor and disrespectful and i dont know where to start. In the restaurant if you want any form of drink with your food i suggest ordering it 15mins before your meal or you might have to ask 3/4 times and then get attitude in return because youve had to repeatedly remind them. Most staff are rude and can be unjustly argumentative making you feel like you are an inconvenience. Every time I requested something it felt like it was a problem and thats if i was acknowledged. The cocktails are lucky to be called cocktails so don't have any expectations you will be disappointed. The food...ive been ill for 2 days now and friends were ill too. Because i was still ill i paid for late checkout only for someone to come knocking on the door asking when am i leaving and not believing i had late checkout. Instead of going to reception to check their mistake it was a confrontation. Every day my room was tidied but not cleaned but by this point i didn't even want to mention it.  This establishment has an extremely long road ahead of them for someone to understand why it's a 5 star. It is unfair to other hotels who work hard for that 5 star status to be put in the same bracket as this hotel. I would definitely visit morrocco again but will book with a more well known chain of 5 star hotels so that I can at least feel wanted at the hotel I have paid for. Unfortunately the VERY FEW staff who were polite are completely overshadowed by the disappointment of everything else. There are so many poor examples I could give but I would be writing forever. I feel they pick and choose who to treat well and make it obvious and if you stay here the majority of you will experience the same thing so book here if you want to truly gamble with your holiday.  I dont like to be negative but in this circumstance it's just completely unavoidable and true.,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CheGordon
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Sarah D wrote a review Sep 2018,50,AMAZING!,Me and my partner had booked here for our first holiday together. After hearing a few mixed reviews about morocco we were a little bit apprehensive of what to expect.    I can honestly say this place is unreal. The hotel the people the city the culture..    Firstly the hotel is absolutely immaculate. There are members of staff all over the building continously working hard to make the place look good. Whether its somebody buffing the marble floor Trimming the bushes washing the windows or watering the grass. I have never seen anything like it.    Our bedroom was beautiful. We had booked a superior room. The beds were huge and super comfy. We had the option of a bath as well as a shower room. The housekeeping team were superb and kept the room spotless. We were very impressed.    The grounds are beautiful and very well looked after. In the evening the place is lit up with lots of colourful lights. Great for photos!  There is a smaller quieter pool with a pool bar and a larger pool where they do activities during the day. Always sun beds free at both without having to reserve early on.    The hotel is located around 15 minutes from the city and there is a shuttle bus that runs from the hotel which is very sufficent. We took a trip to the markets and I would highly reccomend this. It was a real eye opener for us. Although we had people coming up to us every 2 seconds trying to sell something it was all part of the experience. My partner felt a little on edge but this was because he was more worried on my behalf being a white british female but honestly there is absolutely nothing to worry about.The men may stare a little but it's expected.  Everyone we had contact with was super friendly and can say they are the nicest people we have encountered with in a foreign country. Every single person welcomed us. I was a little apprehensive of what I could wear but most tourists wear what they usually would on holiday as did I and I was absolutely fine wherever I went so please don't worry about that!    There are plenty of trips and excursions to go on which you can book with the hotel. I would highly recommend the Ouzoud Waterfall- the most breathtaking views and place. Also the quad biking if you're a little bit of a thrill seeker!    The all inclusive buffet was great! Lots of different foods to try from. Some days were a bit samey but this is what you expect from an all inclusive. The cocktails are lovely. Plenty to choose from.  We ate out one evening at the Buddha Bar in the city beautiful restaurant!!!!    What really made our trip was 2 particular members of staff. Ayoub( lobby bar) and Ayoub ( snack bar). These 2 gentleman looked after us from the moment we arrived. These people are what make the hotel and they are an absolute credit to the place. We have made friends for life and I cannot wait to come back and see them. Both have a heart of gold. Great banter too! There was also another young gentleman whos name I cannot remember but also looked after us very well ( his parents lived in Manchester uk).    Also take my hat off to Simo this man was part of the animation team and would be in high spirits from 9am right up until midnight. His energy and happiness was so infectious. I don't know how he does it but what a star!    Like I said previously everyone we came in contact with was extremely kind and it's quite overwhelming really. What a beautiful country!  Please everyone ignore the bad reviews.    Thank you kindly to all members of staff it was an amazing trip.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Tom F wrote a review Sep 2018,10,Not Impressed,We are currently staying at the resort (19th Sept) and are disappointed overall.    The service in general is not up to scratch very long wait‚Äôs to get your drinks table service is even worse with most orders being forgotten about.    For so called 5 star there is a lot of things missing no tea or coffee making facilities in the rooms no room service and a warm empty mini bar fridge. The rooms are clean but lack amenities.    Upon check in they make you pay the local taxes followed by a large deposit. Not sure why they need the deposit as there is no mini bar or room service!    Went to the spa to look at what was on offer. Walked out after seeing them trying to charge 5 star prices. After the rest of the service we had encountered so far we thought it would be best to go back to our room and burn our money then give it to them.    The food is not 5 star standard and again the service just makes you not want to not bother going for food. It is very poor. You are better going to the local supermarket and making your own food. To be fair though the desserts are nice.    If you try and ring reception or need to speak to someone anywhere prepare for a long wait. It seems this is the case for everything we are British and used to queuing and waiting but this place is on another level.    Also on another note. Not that I like playing this card but feel I need to mention for other same sex couples wanting to stay here. We were defiantly made to feel different and very uncomfortable. I hate saying this type of thing but it needs to be said. We felt more comfortable and at ease in Dubai and Egypt. Looking at the service compared to other couples we got sub standard service.    Overall I would say this hotel is 3 star not 5. If they invested in staff training and better amenities it would defiantly be 5 star but at present it has a lot to learn. We have stayed in a number of 5 star hotels and this is by far the worst.,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tkford
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Rebecca N wrote a review Sep 2018,50,Honeymoon Heaven,We stayed for 10 nights in a swim up room for our Honeymoon in July.  Check in - swift quick and friendly. Helpful staff. We booked through On the Beach and had the rep greet us.  Room - we had a complimentary honeymoon cake and the room was decorated beautifully a lovely touch. The room was decorated with rose petals most days.  Pools - both pools are great you have the relaxed one for some quiet time the bar does get busy as its swim up but the staff work their hardest all day - getting one day off so please be respectful! The other pool has activities happening all day -the reps are fantastic so much fun and energy!!  Snack bar - the food from here is soooooooo nice be sure to have lunch here a couple of times! A suggestion - this should turn into a cocktail bar in the evening and cut queue time at the lobby bar.  Buffet restaurant and Moroccan - Such a wide range of food to eat at the buffet for all breakfast lunch and dinner - we didn't get bored of eating there at all. The food is at a high standard. The Moroccan restaurant has a choice of 2 set menus. We did book this for one night but it was closed (no one let us know) it wasn't an issue though as we were happy to re book and get at the buffet restaurant  Entertainment - WOW WOW WOW what amazing nights!!!!! from the belly dancers to the African performance - outstanding. The band were out of the world and the DJ could get work in top England clubs he is THAT good!!    Overall hotel smells lovely and is very very clean. The staff work extremely hard to please you.  The photographer Raid what a great guy - really happy and chatty always saying hi and offering recommendations for if venturing out.    Book a guided tour around the Marina with the on the beach rep at the hotel entrance - he's there from 3-6 the tour was excellent.

We stayed in one of the pool rooms which was a big wow absolutely loved it was lovely and modern the rooms were cleaned every day fresh towels gowns etc provided every day would highly recommend one of these rooms for the finishing touch.  The hotel itself was beautiful and spotlessly clean the staff are cleaning all day the reception staff couldn‚Äôt do enough to help with anything you needed.  Breakfast was delicious the food in all areas of the hotel was lovely all freshly made and with every choice you could think of and the Asian restaurant was lovely again can‚Äôt fault anything about the food and service. Drinks provided were excellent a brilliant choice of cocktails and lovely wine also lovely mocktails too.  The pools were excellent one near the sports bar had music all day and the animation team were so friendly fab aqua aerobics and games in the pool the other pool was a quiet pool but great if you just wanted to relax in peace this had the swim up bar which was lush.  The entertainment in the evening was brilliant overall me and my partner had an amazing week the weather was very hot but not once did we get bored and we both highly recommend this hotel for a chilled week away the hotel offer many excursions out of the hotel which were reasonably priced there is plenty to do if your not a sun worshipper too.

A new beautiful hotel with a warm welcome for all.  The adults only formula is fantastic and relaxing.  The facilities bars  restaurants and entertainment are of a very high standard and the staff greet you with a welcoming smile.  I would like to give a special mention to Ossama in the restaurant - excellent at his job -  Another extremely big mention to the entertainment team especially Karim Simo and Titif the life guard who SHOULD be part of the entertainment team .  As a new hotel there are a few little teething problems but nothing that we‚Äôre not dealt with efficiently.

The entertainment at the hotel was amazing and the fitness staff really made an effort to get you involved .

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,oxbury78 wrote a review Sep 2018,30,Lots of issues not 5 Star,When we arrived at the hotel we had a long wait with check in to when we finally got seen was told we could not check into our room for another 4 hrs But they would try their best to get us in as soon as they could 3 hrs later. Once we got into our room it was very clean and spacious We had a swim up room with sun loungers outside which was great Only problem with the room was it the drainage in the shower It flooded our room when the shower was on. The hotel drainage is poor And i heard alot of other people complain about this. There are some improvements that's desperately need sorting at the hotel.  - The bad smell of sewage drainage around the pool  - Wash the glasses at the swim up pool bar rather than just rinse them under a tap was remainders of last drink inside glass  - Excessive amount of flies around pool bars  - More staff needed at the buffet very understaffed  Apart from the above the hotel is clean pretty relaxing spacious and a good selection of food for buffet style and a good selection of drinks And free wifi around the hotel complex.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Nikki D wrote a review Sep 2018,20,Not a 5 star hotel,The only good thing about this hotel is the staff and sunshine. The staff are amazing. We checked in at 2 am. Our room had a disabled wet room. There is a huge window into the bedroom and no door on the toilet which Is not ideal if your a new couple or friends away. I had a shower in the morning which resulted in the bathroom flooding and the water going under the door and into the bedroom! We had to change rooms . Everyone we spoke to had upset tummy‚Äôs so I advise you take plenty of Imodium and buscopan. The only way I managed to settle my stomach was to avoid ice in my drinks and not eat lettuce. My husband and several others we spoke to had sickness and diarrhoea. Resulting in them loosing a day or 2 of their holiday. There is clearly something wrong with hygiene or food here to cause this to so many people. The staff are over worked and can‚Äôt cope with the amount of guest's. Some nights people were queuing out the door at the bar so I suggest u get 2 drinks at a time. They do do table service outside but it can take ages to get your drink and most times a drink would be forgotten. All they need to do is provide the staff with a note pad! Keep your phone well away from room key.. most days ours deactivated. Be careful what time u book your flights. We were flying at 11.30 pm and were they don‚Äôt provide a courtesy room for u to shower in! But u could use the shower around the pool!! This is the service of 5 star hotel ???!!!on the morning we checked out they said to come back at 12 to see if there was a room we could use. This is how they operate their courtesy room .... but we were told the hotel was full so there was nothing they could do !! After asking to speak to the manager they found a room we could use! Another we a disabled wet room which flooded again!! This hotel has so much potential but it‚Äôs definitely not a 5 star! The activities and entertainment is good but I do not appreciate being hassled by a male member of the animation team to leave a trip advisor review and give him 5 stars!!,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nikkid41
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,kaylgriff2018 wrote a review Sep 2018,40,4* as a few teething problems,From booking to arriving at the hotel we had a lovely experience. We had drinks brought to us on check in a lovely touch and the hotel checked us into our room early which was much appreciated.  The hotel itself is beautiful a real peice of paradise but unfortunately not without a few teething problems (hotel is new). We had a swim up room which smelt disgusting it was soon clear the drainage was the cause of the smell our room flooded when the shower was on and the smell got worse. We moved rooms and the smell remained we figured this was a problem we'd have to deal with and didn't want to move again.  The design of the hotel and drainage is poor when it rained the corridors flooded and became lethal to walk on.  Aside from the drainage issues the hotel is beautiful.  A major improvement that's desperately needed is staffing at the bar areas. You will wait half an hour at least for your drink to arrive on table service. If you go to the bar you have to queue not what you want to be doing on holiday. More staff would sort this issue immediately.  Apart from the above the hotel is clean pretty relaxing spacious and the food is delicious. The staff are helpful but slow.  Management seem to be around alot the last few days so hopefully these problems will be addressed. If they are addressed then this hotel will really be something!

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,kateO6452TF wrote a review Sep 2018,30,Some areas for improvement,We had an nice relaxing break at this hotel. There were aspects of our stay that we found disappointing but there were also many positives so we have endeavoured to give a fair and balance review.    We opted for a swim up room which we were very pleased with. We liked the outdoor seating area which had two sun loungers resting on a platform in the water. The room was spacious and airy and the bed was very comfortable. The rooms were cleaned daily to a very high standard. We did notice that the shower leaked quite significantly on to the bathroom floor but this was solved by adjusting the shower head so it pointed more in the direction of the shower wall.    The grounds of the hotel are beautiful and well maintained. We found all of the staff to be very pleasant and helpful throughout the hotel.    The main problem that we and many other guests experienced was that there were not enough staff in many of the areas in the hotel. In the buffet restaurant there were two mornings where we had breakfast without being offered tea or coffee and we had dinner once without being offered a drink either which was disappointing. There was also a time at lunchtime in the pool snack bar where we felt like we were being ignored as the one member of staff they had waiting tables was so busy serving other guests which was an impossible job for just one person during a busy service. At the lobby bar it took so long for our drinks to be served that we had to go and get them ourselves. These kind of issues are just not acceptable in what is supposedly a five star resort.    We dined in the a la carte restaurant once in our stay and we loved it by far the best meal we ate during our stay. (you can make a reservation in this restaurant once during your stay). The staff were very helpful and attentive and the food was delicious. You have an option of two set menus but they were flexible about substituting items from one menu with another which was good.    In terms of the buffet restaurant we enjoyed the Moroccan section. We did however find the choice of food on offer for each meal very repetitive and by the end of the stay we were quite bored of it all. We would also recommend that the hotel label all of the food as it really wasn‚Äôt clear what a lot of items were.    In terms of the entertainment we felt that this could do with some improvement. The singers were good but they did seem to sing the same songs each night. We would have liked to have had a bit more variety.    In summary this is a nice hotel but the issues I mentioned above really need to be resolved. We have stayed in many similarly priced all inclusive resorts and haven‚Äôt experienced any of these sorts of problems before it‚Äôs a real shame as these issues really let the hotel down.,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kateO6452TF
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Dziree wrote a review Sep 2018,50,5 star experience,I arrived at the hotel with zero expectations after booking a holiday for a 40th birthday celebration. The main selling point for me was that it was adult only and after 6 weeks of my kids i needed a break without having to deal with other people's whilst on holiday.    From the moment we stepped into the hotel the service was amazing and consistent till we left. The staff were attentive polite courteous and the service provided with what i can only describe as genuine passion. We arrived earlier than the 3pm check in time and although our rooms weren't ready we were allowed to start enjoying the facilities. Naturally we started at the bar where we met Yassine who makes the most amazing cocktails and these were unlimited. Not as strong as what i'm used to but fantastic all the same.    Lunchtime and dinner time staff deserve some accolade ... Hamza Oussama Mohammed Amin and the Adil the manager. These guys gave 5*plus service. The entertainment guys also Karim and Simo kept things exciting from disco night to aqua zuma to Karaoke night... there was no dull moment at Be Live. Plus i got a cake and had the whole restaurant staff sing me a happy birthday song. Perfect ending to our holiday.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Rue H wrote a review Sep 2018,30,Disappointing holiday,The process of booking was very good However I did have a few issues logging into my flight info and to check in and was annoyed about having to pay extra for seats when I believed I had already paid a significant amount as part of the complete package so that was disappointing.  In respect of the pick up the driver was polite and friendly however we did almost end up in an accident while being taken to our hotel!  The hotel itself was lovely. Great food and cocktails and the facilities were great. The room choice was exceptional and the cleaning service was top notch can‚Äôt fault it in any way.  However I do recommend that visitors make full use of the safe! We had an unexpected visitor late one night when it was believed we were at dinner. The gentleman attempted to enter our room and when he realized we were inside as we had not answered the knock he ran off mumbling about towels. We reported this to the reception who to us to the PR person who in my opinion was absolutely useless! She tried to make up excuses and then said we must use our date and said she would check it out and come back to us which she never did! I find that disgusting and unprofessional. My daughter and I were there as two females alone and it left us feeling very unsafe upset and shaken! This was two days before we left so it tainted our experience and we were pleased to be heading home at that point. There is not enough staff so if you go down to dinner late as it‚Äôs open from 6 to 10 and we ate at around 8.30 a few times expect to not have clean tables particularly on a Sunday or Monday and we ended up having to clean off tables ourselves to sit and eat at!  Finally the cocktail bar is always packed and you have to wait for a significant amount of time to get a drink as there is normally only one person working. Overall I am disappointed in this holiday as it was expensive and I don‚Äôt feel the service we received matched the star rating of this hotel considering we have stated in 5 and 4 start rated hotels before in the Caribbean and had far better quality of service and felt safe.,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Essex, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rueh2015

This really lets the hotel down!    At first we thought the food was lovely but wasn‚Äôt long until we were being sick along with most other guests that we spoke to! The staff were aware of this and some even said it was because of the sun!  We had to spend a couple of days of our holiday in the room due to being so ill again this was the same for lots of other guests!    Some of the bar staff are friendly but others were very rude and service was very slow a few days in to our holiday.    The room was kept very clean by the house keeping staff they were probably the friendliest staff in the hotel maybe they could teach the reception staff some basic manners!

The hotel is quite a distance from the centre of Marrakech in a rural setting. Check in was quick once we'd found the correct hotel (the taxi took us to another be live hotel nearby!). I gather that the hotel only opened this year and initially had some issues but these seem to have been solved now.    The room was large clean and well decorated with a comfortable bed good shower etc. WiFi not the best but did work. For an all inclusive hotel the food was generally very good quality with plenty of choice (meat fish salad Moroccan International etc) although the same choice most days.    Two good outdoor pools (one for proper swimming one with non-operational pool bar) plus an indoor (for an extra fee as its part of the spa). Annoyingly for an all inclusive hotel there was an extra deposit for the pool towels although luckily this could be done on a credit card. Watched the world cup in the sports bar on the first night and the bar ran out of alcohol by half time meaning a walk to the main bar and back but other than this no issues (local brands as usual for all-inclusive).

As stated by previous guests the hotel is spotless and well run. But the gem of this hotel is definitely the hard working staff. They are constantly working to cater to the constant demands of guests..  From the reception special mention to Ayoub and Mounia the lobby bar Yassin  the dining area Laila and Abdessamad and to my favourite animation team ever. These guys are a credit to Be Live and I hope they are recognised for their services. Special mention to Karimwho taught me archery Titif Simo and Ibrahim.

Very nice clean hotel with lovely gardens. Cleaning and maintenance staff obviously work very hard to maintain such high standards. Room was spacious and comfortable. Would have liked to have had tea/ coffee making facilities in our room but Maybe that's just me. Breakfast buffer opens at 7.00am anyway. Shower was a bit of an issue as water tended to spill out onto main floor area of bathroom so had to put towels down. Rooms cleaned every day and clean towels bathrobes and slippers provided. Pools nice. Lively one at one side with snack bar and various activities and quiet one at the other side with swim up bar.  Nice range of cocktails and outdoor entertainment every evening although this was a bit repetitive at times. Food was ok but nothing to tell you what it was so tended to play safe and stick to pasta and pizza more. Snack bar food nice and simple and morroccon restruaunt worth booking.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,travellingcockney wrote a review Sep 2018,40,Lovely new hotel,Sat enjoying my last day in the sun and thought to write a review for our stay. I think one of the first things worth pointing out is that the hotel is practically brand new so there is still going to be a few teething issues. Having said that on a whole I‚Äôve had a lovely time the staff can be a little mixed drinks service could be slow but you could see every member of the bar team working their socks off to accommodate quite a fussy bunch (my partner and I made a few friends and all enjoyed a drink a touch stronger than they were used to making) but a couple of the waiters in the snack bar could be a touch aloof at times. All of the staff were always working extremely hard but as it got busier it was clear that there needed to be more of them.    The food was pretty good I think with all all inclusive hotels you need to learn to choose well and be a bit picky heard and seen a few complaints that food wasn‚Äôt hot enough but in fairness I‚Äôve never been to an all inclusive hotel where the food is absolutely piping but there is a couple of stations on the buffet where pasta dishes and meat and fish are being cooked to order at lunch and dinner. The snack bar food is pretty good for burgers/panninis/ pizzas etc but service can be slow. The desserts are a highlight every evening there was an amazing selection.    The evening entertainment was a little lacking but during the day the entertainment team worked their socks off to help people have a little more fun laughing and joking with guests and encouraging them to get involved with games and activities even offering to help run drinks over from the bar if you had a few for the group. Karim Simo and Titif you guys were great thank you so much.    All in all we had a great time the hotel is beautiful and absolutely spotless and you can see all of the staff work incredibly hard but with all new openings there‚Äôs going to be teething issues.,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travellingcockney

The staff are always cleaning! The barmen try there best but honestly dont think they have enough staff as it can be slow at times but if you get multiple drinks its less trips to the bar !!

Having not stayed in a all inclusive hotel before I was unsure what to expect. Myself and my partner had joked that it would be like a upmarket version of the Tv show Benidorm.... Safe to say we were not disappointed.    Food:    After reading positive reviews on the food. When arriving I was pleased to see there was a fairly wide choice of food however it was all clearly frozen bland and tasteless. For the cost it was pretty poor. In addition to that my partner spent the majority of our stay on the toilet.    Entertainment:    The entertainment was not something we had necessarily thought about when booking however on arrival we watched  in pool dancing and Evening ‚Äúwhite party‚Äù disco . It was unentertaining and felt like something from the TV series Benidorm.    Service:    Bar service was not to bad  staff quite friendly happy to help. Restaurant staff also fine. Reception disorganised and really unhelpful.    Room:    The room is nice however it could be anywhere has about as much charm as a damp rag. Clearly poorly designed as when my partner had a shower the bathroom and then the room instantly flooded. The water was flowing out at such a rate there was waves being created. When we reported it the response was poor. After calling three times eventually a cleaner was sent. He was overwhelmed by the biblical flood that  the shower had created. Sadly the flood also soaked a lot of our clothes and equipment !    The room was soaked and the stone floors presented a dangerous slip hazard. Despite this we were told we would have to stay in that room  and they might be able to do something in the morning.    In conclusion it is a bit of a farce to call this  hotel as five star. Zero character school dinner food and terrible service.Five star price 2 star quality!,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hertzv

Am not one who normally put reviews on here as i always try to be positive about everything  But sorry i would say this hotel doesn't really have any entertainment as such .  It was my 4 th visit to morroco so i knew what to expect but 2 guys every night singing the same songs does wear you down .  We did have the odd shows ie brazilafrica etc but again same 3 girls dancing to more or less the same act says it all when you see mist folk playing cards !!  The hotel it self is lovely very very clean and very helpful staff but you do get bored at night.  Food wise mmm again ive been quite a few different countrys and i would say 75% off the food is catering towards Moroccans and hardly any of the food is labeled.  As i said lovely hotel but plz sort out labels on food ( very easy to do)  And invest in decent acts at night not 2 guys and then a dj who plays the french version of the birdy song all night,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewdY1483TM

When I was out the taxi driver said that‚Äôs too much and I should only be paying 100. When I got back to the hotel I told the gentlemen at the front desk and he was extremely rude.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Mrshiggs wrote a review Sep 2018,30,Good value for money,We booked this resort taking a bit of a gamble as it hadn‚Äôt opened so there were no reviews. As we were travelling in August we‚Äôd hoped any teething problems would be resolved.  We were on honeymoon and the staff set up the room nicely for us we upon arrival having notified them of this. We had a swim up room although it must be noted it can‚Äôt be swam up it is a small channel outside a few rooms bit colder than other pools but very nice to have.  The food is good and there‚Äôs always a wide selection to choose from except breakfast is a bit stark in comparison. What I really missed was a kettle in the room as you could only get a cup of tea at the restaurant & bars often in a cardboard cup! The a la carte restaurant was a bit of a let down as you just get a choice of 2 set menus which is not a la carte.  We booked through on the beach and paid less than ¬£100 pp pn so I think it was good value as some all inclusives don‚Äôt have as much included. Room was bright well air conditioned and cleaned nicely everyday.  I‚Äôm not sure why but the staff at the snack bar just aren‚Äôt as good as the ones at the restaurant & pool bar and are a bit ignorant/rude.  Considering it‚Äôs almost brand new the hotel is showing signs of wear already. Our drawers were dodgy and throughout there is at times a drain smell. There was always enough loungers by the pool but the lovely sashes and umbrellas are already stained & ripped.  The website says the location has ‚Äòkept all its local essence‚Äô this means the hotel is in the middle of a building/dump site. Free shuttle to town though so use that to get out.  There was a healthy mix of older couples younger couples and mothers/daughters & friend groups. Nice entertainment every evening.

We opted for an adult only holiday this year for the first time and it was the best decision ever  no screaming children or shouting parents it was absolute bliss.  The staff at this resort are absolutely wonderful and make this hotel what it is and the management should be proud of them all.  I want to mention some by name as they were amazing  the animation team Karin Titif & Simo who were just incredible ( Titif is a Lifeguard but should most definitely be in the animation team) amazing job these boys are doing.  Tariq in the a la carte restaurant was amazing & the restaurant & bar staff were excellent Oussama was the kindest most hardworking waiter I‚Äôve ever met & only wished I could bring him back to England to work in my hospitality business.  The hotel rooms are beautifully decorated and kept pristine clean by the housekeeping team.  The whole decor of the hotel is lovely and very inviting with a warm welcome daily.  The food offering was brilliant and lots of choice for everyone & the snack bar served a good variety of food & drink.  If I had to say anything negative it would be queuing for drinks was sometimes a problem with not enough staff for the volume of guests and the reception staff mainly one man in particular not very helpful but overall a 5 * from me for a most enjoyable holiday.,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julietwheresromeo
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Zineb G wrote a review Aug 2018,50,"""A must try""",My holidays at Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only are sadly over üòî I wish I could stay longer in this amazing place. I enjoyed being there. Everything starts from the reception you will notice that the staff is lovely from day 1. Thank you Adnane and the others (they were available 24hours a day).  The idea of offering one night at the Restaurant Ksar Asni is well-thought even though I would have preferred to eat it at lunch rather than dinner to value it more. The food of Chef Ilham is delicious and the waiter Tariq is to the small care. There are many activities; night shows make you feel the exotism of Marrakech. I enjoyed particularly the Arabian show and Moroccan night (for the Eid). Honestly the staff is lovely and doing its best. For the buffet what can I say?! I loved the variety proposed. We feasted on three meals the teams are doing everything to please you whether it is to cook you a colorful omelet in the morning or whether it is to grill some tender skewers they are trying to welcome you and to give you the best attention they can. The chief Adil is always checking if everything is okay. I attached some photos of the buffet to let you see by yourself.  The Lifeguards are doing very good job Titif went to the other pool in 41¬∞C to bring us deck chairs and umbrella because the pool was already packed when we arrived. Reda and Abdeljalil are doing tasty mojitos and pi√±a coladas.  Thanks to Leila as well that was making our room clean everyday.  The garden/pool/fountains are beautiful it makes you relax and the equipments are to the top despite the fact that it lacks irons in rooms (as in other 5 star hotels).    I also did not like that some customers were rude to some employees just because they wanted to criticize and they wanted more than it is already given but this has nothing to do with the hotel itself it is about the mindsets of people.,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/626zinebg

Great experience going to Marrakech ridiculously hot and the hotel was wonderful. I've read reviews about people being rude food being samey etc but as for us we didn't experience any rudeness and the food can be samey but that is lile every all inclusive hotel. I've read the snack bar being slow but they wasn't for us. 15 minutes burgers chips and pizzas were out and were delicious. The hotel do a really good thing in which if you stay more than 4 nights you get a free Al A Carte meal and that was gorgeous. The entertainment staff very friendly and keep you entertained so thank you Simo Titif Salim Karim Fati.  A huge thank you too both Azddine amd Ayoub who treated us like royalty.

It‚Äôs very rare that you meet such genuine friendly people in the service industry but this hotel shines through their employees- A special mention to ‚ÄòTiftif‚Äô who made us feel like family from the moment we arrived he brightened our day whenever we saw him! ‚ÄòOussama‚Äô who waited on us most nights in the restaurant was simple amazing at his job. Me and my partner work in hospitality and would of bought them both back to London if we could! The whole animation team were great fun and full of energy- loved to see they were able to dine with the hotel guests at lunch...    Great room always sparkly clean. Buffet food great- really fresh and lots of choice even as a veggie.    Al a carte restaurant TERRIBLE don‚Äôt bother going! Both food and service let the whole place down. Shut it please!    Cocktail‚Äôs weren‚Äôt great but wine and beer were fine for us- would of been nice to have the option to pay for higher quality spirts and better wine rather than have to stick with the ‚Äòall inclusive‚Äô offer.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,ewhittingham2017 wrote a review Aug 2018,40,Our first holiday in Marrakech,This Hotel has only be opened a few months so was experiencing a few teething problems. However it was a beautiful hotel. the bedrooms were spacious the beds very comfortable storage was good and the bathrooms had two sinks and a great shower.  There were two pool areas a quite pool with swim up bar or the pool where music played a stretch class in the morning two classes of aqua gym and even a lesson on belly dancing. They also had a Yoga class held in the spa by a professional coach. All these were carried out by the amazing pool side staff with passion and fun.Plus they were very friendly and helpful.The entertainment in the evening was also good.  We arrived very late in the evening and we requested if we could chang our double room to a twin. The reception staff could not have more accomodating and when we asked the next morning if we change the room( one of the teething problems) again the staff were helpful and did not hesitate to make sure we liked the new room and we were happy. The two reception staff I dealt with were Maria Admane and Rachid who took our cases and made sure we were settled.  Our waitress in the dining room was Rajaa once served she always remembered our preferance on beverages and was so friendly pleasant and helpful. The buffet food on offer was very good with an excellent choice which we never tired of.  The couple of issues I had the Customer Services ManagerHafsa was very proffessional listened and noted my comments. They went the extra mile to ensure we enjoyed our stay. My daughter and I had a fabulous holiday because of the wonderful friendly staff. we would definitely return.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Nantwich, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ewhittingham2017
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Rojaho94 wrote a review Aug 2018,40,Is a good hotel but could be great...,We have travelled widely and stayed in a number of all inclusive hotels abroad so feel well-placed to give an honest opinion.  Pros:  1. Cleanliness - the whole hotel is spotless and is constantly being maintained - around the pool the gardens the rooms etc.  2. The food is better than your standard all inclusive fare- in fact it is excellent. Plenty of choice cooking stations replenished regularly lots of fresh veg salad fish fruit meat choices etc. Love the little pastries!! The staff in the kitchen wear gloves too.  3. The staff- almost without exception the staff are helpful polite hard-working and they smile a lot (not easy when they are being over worked - see cons)  4. Two pools are large and never got crowded. Plenty of space for sun beds and lying in the pool  5. The entertainment is average and starts about 10pm- good fun.  6. The weather here cannot be faulted!!! Hot hot hot!  7. Large spacious room with well equipped bathroom and plenty of storage space. Everything is new and works as it should! No problems with the shower like previous reviewers.  8. Excellent WiFi all over hotel  Cons-  The Achilles heel for this hotel is the lack of staff who are manning the bars- most nights we have had to wait 45 mins for a drink while in the lobby bar and often had to wait more than 20 mins at the pool bar for a bottle of water during the day. In the evenings there is one poor waiter who is trying his best to serve all the hotel guests while one more is behind the bar making drinks. One reason the queue at the lobby bar is so long is that people are ordering two or three drinks per person at a time (including cocktails which take time to mix) as they know how long they will have to wait for a drink. Ridiculous! One simple solution would be to open the snack bar at night for drinks only and employ more staff (there are plenty in the restaurant where service is excellent).  Unfortunately this would stop us returning as we do not want to spend our holiday in a queue every night! And we are not big drinkers but enjoy a couple of post-dinner cocktails.  Basically the management are letting down their hard working staff in this one aspect. Please fix!  This is the main reason we are not giving this hotel 5 stars.,Date of stay: August 2018,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rojaho94

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Anthony N wrote a review Jul 2018,50,Lovely and relaxing holiday in a beautiful hotel with very friendly staff,Myself and my fianc√© booked a 7 day holiday to Be Live Collection Marrakech and we were not disappointed. The hotel is adults only which as a teacher was a lovely reprieve from having children around however this did not put a dampener on the activities and everything that the hotel had to offer.  We arrived at around 10.30am well before the check-in time however the reception staff were so helpful and managed to get us in our room really quickly. They made sure to give us our wristbands so that we could access the food and drink straight away which was really helpful.  The facilities at the hotel are incredible. The pools are absolutely lovely and cater for every need. The quiet pool has a swim up bar which is a lovely touch and the other pool has activities throughout the day. The entertainment staff are incredible! They are so attentive and they get everyone involved. They did not stop from their start time until they finished. The lifeguard Titif was particularly lovely. He included myself and my fianc√© right from the moment we got there and made us feel so incredibly welcome.  The bedrooms are exquisite. They are spacious and roomy and they are so well kept and clean. The bathroom was so lovely it had a huge shower with a lovely shower head that my 6 foot 5 fianc√© could easily stand under properly. The only thing I would suggest is to bring your own hairdryer as the one in the bathroom is not very powerful and you have to hold the button down which is quite laborious when you have long hair.  The restaurant staff were incredible! I can honestly say that I have never seen people work as hard as they did. If they were not setting the tables up they were clearing them getting drinks refilling wine etc. They are an absolute asset to the hotel and each and every one of the staff were friendly and helpful.  The restaurant itself was lovely. The food was so fresh and delicious and there was a good variety of different foods to cater for every taste bud. The desserts were a particular favourite for me as I do not eat chocolate and there were so many options for me that I do not get in every restaurant.  The Moroccan wine was lovely - I had the rose and thoroughly enjoyed it - it was sweet and smooth.  Overall I cannot speak more highly of the hotel and the staff - they could not have been more attentive and honestly could not have worked harder than they did.  I would definitely recommend this hotel and would certainly visit again.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anthonyn458

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,isimace98 wrote a review Jul 2018,40,"Very enjoyable resort, unfair remarks in previously written reviews...",My partner and I arrived at the hotel around 4 before usual check in time however the staff were very friendly and helpful throughout the procedure whilst being efficient with preparing our room. Good start. From this we experienced very welcoming hospitality from all staff members throughout the hotel during the whole week we were there. Every enquiry and question we had was dealt with effectively from the people on reception. In addition to this the daytime entertainers were brilliant. I would especially like to thank ‚ÄòSimo‚Äô (in pink top) and ‚ÄòTitif‚Äô (red top) for their wonderful effort for making our holiday so enjoyable. They regularly checked on us and made good convocation. Their English was very good considering it was their third language the activities they provided were all for good causes and enjoyable as everyone who participated seemed very happy in doing so. Both swimming pools were cleaned daily and perfect temperature for hot weather. Only advisory comment i would make on this is that the quiet pool with the swim up bar may be better set at the entertainment pool however this is a very minor criticism. In terms of food and service it was noticeable that during the day from the snack bar the shot of alcohol into cocktails varied drastically in amount however this I think this was due to maintaining control of people‚Äôs condition during the day as evening cocktail were noticeabley stronger. In contrast I believe the curfew for alcohol should be later than 12 however it is understandle and respected due to religious and cultural differences. Quality of the food was very good and tasted great however variation of food was limited. Other than this the food drinks and service delivered as expected.  All in all I think for a hotel which is only 4-5months old and developing its target audience and clientele it deserves much more credit than what I read prior to our trip. This hotel will go on to great things the way it is going and for its very reasonable price would recommend it to anyone I know. Would also revisit myself.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Martin L wrote a review Jul 2018,30,Management Sirs You let your staff Down,I wish to clarify that back home I am a General Manager and am often told that my staff let myself and the Company down. Retrain and hopefully improve. However the opposite is true with this Hotel.    This is our 3rd day of 7 in the Hotel. The Staff are amazing. The Dining Room Staff create and serve an excellent combination of different Meals and desserts all to a high standard.  The Bar staff always with a smile and friendliness serve a large number of delicious Cocktails.  The Animation team are so much fun in 2 days I have tried both Yoga and Archery for the 1st time. Friendly and always with a smile on their faces.  Again the Room Service and Reception always friendly and doing an excellent job.    Now all these things are extras and great. But the basic function of any Hotel is a Room to be fit for function. The room we were allocated was Room 2016 the Room itself spacious and beautiful. I have attached photo to see. However on the first night the room was like a Sauna. I had seen in 2 previous reviews people with issues with air conditioning not working. I went to Reception as always friendly and sent maintenance to our Room at 10.30pm. He vould not get working and would take time for him to get into ceiling to try fix we agreed he would return the next day and repair and I slept badly in a warm room. The next day true to his word he got working. These issues can occur but they seem to be an ongoing issue at this Hotel.  That evening I had a shower while having I noticed the Bathroom had become flooded. The water does not go down the drain again I have seen this in numerous complaints on Tripadvisor from other past Hotel guests. This is a complete Health and Safety violation that any Hotel guest should have to worry about slipping on a flooded Bathroom Floor while leaving Shower. These Rooms should not be in use until this problem is solved. But I am guessing Management sirs are trying to maximise number of guests for extra profits. Shame on you Sirs. Customer safety should always be priority and these Rooms taken out of use till problem fixed. We were moved by Reception as they obviously could not fix the issue in this Room. Our new Room is the same quality and beautiful with working air con and Non flooding Shower.    But Management Should take a lead on this occassion. Their Staff put their Hotel Guests first can never do enough and are 5 star in everyway. The Hotel itself is beautiful and in general perfect. But the management who allow these issues which are obvious on Tripadvisor reviews for months now and continue to allow these Rooms be in used with disregard for Guests you truly do let your Staff down having to continuously deal with Guests for these problems reoccurring.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/355martinl

Reception team are friendly helpful and extremely informative.    The rooms are absolutely fabulous modern and spotless cleaned to an extremely high standard each day by the wonderful housekeeping team. The beds are very comfy and big. The only thing I would advise is if you have thick hair bring your own hairdryer it can take a while using the one provided.    There is a wide range of food available at all times of the day lots of Moroccan food and also other choices of pizza etc if you‚Äôre a little fussy (like me). The snack bar also has a good menu great food and service with a smile. The bar is open until midnight I believe so stock up on drinks before this time.    The pool grounds and facilities are beautiful and constantly being looked after by numerous members of the team who always give you a smile as you pass. There has been some serious thought that has gone into every detail of this hotel and it really does add the wow factor.

We have just returned last night from a holiday we will always remember. We travel 5 times a year and have never experienced a holiday as good as the past two weeks have been. From the minute we arrived everything was 100% perfect. The reception staff were very accomadating on arrival. The rooms are beautiful and absolutely spotless. They are cleaned every day to perfection. The grounds of the hotel are spectacular and even more beautiful at night. The restaurant was very good. Always something different to eat and it was nice to try different morroco foods. The staff were fantastic. They were always smiling and very happy to assist you. The snack bar is also available for lovely food and the staff there are great fun and always serve with a smile. There are two pools which are both beautiful. We preferred the pool.with activities. We would go to the quiet pool for a drink in the evening and relax in the water sitting at the bar. I don't know where to start with the animation team. They were just amazing. There was aqua aerobics Stretch archery darts water polo dance belly dancing Arabic lessons yoga football and other fun games daily. There was a mojito party and the team entertained us with a show which i thoroughly enjoyed. They were like a family that worked so well together managed by a brilliant manager who also organised the night entertainment. Titif is one of the lifeguards whom I think should be part if the animation team. He has great English and a great entertainer. The other two lifeguards were also gentlemen. I learned Archery for the first time and Karim who is a star was a brilliant teacher. The bar staff at both bars were fantastic. They waited on you hand on foot when it wasn't too busy. Mohamed was great in the bar. Nothing bothered him and was always smiling even under pressure. The entertainment was brilliant. There was something different every night and we really enjoyed them all. We have been to Marrakech 5 times and this has been the best. We will never forget the amazing experience you have us and hope to return in October. So please ignore any bad reviews as I could not say one bad comment on out two week stay.

On the whole our trip was lovely and we enjoyed the hotel a great deal but there were some undeniable problems which makes it hard to give it a glowing appraisal.    Positives first. The room was brilliant. Spacious clean and with a comfortable bed. The pools were both nice with an ample supply of sun-loungers including - mercifully for my girlfriend who burns easily - several with drapes around the frame. One pool has very loud music pumping virtually all day so if you are after a quiet holiday it is worth bearing this in mind as Be Live attracts quite a young crowd. Music did not play at the other pool.    Food was consistently good at the buffet with a wide range of choice. My girlfriend is a vegetarian and never struggled to fill a plate. Tagine dishes unsurprisingly were the nicest.    The drinks on the whole were good. Admittedly there was a limited selection of wines and beers but I found both the house versions to be perfectly adequate. The cocktails however were not very nice and below the quality of pretty much everything else the hotel offered. Cheap mixers made them taste sugary and a bit unpleasant - the mojitos perhaps being the one exception. This needs more investment as it is a painfully obvious shortcoming.    The location was good close enough to both the city centre and the airport. Free shuttle buses can take you into the heart of Marrakech from reception. It is undeniably remote though so walking anywhere is neither advisable nor particularly scenic as you‚Äôre effectively in a barren field.    Activities were also very impressive. Everything ranging from archery to yoga was offered led by the always-energetic animation team. A gym was available to use for free.    Our room was opposite a slightly perplexing venue known as the ‚Äúsports bar‚Äù. I say perplexing because it sits locked until 10pm every evening which always seemed ludicrously late considering the lobby bar quickly fills up as guests look for a pre-dinner drink. Many can be seen standing while others dragged over chairs from elsewhere. The sports bar only swings open its doors when most are ready to go to bed which seems a big waste as we would have visited more often otherwise.    Our main issues centred on the staff. Or more specifically about half of them.    Firstly it is important to say that the waiters and bartenders in the lobby bar and in the buffet restaurant were exceptional - among the best I‚Äôve had the pleasure to be served by. Mohammad really stood out in the bar working quickly and skillfully while managing somehow to remember my drinks order every time. There was a rhythm and organisation to both venues that made them work effectively coupled with the staff‚Äôs unwavering courtesy.    However the gulf in quality between those two places and other areas was big. The snack bar staff were consistently bad. Surly in manner and slow in delivery. It took a ridiculous amount of time to get served a drink sometimes despite employees often loitering at the end of the bar. I could sense they had their own responsibilities but they needed to be willing to jump in when they were not busy and there was a growing queue. The one person serving would often bustle off for five minutes and then return without any apology or explanation. We liked the food served there but it was often so torturous trying to get the waiter‚Äôs attention to order (and then for the food/drink to arrive) that we stopped bothering. The efficiency and organisation of the lobby bar/restaurant really needs to be imposed on the outside snack bar.    Similarly reception staff proved tricky to deal with at times. We were told when we arrived that there was no record of our new booking (we changed the dates within about an hour of first reserving our room online). To be fair we were given wristbands and let into the room but the rigmarole that followed was needless. We were made to feel like it was our fault this had happened and our responsibility to get the third-party booking platform to provide confirmation. It was not particularly as we‚Äôd provided them with printed confirmation documents. Guess what? It turned out the hotel had lost the updated booking dates. Our booking agent confirmed it had been sent to them the first time. Did they apologise? No.    It also took needless effort to get the hot water in our shower fixed as it was cold at first. Not just hours - days. It was eventually sorted but this is a basic requirement and shouldn‚Äôt need us to repeatedly visit the front desk to pester them about fixing it. Our key cards also stopped working for reasons that were never clear (we weren't keeping it near our phones as they kept suggesting) and again we were not offered apologies for the inconvenience it caused us traipsing back and forth.    These might be minor enough issues but the reception staff are your first point of contact in the hotel. It left us feeling a bit unnerved and uncomfortable which is not the dream start to your holiday.    Overall however this was good value for money. It is a very nice hotel with great grounds and facilities. We had a fantastic trip. These problems - which I see have been raised already - can and should be addressed to bring the hotel up to the standard it deserves. They weren‚Äôt just one-off dealings but a consistent attitude we encountered. A re-evaluation is needed to make this place top notch.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jack_Hardy123

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,jennyfer-me wrote a review Jul 2018,40,Not yet a 5 star,Good but not great - not yet 5 star.  Plus -  Beds very comfortable.  The food was very good catered for my gluten free request. One of the guys was amazing in the restaurant.  Showed World Cup upstairs in a large room and provided a make shift bar.  Very clean.  Used the gym daily it‚Äôs a reasonable gym.  Minus -  Shower not great it leaked into the bathroom when you had it on too powerful.  The area for drinks after dinner needs to be bigger. We couldn‚Äôt get a seat after dinner so sat at the snack bar a little away from it.  It would be good if the sports bar opened earlier than 10pm.  Service at snack bar very slow.  Tips -  Take your own towels big deposit for pool towels.  Book your own excursions from trip advisor not via the events coordinator at the hotel.  Remember where the shuttle bus dropped you off. We couldn‚Äôt find it and got a taxi back but the taxi didn‚Äôt know where he was going.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Hannah wrote a review Jul 2018,30,Honest fair truthful,"Arrived for the start of our week at be live collection myself and my partner are not difficult people and are always very polite and respectful. The black guy with glasses (did not catch his name) on reception was the very first person we came into contact with. He was very abrupt unwelcoming and quite frankly very rude to us for no reason at all. We couldn't for the life of us understand what was his problem. We were told to wait 10 minutes for our room which was absolutely fine no issues in waiting but when we came back we were told ""I asked you to wait 10 minutes you have another 3 to wait"" ? We shrugged it off as a bad sense of humour but were slightly appalled at his treatment towards us. We were shown to our room by a great bell boy stopping to show us a few things on route we tipped him for going the extra miles for us. The maid had done a wonderful job at tidying the room the whole stay which we also tipped to show our appreciation. The room was very spacious great queen bed lovely bath robes provided and powerful shower but yes quite leaky. Resturaunt staff were smooth and efficient and Special thanks to Yassin in the lobby bar what a charming man fantastic fluent English held a good conversation and very nice man to talk to. May I suggest a promotion to reception for him. Pool bars were naff. Quite difficult to get even remotely tipsy in the end we gave up and stuck to mint tea water and fresh orange juice that was avaliable at breakfast only. Snack bar forgot our food order after we sat patiently for a good hour waiting one lunch time. Food was luke warm pretty bog standard but liked the modern decor and service was good. Swim up room was the highlight of the holiday and the lively band that played on the Saturday at the pool party and the belly dancers were very good. Big deposit for towels and made to pay local taxes but didn't bother us too much. I recommend popping into the shop on site to pick up some natural skin products and spices. Be live has a far way to come but it will get there with a little more willingness of going the extra mile.",Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Essex, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/273holly
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,MDigby wrote a review Jul 2018,30,Not all that.,Came out to the Be Live Collection for one week for my birthday. We was a bit sceptical after seeing some of the reviews but thought we will make of it what we think. The good. The food is amazing the buffet food was top notch and the desserts were amazing. The drinks were weaker than I would've liked but just had to ask for it stronger and they would. The room we had was a swim up room and that was the highlight of the hotel. Was like having our own little villa in the hotel the room was big and immaculate and the maids always cleaned it to perfection. Lovely big shower and bath and balcony. Was peaceful compared to sitting round by the looks would recommend having a swim up room.  Yassine at the lobby Bar was fantastic spoke perfect English and was the most polite person that worked at the resort. Very attentive and made excellent drinks. Made my partner feel very welcome and I agree. The gardens were beautiful and well kept and the whole hotel in general was very clean! defiantly a 5 star in that respect.  On arrival to the hotel the reception staff shouldn't be on reception rudest people I've come across working at a hotel. A certain black receptionist with glasses was very rude to me. be warned they'll charge you a deposit of ¬£100 for your pool towels and the sneaky part of it is. they only give you one pool card. So when I got to the room realising this and returned to the lobby he laughed at me and said 'ha you've lost it already' assuring him I couldn't have I've just walked from the lobby to my room. he gave me another one and muttered 'this is yours try not losing this one'. One several occasions at the restaurant it would take ages to get served for a drink and given cutlery we was sitting for about 20 minutes and asked 4 people for drinks and cutlery and wasn't seen to to which I then stood up walked over to a member of staff and demanded to be seen to was extremely angry with this and this happened a few times as the staff were more interested and attentive to the French guests and not the English. This has been seen very much throughout our stay.  We booked a night to go to the hotel a la carte restaurant. my advice don't go there. it's not all that. When making the booking my wife was given a slip of paper for the booking we went to the restaurant and they asked for the slip I knew it was in the room but went to the reception as the room was on the other side of the hotel to ask for another slip. Maria the receptionist then said to me 'i can't print out another slip you get one if you lose it you can't go'. I laughed and said it's in the room on the otherwise of the hotel can't you just print another for me. no was the answer so I went to the room got the slip and we was seated. but as said. We preferred the buffet.  The entertainment of an evening is poor. It starts around 10 / 1030 and by that point you can't get a seat and you've eaten your dinner ages before that so you are sitting around waiting for something to happen and when it does. it's the same dreary music every night. We go to bed straight after eating as there is no point staying up for it.  We didn't go into Marrakech but did do some excursions. 4 of which only 1 lived up to expectations. This is not the hotels fault granted but the rep at the hotel provided us with the trips and we was very disappointed. Don't do the quads or the horse riding. We did the Hamman twice as the first time was pure bliss but the second time was such a let down it ruined the first experience for us. It was called Lotus Priviledge. I also wrote a review on there page too.  All in all I would not go back here again. 5 stars it is not. Only good things the food and the room. Very upset and disappointing week away.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MDigby

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Nicola P wrote a review Jul 2018,40,5 days of sun,We arrived at the hotel. It wasnt much to look at outside. But inside was very nice. The resort has 5 stars on the door. This is not a five star resort. Its a 4 star resort. There is no room service and the mini bar only has water when they remember to re-stock it. The suite we had was very clean and massive. Lots of room here. There were no issues with getting a sunbed by the pool and tgere are lots of umbrellas. The food is ok. Its one restaurant that is a buffet that is very repetitive with the selection of food they serve. Breakfast was not too good. There is one other restaurant. Its a Moroccan restaurant. Its serves only 2 set menus which is ok it you are not fussy. Both restaurants are very poor when it comes to allergy advice. Half the time in the buffet there were no cards to tell you what the food was either. The swim up bar was great hafid was the bar tender there for the time we were there. He was very friendly and chatty. A font of knowledge and very informative. All in all a great time was had.

Please do not let any bad reviews stop you from visiting this gorgeous 5 star hotel. Free shuttle into town which takes 20 mins max so definately not out of the way at all always sun loungers available shop and reception always open the food was so nice lots of variety and we particularly loved the food in the snack bar.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,2Scotsontour wrote a review Jul 2018,50,The amazing staff make this beautiful hotel a holiday to remember! We'll be back next year!,"As our first holiday together as a young couple we have created memories that will last a lifetime and this is largely due to the fantastic staff!    We stayed in a ""Swim up"" pool room which was spotlessly cleaned by the cleaners each day who were always so cheery and respectful if we needed a little five minutes longer to get out the room for them. We were made to feel super safe with the lovely security guards who kept watch over the rooms and the whole hotel is guarded with a wall with secure gates and some more lovely security guards at the entrance.    I would like to point out one waiter who I am sorry to say we never got his name but one night after staying at the Sahara dessert my boyfriend had a ticky tummy. The waiter kindly made him up a special Moroccan cumin powder and gave us a few large bottles of water to take back to the room. After consuming this my boyfriend woke up the next day feeling back to his usual self! So if the waiter gets to read this please accept our thanks once again; it was so kind of you.    As a vegetarian I was also extremely well catered for by the chefs and one even remembered each night and was keeping stuff separate and recommending dishes to me! For non-vegetarians the food was also fantastic. You had so much choice from sushi to Italian to Morroccan... you name it! So if you're a ""fussy eater"" there's no need to worry! You'll also find yummy pizzas paninis etc at the pool bar for during the day.    The manager and a gentleman who I believe to be the owner of the hotel were also wonderful. You could tell that they would have sorted any concerns immediately if you had any.    Our overall thanks however must go to three staff of whom we now consider our Morroccan friends and have kept in touch with and who are more than welcome to visit us in Scotland! Rida Mohammed and Titif we owe all our happy memories to you three. You are an absolute CREDIT to the hotel and we had such great laughs with you and you looked after us so well and we thank you SO much. Thank you also for accepting us at your time of Ramadan and for teaching us some Arabic which the other staff were impressed with (perhaps not at Gareth's pronounciations!) They were so attentive kind and as a young woman made me feel very safe in Morocco. Half the time we spent at the pool we'd be laughing and joking with them. We would go back to this hotel simply for the staff who were truly wonderful.    My boyfriend also booked me a surprise spa which was wonderful. I had all the treatments available and I would recommend it as it's really reasonably priced. Again the staff there were just so lovely! I even had a whole pool to myself during the treatments and a lovely Morroccan tea!    My boyfriend participated in the archery which he loved trying out we played basketball and there's tennis pool activities football crazy games board games etc so you'll never get bored! Towels are also available with a deposit. There's also a sport's bar which opens until 2am. All the activities occur in the ""louder"" pool (still chilled enough to lounge around at with some nice music) and then there's an amazing quiet pool with a pool bar in the water. Please be respectful in that pool which is all about chilling out. There's evening entertainment upstairs every night if that's your thing and there's also some in the trendy bar downstairs.    Please remember that Morocco is a Muslim country and it is therefore disrespectful to be very loud and drunk. This is not a hotel for people who like to get super drunk and get loud. This is an elegant sophisticated hotel and of course it's fine to have a nice modest time and cocktails (which are fantastic by the way) but being outrageously drunk is a sign of disrespect. It is illegal in Morocco to serve alcohol after 12. So if you're looking for a party holiday book Ibiza! Please also be aware that this is a five star hotel so don't go walking through reception or sit at lunch in your bikini/tops off/swimming trunks- you'll be turned away (pool bar is fine for swimwear of course)!    The hotel offers a shuttle bus into the Medina for free at scheduled times throughout the day and will collect you free of charge too! You'll find out this information at reception and you'll also be able to book other excursions like we did such as the Sahara dessert camping experience Atlas mountains and beach Essaouira.    The only recommendations (not criticisms by the way) are as follows:  1. A few more labels on the foods would be helpful (although there is some)  2. The actual shower block is higher than the floor level so the water can get on to the floor.  3. An ironing board and kettle would be nice extras to the room (but we did actually ask for an iron and we were given it).",Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2Scotsontour

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,GlenAshley wrote a review Jun 2018,40,One week all inclusive,We have just returned from a one week stay at the Be live hotel in Marrakesh (the adults only resort) I would like to start by saying that the bad reviews really should be ignored as we had a really great time!! The hotel is lovely there‚Äôs seems to be a mix of mainly French and English guests. I didn‚Äôt see or experience any favouritism as I had read in other reviews. The facilities and food are really great (especially the deserts). The only thing I would mention is that the slow draining shower is a bit of a pain as it does start to over flow after a while. Most of the staff at the hotel are really great and can‚Äôt do enough for you. We have visited North African countries before and have never received such good service. They honestly can‚Äôt do enough! Oussama our waiter at dinner was absolutely excellent. He remembered our drink orders and where we liked to sit. He made us feel so welcome and always had a smile on his face and should be commended for his high level of service. Abdellah and the other gentlemen on the front desk were extremely helpful and courteous. Also Tarik in the Moroccan restaurant was great. We did find some of the female staff on the reception desk quite rude and really not helpful I‚Äôm not sure if this was down to the language barrier but we were left feeling quite awkward and embarrassed by the way we were spoken to.

Eventually on our last full day the water was changed completely in the pool and it was lovely.. however this meant we only got to use our upgraded room for a day!    The staff were all friendly apart from a couple who just didn‚Äôt seem to want to be there there or help.    On our last day we were due to checkout at normal time but had to pay 1200 Dirhams to keep our room as our flight home wasn‚Äôt until late that night.

I was not aware before travelling that other reviewers assumed this hotel was 5 star if I could give it a rating I would say 3-4 star with luxury touches and my reasons for this being is I see a 5 star hotel as a place where room service is standard long trousers if not black tie for dinner and al a cart menu is the norm this hotel is an All inclusive all you can eat and drink buffet type wear what you like for dining so consider that before you assume a 5 star service!! None of this affected our thoughts on the overall experience as I say because I have different expectations of what I consider 5 star to be and how much it generally costs in a major city around the world.    pros -    most staff extremely welcoming and willing to go that extra mile to make you time at this hotel more memorable these people were Hasfa (customer relations)KarimAmine Fati Salim (animation) and our waiter most evenings Mourad the service provided by the bar manager was also exceptional as was the other main restaurant waiters and waitresses unable to name mention them all.    Most comfortable Bed and pillows ever experienced away from home.    No problem finding a sun lounger or even a cabana (if your lucky) at any time of day at the quiet or activity pool    Delicious desserts    Gardens - the pools and restaurant are surrounded by the most beautiful landscapes gardens and the gardeners take pride in the enjoyment they give.    Cons-    If you do your research you will find that the hotel is a courtesy bus ride out of the main hub or the Mediana it takes approximately 25 or so minutes but other than that or trips to be booked if you go with a travel company there is absolutely nothing else to see or go to around the hotel this is by no way a criticism of what the hotel has to offer but should be considered if you suffer from cabin fever!!.    Additional info -    Hairdryers slippers a fridge with water and a free safe deposit box are provided.    There is a small gift shop selling essentials like suncream a few toiletries crisps and sweets alongside reasonably priced gifts if a trip out is not up your street however as we found out in the departure lounge At Marrakesh airport there is a traditional craft shop selling most of the items to be bought in the souks at labelled and you can pay in either Diahram or euros also a small leather shop selling bags purses shoes etc.    The patio door in your room opens at both ends something we only discovered after a week of our stay as part of our party were at the very far end of the hotel on the ground floor this was quite concerning as we found that one of them had been unlocked he whole time.    There is a cash point machine in the reception area however if you wanted to change money at reception we found that you need to do This first thing on the morning as some days they were unable me to change even small amounts by lunchtime.    If you consider the souks to be too much for you consider a visit to the artisan ensemble which is the other side of the gardens surrounding the mosque where the curtesy bus drops and picks you up here you will find all the crafts to be found in the souks like the basket maker Weaver leather goods jewellery etc all situated in a cool courtyard environment with a cafe in the middle no hustle or bustle and the prices quoted are the prices you will have to pay there is no bartarring here but we found the prices to be less that we had paid during our first visit to the madina earlier in the day.    I cannot express how much a visit to jardine Marjolle is a must in the Geliz area slightly north west of the Madina the gardens in Rue Yves Saint Lerant are beautiful we were there for about an hour and it was a lovely break from the mid afternoon heat in the canopy of the amazing garden and colours of the pots and museum this area also hosts some lovely boutiques selling tasteful traditional Moroccan goods at a more premium price however if you like a home from home it‚Äôs also where you will find shops like monsoon Zara H and m etc if your after a change of scenery than pool drink cake sleep and repeat.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thehappygoluckys

Positives:  Really nice hotel very clean and modern.  Restaurant and bar was great. - steak and lamb was so tasty!  Pool areas 5* - no fighting over sunbeds one pool had music the other was quiet.  Pool bar was amazing and the barman here was very good!  Room was clean nicely furnished huge bed.  Spa was nice offered discount for an hours massage.  Gym was good for a quick work out.  Weather - 30 degrees+ everyday not a cloud in the sky (end of May)  shuttle into town worked fine and is free.    Negatives:  Front desk staff not that helpful could have been a bit more friendly. However they did let us leave bags for 3hrs after midday checkout and let us eat and drink until transfer arrived. We used the pool shower and changed in the toilets near reception as had no use of a room.    Snack bar staff pretty lazy - doing the minimum etc.  Slow service in the Moroccan restaurant seemed slightly under staffed.

The weather was beautiful but the hotel was pretty basic.  Room was ok....shower flooded everytime you used it.  Mini bar was completely empty.If you wanted anything in it then you had to pay a ridiculous price.  Food was okay but not a lot of choice.  Drinks were not branded spirits.  We had a late flightbeing picked up at 6pm. Check out was at 12pm. They charged us ¬£60 to keep our room on for three hours and then at 3pm promptly cut our all inclusive wristband off so we couldnt get a drink for three hours. They also do not provide a shower room or any facilities if you have given up your room and need a shower before you leave.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Veness_family wrote a review Jun 2018,20,Honest review,I have just returned from a very short 2 night last minute break away as a surprise trip for my husbands birthday.    I paid ¬£360 for 2 nights swim up room. (I paid a premium as I booked the night before arrival).    We took early flight from lgw (‚Ä™6.20am‚Ä¨) so arrived in Marrakech ‚Ä™at 9am‚Ä¨ local time. The queue through immigration took an hour! Tip: go to Marrakech airport website and you can pay to bypass all this vip fast track. unfortunately we needed at least 24hrs to book so was too late but in future wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to book.    We got a taxi from airport which took aprox 25-30mins (about ¬£11-¬£12).    When we went to reception desk to check in they told us our room wasn‚Äôt ready (‚Ä™11am‚Ä¨) and to come back ‚Ä™1.30pm‚Ä¨. They did however put our bags to the side and gave us wrist bands so we could get food and drinks. I informed the lady on the desk it was my husbands birthday that day and she just smiled blankly. I thought that was a little disappointing as previously 5* hotels would normally be interested to know that so they can put a card in the room or some choc on the bed or decorate a dinner table or something but oddly nothing! They also took an unexpected 1000dirums (approx ¬£83) as a deposit for towels and robes refundable when you check out.    Anyways we thought we‚Äôd make the most of the time and headed straight to the spa. Staff were really friendly and helpful. We booked 4 hours of treatments each. (2 hours over 2 days pp). The spa wasn‚Äôt cheap ..that cost about ¬£320. However the treatments were lovely. Staff were very pleasant. Spa needs some TLC considering hotel is only 4 months old but none the less we enjoyed it.    Walking around the grounds/pools etc it seemed smaller than anticipated. Very calm and quiet.    When we got to our room it was very clean and well furnished. They had nice little touches like a plate with a few little morrocan sweets the usual toiletries a razor toothbrush slippers robe. All looked promising. The robe was a little worn. My main concern however was the sewage smell coming from the bathroom. I‚Äôm not one to normally complain but I didn‚Äôt want to smell that for our entire stay.    Reception sent a maintenance guy who came and did get rid of the smell. Well until you flushed the toilet and then smell came straight back. Or if you turned the shower on.    We spoke to reception again and then got free shuttle bus to souks. Bus was supposed to collect us and 10 others at 11pm to return back to hotel however did not turn up! We tried calling but no one was getting back to us. We waited until midnight then decided to get a taxi back as was so late.    When we got to hotel we asked them to pay for the taxis which they refused. There was no apology.    In the morning we asked  If we could have late check out due to room issues and shuttle bus incident and again they refused. Unless we wanted to pay ¬£60pp. In fact when we did check out they wanted to cut off our wristbands so we could have no food and drink. (Check out is at 12 and our transfer was collecting us at 6pm). When I said we can‚Äôt be expected to not eat or drink till then the words I got in return were ‚Äúwell did you have lunch on the day you arrived?‚Äù.    I would definitely return to Marrakech. I would however NOT recommend this hotel as I would not return there myself. I would look at finding somewhere closer to the souks and better customer relations.    In my opinion and in agreements with majority of other guests staying there this is not a 5* hotel.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Veness_family

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,lulewis2018 wrote a review Jun 2018,50,5* quality with fantastic staff,Not sure where to start with this review as there were so many excellent aspects to this resort. I have just got back (Friday 15th June) and I am already looking to book next years trip as I just had the most relaxing 10 day break ever.  The rooms are well appointed and as it‚Äôs not an enormous property fairly close to all the great faculties. The bed is huge there‚Äôs a large flat screen tv a cute garden area and space enough for 2 people to move around freely. Some reviewers have moaned about not having tea making facilities in the room. Really? Anyone with any sense would have researched where they were going to stay and therefore known this was not provided. Also you are in a foreign country do as they do or don‚Äôt go there!  The staff were nothing short of amazing! I had stayed at the Kenzi resort at the same time last year and a lot of the dining room staff remembered me from there and treated me like royalty for my entire stay...special thanks to Anil and Hassan (evening shift) and all the others that made my holiday so memorable. All the staff in the dining rooms were friendly and attentive without giving the impression they were hustling you...they remembered little things such as I like ice with my water and ensured it was on the table without me asking for it.  The entire property was kept spotless at all times and the room cleaners did a fantastic job cleaning our room and changing our towels every day. The pools (one quiet and one more lively) were super clean and for those that like activity there were fun games to play throughout the day. The more lively pool bar did sometimes have slow service but that was more to do with a lot of people ordering cocktails which take time to prepare so perhaps one more staff would alleviate this. To be honest the weather and environment were so gorgeous waiting wasn‚Äôt really an issue...and yes there are wasps around the bar but that‚Äôs to be expected there were virtually none around the pool which I was very pleased about.  The food was lovely...there was a carvery most evenings (lamb chicken turkey and beef) along with various tagines (fish meat and veggie options) sushi lamb chops salmon pizza a pasta station numerous salads...the list goes on! Breakfast was what you would expect in a buffet style and there were always something to choose lunch was the same and I enjoyed something every day.  The bar although small served fairly decent beers and wine and service was good...the guys there just didn‚Äôt stop working...also as it was just across from the dining hall if you wanted a beer or spirit with dinner (which I saw some people have) you could get that yourself and bring it in with you...not a hardship in my opinion.  The staff at the front desk were ok not over friendly but efficient. We arrived approximately 12pm and were shown straight to our room which was great as it‚Äôs an early flight and it meant we were able to unpack and head out to lunch and then the pool.  One thing to look out for is the shower will flood the bathroom but we also had a bath with shower attachment so it didn‚Äôt impact us too much however had we had a room with just a shower it would have been unacceptable.  WiFi is available throughout the resort and although patchy at times was adequate for our needs.  A safe is provided free of charge and there is a fridge in the room for water (which is placed in rooms everyday)  The a la carte restaurant was a disappointment. It‚Äôs nice inside but the food was grim! The bread roll was like a rock and the tagine was served with just stringy meat and nothing else. This was the only negative aspect of this trip and I honestly can‚Äôt wait to go back!  The staff are a fantastic asset to this resort and should be commended for their professionalism and courtesy to their guests.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Greater London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lulewis2018
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Kate B wrote a review Jun 2018,30,"Ok, lots to improve on but nice short break",My husband and I booked for a short break to celebrate our 22nd wedding anniversary we booked a swim up room; room was lovely lots of storage the private space outside was really fab but not being able to grab a couple of glasses and a bottle of wine to sip on while using the swim up lounge area was an unnecessary inconvenience.    The quality of the furniture around the hotel was really great and if they sort out the lack of staff this hotel could be a little gem.    The food wasn‚Äôt great you so t go hungry but it was not very varied and was lent great quality.    The special restaurant was really poor service was shocking we got up and left after sitting for over 30 minutes without even a glass of water.    A few things that was a real disappointment was the personal touches we have always received when traveling for our wedding anniversary not even a congratulations this was not just lacking for us we met a couple on their honeymoon and they didn‚Äôt even get an acknowledgment of their milestone!    Don‚Äôt book a late flight the cost of a late check out is not worth it your wristband is cut off at checkout ( not even permitted to retain as a keepsake) and you are unable to even get a drink!!    The was clear favouritism of French guests I‚Äôve not ever encountered that before and it was really evident.    We had a lovely time because it was a special occasion and we weren‚Äôt going to let the flaws ruin that; until they bring in more trained staff and improve the quality and choice of food I think the reviews will not gain this hotel a 5/5,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IrishKate
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Hardon66 wrote a review Jun 2018,20,Holiday with Family,Having read the reviews which was quite mixed. I personally wanted to go to this particular hotel? Even though it look really nice in the pictures.  I was disappointed with the service of some of the staff. The receptionist had no manners always talking in their own language (quite rude)  The food as mentioned by another reviewer was bland and same ole thing each day. One of the bars you could not take the food away from.that area whilst the burgers n buns too hard and processed food. NOT good  Hotel was located in am area where nothing is there so u can't even venture out for a walk as there is nothing to see.  Rooms decorated on.. . But not the finishing touch n it great.  Overall it just ok... Not as what it makes out.  That's such a shame  The shuttle bus which operates from the hotel to Marrekesh central broke down one evening so we were expected to push it. And another evening it just did not turn up at all. The last journey at 11.00pm. we were stranded for over an hour. We got taxis the 12 of us who were stranded and once we got back to the hotel advised them of what had happened... the night receptionist refused to pay the taxis and was so rude too. Poor taxi man.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,megan121290 wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Relaxing week in beautiful surrounds,My partner and I stayed in this hotel for a week at the beginning of June. We requested a room upgrade to a swim-up room and were so glad This hotel is spotless and the room cleaners do a great job every day.    The food in the buffet was a bit same-y but fresh fish and meat and salads nonetheless. As a coeliac I did not have much choice when it came to the a la carte restaurant but I also did not request it beforehand.    Oussama waited on us in the buffet for most of the week and he was fantastic. Speaking to him in a mix of French and English was a pleasure as we both helped each other and he never let your glass of ros√© go empty. He is a gem for this hotel and will go far in the hospitality sector!    We usually sat at the relaxing pool in the mornings and in the afternoon moved to the beds outside our room as they got the lovely evening sun.    The free shuttle into Marrakech was a great extra and is definitely worth exploring the souks.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/megan121290

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Paul J wrote a review Jun 2018,30,Nice enough place not 5 stars though,Having read many of the reviews we took note of the fact that the showers would flood the room [and they do] and acted accordingly IE we placed towels on the edge of the shower base to stop water overflow. The room was very nice however the view over barren land and building sites was far from 5 star so we never used the balcony. The building seems to have used nice materials however the workforce used to put it together seem to have done an incomplete job lots of finishing touches required.  Staff mixed behaviour some are very polite and friendly others don't seem to have the time of day for anyone this could be a language barrier or a cultural difference but if they want to be 5 star they need to be more international. The entertainment staff seem faultless though and both my wife and I had lots of fun at the pool. She has since booked belly dancing lessons and in fact was belly dancing in the living room today with her daughter.  Previous comments about the food we feel were over critical and we both enjoyed all our meals. We were surprised how much the flies and the sparrows enjoyed the food too. The sparrows could be seen making happy faces on the food counters every meal apart from late evenings this obviously as they had their fill and it was bedtime.  We had an early arrival with another family - Lance and family who we loved - but the desk staff made us feel more like a hindrance to the hotel rather than guests arriving. We had to fill in forms as with the airport and then wait 5 hours before we were given rooms. This was not discussed by travel agents we were not given a guided tour we were not told what was happening we were merely told the rooms would not be ready for half an hour repeatedly. We were aware that another couple were expected to stay at the hotel for 6 hours without food after checking out so these kind of issues are not 5 star treatment.  We had fun there irrespective of all this as we have a good sense of humour.,Date of stay: June 2018,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C4015FBpaulj
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,goa_ele_love wrote a review Jun 2018,30,Nice Stay. But NOT 5 stars.. yet!,I just returned from this hotel after a 4 night break with 3 of my girlfriends. I had some concerns after reading reviews from past guests but as we were already booked it was a ‚Äòwait and see‚Äô!  I‚Äôll start with the negatives:-  It‚Äôs a lot further from ‚Äòanything‚Äô than expected so pretty much nothing to do outside of the hotel. The hotel bus shuttle is handy and definitely needed unless you want to pay for taxis. You MUST book your seats prior to getting in.    The food is oh so boring limited and tasteless. Apart from the salad bar and sweets the mains are dreadful. The same unseasoned food served up day and night. Same tagines every night or weird dishes that consist of breakfast or lunch leftovers.. you either exists on salads or end up with a plate of strange food items that don‚Äôt really consist of a ‚Äòmeal‚Äô. It wasn‚Äôt even ‚Äòmezze‚Äô or ‚Äòtapas‚Äô which would‚Äôve been somewhat acceptable. When they did serve up anything half way exciting there‚Äôd be a long queue for it and a measly portion given so wasn‚Äôt worth the wait.  Drinks in the restaurant were limited. House red white or rose which were all like vinegar. You could have soft drinks or water but don‚Äôt dare ask for a hot drink as these were not available other than at breakfast. If you wanted one you had to go get it yourself from another area of the hotel and bring it back...... which leads me into the main gripe!  You were severely restricted to where you could get refreshments. For example you could only get a hot drink from a certain bar at a certain time. When you managed to get one it wasn‚Äôt nice anyway.  Alcohol was cheap and nasty. Cocktails were horrible (came from a dispensary machine with a little shake here and there to make it look like it‚Äôs being mixed professionally and unlike any cocktail I‚Äôve ever tasted in other words best to avoid. I did. I ended up sticking to water. Hardly all inclusive.  You‚Äôre not allowed to eat by the pools. Annoying as it‚Äôs an adult only hotel so I‚Äôm sure we know how to behave with food. This was a shame as it meant you couldn‚Äôt enjoy the full poolside experience. Staff never come and ask if you‚Äôd like anything it‚Äôs all self service. The hotel is very strict on having ‚Äòreserved areas‚Äô for eating and drinking which made no sense. One night the lobby bar ran out of tonic water despite having some in the pool bar but refused to get it... pool shuts early so too does the pool bar and (snack bar 6pm).  Which means that this hotel really only provides a ‚Äòfull board‚Äô experience and is not ‚Äòfully inclusive‚Äô. If you miss strict timings you go without. I tried to order a salad at the snack bar but I was refused as salads are not served after 4pm but I could order a pizza or burger until 6pm)??????    No afternoon tea type option no all day ice cream no bar snacks crisps/nuts...no tea/coffee making in rooms and mini bar is charged and very expensive!!!!  An early flight home meant we would miss breakfast but there‚Äôs no ‚Äòpack lunch‚Äô option available. We were told we could take stuff from the buffet if it were open but they would not provide a bag to put it in so pointless. They didn‚Äôt offer foil wrap or anything as an alternative which is a bit mean.    Entertainment is awful! Butlins style with not very good dancers/singers. Apart from a guy who sung for a while before ‚Äòmain act‚Äô came on who was good and should stay on. It was same old thing night after night. You‚Äôre better off going to bed early.  The bar was lacking seating that we had to sit in the lobby every night but one on our last night as the hotel was empty of guests. Luckily they just had pre downloaded tunes instead of an act. On Friday night couples were playing cards in the bar. Get the picture?    Spa really pricey! It seemed to be empty with few guests so they‚Äôd be better to reduce prices and actually do some work. My friend tried to book and each time it was closed when it was advertised as open. When she mentioned this to one of the spa staff he was really rude to her.    Finally on to the positives!!!  - it is a beautiful hotel well kept and smells amazing in the lobby!  - has security which was reassuring  - staff are a great asset. Very friendly and helpful (apart from the previously mentioned restrictions imposed on them). Although one or two of the snack bar staff let everyone else down as less friendly and less helpful.  - Rooms are lovely with the most comfortable beds ever!!! Although bathrooms have a large window into the bedroom with a transparent blind so no privacy from fellow room guest or anyone outside if room curtains are open whilst using the bathroom. Looks great but a questionable choice. A proper blind would make all the difference.  - everywhere is spotlessly clean.  - lovely manicured gardens  - has two pools one with music and activities and a quiet one if you want to relax quietly. This too is spotlessly clean.  - Plentiful sun loungers and parasols with a few curtained cabanas dotted here and there. (Grab early as these are popular).    All in all we enjoyed our stay. Weather was great had time to relax in the sun which was what we wanted. Rooms lovely and comfy. It was good for 4 days but definitely no longer with these current problems.    I‚Äôd say that with some easy and obvious changes this will be a wonderful hotel and could honesty claim 5 stars/ all inclusive but not yet.  This is an honest and I hope constructive review so I hope it helps you to make a decision and the hotel to take on board and improve in areas required.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Watford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goa_ele_love
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,ExplorateurParis7 wrote a review Jun 2018,10,Disastrous and scandalous experience at the reception,We arrived to spend a weekend in this hotel to have some rest a family time and enjoy the hotel because we have been satisfied by the comments on TripAdvisor.    Everything was perfect rooms and pool. But when we had to check in they said that we have to wait until they receive ¬´ the reservation ¬ª from Spain. The receptionnist Loubna was really really cold and unwelcoming. It‚Äôs a shame for a 5* hotel to welcome people like this. She asked to pay additionnal fees for bracelets and towels and we accepted. We asked questions and she was unhelpful. For example we asked about restaurant opening hours and she replied that all the answers are on a paper in the room. The reception manager Abderrahmane came and asked her if there was a problem I told him ¬´ yes we booked a pool view ¬ª (we have paid more on purpose for that). He replied ¬´ it‚Äôs between me and her ¬ª. I was astonished by the unprofessionalism of the answer and the best is yet to come.    My father asked for more kindness and better service the receptionnist manager spoke louder and told my father that he doesn‚Äôt have the right to raise his voice and then the nightmare begins.    I told him that we have the right to speak freely and everyone on their site was complaining about the reception service it‚Äôs not normal to welcome clients this way as if the receptionnists were the clients. He started getting nervous came out from the reception and told me ¬´ If we were outside I would have broken your face. ¬ª The CCTV of the hotel and my phone recording can attest about that as his colleagues came around to avoid him punching me.    I was astonished : It‚Äôs the first time in my life that a 5star hotel ¬´ manager ¬ª speak to me as if I have met a drug dealer in the street. He called the security who told us ¬´ please forgive him ¬ª. Consequently we took our luggages back and we chose another hotel. We are wondering whether going to the police station to report a threatening behavior from a ¬´ professional ¬ª. I hope that the directors of Be Live hotels can read this and recruit in the future better skilled and polite employees on competencies and not only on CVs. Abderrahmane and Loubna had a lack of experience and professionalism.    What a pity the hotel seemed very good but the experience lived was traumatic.

On arrival to Marrakech airport it is so laid back it's unreal.. we wasn't aware on arrival you must fill out a small form about you personal idendifcation..    Do not forget to fill 1 out otherwise you will have to go back and start again.))  after this we was stood in line overall 1 hour 20 mins to get through security!!    TAXIS AT AIRPORT- if you haven't booked transfers to hotel and just want to get to your hotel quickly like us... always haggle with the drivers. They will normally ask you you for about 400 Dirham roughly 25 English pounds. Don't be scared to to haggle on price that's what morrocois all about..  REGARDS    BE LIVE COLLECTION HOTEL- on arrival taxi pulled up to gates and checked taxi with metal detector security let him through big gates overall security all round fantastic..    Hotel pros and cons..    Hotel pros    - lovely and clean all the time. Cleansers work so hard all day.  - beds are big and really comfortable.  - staff are always trying to help.  - both pools are great and clean .  -food is good but subject to your preference and choice.    HOTEL con's-  there is a problem with walk in showers they flood if have it on powerful.. had to turn it towards wall and put towel down to slow water escaping.    - entertainment doesn't really start till 10.30pm by then alot people heading back to room after long days by the pool.. atmosphere all around becomes low..    OVERALL EXPERIENCE ..    Me and my fiance are 30years old from United kingdom. All we wanted was a nice relaxing short break to kick back and unwind.. we do love a good laugh and a few drinks along the way so if I'm truthful 4 nights here was perfect for us.. if I stayed any longer I do believe I would start to get bored.. Only so much you can do within hotel .( Don't take that as a negative )) defiently would recommend hotel but not for a long period of time..    Just a quick note for when you depart back to Marrakech airport you must fill in another identification form to get back through security.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,M√•rvƒ´n M wrote a review Jun 2018,10,Hotel area is nice but the service is more than disappointing,We stayed here as couple in June 2018. The Hotel and the room are nice. The standard is the usual like the hotels in the neighborhood or the typical big hotel areas.  But the service was more than horrible while our whole stay. It starts with an unfriendly receptionist who didn‚Äôt help us with our wishes and problems around the hotel. The second is the stuff at the so called Snack Bar close to the Pool area. The whole stuff is chatting and ignore your wishes to order a drink. Sometimes you have luck and they hear to you but also in an unfriendly way cause of you they have to work. The third the service at the restaurant: you have to wait a long time until they service you with drinks. The same long time you have to wait until the waiter clear the table. Very often the garden and the pool area is full of empty bottles and glasses from the last day. That‚Äôs not the standard what I expect for a high class hotel. At least we had problems with our deposit what you have to pay at your first day and you normally get it back after your stay. There is a friendly manager we told our problems and he promised that he will fix it but without any results. Pity! That‚Äôs not a good start for a new opened Hotel.  There are a lot of beautiful hotels in Marrakech and same wise a lot of competitors so the next time we will book another hotel.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/m_rv_nm
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Amy c wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Best Holiday of my life.,After reading some of the reviews i was terrified myself and my friend had made a terrible mistake....    I have just got back from the best holiday of my life! The hotel is stunning there are cleaners on site all day so the place is spotless.    The rooms are huge with the nicest beds i am no engineer but i worked out if you turn the shower head slightly away from the edge the leak on the floor doesn't happen!? we found the room was cleaned at least twice a day. The staff are great Amine in the swim up bar is the best he made the holiday for us. We spent the week at the quieter pool and had no complaints.    Our Aircon worked fine and we had no issues only downside is no tea/coffee facilities in the room but there is always a bar open to go get one - just make sure to clarify i you want English tea not Moroccan mint tea.    Reception staff where great we struggled to get our currency changed up as we arrived on the weekend and they had to wait till monday for it to arrive. Adnane on reception was so apologetic and checked on us every time we walked by.    The food was varied and a new dish was out every meal - steak lamb chops fish etc. The restaurant team where always friendly and had our drinks order memorised by day 2. Only used the snack bar twice but food was nice.    Evening entertainment was good something new each night and the cocktails are kept flowing. We did a day trip organised by our rep as two girls alone we were advised not to venture into the city centre alone the trip worked out about ¬£35.    We had a visit to the spa get a facial my skin has never been so clean highly recommend the package we had of a hammam massage and facial.    Overall we loved our stay and where so sad to leave. Will 100% go back.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amyc6423
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Katie W wrote a review Jun 2018,30,Don't avoid it but maybe don't rush there.,We stayed at the be live collection adults only hotel for 10 days this June. Here is a comprehensive list I strongly suggest you read before making your decision.    Pros  The hotel is immaculately clean. The cleaners are easily the hotels hardest working staff.  Bed‚Äôs a very comfy  We had a Swim up room which meant we had a pool outside our room. This was the highlight and is very much worth the small extra cost.  Bar and Restaurant are nice looking.  Sports bar looked good but empty during our stay as hotel was quiet.  Quiet hotel but we did start to see an increase in guests during our stay which in turn made the negatives improve slightly.  There are two pools one for sport and another for relaxing. We stayed by the relaxed one which is great and you can sit at the bar in the pool which is really good.  Spa is really nice and reasonably priced.    Cons    Here is the problem...  Receptionists can be rude and poor at english.  We ordered a twin room but got a single double bed. So check before you go!  Had to wait for our room even when arriving at 7pm due to a broken door.  No staff really speak english  No food or drinks in room  BIGGEST THING IS THE FOOD IS COLD and bland. You will wait at the buffet for them to bring it out fresh but somehow it still comes out cold. In all fairness by our last day it became luke warm so maybe they are trying to improve as everyone has complained.  Flies an small issue cover your wine if sitting outside at night.  Snack bar okay for lunch but don‚Äôt get sandwiches as they wont have any filling. Also on two occasions we had taw pizza here.  The ‚Äòspecial‚Äô restaurant you can only visit once. Don‚Äôt even bother we had to go to the buffet after.  When we complained we didn‚Äôt get anything but a blank stare luckily another manager who was dealing with yet another complaining couple caved to our demand for a late check out due to our unwanted late check in.    Overall if you can put up with poor food then the hotel is actually good and well priced. And I do believe as they get busier and learn from complaints they will try and improve.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B1760FHkatiew

As soon as we had arrived the animation team welcomed us to the hotel and went through the entertainment programme for the day and the week that we were staying. All of them - Salim Karim Amine Fati Abdelatif and Mohemad - were fantastic and kept us entertained all day every day and also for the evening entertainment. They were full of energy and kept us laughing and busy all of the time with the different activities they were offering.    The reception staff were very helpful and couldn't do enough for us. The rooms were spacious very well equipped and kept very clean by the maids who visited daily. The food was lovely and plenty of it to go round.    The hotel grounds were lovely it was nice to walk round after our evening meal - very peaceful.    All the staff at the hotel were very polite friendly and helpful.

The rooms are immaculate the cleaning staff are great.Yes there is a problem with the showers flooding which does need rectifying but if you have the shower power on half it‚Äôs good.  The waiting staff are AMAZING! A big thank you to Hassan and Mourad and the PR Manager Mounia is a credit to the hotel.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,beadycharm wrote a review Jun 2018,30,Not quite 5 star,Never written a review before so please bear with me...  Just come back from a weeks stay at this hotel and can confirm that although very nice it‚Äôs not quite up to 5 star standard.  As a solo traveller I had to say that I found the staff a little rude (not all of them) a lot of the time they would ignore you or forget that you even ordered anything - word to the wise scrub up on your French before you head here as they seem to respond more to anyone that speaks to them in French unfortunately mine is not great.  Rooms are nice was going to say very clean apart from the small blood stains I had on my bedding :-(  The air con in the room is beyond frustrating. On my first night I called reception to ask if they could send someone to look at it as the room was very warm. Admittedly within an hour they had sent someone and they got it to come out cool. Sadly it did not stay like this and every evening my room was at a constant 25 -26 degrees very uncomfortable and makes sleeping difficult.  Food overall is very good with wide selection in the buffet restaurant unfortunately none of it is very hot in temperature. My advice is to eat during the day at the snack bar by the pool as this food is freshly made and comes out hot!  Other than that everything was good - pool areas are very nice and the man that runs the little shop on site was really friendly. Hope this helps.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beadycharm

The restuarnt staff are very pleasant and attentive El Bachir and Chef Saad to name a few. The staff really did make our stay that much more enjoyable.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,deknight75 wrote a review May 2018,50,Missing You All Already!!!!,"We""ve just got back from a great stay at this hotel - if coffee and tea making facilities in your room and a minibar are the most important aspects of your holiday then leave this place well alone    The hotel is great - its new its fresh and impeccably clean. You could drink your coffee off the floor its that good! The rooms are simple and as previously said in another review everything works which is great. If you want as we did your room will be cleaned everyday with fresh linen and towels. Yes the shower needs a door but a bit of care minimises flooding the bathroom. Most important is hot water and there's plenty of it!!    Hotel facilities are spot on - the restaurants provide a great selection of food morning lunch and evening and the quality is amazing (Make sure you get a freshly made omelette at breakfast!). We know our food and there is nothing wrong with what this hotel provides and theres plenty of choice which changes everyday - if you look carefully!    The spa (which we did find expensive) the gym the pools and the games are great. Entertainment in the evening hits the nail on the head too. Drinks are plentiful and nothing and I mean nothing is too much trouble for anyone who works at this place!    But what makes this place is the staff - they are friendly helpful and sincere. We made some great friends on this holiday who showed us how to dance do some archery keep us fit and do their daft hotel dance!!    Take some time and get to know Amine (an amazing guy who is a credit to the company and hotel). Get to know Imad (a great lad who will attempt to get you to do all the games by the pool!). Get to know Fati (loves her dancing but is an absolute nutter!! LOL). Everyone is great. Everyone who works there. They're all friendly and if you bother you'll get to know them and they'll educate you on their culture.    We loved it.

But according to hotel this was never the caseend of conversation. Food in restaurant looked OKon closer inspection actually very little choice. Not much to compliment salads and hot food luke warm. Choice at breakfast was also poor and god forbid you wanted something cooked fresh. Snack bar was very goodotherwise we would have probably gone a bit hungry. Roomsswimming pool area's pretty much as previous reviews. Staff some really goodsome not so. However if management treat them as they do gueststhat would explain a lot. This company is only interested in turn over and let no man stand in their way. Our last 2 days were spoilt by hotel being filled with families. Children everywhere running about in bar 11.00pm. Swimming pool with kids and inflatables. Exactly what you expect in Adults Only. I have not managed to get an explanation and dare I expect an apology. They just do not care. Just hope you do not have to rely on management for any problems. I never over expect and usually pretty satisfied. But next time in Morocco back to 4 star Riu Tikida Beach Adults only.

Formalities complete let‚Äôs go into the hotel.    The rooms were spotless with all things working.

Facilities the pools are always clean and staff at hand if any issues. The various activities are great fun and the staff really do encourage you to enjoy them. You do need to pay for the spa however it‚Äôs not that pricey and all treatments are explained.    The restaurant is good. I think the food can get repetitive but quality is good. Desserts were amazing. I would suggest food is labled to avoid asking but they do tell you.    The bar well stocked and the cocktails are great.

The night of my check in we had missed the evening meal by 10 minutes and being a diabetic no effort was made to even supply me with a price of fruit. And on our last day no lunch as the hotel was booked for this festival who had brought in their own chefs so food was not available in the main restaurant but was offer a burger by the pool.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,sls210 wrote a review May 2018,30,good and bad,"we stayed for 4 nights as a couple in the swim up room. the room overall was lovely cleaned thoroughly 3 out of the 4 days we was there! the ""swim up pool"" is just an interconnecting strip of water between the rooms with a few steps down and a ledge to sit. the 'pool' is narrow but came up to nearly waist height.    we booked direct through the be live hotel website and paid on arrival. I recommend anyone to pay when booking or exchange money in the airport - after reading a review on here saying the hotel had a better exchange rate we waited and their rate was awful meaning we had to pay an extra ¬£70 GBP on top of the price we booked for to accommodate their poor rate! Also when booking through the direct site it states the benefit of the swim up room is robes (which were not provided and we had to ask several times for) and early check in. When we arrived we was told that because we was checking out early on the last day we could check in early on day of arrival. Told to come back in an hour then sent away because room was not ready. This happened 3 times with very rude service until 3pm when we could check in - so much for early check in?? We was given our wrist band though so we could use the restaurant.    Wasn't too impressed with restaurant same pizza pasta salad meat and veg every day and not too much variety. Desserts were nice though. Snack bar by the main pool had good drinks and food. We managed to book the Moroccan restaurant for one night was not impressed. Service slow and meat massively undercooked. We asked for water 3 times and was ignored each time.    Shuttle bus is provided to and from the town which we used. Arrived on time. Do not be late as the driver does not wait.    Entertainment staff were very helpful. Amine introduced himself to us on our first day and spoke to us every day was very helpful and friendly. Getting drinks or snacks do take a while so we ordered a few at a time. Activities on throughout the day at the bigger pool or quieter at the second pool.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Anne K wrote a review May 2018,30,"Some good, a lot bad.",I travelled to the hotel expecting a luxury vacation for myself as a single female traveler.    The good:    Pool area is nice not to busy and quit if you‚Äôre at the pool without entertainment.    Housekeeping did an excellent job everyday.    The food in the buffet restaurant is good although the same pretty much every day. But good many options.    Rooms are nice I had a swim up room and stayed most of the afternoons there. Nice and clean good bed.    Good gym could use some barbells or kettle bells. Towel and water (some days) which was nice. Hard to find though.    The bad:    The reception staff is - to say the least - not motivated to do good service. They don‚Äôt seem to think service reaches beyond language. I don‚Äôt speak French but excellent English they did not. And didn‚Äôt make an effort. Most of the information I needed was given when I asked for it ie directions to the restaurant spa etc.    A la carte restaurant is not worth a visit. You have to choose between to set menues and it was pretty much the same food as in the buffet restaurant. Nice guys but the food was not worth a second look.    The bathroom - don‚Äôt expect to take a shower. I did that on the day of arrival and the room was flooding with water after 30 seconds. A technician came and had a look but said the same problem was in all rooms. And no help from reception either. Every day was a struggle to take a shower and avoid flooding the room. And the room had a constant noise from the piping sounded like water was running constantly. Smells bad from the drains too.    I asked for some sodas or maybe a bottle of ros√© for the mini bar but could only choose between champagne beer or spirits with soda. Had to settle for ‚Äòfour beers of my choosing‚Äô and was not able to make a choice of beer.    If the service level and piping gets fixed I‚Äôll come back. At least give me a smile when I arrive instead of looking like I‚Äôm intruding on a private conversation.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Howeller76 wrote a review May 2018,30,Nice but.....,Overall we had a really good break at this hotel......but there are a few niggles that really are easily fixed and would make it a great break. These may seem picky but they add up and left us scratching our heads in amazement.    Room - no robes in a superior room and a mini bar that you have to pay to fill (in an all inclusive resort)    Spa - list of services only in French and you have to pay to use the indoor pool sauna jacuzzi and steam room. Spa is also run by a separate company and you pay separately.    Front desk - tried to change sterling for local currency. They would only do cash for cash no cards and no ATM on site. Cards are ok to pay for room and spa though!    Restaurant - drinks brought to table is always a nice touch but you can‚Äôt order anything other than beer or wine - G&T is only available at the lobby bar and they won‚Äôt fetch you one (despite being 10 feet away door to door). Seems daft. Also some food signage would good - having been told that fish was chicken and chicken was beef I think this would be useful!    Like I said the place itself is generally really nice the touches listed above would make it the 5 star it advertises itself as.    Room was clean and bed comfy shower had good heat and pressure. Buffet food was excellent and as it had Moroccan dishes on each serving we didn‚Äôt go to the Moroccan restaurant. We had treatments at the Spa which were nice and pretty good value for money.    The only really sour note was the attitude of the 4 different front desk people we had. They truly acted as if they were doing you a favour with anything you asked. If these are the first and last experience you have of the hotel then surely they should be happy to see and sad to see you go?! Generally all other staff were really nice. French is the predominant language so worth brushing up before leaving.    We wouldn‚Äôt come back here.

The staff were also very friendly and did their best to help were possible. Actually some of the staff were great. However the hotels service was lacking the quality that makes a 5* hotel in my opinion due to policy.    For example: the restaurant and the bar are less than 4 steps apart. However when I asked for certain drinks at dinner or lunch in the restaurant I was told ‚Äúthese are only available in the bar‚Äù.    Although I‚Äôm sure you could get up from the restaurant and order a drink in the bar and bring it over yourself... this is not 5* service.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,MLBiscomb wrote a review May 2018,50,"Fantastic Holiday, Wonderful Service..",Be Live Adults Only has clearly come a long way in ironing out teething problems - we were apprehensive after reading reviews but had a fantastic time as a party of six. Firstly there were no building works happening whilst we were there and it seems all work has been completed.    We arrived earlier than check in but were provided with bands to enjoy the all inclusive and given a tour by one of the friendly pool entertainment guys whilst we waited for the rooms to be ready.    One our of party had a few issues with noise as their room was near the service area (particularly bad when they were clearing up after the launch party) but the reception staff were extremely helpful and switched rooms with no problem.    The buffet was fantastic with lots of choice (even for vegans!) - it would be better if the food was labelled but the choice and quality was excellent including freshly made pizza and pasta omelettes cooked to order and a fantastic salad bar and dessert selection. The snack bar outside was also great - as you would expect burgers chips sandwiches and pizza all tasty! We didn't try the other Moroccan restaurant on site (one visit complimentary for guests)  although we heard mixed reviews from other guests.    We also didn't attend any of the evening shows although there was something on every evening with an external events company instead we stayed mainly in the bar and sports bar that had DJ's karaoke and singers some nights - and pool table football table and comfy seating in the sports bar. Due to the great value and with birthdays to celebrate we also ate out a couple of times and can really recommend Comptoir Darna and Azar Restaurant for a glam experience (with belly dancers and delicious food) as well as Nomad and Des Espices in the Souks for more casual dining rooftop terraces and good vegetarian/vegan options.    In general we found the majority of staff to be extremely helpful and friendly particularly the pool entertainment team the PR/Guest Relations lady as well as all the waiters and bar staff. There were a few language barriers with the reception team which will no doubt ease over time but they were helpful in booking taxis helping us with dinner reservations and resolving any issues.    There is a free shuttle bus into the main square and souls that runs regularly it will also stop mid-way on request if you‚Äôre wanting to visit the YSL gardens. It was a good alternative to paying for taxis every time ‚Äì although taxis from the hotel to the souks costs around 200 durhams (¬£20ish). All our drivers were fab and in general we felt very safe in the town/square and really enjoyed the souks.    We also made use of the fantastic spa during our visit which we found to be fairly reasonably prices with lots of package options to suit your stay as well as complimentary gym.    The rooms were really nice spacious and clean ‚Äì the showers did flood a little but we just more towels down and got on with it. Safes available in room plenty of room on the terraces too. Housekeeping offered a great service.    During our time there were a few guests who seemed intent on complaining and stirring up other guests. Of course if you‚Äôre the type of person who loves to find problems and complain you will find them everywhere but any issues we had were resolved promptly and in general we had a fantastic time!,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MLBiscomb
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Smeats wrote a review Apr 2018,30,Use the safe in your room,I want to start by saying that this hotel was actually better than we had anticipated. Given the mixed reviews we were apprehensive to say the least! It was very very clean the staff were generally good and the food was slightly better than an average all inclusive. 5* it is not however we didn‚Äôt expect it to be.    We were 4 hrs delayed due to a connecting flight from Casablanca being cancelled at the last minute. Thankful for the WiFi in the airport as we don‚Äôt speak French and ‚ÄòAnnul√©‚Äô appeared on the screens 5 mins before boarding! Have to say the staff in the airport from Royal Air Maroc were not great.    6 hours later and we arrived at the hotel tired and hungry. Check in was faultless and as requested the hotel had arranged for two plates of salad in our rooms which we were very grateful for at 4am. (If in the same situation ask for them to be placed in the fridge) All fine so far.    Day 3 and we return from the pool to find my necklace missing. I hadn‚Äôt used the safe and left it out on the desk in the room - alongside other less valuable items. This one item is nowhere to be found. We turned the room upside down just to make sure but I 100% know where I left it. The hotel investigated and the housekeeping said they had not seen it. Two people turned up later that day and went through both my luggage and my boyfriends to check it wasn‚Äôt there. Thought that was a bit strange. I could not gain a report to say it went missing on the premises from them either as I hadn‚Äôt used the safe. The customer service manager was as helpful as she could be but it really ruined the holiday to be honest. We tried to make the most of the rest of the holiday and pretend it hadn‚Äôt happened.    The evening entertainment was standard hotel entertainment and as it wasn‚Äôt very busy this took place in the lobby bar. I‚Äôm assuming when it‚Äôs fully occupied it would be upstairs in the conference-type room. There were session singers karaoke African dancers etc. Not really our thing but everyone else seemed to enjoy themselves.    2 pools in the hotel. 1 had the aerobics and activities happening with music playing and the other was quieter with no music and a swim up bar. The weather was changeable with it being April so the pools were a touch on the cold side! The swim up bar pool was quite cloudy which put me off getting in - not sure if seeing the gardener wading through it in his wellies the day before had any bearing on that!    The snack bar was open 10-6pm and served food to order. It was ok burgers paninnis pizzas etc. The service here was particularly relaxed as in it was table service but you could sit there for 20 mins before someone came over. We went up to the counter a few times to be told to sit down. Not a major issue but this could be improved.    Breakfast lunch and dinner in the buffet restaurant was nice. Lots of salad options and rice/bread etc. Nothing was labelled though so you were guessing what you were eating some of the time! Service was good in here.    We didn‚Äôt eat in the a la carte restaurant instead opting to head into the new town where we ate at Barrometer Marrakech on our last night. I‚Äôve reviewed this separately.    All in all this is a nice clean hotel with decent food and good service generally. Our stay was tainted by the necklace incident. This has been a learning experience - use the hotel safe!,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leeds, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Samsmeats
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,MarshallBuckley wrote a review Apr 2018,50,"Excellent, most teething-troubles now overcome.",Clearly in the first couple of weeks the new hotel had issues to deal with. Most (not quite all) seem to have been resolved now.  We had a couple of small issues with our room - the balcony door would not lock and the quick flush on the toilet did not work. The door was fixed quickly the flush we did not bother to report.  Otherwise the room was fine - amazingly comfortable bed big pillows.  It seems odd that the mini-bar isn't stocked and that the option to have it stocked costs money but given that bottled water is left in the room and you can take drinks back it was never really an issue.  But these are small niggles and didn't detract from the holiday experience.  The hotel is sparkling clean everywhere the staff unfailingly friendly and polite and the buffet restaurant incredibly good - great variety beautifully presented. (The a la carte was less impressive but that's personal taste).  Plenty of choice of drinks from all the bars (cocktails are better at the lobby bar) - no issues with alcohol here.  The spa was good - though English is less widely spoken here but we managed to book treatments with no issues.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Nav J wrote a review Apr 2018,50,Amazing hotel and service,We stayed from 21st to 25th April and can honestly say it was amazing. I know there have been a few mixed reviews but when I spoke with reception they had only been open properly for 5 days so maybe the mixed reviews were while they were not fully open so some teething problems may of been expected.    The room was so nice and clean and of a good size. For breakfast/lunch/dinner the buffet restaurant served lovely food and it was a different menu every day. The service was always great and not once was any member of staff rude or not helpful.    The evening bar was really nice to chill in at the end of the day they had live bands every night and all the guests seemed to have a great time and getting involved/dancing too.    I didn‚Äôt expect too much when booking the hotel just a place to stay while in Marrakesh for me but I left thinking what a wonderful place it was. It has a good vibe about it everybody seems happy (including guests) Book it and you‚Äôll understand what I mean!,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leamington Spa, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NavJhutti
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Sharon M wrote a review Apr 2018,50,AMAZING !!!!,We travelled as cousins for a girlie well earned relaxation break.    Fantastic animation team - Abdel Imad Fati & Salim kept us entertained all day with fun and frolics by the pool. They were very energetic and funny to say the least! We also got some free Arabic tuition which was a great laugh ;-). The lifeguards Karim & little Abdel looked after us extremely well by making sure that we had clean comfortable sunbeds to relax on while soaking up the Moroccan sun. Ahhhhh heaven!    By night in the Lobby bar Amine the main man went above and beyond first class service by keeping our drinks flowing along with a wonderful smile to top off a fantastic day / night before returning to our room and relaxing in the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in. Our room was well equipped and very clean with maid service daily.    Hotel is well maintained both day and night. The reception staff were very helpful along with the restaurant staff who couldn't do enough for you.The food was delicious and plenty of choice.

It was our first experience of Morraco and we would not hold back in recommending this hotel. The hotel itself is extremely clean and the food is fantastic this includes the buffet and Al A Carte restaurants as well as the snack bar the latter served great food which was always freshly cooked which is not our usual experience of snack bars. The staff were all so friendly at all the restaurants and bars and could not do more for us.

From the moment we arrived on our girls holiday till the moment we left we received the warmest of welcomes including a personalized service from all the staff we encountered within every part of the hotel.Before I start a review of the hotel I would like to say a big thank you to the guest/public relations officer by the name of Hafza. She took great care of us from day one and ensured we had the most wonderful and relaxing stay. Her approach was very professional and also personal at the same time. we really took a liking to her throughout the trip. She made sure we got the best excursion deals educated us on Moroccan culture and much more. It was a shame we didn't get to say goodbye.  The amenities within the hotel are fabulously breathtaking. I would highly recommend the swim up rooms as they have the most outstanding view. The pool bar is a nice touch especially within the hot temperatures. The food was incredible!! Pure Moroccan cuisine. We were quite scpetical having read the reviews complaining about the food but I honestly give it all the praise and ratings. Breakfast was amazing and because its a buffet the variety was amazing. More food served at the snack bar included freshly made burgers and pizzas throughout the day which was a nice touch. Overall amazing 10/10 experience. The only things I would say were a downer were the views however for the location you wont get anything better unless youre in the mountains.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C3958IKmariam

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Darryl B wrote a review Apr 2018,50,5 Star hotel 10 Star Satff,What can I say about this hotel except it was fantastic and please ignore other reviews that are negative as I could not fault anything. Me and my grilfriend had an amazing time here and did not want to come back.    First and the best thing about this hotel are the staff. We had Hassan in the restaurant always catering for what we needed. Faical in the lobby bar making the new cocktail to soon be on the menu 'The 5 Star Faical'. Yassine and Abdul taking care of things in the swim up bar and of course all of this is overseen but the fantastic Mourad. All of these staff were gerneally interested in us and took care of us. Yes they don't all have the best English but you are in morocco so what do you expect. They try harder than us to speak the language.    Pool is was always fund and you couldn't beat the energy from Imad. From day one he introduced himself to us and even had breakfast with me one day.    The food was so good here don't expect English food you are in morrocco and you must dine in the a le carte restaurant tit was superb.    We wine it to town once and the place is crazy but good fun. It's worth checking out but if you don't want to leave the hotel you don't need to because it literally has everything you could need.    We will be back that's for sure thank you again to everyone at be live with special mention again to all of the staff above.

The staff really made it for us always smiling friendly and going out of their way to ensure you had a great stay. They even remembered our drinks orders. Such a huge variety of alcohol on offer including wine beer spirits and lovely cocktails.    This is a new hotel and staff are learning.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Charlie M wrote a review Apr 2018,50,Amazing!,My partner and I (25 & 29) just got back from a 4 night stay and we honestly had the best holiday ever. The hotel was beautiful the staff were incredibly attentive and the food was amazing.    If I am honest I think the things people are complaining about are just ridiculous. Who cares if there is no tea in the rooms- you should be outside exploring a beautiful country. Yes occasionally there are launguage barriers but all the staff have tried incredibly hard to learn new languages - we were polite and ended up making loads of new friends in all the staff. I think people are winding each other up and focusing on the nagatives rather than having a care free holiday.    There are cultural differences but that‚Äôs the beauty of it if you want exactly what you are used to then you might as well stay at home- Morocco is a beautiful country it has so much to offer you just have to step out of your comfort food and try new things. We would 100% return.    We can‚Äôt thank the staff enough for being friendly laughing with us chatting all day with us. Faisal always wanted to create new drinks with us he was brilliant.    A few tips - don‚Äôt bother exchanging money before you go the hotel has a better exchange rate. Book a room overlooking the quiet pool. Definitely go to the soukes (sky bar is a lovely rooftop bar for after). And make the most of your holiday rather than focusing on the negatives- get to know the culture and the people!,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlieM2352

In particular I would like to thank Hasan and Oussama who made our dining experience a delight  4) Free shuttle bus  5) Good variety of alcoholic drinks including cocktails. Local beer was good too.  6) Bar service very good. Did not have to wait long for drinks  7) Excellent swimming pool. Great size and very clean.  8) The most comfortable bed and pillows ever !    Things that could be improved:-    1) Two members of staff cleaned the area around the swimming pool with strong bleach at 4pm on the 15/04 whilst guests where relaxing on their sun loungers. The fumes from the bleach were not very pleasant. Perhaps they should consider cleaning when the guests have gone ?  2) Shower design flawed as when the shower was on fully water seeped over the lip onto the bathroom floor. No drainage in bathroom floor so we had to mop up the water with towel.  3) Internet in room intermittent... better in reception  4) When Bath tap fully on water splashed backwards causing water to run along top of bath and onto floor  5) Need drainage holes along the first floor corridors. When it rained water had no where to go so large pools of water built up  6) Sensor light in pool toilet goes off after 10 seconds    Teething problems which I am sure will be rectified in due course.

Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,HOP130 wrote a review Apr 2018,40,Good overall experience but not quite 5-star yet,My wife and I have just returned from a 3 night stay at this resort.    When you book to stay in a hotel that‚Äôs only been open for less than a month you must expect a few teething problems which is probably reflected in the price.    We arrived early evening to the hotel‚Äôs grand opening ceremony in full swing. In spite of this check in was quick and efficient and we were in the room within 15 minutes. We had a splendid dinner at the buffet restaurant and then got invited to the lavish opening ceremonies around the main pool.    The room itself was large and spacious with a comfortable bed. Yes there are no tea or coffee making facilities like some reviewers have said but you could get a cup of tea/coffee from 8am to 1pm.    The food on offer is of a good variety and quality and we certainly didn‚Äôt have much to complain about for breakfast lunch or dinner. Hafsa from guest relations organised a dinner booking at the Moroccan restaurant for my wife‚Äôs birthday with a cake and the staff singing which was all excellent.    Overall this is a European style all-inclusive resort and it might not be to everyone‚Äôs taste. We‚Äôve been to 5-star all inclusive resorts in Mexico Dominican Republic Cuba and the experience there is somewhat different.    We found the facilities to be of a good standard food was very good and staff helpful and enthusiastic.

This was NOT 5 star.  The grounds are beautiful and the food was presented nicely though was often cold. The room are ok same sort of size as a Premier Inn but with out the tea and coffee. Some overlook piles of rubbish or are near the service entrance and are noisy. There were fag butts in the swim up room pools and they are not exactly swim up.    By far the worst part of our experience was the service shocking the front desk was a joke. Most of the time there was little bar or pool service for drinks.

NOT 5 star    Their philosophy is flawed and the wrong way around. The hotel and its issues come first. The guests well being is a long way down their priority list    Good bits:  Hotel grounds nice food is nice and bar staff and restaurant staff were nice.    But other than this it's awful.  Basil fawlty would be proud of their front desk service.    Our first room smelt of sewage and had views of a big rubbish pile.    Took a day to get us a new room (even tough hotel was max 25% full) and we had to chase circa 8 times. It was our problem to manage.. at no point did they take ownership    New room didn't smell but had other problems. Again our problem to manage. They even wanted me to take time out of our holiday to wait in room for technician. At that's on top of wasting a whole load of time already. No apologies at all. How is that remotely 5star??    There were many other little issues.    Bottom line this level of front desk service is at best 3 star.    And reading the management's response to earlier travellers problems I can say that they just don't get it.    Over promise and under deliver. And just spin you a pack of waffle..hotel comes first then make life simpler for themselves then customer last    The hotel management is simply not fit for purpose.

The Food in the buffet was cold when i asked one of the Chefs for a hot fried egg that had just been cooked he said no and told me to take one that was on the tray i explained that they were cold and he argued with me !!!!! NOT GOOD CUSTOMER SKILLS.!!!!!  As everyone knows you come on holiday for rest and relaxationfrom hetic lives back home and thats why you may choose all inclusive and five star .

Customer service fantastic. the hotel is modern Moroccan style luxury    The food was wonderful huge selection of food and drinks not the place to go if you are on a diet.  The entertainment was fabulous.  they teach you Arabic French by the pool if you require for free.  they give salsa and Zomba lessons.  I highly recommend this hotel.,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/991alman
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,perfectlyclaudia wrote a review Mar 2018,30,Beautiful but not quite there yet...,The hotel is absolutely beautiful with wonderful amenities. It‚Äôs beyond spotless (so much so that you slide across the marble floors). There are two pools - one more active and one more relaxed (with a bar pool) and in between the two is an outdoor bar/restaurant.    There is an indoor buffet restaurant and Moroccan restaurant (the Moroccan restaurant you need to book ahead - and sadly they had no room for us to book a table all week).    The hotel is brand new and there are definitely teething snags that drag the 5* rating down slightly. There was no welcome pack in the room so we had no idea about anything meal times spa times or costs etc. and a large amount of the staff don‚Äôt speak fluent English - so finding out info was a little challenging. The girls at reception however are the best to speak to. One chap didn‚Äôt even know where the spa was.    The showers in our room didn‚Äôt stay hot - and very quickly became ice cold. We did mention this to reception and eventually a chap turned up to fix our tv instead (very random?!) at 10.30pm. We weren‚Äôt too impressed here and our showers never did get fixed.    The food at the pool and in the buffet was absolutely amazing. Lots and lots of choice at the buffet and plenty of vegetarian choices.    There are a number of free shuttles to/from the souks throughout the day - and they are always on time.    We didn‚Äôt use the spa as we had mixed info from staff as to what was included in our all inclusive package - but it was beyond beautiful. There is also an indoor pool and a gym in the spa.,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"St Austell, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/perfectlyclaudia
Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Smile D wrote a review Mar 2018,30,"Brand New Hotel, plenty problems",Be live Collection is a 5 star hotel not to be confused with Be Live Experience which is a 4 star hotel which is just round the corner.  This one is for adults only and opened on Thursday 15th March.    It is a beautiful hotel but there are many teething problems. First all we booked a pool view room and got a garden view.  There was no tea and coffee in the room no robes or slippers till the third day and an empty mini bar which had a lovely note to help yourself. When we asked for these things we got mixed answers even though they were advertised on the website. Please notes this has recently been changed.    We was also informed that we would have to pay a deposit for the room of 500 diram which is just under¬£50 and if you want to use the towels for the swimming pool you would have to pay a deposit of 200 diram per person per towel.    Never in my life have I heard of paying a deposit for a towel?! Make no mistakes here they aren‚Äôt no Egyptian 5000 thread count made by Cleopatra herself kind of towel.    All the drinks are included in the all inclusive deal all the alcoholic drinks are local. You get given a silver arm band to wear for the whole of your stay which entitles you to all the food and drink you could possibly eat.    The pool is lovely and they do have activities depending by on the weather. The aqua aerobics was really fun.    The buffet restaurant serves lovely food of mixed cultures like Italian and morrocan.    The sports bar opens at 10pm and closes at 1am. Glad to say me and my partner was the first to use it woohooüòÅ.    The snack bar serves breakfast until 12:30 ish and their chips taste like MacDonald‚Äôs fries. I highly rate the presentation of the food there.    There is another morrocan restaurant on site which is advised that you book in advance. While we did book we didn‚Äôt end up going as we were having too much fun trying out the cocktails are the bar next door.    The staff there are very friendly most are multi-lingual speaking Arabic English and French    I would recommend the spa but be warned the prices are steep and but are in their local currency. The price list is in French so it would be nice to a English version as well    The gym is included in the all inclusive deal but you can‚Äôt use the heated pool or sauna unless you pay.    Overall a good experience they were still doing some building works while we were there so perhaps in a couple of months they will really live up to their 5star rating but for now I would say they are more of a 4 star ‚≠êÔ∏è rating,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/700smiled
