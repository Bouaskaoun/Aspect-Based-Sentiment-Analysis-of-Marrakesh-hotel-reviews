Riad Dar Anika,Shabnam D wrote a review Mar 21,40,Location location service,The Riad was delightful! A mixture of the old and new. The restaurant was beautiful with preparation to keep us warm during our meals! Food was great! Service and people were amazing. but at 2am someone was knocking on the door continuously. Seems there was no coverage overnight. Also the guests in the room next to us were unwell and coughed all night.

Riad Dar Anika,Jonathan H wrote a review Mar 7,50,Lovely peaceful Riad,Amazing Riad with very very very friendly and helpful staff. We needed a Dr on our second day and the staff were able to call one for us who came to the Riad with 45 minutes and prescribed medication. Save the hassle of going to a hospital. Breakfast was lovely every morning fresh food and plenty of it. The Riad is so peaceful after a busy day in the Medina it feels so relaxing just being there.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonathanhT9304XD
Riad Dar Anika,Sydney R wrote a review Feb 2023,50,"Perfect spot, friendly staff!",This Riad is in a perfect location. Just a short walk to the main marketplace area and right next to the street so it’s easy to get taxis if you need to. It’s also very easy to find. The hotel staff was probably the nicest I’ve ever had so incredibly friendly and made sure our stay was perfect. It has a beautiful rooftop area to lounge at and a jacuzzi if you need to cool off. The only negative thing I would say about this Riad is that the food was ok. The appetizers were excellent but the actual meal was just alright. Other than that 10/10!,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sydremm
Riad Dar Anika,Emily T wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Absolutely Perfect,This riad was absolutely fantastic! A little oasis right in the middle of the busy/loud streets. From the moment we entered the facility we were treated with kindness and hospitality. The rooms themselves are nice but are not the selling feature of this hotel- it is the staff. They are excellent. Very attentive thoughtful polite and caring. 10/10 would stay here again and would recommend to friends traveling to Marrakech.,Date of stay: February 2023,,"Destin, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V718DLemilym

Riad Dar Anika,Ashley S wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Perfect location with Attentive Staff!,What an incredible place! The location is perfect - just outside the gate to the medina so the cars can pull directly up to the front door but 10 minute walk to Jemaa El Fnaa market. I visited in February so it was quite chilly but they kept heaters throughout the riad and I had a space heater (and nightly hot water bottles) for my room. Everyone was kind and helpful - In 30 years of travel I've never experienced such attentive and impeccable service! While I didn't try it out they have a heated pool and outside on the terrace is a hot tub. They are open for dinner and each meal I had was excellent. Breakfast was a variety of breads a type of porridge and your choice of omelet with fresh squeezed orange juice and choice of coffee/tea/mint tea. One thing to keep in mind is the walls are thin so if you have loud guests/young children staying you will be able to hear them. The other guests I encountered were all friendly and respectful. As a solo traveler I felt very safe. Highly recommend!,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Denver, Colorado",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/662AshleyS662

Riad Dar Anika,bettina d wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Lovely stay with EXCEPTIONAL service!,My stay at Dar Anika was memorable. The riad is beautiful and located very close to Bahia Palace Jemaa el-Fnaa etc. I booked a suite which was clean and comfortable. They had a rooftop restaurant that served a great breakfast! I suggest spending some time up there to view both the sunrise and sunset!    What made my stay most memorable was the staff. Hind and her team went above and beyond. The welcome guide to what is nearby and the traditional Moroccan mint tea milk and treats really set the tone to my stay. The team really took the time to help me with what I needed - suggestions to where to visit help with transportation etc. Even as I departed I was given fruit and sandwiches!

Riad Dar Anika,Sandee T wrote a review Dec 2022,50,Home Away from Home,Dar Anika is a beautiful tranquil Riad that we will absolutely come back to. The riad is well appointed and walking distance to most places. The real star of this Riad is the team behind it: Leann the manager; Bader (usually the first person we saw at breakfast) who was always on point professional and warm-he even taught us to make one of the delicious (and healthy!) soups that’s served at breakfast; and last but not least the lovely ladies at the front desk who were so helpful to us and went above and beyond! How many places pack you a lunch to take on your flight?! This is how the Dar Anika crew rolls.    A true diamond in Marrakech.

Riad Dar Anika,Connie77 wrote a review Dec 2022,50,Magical stay in a vibrant city of Marrakech.,At the Dar Anika we were collected from the airport and dropped at the doorway of our accommodation. With vehicles wizzing around us in Marrakech and the view of a doorway set back from the madness we were eager to get inside . The door opened smiles welcomed us. Through the doorway was an unexpected sanctuary. The staff went up and beyond serving us. They were caring helpful efficient conscientious and just happy to help anyone of us. The rooms were spacious are home from home. Petals on the bed and in the bathroom when we arrived.

Riad Dar Anika,Kellie D wrote a review Nov 2022,50,Fantastic,A fantastic and welcoming riad. The staff were attentive and couldn’t do enough for you.  Room are clean.  I recommend being on the first floor as slightly brighter rooms.  The ground floor has good rooms but are quite dark  The main area is relaxing and cozy.  We had food one the first night which was lovely and they had entertainment.  We relaxed on the roof terrace and the staff were so friendly bringing drinks if we wanted them  I highly recommend staying here for a couple of days.

Amongst fountains and olive gardens with birds singing around a central pool where a substantial breakfast of fresh local produce is served every morning is an absolute treat.  The en suite room with the most comfortable bed was huge.  We had a couples Hamam and massage which is highly recommended after a day haggling in the medina.

Riad Dar Anika,Patrick L wrote a review Nov 2022,50,Day trip to Atlas Mountains,The hotel is an oasis of beauty comfort and tranquility amidst the chaos of the old town! The hotel staff are very warm and exceedingly helpful. As a change of pace we decided to take a day trip to the Atlas Mountains that we arranged through the hotel. Our driver was very courteous and his SUV was roomy modern and clean. He drove us up into the mountains where we met up with our Berber guide for a hike to the falls and a walk through the village carved from the mountainside culminating in a wonderful traditional Berber lunch. On the way back we drove through the Agafay desert which at one stop offered a view of snow capped mountains to one side a lake in the distance on the other and rock desert formations all around us. The natural beauty of the mountain and desert was a welcome diversion from the city.,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z6402JSpatrickl

It was a haven away from the hustle and bustle. It was spotlessly clean very comfortable and the staff truly were second to none. They were so kind and nothing was too much trouble. They even gave us a packed lunch to take to the airport without us asking!  Emmen (not sure if spelled correctly) was so kind and helpful.  The staff were able to recommend/arrange bookings at restaurants a tour of the medina and a hammam. The pool inside is very small but beautiful and the roof terrace is a lovely spot to watch the sunset with a drink. Breakfast was delicious simple and fresh. We loved the pancakes; msemen.

Riad Dar Anika,daydreamsofdumplings wrote a review Oct 2022,50,"Absolutely charming Riad- the decor, staff and location",Riad Dar Anika is a totally charming riad. The decor is stunning. The manager (Leanne) is knowledgeable and warm. The staff on reception are absolutely incredible! They helped us out with the little things and can not do enough to assist. Our flight was delayed but they did all they could to ensure we were comfortable at the riad whilst waiting for our flight like sending up freshly squeezed juice and printing our boarding passes last minute. The rooms are ornate and large. Our room had a gorgeous bed and luxurious marble bathroom. They are slightly darker due to barriers blocking insects on windows but very comfy. Breakfast is simple but incredibly well-executed- fresh fruit soup morrocan pancake and bread cakes and the option to have omelette as well. The pool is so beautiful especially at night. It's not the cheapest Riad but the customer service and location is amazing. We didn't use it but there's even a jacuzzi and sunbathing area on the roof. It's a wonderful place to stay and I'm sure will continue to flourish with every new guest that visits.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daydreamsofdumplings

The location is fantastic just a short walk to many major sites close to parking if you have a car and easy access to taxis if needed right in the nearby square. The riad itself was so quiet and peaceful inside and beautifully decorated. Our room was very spacious beautiful clean and quiet- and we enjoyed a greater sense of privacy here than in some other riads we stayed in during our trip to Morocco. We loved the rose petals at check-in. There is a lovely shaded rooftop terrace where we enjoyed a delicious breakfast.    The best part of our stay however was the exceptional service. The manager and all of the staff were so fantastic going above and beyond to make sure we had a great stay. We had a evening flight on the day we checked out but there was no problem safely storing our luggage and when we returned from a little site seeing out in the Medina we were invited to relax in the comfortable room off the lobby and were even served tea and cakes while we waited. They even packed up some fruit and sandwiches for us to bring with us for our journey!

Riad Dar Anika,Avalon1803 wrote a review Oct 2022,50,"Great location, very friendly staff",This is a great place to stay. Location is only 5-10min stroll to the main Jemaa el-Fna square via one straight thoroughfare lined with all sorts of goodies. Bahia Palace is two minutes away.  On your arrival you will be greeted with traditional milk dates biscuits and the famous mint tea and encouraged to relax in the gorgeously decorated surroundings and calm peaceful setting. The staff here are very friendly indeed and will tend enthusiastically to your every need.  There are two or three little terraces on the roof  perfect for enjoying a cold Casablanca beer after a day of souk shopping. The breakfasts are great and there is no set time to have it by.  The manager Leanne is wonderfully friendly. She will give you local tips and tell you hilarious stories if given the chance. She also personally escorted us to the nearby taxi spot on departure. Do take the time to take her aside for a chat if she doesn’t beat you to it.  Cannot rate dar Anika highly enough.

Then top if off with a staff that worked as if we were the only guests there. (We're sure every quest felt the same way). The result of this was a truly great and authentic stay in Marrakesh! We had such a wonderful time immersing ourselves into both the old and new that Marrakesh has to offer. The house manager greeted us personally upon arrival and gave us many great tips to maximize our enjoyment during our stay. The staff was friendly and eager to help at every turn. The hotel lived up to the pictures that you see here and our room was very comfortable and clean. The food was very good and the atmosphere in the balcony dining area allowed the sounds and atmosphere of the city to surround you.    We are so grateful to the house manager as she truly has a sense of client service that flows down to all members of the staff.

Riad Dar Anika,Nizam Patel wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Execellent stay!,We stayed at this Riad for nine nights and found the service of ALL staff to be absolutely amazing. They made us feel at home and the atmosphere was one of love and friendship. It was the managers approach towards her staff and guests which made all the difference. Like a mother to all! We decided to tip the cleaners on our last day only to find out that the tips were not kept by them personally but were forwarded onto the manager who makes sure all tips given to individuals were equally distributed amongst all the working staff on a weekly basis. This shows the level of integrity and honesty amongst all the staff at this riad! From the kitchen staff to the front desk. I would stay at this riad again and would certainly recommend them to friends and family.,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Npnizami786
Riad Dar Anika,Peter B wrote a review Sep 2022,50,High standards in traditional style Dar Hotel,Dar Anika is a great hotel for visiting Marrakesh. Its location just a short walk down a friendly traditional shop lined street from the main square is perfect. Managed by an international manager means standards match expectations. Very friendly and we really did feel at home and able to use the common facilities just as our home. Not the cheapest place to stay but you get what you pay for and Dar Anika gives you an authentic experience with the quality you expect. We loved this hotel and our stay in Marrakesh was so much the better because of the personalised one to one recommendations of places to eat and visit from Liane the manager.,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O6158VYpeterb

From the moment we arrived we couldn’t have asked for a better service/experience. We were given drinks and biscuits on arrival whilst our luggage was taken care of and then met by the managerLyanne. She greeted us so warmly as well as taking us through the local map giving us tips and recommendations of things to do and attractions to visit. Our whole experience at the Riad was superb. The staff couldn’t have been more polite and helpful  going above and beyond at every opportunity - from serving us drinks to organising excursions; from changing money for us to being at our beck and call when needed. We had a truly wonderful time here and would like to extend our thanks to everyone working here Lyanne and her team were truly amazing and we wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this Riad to anyone wanted an A* traditional Moroccan experience!

The staff was super helpful and nice they showed us some good restaurants and places to go around the city and also gave us some tips on things to avoid. The hotel itself is beautiful inside looks like a traditional riad with an open courtyard and a pool downstairs. Complimentary breakfast cookies coffee and tea every day.

Riad Dar Anika,Dr. Barry Travels wrote a review Jul 2022,50,Dont stay anywhere else!!!,We were a group of 18 traveling to Marrakech for the first time. From the time we entered the Riad until the time we left we were treated as royalty. We occupied 9 of the 12 rooms and all of us had a memorable experience. The riad itself is beautiful. I wouldn’t stay anywhere else. The manager Leanne was so nice and we were served food and mint tea upon our arrival. She explained some of the local customs to make us feel more comfortable on our first visit here. Tea and snacks were provided each afternoon as well as fresh milk and dates to our rooms. The rooms were spacious and comfortable. The showers were a bit tricky as they went from freezing to burning hot so just be aware or that. Breakfast is included but give yourself plenty of time to eat as it is served in courses. The first day we were there we were expecting a buffet that we could eat in 15 minutes. Don’t expect that. It is unconventional for us to have soup as one of the foods for breakfast but there is also some fruit bread and crepe-like dishes. It is a full-breakfast but not a European one we had expected. The roof hang-out is relaxing. Each afternoon they serve non-alcoholic slushies which were so refreshing in the Moroccan sun. There is a small pool there as well as in the lobby. The lobby pool is chilly so go for the rooftop water. They do have a bar on the third floor (where breakfast is served) the wine is complementary but other drinks are not free. We really enjoyed sitting and drinking tea or coffee on the ground floor (the lobby and first floor rooms). It is a cozy quiet space away from the noise outside the door. The location is perfect a quick 10 minute walk to the main square and just meters away from restaurants. We had happy hour at the Cozy (not far from the riad) and sat at the rooftop bar for great views of Marrakech while sipping great beer and drinks.,Date of stay: June 2022,,"Allentown, Pennsylvania",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/106barrya

Riad Dar Anika,Michael P wrote a review Jul 2022,50,"Incredible Hotel, Better People",If you’re looking for a beautiful refuge where you will be taken care of by the friendliest people you’ve ever meet look no further!    My experience at Riad Dar Anika was beyond what I expected. I was greeted by a friendly staff who helped me with my bags sat me down in a beautiful air-conditioned room fed me dates mint tea and milk and cookies. Best check-in process ever! The manager came out to greet me and show me Marrakech’s attractions on a map. She taught me how to bargain where to walk and how to stay safe. These warm gestures and the magnitude of service did not relent over my stay.    This place is as beautiful as the pictures. It was a quiet refuge from the intense chaos you can find in the old Medina. And I found that coal dipping pool essential in the Moroccan heat.    Throughout my stay service was timely friendly and very detail-oriented. The breakfast was simple and tasty. In the few days I stayed here I began to experience this place and the staff as home. They were never far away and could answer all of my questions. They never stopped smiling or caring which was what I needed after traveling alone for a week.    When I left in an anxious hurry to not miss my flight the manager even walked me out to a cab negotiated price for me and she sent me off with a homemade sandwich and hug. These are the kind of people I want to come visit again.

Riad Dar Anika,Traveller 22 wrote a review Jun 2022,50,Simply Amazing,We stayed at Dar Anika in 2nd week in June 2022    We had a brilliant time staying here right from the outset. As usual when travelling to a country for the first time you are always a bit apprehensive. We found the Dar Anika on Trip Advisor and read the reviews and decided to stay here and we weren’t disappointed. Everything from the email communications around the flexibility around the bookings to answering queries via the phone prior to arrival was excellent. We booked a private transfer from the airport to the hotel which was managed without any problems and we are so glad we did. Our flight was 3 hours late but the hotel managed this on their end and we were collected from the airport by a professional chauffeur which is absolutely worth it.    Throughout the 7 night stay the service from ALL the staff was impeccable and they definitely go above and beyond and made our stay super comfortable. On the first morning we were met by Leanne who is the manageress of the hotel who took time to sit down with us and explain the basics of local culture souks taxi’s places to go and potentially to avoid. This was very personalised and helped us as first time visitors.    The super helpful staff in reception always greet you with a smile and went out of their way to help with any queries and will help book any half day/full day excursions hammams or even the professional tour guide. We booked our camel ride professional guide and hammam session through the hotel and everything went very smoothly. Your prices are communicated to you clearly and there is no confusion. The room we stayed in was very comfortable and spacious but we paid extra for a more spacious room and we recommend you check this with the hotel.    We would recommend the tour guide for everyone who is new to the city as it will at minimal give you an idea of where to go etc. Following the guidance provided we went on our ways finding our way around the old city and it was brilliant. Do go and explore for yourselves allow yourself to get lost around the souks as you will very quickly find your way around again. The evenings were absolutely buzzing in Jemaa el-Fnaa Square so do go and experience that also.    On our last day when we checked we was offered the option to go and put our feet-up and relax before our flight in the evening at their partner Riad hotel which is a 5 minute walk from Dar Anika as a complimentary gesture. Once again an amazing level of service and something we didn’t expect but were grateful for as it allowed us to relax and freshen up for our flight later that evening. We finally walked back to Dar Anika for our evening private transfer which was on-time and as professional as what we had become accustomed to.    If you are thinking of staying somewhere in Marrakech Morocco I would recommend you stay at Riad Dar Anika Marrakech. Its location is great easy access to local shops cafes restaurants and other amenities and all their staff are simply amazing.    I think the level of service and wonderful experience we received here will be very difficult to be matched elsewhere now 😊.    To the staff at this hotel you made our stay wonderful comfortable and one to remember. We can’t wait to visit again.    Thank you for everything.

Riad Dar Anika,Vacationer231772 wrote a review May 2022,50,Boutique Riad Dar Anika in Marrakech Morocco,This boutique hotel is beautiful quiet with great hospitality. Leanne us the General manager and she goes above and beyond to provide excellent service for the guests at this Riad. She us very kind. Personable and very helpful.  The hotel is lovely and very convenient to explore the old city. The employees are very friendly and helpful explaining how to get around the area. We were greeted upon our arrival with tea and cookies. Hind the receptionist explained in detail how to walk the area using a map. She also took our dinner order and made arrangements for a guide for the following day. She also made us a reservation for another restaurant in the Médina to go for dinner the next evening. The food from the kitchen was excellent very Moroccan fresh and delicious. The rooftop dining is fantastic at this hotel. In the afternoon they provide fresh watermelon juice and fresh made cakes.  All in all we would highly recommend this Riad and hope to come back again to enjoy this special hotel.

We cannot recommend Dar Anika highly enough. From the moment you are picked up at the Airport by Dar Anika's private transfers to the moment you are dropped off back at the Airport they take care of everything. Nothing is too much trouble. The Riad in itself is beautiful. We were in Room 1 which was beautifully spacious. The bed is huge!!! and I have the best nights' sleep I have had in a while.

The amazing staff are really what make this place so very special. From the moment we arrived we felt cared for and valued. We were greeted with smiles cold water delicious mint tea dates and milk and Moroccan cookies. Our room was simple and beautiful. Every time we returned to the riad after an outing we were offered water tea orange juice and cake. To say the customer service was exceptional doesn’t seem like an adequate description of the genuine human kindness shown by every staff member. They anticipated our every possible need and really made our experience in Marrakech very memorable. The day we left we had to leave early in the morning. As the gentleman at the front desk helped us with our luggage he handed me a bag and said “I packed you some sandwiches and fruit for your journey.” So sweet. So heartwarming.

Riad Dar Anika,Paul wrote a review May 2022,50,Highly recommended for 1st time visitors to Marrakech.,If you’re like us wanting to experience Marrakech for the very first time the choice & locations can be some what overwhelming. Let me make things super easy… the Riad Dar Anika is a wonderful option for 1st time visitors.    Stepping foot into the Riad you’ll be immediately whisked away from the nearby hustle & bustle of the local square into an incredible air of peace & tranquility. The welcome is particularly nice allowing you to rest your feet with the aromas of a mint tea before they highlight surrounding local things worth visiting.    Speaking of location you’re no more than 10 minutes walk to nearly all of the key attractions including the Souks. The small lane from the Riad to Souks is full of adventure & mystery although be mindful that motorbikes go anywhere in Marrakech so best to stay to one side at all times.    The Riad has a small swimming pool downstairs to cool off along with a roof terrace that includes a jacuzzi & sunbeds if you want to rest up. Breakfast mint tea & cake is all included best enjoyed on the terrace. The mountains provide a lovely backdrop of the nesting Storks if you’re lucky enough.    Couple of other notes.  - We paid 200 DHR for a taxi to Riad. With a bit more bartering I think you can get a fair bit cheaper. About 20 minute ride.    - Water & fruit are provided in the room.    - Walking around Marrakech is a rewarding experience so pack good shoes.    - Riad Monceau was a particularly fun dinner stop while you enjoy a bit of local jazz.    - The shop keepers & market traders are super friendly. Of course they encourage browsing their products but they are respectful if you’re not interested.    - The market square can be a little intense & busy so just be mindful of younger peeps & belongings. But it’s a great place to soak in local culture whilst grabbing a tea or coffee.    - 3-4 days is definitely about right to enjoy Marrakech at a steady pace.    Happy travelling and enjoy the delightful sights sounds & flavours of Marrakech.  recommended for 1st time visitors to Marrakech.,Date of stay: May 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pdidster

Riad Dar Anika,Stephenie L wrote a review Mar 2022,50,5-star Experience,When it comes to service what separates great from good is the attention to details. What Riad Dar Anika delivered was not just great—it was exceptional. From the decor to the food to the people zero complaints. But what really set them apart was the people. From the beginning when Leanne (I hope I’m spelling her name correctly) sat us down during check-in to go through the entire neighborhood recommending things to do and places to go to telling us anecdotes of her own experiences I immediately felt so welcomed that I already knew I was going to miss this place (and the people) when I check out. And her staff? Truly one of the best I’ve encountered in the service industry; courteous and professional yet also genuine and approachable. Additionally they remained communicative (basically around the clock) and were readily available for questions and recommendations reservations and last minute accommodations. They weren’t just willing to go the extra mile they went far and beyond.    In summary:    Location? ✅ Cleanliness? ✅ Comfort? ✅ Hospitality? ✅ Value? ✅    I would readily stay at Riad Dar Anika again if I return to Marrakech on a future visit and would not hesitate to recommend this establishment to anyone looking for a 5-star experience.,Date of stay: March 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"South San Francisco, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephenieli

We arrived at Dar Anika showed to our fabulous room with rose petals on the bed . The staff were wonderful arranged a gorgeous birthday cake for my husband and I as we were celebrating our birthdays. The Riad was in a perfect location a shop right outside the door in an alley that brought you straight in to the Medina. We really enjoyed the market although be careful at night guys going around with a snake and a monkey in a nappy if u take a photo they will demand money from you can be a bit overwhelming at first when they are all rushing to you to buy something you get use to it. I really enjoyed the souks and the Jewish quarter. We done two day trips an early start on one morning for sunrise in a hot air balloon the high light of my trip truly amazing they organised breakfast when we got down in a tent well worth the 6.30 start. We got a guide on second day Abdul from Marrakech Outdoors a family run business he spoke great English €120 for full day 10 to 7 in eve went to Atlas mountains and waterfall he organised a guide walker to bring us up the mountain (wear comfy runners a tough enough hike but we'll worth it) Abdul organised for us to dine up in mountain with a local family who welcomed us in to their home gave us a tour and cooked the most fabulous meal Marrakech style you really get a true feel for how simple they live on so little makes you appreciate what we have in life.

Everything from booking the room to organizing our airport pick up through to having a meal ready for us when we arrived late was just perfect and completely hassle free. The Riad along with others in the group is managed by Lyanne who clearly understands the correct concept of customer satisfaction as she organised everything for us and guided us really well in terms of what to see and where to eat. All her recommendations were spot on and her team were able to organise the guides and drivers for all our trips. They also made sure that we got very good value for money and this in itself was a great bonus for first time travelers to Marrakesh. We stayed in room number 2 which was a great size very comfortable really clean and fresh. We had a look whilst walking by at some of the other rooms which are similar in size and design so you wont be disappointed with any of them. We found all members of the team to be extremely helpful very warm and welcoming which added to the experience. If you want to see Marrakesh and immerse yourself to understand the culture pick this Riad as it was a truly wonderful experience and a great credit to Lyanne and her team. The location is one of the best within walking distance of everything so it makes things very easy to see.

Riad Dar Anika,Shazia M wrote a review Oct 2021,50,Hidden Gem in Marrakech,Dar Anika was phenomenal! It wasn’t just a place to stay it was an experience. Everyone there was so sweet and caring. They took such great care of us. My daughter and I decided to go to Morocco this past September for my birthday. After doing a lot of research we came upon Dar Anika. LyAnne and Hind were very helpful and accommodating. This was our first trip to Morocco and we didn’t what to expect. As soon as we arrived we knew we were safe and in good hands. The Riad is GORGEOUS! Very clean and well maintained. LyAnne and her staff are extremely friendly and treated us like family. We were taken to the lounge area and they washed our hands with rose water and a warm towel. Served us Moroccan mint tea cookies dates and milk. Took us upstairs to our room. The room was very clean and beautiful. Remember to take the drain plug out in the shower (lesson learned lol). We were served a delicious Moroccan breakfast every morning. Rasheed put together a beautiful spread. They also offer many different tours and spa services. The Hamman was such an amazing experience very relaxing. The Souks (my favorite part of the trip) were just around the corner. The Riad was close to EVERYTHING. Great restaurants shops banks you name it.    I can’t put into words the great experience we had in Marrakech. Ms. LyAnne was like a mother to us. I still remember how she watched us drive off every time we left the Riad. She truly cares. I definitely recommend staying here.    Thank you Ms. LyAnne!

Riad Dar Anika,Gib wrote a review Feb 2021,50,In the lap of luxury,This was my first trip to Morocco and Marrakech was high on my list of city destinations. The middle of a pandemic was an interesting time to visit and I probably saw the city at its quietest but it meant that I had the beautiful boutique Dar Anika hotel pretty much to myself.    The hotel is perfectly situated right at the entrance to the Medina and an inauspicious entrance makes way to a hidden gem of a palace inside complete with heated pool atrium with plants galore and all the traditional furniture to give it an authentic feel. The hotel has been managed by the very friendly and capable Lyanne from New Zealand supported by a marvellous team of dedicated and responsive local staff who couldn't have been nicer. Nothing was too much trouble and from the perfectly made coffees from Hassan over breakfast on the sun terrace through to the hammam scrub at night the service was really first class.    For anyone looking for a city getaway I couldn't recommend Dar Anika more highly. It's your own little luxurious sanctuary tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the souks.

The Jama El f'na market is 700 metre's away whilst the El Badii Palace with its roosting storks is a mere 300 metres.    Inside is a sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of the local street traders as you walk through the door you're hit with the sweet perfume that instantly tells you you're in the heart of Morocco.    As you pass reception the beauty of the hotel is revealed a bright atrium with a small pool on the ground floor the light reflects from the pool. you can take moroccan tea by the poolside or in the sitting room with its large sofa's. The rooms are generous and the bed was very comfortable! The rooms have all the amenities required safe hairdryer and toiletries. The vanilla shampoo is a delight.    On the top floor is the restaurant and a sun deck. The food was delicious the menu is not extensive but is more than sufficient for a weeks stay. You must try the moroccan wine the ones I tried were delightful.    The best assets of the hotel are the staff it was the most excellent welcome and we were treated with the highest regard during our stay. We we there when the borders were closed and the expectation of having to stay in Morocco became very real. The staff gave us every assistance and advice we had our flight cancelled the day before we were due to fly and were assisted in rearranging transfers to the airport and printing new boarding cards.

Riad Dar Anika,TraderJD wrote a review Feb 2020,50,Wonderful Experience,Our stay pleasant and worry free. Beautiful Riad with top notch service with attention to details. Leanne the property manager was present at our arrival to personally greet us and was also there to see us off four days later. She and her staff helped plan out daily trips to destinations nearby without pressure rush or need for advance deposit. Riad is located at southern end of Medina so it was peaceful at night yet short easy walk to the souks and the square. Daily breakfast in the terrace was very enjoyable. The best dinner we had in Marrakesh during our 4 day stay was at this Riad.

The staff goes far out of their way to ensure that your stay runs smoothly. The entire hotel is spectacular and the attention to detail again testament to the dedicated staff is just spectacular. Their hospitality and their dedication to making sure that your stay (including various efforts to tailor your trip ... like setting up tours dinners and other arrangements) is clearly what makes the Dar Anika special.

Riad Dar Anika,Philip A wrote a review Feb 2020,50,"Great Dar, ebjoyed the inner pool",We stumbled across the website for Dar Anika whilst looking for a riad in which to stay and were drawn by the peace and quiet that this riad promised. We were slightly reticent about booking as the property was new and had no online reviews although it is obviously being marketed as an upmarket riad as it appears on several other websites. The British ownership however put our minds at ease.    It is situated in a prime position close to several attractions (including the open top Marrakech Tour bus stop – although this is an eyesore not an attraction!) and is accessible by road. It is also at the start (or end) of a busy footpath that takes you straight to the Jemma El Fna (approx 10 minutes); mind the mopeds! In contrast to the noise and commotion in the street it is a place of peace and calm once you step through the heavy front door.    The service is impeccable with discreet and attentive service. This is a result I’m sure of the high levels of professionalism with which the British manager runs the place.    The room price included a healthy breakfast of fruit yoghurt and a variety of local breads. We also opted for the evening meal which to my mind included some of the best Moroccan food I have ever tasted! I particularly liked the beef tajine with almonds and prunes (had it twice). This British run riad prides itself on meals that are prepared hygienically and to very high standards.    As is the nature of riads the bedrooms are quite dark and even with all the lights on we found it a struggle to read. We did have a small patio area however that was outside (not suitable to sun bathe due to high walls) and pleasant to sit in.    A note of caution. For most North Europeans July and August is far too hot. For several days during our stay the temperature was in the low to mid forties with occasional sand-filled thunderstorms (see picture - this is desert country). If you have been to Marrakech before and just want to relax by the pool it is fine but if it is your first time temperatures like this sap your energy and make casual sightseeing very uncomfortable,Date of stay: July 2019,,"Rozelle, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philipaA6822VF

We received a warm welcome from Leanne who in ten minutes gave us more helpful information about navigating Marrakech and the Medina than we had received in the prior two days. The location is perfect - easily accessible by car but in the Medina. The rooms are immaculate and the service staff is friendly polite and efficient. The real highlight is the rooftop restaurant/bar where you feel instantly transported within (but above!) the fray of the Medina.

Riad Dar Anika,Thomas H wrote a review Jan 2020,50,A wonderful stay!,We have not written many reviews here or elsewhere but our stay at Riad Dar Anika was so enjoyable we wanted to let them know. The staff and manager were so responsive! They helped us make a few plans before we arrived and they checked in with us every day to see what we needed. The location was ideal. Just outside the Medina it is both steps away from taxis and just a short straight walk to the main square inside the Medina. We enjoyed a nice dinner at the Riad the night we arrived hammam and massage the next day and they arranged a trip to the Atlas Mountains for us as well. That was another wonderful day as we were met by Hassan a guide they often use who led us on a leisurely and enjoyable 2 hour walk around the valley.

Riad Dar Anika,MKPortillo wrote a review Jan 2020,50,Unbeatable Service & Location,My girlfriend and I spent our vacation in Marrakech at the Dar Anika and we could not be happier. From the moment we left the US to the moment we returned the Dar Anika was in constant contact with us to ensure the quality of our trip. The Riad is located in the old city right outside of the entrance to the markets. Market shopping and street food as well as beauty stores and upscale restraints were just minutes away by foot. Taxi’s are plentiful which kept them reasonably priced.    By far the best part of our stay was the staff & service. Breakfast and room service never disappointed. The front desk made reservations at restaurants (useful if you don’t speak French/Arabic). The cleaning staff tidied our room & bathroom 3 times a day. Finally the manager Lyanne gave invaluable advice & service. When I needed something from the store Lyanne walked me from the Riad all the way to the area of the store where my item was. That’s just the quality of service she offered.    The Riad Dar Anika is a world class establishment with unbeatable service.

They also helped us plan our day activities with a tour guide for the city tour and also where exactly to go eat tips for the tourists and watch outs etc..This was one of the most memorable trip of our life and it was all because of Lyann and her incredible staff!!! There were 3 incredible receptionist genies as I would call them as they were so sweet and friendly and they made all our wishes of having great time come true !!! We absolutely put all the faith on them to plan it for us and it was the best decision. The location of the riad was also perfect as it was just right at the entrance and you don’t have to walk a lot from the car stop unlike other riads that are inside and you have to walk all the way with the suitcases to get into.  The rooms are very clean and good. Honestly the rooms did not matter so much because we were just outside all day and only came back to sleep..

Lyanne took a genuine interest in our family. Her tips were so helpful and she just made us feel so welcome and at home. We stayed here during New Years Eve and had a fantastic NYE dinner at their rooftop restaurant with wonderful food and the staff really went out of their way to make sure we had a fun time.    When we first arrived we were flustered because our driver had dropped us at the wrong place and a local had taken us to the wrong Riad and had argued with us very rudely for a bigger tip. The front desk ladies took it upon themselves to deal with the local and even went so far to call the tour company to remedy the situation. This exemplifies this Riad they go above and beyond to make this experience an overwhelmingly positive one. These women always had a smile on their face and made us always feel welcome and accommodated.    On top of that the Riad was absolutely beautiful and the rooftop views are breathtaking.

There was a great welcome and any time in the day when she saw us coming or going she will be out offering us teas and juices and cookies and cakes. Her hospitality was truly incredible. When we informed her that my daughter has nut allergy she called the cook to verify if there Calle selections that day had any nuts. She also told the cook not to make anything with nuts over the next 3 days so we can eat everything without worrying.    The staff is very efficient and friendly. The place is very organized. They gave us two local phones with addresses and phone preprogrammed. We could call them anytime day or night if we were lost in the Medina or just needed anything.

Riad Dar Anika,Mysticv wrote a review Dec 2019,40,"Different, but a special experience 👍🏻",I spent 3 nights here at the beginning of december and was mostly very satisfied ! It started already at the check-in I was allowed to take a seat on the sofa got tea and a dessert. Wow I was really positively surprised! Also a free telephone was made available I found a very nice gesture.    To the rooms which were very traditionally furnished.. actually very beautiful but some things were missing to me. A little more modern would have done well for example there was no TV in the room. Also the minibar was empty when opening. the bathroom did not correspond to a 5 star hotel for me shower was for example integrated in the bathtub and not individually... the shampoo was not very effective and the washbasin rather old.  Also a negative point for me was the size of the room namely it was quite small for this price which I paid.    But the breakfast and the roof terrace were beautiful. I also appreciated the friendliness of the staff...    I find the ratings a little too high here and for me rather a 4 star hotel. But all in all I was very satisfied it was a completely different experience for me. it is just different than staying in a five star hotel in Europe but I still felt very comfortable here around the clock.    What I also found beautiful... at the check out I got another present and eat for my flight. Very attentive and hospitable is this hotel ! Many other hotels could cut themselves a slice of this.

Riad Dar Anika,Kev M wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Wow what a place,I don't tend to review many places but 5his one needs to recognised as an amazing place. The locations is perfectly placed in the old town with easy access to the famous squares souks and Mosque's.  The room was a superior room and was lovely. Only one word of caution is if you suffer from claustrophobia then ask about what room has the most natural light. This is something that all Riad's would have as they have small windows. We loved the room though. The bed was big and comfy. The breakfast was varied and truly Morrocan which was great but if you wanted western style food there were breads and omlettes as well.  We ate in the restaurant twice and the food was stunning.  The main positive about is was the service from pick at the airport to check in briefing and maps offers to do reservations at restaurants use of their driver and buying entry tickets to lending you a local smartphone with preset numbers to call the hotel and use Google maps. Simply everything was a pleasure (especially the bar manager making us speciality cocktails to try). We felt truly welcome and would absolutely recommend friends to stay here when in Marrakesh,Date of stay: December 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Eastleigh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/68kevm

Riad Dar Anika,Anne W wrote a review Nov 2019,40,Warm welcome and traditional charm,I was welcomed with fresh dates and mint tea in one of the lovely reception rooms. The local staff were attentive and efficient and manager Leeanne a font of practical advice and ready help in any contingency. Older less fit folks might not relish the stairs climb to where the food is but it's good for the appetite. Loved the view from the rooftop and the warm quiet ambience of the dining-room which included a man playing the oud a traditional lute. Much better than piped music. Despite my room being on the ground floor off the central courtyard it was sufficiently noiseproof that I was able to sleep undisturbed a pleasant outcome for this light sleeper. Note there is no kettle but tea or coffee or hot water will be brought to you virtually on demand. I had a very early flight on the day of my departure and relished the fresh hot pot of tea brought to me as I waited for my airport transfer at 3.30am.,Date of stay: November 2019,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Hobart, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annewarburton4

Enjoy an incredible stay,I do all the holiday planning in my house so when my husband came home and suggested Dar Anika as his colleague had been there and said it was incredible I looked it up on here. Surely all those glowing reviews couldn’t be true...? Well we’ve just returned and I can say with confidence they are true. Lyanne and her team throughly spoil you from the breakfast feast each morning to making sure you know where to go and what to visit. The trip is a delight from beginning to end. We only stayed for 3 nights but loved every minute of staying here. Our suite had a stunning cupola in the roof- we slept so well. Riads don’t have big picture windows due to their design. It’s not an issue - we had the best nights sleep ever. The toiletries are stunning they have decent Parlux hairdryers in the rooms and comfy pillow top mattresses. We had dinner one night in the hotel and enjoyed that. Afternoon tea was delicious each day. There were so many little touches dates and almond milk in our room a lunch box and toiletries to take home etc. We loved it here.,Date of stay: November 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Chesham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cocotwice

The room was just what the internet said it was. Breakfast was great. The restaurant which is part of the RIAD was outstanding. All service was just excellent. The place was quiet from 10PM to 5AM. Yes we heard the call for prayer at 6AM. But everyone does who stays in this part of town. My only comment was the insulation in the room was not perfect.

Lyanne makes it easy to enjoy the Médina. The briefing when you arrive the welcome at breakfast and when you come back from the mornings adventure and drinks on the terrace.

Chicken Saffra which was chicken and couscous mixed with herbs and spices in a sauce. SO tasty.    Ordered pears in caramel sauce for desert and again was so delicious. Really really lovely food.

Riad Dar Anika,Curious661629 wrote a review Oct 2019,50,30th Wedding Anniversary memories to cherish,Nothing was too much for the charming and respectful team. Always a smile and a courteous manner. Leanne was a terrific host with encyclopedic knowledge of her surroundings. Warm and friendly quick-witted efficient and most amusing! She devoted time to her guests. What an asset to Dar Anika.  Arrangements were made seamlessly for our 4 day stay. We went to La Bahia Palace Le Jardin Secret Maison de la Photographie the Marjorelle Garden (and the Yves st Lauren Museum) and the Musee de le Femme. All worth a visit. We also jostled between fellow tourists traders and scooters in the endless souks. Beware of taking photos in the Jemaa-El-Fna Square.  Essaouira was a delight as was Hakim our driver. He was justifiably proud of his Berber heritage. A guide showed us the old town.  The food was excellent and a great lively evening out is at Comptoir Darna with belly-dancing.  A hammam (massage - deep clean!) is a must arranged at the Riad.  We thoroughly enjoyed our time but it is hectic outside and a bit exhaust-fumey. We went in October and the weather was lovely. High summer could be overwhelming for some brits!  We loved our time there and it has a special place in our hearts. A surprise anniversary cake a packed lunch for our journey home and of course Leanne's trademark rose petals in the rooms were all those little added touches which can make such a difference to your feeling of being looked after and treated as special.

Riad Dar Anika,Jabba wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Fabulous stay in a well appointed Riaad inan ideal location with exemplary service.,I booked the Riad Dar Anika for my wife and I after coming to Morocco in June on a boys trip when we stayed at a fairly bland but very adequate international chain.  If you want a real taste of Medina living then this is the place. Beautifully appointed at an entrance to the Souk two minutes from the Bahia Palace and 5 minutes from the Jamaa El Fna. The Riad is an oasis of calm from the hustle and bustle of the Souk which is well needed.  The hotel is furnished to a high standard with a nice bar and roof top restaurant and a typical small pool to one side of the quadrangle. Our superior room was authentic with a standard double and a bath and shower. Riad rooms arem't typically enormous given their heritage. If you want something large go to one of the chain hotels outside the Medina. By the way if you cant handle stairs (not a problem to my wife or I) then look somewhere else  The staff staff were extremely good. I received a personalised welcome email before I came and they arranged transfers (20mins from the airport) and a number of restaurant bookings etc before we came. Having arrived off the hideously early flight from London Gatwick we were fed and watered and made to feel at home. The Kiwi Manageress was extremely good We had a twenty five minute sit down with her during which she took us through Medina logistics and ideas of places to go and restaurants worth a visit. She does this with all of the guests.  We dined at the rooftop restaurant on the first evening given our early start. The shoulder of lamb for two was excellent and was the local Shiraz. You also have breakfast in the restaurant. Depending on your appetite talk to the waiter before you order as although excellent it is a multi course affair! Cake and drinks are also available in the Courtyard during the afternoon should it take your fancy.  On checking out we were given a transparent package containing a hand baggage sized shower gel shampoo and soap as a leaving gift together with a 'security friendly lunch bag with a sandwich and fruit; a really nice touch.  The true test of staying in a hotel is whether you would stay there again. In the case of Riad Dar Anika a resounding yes!,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeremy_baldwin007

The restaurant has a good reputation and the menu looked really high quality although we unfortunately didn't get the chance to eat there ourselves. The riad is located close to the main square and all the market stalls but also near many popular tourist attractions. The roof terrace was a perfect way to end a day of sightseeing and then again at the end of the day before going to bed. It was our daughter's birthday during our stay and the hotel staff couldn't do enough - they organised a cake and flowers for her which really made her trip. On departure we were given gifts including toiletries and a print of our names in Arabic as a memento of our time there given a goodbye hug from the hotel manager and taken to a nearby taxi.

From the moment of arrival to that of final departure we were treated as honoured welcome guests. The director and her staff were marvellously friendly and helpful giving us advice and recommendations whenever we sought them obtaining tickets and reservations for us booking a city tour and a wonderful guided tour and hike in the Atlas Mountains and there to chat with us about our experiences over cups of mint tea and luscious local home-made pastries when we returned from our outings. Our corner room 3 on the upper terrace level was spacious beautifully decorated quiet and calm and kept spotless. Our included breakfasts were so copious and delicious that we skipped lunch entirely on our days in the city. For me this small luxury riad is far superior to the big grand hotels in Marrakech.

Leanne spent time at breakfast giving us some handy tips before we explored the Souks and we were given a local mobile phone to use for the duration of our stay so that we could call them directly if we got lost.  The roof top terrace with a cocktail is a must in the late afternoon as is the restaurant on an evening in a beautiful setting.

Riad Dar Anika,viajeespiral wrote a review Sep 2019,50,Best Riad in Marrakech!!!,Dar Anika went above and beyond our expectations. Starting with their amazing staff every employee gave 110% to make us feel at home and were always attentive to every single detail. Everyone was so helpful and willing to accommodate to our needs. Upon arrival the concierge gave us a tour of the property sat with us in the lounge to answer questions and helped us organize our agenda. We were provided with a local cellphone to use during our stay and our warm welcome was completed with peppermint tea and homemade cookies (that are always available in the courtyard for the guests). We booked all our tours and activities through the Riad and they didn’t disappoint. Riad location was exceptional very centric and close to almost everything in the Medina so it was easy to come and go. The room was very clean and comfortable. The rooftop restaurant was a must for breakfast every morning as well as for dinner. Nights were spent relaxing in the rooftop terrace under the stars. Definitely would recommend if staying in Marrakech. Thank you very much to Hint Lyanne and everyone that helped us have a honeymoon to remember.

Riad Dar Anika,Amwbon wrote a review Sep 2019,50,Lovely stay in Marrakech,This is a lovely riad located in the old city of Marrakech. The location is easy to get to as it's a very short walk from the old Jewish quarter where taxis can drop you. Yet it's located within the souk close to the main square. The riad itself is beautiful and the rooms are comfortable. Leanne and her team welcomed us like family and made sure every need was met. We had dinner in the rooftop restaurant one night which was one of the best meals of our Morocco adventure - including being serenaded with lovely traditional music. We'll happily recommend Dar Anika!,Date of stay: September 2019,,"Sharon, Massachusetts",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amwbon
Riad Dar Anika,Sarah R wrote a review Sep 2019,50,Best of the best,My husband and I truly don’t have enough nice words to use about this wonderful place. The amenities location food ambiance rooms decor etc were all top notch but what made the stay really special was the staff. They are the warmest kindest most lovely people. Lyanne is fabulous and her love for the staff and guests shines through. All of her recommendations were spot on and really helped us to make the most of our stay. If traveling to Marrakech you must stay here. You are right at the action of the market and you are able to walk all over the Medina from the Riad. You are also right near a taxi stand so access to the other parts of town is also very easy. The Riad itself is peaceful and pleasant despite the busy streets below. We enjoyed spending our evenings on the terrace upstairs. Truly the best place we believe we’ve ever had the pleasure of staying.,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Huntsville, Alabama",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahrG6494XJ

The service and hospitality were terrific. There is a rooftop restaurant that is a great place to relax and have a drink. The food was excellent. Rooms were nice and the hotel was very clean. The only limitation of the place is that the pool is too small to really swim laps but it was clean and will cool you off.,Date of stay: October 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/berktheo

From the moment we walked in we were graciously and enthusiastically supported and helped and made to feel at home. The Riad was beautiful and comfortable. The small swimming/wading pool was incredibly refreshing after the hot sun of Marrakesh. The room was excellent (though the lights flickered on occasion)... we had a Superior Double Room so we had plenty of space. They helped arrange everything we needed - the service was exceptional at all times. In all ways a wonderful experience.,Date of stay: September 2019,,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesbenderjr

Riad Dar Anika,Impactdancer wrote a review Aug 2019,50,Exceptional Stay Amazing Service,We’ve just returned from the most amazing 3 nights at Riad Dar Anika and we cannot emphasise how fantastic this Riad is. The manager Lyanne offers personal service that easily rivals if not surpasses that of some 5 star hotels we’ve stayed in. The location is fantastic and as soon as you step out on to the street you really feel you are in the centre of everything.    Within hours of booking the staff emailed to make contact and answered any questions within a very short time. Communication was excellent and it was refreshing not to have to chase a hotel for a reply.    From the moment we arrived we were delighted by the attention to detail and the efficiency of Lyanne’s team. After drinks and a guided tour of Riad Dar Anika by Lyanne we were shown to our rooms which are beautiful and have such an authentic feel to them a much better way to experience Marrakech than a boring big chain hotel.    We were given the use of a phone in case we needed google maps or to contact the hotel a map which marked out where everything was in relation to the Riad and a friendly reminder to call if we needed anything.    Dinner at the Riad was superb a great wine selection and we had arranged a cake for our friend’s birthday which was taken care of and delivered to the table just as we asked.    The rooms are serviced well fresh towels twice a day if you want gorgeous complimentary products plenty of complimentary bottled water and some seriously good cake in the afternoons served in the lounge. Breakfast is like a banquet there is absolutely no way you can leave hungry.    Even as we checked out the service was spot on with some amazing little touches that left us feeling that we really had struck gold. Riad Dar Anika really made our holiday in Marrakech for us and we would highly recommend you booking your stay here. It really is an exceptional place and once again thank you to Lyanne and her team for everything,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Kent,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Impactdancer

Riad Dar Anika,Jessica C wrote a review Aug 2019,50,You don't need to look further,The trip was absolutely amazing a great part thank to Riad Dar Anika. We had a wonderful time besides the horrible flight experience. Staff was so friendly everything so detailed we even received lovely sandwiches for our return airport ride from the Manager. Unfortunately we lost 2 days due to traveling issues and did not get our money back which simply sucks BUT the experience made it worth it.    The food is great! Very delicious not once did it make me sick and that is coming from a person that has plenty of stomach issues. The restaurant manager was delightful very attentive and kind.    Distance form the medina: its a 5-8 min straight walk. I repeat Straight walk!! With so many left rights and forks in the road you learn to appreciate a straight walk.    Room: Clean.. clean and clean. We did notice some little ants made their way inside the first night but as you can see there is an open space and many natural plants everywhere After the first night we never saw them again. The staff ALWAYS cleaned so detailed they even organized my whitening strips in the bathroom!    Tours: I had in mind what tours I wanted to do before I arrived. They offered to schedule everything for us and was later added to our tab. Honestly that was the best choice we made! We visited the Jardin and YSL museums and went for a camel ride suring sunset. It takes the pressure off looking for taxis tickets and etc. They also tell you the limit of how much taxis should cost so you do not get ripped off!    Lastly I would recommend to enjoy the pool. During our stay we seemed to be the only people making use of it. It is beautiful romantic and quit peaceful from the madness 50 feet away.    -Riad Kaiss ( sister riad) They have a sister Riad where you can have breakfast lunch and dinner. You can also use the pool at this location. It is a 3 minute walk away but do not worry they will escort you there so you will not get lost.    We loved this place so much!

Upon our arrival we were immediately calmed by Lyanne and her amazing advice on everything - where to eat how to get reservations how to exchange cash places to see. We were also given a phone to use which was instrumental!    The location is AMAZING right between the main taxi queue and the medina. Lyanna also helped us negotiate the right rate to get to la jardine majorelle.    The food is awesome - I can't believe breakfast was included - it is a beautiful mountainous spread of delicious breads spreads and delicacies.    The staff is incredible - so helpful kind thoughtful. We were always greeted with kindness and given everything we needed plus more.    The room was well air conditioned comfortable bed perfect blackout blinds and incredibly quiet. We were nervous we'd be awakened by the 6a call to prayer and never did it disturb our sleep.    Just when we thought we had it all we were sent off with beautiful gifts and a delicious lunch to go. Seriously amazing and so thoughtful.    We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay and highly recommend to our friends.

Riad Dar Anika,MinnesotaPat wrote a review Jul 2019,50,The Best Place!,This is absolutely the best place! I was in Marrakech about 10 years ago and I desperately tried to find the Riad I stayed at 10 years ago. Fortunately I couldn't find the prior Riad and we stayed at Riad Dar Anika.    The location is excellent the grounds are beautiful and the management and staff are the best. You are a short walk to the main square where you can find the chaos that is Marrakech. But then you can return to Riad Dar Anika and find peace and relaxation.

They took care of everything including arranging a hiking trip to the Atlas mountains airport pickup and return restaurant recommendations and reservations drivers and taxis shopping advice etc. Lyanne guided me in getting a terrific deal on a quality carpet to bring home. Upon returning from an outing we were always greeted with a refreshing drink. The restaurant was outstanding (we ate dinner there twice) and the rooftop bar gave a spectacular view of the city as the sun went down. The entire facility was clean quiet and relaxing.

Breakfast dinner and drinks on the roof top terrace were particularly pleasant especially after a busy day in the city. The hospitality was nothing short of outstanding - they made us feel as though we were at home! The location could not have been better -- this Riad is within 10 meters of a busy street where a taxi can be hailed - a short 5-10 minute walk in the opposite direction and we were in the heart of the Jemaa market. 6 stars if that was an option!,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled on business,"San Antonio, Texas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cpatrick54

Riad Dar Anika,DavidDC wrote a review Jun 2019,50,"Friendly, well located Riad, great find.",The hospitality at this Riad begins right after you book and extends past the time you leave. Simply put staying here enhances your visit to Marrakech rather than merely a great place to stay. The staff is unobtrusively warm. They provide advice assistance and guidance that are designed to help you enjoy your stay. There are many places where that type of service is designed to simply sell you something. Not so here. I received great advice about where to eat how to negotiate and practical advice on how to enjoy myself in an environment that is quite different than my own. The Riad itself is clean rooms well put together and facilities reflect their unique environment. The food is good and provides a great value for money.

Riad Dar Anika,Tangata haere wrote a review Jun 2019,50,Phew – Peace at last,After a hectic time travelling around Morocco in a tour group our last stop was Marrakesh. It was a pleasure to stumble across this haven just by the square at Bab Mellah. Attracted by the Anika’s Kitchen sign we went in to be warmly greeted by none other than a fellow kiwi (New Zealander) Lyanne. It was such a breath of fresh air! All her staff were exceptional. They guided us to the rooftop where we has some snacks and cool drinks. We were so impressed that we booked dinner for that evening {and took along with us some other members of our tour}. The monk fish was “to die for” and the caramelised pears were worth a return visit. Lyanne was a kind and thoughtful host. They made us feel special at a time when we were tired and over travelling.

Whilst the restaurant was quite empty when we arrived the atmosphere was lovely with live music and plants everywhere.    We ordered the chicken with vermicelli and beef fillet brochette. We were given warm bread and sauces (aubergine olive and cream cheese) as a complimentary appetiser which was really tasty. The main courses were faultless which we paired with the house white wine (reasonably priced) and followed with a mint tea (which came with small biscuits/pastries).    Overall the food was wonderful and some of the best we have eaten in Marrakech. Whilst not the cheapest (700 DH for the total bill) it was well worth it.

This place blew me away and I will return to Morocco some day just to go back to this Riad. They welcome you here with all the tiny details which I happen to notice. They cleansed out hands with rose water upon entry checked us in with mint tea and cookies a bowl of fresh fruit in a comfortable air conditioned lounge. Then the gorgeous Riad itself welcomes you with flowers and decor the room was special because we were upgraded to a suite. The next morning I wasn't quite ready for breakfast and no joke was joyously greeting by the bartender with a coffee with fresh steamed milk and when I ordered two orange juices for my daughters to bring back to the room he hand squeezed fresh oranges and the server carried them back for me on a tray. 5 star service all around. Finally I'm not a big foodie but the breakfast later that morning blew us away just delicious. These Moroccon bread thingies with honey and fruit salad and homemade yogurt more fresh juice cakes coffees teas you name it if they could fit it on the table up on the veranda overlooking Marrakesh they did.

The manager was very friendly and gave us advice choosing the correct diner.  Than the food itself. It was just amazing. Quality was as high as it can get in Marrakesh I would say the best in town.

Riad Dar Anika,Genussmensch wrote a review May 2019,50,A home abroad perfectly situated,We just spend a couple of days in this lovely Riad. Lian and her team have been very welcoming and were helping us with everything we were looking for. The rooms are nicely decorated and clean. It's close to the central place (Djemaa el Fna) and the Bahia Palace. The rooftop bar is the place to relax after you spend a day in the Souk or you sign up for the Hammam at the Riad. We enjoyed dining at the Dar Anika Restaurant on the top floor. Nice variety of Moroccan and Italian dishes ( the chef is an Italian) that we enjoyed very much. Lian is clearly the soul of the place in her welcoming and warmhearted style.

From the rose strewn beds to the afternoon tea we were truly pampered. The riad itself is a beautiful light filled place with marble floors and birds flitting in from the open ceiling. The restaurant on the third floor is exceptional (worth a visit even if you are not staying at the hotel) and the staff is extremely helpful including packing sandwiches for us for the plane ride. There is also a private terrace at the very top of the building where you can have a drink or catch a bit of sun.

Riad Dar Anika,Holly V wrote a review Apr 2019,50,Best service in the world!,Dar Anika is undoubtedly the best hotel that we’ve ever stayed in. Their service is out of this world. I was treated like a queen while staying here. The staff is so friendly hospitable and accommodating. Upon checking in you are welcomed with tea dates milk and cookies. Everyday when we got back to our room we were then greeted with frozen drinks and cake. When checking out they gave us gifts and packed a lunch for us to eat on the plane (which was exactly what we needed). I’ve never witnessed a hotel offer this kind of service before. I loved that they gave us a cell phone to use to call them if lost or to arrange a ride. Made me feel much safer and more comfortable while exploring a new city. We arranged several rides with them and it made our time there much easier. The rooftop is beautiful and the food was the best food we got in all of Marrakech. You have to try their brioutes - they’re amazing! The all-included breakfast was like a seven course meal with endless deliciousness. The pool was great and relaxing. We spent a bit more than we usually do to stay at Dar Anika and we are so glad that we did. It’s so worth the money and next time we go back to Marrakech we won’t even think about staying anywhere else.

Riad Dar Anika,Steve wrote a review Apr 2019,50,Outstanding hospitality,I can honestly say that of all the places we have travelled to around the world the hospitality and warmth of welcome we experienced at Riad Dar Anika was second to none. We stayed for 4 nights in March to celebrate my wife's 50th birthday and Lyanne and the team made it so special.    Even before our arrival communication was swift and very helpful arranging an airport transfer and for our room to be decorated for the birthday celebrations.    The briefing Lyanne gave us along with the local mobile phone with Google maps in case we got lost allowed us to have the confidence to explore this beautiful city whilst being aware of the areas to avoid and the scams to be on guard for.    The Riad itself is perfectly located just outsidethe medina - whether travelling on foot or via taxi with lots to explore within a short walk from the doorstep. As you can also see from the many photos on here it's beautifully decorated and with a rooftop terrace where you can find some peace and tranquility.    The food in the restaurant was excellent we enjoyed the traditional Moroccan breakfast but also had dinner a couple of times. The bar had not yet been finished during our stay but looked almost ready to open and am sure it would be lovely.    We also treated ourselves to a couples Hammam and massage both of which were excellent but the lady who gave us the Hammam was especially lovely.    Every single member of staff was excellent and really helped to make my wife's birthday celebrations special (including a gorgeous cake).    At checkout we were given a packed lunch for the journey home (which was delicious) and a small poster print with our names written in Arabic as a souvenir. Again lovely thoughtful touches that demonstrate the attention to detail Lyanne and the team offer.

The staff is highly competent attentive gracious and kind. Whether working with the staff to plan outings in Marrakech and its environs or simply relaxing on the terrace with a drink or enjoying a quiet tasty meal Riad Dar Anika proved a wonderful haven and well-situated home base in the Médina. We have traveled a good deal and cannot recall a single hotel with better people. The staff is an invaluable resource in terms of detailed advice and counsel on navigating Marrakech and the local culture and economy; providing a network of prompt polite and trustworthy local guides and drivers; and most of all a willingness to tailor our experience to our unique interests and desires. Highlights included savory Moroccan breakfasts afternoons out on the terrace with mint tea or a cold beer and always finding a bowl of fresh fruit and a plate of biscuits in the room. The rooms are small and windowless as is common inside the Médina. That said the garden atrium is open sunny and comfortable and you have other choices within the riad with a couple quiet indoor lounges tabes chairs couches on the first and second floor atriums and two small rooftop terraces from which to watch the bustle on the streets below. Finally Dar Anika is within a 10-minute walk from Katoubia Mosque Jemaa el Fna the souks the Kasbah and other key sites.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sunshine42340030634

I did not see the luxury that one usually expects when pays that much for a hotel room. However the real luxury of DAR ANIKA comes in the service in the people in the staff in the way they care about the guests. You really feel protected and embraced in that crazy Marrakech. There I felt like home. It is true that the rooms are not that large and does not have that luxury of Ritz Carlton but beds are super comfortable and there are so much other details that the Ritz does not has and that DAR ANIKA has. Everything is so cozy. Food is amazing. It is one of the few Riads that you can reach by taxi which is another luxury. I strong recommend this Riad.

Lyanne (a very caring knowledgeable and clever lady)and her team couldn't do enough for us from arranging the transport from the airport sharing information on a map about where to go in Marrakech organising a guide for the first morning arranging a taxi to our next stop in the Atlas mountains the endless supply of mint tea to the completion of the forms for the airport and the food for our trip to our next destination. They really went over and above.    The rooms were clean and spacious the property is a cool and peaceful retreat from the madness of the streets of the Medina. It is conveniently located for the souks and main square and very easy to get to by taxi - some of the Riads are quite a walk from the nearest road and although some offer to cart your luggage to the Riad we had the luxury of being met from our taxi by Riad staff and being inside the Riad moments later.    As per a previous review we much preferred the Riad experience to the luxury large hotel. La Mamounia (which is just up the road) is lovely but quite sterile and clinical. At Riad Dar Anika you feel like you're in Morocco and because there are only 12 rooms the staff are attentive without being intrusive. It's unique and the personal touch makes this Riad stand out.

Perfectly located within the medina it’s the ideal location to explore this fascinating city. Managed by the wonderful Lyanne the staff of the Riad take care of all your needs. From the welcome drink and tour around the facilities to the rose petals beautifully arranged in the bedroom and the loan of a mobile phone to call for a pick-up should your sense of direction go astray in the labyrinth of souks.    Lyanne’s tips for navigating the city and her concern for guests’ well-being are both outstanding. The rooms are beautiful the breakfast a true Moroccan feast and the rooftop terraces a delight to escape the hustle and bustle - the perfect place to enjoy a book or the views across the city to the distant Atlas Mountains.

The interior Moroccan courtyard is graced with beautiful tile floors trellised roses high quality Moroccan furnishings and a welcoming warmth. The manager is usually nearby graciously helping with advice even walking Susan to a cash machine when are usual one was not working. Staff were consistently gracious and helpful. A quality breakfast was included in the upper floor restaurant overlooking the courtyard with other views over the medina.    This oasis was especially valued as the narrow ways of the medina full of pedestrians are constantly disrupted by motor skooters some respectful of pedestrians some not. All the more reason to value this lovely tranquille hotel situated within walking distance of major monuments and the fine textile museum in the medina.

In fact it is so beautiful and comfortable that we spent almost as much time relaxing in the riad as we spent sightseeing! The rooftop bar-restaurant offers an amazing breakfast (orange juice eggs Moroccan crepes and breads fruit yogurt coffee cake and tea or coffee) and when we returned to the riad late afternoons we were offered tea and cake in the courtyard.

Riad Dar Anika,Dee wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Beautiful Dar Anika,Our 3 days stay here was fabulous we were well looked after from our arrival.A friendly porter was waiting to help us with our bags to the Dar. Lyanne and her staff welcomed us with genuine warmth. The rooms are clean and its evident that the hygiene standard is very high. All the staff in the Dar are warm and ever willing to help and assist us. We were given a mobile phone Incase we got lost a very thoughtful and smart guesture. We HIGHLY recommend this wonderful piece of heaven in Marrakech for those looking for a home away from home. we could not fault the hotel in any way as everything was perfect. Little gestures like in room fresh fruit n cookies serving coffee n cake after a tour ice crushed fruit whn it’s warm milk n dates at night. Infact we kept comparing all the other places we stayed at to Dar Anika’s high standard of hospitality and efficiency.,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hong Kong, China",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MooreDee

Riad Dar Anika,Nils K wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Lovely Riad in the heart of the city,We girlfriend and I had an awesome 4 nights stay at Dar Anika and would definitely recommend the hotel and stay here again.    The entire team around Lyanne was super accommodating from changing us to another more silent and bigger room to buying us suncream bringing us a small snack in the afternoon and handing us a small care package for our flight back home.    The hotel was in a great spot & busy but still silent inside. The restaurant was excellent so we enjoyed a great breakfast every morning on the rooftop and had a great dinner upon arrival.    The rooms are small but have everything they need. Also they are super clean. Windows to the courtyard are not the best noise cancelation but since there are only a few rooms it is almost never noisy.,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/81nilsk
Riad Dar Anika,Kait H wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Everything we wanted our stay to be!,Riad Dar Anika is everything we wanted our stay in the Medina to be…and more! The location is excellent so if you’re looking for a place that melds convenience and hospitality look no further. Situated right on the edge of the old souk it’s close enough to make the highlights of Marrakech all completely walkable but far enough “out” to be quieter at night and a serene refuge at night or during the day. Lyanne is the epitome of what a good manager should be and her attention to detail willingness to help and overall wonderful attitude are such a gift for travelers. Definitely take her up on looking at a map together because she gives great insight on what to see do and most importantly - what to skip or avoid. The staff goes above-and-beyond and if you’re worried about getting lost the riad provides a local cell phone that has Google maps. It worked great! We loved the breakfast (it’s majorly filling!) the afternoon mint slushy drinks relaxing in our room in between souk shopping and the afternoon chocolate and raspberry cake (YUM!). We would definitely come back to Riad Dar Anika.,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Honolulu, Hawaii",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ByKaitHanson
Riad Dar Anika,Snavedog wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Home,There is not much I can add to the many glowing reviews of this place other than an exclamation point (!). I’m generally skeptical of places that have so many positive reviews. I’ve been gamed by TripAdvisor. But in this case I would say they are deserved.    I travel frequently as I have done my entire adult life. Every passport I have ever owned required extra pages. I’ve had the pleasure of staying in many of the finest hotels in the world as well as everything else from rustic lodges B&Bs yachts tents to hostels. The essential quality I look for and that makes me want to come back is do I feel at home? I have an eclectic list of places that I return to for that reason - the Park Hyatt in Tokyo the Pulitzer in Amsterdam the Oriental in Bangkok Greywalls in Scotland. There are others but those come to mind.    I felt that sense immediately when I walked into Dar Anika and it was amplified as I interacted with the many kind people who work there.    If you want a comfortable relaxing spot in an ideal location where all your needs will be cheerfully met look no further. If you want a big fancy hotel with a big screen tv on the wall then keep looking. I for one will look forward to my return to this my new home in Marrakech.,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled solo,"San Francisco, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Snavedog
Riad Dar Anika,janeymac7 wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Peace and tranquiity.,This was our second stay at Dar Anika.The email correspondence from the hotel was again prompt & efficient from reception.We received a warm traditional welcome upon arrival.The room we shared was immaculate and cleaned and refreshed daily. This time we decided to take in the souks and chat with the locals about their produce. We came home with spices and remedies and Lyanne was kind enough to source us some mint tea. A visit to Bahia palace provided good photographic opportunities.Our favourite place to escape to was ' le Jardin secret'. This is a gem of a place with a roof terrace serving lunch. We ate at Dar Anika for 3 evenings ( complete with delicious food and soft live background music) & also experienced the hammam with a lovely lady who works very hard in hot and humid conditions to make your skin feel wonderful! My son was keen to watch a football game one evening. We thought he had ventured out but found him in front of a cosy open fire watching the game; the evening staff found him the correct Tv channel so he would not need to go out and find a bar. We left early on our last day and were given a packed lunch for our flight home. One regret before leaving was that we didn't make enough use of the sun terrace.It is clear that Dar Anika staff are carefully chosen to provide guests with a service that cannot be faulted. With best wishes to Lyanne and staff we look forward to our next visit and cannot thank you all enough for a seamless trip from start to finish.,Date of stay: March 2019,,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janeymac7

Riad Dar Anika,Bartolleren wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Absolutely loved every minute of it!,We stayed at Dar Anika for four days and absolutely loved every minute of it!  Lyanne and her excellent team makes you feel at home the second you enter their beautiful courtyard - we immediately felt at home.  The place is like an oasis in the hustle and bustle of Marrakesh – and it’s only a short walk away from Djemaa El Fna where all the action is.  Coming back to Dar Anika after a day in the busy souks is just what you need – they rock up with homemade cake and smoothies to get the dust out of your system.  The rooftop restaurant makes for an excellent start to the day enjoying the view while indulging in Moroccan pancakes fresh fruit and coffee. And if you don’t want to stroll to far at night the same rooftop restaurant serves excellent local wines and dishes.  The attention to detail by Lyanne and her crew was just amazing – they even made us a delicious lunch bag for our trip home.  We’ve travelled a lot – and it’s not often that we’ve felt so much at home so far from home. Dar Anika gets nothing but our warmest recommendations. And next time we visit Marrakesh there is no doubt about where we’ll be staying.,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Virum, Denmark",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bartolleren

The personnell was all the time one step ahead and thinking our best. An excellent example was when we had done some sightseeing and returned exhausted to the hotel they prepaired and brought us cold drinks and some snacks already before we had even gathered enough strenght to go to the bar to order these.

Where else in the world does the manager buy you drink on an exquisite terrace overlooking a breathtaking city and get to know your story? Where else in the world would the manager (Lyanne) walk you to dinner through the maize of streets through the medina so you don't get lost. Where else in the world do you get a personalized hand written note on your bed of roses before you go to bed? Then make sure that when you leave you are all set with details for your flight-- customs form filled out lunch packed etc. The setting on the rooftop is so inviting we met other travelers and enjoyed the evening getting to know their stories... and of course Lyanne added to that experience as well.

Lyanne and the team looked after us so well it really felt like a home from home. Here's a few reasons why we'll be going back..  - Location is right on the entrance to the Medina.... everything is on your doorstep no schlepping in from afar (like you will at Mamounia etc)  - Few rooms but very well staffed so they all know you by sight arrange your attraction tickets in advance (no queueing) book restos taxis walk with you to show you where to get money or even where your restaurant is book the best guides and there is always a complimentary mint tea and cake to hand.  - Roof terrace with sun loungers and wonderful panoramic views. Extra smaller roof terrace for romantic night cap views of the bustle below and skyline.  - Comfortable surroundings with heated pool sitting room and each bedroom is very individually and well appointed.

The rooms are decorated beautifully but our room was the size of a interior cabin on ship and the bathroom was even smaller. That would be OK if the price was commensurate but it is not. This room was 302 euros per night.    This was our fourth trip to Morocco and we have stayed in several riads so I know what other riads offer in terms of room sizes and costs.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Newport Beach, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/voyager52

Riad Dar Anika,Richard K wrote a review Jan 2019,50,The Riad That Grew On Us,This Riad is ideally located in the Medina but right on the edge so there is no chance of getting lost in the myriad laneways(unless of course you can't find the correct entrance).It was easy to walk to almost everything of tourist interest. On entering the Riad we were first welcomed into a lounge area where Sarah the delightful and very friendly French staff member greeted us and gave us a little talk on how things ran.  There is a lovely small pool in the covered courtyardpossible to swim or paddle in it but never saw anyone actually attempt it. We were then shown to our room and we were instantly shocked and disappointed at how small it was albeit nicely furnished with flower petals strewn over the bed as a welcome.There was not even a window in the room. We decided it was impossible to stay here for 3 days and asked if we could move to another room.Not easy as every room was booked.Nevertheless they magically found another room on the first floor which it turned out was reserved for other guests who had not arrived.We moved there and although not that much bigger it did have a window and we were happy to accept this.    The staff were constantly apologetic and on the second day the manager arrived and offered us a huge compensation which we did not think was right to accept.Everyone on the staff was so kind and by this stage we did not want to hurt their feelings and because of their attitude we were really enjoying the ambience.    On the rooftop there was a pleasant open air restaurant where we had a very good dinner and each morning had breakfast served there. Nothing was too much trouble for anyone and tea or coffee and cakes were available every afternoon-just ask and it was made for you.    By the time we left we were having such a good time we wouldn't have moved anyway    A special experience in a country where everyone showed such kindness ..    Thank you to Sarah and all the staff for making this such a memorable event.

Riad Dar Anika,artzero wrote a review Dec 2018,50,Truly exceptional!,We have stayed at quite a few really fine hotels in many different countries in the world Riad Dar Anika is hands down the best and most memorable we have stayed at. In fact we checked out this morning and already we find ourselves missing the hotel! We became quite attached to the lovely riad and mostly its amazing staff! The riad might not be the most luxurious but it offers many personal touches the best service and most genuine hospitality!    The riad is so wonderful thanks in a great part to its amazing manager Antonio. As other reviewers have pointed out Antonio would meet with his guests upon check in to provide a really helpful overview of the riad. He would also offer great tips on touring in Marrakech. He's genuinely kind helpful and never pushy. He even offered us recommendations on restaurants in Marrakech for dinner when Riad Dar Anika itself has one of the best restaurants in town. I was quite blown away when he gave us a local cell phone with his phone number programmed in the phone and easily accessible. Even though we never ended up using the phone it was such a nice gesture and offered us a great peace of mind.    We also enjoyed our room (room 1). It was lovely decorated and spacious (for three). There were always fresh fruits and water in the room. All the staff members were warm lovely and really kind. The warmth hospitality and care we received were truly genuine. The official breakfast (which was super nice) starts at 8 but on a couple days when we needed to leave early the restaurant staff would be there early to prepare breakfast just for us. At least one of the waiters I noticed was serving dinner the night before till late and had to get up so early to serve us. We had never experienced this kind of service and accommodation anywhere else before!    The hotel location is excellent right in the medina with a 5-minute walk to the Square a 10-minute walk to the Saadian Tombs and a 5-minute walk to the Jewish quarter.    The hotel is very green which is very important to me. They offer great quality argan oil soap body wash shampoo and conditioner all in re-fillable containers which is fantastic. I hate all the wastes we experienced at other hotels.    Finally this morning when we checked out really early Mr Antonio was there in person to see us off and to offer us a bag of sandwiches and fruits for the road because we had to leave so early. I was so moved that I was tearing up!! We loved our first visit to Marrakech but what truly sealed our experience of this great city is the care and hospitality we experienced at Riad Dar Anika!!!! We really hope to come back!,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/artzero
Riad Dar Anika,Francesco G wrote a review Dec 2018,50,Excellent from all points of views,"We chose this Riad for our holiday in Marrakech due to the great reviews here on TripAdvisor. As they are all pretty good our expectations were high. I admit that the Riad managed to exceed them.    Everything worked fine. Antonio the director meets personally each guest and provides good overview of the city a map and even a mobile-phone to avoid to be lost in Marrakech. He and the staff is really aiming to help the guests/customers but it's not the usual ""help to sell"". When we arrived we had already excursions booked on our own and the staff helped us calling the tour operators for confirmation.    We had a request for our room and it has been managed in the same day. When we left they made us few small gifts.    Concerning the Riad itself it's in a perfect location at the end of the city center 2 minutes walk from a roundabout and 5-10 minutes walk from the main square of Marrakech. The rooms are beautiful kept in care at every corner and with all the possible comforts.    For the breakfast the first day we have been a bit disoriented. We were expecting a buffet but when we entered there was no trace of it. Long story short the breakfast is the same for all the guests and it's delicious. It's a traditional Moroccan breakfast including among others an omelette bread orange juice yogurt cake etc. Honestly it's a lot and it's all good.

Riad Dar Anika,LinziG84 wrote a review Dec 2018,50,Fantastic Riad!,If I could give this review more than 5 stars I would.  The location was absolutely perfect close to a lot of the main sites and a short walk to the main square. It's right at the edge of the Medina which means taxi's and transfers for trips can pick you uo from the Riad instead of having to walk to a different location. It feels like a complete oasis of calm away from the crazy hustle and bustle of Marrakech outside.  Our room as clean nicely decorated and a great size for our 5 night stay. If we ever arrived back to the room during the afternoon we were welcomed with cake and a lovely iced strawberry drink delivered to our room.  On check in we were given a map lots of handy tips and recommendations as well as a phone with internet and marrakech sat nav! Amazing.  The breakfast was great although due to arranging early morning trips we only had breakfast twice during our 5 night stay. Restaurant staff were wonderful.  The service and staff was the best I have ever encountered. Always happy to help smiling nothing is too much trouble. I would happily recommend this riad to any family or friends looking to stay in Marrakech.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Llandudno,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LinziG84

However the staff were very attentive. The breakfast was a bit minimalistic compared to other establishments on our 14 day tour. An omelette or a boiled egg was an extra! which rather surprised us.

We had excellent service the entire time with Sarah giving us a detailed welcome and great introduction to Marrakech (what to visit where to eat and how to haggle with locals). One very good detail was that the Riad gave us a mobile phone with GPS and the number of the hotel in case we got lost or had any questions (no other Riad/hotel in Morocco did this). The food was very good and was available at all times. It was also nice to come from a day of sight seeing and have a snack tea or a drink waiting for us as soon as we arrived. The hotel has a nice rooftop and I also enjoyed a hamman and massage. The rooms were well decorated and private and mine had a good hairdryer.

Riad Dar Anika,BrianGreenhalgh wrote a review Nov 2018,50,Birthday trip,We booked Dar Anika for 4 nights this November.    Due to curcumstances out of our control we had to leave Dar Anika after 1 night stay.    So my review is based on the 1 night we had    First of all I would like to say that all of the staff were very very welcoming indeed as soon as we entered the Riad and greeted us with mint tea and biscuits.  After being shown to our room we didnt spend much time there as we were so close to the Madina we went out shopping but like other quest have said they are a bit in the smaller side  On return we had a table booked on the roof top terrace for dinner  the set menu was well priced and I must say the quality was very good indeed ( we had the roast lamb for 2 ) . At the end the staff presented me with a birthday cake and singing happy birthday which was a plesent surprise.    Unfortunately the following day we had to leave the Riad due to personal reasons.  This is where the personal touch came into play  the owner of the Riad understood our problem and he and his team were very sympathetic to say the least which was very touching    So if you are looking for an authentic stay in Marrakech which is not a corporate hotel then Dar Anika will fulfill this for you,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,england,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrianGreen

Marrakech is an interesting with a mix of old and new and worth a visit. I did think the rooms were expensive but the service you get makes it feel worthwhile.    The good:  - Excellent service by all the staff this included the phone with google maps which was helpful  - Location the riad is right inside the Medina so never had a problem getting around our finding our way back.  - You are served a lovely breakfast no getting up 2 or 3 times to self service buffets which was nice for a change.  -We booked a walking tour to the Atlas mountains via the riad and this was one of the highlights of our trip.    There is an out door area at the top of the riad for sunbathing I would suggest adding a few umbrella's as it can get very hot but there is a sister hotel with a swimming pool that guest can use.

The well appointed rooms beautiful courtyard good and plentiful food and ideal location on the edge of the medina should be enough to encourage visitors but it is the personal service that sets this Riad apart. Not only are Antonio and Sarah are always checking in with guests to make sure the stay is as perfect as it can be but every member of staff ( there are a lot of staff for the number of rooms )greets you with a smile and nothing is too much trouble. Without asking cool drinks and snacks appear when you return from the madness outside the Riad umbrellas appear over your head whilst you dodge the showers ( and when it rains in Marrakech it really rains) crossing the courtyard and your room is strewn with rose petals to add to that special experience. One evening we asked if they could suggest somewhere local for a light snack and after a chat amongst themselves they suggested somewhere which was a few minutes walk away rang arranged a table and then arranged for a member of staff to guide us there....always doing that little bit extra.

Riad Dar Anika,Bali S wrote a review Oct 2018,50,Beautiful Riad - Fantastic Marrakech!!!,This place is nice and and cosy. If you like boutique hotels (although this is more of a house) with fantastic service this is the place for you. We stayed 5 nights in October and we had a wonderful time overall. We stayed in the deluxe double room which is highly recommended and go for the rooms upstairs to enjoy the balcony view of the Riad!  We encountered slight issues with communication and some arrangements but this was quickly rectified and the staff were very helpful overall. I recommend if there are any issues you have do voice them before the end of your stay you will be delighted with how they turn things around!  Personally the food was not to our taste but that is not saying the food was bad so we mostly ate out.  We did 3 excursions which I highly recommend - The buggy (not quads) through the dessert half day is so much fun - should out to Bashir at the buggy tours who saw I was getting annoyed that the quads in front were going too slow he took me on a separate path during the whole tour where I could basically test the buggy to it's limits - a lot of fun!!  Next we did the hot air balloon - which was just the most amazing thing. It was a nice day and the ride was so steady! - great views and pictures to be taken.  lastly we did the Atlas Mountains - Imlil Villiage tour - a bit of trekking - no too much as you can tell the guide the routes you want to take - shorter routes are available if you don't want to walk so much.  This Riad has a sister property (Riad Kaiss) which is 5 minutes walk and it has a rooftop pool which we used twice.  Overall if you are looking for fantastic service and want to stay in the heart of the Medina - this is the place to be.

Riad Dar Anika,Davidcastro wrote a review Oct 2018,50,Highly recommendable,I stayed 7 nights in Riad dar Anika in October 2018. I have to recognize I had not previously realized a riad is not a palace nor a mannor it is a house a nice big house but a house. Hence not all rooms are equaly big or equaly decorated (just like in any hotel). On arrival I was given a small and simple room. I asked for a better one. Unfortunately there was no one available for my whole journey so they gave me a nice big well decorated room for half of my stay and mooved me (I didn’t have to do it) after 3 nights to another intermediate room. So I had the chance to see three different rooom all comfortable some nicer none was a suite. The house itslef is nice with a cute yard/garden a small swimming pool (more for decoration than for use) lovely corridors with small tables and sofas a beautiful terrace with a good Morrocan restaurant and bar a nice house for a nice stay. Location is excellent you can walk to almost every touristic place in town. So far so good. What I believe is a reason to choose this riad is its excellent service. All staff including the manager are inmediately available friendly and highly commited to make your stay as good as it can be. It is people working at the riad who make you feel at home kindly treated even pumpered well advised and helped when needed. If you are going to Marrakech and you want to stay in a riad do choose this one you will surely enjoy it as I did and will not regret. If you do go please tell hello and thanks from me to every and each one of the persons who work there. To all of them thank you very much !!

Riad Dar Anika,sara n wrote a review Oct 2018,50,Excellent Stay!,The Staff at Dar Anika were absolutely amazing from start to finish we couldn't have asked for a more perfect stay and would never look elsewhere if we ever go back to Morocco. The attention and friendliness of the staff really made this one of the best trips we have ever had and nicest places we've stayed in mostly because of the friendliness and hospitality provided by the staff here. From the moment we checked in (tea service cookies maps directions cell phone/charger to use during our stay..the list goes on) until the moment we left (they packed us a lunch and gave us parting gifts and even filled out our customs forms!) we were treated like family and this was unlike anything we've ever experienced. We've stayed in 5 star hotels and have never received this kind of treatment we received from the staff at Dar Anika. The rooftop restaurant was so beautiful the food was delicious and the rooms were perfectly appointed and quiet from the bustling city. Our couples Hammam was excellent and relaxing. I could go on and on but if you are considering Dar Anika you shouldn't look any further because this is the place to stay. Thank you all for making our time in Marrakesh so special and for even mailing back my charger left in the room much appreciated! We will certainly be back in the future. It was such a pleasure.

Riad Dar Anika,Barry B wrote a review Oct 2018,50,A Visit to Morocco,We began a recent trip to Morocco in Marrakech. We reserved accommodations at Dar Anika a Riad in that city. They also made bookings for us for a day trip to Essaouira and a 4 day 3 night visit to Merzouga which included a night in the desert. As well they made arrangements for train travel to Casablanca when we departed. All these arrangements were made with care and professional handling of all the details required according to our wishes.  Our accommodations at Dar Anika were most satisfactory. We were warmly greeted on our arrival and subsequently whenever we returned from excursions whether of a few hours or a few days in duration. This welcome and interest in our needs or wishes was displayed by the entire staff.  The meals - whether breakfasts or dinner - offered a great choice of selections were appealingly presented pleasantly and courteously served.  Our room was fresh clean nicely decorated pleasingly furnished and maintained with care and attention during our stay.  My wife and myself would have no hesitation in recommending Dar Anika for the discriminating Marrakech visiter who wishes top notch accommodation hospitality and assistance for a visit in this fascinating city in Morocco.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Burlington, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/417barryb

Riad Dar Anika,toddbrazda wrote a review Oct 2018,50,Wonderful property; attentive staff,We spent part of our honeymoon at Riad Dar Anika and loved our experience; the Riad is very nice and comfortable; common area is great for lounging and drinking tea or enjoying the pool to cool off; the rooftop space is a great oasis for breakfast or dinner; our room was comfortable overall though the temperature is difficult to regulate (no windows to open for ventilation; A/C unit is small and under-powered); staff was attentive the entire time taking very good care of us and setting up transportation excursions massages Hammams etc.; highly recommend this Riad,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Chicago, Illinois",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toddbrazda
Riad Dar Anika,Barbara K wrote a review Oct 2018,50,Outstanding: a Memorable Three Nights,We had been touring Morocco for about 10 days and our last stop before returning back to the USA was for three nights at Dar Anika in Marrakesh. What a fabulous choice. This Riad was the perfect place to end our trip and to help us recover from a very hectic schedule. I'm not sure we have ever stayed at a place with a staff (thanks Antonio) that went so far out of their way to make our stay memorable and to cater to our every need announced and unannounced. A small example my husband's electric razor had just broken the day before and by the time we arrived at the Riad he was too tired to go out to buy a new one. My husband mentioned in passing about his broken razor to Antonio and within a few minutes someone came to our room with a large tube of shaving cream and a decent disposal razor at no charge and without us actually asking for such a thing. The staff tries to anticipate what they can do to help make your visit more comfortable and enjoyable A another example when we left the Raid for our long trip back to the airport in Casablanca to our surprise they had packed in a small gift bag sandwiches fruit and a small poster with our names written out in Arabic. The calligraphy was beautiful.    One night we had dinner at their roof top restaurant. Our 7 course meal (a fixed price dinner) was by far the best meal we had during our two weeks in Morocco and I might say we had already eaten at many high end Moroccan restaurants prior to this point. For the main course my husband had monkfish and I had filet mignon both cooked perfectly in a mild and tasty source. The dinner was well worth the additional expense.    Our room was always kept clean with new rose pedals put on top of our very comfortable bed each day. The Riad is in a great location close to many of the important sites in the old city. When we left the Riad each day they lent us special cell phones even though we had our own to help us if we got lost something easy to do in the Madina. When we returned back to the Riad each day there would always be additional snacks beyond the daily fruit basket and cookies you might expect to see in Morocco's better Riads.    All and all the 5 star rating of this Riad is well deserved.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Delray Beach, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BarbaraK40

Riad Dar Anika,ALLEN K wrote a review Oct 2018,50,Excellent service and location,Four of us stayed in this Riad for five nights. It was a wonderful experience. Sara and her team did an excellent job in making us feel like queens and king.    A friend left her glasses in Casablanca Sara and her team helped to coordinate with different parties and eventually got it back for us. Another got sick Sara helped to get a doctor to come to the Riad to tend to our friend.    Among these incidents we had originally booked two twin rooms but only one available when we arrived. We end up getting two singles and one twin rooms. A pleasant surprise.    The hotel staffs were super nice and friendly. They entertained our every demand and gone beyond. Sara made excellent recommendation on dinner venues. She gave practical and very helpful tips on navigating in the Medina and shopping tips.    Every afternoon when we return from our adventure the road would provide cold drinks and cakes. At night they will provide a small glass of milk and cookies or preserved dates.    The Riad even provide a smartphone that has the hotel contacts in it in case we need emergency assistance.    I can’t express more on how wonderful it has been. I highly recommend this Riad to all and will definitely stay here when I come back to Marrakech.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Shanghai, China",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allenk230

Riad Dar Anika,Katy wrote a review Sep 2018,40,It's taken me a year to write this review,I've been in two minds for the past year on whether I should write a review of Dar Anika and I must say that when I think back to our stay it was one of the more disappointing breaks but this may have been down to my high expectations after reading the reviews on here prior.    We arrived tired and after a thorough check in were shown to our rooms which were really quite small and didn't reflect what I had thought we were staying in on booking.com. Although I travel regularly with work this was a special trip with my family and my Mum was a little disheartened by a dark room. The manager handled the situation well and we were offered another room which she was happy with so thank you for that.    The staff were wonderful and food tasty. I went to spend time relaxing on a lounger but this was a main thoroughfare for the staff and I didn't feel entirely comfortable. We therefore spent most of our time when not exploring Marrakech at their sister property.    My main concern over our stay is that I felt that it provided very poor value for money. When I was booking this holiday I compared many different hotels and riads. I must admit that I regretted booking Dar Anika.    Working in travel I appreciate that service and location etc comes at a premium but on this occasion I felt that it just didn't warrant the price tag compared to other offerings.    I also wanted to mention that when considering Dar Anika do only book the higher category of rooms and take all the reviews on here with a pinch of salt. On departure you are encouraged to raise concerns with management rather than post on TripAdvisor which I really appreciate but it doesn't always present both sides.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Auckland, New Zealand",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katyr2803

Everyone at the Riad Dar Anika were all lovely people so helpful so professional and just beautiful people wonderful people. Since my return to the states I have bragged about my visit to your Riad to everyone who has asked me about my trip. I am already planning on coming back and enjoying more of your beautiful country. When I do return I will be staying with you again. I feel like we arrived not knowing anyone and by the time we left we had made so many friends. Everything you arranged for us the hike into the atlas mountains to visit the berber villages the camel back sunset trip the dinners the gardens it could not have been better. I fell in love with Morocco the culture the people and you will definitely see me again. I hope I didn't drive Sarah and Nadia crazy with all my questions ;))) but they were so amazing love them both. The food the rooms the atmosphere the best ever.

Riad Dar Anika,awhitesides wrote a review Sep 2018,50,Unbelievable experience at Dar Anika,Spent 4 nights at Dar Anika. This was our first time in Marrakech. I do not know which was better the staff or the location but together we could not have chosen a better place. We were picked up from the airport which was a good start as finding our way alone would have been a disaster. It is true what you will read about the hospitality of the people in Marrakech. The staff at the hotel always were friendly and sincere in making your stay a great stay. The location of Dar Anika enables you to walk right out and head to the souks or some of the places to see. The staff will always get you a taxi (which are inexpensive) tell the driver where you are going and also the fare so that you do not get ripped off. The restaurant will serve you the local foods in the upstairs restaurant with great service. Many times at night we would go to the very top of the restaurant drink some wine and watch the street below. The architecture of the building is the real thing. One day we walked over to their sister riad and spent the hot afternoon in the rooftop pool. Never did a staff member not have a smile on his/her face and a genuine spirit of making your trip great. We had a good time trying to use English French and hand gestures in communicating. I have never met more delightful people.

Riad Dar Anika,APairOfShues wrote a review Jul 2018,50,"Beautiful Riad, great location !",We found this Riad after some research on Tripadvisor and were not disappointed. This was our first trip to Marrakech (and Morocco) and it was for a special occasion. Because of this Riad Anika management very generously offered us a bigger room FOC in their sister Riad 3 minutes down the street which was equally as beautiful as the room we had booked. Due to us preferring the location of Anika we decided to stay there for our five day trip. The staff were very welcoming friendly and attended to us without hesitation their attention to detail in service was incredible. The room itself was lovely and we arrived to find rose petals beautifully decorated in the room on our bed and bathroom this along with a cleaned room we found each time we came back after being out all day exploring. The Riad's location is great a couple of minutes to the local stalls and only about 6-8 minutes to the main square (Jemaa el-Fnaa). The food is very good particularly their monkfish dishes and freshly made breads ! We ate breakfast each morning and we couldn't have asked for a more substantial and tasty breakfast to start the day. We really enjoyed staying at Riad Anika and loved our trip to Marrakech - we would recommend this hotel and if you stay then you must try their mint tea absolutely refreshing and delicious.

Riad Dar Anika,Stacey L. wrote a review Jul 2018,50,Will be coming back for sure!,I loved everything about this raid! I initially loved the flowers I saw online in the rooms and I didn’t have a reservation booked so I was praying there was space for us. I’m 6 months pregnant and on top of that I was extremely sick from a cold and exhausted from walking all day. I was having the worst day ever and when we got there the front desk lady was able to show us some rooms. I told her I wouldn’t mind a smaller room as long as it had a bathtub.  When we came back she managed to get us a bigger room with a bath tub so I was super happy!    The room was so beautiful and I really liked the cookies/water/and fridge.  We got to enjoy the pool the next day it was warm :) breakfast was amazing they serve so much and I can barely eat but I tried eating a bit of everything. I don’t usually like harsha bread but they made it super tasty and moist. I especially loved the broccoli soup and some other veggie soup they gave us for breakfast. They also have ice which I love. It’s so hard to find ice in morocco and they even had iced coffee.    I believe check out is at noon but we left early since we are still traveling to see the rest of morocco we have a four hour trip down south and it was super helpful that they gave us a goodie bag with soaps fruit and some sandwiches.    Everyone working at this place was super nice and the hotel was very clean. Since I was sick and didn’t get to see much of Marrakech I will definitely come back. I actually enjoyed staying in the room resting up.  Everything was 5+ stars. Also the map/ travel advisor and how the staff speaks multiple languages really helped a lot. The location of the raid was also perfect since I couldn’t walk much te day after I got there it was a pretty easy walk from the raid to the main square it’s also close to La Bahia palace.    Wish I would have had some change to leave our housekeeping and waiter but I only had my Amex on me. Also I saw that they only accept visa and mastercard I believe.

My room was kept immaculate (seemed like every time I left they cleaned it and put more rose petals on the bed and in the bathroom).    But here's what really got me about the service. When it was time to leave I was presented with some small gifts. I know they do this for everyone but it still felt personal. But even that wasn't the height of the service. First they gave me my already completed customs declaration to help make my airport exit go smoothly the next day. But even that wasn't it. Next they also presented me with a lovely plain white cotton purse with a sandwich and some fruit for my train to Casablanca as they suspected I had not had time for lunch. They were right and I would have been stuck with junky train station food.    Superior service is taking care of my needs when I have them. But extraordinary service is anticipating my needs before I even know I have them and in that Riad Dar Anika was exceptional.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Sebastian, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mara108

Riad Dar Anika,Bruce G wrote a review Jul 2018,50,Two Wonderful Days in Marrakech at Riad Dar Anika,We spent only two days at the wonderful Raid Dar Anika as we were beginning our North Africa and European vacation. Our flight was delayed and we lost a day in this beautiful city. From the the moment you are greeted at the airport; the definition of hospitality is provided by a wonderful staff. When we arrived; we were greeted by Sarah Antonio (owner) and Faduoa welcoming us to their Riad. Sarah provides a gracious welcome provided a mobile phone for our use and highlighted useful information for touring Marrakech.  Dining at the Riad is most certainly not to be missed and we had the pleasure of meeting Mustafa a nice young man that worked at the restaurant.  Take of advantage of the Hamam provided by the Riad; wonderful experience.  Room/bed are both very comfortable Wi-Fi works well and the Riad is within close distance to many of the sights within Marrakech. Easy walks.  Travelers this is a wonderful place with a wonderful staff; you won't be disappointed.

Riad Dar Anika,Jennifer O wrote a review Jul 2018,50,One of the most incredible stays we've ever had...spectacular accommodations and service!,Truly this was the most exclusive intimate outstanding hotel experience I’ve ever had (and I’ve stayed in many dozens of hotels around the world). Antonio Sarah and their entire staff – I wish I could name them all! – provided the most luxurious service possible to their guests … we literally felt like royalty based on how we were treated. They provide their guests a local phone with Dar Anika’s number programmed so that you have a “hotline” to help should you ever need it which made us feel very secure in the foreign surroundings. The rooms were impeccable beautifully appointed roomy and covered in rose petals. The entire riad was gorgeous flush with local décor and what appeared to be hand-selected details in every direction. The rooftop bar and restaurant offered among the most attentive servers and delicious authentic cuisine we’ve ever enjoyed and no need was unattended … not to mention it offered a breathtaking view of the city. And the location at the very edgeof the medina and old city area was extremely convenient for anything we wanted to visit on foot. The staff helped us arrange for a couple of local activities which were similarly top-notch and provided gracious help when we needed it (continually checked with airport regarding the status of a lost bag confirmed existing activity reservations walked to find our arranged transportation so we didn’t have to search the street and many other services). Antonio I cannot give enough compliments to your staff for their INCREDIBLE hospitality and I cannot thank you enough for providing the experience of a lifetime for our family!,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L7609DQjennifero

We relaxed in the sitting area with cool towels while discussing the map of the city and getting local tips in order to make our stay most enjoyable. We were given a local iPhone that we could use at the Medina and throughout our stay which made Google maps very handy getting around.

Riad Dar Anika,qzee330 wrote a review May 2018,50,Stunning in every way,For my birthday I decided to spend a little extra and go for Dar Anika. And I could not have been happier with my choice. A year on I still continue to think about my time here. It was pure bliss. The service was exceptional. The staff were extremely attentive. I received a dozen roses on my birthday and the kitchen staff presented me with a cake and sang happy birthday. I had breakfast on the gorgeous terrace and ate the most delicious food with the bird singing in the background. The Riad is a haven with the hustle and bustle of the city. There are beautiful oils in the bathroom and rose petals on the bed each day to greet you. You must if possible arrange a tour with the very helpful manager for the Atlas mountains. The driver was fantastic and it was an incredible experience. When we came back from our trek we were greeted with fresh watermelon juice and having our shoes cleaned! For our airport travel we were given a packed lunch to eat on the plane. Nothing was too much trouble. The owner spent half an hour helping me get Question Time on the tv so I could watch the election debate!

Riad Dar Anika,Sarav1991 wrote a review May 2018,50,You must stay here,Not that it needs saying but i'll say it anyway Marrakech is a busy and sometimes overwhelming place. For a first timer it was verging on scary. However Riad Dar Anika offered a peaceful sanctuary from the hustle and bustle which surrounds around.    Leanne the assistant manager made us feel welcome from the start (as did every member of staff) giving us good advice about the surroundings and a phone in case of emergencies (The Google Maps on it helped us navigate our way out of the souks once we had gotten lost which everyone inevitably does).    The complementary tea and cookies the fresh varied and wholesome breakfasts and a wonderful dinner ensured we never went hungry.    On departure we received some lovely gifts as well as some sandwiches for the journey. The service is truly outstanding and is reason alone to stay at Dar Anika.

Prior to arriving we received an email with all of the information we could need about getting to the hotel and things to do while we were there. This was so helpful as we both had had busy weeks at work and hadn't had the time to sort out of plans beyond arriving! We were greeted at the airport by a driver and driven to the hotel. It takes about 15 minutes to drive. From the outside of the hotel it doesn't look like much but the inside is spectacular. It is a quiet clean sparkling oasis inside the busy city. We loved it. We were welcomed so warmly were given drinks and snacks as well as tips of what to do and what to be careful of. Our room was big and well furnished. We often came back to the room to find more sweet treats and refreshments. We had dinner at the hotel the first night which was lovely and took recommendations from the hotel staff for dinner the other nights. We also highly recommend hammam at the hotel and the day trip to Imili. Breakfasts at the hotel are a true feast and a great way to start the day. The location is great.

The riad is clean with fresh towels in the room everyday turn down service with a nice touch of fresh dates and milk left in the room at night. The mint tea is a refreshing alternative to coffee or tea although they do offer a comprehensive list of cocktails wine etc. The food was well presented and represented Moroccan cuisine.

He also talked us through a map of the area making recommendations - and provided us with a mobile phone so we had all the contact numbers we needed and access to google maps.

The Riad itself is beautiful with great rooms and rose petals when you arrive etc. The food and service Is also top notch. After a hectic day in Marrakech it was great to come back to this oasis and have a drink.    However the main differentiator was that the manager Antonio really bailed me out of a bad situation where a charge on my credit card by a rug merchant was 10x what I expected it to be. I went to him for help and he used a combination of local contacts and fluent French to help me get it corrected. He then shuttled me around the city by motorbike to make sure it was cleaned up. I feel very certain that at a minimum I otherwise would have spent months haggling with the credit card company to try and get it resolved (if at all).

Riad Dar Anika,knn455 wrote a review Apr 2018,50,We highly recommend Dar Anika and we would love to come back another time!,We stayed at Dar Anika from 31st March to 4th of April 2018. The reception and the staff at the Riad were absolutely fantastic with a very good service attitude! We received good help from the host to organize our stay and Antonio and the others gave useful advice about what we should see and what we should experience during our stay. The hosts were professional and they did what they could to make our stay in Marrakech as good as possible. Our room was always decorated with rose leaves and although our room was a little small we had an amazingly nice stay at Dar Anika. The breakfast was very good and the two dinners we had in their restaurant were lovely. We therefore had a great stay in a lovely riad well located to the main sights of Marrakech.

Riad Dar Anika,Jonathan E wrote a review Apr 2018,40,Dar Anika- March 2018 Review,My overall experience at Riad Dar Anika was extremely positive. The staff were welcoming and the room was ready as soon as we arrived which is always nice. They were very helpful in helping us plan our activities in Marrakech and the location of the riad is very convenient in terms of distance from key things to do in the city. The one small issue I had is the food selection at breakfast- I would recommend letting the hotel know beforehand if you have special dietary restrictions and if there are things in particular you like to eat at breakfast. All in all I highly recommend a stay at Riad Dar Anika if you are visiting Marrakech.,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonathane293
Riad Dar Anika,OzCindy wrote a review Apr 2018,50,Wonderful service from the team at Dar Anika,We stayed here over Easter and from start to finish we had a really good experience with the team at Dar Anika. From Ms Hind answering emails at all time of day to help us organise our stay to the welcome given on our late arrival Antonio and Lyanne's helpful advice of what to do and see during our stay and the general kindness and professionalism shown by all of the team during our visit; they really go above and beyond to make your time there great.    On arrival we had milk dates tea fruits whilst all of the administrative tasks were completed. Our room was adorned with rose petals and the bathroom and bedroom were of a very good size. Breakfast is never ending from soups to local specialties fresh juice Moroccan tea and more; you won't go wanting!    The team organised a great guide for us and then helped with restaurant bookings. They even organised a bad of goodies on our departure (sandwiches fruit) for our travel to the Atlas mountains.

Riad Dar Anika,janeymac7 wrote a review Apr 2018,50,3 day break at Dar Anika in Marrakesh.,Hind and Maria dealt with our email booking very promptly and kindly organised a birthday cake a wonderful day trip to the Atlas mountains and a cream tea at the Royal Mansour each that made the trip for a 21st birthday very special. We were greeted at the airport and immediately transported to the tranquil haven that is Dar Anika. A warm Moroccan welcome ( and breakfast ) awaited us and Antonio the manager took time to help us plan our stay and we were given a detailed map and a mobile phone for use if we wished any assistance or information whilst we were out and about sightseeing.The rooms are immaculate and cleaned daily completed with a flourish of fresh rose petals! Staff are always on hand to escort you to/ from the hotel to a private taxi and we had the same driver for the duration of our stay. The first day we took in the colourful souks El badi palace ruins Jemaa el-Fnaa square and finished the evening with dinner at the hotel. This was so good that we ate there every evening and took time to relax listening to the live music in the background. Antonio must be proud of his staff; they take pride in their work and your comfort is their main concern. Our second day took us to the Atlas mountain trip. Hassan was our knowledgable guide who ensured we were walking at a comfortable pace for as long or as little as we wished. We stopped for toilet breaks and bought some books from a local shop for the delighted children in his village. Tip - take a few MAD's with you for this. Hassan's wife cooked us two meals that were served by Hassan on his roof terrace. I have never sat anywhere so beautiful and peaceful ever. It is a shame that we did not have enough time to fit in some of the other trips or hammam that the hotel offer. When you arrive back to the hotel from wherever you have been that day you will be greeted with a cold fruit smoothie or mint tea and biscuits to refresh you. Our final day started with the usual several courses for breakfast and culminated with delicious birthday cake fresh flowers and happy birthday sing song from all the staff :-) Airport transport is recommended and booked through the hotel - (we were also given a bag of sandwiches and fresh fruit for our plane journey home) Riad Dar Anika is a special and calming place to stay and we would return and recommend it without question !,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janeymac7

Riad Dar Anika,patmz wrote a review Apr 2018,50,Attention to details and personal touch at Max level,We stayed at countless hotels and never felt the need to write an review but Dar Anika truly deserves one. I am going to skip the part about how pretty the hotel and rooms are and how soft the duvet covers are and go straight to the details. In Morocco guests are required to fill in this check-in form to list passport number nationality address etc every time they arrive at a hotel which was very tedious. Dar Anika does this for you we arrived and were greeted with rose water and wet towels to wash and mint tea and cookies to reflex while they filled out the form for us all we needed to do was to sign at the end. Another thing is there is no end time for breakfast we woke up at 1:00 pm thought we missed it but was told we can have it any time we wanted. After that the hotel manager Antonio greeted us and told us not to go the Jardin Majorelle at that time because there is going to be a 2 hrs lineup for tickets then offered us the service to buy tickets for the next day to skip the lineup and also offered phones with data and maps which all comes with a small fee which we were happy to pay. Moreover we were greeted with fresh juice every time we returned and rooms made with different flower petals. What's even more impressive is that on the morning we checked out the manager prepared sandwiches cookies and fruits for us to take to the airport in 2 small bags a letter of thank you and a name tag of us hand written in Arabic. Dar Anika brings a real personal touch we haven't seen in any hotels before and it truly deserves more than a 5 stars rating.,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Toronto, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patmz

Step outside the front door and you’re inside the vibrant market. While inside the street noise is completely unnoticeable.    Saying the staff was wonderful is an understatement. Staff members including the owner were always visible and eager to help or answer any questions we had. Everyone was so approachable and genuinely friendly. We were supplied a cell phone upon arrival with preloaded maps for navigating the city.

The entire staff was terrific helpful and friendly. Every time we returned from a day of sight seeing we were met with either a cold beverage or mint tea. There was nothing they would not to do for us from making reservations finding us cars booking tours and giving suggestions and recommendations.

Riad Dar Anika,GoPlaces762213 wrote a review Mar 2018,50,Amazing stay!,Having never been to Marrakech and hearing such varied stories from friends who had been before we had no idea what to expect but finding and choosing Dar anika genuinely was the best possible choice we could’ve made. All the reviews praising the staff in addition to the beautiful photos we found online confirmed this would be the place for us to stay. They were even offering a discount for booking directly with them! The price offered was far more palatable than what we were finding on Expedia which made it that much easier to relax and enjoy our time away :)    This level of value we received simply CAN NOT be found anywhere else everything from the smartphone we were given at the start (which had any important numbers already on there; the manager reception and driver to name a few) to the packed lunch we received on our way to the airport all our needs were taken care of before we even knew we had them! Not to mention the additional discount we received due to my partner insisting on paying in cash what a lovely surprise!    So a big thank you to all the staff and the manager Antoni for all the effort put into making our stay so perfect.

Boy are we glad we did and particularly at Dar Anika. Manager Antonio and his staff are warm welcoming and go the extra distance to provide a wonderful experience in the heart of the city. Upon arrival your are warmly greeted and provided an orientation complete with a cell phone with map. We spent a 4 day weekend celebrating our niece's birthday and wonder of wonders following our breakfast on that day she was presented to our surprise with a wonderful chocolate cake and the entire staff singing Happy Birthday in French and Arabic! The rooms were wonderful and the souk main square and many of the major sights and sounds are within walking distance. The rooftop restaurant is also terrific with fresh baked breads and crepes for breakfast and a wonderful dinner which is highly recommended if you arrive late in the day and are not quite ready to hit the streets. After a day of sight seeing entering through the heavy door takes you into a veritable oasis to relax reminisce about your activities of the day and plan for tomorrow.

Riad Dar Anika,Scott M wrote a review Mar 2018,50,Outstanding Service - No Really,I stayed with my wife and 2 daughters for 3 nights. Each day something reminded me that this is not a normal hotel. On the first day they provided us with a cell phone that we could use for our stay as our home cell phones could not get data. On the second day my 5 year old daughter had her pencil tip break at dinner - we asked if they by chance could sharpen her pencil - 15 minutes later a pencil sharpener appeared (they went out and bought one at 8PM) On the third day the British woman behind me at breakfast spent 15 minutes chatting with the assistant manager who she had befriended on her visit the prior year - and then proceeded to present him with her homemade marmalade she brought just for him. On the 4th day I left my i-phone in my room and we checked out They found it and ran after us on the street to return it. I wish I could say I was testing their honesty - but I was just being careless. I am sure the staff is well paid but I was impressed by their decency.    There are certainly larger and more opulent rooms to be had - but a nicer staff - that is going to be a tough one.    The location also depends what you want. I thought it was a plus that it was really in the city connected there is a pulse there is vibrancy. If you just want to veg out there are better places - but if you want to see and feel the city Road Dar Anika is an excellent choice. The small scale of the hotel allows for service that is almost impossible at the larger hotels.

Riad Dar Anika,Earl G wrote a review Mar 2018,50,The best riad in town...,Well what can I say?    This was our first trip to Marrakech and as we traveled from the airport to Dar Anika late in the evening at the beginning of our five night stay; I was unsure what to make of this crazy - busy metropolis?  However my mild concerns were soon put well to bed as the doors to Dar Anika opened in front of us and we were greeted by the team that subsequently looked after us for the duration of our stay.    From start to finish this is 5* plus! levels of service; we’ve been lucky enough to have stayed in some nice places in the past and this beautiful riad is up there with the best.    After a restful first night’s sleep we were met by Abu who owns and manages the place and it’s equally (if not more🙂) impressive sister riad - Dar Kaiss with his brother which is situated a few streets away.  Abu took time out to personally draw up an itinerary for our five night stay that saw us do everything from trekking in the Atlas Mountains; to eating in the finest restaurants; to getting absolutely lost in the Souks! and soaking up some real Moroccan culture in many of the fine sights that surround this perfectly located property.

The staff were so thoughtful and attentive and they always had a big smile on their face. We ate at the restaurant one night and had breakfast at the Riad every morning the focus on traditional morrocan food only added to the charm of the Riad and it was always delicious - I would highly recommend the Monk Fish dish. If you want to eat elsewhere they also make great recommendations for local restaurants.    We booked two extras during our stay the first was a hammam and massage in their sister hotel which was amazing one of the best massages I have ever had. The hammam was a completely new experience..... I’ve never felt so clean! The second excursion was quad biking in the Atlas Mountains which was great fun! The scenery is stunning particularly in March when there is snow on the mountains and the guide really cared for our safety. We would definitely do this again!

Riad Dar Anika,Vince McLean wrote a review Mar 2018,50,Well-Placed Haven Amid The Bustle of Marrakech,"We stayed at Riad Dar Anika with another couple on a short 4 night city break. From moment of arrival we were extremely well tended to by Antonio the owner and all of his wonderful team. The Riad is not large (which is mainly why we chose it) but is traditionally constructed around a central internal courtyard with balconies off this leading to the guest rooms and open to the sky at the top. On the rooftop is the lovely Riad restaurant serving all of the meals of the day from breakfast to dinner and beers / cocktails any time you fancy (unlike may restaurants in Marrakech private Riads can sell alcohol even if they are in sight of a mosque). Breakfast is filling and lovely. And we had dinner one night which was also of a very high standard. We were given a quick 20 minute ""how to do Marrakech"" by the owner Antonio who helpfully marked up a map of the city with places to see and good walking routes to take it all in - very helpful and not at all condescending or lengthy - he even pointed out and recommended other restaurants to try so he was keen for us to experience Marrakech as well not just sell his own restaurant to us! The Riad is right on the edge of the Medina by a square call Bab El Mellah - this means it's perfect to get a taxi there from the airport or if you venture out as there is a large taxi rank in Bab El Mellah Square AND it provides very easy walking access into the old Medina and Jemaa El Fna the main square of the Marrakech market traders. The Riad also has its own car and driver if you prefer to using the street taxis although for tourists either are perfectly safe (the street taxis being cheaper of course). We walked the city end to end over 4 days and loved the sights and sounds we experienced - please do not let anyone put you off Morocco by telling you that you will be hassled by street vendors - simply not true in 2018. If you walk through the souks and markets they will of course try to sell you stuff (that's why they are there) but if you don't want it you just have to politely decline and our experience was they leave it at that. The Riad Dar Anika rooms are well appointed - traditionally furnished many with four poster beds and as some have commented here not all of the rooms are large - but this is a traditional Riad not the Hilton so my advice is to choose what you want before you travel! If you are after a welcoming safe secure clean friendly environment to relax for a few days I do not think you can go wrong with Dar Anika.

Riad Dar Anika,weddingw1 wrote a review Feb 2018,50,Best Service and Overall Experience,Overall: The riad was beautiful quiet welcoming and extremely comfortable. The riad provided a stress free environment to relax after a hard day of sightseeing.    Service: The service provided by the staff was the best I have ever experienced from my travels throughout the world. The level of detail the service provided was just amazing. Despite arriving late in the evening the staff had arranged private airport transfer and welcomed us with tea and pastries. The next morning we had the best breakfast I have ever had the pleasure of eating from a hotel (more about this later). After the breakfast the manager sat us down and gave us a complete overview of the area and offered his assistance in helping us schedule anything we wanted to do. Additionally we were provided with a smart phone to ensure we would never get lost and could get in contact with the staff if needed. Then to our delightful surprise after a day of walking the city the staff brought cold daiquiris to our room. I could easily go on for an hour about the high quality of service provided. Do not think twice about staying at this riad. Oh even on our way back to the airport the riad provided us with a small bag with sandwiches and fresh fruit for our travels. Then on the way to the airport my wife realized she had left her bag behind. The riad quickly sent her bag in another vehicle which delivered the bag to us at the airport. Truly amazing service and staff. All the employees were extremely polite and helpful the entire trip. I have never felt so welcomed on vacation.    Food: Amazing. The breakfast was beyond all expectations. There was soup yogurt fruit salad crepes eggs made to order fresh pastries fresh orange juice tea coffee etc. Everything was fresh and delightful. Again the staff’s service even at breakfast was simply perfect. Furthermore dinner did not disappoint. The dinner at the riad was the best we had in Marrakech. We ate at several restaurants with the highest of ratings throughout the town but none of the other restaurants compared to the Riad. The atmosphere was perfect. Every night there was live music. The music was at the perfect volume and did not distract from the overall atmosphere.    Again I can’t say enough good things about our stay.

The rooms could use some love and care a little refresher in the decor. The suite we stayed in was a bit run down.  The manager Antonio and his staff are all incredible in doing their jobs. Oh and they took care of me after I feel ill even making special trips to the market for things that might make me feel better. After a day and a half I was feeling much better. Thank you to all the staff for their sincere care. The pool is heated and pretty the rooftop restaurant was a nice place to enjoy breakfast and/or lunch..

Riad Dar Anika,MBZBOY wrote a review Feb 2018,50,5 Star Service,Marrakesh     There are 5 Star hotels and Boutique hotels rarely is there a Boutique hotel with 5 Star service.  Riad dar Anika is just such a hotel.  Ok so you have to fly to Marrakech to stay there it's well worth the trip.      We were greeted on arrival withMoroccan tea milk & pastries in the lovely court yard  just off the main entrance.  Our room was strewn with rose pedals gratis water and more pastries. Every day they were replaced. While the room was small it was just perfect for 2. The shower will accommodate 2 cozily with plenty of towels.    The hotel manager Antonio sat with us answering questions giving us a detailed overview of the city.  He offered to schedule trips book us transportation etc.  I'll revisit this later I want to tell you more about the hotel.    I wake before my Significant Other (SO) and rather than disturb her I stepped out of our room to one of many cubbyholes with couches footrest & chairs.  Rarely was I there for long when staff began arriving offering me tea or coffee. PS. The stairs are hand cleaned by a staff person with towels.      There is a restaurant upstairs where we had our best meal in Marrakech Vermicelli & Chicken.  The service was worthy of a Michelin star.  Yes we've been to many 3 star Michelin restaurants. While we dined there were 2 musicians playing what I assume was local music.  It certainly enhanced the dining experience.     We had the hotel book a car one night to avoid negotiating to/from trips to a restaurant a 15/20 minute ride.  This was a wise choice as this restaurant sits on the outskirts of town with no noticeable traffic.  We liked the car service so much we booked our airport return with them.     Suggestion book pickup at the airport unless you were raised in a family of Horse Traders and actually enjoy negotiating every cab ride.  I was raised in such a household and negotiated 150$Dirham to the hotel.  If you factor in the highway robbery of changing USD to Dihram at an airport kiosk there was no savings over the Hotels pickup charge.      The Riad manager Antonio is amazing.  Great service is because of great management.  Every person in the hotel offered any service we could ask.  All were done gleefully rapidly and with a thank you on their lips. Many times we were stopped and asked if they could do something for us answer questions recommend a restaurant hail a cab point us in the correct direction. Great staff backed by a Great boss.     I posted pix of the Riad on my FB page only to have a friend say he had stayed in the hotel in 2017.  He could not praise the hotel enough. We both agree it is our favorite hotel anywhere.    We left early in the morning and as we left The manager gave us a bag filled with fruit & breakfast sandwiches for our flight.  It's the little details that make an amazing experience.

The hotel itself is lovely and quiet with a subtle and beautiful decor. The roof top restaurant and bar are captivating and the food and wine offerings were sublime.

Riad Dar Anika,wildcatmama2 wrote a review Jan 2018,50,Magical oasis within the Medina of Marrakech!,"Stop searching for the perfect place to stay on your visit to Marrakech! Morocco can be a culture shock for foreigners but Riad Dar Anika will make all the difference between an absolute dream come true and a nightmare! Sure there are less expensive places to stay but this is so worth the splurge for the peace of mind that comes from being nestled within the safe oasis and absolute paradise of Road Dar Anika where they see to your every request with the response ""As you wish"". My husband and I visited Morocco with our 18 year old daughter so her safety as well as our own was of upmost importance to us. From the moment we made our reservation they reached out to us by email with important information about our upcoming stay. They offered transportation to/from the airport (which I highly recommend) meals to be ready upon our arrival (which I didn't book but we were able to order lunch upon our arrival anyway) and a fantastic selection of activities that we could prebook (we chose the desert camel ride excursion (loved it)! Their driver was waiting for us at the airport upon our arrival. He spoke perfect English and made us feel so welcome and so comfortable on the drive. The hotel is located on a pedestrian-only street so he dropped at the nearest point which is a lively intersection within the medina full of cars people mopeds animals and all kinds of incredible sights sounds & smells that will overwhelm your senses! But there was an employee from the hotel waiting when our van pulled up to carry our bags and guide us safely to the riad. As soon as you enter you are struck by the beauty within and they immediately made us comfortable on sofas within a glass room overlook the courtyard pool. It was now time for tea! Everywhere you go in Morocco they will offer you hot mint tea and cookies! And the tea service is a whole elaborate production! Them the manager came and sat with us to welcome us and find out what we wanted and didn't want during our stay. He then went through everything we needed to know to have a safe and enjoyable visit and offered to help us in any way we desired. This little chat squashed any concerns we had. My husband asked where the nearest ATM was so that we could get some local currency it was just around the corner but he assisted on sending an employee with us who led us there and then stood behind us to make sure nobody bothered us while we used the ATM. Now when I say bothered I don't mean in a physical way. We took a lot of comfort in being told that 90% of the locals earn their living from tourism so although they want your money they will never so much as harm a hair on your head to get it because the king has very strict punishments for anyone lays a finger on a tourist. After lunch we took a stroll to Marrakech's main square Jema El-Fna. We've traveled all over the world but this was like nothing we've ever seen! It was a great introduction to the city and not to be missed but it was summer and it was Africa hot so we were happy to return to Riad Dar Anika for a refreshing swim in the pool before the a delicious Moroccan dinner overlooking the courtyard pool while enjoying live Moroccan music. Day # 2 we enjoyed breakfast by the same pool before a van picked is up for a 30-minute drive outside of the Medina for our 90-minute camel ride in the desert. I'm so glad we booked this directly through our hotel as we knew we were in good hands and completely safe. There was a whole group of tourists from other hotels as well and the camel guide took a lot of care assigning us to the best camel for each of according to size and disposition while at the same time keeping families together. The camel guide was French and spoke enough of several languages to give us all detailed instructions on to how to mount the camels safely (while they were sitting in a line connected to each other by rope) and more importantly how to stay on when the camels all simultaneously stand up. They had given us all authentic Moroccos robes and turbans to wear and they were clean and pressed and perfect for souvenir photos! They are quite accommodating if you ask them to take photos with your own camera but don't worry if you forgot yours because they also take one of each person and at the end of your ride they hand you a complimentary print they made for you! And by the way you can keep your camera and your purse or backpack with you during the entire ride because they show you how to hang it from the camel's saddle handle. The ride is within a little desert oasis so no cars to worry about and it's so easy and so fun with lots of interaction between the guide and all the riders. 1/2 way through there is a break and everyone gets off camels and pose for more photos etc before riding back to the starting point where you enter.a little house for bathrooms before being served hot mint tea and the most delicious fried treats. Once we returned back to our hotel we desperately need another swim in our hotel pool before a relaxing dinner and night in our hotel. You could absolutely fit in another adventure in the evening but we were tired and the rooms are so fantastic we wanted some time to just enjoy them. Day #3 we wanted to sunbathe and although Riad Dar Anika has an indoor pool their sister property has a rooftop pool just a short stroll away and they offered us to let us use it. It was perfect! The manager escorted us down there and introduced us to the staff who he instructed to look after our every need. They generously provided an available room for us to change in and we spent a couple hours drinking fresh squeezed juice while alternating between lounging in the sun and cooling off in the pool. Afterward my husband and thoroughly enjoyed a couple's hamman which is a traditional Moroccan bath.You start nude (or in underwear if you prefer) and an attendant preforms a series of rituals from ladeling hot water all over you to rubbing black mud all over your body scrubbing your body from top to bottom exfoiliating your skin giviing you a massage and washing your hair. Afterward they wrap you in robes and guess what...they serve you hot Moroccan tea! The whole experience was absolutely heavenly and not to be missed! That night we had a special dinner planned outside of our hotel (I will review that seperatley). Day #4 we booked a guide through our riad to take us shopping in the famous souks of Marrakesh. It's a little walk beyond the main square we visited on our first day. We thought hiring a guide would help us navigating the endless stalls down a maze of winding paths and it did as well as help us haggle for a fair price (this didn't really seem to be the case). But the main problem was that I like to look at everything before I decide what I'm going to buy. We spent 3 hours walking around looking around at all the merchant stalls selling everything from kaftan robes slippers leather goods spices arcane oil and beauty products to lamps rugs. Since we had a flight to catch that night this didn't allow enough time to go back and make final purchase decision so I recommend not waiting until your last day to do this. Anyway this review is about Riad Dar Anika and I wholeheartedly recommend staying here when you visit Morocco. Everything from rooms to cleanliness to food to service and more was absolute perfection!

Riad Dar Anika,nmw27 wrote a review Jan 2018,30,Very small rooms,We booked into Dar Anika based on the reviews in Tripadvisor. What no one mentioned was that some of the rooms are very small and face onto the main small road down to the Square (Room 6). Window opening was thus not an option. Also breakfast is on the terrace directly above this room and all movement of chairs and tables is clearly audible below. Not good.    We made immediate complaints that the allotted room did not constitute a luxury room but the Riad was full that night. Fortunately the owner has another Riad only 5 minutes walk away and we were transferred to Riad Kaiss.    None of this was ideal but I must report that at all times the staff were more than courteous kind and helpful.

There are so many wonderful things to mention so I hope I manage to remember everything:  Rooms - the bedrooms and bathrooms are beautiful the design is stylish the attention to detail is impeccable and the public areas (corridors pool rooftop garden and restaurant) are also attractive very clean and just wonderful to be in. There is a very calm atmosphere here and Dar Anika provides a tranquil oasis from the hustle and bustle of the manic streets outside.  Restaurant - the food is of a high standard very tasty and served by caring friendly staff. The breakfasts are so filling that you will need to walk a very very long way to work them off! On that subject however do not be surprised if you are served soup with breakfast. Some of you may be surprised by that tradition but I assure you it is worth trying.  Staff - everyone here has the knack of anticipating everything you might need without being overbearing. The manager was immensely helpful and the font of knowledge for advice on what to do both locally and further afield. He even supplied us with a mobile number to call if we ever encountered a problem when out and about. On leaving he provided us with a snack and fruit for our onward journey. I still have the beautiful canvas bag it was served in and use it with fond memories.  I would recommend using their airport pick up and drop off service along with considering one of their organised tours or treks.  Treatments/Spa/Pool - I would also highly recommend giving the hammam a try and if time and budget allow a massage. My skin has never looked so healthy for several years. If I could I would go all the way back just for a hammam...  The pool is chilly and refreshing. Both the pool at the Dar Anika and at their sister hotel are stunning and eminently instagrammable!  That covers about the gist of it. If you are a couple looking to celebrate a wedding or an anniversary then this is the place for you. If you are looking to celebrate a special birthday then this is the place for you. If you appreciate beauty in design and want to go somewhere that you will remember forever then this is the place for you.  There is a reason that this place scores highly on Trip advisor and the reason is  quite simply that the Dar Anika looks after its customers. Nothing is too much trouble.  Thank you all for a wonderful wedding anniversary that I celebrated with you Dar Anika. I will be back,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Ashford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Suzanne-B-2000

Riad Dar Anika,icrown wrote a review Dec 2017,50,"Beautiful riad, wonderful staff!",My husband and I had the true pleasure of staying at this riad for 6 days. From the moment we arrived everything was wonderful.  The riad emailed us prior to our departure from the USA to confirm our visit and also gave us a few tips for navigating the airport. They also let us know that that had a driver to pick us up if we wanted that service. What a welcome relief. The thought of navigating a taxi after 15 hours of flying sounded too stressful. Our flight was 2 hours late arriving and the hotel driver was waiting on us. Bless him.  Upon arrival at the riad the staff set us in a wonderful lounge room and bought hot mint tea cookies and dates. Also they gave us warm cloths to clean our hands and sprinkled our hands with rose water. Wow!  Our first morning we met with the manager Abu. He gave us a map and made suggestions for us. This was so helpful. It saved us time money and energy.  Breakfast was an experience. The waiters would bring out several different courses and quickly clean away our used dishes. Such service!  We ate dinner at the roof top restaurant twice and the food was clearly prepared by an experienced chef. There was wonderful live music and beautiful burning candles everywhere. It was the cold season when we were there so small heaters were running and I was given a warm cape to put on. The cape was so nice that they helped me order some from their tailor; I took them home as gifts.  The room was very comfortable and modern. We were amazed how often the kind maids came to refresh the room. This included sprinkling fresh rose petals on the bed and in the bathroom. There was a variety of pillows and a great memory foam bed topper. The manager Abu was concerned that the Call to Prayer would wake us up in the morning as there is a mosque nearby our window. He had made window covers with padding to muffle the noise. Amazing attention to detail.  The common area and lounge were beautiful. At night the glow of the pool and all the candles were simply magical. The cleaning staff was constantly tidying up.  After coming in from a day of shopping we heard a knock on our door. Staff was delivering a frozen fruit drink to refresh us.  The location of the hotel is perfect. It was a 5 minute walk to the main square down the small street next to our hotel. Once you get to the main square you can orient yourself and get just about anywhere on foot.  We did take advantage of the hammam and the spa. We had never done a hamman before and did not know what to expect. The lady who took care of us was so gracious and made it easy to relax and enjoy a skin cleansing used for centuries by the local people. It was very private  professional and we could do it as a couple. We would not have done a public hammam. The young lady who did my massage and mani/pedi was wonderful.  In fact the entire staff was wonderful. They are genuine caring people and it shows in their work and their smiles. Many riads exist in Morocco but we believe you would be hard pressed to find one more attentive to service cleanliness and a desire to give you the best experience than this one.  If you have any reservations about coming to Morocco please lay those aside. its is a country of wonderful inviting people and a beautiful place to visit.

Everybody was so friendly and really went out of their way to make sure we had the best time in Marrakech.  Highlights: the wonderful welcome of dates and milk breakfast and dinner on the glorious roof terrace Antonio taking the time to really help us plan our visit and organize our trip to the Atlas Mountains the lovely staff and the location just on the edge of the souks. They even prepared us a packed lunch for our bus ride to Essaouria.    Would definitely come back and highly recommend.

Riad Dar Anika,Lia W wrote a review Dec 2017,50,Spectacular,I cannot recommend this place enough! You must stay here. We stayed at two Riad's while we were in Morocco the first which was Dar Anika (and the second one was in Fez). It was almost hard to enjoy the second riad because Dar Anika goes ABOVE and BEYOND what is expected when you stay at a Riad.    From the moment we stepped in we felt welcome. We were offered tea and were able to relax while they checked us in. Antonio the manager at the riad came to meet us and then sat down with us to tell us about Marrakech. He provided us with a map explained how to get places that we were hoping to see and also gave us new ideas of where to visit. He also gave us tips and tricks for navigating the city and how to stay safe. The fact that he took time out of his day to do this was beyond my expectation!    Our rooms were spotless and comfortable. The beds were so comfortable! There were also snacks provided as well as beverages. We would also be provided with milk and dates at the end of the day which is a Berber tradition to welcome guests as well as fresh squeezed juices.    Our first night there we ate dinner at the restaurant and it was delicious! We split the lamb for two and it was perfect -- although quite a bit of food so GO HUNGRY! Everything was flavorful and incredible! If you aren't lucky enough to stay at Dar Anika you should at least go for dinner!    Breakfast was also delicious and fresh. Fresh pancakes omelettes and bread were made fresh every morning in a traditional fashion. On our last day our driver was coming at 8 am and so they arranged for us to have our breakfast early which was such a nice touch! In fact they also packed us a to go lunch just in case we got hungry in the car :)    I have to give a special shoutout to Antonio and his entire staff. I wish I remember ALL of their names (Ridwan - I remember yours since it sounds like red wine!) because they all were so kind and welcoming! We enjoyed chatting with them and getting to know them. Ridwan actually saw us out walking around in the Jemaa el Fna recognized us and talked to us on his day off. We loved all the staff and cannot say enough good words about them. They work so hard to make your stay memorable.    One more thing -- we did the Hamam at Dar Anika and loved it! It is small but perfect for a couple. The woman who does the Hamam was lovely kind and made us both feel so comfortable. The products they use are natural and good quality. Also importantly the hamam is SPOTLESS. If you are going to be getting (almost) naked in a hamam you don't want it to be dirty. Highly recommend -- and then follow it up with a massage.    All in all Dar Anika was amazing and we are already wanting to go back! Hopefully we are able to make it to Marrakech in near future and if we are -- we will definitely be staying at Dar Anika!,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/502lian

And by the time you leave you just want to stay longer. The entire staff is amazing and all they want is to make sure you have a great time. Antonio and his team really care about you having the best possible experience in Marrakesh. The roof top is the best place to have breakfast or a tea... and breakfast is great!    The location is perfect. You can walk everywhere cabs are always available a 2min walk by the roundabout and if you want to take a break mid day you are usually never more than a 20min walk away.

This is where to go if you fantasize about staying in a far off land in an old world style glamorous romantic and intimate hotel. It is located on the edge of the medina in the old Jewish quarter where you feel like you will run into Indiana Jones. A hotel that caters to your every whim. The food is exquisite 5 star quality The rooms make you feel like you are back in time with old world glamour. The staff is dedicated to ensuring that your stay is 100% memorable and will go all out to provide for your every need. If they don't have something you desire then rest assured that they will go out and find it for you. Don't waste your time going anywhere else.

Riad Dar Anika,Philip L wrote a review Nov 2017,50,Home Away From Home,It had been a long drive from Fes to Marrakech and when we arrived at the Riad Dar Anika I was tired and grumpy. It was hot and the Riad itself did not compare to the grandeur of the Riad in Fes. It didn’t help when we walked the medina because when compared with the quiet calm of Fes the medina of Marrakech was dusty and dirty and one was assaulted by the diesel and gas fumes of the motorbikes that seemed more of a presence than the busy crowds. There was the constant worry that you would be run down by them on the narrow streets. Our room turned out to be small and cramped as all the rooms were full. That night I told my wife that I was prepared to give it a two out of five stars despite the thorough briefing about “the what to do and not do” in Marrakech when we first arrived. We were to stay four nights and I did not have high expectations.  But gradually almost imperceptibly we were thoroughly seduced by all that is the Riad Dar Anika. A Riad is a home. Its outer walls are unassuming but inside it is inviting and protective and a sanctuary. Riad Dar Anika represents the best of that tradition. In retrospect it began with that very first briefing when we were asked what was of interest to us and we were then presented with options. We were guided as to how to negotiate with the vendors how much to pay taxis what areas to avoid and where not to eat. We left that briefing wishing that we had been given that introduction when we first came to Morocco a week before. We were moved to the number 1 room when it became available. Recommendations were spot on.  Every member of the staff attended to our every need. We were asked not to tip them and that leaving a tip at the end was at our discretion and not expected. It allowed us to enjoy the interaction with them rather than struggle with the barrier of a monetary interaction. Complimentary pastries and fruits were always available. Staff would escort us down the street to hail a taxi. When I asked for a paper clip to pop out a SIM card for my phone the manager actually produced one on the spot that was already bent. He said that he carried them with him because the guests sometimes requested it. When one young staffer was asked about how he liked working there he said that he enjoyed it very much and that the manager was like a father to him. On the terrace one staff member brought extra peanuts rather than the usual mixed nuts because he noted that my wife preferred them. And at breakfast crêpes and eggs were brought without request after noting our preference. At the end when we left for the airport the owner and manager and staff said goodbye and we were given a carrying bag of fruit and sandwiches with a customs form that was already filled out for the both of us. The attention to detail the smiles the caring about our well-being were ever present. Abu is one of the owners and it is his warmth and caring that cascades down to the staff. And just as Dar Anika gave a sense of being a guest of a family I too felt that I had developed a sense of family in that I sincerely invited him to see us if he ever came to San Francisco so that we could host him as well. We felt that the Riad Dar Anika was a home away from home.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled solo,"San Francisco, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhilipL668
Riad Dar Anika,luvtogetawaynow wrote a review Nov 2017,50,"Don't think, just enjoy ...a stay to remember <3",Where to start ? If you have already read many of the other reviews you get the idea. The entire staff is very friendly service oriented with the sole intent to make your stay as easy and enjoyable as possible. If you have thought about something out loud it likely has already been put into action for you to just enjoy. You will no doubt appreciate many of the special touches they have planned for your stay.    Do take advantage of everything Dar Anika has to offer including a visit to their Sister property Riad Kaiss just a short walk away. It is all exceptionally well done. Abu & Antonio have fine tuned the experience you will have staying with them in Marrakesh wether it be for a few days or a longer stay.    Our only regret was not having more time in this wonderful city. We will definitely return.

Riad Dar Anika,kattinger wrote a review Nov 2017,40,"wonderful, quiet, centrally located",Dar Anika is at the entrance to the Medina proper but still just 20 m from a main street and can easily reached by car. The proprietor and staff are very friendly and helpful. The building is beautiful and quiet although near the busy city center. Room is comfortable and spacy enough although not huge. Construction is traditional with verandahs around a central courtyard and a very nice restaurant/bar on the roofterrace. Food is very good and the waiters are top.    Due to the traditional architecture the rooms are very dark since there are no real windows meant to give natural light.    Is it overpriced? Yes for sure but then again you do not have to worry about anything and you get great memories for your money spent.    Only point for the easily scared: the place looks a fire-trap: no windows to the outside and just one wooden staircase leading to the one small exit. If anything happens (which of course is not very probable) your chances of a safe exit are not great (as the house is built to keep chances for intruders to enter minimal).,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Vienna, Austria",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kattinger

Arranged transportation when necessary and offered to set up any tours we would like. My problem with the riad was with our room. It was very small and we had a hard time fitting both of our travel suitcases in the room. The shower did not have a door and the bathroom floor was soaked after every shower. the bed was also very firm and I found it to be uncomfortable. I also found the room to be very noisy the last night of our stay- I don't know if it was the room above us or noise from the courtyard but I was woken several times during the night.

The rooms were excellent and complimentary drinks were frequently provided when we came in hot from the medina. The roof terrace was a wonderful setting for the excellent breakfasts dinner and an afternoon drink. From arrival nothing was too much trouble and Abu gave us a really useful map tour of places to go - an enormous help on our first trip to Marrakech. The location is perfect as well with everything within walking distance. At the end of our stay we asked if there was somewhere to keep our bags because we were catching a late flight and we were told to just keep our room so we could freshen up later. Then on leaving they gave us some food for the journey and they'd even filled in our border papers to speed us through the airport.

Riad Dar Anika,vague travellers wrote a review Oct 2017,50,The Friendliest Place which helped us have an amazing experience,We knew nothing of the city and picked Dar Anika based on Tripadvisor reviews and its website. All the favourable reviews reflected our experience too.    We loved the residence and the comfortable rooms around the courtyard. Abu's explanation and suggestions around dos and don'ts in the city were invaluable as were restaurant suggestions and a great tour to the Atlas Mountains with a friendly and knowledgeable local guide. There are plenty of those tours offered around the city of course so it was good to be able to rely on Abu's suggested guide. Also when we decided not long before we left that one of our group's swollen knee meant we couldn't do the walk we had booked the hotel immediately came up with a replacement idea arranged that with the guide and took it all in their stride.    The other point we wanted to mention was the friendly and helpful service we received from everyone there no matter what their role. Their attitude really adds to the stay and we hope that we let everyone know how much we enjoyed their interactions with us.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Sydney Australia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vaguetravellers

Riad Dar Anika,Debbie H wrote a review Oct 2017,50,Dream Riad!,We had such an amazing stay here the service is really second to none and the building is so beautiful. The staff were so friendly and helpful and the manager Antonio took the time to sit down with us and let us know where to go recommended restaurants and also told us what to watch out for in the market square!    Every time we returned back we were presented with refreshing minty iced drinks and fresh fruit. The breakfast was delicious with so much food you don't need lunch and fresh bread is made in front of you by the ladies in the riad. The room itself was gorgeous and covered with rose petals and very romantic. As we left the staff even handed us filled in flight cards so we didn't have to worry at the airport and also gave us a bag of sandwiches and fruit for the plane. Such lovely touches that you just don't get at the big hotels. I would highly recommend staying here!,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debbiehR8316YB

Antonio especially was wonderful and his staff followed his lead.  Lovely comfortable rooms and perfect location within the medina ( old town)  We were allowed to use the rooftop pool in their ( very close) sister hotel which was a treat every afternoon as we ordered a cool beer to relax with. Each drink was accompanied by a dish of olives and other tasty nibbles which was most welcome.

Riad Dar Anika,RuralFoodies wrote a review Oct 2017,50,Flawless,Originally I had 4 nights booked at Dar Anika. I had read so many great things about it. From the moment I arrived at the airport their excellent customer service commenced. A lovely driver was waiting. On arrival which was early in the morning after the traditional welcome I was offered breakfast. This was very unexpected given that my check- in time was not officially until the afternoon. Then came the welcome and briefing with one of the owners-Abu. This was very helpful for me as I was travelling by myself and whilst I was excited I was also a little anxious about being in the Medina alone. However I followed all of Abu's instructions and all went well. I also tried the hammam and massage. Both wonderful experiences. After my first wonderful night at Dar Anika Abu suggested a walk over to Riad Kaiss to see their second property! Within an hour I had moved to Riad Kaiss! (See my other review on Riad Kaiss) Dar Anika was fantastic and is very deserving of its TripAdvisor status and reviews!

Riad Dar Anika,SalmaGlobelover wrote a review Sep 2017,50,It felt like home,We left Marrakech with sweet memories from Riad Dar Anika thanks to the warm welcome that the staff and the owner offered us (couple + baby). First of all the location is great: it's at the door of The Old Medina two steps far from Dar Bahia Al Bedii Palace and El fnaa big place. It is easily accessible with a baby stroller. The Riad is cosy and nice the restaurant is in the terrace on the rooftop I have enjoyed my first fish tajine there and every morning we go up to have our breakfast with fresh orange juice harira (morrocan soup) traditional bread eggs yogurt fresh fruit salad and of course a big cup of coffee to start the day. I have to mention that they served also my baby with a vegetable soup every morning.  The Riad has also its private hammam. Small yet convenient. Khmissa the lady who took care of me has magical hands. I have enjoyed a relaxing massage while Khawla the receptionnist was playing with my 7 months old baby boy.  We left the Riad this morning at 4 AM and we found the owner standing up at the door to greet us with a lunch box full of tasty fruits.

The taxis were right there so when you needed one it was easy to get. A close walk to the medina but also a lot of great shops around. We were worried about being able to use our phone but the riads wifi was never an issue and we bought a SIM card (for gps when we weren’t at the riad) from a store right across the street (which the staff informed us about). The food was VERY good! They have live music a few nights a week also during dinner which was awesome.

Riad Dar Anika,John B wrote a review Sep 2017,50,An amazing and intense experience,We chose Dar Anika on the basis of its reviews on TripAdvisor and were worried that it couldn't possibly live up to the hype. But it did and then some. Everything was seamless and flawless from arriving at the airport (the Dar Anika driver was right by the door!) to the food to the room to the location and the service. We wanted to benchmark it against some of the big flash hotels around Hivernage and these literally could have been anywhere in the world. And just huge impersonal establishments as opposed to the Dar Anika which felt like coming home very day. It's in the best location to tour from - right on the edge of the narrow streets - but not quite inside the maze meaning you can walk in or taxi out on a trip with ease.  I've stayed in a lot of decent hotels but this one is genuinely one where they actually really care that everything is as perfect as it possibly can be.  Many thanks to Abu and the whole team for an unforgettable experience - we'll be back. 11 out of 10.,Date of stay: September 2017,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z1464RSjohnb

Antonio and Clarice were so helpful with organizing my rooms and greeting us with the utmost class and service. They catered to everything my friends and I requested even running out to get Benadryl for my friend who was not feeling well. Abu the owner was a gem. He sat down with us and mapped out areas to visit and to avoid. Where else can you get an owner of a hotel to sit down and converse with guests?

It's about 10 guest rooms so let's say 15-20 guests at any one time. I bet they have more employees on duty at most times. Truly amazing! Everywhere you turn there is an employee cleaning offering to help you or whatever. When we got home my wife's first words were ""I am not ready to take care of myself."" They truly did everything during our stay. The daily breakfast is amazing. Lawson and his team are first class and will give you all the food you can eat with lots of different options! We have two gluten free eaters and one dairy free eaters in our group and they made sure every meal had a variety of foods for them. The second day Lawson brought out a PLATE FULL of gluten free options for my daughter to enjoy. Just FIRST CLASS all the way! We also had dinner at the Riad a couple of nights and it is truly spectacular to eat wonderful food under the stars with amazing service and live music. Even if one is not staying at the Riad the restaurant is open to the public and I do recommend it highly. Let me get back to Lawson. In a hotel full of amazing employees I think he might have done the most to make our stay special. I got sick one day and he brought me special tea to drink to calm my stomach. He then came back later to check on me. He even gave me some of the tea to take with me when we headed to the airport. He is a gem but like i said all the employees are excellent. Antonio the manager greets you and shows you a map of the city. Very informative and we felt no rush. He took his time to explain everything. The location of the Riad is excellent if you want to be in the Medina (the old city). It's about a 10 minute walk to the main square. A short cab ride or long walk to the new city where more modern restaurants and nightclubs are. The hotel has a very small pool which are kids enjoyed to the fullest. It's not warm but it's refreshing after a hot day. Upon checking out they even gave us sack lunches and they completed forms for customs which was nice as we didn't know they were required and we chuckled to ourselves watching people filling them out next to the line at the airport. If we go back to Marrakech we will stay at Dar Anika again for sure!",Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Las Vegas, Nevada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DodgerJohn
Riad Dar Anika,Carol A wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Amazing Riad not to be missed,From the moment we stepped inside this beautiful enchanting Riad- Full of ambiance and wonder we were overwhelmed at how wonderful every single detail was. Every member of the staff were exceptional with their service and hospitality. It was the best place we stayed in all of Morocco for a unique very special experience that we will never forget. From the initial greeting with Abu till the departure we were sad to leave. Amazing delicious food and catered to you. Excellent location as you step out the front door straight to the Medina. They can arrange your entire stay in Morocco and I highly recommend it. They know all the best places to go and see and to eat. We would definitely stay here anytime and hope we can get back soon.

Riad Dar Anika,lforster2014 wrote a review Jul 2017,50,"Amazing raid - food, service, facilities and hospitality",We only stayed for one night but the hospitality and service at this riad was outstanding. We were given complimentary mint tea pastries dates milk and cakes during our very short stay. The owner Antonio is very knowledgeable and incredibly helpful. He even provided bags and sellotape for us to wrap out newly purchased Moroccan lights in.  The rooms ( ours were the basic rooms) were fabulous and spotlessly clean.  We ate on the roof top terrace and the food and service were excellent.  If you are looking for a riad with five star service and facilities then here is a must. Another bonus is its location - it is a 10 minute walk - in a straight line to the main square. We have got lost many times around the souks in the medina trying to get back to our riad - but this time we were pleased to find it so easy.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Yorkshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lforster2014

The breakfasts are really good and we were supplied with lovely fresh drinks and fruit whenever we got back from an excursion. Very clean and comfortable room. Best of all are the staff who are very friendly and helpful and made everything easy particularly for travellers like us who were new to Morocco. It also makes arrangements for excursions; we went to the Ourika valley for the day with a very good guide.

Riad Dar Anika,kimnedra wrote a review Jun 2017,50,Beautiful & Peaceful Oasis!,My family of three (2 adults and teenager) had a marvelous three night stay here. The Riad is an elegant peaceful oasis in the perfect Medina location easy walking to several nearby historical sights the main square in the Medina and the Medina area itself. We stayed two nights in one room plenty of room with a single divan for our son and lots of wardrobe space then did a two day side trip to Ouarzazate with a driver/SUV arranged easily by reception staff (who sent us off with a lovely lunch). We returned to a different even larger room again with a nice divan for our son. The staff service and meals were excellent! Your arrival is welcomed by staff offering mint tea dates fruit and Moroccan sweets in the salon off the beautiful courtyard and upon return from ourcafternoon walks we were greeted with refreshing melon juice. The owner sat with us and a map the first day to orient us to the city the sights restaurants and areas of the Medina very helpful. We had delicious dinners on the rooftop accompanied by a classical Moroccan Oud player lovely.

The staff are extremely attentive but in no way overbearing or obtrusive and always appear at just the right time with a cold drink or light snack without ever having to ask.

At the time of booking I was considering other 5 star hotels but I was intrigued by the comments on Riad Dar Anika most of which were very complimentary (and long). These comments swayed my decisions and I opted for Riad Dar Anika.    Situated in the Medina this beautiful hotel is an oasis of calm in these hectic surroundings. I have spent time in many iconic hotels around the world but the service of the Riad Dar Anika rivals any of them.

Riad Dar Anika,Simran Jeet S wrote a review Jun 2017,50,Excellent place to stay in Marrakesh,My wife and I came to Marrakesh for our honeymoon and stayed at Riad Dar Anika. We were not entirely sure where to stay and a friend recommended Riad Dar Anika. In retrospect we are so grateful for this suggestion because we ended up staying there and absolutely loved it. It was so perfect that we actually feel like it took our honeymoon to the next level.    First of all its location is one of the prime spots in the entire city. We had easy access to the main square (jam al fana) which meant we were easily able to come and go as we liked. We really enjoyed hopping to and from the square at night which I'm not sure we would have done if we had stayed elsewhere. That itself made the trip because the spectacle of the square at night is a highlight of our time in Morocco. We were also closely located to many of the other main attractions of Marrakesh and the hotel staff helped us realize that many of the top-rated restaurants in the city were actually within walking distance.    Speaking of the hotel staff I have to say that we have never experienced such hospitality anywhere we have been. We were waited on hand and foot from the moment of our arrival to after our departure. The hotel staff greeted us with tea biscuits fruit and fresh milk by the pool as they checked us in the hotel. We asked there help in arranging a hot air balloon tour and they helped us find and book the top-rated tour in Marrakesh. They also helped us arrange hammam and massage treatments and they helped us find bike rentals as well.    Beyond hospitality the hotel manager and staff were so attentive to any problems that we might be encountering and helping to correct them. There were a couple of small glitches in our stay but the manager and staff went above and beyond to correct these. It was truly one of the best travel experiences that we've had staying at Riad Dar Anika!    We didn't realize it at the time but the restaurant at the riyadh itself is one of the most highly rated in all of Marrakesh. We enjoyed an elaborate breakfast every morning with careful service and attention from everyone in the kitchen. The food was some of the best we enjoyed in Morocco and the service was probably the best we have ever experienced. Honestly it's hard to put into words how incredible the hospitality and service was at Riyadh Dar Anika. We loved it so much that we are hoping to come back and visit. My wife and I highly recommend it and guarantee that you will have a wonderful experience.,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,New York,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simranjeetsingh
Riad Dar Anika,Simon G wrote a review May 2017,50,Boutique heaven,My wife and I stayed at Dar Anika for two nights and cannot fault the place the service or the attention to detail. We arrived delayed with no luggage after the airline lost it and had to wait another hour at the airport - despite being two hours late our transfer was still waiting for us with a big smile. On arrival we were met by the manager Antonio who was incredible. He gave us all his knowledge of the area suggested somewhere to get clothes and even offered to book restaurants. The room was lovely not huge but this riad is not about that. It's intimate but you feel like you are on your own and with only 12 rooms you almost are. The only thing I can fault was the squeaky bed frame! We had a brilliant couples hammam and one of Antonio's recommendations (Azar) was one of the best dinners ever. The riad is located in an awesome location at the entrance to the markets but not in the middle so it's nice to walk in and out.    The last finishing touch was on check out Antonio provided us with pre completed departure card which just gave us one less thing to think about doing!

Riad Dar Anika,PortolaValleyLMS wrote a review May 2017,50,The Perfect Hotel Solution for Marrakech,"The Riad Dar Anika is the perfect hotel solution for Marrakech. I generally stay in five star hotels and considered that for Marrakech. I believe that I was much better served staying in the Riad which is close to the medina and in the center of the ""action"". The hotel is clean safe and has a terrific roof garden where meals are served. We had drinks up there every evening even when we dined elsewhere.    The key to this hotel is staff. The courtesy missing from many hotel stays is clearly in evidence at this property. The manager Antonio sets the standard for courtesy caring and above and beyond customer care. I really cannot stress how Antonio made our visit to Marrakech: He spent over an hour on arrival marking walking tour routes for our two days of touring; he arranged (and it was terrific) our tour of the Atlas Mountains including the guide at whose home we had lunch; he was offended that we had a bad meal at a restaurant he endorsed and without being asked contacted them for a refund; he was present at breakfast each morning...just to make certain that the guests had no issues.

But this time around I had to pause for a minute and think to myself ""Really ???""  What should have been just another layover of 48 hours somewhat felt in the end like I had been a Sultan spun out of a Aladdin fable roaming his personal palace as he pleases unobstructed free to be exploring this dreamlike palace from Hammam to rooftop swimming pool from luxurious suite with intricate details to sipping mint tea in the lush courtyard in front of the fountaincomplete with warm service staff that actually cared about you like family almost. In fact so much so that it doesn't even feel right to refer to them as ""service staff"". Doesn't do them justice at all!!! They were more like friends. Ismail Anes were stellar dedicated and so friendly. The place is STUNNING and authentic in decoration true to its spirit of former palace down to the most minute details. I kid you not when I say that the people made us all feel like we WERE royalty there. The manager Antonio was so accommodating to our needs and I was blown away by the kindness of Abu the owner whom I hereby genuinely congratulate on behalf of my whole crew for running his ship so superbly. I congratulate all the employees who go above and beyond what's required even for a seasoned traveler... the souks and famous landmarks are literally right outside the door too.

It all started at the airport with a perfectly organized limousine transfer and went on after a short ride with a warm welcome and helpful explanations by Antonio the manager upon our arrival. Make sure to grab one of Dar Anika's well made maps as even smartphones are of little help in the narrow streets of Marrakech.  We had dinner pre-arranged at the Riad well in advance of our trip and this was a great choice as we enjoyed the lovely atmosphere on the rooftop terrace succulent food and impeccable service. After a cosy night's sleep in the perfectly quiet room we enjoyed breakfast on the terrace with home made breads fresh fruits and eggs made to order.  The Riad is in walking distance of any main attractions including the Jemmah El Fna Square. On my wife's birthday she received a charming surprise after breakfast. Everything was just perfect.

Once we stepped through the doors the noise & bustle of of the busy streets was left behind. When we arrived we were told ""this is your home"" and we were certainly treated like family rather than just guests nothing seemed to be too much trouble.    Everywhere was spotless and the service was excellent there was bottled water & fresh fruit in bowls in the rooms as well as in the public areas and very return was greeted with the offer of either a delicous fresh fruit (non alcoholic) daiquiri or mint tea. We took dinner & breakfast on the roof terrace overlooking the city the food was excellent and the service very friendly.    The air conditioning in the room was both efficient and quiet (a huge plus). Be warned as this is a traditional Dar there are no windows opening onto the street and some of the rooms are quite small although perfectly adequate for sleeeping in and the communial areas are very relaxing and peaceful to sit in.    Antonio the manager took time to advise us on how best to explore the Madina safely and at our own pace. He advised us about various exceursions both the pros and cons and again modified them to suit our needs.

The room was on the smaller side but cozy and well decorated. The restaurant menu was similarly compact but the food is good enough to compensate for any perceived lack of variety. Fair warning about taking breakfast on the rooftop terrace: you will likely be swarmed by bees.    Seriously though if you find yourself in Marrakesh you have to stay at Dar Anika.

The Medina is not that big so you can walk everywhere that you want to and this spot worked fine for getting around.  We loved the free breakfast every morning - homemade yogurt fresh fruit salad warm assortment of breads and the famous fresh-squeezed orange juice. The dinner menu is delicious as well. We ate on the roof deck 2 of the 4 nights there and loved everything we tried.  The rooms were very clean spacious and the bathrooms were large and very modern.

We tried most of the menu and every dish was a delight.    The best part of the riad is the staff. We have never met such warm welcoming and helpful staff at a hotel before.

Dinner time is so romantic on the terrace with live music & the tajines are out of this world  I was also so glad that they have argeela (shisha or hookah).. it's not available everywhere like in Lebanon or Egypt so it was a relief to know that they have that too..  When you come back to your room you find complementary bottle of water milk dates and traditional cookies..what more can you ask for!  They really treat you as family...& I chose this title for my review because I think it best explains how well you are treated from each and every member  There is really nothing bad that can be said about this hotel so if you want to stay in the Medina this is the place to choose  It's amazing how you literally enter another world the minute they open the door for you..

Riad Dar Anika,Kate13d wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Best Riad ever!,The Riad Dar Anika was a beautiful place to stay. The decor is gorgeous the rooms are spacious and the staff is beyond compare.  Everything we needed or wanted was taken care of. Day trips were arranged in our behalf by Antonio including all transportation. The sister Riad to this one has a very nice hammam and spa where we enjoyed a couples hammam followed by a swim on the rooftop pool for my boyfriend and a massage for me.  The staff at the Riad Dar Anika were attentive thoughtful knowledgeable and kind. Restaurants were recommended even reservations were taken care of!

The staff was very welcoming and breakfast on the terrace was a treat. The morning we checked out with a day of driving ahead of us they packed a lunch for each of us and filled out our travel cards for our return flight home. Such attention to detail! And the riad was located just at the edge of the medina so it was easy to explore in all directions. My roomie and I laughed each night when we returned to our room and had to pick up rose petals from just about every surface!

Staff was so thoughtful and looked out for me (as a solo traveler that meant a lot). They noticed when I came in and out knew me by name and always asked (unobtrusively) where I was going and when I expected to be back. I was there on my birthday -- they baked a cake for me and sang happy birthday at dinner. When I left for the airport at the end of the week they had packed a couple sandwiches and some fruit in case I got hungry on the flight home.

Riad Dar Anika,Tony W wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Highly recommended,My partner and I had never visited Marrakesh before and we didn't really know what to expect. The city is very different from Europe and so we made our hotel selection based on the reviews written on this page.    On first approaching the Riad nothing about it stands out. Just a door in a wall. However when the door was opened it was obvious that we had arrived at a very special place.    We were greeted by the friendly staff and given fresh tea juice and snacks as we sat in the small well decorated lounge. The atmosphere immediately indicated that nothing had been left to chance in relation to ambiance.    Our host manager Antonio explained all we needed to know about to the Riad and gave us very useful information regarding the local area.    Our room on the first floor was well appointed immaculately clean and very comfortable.    Breakfast served on the roof terrace overlooking the Medina was a delight. Freshly prepared local food efficiently served by attentive staff.    We availed ourselves of Hammam on two occasions one of which included a massage. This was an amazing experience and should not be missed.    Dinner was available on the roof terrace. A well thought out menu of locally sourced dishes and a good wine list made up of selected Moroccan wines. We ate dinner twice during our four night stay. Both meals were excellent as was the service.    Nothing was too much trouble for the staff who were very polite friendly and efficient. I mention in particular Aziz who cleverly anticipated our requirements for superbly prepared gin and tonics as the sun went down!    Antonio and his team worked tirelessly to make our stay very special.    Excellent.

Riad Dar Anika,Nikki A wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Best Riad!,My friend and I (both Americans in our mid-20s) stayed here for 4 nights and could not have had a better experience. As an avid traveler I have never and will probably never experience such high quality customer service. The staff was impeccably trained and attentive. There is nothing this Riad didn't think of when it came to the comfort and happiness of their guests.    As two young girls traveling alone safety was obviously a major concern for us however Dar Anika made sure we were either escorted everywhere or knew the best routes and times to travel and explore.    The manager met with us upon or arrival and helped us plan our trip and book excursions (I highly recommend the hike in the Atlas Mountains and camel excursions). Everything was so easy and the trips were fantastic! They even booked all of our restaurant reservations and gave the best recommendations for lunch and dinner!    Dar Anika had every amenity you could hope for in a Riad and they were all beautiful and functional. The Riad even has an on-site hammam which was such an interesting and authentic experience!    Quite possibly the hardest part of leaving Dar Anika was saying goodbye to the staff members who were such an integral part of our experience in Marrakech and made us feel like family!,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nwa610

I truly am certain I will not see another place up to this standard in my lifetime. Upon arrival we were greeted with fresh juice and a sit-down with the manager who gave us a run-down of the city the Riad and helped us plan our itinerary. Everyone who works at the Riad is amazing and friendly going above and beyond to make our stay incredible. Not only was it sad to leave Marrakech but it was sad to leave all of the people we had met and stayed with at the Riad. Customer service is absolutely excellent they are always thinking of the little things that make such an improvement to the day. Beautiful space and beautiful people - this is where you want to stay to get a true and real experience of the Medina!! Definitely go on the hike to the Atlas mountains and explore Berber culture.

Riad Dar Anika,peas_everywhere wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Perfect Stay!,Thank you Antonio and the staff for my unforgettable trip in Morocco.    Words cannot express how lovely our stay was. Here were a few of my favorite things about Dar Anika:    1- The breakfast. On the BEAUTIFUL rooftop. It was a delicious feast every morning. The fresh squeezed orange juice!!! Being able to watch your bread get made. The wonderful attentive staff... I happen to go for my birthday and they all came out singing for me...with a cake! This was not even a request from my boyfriend they did it on their own. Seriously I can't describe the level of service here -- unbeatable    2- The welcome process - mint tea? check. delicious green basil smoothie?? i dont even know what it was but it was most refreshing drink i have ever tasted. Antonio also sat us down and walked us through the map. He was so thorough and helpful!    3- Hamman - I can't compare this to another hamman experience in Morocco but here you are scrubbed in a private room by a lady. If you want the authentic experience of being handled in public this is not it.    4 - Beautiful rooms w/ rose petals :) so romantic.    I have to go back to the service... when we left the hotel (rather unwillingly) they sent us off with packed sandwiches and drinks because they knew we were going into the desert. I MEAN!!!!! Words cannot even describe the gratitude.    Dar Anika hands down had the best service of any accommodation in all of my travels and I recommend anybody and everybody to stay here to experience it yourself!,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peas_everywhere

Riad Dar Anika,Anna_Louise_123 wrote a review Apr 2017,50,The perfect place to stay in Marrakech,My partner and I stayed in four different riad's during our long stay in Marrakech and both of us agreed that Riad Dar Anika was the best all round place to stay. This was based on the unbeatable location the amazingly welcoming staff and the comfortable well equipped room and great nights sleeps that we had there. In addition I feel it is very important to say that if I were travelling to Marrakech as a woman on my own I would definitely choose to stay in Riad Dar Anika again because unlike many other riads there are several routes to choose to walk home at night which are safe and do not involve walking down the empty narrow passages in the dark which at night can be a little intimidating. The location really is the best you could wish for in this respect.  Returning to Riad Dar Anika after a busy day exploring Marrakech felt like coming home and instantly you felt relaxed and so well looked after. The hotel staff really are wonderful the service we received was above and beyond anything you could hope for. On arrival (following their excellently organised airport pick up) the manager sat with us and explained the map of the city what were the best things to see how much you could expect to pay for taxis and other useful tips. The reception staff also completed the departure form for us for our flight out of Marrakech and on check out provided us with the most delicious (complimentary) pack lunch for the journey.  The food at the riad was probably the best meal that we had during our entire stay in Marrakech and incredibly good value for money considering how tasty it was and how many courses it involved! The riad roof top area was a wonderful spot to relax and watch the world go by and the breakfasts that are served up there every morning were wonderful.  In summary Riad Dar Anika has everything you could want for an amazing stay in Marrakech. It is 10 - 15 minutes pleasant walk from all of the sights it is a beautiful place to sit and relax and you feel so welcome that you feel like part of the family. I could not recommend it more highly and would not hesitate to stay here again on my next visit to Marrakech.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anna_Louise_123

Before we checked out we were given pre-written departure cards (which was super considerate and saved us a lot of trouble!) and a bag packed with sandwiches and fruits for our trip. Of all our times traveling in different places not any one of them had this type of service.

Riad Dar Anika,Mrvdo wrote a review Mar 2017,50,"family of four, 2 nights Marrakech",The Riad is conveniently located just 10 minutes from the main square in the Medina. The walk to the Medina is a straight walk through the Souks. The Ambiance is tranquil and the rooms are comfortable. The roof top terrace is Perfect to watch the sun go down or to eat a hearty breakfast in the morning and hear the streets wake up for a day's work.  We were greeted by the staff who collected the bags from our Taxi and walked 50 yards to the front top the Raid's deceiving entrance way - opening to a breathtaking lobby/dining area with a pool.    Please do not except wide open spaces - the use of space is well thought out and quite adequate. We were a family of 4 with 2 teenagers and had 2 rooms - we had everything we needed.    I have to say that if you like being pampered there can't be a better place to stay in Marrakech from the owners to all the staff - they are there to welcome you and make your stay comfortable. I can only recall a few hotels in the world that are so fastidious about this.    When Abu- one of the 2 owners/Brothers sat down to welcome me to their Riad - I have to say he was modest and undersold the Dinner choice and so we ate out the first night - big mistake!. The second night we decided to stay in and enjoy the place as we were leaving to catch a flight in the morning and didn't want to get to get tired walking. I have to say the meal was amazing - we all thought so. If only I had known how good the food is here. You will find other people coming in for dinner to eat here - so that confirmed my suspicion. Try the Chicken Seffa Medfouna - divine!.    I have to give the owners and staff a big hand for making this place so memorable. They outdid themselves and my family and I will always remember their graciousness.    FYI - They also have a sister property only 5 minutes walk from here that they just opened called Raid Kaiss - beautiful and we checked it out and had a drink there. It is old world style in al its grandeur. If you intend on staying several days in Marrakech - do yourself a favor and split it between these 2 properties and get pampered to your delights.  I also forgot to tell you that my son wasn't feeling well one morning and the Owner - Abu walked with me to the Pharmacy to get medicine - amazing!! ( The owners brothers engineers non-hoteliers are there almost all the time and both are called Abu). My Son is only14 but they checked on him and catered to him when he felt better while we were out in the Souks shopping - that is how comfortable we were in leaving him there on his own. This says a lot about the level of service and comfort they provide in making you feel welcome.  Thank you guys for making this stay so lovely for our family I can't thank you enough.    I saw the reviews on Trip advisor and booked this place on a hunch and it paid out - big time.

When we arrived we were served mint tea dates and cakes. The rooms are small but adequately sized. However they are finished to a very high standard and decorated in scented rose petals daily. The staff were happy to bring a bottle of wine to the roof terrace for us to enjoy the sunset before dinner. As for food you will not go hungry.

Attention for the staff and the manager is the best asset of this small lovely and authentic riad. It also boosts a nice decor. Breakfast (especially at the roof top) is very nice. But the rooms are too tiny (there is no space for properly opening a medium/big luggage) bad acoustic (you can easily hear sounds from outside) and does not have tv or stereo. Amenities (shampoo etc.) are nothing special. And rates are too much pricey.

Riad Kaiss is unbelievably beautiful and so well managed. Valentino greeted us there with even more hospitality.

Riad Dar Anika,Lisa D wrote a review Mar 2017,50,Wonderful and extraordinary in every way!,We chose Riad Dar Anika because of its brilliant reviews and we're thrilled to report that yes this beautiful riad really is as special as guests claim it is. Having reviewed dozens of hotels spanning five continents I can say with conviction that I have never experienced such incredible guest services -- and it's totally sincere. Every member of the team cares deeply about the comfort of every guest. A few examples of many: Larsen arranged to have the figs we bought at the market cleaned prepared and wrapped for us. Antonio who brilliantly manages the team followed our car on his motorbike after we checked out to return two small items we'd left behind. It's gestures like these that allow us to call Riad Dar Anika one of the best hotels we have ever stayed at.  Our room was beautiful and we enjoyed the daily display of rose petals and delicious cookies and fruit in our room. The riad's hammam was a welcome treat - if not a necessity- after a long journey and the massage that followed was perfect.  We had dinner at the hotel every night and loved each selection. Breakfast on the rooftop dining area was a great way to begin the day.  There's no better place to stay in Marrakech - or beyond.

Riad Dar Anika,Justina I wrote a review Mar 2017,50,Highest level of service I ever came across,Went to Marrakech as my birthday trip. It was the first time there and found it difficult to choose whether to stay in the Medina (old town) or in the modern part. I choose the authentic old town experience and found this boutique Riad with 9.8 rating on booking.com not even knowing what a Riad actually is :) long story short the moment we got there we stepped into a 1001 nights type of experience! I can seriously not emphasize enough how romantic and beautiful this boutique hotel is. The care they gave us is unheard of. They were so considerate from: receiving a detailed explanation of all there is (worth!) to see in the city to unlimited delicious fruits and fully personalized breakfast menu (even for me as a vegetarian) to daily new rose petals all over the room free of charge ironing service amazing hammam treatment reservations at the best restaurants including private drivers taking us back and forth and receiving a generous lunch box take-away when we left to the airport. They made my birthday unforgettable by both surprising me at breakfast with flowers and cake as well as arranging the restaurant employees in the evening to sing for me (without me knowing) and then again a bottle of champaign with candles ones we returned during the night! I wish I could post the videos to really show the amazing atmosphere! We saw the owner there daily talking genuinely taking interest in every guest and Antonio the manager takes personally care of everyones need. I recommend Riad Dar Anika with all my heart and can't wait to return! Oh by the way although it is really a luxurious place and we felt like royals - the final bill for being taken daily by the driver hammam for two people and all the consumption in the hotel was less than 90E!,Date of stay: January 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/894justinai
Riad Dar Anika,Galayna wrote a review Mar 2017,50,Best riad in Morocco,A beautiful Riad with service which could not have been better real first class service. The manager Anthonia greeted us when we first arrived and we were served with Moroccon tea and sweets. He helped us by providing his suggestions and recommendation on the things to do in Marrakech.The staff in the riad was absolutely helpful and friendly. The room was beautifully decorated Moroccan style. We also had a hammam at the riad and it was a lovely experience. I think it was also very sweet that Anthonia and his team made us sandwiches for our flight back to the UK. Thank you for your hospitality and generosity Anthonia and team.

Riad Dar Anika,niallw67 wrote a review Mar 2017,50,Fabulous,Just returned from 4 night stay at riad anika. It was my wife's birthday so really wanted to have a special trip for her. The riad is everything and more than we expected after reading all the previous reviews. The staff are so attentive and there is always someone nearby to offer tea or a snack which we found at the end were complementary which was an added bonus. Antonio is great at explaining what to do and to make sure the stay went well. We had a lovely meal at the hotel on the first night and all the staff came out to sing happy birthday with a cake and flowers for my wife - it was fab. Can't fault the hotel in any way it really was 5 star. We also did the day trip to the mountains which was pricey but a lovely break from the madness of the city. Hassan is a great guide and we really enjoyed experiencing a window into Berber life in the mountains. It felt very genuine and not contrived for tourists.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/niallw67

After reading the glowing reviews beforehand I must say this place lived up to my expectations. Hind was a star was always at the end of an email for any queries I had arranged the private transfers from the airport dinner reservations etc. All of the staff (special mention to Mohammed) here go out of their way to help and nothing is too much trouble. I booked the special weekend stay and or room dinner and Hamman were perfect.    Upon arrival Antonio sat down and with us to give us the low down on the local area. Thank you Antonio!    We we're treated to over 2 hours of the most amazing hammam and massage I have ever had at Dar Anika's sister hotel Riad Kai's - this Riad appear equally luxurious and again the service from the staff there was faultless.

Riad Dar Anika,Seals36 wrote a review Feb 2017,50,A real find for lunch or dinner!,This gorgeous little riad and restaurant is situated very close to the Bahia Palace. My colleagues and I had dinner here on our penultimate night in Marrakech and liked it so much we came back for lunch on their beautiful terrace the following day; a week later I brought two colleagues from Casablanca to enjoy the riad at lunch time!  At night they had a very welcoming fire to help stave off the January cold. We ate well and enjoyed a nice bottle of wine between us. We were offered lots of little complimentary extras such as olives mint tea soup and bread. There was some unobtrusive but lovely live music all adding to the ambiance.  I will definitely be coming back here on my next trip to Morocco. Also worth checking out is their sister riad Riad Kaiss recently renovated and situated in the middle of the Medina; we were lucky to get a guided tour and it too is gorgeous!,Date of stay: January 2017,Trip type: Traveled on business,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seals36
Riad Dar Anika,Julie M wrote a review Feb 2017,50,Big recommendation from Denmark,We had 6 fantastics nights at Riad Dar Anika. Everyone was extremely welcoming towards us and did their utmost to make us feel comfortable. They were all very helpful but not in a distant way - we felt we met some really nice people!  The Riad is really like the pictures shows - we were in no way disappointed! Charming decoration and the roof-top terrace was perfect for breakfast and for relaxing after a long day in the buzzing city. Everytime we came home only a few minutes passed before someone knocked on the door with a fresh orange juice or mint tea with small local cakes.  The food was no less than amazing (I had a fantastic chicken dish that I can't remember the name of)! I would recommend to save the meal(s) at the Riad for the last days in the city as we really found it much better than most of the food in the city.  Lastly the Riad is located about 10 minutes walk away from the big square and the souks which I consider a BIG plus as people pretty much left us alone in that area of the city. It was very nice to have a few minutes to mentally prepare for the buzz inside the city :)  Big big thank you to Antionio for the fantastic welcome Larsen for taking so good care of us at breakfast (don't know how the name is spelled) and the rest of the team for being so nice!

The ambiance was great especially at night when the musicians played their traditional music and you could see over all the hotel residents. We didn’t get to eat at the hotel due to lack of time but the smell of the food was quite tempting.  We plan to go back in a few months and will booking directly with the hotel.

A very warm welcome from our favorite chap Lahcen who literally was the most helpful person 🤗- we were brought a number of local treats milk dates mint tea.  The central area to chill out in is stunning. Then we rested on the sunny roof terrace to relax on the sun beds.  The room was lovely ... and a beautiful touch with flower petals everywhere.  We additionally went to the sister riad just round the corner with a pool & bed to sun yourself on a bottle of champagne up there was a real treat.  The markets are on the door step and a short walk up to the main square (15 mins).  Antonio recommended we get a driver for the evening and we are glad we did (lift to bar Marmounia which again I recommend ( probably spelt wrong)).  Breakfast on the roof was ideal breakfast served from 8am until whenever you want it - great attitude!  Lastly we enjoyed a Hammam at the sister riad wasn't sure what to expect - enjoyed it - lady very professional & skin feels amazing.

However it's the service that makes this place outstanding:  - Served breakfast when we arrived despite not staying the night before  - Sit down with Antonio (the manager) to discuss what we wanted to do each day offer advice and even take care of the bookings  - Special gluten free baking to accommodate our dietary restrictions  - Milk and a moroccan treat served in the room each night  - A special anniversary cake and song  - Orange juice in the room while packing  - Pre-filled in departure cards and sandwiches for the plane    Every individual went above and beyond to make this stay as special as possible.

We all were busy taking pictures of the riad can't describe the inner joy we had! Staff were so professional and friendly we've immediately felt welcomed and our home!    Hotel manager Antonio a real gentleman welcomed us and gave us a detailed overview on the city. It was very informative being the first time in the city.    Then we were taken to our rooms rooms were cosy and very well maintained.    Toilet was good size and water pressure was perfect!    The breakfast was the best I ever had! Seriously the BEST! Bread freshly baked different selection of eggs jam yogurt and fruits!    We have also enjoyed dinner the food was tasty and I'd really hope more option will be added to the menu.    The gentlemen looking after the breakfast and dinner were so friendly and prompt.    House keeping was great I honestly felt to relaxed for the hygiene and Tidiness.    The last nigh there was a night show (shaikhat) and it was amazing.    Location was great right on bab el mella and it's 7/10 min walk to Jama l'efna.

Close to all the main attractions in the Medina not far from the main square and hosted by some of the most courteous and helpful staff we have ever encountered.    The owner Abu got our 4-night visit off to a great start by telling us where to go and perhaps more importantly where not to go/what not to do - tip no. 1 don't buy anything on your first day in the souks!    The food was wonderful. Fresh fruit in the bedroom every day and many thanks to Lahcan and his team for the wonderful breakfasts in particular. What can we add about the cakes we were presented with on our birthdays? Fabulous! Never had ""Happy Birthday"" sung to us in three different languages before either so made for a couple of very special days in the middle of our trip.    We visited the nearby Riad Kaiss for a hammam on our last day. Another treat in the larger but equally stunning sister hotel to Dar Anika so if you are unable to get a room at Anika you can't go wrong with Kaiss either. The delightful Valentina will show you around.    Finally a big thank you to the staff for arranging a trek in the foothills of the Atlas mountains with our guide Hassan.

Riad Dar Anika,dubaijess wrote a review Feb 2017,50,Amazing!,‘Riad Dar Anika’ – owned by Abu managed by Antonio and run by exceptionally gracious and polite staff. My wife and I (along with our unborn baby boy) had an amazing time in Marrakech and this was almost entirely as a result of the guidance and support of our hosts. The food was excellent the rooms were comfortable and homely and the attention to our needs were met on every opportunity and level. This simply is good business we are absolutely going to return the to Riad Dar Anika and we’ll bring friends and family with us.    The madness and chaos of the Souks is something to behold in Marrakech and I whole-heartedly enjoy immersing myself in the sordid undertaking that is haggling – “8000DHS for a lamp get out of here!!”……”but it is the finest quality sir look crafted by the hand of the pope”….”350DHS”……”You insult me Sir this that is not even 5% of the price”…….. “What price you mean the one you’ve made up to fleece me?”….loved it. Then remove and cleanse yourself in the form of a Hamann highly recommended if you stay at the Riad Dar Anika.    This Riad has a great roof-top area as well where you can either sun-bath eat & drink or just absorb the atmosphere there - the noises are great the occasional donkey beeping mopeds and prayer time add to the experience and all in a pleasant way.

Riad Dar Anika,Kathryn P wrote a review Jan 2017,50,Perfect Honeymoon Stay in Marrakech!,From the moment we were greeted at the airport to the sack lunches that were packed for us for our bus ride this place made you feel like royalty. Even when we booked our stay at this riad they immediately followed up by sending over about 8-10 documents for you to read through. The riad staff is wonderful and happy to help you book any part of your trip!    Upon arriving at the riad they immediately escorted us into a salon and brought us milk and dates. Once they found out that we had not eaten yet that day they took us to the terrace and fed us the most amazing breakfast spread. After breakfast the manager Antonio briefed us about Marrakech with a map and then showed us to our room.    Our room was lovely and in good condition. It was perfectly large enough for two of us. They provided water and snacks/fruit. They would even bring by milk and dates in the evening.    The riad booked for us a tour guide Saad who was wonderful. He took us around Marrakech for a little over 7 hours. I would definitely recommend for your first trip to Marrakech to get to see all of the sites.    We also took advantage of the spa at the riad. We booked a couples hamman and followed up with a massage. The services were wonderful! We would highly recommend.    Larsen and his dining staff were fabulous and the food was delicious! We ate breakfast like kings daily. The only thing you order is how you would like your eggs prepared and what hot drink you want. And then mounds of food would appear before your eyes. It was all so good. And they cook the pancakes and breads right in front of you. We even had lunch at the riad one day and everything was delicious. All of the meals can be served on the terrace which luckily we had great weather every day.    This riad would do anything - make reservations schedule a car transfer for you and they even filled out the customs form for us to leave Morocco.    It was also located in a perfect place in the city. Very convenient to get in a cab and hop around the city. It was also a very easy walk to get to the souks.    This was our third hotel on our honeymoon and it was our favorite place that we stayed!

Everyone on the staff from Mr Antonio the manager to the receptionists waiters and cleaning staff go out of their way to make sure you are having a good time and to suggest things you might do to explore Marrakech or beyond.  The hotel itself is very comfortable. For us the best part is the terrace on the roof from which you can feel and see the hustle and bustle of the medina around you.

Also no provisions were made for you to sit around it.  Wonderful staff great welcome and conveniently located near to the Square.  Food was great but ate out mostly.

Riad Dar Anika,turtlegrl17 wrote a review Jan 2017,50,Fabulous stay,This was our first visit to Morocco and it was a wonderful culture shock for us. When we arrived I wasn't sure we were at a hotel- it has an unassuming entrance in the middle of chaos. Once inside Abu and Antonio and their wonderful staff guided us and cared for us-handling every detail of our visit. We were welcomed with mint tea and traditional milk and local treats. Our room was huge and beautiful their food was delicious. We ate on the rooftop terrace for both dinner and breakfast where they had an artisan making homemade breads. My husband was in heaven. I am gluten intolerant and when they found out they brought me delicious bread also. It is close to the market with the snake charmers monkeys and the unique things you find in Morocco. The staff was friendly and well trained. We had a wonderful time.,Date of stay: January 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Jacksonville, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/turtlegrl17
Riad Dar Anika,Fiona J wrote a review Jan 2017,50,A 5 star experience that makes you feel like a family friend relaxing in a luxurious home,This was our first trip to Morocco and we had no expectations. But Dar Anika has set the bar so high we will find it hard to match. Arriving tired and late at night after a 2 day commute from Australia we were warmly welcomed by Antonio and his staff. Nothing was too hard to arrange - airport pickup meant a smooth car ride straight to the hotel on entry we were welcomed by Antonio and given a comprehensive idea of the location suggestions and advice for places to visit over the next few days and commonsense tourist advice about moving around Marrakech. Phone cards organising access to an ATM to get local currency without the airport markup [1min walk from the hotel] and a late notice dinner on the rooftop terrace just seemed to happen.  The hotel grounds and rooms are even better than they appear in photos [both professional and trip advisor traveller] and it is the attention to detail in both use of materials and furnishings that really makes this special. While it is definitely a hotel it has the feel of a luxurious family house. The rooms all open onto a central courtyard but were very quiet and private. Yes you would wake to the 5.30am call to prayer but that was just an opportunity to get fabulous shots of the sunrise over the Atlas mountains from the rooftop terrace or to roll over and go back to sleep.  So no review of Dar Anika would be complete without mention of Larssen and his epic breakfasts and the wonderful experience of the in house Hamman spa. As seasoned travelers we know well the advantages of using the breakfast included in the room price to offset the need for lunch and snacks. however we were never going to be prepared for the wealth of choice we were served up every day. This included soup yogurt both traditional moroccan and french pancakes egg dishes fresh fruit and unlimited barista coffee.  The Hamman spa was also a special experience. We were able to do this as a couple in a heated room within the hotel. It was so easy to get into our swimming things and dressing gowns then walk downstairs straight to the spa. When finished you are dripping wet but glowing and the short walk straight back to the room is ideal.  Finally the location of Dar Anika is ideal. The walk to the main square and souks is an easy 15 minute walk. If you don't want to go far for a meal there is a modern square across from the hotel that has several restaurants within 1 minute walk. You can eat at the hotel and order wine from the house menu. To access most tourist attractions you will find they are within walking distance or a short taxi ride.  Would we stay here again.... in a heartbeat!,Date of stay: December 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Brisbane, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fionaj658

Riad Dar Anika,Andy M wrote a review Dec 2016,50,Beyond expectations!,Stayed for 4 nights in October 2016. We were totally blown away on arrival the welcome & the Riad itself were beyond our expectations. The photographs don't do it justice as they can't portray the warmth of the staff & the calmness of the Riad enough. The high standards & attention to detail made our stay in a city full of hustle & bustle so relaxing. Antonio & his staff were so helpful & attentive yet unobtrusive. Breakfast or evening meal on the terrace is a real treat. Location is perfect to explore the 'experience' of Marrakech being close enough to walk to all the main sites but far enough out of the mesmerising circus of experiences that is the old town.  Don't be daunted by walking the streets & souks although it may feel out of your comfort zone. We downloaded a map of Marrakech on the 'Ulmon' app which kept us on track.  We would recommend a trip to the Atlas Mountains with a Berber guide. Antonio arranged this for us & our guide Hussain was really friendly chatty & gave great insights into his way of life. Taking Mint Tea & Lunch in his home was a great privilege & experience.  Marrakech is a great experience for a totally different city break.  We wouldn't hesitate in staying in the Riad Dar Anika again & would recommend you put it on your bucket list.  Thankyou to Antonio & all staff for a wonderful experience on many levels.

Riad Dar Anika,skczec wrote a review Dec 2016,50,Like an oasis!,We stayed at Dar Anika for 3 nights at the end of our vacation. It is NOT to be confused with Csar Anika which is nearby. Dar Anika is managed by Antonio who greeted us (with tea of course) and sat down with us and gave us an overview of the city of Marrakech. He recommended restaurants (which were all fabulous) and even sent us off to the airport with a care package. He arranged an evening car ride to a restaurant when he thought getting a taxi woud be difficult or unsafe. We loved breakfast up on the roof terrace and even did afternoon tea up there. The riad setting is so much more unique and authentic than a stay at a hotel in Morocco. The staff made us feel like we were VIPs from start to finish.

Riad Dar Anika,AlexH2801 wrote a review Dec 2016,50,What a lovely riad,I've never felt so looked-after on a holiday. All the staff are so focused on making sure you have a brilliant stay. Wish we could have stayed for longer than 4 nights!    Abu (the owner) gave us lots of useful information and recommendations at the beginning of our stay and made sure we knew where we were going each day. He gave us lots of restaurant recommendations too without hard-selling the riad's restaurant - which we discovered serves delicious food and is lit up beautifully in the evenings.    Breakfast was a great start to each day with friendly and attentive Lahcen looking after us exceptionally well. Freshly squeezed orange juice tasty Moroccan pancakes and eggs and coffee to order helped to ensure I've returned from holiday a kilogram heavier. Eating on the sun terrace was also a treat with views accross Marrakech and little sparrows hoping to share breakfast with us. We were also given dates and milk when returning to the riad in the evening more freshly squeezed orange juice in the day (thanks again Lahcen) and lots of complimentary fruit and Moroccan biscuits.    The riad itself is beautifully decorated and is impeccably clean. There is a very cosy lounge off the atrium too for relaxing with some mint tea after an evening out or an afternoon in the souks. The room was perfect: very spacious a large comfy bed and a powerful shower. All decorated lovingly with rose petals! Location is great: the riad is 5mins brisk walk from the main square so it is easy to get around.    We also had hammam and massage at the riad which was a great experience very relaxing.    On departing we got given a packed lunch for our journey home a lovely touch.    Thanks to all the staff for making our holiday so special.

This is a typical ‘stress-free’ holiday (as they should be) - all you have to do is get on a plane and arrive to the airport of Marrakech..... From there you are looked after every single way imaginable from ‘A - Z and al with outstanding service and friendliness.

Riad Dar Anika,Luis C wrote a review Dec 2016,50,Our Amazing experience at Riad Dar Anika!,This Riad is truly a gem in the middle of Marrakech. There are many compliments we could give to this riad and all the wonderful people who work there. First of all the level of service is like no other the staff and management treat you like family and they attend to your every need. We had a complicated experience with missed flight connections and our baggage not arriving with us to Marrakech. We were tired and stressed out and being so far from home without our possessions did not help. Nonetheless Antonio and the staff did everything to assure us and comfort us during our unease. The staff took care of locating our bags and communicating with us any updates. Antonio even personally drove us to the airport to pick up our bags. These are the details that make this Riad and its employees so special. This level of attention is given to every detail including welcoming you with tea and snacks offering complementary fresh juices and fruits throughout your stay and even providing one with a lunch pack meal for the departure. The comforts and services of this amazing riad are 5 star. The meal options were some of the best we had throughout our trip in Africa and Europe. The rooftop and all its comforts were an excellent place to start and end our adventures throughout the city. The staff was very attentive and always concerned about comfort and needs. The riad itself is an oasis in the middle of the chaos of the medina. We can honestly say that without our stay at Dar Anika this trip would not have been the same.

Riad Dar Anika,Kayvon G wrote a review Dec 2016,50,The most hospitality I've ever received anywhere!,I went on a mini tour of Morocco with my father and brother for a week. We stayed at various Riad's (old family homes that have been renovated and converted into essentially bed and breakfast hotels) along the way in Rabat Fes and finally in Marrakesh. We were frankly blown out of the water with how excellent the service was. We felt as though we were treated with the same hospitality we would receive if we were family.    We were immediately greeted upon arrival with tea snacks and water. We told them last minute that we were hungry and they were able to whip up an amazing lamb shoulder meal at the drop of a hat. Antonio met with us and was thorough with respect to what we should do with our time there and gave us several pointers about the city. All members of the staff were exceptionally warm and friendly at all times. One in particular Larsen was very gregarious and amicable. When we were ready to leave they helped arrange transportation to the train station and even offered to purchase tickets on our behalf. We were given goodie-bags with some snacks for our travels and they even went so far as to fill out as much of the airport forms for departure as they could. They are extremely deliberate about paying attention to detail about even the smallest of things - we were all extremely impressed.

Riad Dar Anika,Melissa_H687 wrote a review Dec 2016,50,OUTSTANDING Service!!!,My husband and I have often talked about visiting Morocco and after doing some homework we decided that we must stay in the Medina. Further research lead us to Riad Dar Anika and I am so pleased that we stayed here. The service is OUTSTANDING! the hote/riad is very beautiful inside very clean and fresh. The atmosphere is relaxing and pleasant. We selected a room on the ground floor and found it to be very private good shower firm mattress fridge nice linens bathrobes slippers room safe hair dyer and daily treats - cookies fruit etc delivered to our room.  each morning we enjoyed breakfast on the rooftop terrace and in the evenings a glass of wine and snacks downstairs. We were celebrating our anniversary and they surprised us with a song and large bouquet of roses at breakfast. The food was very good and they have a generous menu. If you are visiting Morocco you must stay here have a meal here enjoy some time out upstairs in the afternoon and you MUST sign up for Hammam - wow that was the bath of a lifetime. Seriously I was so pleased and exfoliated! LOL. Ladies bring your bikini bottoms - that is all you need to wear (you can wear your bathrobe to the bath). My husband and I took swim suits and I ditched the top when I realized it was truly a bath and not just random soaking in a tub and sitting in a sauna. You will not regret the bath.  We also signed up for the walking tour - I strongly recommend this. Navigating the Souks alone can be daunting. The salespeople are quite aggressive. the guide took us through the souks and we also visited the secret garden and palace and several other areas - well worth it. on day two we went to the new town area. we felt very safe and found a nice place to eat lunch. I have to say much of our success was due to the great advice and map that Antonio the proprietor at Riad Dar Anika provided. I cannot tell you how happy we were to spend our time off here. it was wonderful. then as we were leaving they sent us off to the airport with a gift of sandwiches and fruit for lunch.

The place is beautiful the rooms are very comfortable the staff was an absolute pleasure. From the outside you may be underwhelmed at first but will be absolutely impressed after going in and it all adds to the experience of visiting Marrakech.  Antonio and Fadwa would do anything to make your stay comfortable but what impressed me most is that this attitude was passed along to everyone of the staff working at this Riad! This is something that is very hard to accomplish in customer service.  We really liked sitting up top and having breakfast also just having a glass of wine in the lounge downstairs next to the fireplace. They had no problems with our flights arriving early and had our room ready.  Also had the couples Hamman experience and would do that again.

Riad Dar Anika,GrumpyOldBeak wrote a review Dec 2016,50,Perfectly attentive service,If you love perfectly attentive service then the Riad dar Anika is for you. It’s situated in the heart of the medina and its insignificant front door hides the luxury that lies beyond. Antonio the general manager personally greets his guests and gives a comprehensive orietation of how to get the best out of your visit. He highlights the must-sees on the map and gives you an insight into local culture including those often senstive topics of tipping and taxis. From there on his super-friendly staff continue the theme. Nothing is too much trouble even down to details such as confirming your return flights and printing your boarding passes (a thoughtful touch was being provided with a fully-completed embarkation card to save time at the airport). Throughout our stay the attentive service never felt over-the-top and nor did we ever feel we were being pushed into ordering drinks etc. One word of warning. The breakfasts served where possible on the open air terrace are comprehensive; it would be easy to go home with a few extra pounds around your waist. The Riad dar Anika will certainly be our choice on any future visit and we are grateful to our personal travel consultant for recommending it.,Date of stay: November 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Norwich,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrumpyOldBeak

Riad Dar Anika,rjernigan2010 wrote a review Nov 2016,50,MUST STAY HERE!!!,My husband and I visited Marrakech Morocco for the first time last week (Nov. 19-25 2016) and we spent the trip at Dar Anika. This riad is the epitome of excellence. I think I sent a dozen emails in the weeks leading up to the trip asking questions and arranging things and each email was responded to quickly. Upon arriving at the airport the driver greeted us at the door and drove a very nice crossover vehicle to the riad where we were met by the staff who took our bags and guided us inside. The riad is located on a busy traffic square so a lot is going on and it is very intriguing. We were given dates and milk and mint tea within minutes of arriving and then we met with Antonio the riad manager who went over details about the city including safety and made sure we were planning to make the most of our trip including suggesting excursions and riad services but with NO PRESSURE; he simply told us what was available and left it at that. We stayed in room 6. It was beautiful and clean and very quiet. It is an oasis from the busy city outside. Breakfast lunch and dinner are absolutely wonderful. All of the staff are very friendly and eager to make your stay perfect. We booked a hammam and massage on one of the days it rained and it was a great experience. You can't go to Morocco and not try a hammam! We felt very comfortable and it was relaxing which was important after a long trip and busy days exploring the city. We celebrated my husband's birthday while in Marrakech. I went down the morning of his birthday to request something be left in the room for him and the hostess smiled and told me it was already taken care of! I was blown away. They took it upon themselves to look at the booking information take note that is was his birthday and arrange a celebration for him....on their own! They had set up a separate location for us to enjoy break fast. Afterwards the table was cleared and the host place red rose petals one at a time on our table following this the entire riad staff came out with a small birthday cake and the most beautiful flower bouquet I have ever seen and sang Happy Birthday in 3 languages! It was such a special experience and so very thoughtful of the manager and staff! I wish I could highlight one thing to help but honestly everything was perfect.

He took note of any reservations we had during the stay so that we could be accommodated accordingly with drivers food to go or anything else we might have needed.    The location is perfect inside the Medina and a short walk to Jamaa El Fna. You can easily find taxis in the area if you are venturing out of the area.    Although we didn't have a full meal the small snacks we did have in the restaurant were delicious we enjoyed wine by the fire in the evenings and were treated with the very best service.

Riad Dar Anika,Exp T wrote a review Nov 2016,50,Sublime Service and surroundings in Marrakech,This lovely riad is most like a boutique hotel. It's difficult to know where to begin singing its praises. I stayed for a business (great internet) but bit by bit the surroundings and wonderful manager and staff began wearing off the layers of tension and I found myself looking forward to seeing them in the evenings almost as if I was returning home. Was it the dates and fresh milk every night daily laundry and the hammam? Or was it the authentic Moroccan breakfast on the rooftop terrace or the lovely room with ornate plaster carvings and inlaid furnishings? It's hard to know except that at each step of my stay Antonio the owner and staff ensured that I knew everything I needed to feel at home and was able to enjoy the city and my business trip to the fullest. I hosted a dinner at the riad in the courtyard by candlelight by the small pool under the eaves and there too the hotel and staff created an amazing atmosphere and memories. This stay alone committed me to return to Morocco and learn more about this fabulous country and citizens and Riad Dar Anika is where I will stay as a tourist.

Riad Dar Anika,stephenharper2016 wrote a review Nov 2016,50,"Best ""Hotel"" Experience Ever",Dar Anika is hard to summarize except to say it was the best vacation hotel experience we have ever had in a long life of travel. Located on the edge of the Medina you are well situated for shopping and site seeing. The staff is superb and provide a level of personalized service (including goat's milk and dates every evening in your room) that is fantastic. Made us feel at home. They easily dealt with any questions or issues we had. Breakfast on the rooftop patio is a great way to start the day. when we were too tired to go out at night (after a long day of touring) the food from the Dar Anika kitchen was excellent.,Date of stay: November 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Rockville, Maryland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephenharper2016
Riad Dar Anika,zombiebacons wrote a review Nov 2016,50,Authentic Moroccan Oasis,We just stayed at Riad Dar Anika for two days as we were traveling through Marrakech. It is perfectly located at the entrance to the Medina and only a short walk to Jamaa El Fna (the center market). The manager Antonio and the entire staff were incredibly accommodating. You are welcomed to the Riad with Moroccan mint tea and pastries upon your arrival and from that point on it is impeccable service and amazing food for your entire stay. If you need to book any activities or reservations the staff can do that for you when you get there as well. The interior is an authentically Moroccan cozy and comfortable oasis in the heart of the busiest part of the city.,Date of stay: November 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zombiebacons
Riad Dar Anika,leiland88 wrote a review Nov 2016,50,Dar Anika Is a GEM!,I visited Dar Anika the last week of October 2016.    I believe the true test of a hotel's quality comes not when things go perfectly right but when something goes wrong or not quite what you'd expect. This hotel is an absolute GEM for countless reasons but primarily because of the utmost professionalism shown after I reported a small issue. The owner and his brother as well as the other staff were determined to go above and beyond to correct the matter and provide me with an experience I would never forget.    First the location is PERFECT as it is immediately accessible from one the main thoroughfares in the Mellah (Jewish quarter) section of the media. If you know anything about the dizzying maze-like streets in Moroccan medinas you will be grateful for it. Dar Anika is in close proximity to nearly all of the main sights (less than 10 minutes walk) making it the most convenient hotel I stayed in during my entire trip.    The rooms are colorful and decorated elegantly. I really loved the plaster work (one of the key elements you will see throughout Morocco) and attention to detail.    The owner and his brother both named Abu were very helpful with recommending worthwhile sights as well as places to purchase excellent gifts to take back to colleagues and family. The owner was gracious enough to show me the riad they're working to open next and it is GORGEOUS! I'm already trying to figure out how to get back!    As a woman traveling alone they made me feel safe and welcome (VERY important). I was a bit sad I wasn't there with a significant other as the hotel is quite romantic especially at night in the lobby as well as the rooftop!    The food was good but there are so many delicious places to eat in Marrakech so you may not want to eat there every night.    All in all I lucked out with Dar Anika. Stay here and you won't be disappointed.,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leiland88

Riad Dar Anika,4Michael17 wrote a review Nov 2016,50,"Great for Moroccan charm, cuisine and convenience",If you like your hotels to be Hiltons or Holiday Inns this is not your place. Like many places on old Marrakech (the Medina) you walk to it a few meters down a pedestrian walkway from the main road. You open the door wondering if you are in the right place. And from that moment you are welcomed as family with fresh milk and dates tea and pastries as they register you and give you the lay of the land.    This is a totally charming 3-story 10-room guest house in an old Moroccan building that features old country architecture and features. The rooms are very comfortable and luxurious and decorated in old Moroccan style.    It also has a fantastic restaurant that is frequented by guests and outsiders. You have the option of eating downstairs next to a fountain the the fire place. Or (my favorite) eat on the roof top and enjoy the cool fresh air and view.    I cannot overstate how great their hospitality is. They helped me with directions car arrangements business needs and what I should see while there -- always with great courtesy and a smile.

But soon this worry vanished as I entered Dar Anika . I have stayed in the best hotels around the world but this one was really special and cozy . Both the owner Abu Molook and the Manager Antonio made me feel really at home. They gave me an amazing insight about the city and the culture. I even fell sick and they looked after me as their own family member. The rooms are beautiful the Riad is just located in few minutes walk to the souk.

Riad Dar Anika,Christophe B wrote a review Nov 2016,50,Best Riad in Marrakesh,This was our first trip to Marrakech. The service at the riad was fantatstic. From the very first meeting to the minute of departure everybody went out or their way to be helpful and make our stay memorable. We were explained how to work the city how to get out take taxis work the souks haggle...etc. Everybody in the team takes their responsibiliies at heart and very personally. Needless to say that all rooms are impeccably cleaned every day. The setting and attention to detail in the tasteful decoration the lighting the pool area the terrace all contributed to an amazing restful and cultural experience.    I wish I had not booked my transfer to and from the airoport with the trip organiser but instead let the riad organise it. The riad will send you an email and contact numbers as soon as the reservation is made. They offer to pick you up and drive you back organise dinner or a snack the evening you arrive. They also will orgainse a whole suite of activities to perform in the area of Marakesh so wait to see what they offer before booking anything else.

Dar Anika offered a tranquil sanctuary in the heart of the chaos that is the Medina. NOTHING was too much trouble all the staff smiled and couldn't do enough for us.    The Riad has been done up in a shabby chic Moroccan style but had all the mod cons and was really clean. The beds were really comfortable with PROPER linen on them and fresh fruit and bottled water were put in the rooms daily.    I am not your 'normal' guest and was distressed at all the poor donkeys and cats and although they must have thought me mad gave me buckets of water to give to the donkeys daily!    The breakfasts are HUGE and utterly delicious especially their homemade yoghourt which was out of this world. Their Hammam scrub and massage was beyond wonderful too - a great start to the holiday!    We had to leave at 7am for our flight home and Antonio the marvellous manager came in on his day off to say goodbye to us. He then gave us the most delicious picnic to eat at the airport. Extraordinary!    They are opening another Riad very soon and if it's HALF as good as Dar Anika it will be a great success!

Riad Dar Anika,821alexandra wrote a review Oct 2016,50,An outstanding experience.,I stayed at Dar Anika for over a week last June. The experience was lovely. From the milk and date reception to the sending off with sandwiches (on gluten free bread) for my flight there was not a detail that wasn't tended to with the greatest of care and pride. A small Riad there is an intimate and special feeling staying here. The staff will cater to your every need. They accommodated my gluten-free restriction and served a beautiful breakfasts on the terrace where they also serve dinner. There is a lovely room on the ground level where you can smoke and watch movies or simply work.  Their open ground terrace is adjacent to their pool which is not used by guests as often as it should be The room was comfortable and immaculate and the daily laundry service was an added bonus. An ideal place to work or simply relaxed while having the full staff of the hotel at your disposal for anything you may need. Ideally situated one could walk to the Medina (5 minutes) and any other of the attractions in the Medina.  I loved staying here and will do so whenever I am back in Marrakesh.

Riad Dar Anika,Paradise564636 wrote a review Oct 2016,50,Tranquil home from home in the busy Medina,We spent two nights at Dar Anika with our four adult/teenage children. It was an ideal base from which to explore the souks and Medina. We are frequent travellers and I have to say that the staff were some of the most welcoming and friendly we have come across. The charming General Manager Antonio personally talked us through the dos and donts of exploring the souks - useful advice for travelling generally; as well as helping with restaurant reservations and any other questions we had. He even gave each of us a business card with his personal mobile number in case we ran into difficulties in the souk.    Antonio's team of staff are well trained and very welcoming. Lesson looked after us most attentively at breakfast at the pretty roof top restaurant. This huge and delicious feast kept us going all day.    Dar Anika is small and we have stayed in other Marrakech riads where the building has more of a 'wow factor' but the welcome and little extras at this one are hard to beat. Indeed when we left Dar Anika we went on to stay at a spectacular five star resort hotel outside the city and although the facilities were excellent we missed the Dar Anika personal welcome and kindness.,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paradise564636

The rooms in this 12 room hotel are decorated in traditional moroccan style. We had booked 2 rooms but one was too small and the hotel owner Abu immediately changed it for us.  The service and hospitality is amazing at Riad Dar Anika. The staff makes sure every guest feels right at home. We had breakfast at the roof top restaurant every day. A lady baked fresh moroccan bread right in front of our eyes. The freshly squeezed and all you can drink orange juice was certainly a treat. On the day of our departure Abu the owner handed us 4 canvas bags to take with us. He had packed us sandwiches that were still warm fruit water and other goodies. He told us the sandwiches are what his mom used to make when he was growing up. He really touched us by his grace. He was always available in the lobby and we spent a lot of time talking to him about everything and anything. He certainly left a good impression on us.  The Wifi is very good at the hotel but there was no TV in the room. That was the only drawback.

Riad Dar Anika,Boo Y wrote a review Oct 2016,50,Best hotel I have ever stayed in.,I went to Marrakech for my honeymoon and stayed at the Dar Anika which was just amazing. I cannot pay enough compliments.  At the time I was doing my research Dar Anika had approximately 95% of its reviews as 5* and the rest were 4* - which was astonishing considering there was almost 600 reviews. I was very intrigued how they had such consistently good reviews. Well I know now. The way we looked after was something I haven't even experienced when staying with family.    1. We were greeted at the door and not just checked-in at reception but taken to the poolside and brought milk dates Moroccan sweets. Such a nice way of being welcomed in.    2. The manager (Antonio) then sat with us for half an hour and gave us a map and loads of amazing inside information about Marrakech which you can only get from a local. We really appreciated how thoughtful and useful this was and really set the tone for our whole stay.    3. Our room (the Suite) was very comfortable and tastefully decorated. I loved the bathroom products which were made with natural argan oil    4. The breakfast served was amazing. And after the first couple of days the waiters remembered exactly was we liked (e.g coffee tea orange juice). On the second day we woke up late and were leaving the Riad around midday. We bumped into the owner who asked us if we had had breakfast. When we replied we had woken up too late and therefore missed breakfast he said nobody should leave without eating and sent us to the roof terrace and specially ordered breakfast be sent before we left to wander the city!    5. The staff were very attentive incredibly polite and went the extra mile whenever possible. We noted during our stay that whenever we returned to the hotel in the afternoon to avoid the heat we would always have complimentary drinks sent to our room within 5-10 minutes - and they were these divine iced mint / lemon drinks which were incredibly refreshing. The reception team helped book all our taxis and made all restaurant reservations for us.    6. The owner also gave us a special gift which I won't say here as everyone will be requesting it! - but it was incredibly generous of him    7. On the day we were leaving we had arranged to go for a trek in the Atlas mountains and the staff had prepared a bag for us with sandwiches fruits and drinks to take.    8. The Wifi was easily the best out of the 3 hotels we stayed at    9. Location - perfect. 10 minutes walk to most of the main attractions in the heart of the medina.    Just overall 10/10. There probably are other hotels with more amenities (full-sized pool gym sauna etc etc) but if you want to stay in a Riad in the Medina this is THE best. The staff made my honeymoon unforgettable and I will be eternally thankful for what they did.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/booy384

It is filled with the most helpful friendliest warm hearted people you will ever meet. The Riad is perfectly located just outside the hustle and bustle of the main square but within walking distance to pretty much everything.    Antonio and his employees cannot do enough to ensure you have the perfect stay. The rooms are individually beautifully decorated and so clean and tidy as is the whole Riad. On our arrival we were greeted with some dates water and mint tea - which after a 4am start was most welcome and to our delight we were also offered breakfast on the terrace which no other hotel ever has offered on morning travels. Antonio then went through a map of the Medina highlighting places of interest entrances from different directions should we go outside of the walls and his mobile number should we got lost. He also advised things to be watchful of and could he help with anything to let him know.    We had already pre-arranged with the Riad for a 3 hour medina tour but Antonia also then arranged a trip to the Atlas Mountains - which was totally amazing. After a 2hr 30 min hike we had lunch with a traditional Berber family which was not a tourist gimmick offered by some tours we have previously been on elsewhere. This village was in the middle of the mountains not accessible by cars but tracks through the mountains which was not for the faint hearted - so we knew it was traditional! The food was amazing the best lamb we have ever had.    This small but beautiful formed Riad has no boundaries in providing the best it can possibly offer. It's the small touches that make your stay so unforgettable and provide lovely memories. They literally cannot do enough for you from offering the greatest breakfast however I suggest you embrace that you will put on a few pounds as the food is never ending Larson who served us breakfast each daywe nicknamed Larson 5 and half kilos as he just kept bringing food but it was good food!    It was my husbands birthday the day we left and after an early breakfast he was presented with a delicious birthday cake and congratulations from the team and a lovely handwritten message. After saying our goodbyes with mouthfuls of cake we were given a little bag with sandwiches apples and grapefruit for our flight also our departure forms already completed. So whilst everyone was hectic trying to complete these in the immigration queue we breezed past and on the Ryanair flight when people were eating overpriced somewhat god awful food - we were eating our delicious snacks result!    Please do not look any further if you are planning a trip to Marrakech if you want to have a taste of proper Morocco and not just be a number of a hotel room but be known who you are with the warmest genuine service then you have just found your hotel.

Well after a few days at the Riad I'm a believer. Every positive review on this site is well deserved and I'm happy to add my own 5-star review.    I've stayed at luxury resorts all over the world and I've never had better service anywhere. And as a solo traveler the hotel was very conscientious about safety and offering as much information as possible.    Upon arrival the owner sat with me and outlined all the things to do in the city how to get there and what the taxi fares should cost. He even offered tips on how to negotiate at the souks. But by far the most impressive amenity was the cell phone they gave me in case I needed to reach the hotel during my stay. That was above and beyond any service I've ever received!    In addition there was an amazing breakfast spread everyday a wonderful hammam a beautiful pool a lovely well-kept room evening desserts daily fruit the packed lunch upon check out... and the list goes on.

The hotel in itself was beautiful with a dining space downstairs a spa in the back and beautiful rooms. Our room was gorgeous clean and included great amenities. We were served an enormous breakfast on the beautiful rooftop terrace which included fruit soup crepes cakes yogurt coffee and tea. Again the staff was kind and accommodating continuing to offer us anything we could have wanted. The hotel was perfectly located and was a short walk to all of the major sites within the Medina. Because we were leaving Marrakech that evening we asked the hotel if we could store our luggage while we explored during the day. Not only did they allow us to keep our luggage in the room but they also gave us access to use our room to shower before we left for the airport since the room was not being used that night. The hotel organized a car to take us to the airport and provided us a bag with sandwiches and fruit to take with us to the airport.

Riad Dar Anika,cth0masd wrote a review Sep 2016,50,Best hotel in Morocco.,There’s absolutely no need to look elsewhere if you plan on staying in Marrakesh. My wife and I checked in and right away we were made to feel at home. Abu sat us down our first morning and gave us an extremely helpful crash course on the city (it was our first time visiting) and arranged an amazing trip into the Atlas mountains. If you want to venture up into the mountains yourself make sure to ask for Hassan he’s a great guide and makes the trip super fun. The complimentary breakfast would put American hotel offerings to shame and the entire staff was professional and extremely kind.    Hands down this is the best hotel in the city.

The staff also made me some simple food to try and keep down along with ginger tea and other various remedies. Additionally it was my girlfriend's birthday while we were there and they surprised her with a song and cake and flowers which was a very nice touch.    The rooftop terrace is very nice and the location of the hotel is excellent for access to the Medina.

The room itself was perfect for our needs and they even had this amazing selection of body wash for our showers. Anthony the manager was amazingly helpful in how to navigate the city and what to see during our short stay. They were also great when there was a mistake on our bill and ended up compensating part of the bill when it was charged incorrectly.    The breakfast was also an amazing experience. They piled on every selection of food you could think of and providing everything you could ever want. The yogurt here was amazing. Also had the pleasure of having dinner here as well. Food and service were excellent. Definitely try the camel tajine.    Only one interesting thing to add here. During our travels we had the pleasure of meeting a former staff member.

Riad Dar Anika,JOEJOURNEYS wrote a review Aug 2016,50,Superb! Excellence in service - Great location!,Dar Anika is my favourite riad in Marrakech centrally located and excellent service it feels very much like staying in a palace rather than a hotel. The service is very personal and each guest is catered to their own needs.    A second return to Marrakech and without a doubt I knew to stay here again. Dar Anika did all it could to ensure my stay was comfortable excellent service great food – this is the kind of place where one feels like a prince or princess or even a king or queen a palace rather than a hotel.    The location is ideal centrally located and just minutes away from the lively Jemaa el-Fnaa square and the giant souks of Marrakech.    Working with you to ensure you get the most out of your stay from visiting the sites of Marrakech to venturing far along the Road to the Desert to spend a night under the stars in the Sahara - Dar Anika helped with any requests I had.    The word riad comes from the Arabian term for garden “ryad” often interpreted to mean “paradise”. Riad Dar Anika certainly feels like a piece of paradise within the Marrakech medina and can't help but praise it for the efforts to ensure my stay went as expected.    The courtyard at the heart of the building has a heated pool on one side and a cosy enclosed lounge with fireplace on the other side. Calm relaxed and informal Dar Anika staff show a real interest in guests comfort and holiday enjoyment.    This won't be the last time I return - I often recommend Marrakech as I believe it is the best exotic destination nearest to Europe and staying in a place like Riad Dar Anika certainly makes the experience that much special.,Date of stay: July 2016,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joejourneys

Ever since we've been back to New York we say to each other ""customer service is nothing like Anika"". Top notch people there.. They truly make you feel special. As we arrived the staff greeted us with drinks and snacks then Antonio the manager gave us a talk about the area and answered any questions we had. Breakfast was so delicious! Keeps you full all day. For the ladies I brought my own hairdryer because usually when I travel they always have week ones but in Dar Anika they have a powerful salon grade one so no need to bring your own.

We complained and the manager immediately moved us to a bigger room and really went out of his way make sure we were looked after with champagne and flowers.    Previous reports of management issuing letters about giving good reviews on Trip Advisor are accurate but this was a letter put into our free lunch pack to take to the airport with us so plus and minuses there I suppose.

Firstly it will attack all your senses by its design in typical oriental style but there is something more real sense for details and creation atmosphere. You feel you are at right place just now and nothing else matters. Secondly the hospitality starting with the manager of the hotel finishing by full service of the staff.

If I could rate in stars 5 wouldn’t be enough.  Riad Dar Anika is an absolute gem and I can’t believe I haven’t written a review earlier.    Antonio the manager of the Riad was so kind and informing. He even took the time to take my daughters iPhone to a shop in the middle of the city to get her screen fixed at a cheaper rate. In the meantime he equipped us with a mobile phone with a Morrocan number in case we wanted to reach him or had questions about where to go and what to do.    Everybody who worked at Riad Dar Anika were angels and I will definitely return.    I recommend anybody to come here I’ve been to Marrakesh before but at Riad Dar Anika.

If you want to feel like royalty for a few days I promise you this is the place to stay.    - the breakfast on the rooftop is just divine - prepared next to you by a wonderful cook while you enjoy the beautiful view.

Riad Dar Anika,Vickie P wrote a review Jul 2016,50,Fantastic stay,We stayed at Riad Dar Anika last weekend and had a fantastic stay. The Riad had arranged an airport transfer for us - we were picked up in an air conditioned car with bottles of water which was very welcome after the airport queue's.  The Riad is in a great location right on the edge of the Medina so the car can drop you off right outside. We got a lovely welcome and the manager went showed us where we should go on a map and recommended places of interest and good restaurants and bars.  Nothing was too much effort for the staff and they would get us cold drinks before we set out for the day and told us if there was any fruit / food we would like to try just take a photo of it and they would get it and prepare it for us.  The breakfasts were huge with many courses so allow at least an hour. Served on the beautiful rooftop terrace where you could also have dinner or drinks.  The food and drink in the Riad was reasonably priced compared to many of the other places we went and they were also more than happy to supply wine glasses for wine we had bought at the airport.  There is a small pool in the Riad which is perfect for cooling down after being out on the 45 degree temperatures but don't splash about as the water does go everywhere all over the marble floors!  There were a couple of small incidents where the waiter split coffee / watermelon / beer over us but it didn't detract from the overall great service of the Riad.  The bedrooms were beautifully decorated and even though our room was opposite the mosque I didn't get woken up by the call to prayer as they have this big cushion / window plug thing that kept all the noise out. They gave you a new bottle of water in the room every night as well as milk and dates at bed time.  I would recommend this Riad to anyone who is looking for an oasis of peace and tranquility in the middle of chaos of the Medina. The service was outstanding and we couldn't of asked for any more.

The city is really loud and busy and hustle  but as soon as you enter the hotel you feel you are in another world and you can relax whenever you want. You swim in the pool and get a fresh juice without asking. We travel a lot but this hotel was definitely one of the best. I appreciate it also that the hotel manager welcomed us and gave us information and tips introduced himself which makes everything very personalised but it was not too much. There is only one thing i did not like was in the end when we had to leave the hotel manager gave us a sheet which says that they would get penalties if we do not leave a excellent review - which i leave anyway as this stay was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.

We were greeted with the kindest of staff and brilliant service!  They noticed we were looking at the Wimbledon final score on our phones so invited us downstairs to the court yard to watch it live along with complimentary drinks and pastries - we couldn't have asked for more!

Riad Dar Anika,Vicki B wrote a review Jul 2016,50,WOW! What a great expereince,I can not say enough about the service in this lovely place. From the moment we entered to seeing us to our transport the staff and management were beyond exceptional. We've had the opprtunity to travel a fair bit and I have to henstly say I've never had service like this.    The accomidation was charming and just within the Medina and located a short distance from the Market. After wondering around we were greated back in our room with cold drinks as the staff knocked on our door with this suprize. as we had just retruned from a week traveling arounhd Morocco it was a great gift to find out that laundry service was provided and all my dirty gear was returned within a few hours clean and ready to go again.    Antonio the manager was a delight to talk to and gave us the low down on what to see and what to be weary of. He also helped me at the pharmacy when my partner was a little under the weather. They bent over backwards to make sure my partner didnt miss a minute of the Euro 2016 by running out and making sure they had the right chip to recieve the channels for the broadcast.    Additonally when they learnerd it was my parners birthday we were suprized with a great cake and flowers at dinner and a room upgrade. Completly unexpected and a wonderful treat. The service was so personal it was like a little peice of heaven in a hectic but vibrant city! I shouldn't fail to mention that on our departure they even gave us a packaed lunch for our flight!    Highly recommended and I hope I get to go back. Cant say enough about our experience here! 5*+++,Date of stay: July 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/70vickib
Riad Dar Anika,Albert S wrote a review Jul 2016,50,"Exceptional Service, Luxurious, Comfortable",If you get the chance to stay here do it. One word for the experience: wow. From the moment I stepped inside and was greeted by Fatima it was clear that Dar Anika was a special place. The staff was exceptional and attentive to every need whether expressed verbally or not.    Breakfast was a feast every morning. Camel meat omelette breads fresh juices fresh fruit and on and on... No matter how many times I left the room everytime I returned it was not only cleaned but personally manicured and restocked with fresh fruit and drinks.    The owners helped round out my activity itinerary with great recommendations and helpful advice on the plans I had previously made. Let's be clear Dar Anika is on the high end of the price scale for Morocco but it is worth every penny. I would especially recommend staying there upon your initial arrival because they'll be incredibly helpful as you learn the Medina local customs and expectations and plan your adventure.    They've earned every one of the five stars I'm giving them in this review but it's always helpful to offer a suggestion or two. My one suggestion is to be a bit more explicit about the costs of add on serveices that are offered. To their great credit so many things are complimentary (like the incredible breakfasts snacks and refreshments every time I came to the lobby multiple room cleanings and on and on) that I was surprised when I got the $30 USD (round trip) bill for the chauffeur to the New City for dinner. The convenience was definitely worth it but we would've liked to know about the fees in advance. (I would've made the same decision to be clear because although a local taxi would've been about $3 USD it would've come with the hassle of hailing and haggling with the driver.)    In event I'm a tough customer but Dar Anika won me over with extraordinarily service superb accommodations and a remarkable attention to detail.

We arranged a car to pick us up from the airport (our flight changed 3 times and we received email confirmation quickly every time). The car was prompt and easy to find. It was a short ride to the hotel where we were promptly offered (an amazing) breakfast even though we were just checking in. The manager Antonio greeted us at our table to discuss our plans for our short stay in Marrakech. He offered us valuable tips and recommendations. After a full and busy day our room (decorated with fresh flowers and petals) was a welcome sanctuary from the noise and busy nature of the city.

We have stayed at thousands of hotels all over the world and the attentive service provided by the Dar Anika staff was unquestionably the best we have ever experienced.

Riad Dar Anika,Charles B wrote a review Jun 2016,50,Amazing Affordable Luxury in true authentic style and service,We planned a visit to Marrakesh to celebrate a friends birthday we were given 3 Riads to choose from based on a recommendation. Riad Dar Anika went well beyond what was expected and coming from the luxury hotel background myself I was astonished and pleasantly surprised by the attention to detail of the friendly and happy employees not to mention the wonderful and charming GM. I felt totally at home straight away within the hustle and bustle of this magical city. The rooms and suites are very comfortable and decorated in true Moroccan style which takes you back in time. The personally hand picked soft chilled music on the terrace enables you to put your feet up and relax with a drink or having a nice meal cooked by their excellent chef which when if you live in London like me then a few days away is another of life's pleasures that need not be interrupted. I have just returned to re-book for after the summer! Need I say anymore. Thank you Riad Dar Anika.

Riad Dar Anika,Anita H wrote a review Jun 2016,50,AMAZING RIAD IN THE HEART OF MARRAKESHES WALLED CITY,We stayed at the Riad Anika from the 18th June for 3 nights (a long weekend). We travelled via a no frills airline and by the time we landed in Morocco and had been processed by immigration we were starting to feel the strains of the journey. Leaving the airport we negotiated a fare of 200 Dirhams for the journey to the Riad Anika we managed to halve this on our return. We left the taxi and were very quickly surrounded by people offering to help us with our luggage or offering to direct us to the Riad at a cost. The situation was a bit of a culture shock but we found the Riad. Once inside it was a true sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of the streets outside and we were given the warmest welcome I have ever experienced. We were ushered to a lounge area were we washed our hands in rose water and then were served soup followed by milk and dates along with mint tea and biscuits it was un-believable. Once we had finished our arrival feast we were sat down by Antonio who sprawled a map over a round table and began to help us plan our attack on the city. We were given excellent advice and recommendations and the map and the briefing were a constant help throughout our stay. Once we caught our bags up in the room we were faced with an exceptionally clean space adorned with rose petals. The room itself is not huge as it’s a traditional Riad although the bathroom is a good size and complete with hand made soap bathrobes and other delightful personal touches. The bathroom had a coloured stained glass window which was a pleasure to wake up to. The breakfast is served on the roof terrace and was un-missable. We sat under the canopy of a Bedouin tent type structure on cushions and were served fresh orange juice and offered a variety of different teas or coffees along with soup breads preserves fresh fruit salad a choice of eggs and even fresh made to order crepes. We sat on the roof terrace on each evening to enjoy its panoramic advantage. The Riad is in a great location and was just a short walk from many of the places we wished to visit including ‘Kosy Bar’ the ‘Souks’ The ‘Jamaa el Fna’ and ‘Pepe Nero’. There is a taxi rank less than a minute away for those further afield excursions. Antonio recommended ‘Beldi Country Club Marrakech’ which is a must for a day of relaxation just a small drive outside Maraakesh itself . The room was cleaned more than once a day!!! and on our return from a day of exploring we were greeted by ether milk and dates or melon kebabs or even both. During our stay we spent the day at the La Mamounia a - so called 5 star hotel. The staff at the La Mamounia could learn a great deal about service and hospitality from the staff at Riad Anika. Iv travelled extensively but never experienced such hospitality. I write this review as a thank you for having us so to say and just wish I could do more to show our appreciation for making our stay so special. ………Oh and a special thank you for the knapsack that was gifted to us as we departed the Riad which was filled with fresh fruit and lunch a great touch which was greatly appreciated.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anitah502

Some should take notice (and learn) how this small place is being run. Where else do you get a sandwich and fruit to take on your flight?! It may be a small gesture but it makes a lot of difference- it shows that they care for you. The chamber maids kept the room very clean as they did the hotel. Breakfast was excellent and so was dinner. Easy access to everywhere. Unfortunately the hammam is not all day operational so you do have to book a time and that is inconvenient.

Riad Dar Anika,slimmorrell wrote a review Jun 2016,50,Exceptional service and opulent surroundings,Everything you expect from a 5* hotel but in an intimate and beautiful setting.    Free water and pastries each day. Even dates and milk before bed time. The breakfast and dinner courses are ENDLESS and exceptionally delicious.They bring a cold drink when you stumble back in from the Medina - VERY welcome. A lady making breads for breakfast.    Easy to navigate to and from as its on a main road/square where cars can access. Great if you want to get Taxis. You will have less chance getting lost even when walking as its not down ten small alleyways (that all look the same in the dark).  An orientation as you arrive with no hard sell to do tours just good sensible advice for a full on city. The staff walked us out to the drivers/ taxi's organised for us. Slightly intimidating outside the front door but its real Marrakesh so thats to be expected.    Very quiet Riad I was only woken by the call to prayer (unavoidable) and I am a light sleeper and fully anticipated to have broken sleep.    Staff where all friendly and spoke good English wake up call was reliable. They did us breakfast for our early departure PLUS a picnic for the flight. They even got us olive oil for our Henna tattoos. Exquisite restaurant recommendation.    Only considerations are:  The pool was very cold - perhaps a good thing for refreshing tired feet.  i would have liked moisturiser in the bathroom not just shower gel.  The bathrooms are western style which is slightly disappointing.

Riad Dar Anika,Peter B wrote a review Jun 2016,50,A little gem on a perfect location,We thoroughly enjoyed 5 days (and nights) at Dar Anika. Staff is wonderful they seem to be everywhere to help out.    Sit down on a chair and they will pop up with fresh mint tea and crispy little fruit tarts all complimentary. Five start service in a homely setting.    We loved the breakfast where freshly baked pancakes joined bread rolls and homemade jams with any style of egg to complement a very good start for long walks in the Souks. These walks are made very easy as the location is just great. You literally walk out into the action and it is a pleasure to get lost in it all as you will be more than able to find the way back to this little sanctuary. Their restaurant can also be considered as one of the best we have tried in Marrakech.  The interior of our room resembled Aladins' cave. A tad dark but then again in the heat of summer big windows would most probably not help to keep the temperatures down when you want some rest.    If you are looking for both rest sheer spoils and a place to call your own have no doubts about the Dar Anika.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leuven, Belgium",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rianbkk

Riad Dar Anika absolutely smashes this. From the 5*++ personal welcome you receive to being constantly pleasantly surprised this is a hotel which goes above and beyond your expectation. The staff remember everything and make sure you are totally comfortable (without going over the top).    The next thing to mention is that a lot of hotels require you to get a taxi into the most interesting part of Marrakech the heart of the Medina. Riad Dar Anika is practically on the doorstep to everything and save from airport transfers we were able to walk everywhere. We were also able to return very easily if it got too hot to a nice air conditioned accommodation.    I didn't realise this until the last few days but a very nice bonus to this hotel is the roof top terrace. Not just the beautiful sun-trap on which you can enjoy an excellent breakfast but a further set of steps which give you views of everthing including but not limited to the Katoubia Mosque and the distant snow capped mountains! Plenty of cafes/restaurants offer you a terrace view but here it is right at your accommodation.    I can not wait to return. I loved this Riad and of course Marrakech it is an absolute battering of the senses; Endless souks and picturesque alleys snake charmers story tellers music and pulsing life. You do have to be on your toes but there are people who will go out of their way to help you if you need it- the city can seem a little overwhelming at first but you will fall in love with it!,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/894deanr
Riad Dar Anika,Marion K wrote a review Jun 2016,50,Not a Rose Petal Out of Place,What can we say? Dar Anika is exquisite in every detail and it has spoiled us for everyday life. If you don’t know what sights to visit the owner personally works out your itinerary. If you return from a long day of sightseeing looking hot and dusty moments later a waiter appears at the door of your room with glasses of chilled juice. While you are out for dinner unseen hands tidy the room and leave a bedtime snack of dates and milk. You begin your day with a luxurious breakfast on the breezy rooftop terrace and end it there with dinner or a drink under the stars. Your bathroom is stocked with fragrant argan-oil toiletries and if you book a hammam your skin is scrubbed silky smooth. All of the sights of the Medina are within easy walking distance. In short you are relieved of all of life’s difficulties until you regretfully leave for home.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marionk364
Riad Dar Anika,Hayaalnoaimi wrote a review May 2016,50,A home away from home in the heart of the medina...,o be honest when I first came to the Riad I had my hesitations considering the Bed and Breakfast style of the property. I was quick to change my opinion as the intimate setting of the hotel and the attentiveness of the staff made Riad Dar Anika a home away from home. The staff were eager to cater to our every need from advice on the best places to eat at Jmaa el Fnaa to the point where when I inquired about where I could get my hands on the Argan shampoo (provided in the bathrooms at the Riad) i was provided with two bottles of it upon departure.

Everything he told us to go see was amazing. He recommended an amazing spa experience dinner and nightlife. The hotel was impeccable  beautiful and the staff were amazingly helpful and friendly.

Riad Dar Anika,billabong76 wrote a review May 2016,50,Yet again a fabulous stay,Having stayed at Dar Anika in 2014 we decided to return and celebrate my 40th birthday for three nights on 25th May. It's always a concern when you go back to somewhere you have stayed before in case it's not as nice but we were certainly not disappointed !  We were collected from the airport and our luggage whisked to our room which was upgraded to a suite(room 2) It is a beautiful room with a domed ceiling lounge area with 2 chaise longues and a fire for the winter months. The bathroom only had a shower and no bath but this wasn't a problem. It is stocked with shampooshower gelsoapcotton wool pads and cotton buds.  In the wardrobe are reading lights for you to use a hairdryer safe extra pillows and blankets. You are also provided with bottled water every day and fruit/dates.  We had dinner here on our first night on the rooftop restaurant and it was the best meal of our entire stay (we also ate at Maison Arabe and Azar). I was also surprised with a delicious birthday cake and was sung to !  Breakfast is also served on the rooftop and consists of freshly squeezed orange juice coffee yoghurt fruit salad local cake Moroccan crepes and bread with butter honey and jam. We were so full we missed lunch everyday !!!  There are also sun-beds on the rooftop which have towels straw hats and fans for you to use.  We both had a hamman and massage which was wonderful. As the public ones are single sex it was nice to be able to do this together. There is a pool on the ground floor which is surrounded by candles - if you want to use it they pull curtains around it for your privacy as it faces inwards onto the courtyard.  The riad is very conveniently located for the souk - a 5 minute walk to the main square and a 15 minute drive to the airport.  You will see rave reviews on trip advisor about Maison Arabe but i feels like a Disney take on a riad and really a hotel rather than a riad as such. We also preferred the location of Dar Anika as well.  The service is faultless and staff so friendly and attentive. They really cannot do enough for you.

It is a fantastic place to stay for multiple reasons. First and foremost is the staff. They were amazing and their service was impeccable at all times. My wife and I were there on our honeymoon and the first morning they brought out champagne cake and sang for us. In addition to the amazing staff the food was very good. Breakfast on the roof every morning was lovely. We also ate dinner there one night in the courtyard which was very good. The property itself it also beautiful.

From the moment we walked in the beauty and peacefulness took our breath away. The service was nothing short of extraordinary and no detail was overlooked during our time there. We thoroughly enjoyed our breakfast each morning on the  rooftop terrace (which was enough to carry us through lunch) and then returning to the terrace for a drink each evening before dinner. For first timers to Marrakech the location was perfect with the main square just a few minutes walk away. All in all we could not find a single fault in our stay and would highly recommend this Riad.

First of all the service and attention is exceptional from the time of reservation until check-out. For example I requested flowers and fruit basket placed in the room for my wife with a romantic note which they did as a complimentary gift. Upon check-out at 6 am the manager Antonio and staff were up and ready with a packed breakfast.    The location is convenient within the medina though there was construction all around at the time we went. The room we reserved was a deluxe room which was way too small for our liking and without windows it felt claustrophobic. Thankfully we were upgraded to a superior room at the generosity of Antonio.    Breakfast in the terrace was great!!    What sets Dar Anika apart is indeed the service charm and location. I would only suggest a couple of minor improvements:    - keep a well stocked mini-bar / snacks  - have an in-room dining menu,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Manila, Philippines",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markypao

Riad Dar Anika,1Deanna99 wrote a review May 2016,50,An Oasis in Marrakech - A pure delight from the first hello to the last goodbye!,Riad Dar Anika is an oasis in middle of the Medina of Marrakech. From the moment you walk through their doors you are made to feel welcome and the Riad is beautiful and relaxing! Welcome beverage and snack are served during your leisurely check-in and then you meet with the manager Antonio who helps you plan your stay. Every member of staff is superb and every request is met with a smile and a warm response. Breakfast is delicious and plentiful and with the beauty of the rooftop added in every morning is a delight. We also took advantage of the rooftop in the evening for a cocktail and dinner. The food as in the morning was excellent the service was efficient and the atmosphere superb including a gentleman playing soft Moroccan music.    We booked a walking tour of the city through the Riad for our first full day which I would recommend as it helps to orient you to the very complex street system in Marrakech. Saad was our tour guide - he was fantastic! We always hope to have tour guides that are local and who can tailor their tour to our interests and Saad hit the mark! We also did the tour to the Atlas Mountains with a Berber guide. Hassan was also wonderful - we hiked through a few High Atlas Berber villages and had lunch at his mother's home where my husband learned how to make famous Moroccan mint tea!    We also took advantage of the private hammam and massage at the Riad and our attendants were all very good. If you have not visited a hammam before I would recommend it as a unique experience beyond the normal spa experience.    The location of the Riad is quite good as well if you are planning to spend time in the Medina as it is walking distance to most things. If you need a taxi or a driver the Riad will either arrange a private driver for you or will escort you to the street and get you a taxi (including negotiating the rate).    We visited several other Riads for dinner while we were there and I commented to my husband more than once that our Riad was far nicer and the service better. I would not hesitate to go back to Riad Dar Anika or to recommend it to family and friends. It is a slice of heaven and I am thrilled that it was a part of our trip to Marrakech.    I would recommend arranging the transfers through the Riad as it is a bit chaotic coming out of the airport and knowing that you have someone there to pick you up makes it less hectic. Also the Riad is very good at communicating with you prior to visit. I would not recommend spending a lot of time setting things up before you arrive as Antonio will go through everything again when you get there and depending on the weather you may need to change things. And on that topic should you need to cancel and event or change a dinner reservation the Riad staff is very accommodating and will arrange everything for you.    And finally if you have an early morning departure they do serve you full breakfast even if it is before hours and then they send you on your way with a bag full of sandwiches and fruit and a warm smile and thank you!,Date of stay: May 2016,,"Atlanta, Georgia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1Deanna99

Their drivers are best.  Also you have to experience Dar Anika's hammam - it is out of this world.  When booking the room I mentioned our upcoming wedding anniversary and then I forgot about it.

I have travelled a lot and stayed in a lot of places. This Riad takes a lot of beating.    It is a haven of tranquility from the hustle and bustle of outside. The interior is exquisite and full of beautiful flowers trees and the occasional friendly little bird. The rooms and Riad as a whole was spotless. The food amazing. The constant complementary snacks and refreshing drinks were fabulous. And the staff were so warm and friendly. I would advise anyone travelling to Marrakesh to stay here. And in case you were wondering about street noise there was no problem at all we took ear plugs but didn't need them. Our room 6 was street side they had a specially made and upholstered foam insert in our window which they put in at night time when they delivered our complementary night time milk and dates to our room. It acted as a sound barrier and apart from a muted call to prayer at 5 (which you hear everywhere in Morroco) there was no noise at all.  Perfect location perfect hosts. Loved it.

Riad Dar Anika,bcripps777 wrote a review Apr 2016,50,Amazing Visit At Riad Dar Anika,"My wife who generally plans our big trips out did herself this time. We were visiting our daughter who was spending a semester abroad in Barcelona. We met her there and moved on to Marakech.    Our plane was delayed and we did not get to the hotel until around 9:30pm. They immediately greeted us and ushered us into a lavishly furnished lounge area. They started by serving us mint tea and pastries. Very relaxing. They were chagrined to inform us that the kitchen was closed. However they kept bringing more small plates: dates with fresh milk a lentil (I think) soup and a few other things. Who needs the kitchen to be open with that kind of service!    Once we were fully checked in they showed us to our rooms. The four poster bed was strewn with rose petals. Very romantic. The room was big elegant and comfortable. The girl's room was not quite s big but was equally well appointed. We asked if we could have a bottle of wine sent to the room. The response: ""with pleasure"". This was basically the response to any request. One could get used to that.    The next day the manager spoke to us about the town what we wanted to do/see. Very informative and helpful. We pre-ordered dinner. I think you need to order by 3:00 if you plan on eating there. With only 9-rooms they can't be expected to keep a staff on hand if you decide to eat last minute. However given their willingness to please I'm sure they would pull something together. Dinner was great. Traditional tagine of various kinds appetizers and desert. Excellent.    One night before we went out we had a drink. We generally try to go with the flow and be ""local"". I was though in the mood for a ""dirty martini"" (vodka up with olives and a little olive brine). The waiter didn't know what that was. I would not have expected him to so no big deal. I explained. He basically brought an ""up"" martini with a couple of olives. Hey I gave it a shot. Not his fault it wasn't right. My wife and I enjoyed it. As we were leaving though he pulled me aside and asked him if there was anything wrong. I assured him that there was no problem and that I had been the one who ordered an idiotic drink. He then asked how he could improve it. We had a discussion about how to make a dirty martini. That is great service.    My wife had scheduled us for a Hammam (I am sure I have spelled this wrong). It is basically a steam bath with an attendant who exfoliates and washes you with various salts and mud concoctions. I will give this a 7 but with my wife giving it a 13 it balances to a 10. My only issue was that it was too hot. That though is a personal taste issue not a criticism of the process. My wife loved it. After we had a 1-hour massage which was also great.    Everything about this place is great. Very relaxing place to get away.",Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Teaneck, New Jersey",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bcripps777

Riad Dar Anika,Modal T wrote a review Apr 2016,50,A homely hotel in the heart of the hustle,Stayed February 2016    A small hotel 10 or so rooms which I think used to be the house of a prince. Free WiFi which was decent/stable.    The location is fantastic for walking to the square and some of the nice restaurants like Pepe Nero Nomad was nearby too infact the square is just a 5 minute walk where there is lots going on with several snack/coffee stops. Otherwise a taxi can be stopped just outside.    A great welcome from the hustle outside the owner sat with us and talked us through the various activities we could fit in during our 5 day stay he ordered a pizza in from outside for our fussy son- which was much appreciated. We were able to get an idea of what we could fit in to our 5 day stay by talking to the staff they were able to advise and book trips/restaurants for us. Everyone was knowledgeable and super kind and all very friendly to our son (7 years old).    The rooms are perfect and again have a homely feel as you’d expect from a Riad compared to a 5 star chain perfectly clean and comfortable and ample room to relax.The pool is small and more so for dipping than actual swimming – although fine for children to play/swim its located within the main internal dining area.    Breakfast every morning in the dining area was like home dining with a variety of things to try different each day followed by pancakes which our son really enjoyed.    We didn’t do any shopping.    A very enjoyable stay throughout made special by the staff who treated us like family a pleasant surprise on departure – very thoughtful.    Highly recommend no reservation.,Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/modalt

Riad Dar Anika,Wendy O wrote a review Apr 2016,50,Very special place with a magical staff!,We loved our time at the Riad; it was really the staff that made it magical. Everyone there made you feel like royalty. They took such great care us from the moment they opened the beautiful front door to welcome us. Honna was so sweet to my 4-year-old that when we were checking out he told me that he was going to miss her. Their customer service is a top down effect as the owner is so concerned about his guests and it shows. One evening we were going to an outdoor show and it was very cold. As we were leaving the front desk staff provided us all with hoodies to ensure we would be comfortable. Everyone should be lucky enough to stay in the place that really values their guests like Dar Anika does.    The Riad itself is beautiful and very quite. We all slept great. The food was spectacular especially our welcome Harira and treats. The breakfast was out of this world with course after course and everything was not only beautiful but tasted wonderful as well.

And after 5 minutes a person was in front of my room giving me even shampoo and two bottles of body wash he bought. It was so amazing! The next day we need to catch a 5pm train to Casablanca and before I went to the train station they surprised us again by giving me a bag of fruits and sandwiches to eat on the train.

Upon arrival we were invited to sit in the lounge/lobby and enjoy milk and dates soup mint tea and sweets. The manager took time to give us tips to make our stay in Marrakesh more enjoyable. Our room was covered in rose petals. Bottled water sweets milk fruit and laundry services were complimentary. The breakfasts were amazing with the best home made yogurt ever. All of the food (dinner and breakfast) was fresh and made in house. Upon our return from the day's activities we received fresh strawberry drinks. We left an electronic reader out to charge during the day and when we returned the staff had placed the charging reader on a small table. Each day on our return we had fresh water and other treats in our room. Rather than just giving directions one of the attendants walked us to a local restaurant. On our departure we were provided a small lunch in a satchel. The front desk provided great recommendations for activities and restaurants and made arrangements when needed. Once again the service was amazing.    The Riad has a great location with many of the attractions of the Medina in walking distance. The roof top terrace provided a quiet and relaxing setting while allowing you to observe the hustle and bustle of the street below.

From the time we walked in to the time we left we felt very welcome and well taken care of. We had a wonderful reception they offered us food drinks roses you name it Hanane made sure our check in was as easy as possible. Even before we saw the rooms we were happy. The rooms were lovely rose pedals everywhere very very clean very comfy beds and beautiful decore. The breakfasts were amazing dont think I have ever had scrambled eggs as good as that in my life. And there was always plenty of food to take us all the way to dinner. And the dinners were amazing too definatly the best meals of our trip. But by far the best thing about our stay were the people that worked there. Every single one of them was very kind to us and did everything possible for us. We had a huge issue when one of us was flying into Brussels and the plane was cancelled they went to a lot of effort and sorting it out for us. The two brothers who run this riad have done an excellent job in chosing good people and they themselves are around all the time to take care of their guests. But a very special mention goes to Hanane at the front desk she went way further then she needed to help us out even walked us to places because we did not know where we were going. She is a great person and I would be very happy to call her a friend. Thank you for everything Hanane.And thank you everyone else as well they even gave us a lunch bag on the way out taking care of the customers to the end.

Riad Dar Anika,Neil P wrote a review Mar 2016,50,"5 star service, genuine Moroccan hospitality, superb location. Our Marrakech oasis.",We were overwhelmed by the hospitality shown to us by the staff in the riad. Their attention to detail is something else. Do not be put off by the un-assuming entrance - this is a traditional riad building set in the old town. It's location couldn't have been better. Yes there are other riads further in towards the main square but you don't want to be trudging through the souk with your luggage !. Dar Anika is about as close as you can get by car/taxi and is just a few steps away from where the taxi will drop you. However don't be worried about getting the into the magical frenzy of Marrakech. It's just a 10 minute walk to the main square and the labyrinth of the souks through the adjacent alleyway (which is a mini souk in it's own right). The Petit taxi rank is just opposite and so is ideal.    The hotel itself is a traditional Riad and so be prepared for the layout. It has a central courtyard and all the rooms are arranged around it. All have windows facing into the courtyard (I think a few might have had small windows facing out into the town as well can't be sure). This can make the rooms seem a bit dark to begin with but we opened the windows into the courtyard and this gave a sense of light and space into the room. This is just how Riads are made - have a look at the old palaces in the city and you'll find exactly the same layout. We found the rooms and hotel to be delightful - a real oasis from the hustle and bustle of the old town. This was enhanced by being served ice-cold strawberry drinks as soon as we arrived back in the afternoon.    In short if you're after a superb location and a real Moroccan experience with first class 5-star service then Dar Anika is the place to stay.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/859neilp

We arrived very early in the morning to be seated on the roof and served the most spectacular breakfast. I suspect it may well have become the highlight of our day. The setting is amazing we loved watching the hustle and bustle below us the smells on the stalls selling the spices ad candles the call to prayer. Just everything. Breakfast ended up taking between two to three hours!!    Location wise you are right on the edge of the souk and can get a taxi straight to the front door!! You couldn't be better placed.    I loved the souk and the noise and people were amazing. We were too white British girls travelling alone and felt safe and happy at all times. It is only polite to be respectful of the cultures wherever you go.    We struggled to spend money when we were there the food and drink is amazing and cheap. We went to French country clubs to eat and ate in the souk all was equally fabulous.    The staff were amazing the riad was beautiful the décor stunning and certainly quality. it was always spotlessly cleaned.    Delighted that this is where I choose to celebrate my birthday.

Hanan with her beautiful charm and smile was always on hand to serve us delicious pastries and olives with some well deserved dacquiries! after hours of wondering around the souks. Mohammed was our personal driver and always greeted us with a smile and friendly humour. Overall we could not fault this hotel. We give it 10/10 and would not hesitate to return.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annewash

On arrival we were offered a evening meal which may I say was amazing the rooms are excellent comfortable beds clean and tidy. On arrival we were greeted by Antonnio who is one of the best hosts I have ever met explained dos and donts of Marrakech told us of some fab resturants and organised a taxi service for us being  being a party of 6 girls this was truly a must .

Perfectly located so we could walk everywhere. Owners and staff were very friendly and welcoming all times of the day. Gave good advise where to go eat and where not to. Little added extras a bonus.

Riad Dar Anika,TimKateFred wrote a review Mar 2016,50,So Glad We Found This Gem,Whenever we travel to a new city we always hope we will find a little gem that will be our hotel of choice whenever we revisit and at the Dar Anika we did. Everything was perfect - the staff were incredibly attentive and professional there is loads of character and arabic charm the breakfast and dinner we had one evening was delicious and the location is fantastic just a short walk from the main square. If you are wondering where to stay and looking a various options then my advice would be to look no further and stay here. We stayed in Marrakesh a few years ago in a hotel out of the centre that had a lovely pool but no character no charm and you could have been anywhere in the world. In the Dar Anika you feel safe and secure and in a perfect oasis that you can venture out from to explore.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,Surrey,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TimKateFred

Riad Dar Anika,David G wrote a review Mar 2016,50,Great hotel with fantastic service,We stayed at the Riad Dar Anika for three nights and have to say that it is probably the nicest small hotel we've ever stayed in. From the minute we arrived the service was nothing short of superb. We were met by Antonio the hotel manager and given soup and drinks and then shown to our room which was clean and well appointed. The hotel is in a great location a few minutes south of the main square and very close to other sights such as the El Badi Palace the Saadian Tombs and the Kasbah. It has a really calm atmosphere and the public areas are great to sit in.We really enjoyed the breakfasts each morning and being able to take it on the rooftop terrace was great. We ate in the hotel one night which was very nice and very reasonable.

Breakfast is taken on a rooftop terrace which is lovely also very nice for pre dinner drinks. Had dinner here on one night and it wad delicious! Would not hesitate to recommend or stay here again.

Riad Dar Anika,Ian M wrote a review Mar 2016,50,Outstanding,The quality and friendliness of the initial welcome and the service throughout our stay was outstanding. After we arrived Abu gave us a good introduction to the places to see and eat in Marrakech and offered to arrange any trips we wanted. When he realised we had left home very early that day he arranged for a complimentary breakfast on the roof terrace even though if was early afternoon. Throughout our stay the three owner managers and staff all seemed to have a very genuine concern for our enjoyment of the stay with them true hospitality and why the 5 stars was truly deserved. An example of this is the free drinks the staff bring you if you sit at a table on the roof or in the main areas downstairs. A mention too for Hannah who got us a table at Maison Arabe at short notice.    The room itself was a touch small and dark but I think that is often the case with the smaller riads. The shower was challenging the shower head was below my chin but there was always plenty of hot water - the managers are proud of the large hot and cold water storage on site to ensure continuity of supply.    We had an evening meal here one of the days during our stay and also enjoyed that very much.

Riad Dar Anika,sassyrick wrote a review Feb 2016,50,Absolutely wonderful,My husband and I stayed at Dar Anika for three nights 23rd - 26th February. Dar Anika exceeded our expectations. The Manager Antonio is charming and very knowledgeable. He sat with us for probably an hour when we first arrived to explain the map of the city tips where to go the souks where to eat safety etc etc. Very thorough and very informative and essential to us as it was our first time in Marrakech. All the staff are lovely and very efficient. The Riad is very clean and the food exceptional. The added bonus was being able to sit on the roof terrace and have breakfast. If it is too cold the staff bring woollen capes. On our second day in the afternoon we went to the Kozy Spa (recommended by Antonio) for a Hammam which was two hours steam scrub and massage. It was fantastIc and we thought great value. Don't be put off by the entrance as it says Kosy Bar. The Spa is at the top and is beautiful. The bar at the top is lovely and they play good music so we went back the next evening for a drink. It was my husband's birthday on the 25th and the Riad made him a cake and presented it at breakfast and the staff sang happy birthday - a lovely touch. The highlight of the trip for us was visiting the Atlas Mountains. Dar Anika organised that for us and a driver Jowad picked us up at 9. We drove to Imlil and met our guide Hassam. We walked for about 2 and a half hours (don't worry if you can't do that as Hassam will walk far enough to suit you). Hassam is a fantastic guide as he lives in the area and knows everything about it. We visited a waterfall and had lunch at Hassam's house where his mother cooked for us a delicious and huge lunch on the roof top overlooking the mountains. She also made a birthday cake for my husband. (Two cakes in one day)! The Berbers are lovely  kind generous people and we are so glad we did the trip. After lunch we walked for about 10 mins back to the car and Jowad drove us home. Jowad and Hassam spoke perfect English and are both absolutely charming and fun. On our last morning when we left Dar Anika to drive to Essaoiura we were presented with a packed lunch to eat on our journey. They think of everything! After only three days we felt like family. Another thing we liked about Dar Anika is the location. It's slightly on the edge of the town and away from the souks so it is a bit quieter. A wonderful stay and I would thoroughly recommend it.,Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Bath,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sassyrick
Riad Dar Anika,Elaine C wrote a review Feb 2016,50,Excellent homely stay in a friendly riad,From the moment we walked through the door we were greeted with the best Moroccan hospitality - rosewater to wash our hands some green or mint tea and some moroccan pastries. Antonio the hotel manager then took time to give us a map and explain where things were and to answer any questions we had. The Riad has a modern yet authentic feel. The room we had (number 8) was slightly on the small side but was perfectly nice. The attention to detail here is superb and the food excellent. We decided to eat in the riad on our first night - the chicken pastila is amazing and the wine list offers a good local choice. Also recommended is the roof terrace which is a perfect spot to watch sunset. 10/10.,Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cuffley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariasL6212RT

Riad Dar Anika,Ronnie09 wrote a review Feb 2016,50,"Amazing, amazing, amazing!",After reading all the great reviews of Dar Anika we were excited to be staying at one of the best riads in the city and right on one of the streets leading to Djenna El-Fna. It’s a boutique experience with many different zones for you to relax in – we loved the berber tent on the rooftop garden for its comfort and shade and also the traditional tea ‘lounge’ just at the top of the stairs and the room with a roaring wood fire (yes a fire! you may think this mad in a hot climate but it’s welcome on a winter night after a few gins on the roof terrace!). There’s also a plunge pool and a large choice of areas to relax in including sun loungers and various seated zones around the area. Plus the attention to detail in the decor is wonderful – from the carved wood ceilings on the ground floor to the red and floral stencilling on the mezzanine really living up to its 'boutique' title. It is a special place!    Upon arrival we met Antonio the manager who we read about on TripAdvisor - he really is a great person full of interesting information and recommendations to help you make the most of your stay. He gave us a pep talk of tips (you can find some of his Marrakech survival tips at our rocknrolltourist blog along with a few of our own) and recommendations of must see and dos. He was also full of surprises and up-graded us to a beautiful bedroom because it was my birthday! I also got a beautiful bouquet of flowers and a delicious cake (I just wish I'd left enough room after the meal to eat it) accompanied by the staff singing happy birthday! A really thoughtful touch!    The staff made us feel more than welcome with a table loaded with milk dates cakes pastries sweets biscuits mint tea fresh orange and moroccan soup and rose water to freshen our hands after the flight.    The riad has a fully stocked bar so relaxing on the roof terrace is a must with a couple of bottles of Casablanca watching the sun go down across the cinnamon rooftops accompanied by a selection of olives and nuts. And you really must try the food here! Tray after tray of the most delicious fare is brought out – a starter of warm flat breads and aubergine salad and then some delicious pastries filled with cheese spinach and meats before cous cous and steaming tagines are delivered. Then if you have enough room is the desert course. All served up by candlelight to the backdrop of distant drums and singing from the square – and if you get the timing right the evening prayers from the mosque right next to you – which is a magical experience. We ate here twice in our three nights in the city as it was that good!    Breakfasts are made for kings – again more courses than you will probably eat in a week; fruit salads yoghurt warm bread and moroccan crepes and you can have eggs any way you like too – we loved the cheese omelettes. They really know how to set you up for a day of exploring!    And about that exploring... Do get out and about! Antonio can book excursions for you through the many contacts he has - we went on the most amazing adventure to the picturesque Imlil in the Atlas Mountains with Hassan culminating with food in his house - a delicious tagine cous cous and salads made by his mother and we also experienced the tea ceremony (which I had the honor of performing under the instruction of Hassan!). They were so welcoming and I don't think they wanted us to leave! Antonio can also book trips for you to the sahara (star-gazing there will be amazing - we're saving that for the next time we go!) and make reservations for you in other recommended restaurants book cars etc.    We loved:  *The whole riad - so beautiful we wanted to stay forever! and you will too!  *The staff – so attentive and the service was outstanding – much better than at an exclusive resort.  * Milk and dates every night as a night cap and fresh water daily  *The free laundry service! Leave whatever needs washing in a basket in your room (aside from underwear) and it appears as if by magic fully laundered on your bed some hours later!  *The tortoise on the roof – he likes to roam about in the day!  *The view – from seeing the sun rise to seeing it set – from the roof terrace  *The packed lunch to go home – as we were flying with Easy Jet they even made us lunch to take on the plane too!  Why on earth would you want to stay in an all-inclusive hotel with its beige and branded decor when you can stay at Dar Anika and have a brilliant totally authentic experience here with staff who care so much about your hard-earned holiday? All in all a highly recommended riad – we can’t wait to go back!,Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Wales,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ronnie09

They arranged a ride from the airport which I definitely recommend however the Riad is conveniently located and not difficult to find. The welcome was so friendly with many delicious snacks soup tea and juice while we filled out paperwork. Then we had time to relax in our beautiful room decorated with rose petals and stocked with more snacks.    We were then given a great detailed description of the city with a map and suggestions. You turn right out of the Riad and down the small road you walk into the main square. It is the perfect location still quiet and easy to find but also very close to the action.

Riad Dar Anika,thehappyhornet wrote a review Feb 2016,50,Spot on (and a great spot),Dar Anika is a beautiful riad in an excellent location at the southern edge of the Medina – a ten-minute stroll from the inspired madness of Jemaa El Fnaa (the main square at the heart of the many winding lanes of the souks).    Upon arrival we were collected from the airport for a short drive to our accommodation. We were then ushered off the hectic streets through an imposing doorway into the peace tranquility and cool of Dar Anika. Having welcomed us with warm smiles and perfect English they sat us down and gave us some complimentary cold drinks snacks and a spiced soup my partner declared to be the best she’d ever eaten.    The friendly and knowledgeable manager Antonio then gave us a handy overview of Marrakech – the main sights how to get around how to deal with ‘false guides’ and such – and helped us quickly create a basic itinerary for our three-night stay.    (This included a day trip to the nearby Atlas mountains for a couple of hours hiking with a Berber guide then a trip to his house to enjoy a traditional meal made by his mother. Hassan and his family were brilliant and if you get the chance go for it – moderate fitness is all you need. Oh and a massive appetite. So. Much. Food.)    Back at the riad our basic room was small-ish but perfectly formed and was cleaned and tidied regularly. If you need clothes cleaned and pressed just pop them in the basket in the wardrobe and it all gets taken care of.    As we visited during a quiet time we were lucky enough to get an upgrade on the second day to a larger room on the first floor. However this room was actually a bit noisier with outside traffic and furniture being moved around upstairs – just to sound super ungrateful.    There’s a rooftop bar and restaurant that we only ate in on our final day (which may have been a mistake as it was excellent) plus a small spa where you can enjoy a hammam and a range of massages (which we absolutely did).    Okay it’s not the cheapest choice for a break in Marrakech. But it is a lovely convenient home from home staffed by warm friendly people who clearly take pride in looking after their guests. And I suspect if we were to visit again in the heat of the spring or summer we’d be even more grateful for this – to coin a cliché – blissful oasis in the heart of hustle and bustle of this ancient city.,Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Harlow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thehappyhornet

Beyond perfection on every level: location (proximate to the center of the old city); hospitality (from the moment you enter you are a valued addition to this unique community of warmth and congeniality); service beyond excellent (an example: immediately before pouring tea my cup was replaced with a warm cup).

The two brothers who own/manage the Riad are very friendly and make you feel like family. There staff are the friendliest I have ever experienced and the service that was offered to us was impeccable. The Riad itself is comparable to staying in a Morrocan palace. The room and amenities were top of the line. The cleaning never disturbed you the turn down service was over the top. There food is very good with little bites offered at anytime of day and the dinner specials changing daily. The meals on the roof top were a great way to start and end your day. The breakfast can claim top five of my life. Lot's of ingredients home made lot's of courses with out you asking and great coffee and eggs .

Riad Dar Anika,Philip C wrote a review Jan 2016,50,Amazing New Year getaway!,We stayed at Dar Anika for four nights over New Year and from the first moment we arrived the staff at Dar Anika made us feel so welcome. Being ushered into an amazing open space inside the riad we were settled down with dates orange juice and little cakes while we got given a great guide as to what to do and see in Marrakech (including what to be wary of very useful for novice travellers!). The room was incredible very individual and oozing with Moroccan charm and again the staff were so kind and helpful - nothing was too much trouble!    Location-wise the riad is ideally located in the old town five minutes stroll to the main square and the souks and surrounded by great places to eat (the best of which are always tucked away but well known to the staff who were great in suggesting restaurants and booking tables). Breakfast in the riad was always outstanding - we'd definitely recommend having it up on the beautiful roof terrace (watch out for the tortoises!). On one of the days we went on a brilliant excursion organised by the riad staff to a Berber village up in the High Atlas via an elaborately served mint tea at Richard Branson's hotel.    Our entire experience at Dar Anika was fantastic and we wouldn't hesitate to recommend this gem of a riad to anyone wanting a taste of true Marrakech.,Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/102philipc

Riad Dar Anika,WhosTheBOS wrote a review Jan 2016,50,Made the best out of what could have been awful,Within hours of arriving at Riad Dar Anika my wife fell on the stairs and broke her foot. While not ideal I am glad this happened at the Riad Dar Anika. The staff were helpful caring and kind. We were on the second floor and the bell staff helped carry my wife up & down the stairs. When a room became available on the first floor they moved us there.    Luckily the food here was very good since we ate almost of all our meals at the hotel.    We ended up returning back to the US after the third night. The manager of the Dar Anika called the other hotels where we had reservations to explain our situation to them and help us get our deposits back. Someone from the hotel dropped my wife's prescription off at the pharmacy and walked me there later to pick it up.    While we did not get to see much of Marrakech the staff here went above & beyond to make sure that my wife & I had what we needed and they were helpful at every turn.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Boston, Massachusetts",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WhosTheBOS

We enjoyed our stay every second we both Arabs and the Riad had a outstanding Oud player who was playing classic Arabic music for three hours everyday from 5pm till 8pm during that the staff were extremely available and they were making sure that we have what we want which they always do.    Marrakech was our third stop and we had some dirty cloths and the riad had a complimentary laundry services which help us a lot.    We haven't tried thier restaurant but the breakfast was great and variant the Moroccan bread is so teasty and flavourful.

Riad Dar Anika,Raksha M wrote a review Jan 2016,50,Wow Riad!!!,We stayed at Riad Dar Anika in December 2015 - I am a well-traveled person and usually we stay at resorts so I was a little apprehensive when I booked our stay at this small boutique hotel. As we walked in through the doors we were greeted by the most friendly staff members. Our adult son was with us and they had probably made arrangements for a young child. Quickly they changed the arrangements for him. The service was impeccable. This Riad is located in the heart of the Medina about 10 minute walk from the square. This Riad is absolutely stunning. You can see they have put real effort in decorating this place. There are comfortable sitting areas for the guests. The manager Antonio and the owner Abu went out of their way to make our stay comfortable. Any time we were relaxing we would be treated to fresh juices nuts dates milk etc.... Breakfast was the best we had during our trip - it was served on their beautiful rooftop. Everything was made fresh - The lady sat on the terrace and made different things (some morrocan) on the pan. She was very passionate about how she made it and served it. My husband and I are both vegetarian so Abu and Antonio both took extra special care to find good restaurants for us that had good selection of vegetarian food. The square is about a 10 minute walk from Dar Anika and we felt safe walking from the square even after midnight... Be sure to have their Hamam bath - it is quite an experience - I asked them to book me a hair dresser to style my hair after the bath. Not only did they arrange for somebody but it was complimentary. Nothing was too much to ask for. They packed us some great fresh fruits and baked wares for our flight. Abu remembered I liked Pomegranate so they had packed couple of boxes of pomegranate seeds!!!

From the moment I walked in I was treated like royalty. The attention to detail and to the individual are outstanding. I highly recommend experiencing the Hamman and dinner there. Both were delicious. This is the kind of place where they think of everything and want you to get the most out of your stay. You want for nothing- I was even told that if there was fruit that I wanted from outside of the riad they would source it and clean it for me (complementary)- not that I could have fit anything else in after the plentiful meals. I even got a packed lunch for my long flight home. The only downside was that I was only there for one night.,Date of stay: January 2016,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Sydney, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DKap72

Riad Dar Anika,MermanSF wrote a review Jan 2016,50,"Dar Anika in unique, not like anything you have ever seen before",Dar Anika has elevated service and caring about their costumers to a whole new level. A degree of service you have never seen even if you are well-travelled and have stayed at a lot of luxury hotels! Located in the heart of the Medina one minute walk from your car drop-off there is the highlight of your trip to Morocco! You open the door at the end of this small dead-end ally and enter a new world! The building is simply gorgeous and to me the architecture was different that other riads with beautiful ceiling paintings etc. The covered courtyard area/ lobby is candle lit and has a special feel with a small pool and lots of seating for guests to relax and enjoy a drink or chill. You get a warm welcome from the assistant manager and the manager Antonio and a very helpful “Marrakech 101” lecture! Rooms are cozy and comfy. I asked for a room change and even-though I was there for the New Years Eve and the hotel was full they made it happen. Their staff moved everything for me and I didn’t even have to lift a finger ☺ Breakfast was the best I had during my trip and it is served on their beautiful rooftop. Everything was fresh and pancakes were made right there on the rooftop. Dar Anika is simply excellent and makes your stay special.

Riad Dar Anika,Andrjotom wrote a review Jan 2016,50,Outstanding,The many previous positive reviews reflect our experience when we were lucky enough to spend our honeymoon at Riad Dar Anika in the summer. This really is a superb place to stay with a perfect balance of professional attentiveness by the staff when anything is needed and privacy when not.    The location is excellent the roof top terrace and atrium are wonderful spaces especially for breakfast (which certainly sets you up for the day!) and to unwind in the evening. We can also recommend the Hammam and using the pool.    From the initial welcome to the organisation of our departure (complete with a packed lunch for our journey back) and everything in between made our experience in Marrakech a pleasure.    We would really like to Thank Abu and the other staff members there who helped make it a fantastic few days it was all the little extras that made it special and sets this hotel apart from many others large and small that we have stayed in.

The rooms can be a bit dark (as is the case in this kind of structure) but are well appointed and decorated with comfortable bathrooms and seating areas.  The staff are extremely accommodating about everything including helping you find your way around the medina (and you're right in it).  The food was rather mediocre but lots of good meals are available in the medina so it shouldn't be a problem.

The party on New Year's Eve was great fun - belly dancer traditional Berber ladies with an amazing sound a very good ""Morracan Ed Sheeran"" and a woman who danced with a tray full of lit candles on her head ! Food wine and a great fun had by all. Next day it was a mixture of Hammam massage and manicure with some time around the Souks the. An evening of star gazing in the desert .... Amazing .. Really amazing. Best day it was into th Atlas Mountains for a days trek and lunch in the local Berber village - once again amazing and the people are genuinely pleased you are there and so very friendly.    The Riad staff get 11/10 all day long as do anyone they bring in to take you in the excursions or just the airport.

The welcome when we arrived when the Director Antonio informed us about Marrakech and recommended us excursions restaurants etc. The service was wonderful during all our stay. The breakfast great and always with flexibility regarding the time we would like to take it. When we came back from our day out we where always received with a smile. We received a very personalized service and attentions and we even receive some sandwiches and fruits when we left our hotel so we could eat them in our flight back to Spain.  It is as well very good located in medina near the big square. With the advantage that taxis can drive you to the door (which it does not happen with most of the riads in Medina).

There's a lot that's been covered in prior reviews; from the fast free wifi through the ultra-cleanliness and to the outstanding breakfasts. However it's the staff and management that really make this somewhere special to stay. Here's ONE example - we had a reservation at a restaurant that was in the middle of the souks - not easy to get to. When we asked for directions at the Riad Antonio instead spent 20 minutes walking us to it and making sure we learnt the way to get back as we went.

The riad itself is well situated to explore the best of Marrakesh and is a lovely little oasis of calm and tranquility to return to after a frenetic day spent in the markets and noisy streets of the city.

Riad Dar Anika,LouJ1001 wrote a review Dec 2015,50,highly recommend - perfect,"At the end of a small road 5 minutes walk from the main square - far enough to be away from the noise but near enough to wander into the souks. We were welcomed with a single rose goats milk & dates mint tea & biscuits and soup..what at welcome! Antonio kindly showed us a map of the town and where to go (and avoid!) - without any pressure to sell or gain anything for the hotel. The room was simply lovely - we booked the superior suite - and it certainly was. A huge dome over the 4-poster bed open log fire facing seating. The shower room was spacious with local bath product (note only shower gel soap and shampoo) - which smelt of chocolate!  Breakfast served 8-10am anywhere you wanted - we chose the roof terrace - set with table and chairs covered with white linen. Breakfast was fresh bread and crepes made in front of you honey jam yoghurt with fresh fruit (pomegranate / apple) freshly squeezed orange hot coffee cake...it goes on! We ate at the Riad on one night and were given a table in the courtyard and served amazing turkey tagine (well it was Christmas Day!). The dinner price was really reasonable and wine normal UK restaurant prices.  Jamil our server was simply wonderful. He could not do enough for us and was completely welcoming and always with a smile. He recommended places for us to visit and showed us on the map - understanding that not all tourists want to see the souks.  The morning we left - the Riad organised a taxi for us (22euros) - which was a private car not a taxi as we were expecting. Jamil had set up breakfast for us even though it was 6.30am! - and lit the fire in the courtyard as it was cold in the morning. All the staff came to say goodbye to us (and this was nothing to do with wanting a tip - it really was just to say goodbye). We were however a little confused when we were ready to left but were asked to stay...after 5 minutes we were handed fresh bread sandwiches and fruit...""for your journey home""...which was a beautiful parting thought.  Most afternoons we took advantage of the upper roof terrace (seating for 4) and had drinks - served with olives and nuts to looked out over to the main square and city walls.

Riad Dar Anika,Marianne J wrote a review Dec 2015,50,Weekend in Morrocco,My friends and I scheduled a trip to Morocco many months ago and then after the multiple incidents of terrorism around the globe had some hesitation about our trip to Marakech which was then days away. We needn't have worried. Our hotel took extra care in making us feel welcome and safe. The rooms and interior of the hotel were lovely and we had a marvellous tangine dinner upon arrival after the hotel's driver fetched us from the airport on the first night. The subsequent days we had a tour of the city and a road trip to see a local waterfall both which were arranged by the hotel. This was excessively helpful as it took the worry and effort away from us. In fact the hotel staff was great about helping us with anything we wanted- whether it be a camel ride dinner at a specific restaurant or suggestions for what to do next. Also the guides they arranged for us were very good. Our city guide showed us around and treated us like his own daughters he even helped us negotiate in the souk rather than just take a commission off our purchases. Our mountain guide was also very good and practically carried one of my less adventurous friends over the rocky terrain. We also had massages organised for us at the hotel which were also very good and the owner was so kind as to pack us a to go dinner for our flight since he knew we were on easy jet and therefore not likely to get anything onboard. All in all a great stay and would highly recommend this hotel. Some housekeeping items: it's about a 10 minute walk to the souk from the hotel well located and easy to find easy access by car (although no parking) which is useful for taxi drop off and the call for prayer in the morning is extremely loud so would suggest ear plugs if this will bother you - for us it was just part of the experience of being in Morocco.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/72mariannej

On our arrival we were taken to a comfortable reception room (with a log fire) given tea biscuits and even soup - that's what I call a good check-in! The room was lovely clean and well equipped and had nice touches like rose petals tastefully scattered on the bed and table tops. The bed itself was very comfortable and we slept well. Other nice touches were daily fresh fruit and bottled water (the cold tap water was treated and drinkable).  Overall the riad was wonderful; spotlessly clean and very relaxing. The rooftop terrace was very pleasant with its potted plants sun beds Berber tent tortoises strolling around and had a nice view of the Marrakech skyline.  We ate a tasty Morrocan breakfast on the terrace with bread baked by a lady on a hotplate (the bread not the lady). The afternoon tea and cakes were lovely as was the fresh fruit juice brought to our room daily. After checking out the other local restaurants we decided to have dinner at the riad and were so pleased we did and ate the next night too. Lamb wasn't on the menu and we asked if they had some available could we have it instead; and the manager said if they didn't then they would go out and get some - great service.

Informed the Riad by e-mail prior to travel to keep it a surprise. Well - that was it! The staff and Anotonio the manager could not do enough for us. Our two daughters arrived a day later as a surprise and the plan was executed to the tee by the management - and what a surprise it was!    I was worried that my 2 young daughters in their early 20s may find the Riad a bit small and without excitment. How wrong was I. One of them stated that she did not want to come back home!    Antonio's detailed guidance on etiquette and things to do in Marrakech and the advice on the trips not only helped us save some money but also added to the whole amazing experience. Thank you!!    The staff were equally fantastic and nothing was too much trouble. We truly felt like Royalty!!    We ate at the Riad on one of our nights and it was truly special. The setting service ambience the shesha etcetc- we could not have asked for more. Even if you do not stay here please make sure you spend an evening at the Riad - it truly is an experience!    We visited the Atlas mountains and trekked up to see the waterfall. Hassan our guide was brilliant. The best part of that day was the meal that Hassan's mum and family had prepared and laid out for us in their house. We were truly humbled by the hospitality and warmth of the family. What made it even more special was that the kids from the family and practically the whole neighbourhood descended on us and we enjoyed true local Berber culture and food. Anotonio as usual had not missed any detail and had duly informed Hassan that it was my husband's birthday on that day. Well! A cake arrived after our 'lavish' lunch - baked in true Morrocan style oven. There was even a candle on it and the cake was decorated with twigs. They had even managed to put my husband's name on it!!! All in a completely rural setting! Thank you Hassan and family. My husband stated that that was the best birhday present he could ask for    The restaurants recommended by Antonio were brilliant.    Can't stop bragging about this Riad.

We travelled with 3 kids; 2 teenagers and a 9 year old. From the moment we stepped into the Riad we were pampered and cared for. Our three children stayed in a very comfortable room with 3 beds and we stayed in an adjacent room. The kids enjoyed the hotel and pool so much that they didn't want to leave! My youngest daughter had melon one night and loved it. The waiter would go out each evening to bring fresh melon just for her! When my kids got tired of eating couscous and tanginess the staff prepared a special meal for them. On our first night the staff provided us with a detailed map and guide of the city with restaurant recommendations and shopping advice.

Riad Dar Anika,Ssd529 wrote a review Nov 2015,50,Amazing and wonderful!,What a beautiful Riad! I would strongly suggest you stay here for an authentic Moroccan experience; much more wonderful than the sterile and Americanized Four Seasons which we also visited. Everyone at this Riad was so welcoming and so very helpful. The bedrooms were cozy and soundproof. The bathrooms very clean. The included breakfasts were delicious. We had dinner at Dar Anika one night and the food was excellent. All the recommendations of our hosts were excellent; the dinners what we must not miss in Marakeesh and a great lunch cafe. They booked us an authentic and wonderful hammam massage. The ONLY negative of our entire visit was that the tour guide that they helped us hire spoke English with such a thick accent he was hard to understand. Other than that ONE thing I'd say our experience with Dar Anika could not have been better. Oh! One I couldn't get my phone to find the Riad wifi and the front desk fixed my iphone for me...wow!

It is located at the south end of the Medina perfect for exploring old town by foot but a taxi stand is also close by. We loved our stay form the moment we stepped through the front door.We were welcomed with tea a local soup and tasty snacks. A map and helpful tips on how to get around were provided. Support with finding places or booking restaurants was available throughout. The beautiful roof terrace is an additional highlight. One can have breakfast or dinner on the roof but there is also space for lounging and relaxing any time of the day up there.

Riad Dar Anika,Cynthia-Homayoun wrote a review Nov 2015,50,Stay nowhere else in Marrakesh,Dar Anika is an outstanding oasis in bustling Marrakesh. From the moment you arrive you are treated as someone very special: seated in a lovely lounge with fresh dates and milk then mint tea and biscuits then a lovely homemade Moroccan soup then rosewater on your hands and a cool towel for your neck. Wow. What attention to detail and beauty. Our room was decorated artfully with rose petals- tasteful Moroccan style furnishings. Book the hammam experience. A delightful bathing ritual where my husband and I in bathing suits were scrubbed and bufffed. Breakfast on the rooftop is another delight. We had the pleasure of meeting both Antonio(the manager) and Abu ( the proprietor) who were the most charming hospitality professionals we have ever encountered.

We arrived early in the day and were welcomed by the manager who was always present and helpful and the extremely friendly staff who served us a great breakfast without us asking for it!  After that the manager gave us a little talk about what to see what to do and how to behave in the city.  Our room was cosy clean and always made tidy after a long day in the medina.  The rooftopbar made a nice getaway from the noisy streets and there were plenty of opportunities for ending a good spot for relaxing etc. The food was perfect as well the breakfast overwhelming and authentic and the evening dinners delicious (they even made us a special dish as we asked for!)

Riad Dar Anika,Neil H wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Fantastic Service,This riad is perfectly placed to explore the old city just south of the main square. It is the archetypal riad an unprepossessing exterior hiding a beautifully tranquil interior with a lovely terrace above the hustle & bustle of the streets below.    However what really sets this riad apart is the fantastic service given by the owners and staff. They really couldn't do enough to help us enjoy our stay in Marrakech - restaurant recommendations were always spot-on invaluable advice on how to avoid the tourist pitfalls (especially on what to pay and where to go) and a willingness to source whatever we needed from fruit to day trips just to make our stay more pleasant.

Riad Dar Anika,ushmac wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Outstanding stay - would come back again without a second thought. A true diamond of a hotel,Ok so what really sets this riad apart from others is the faultless service. The kindess of the owners and the nothing is too much trouble attitude. I always say a few things are important when in Africa:    Room and hotel Hygiene - exceptional I think my room was cleaned at least three times daily. The hotel and rooms themselves are large well equipped and comfortable.    Hotel services and facilities are excellent. As I say nothing is to much trouble and the owners and staff make sure you enjoy your stay. I had the hammam there and it was excellent.    Food quality - Abu (the owner said set aside an hour or more for breakfast) he wasn't kidding the food was gorgeous and abundant. My only regret about this trip was not having dinner at the hotel every evening it smelt and looked amazing and if breakfast was anything to go by it would have been stunning    Hotel location: 5 minutes from all the sights and the main square plus in a very safe area and no alleyways to wander down. In fact it was impossible to get lost and easy to find. One thing we have discovered is spending a busy day in the medina requires a quiet retreat that you can pop back to when you need a moment.    Knowledge: Local knowledge and advice was spot on and as a result Abu ensured we had as much fun as we expected.    My husband is used to staying at the Jumeriah hotels and this was more than equal to that standard if not better. He is a picky traveller and I was worried he wouldn't have a great time Abu and Abu (the owners) made sure he did. Our daily chats with them made our stay all the more special. Just as a final note when I say nothing is too much trouble it really isn't They sourced cactus fruit for me because I wanted to try it My Mum had asked for nuts from morocco she loves them they got that too and also gave me enough argan oil to last me till my next trip. I cannot find anything to fault them on it truly was an outstanding experience.    Marrakech is a fabulous city and a stay at Dar Anika just adds to that making for a truly relaxing and perfect stay.    We loved it so much we will be back again next year.

Riad Dar Anika,630spike wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Excellent Customer Service,The staff at the Riad went out of their way to make the stay of my husband and I and my mother perfect in every way. The two brothers both called Abu who own the Riad were excellent. My husband lost a screw out of his glasses and Abu senior sourced him a pair of cheap reading glasses . We were given advice on the best restaurants to visit and a lovely day out with driver was organised for us. We ate in a couple of nights- the food was good and Abu even gave us a picnic to take to the airport for the journey home    My mother is elderly and generally manages stairs well. However the Riad had very steep winding stairs ( the sort that are wide on outside and narrow on inside) which were dimly lit with no handrail. Really they were totally unsuitable for an elderly person. It isn't the fault of the Riad - but if it had been made clearer I would not have taken my mother there.,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Northwich, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/630spike
Riad Dar Anika,LondonCarro wrote a review Oct 2015,50,A perfect long weekend,What a gem! This was my third time to Marrakesh (second with my husband) and Abu & Abu offered a unique perspective at a point when I thought I'd already seen the best it had to offer. They sat with us the morning we arrived and helped to plan an itinerary pointing out the best shops cafes and restaurants that we hadn't sniffed out ourselves. The staff were unbelievably attentive and anticipated what we might want before we even knew ourselves (often an addictive mint lime granita style iced drink!). The breakfasts up on the sunny roof terrace were epic to say the least with the local breads cooked up on a stove in front of us every morning. The Riad location was perfect just inside the old city 10 mins walk to the main square but also a matter of meters to a spot where a car could easily access and whisk you off to a day trip to the mountains - convenience not to be underestimated. We also enjoyed a lovely hamman the day we left with a wonderful therapist one of the most smily and warm I've encountered.

Riad Dar Anika,Erica S wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Exceptional hotel with fabulous service,I do not normally write reviews of hotels but I have to make an exception for Riad Dar Anika because it was truly exceptional. My husband and I spent 3 nights there and we could not possibly have been happier. The room was lovely (the rose petals strewn on the bed when we arrived very late at night and the cookies waiting for us were charming touches). The restaurant on the rooftop terrace was wonderful. All that and the Riad is in the heart of the city close to every place we wanted to visit -- easy walking distance to all the sites within the Medina.    And the service was outstanding. We had complicated travel arrangements because our flights were rescheduled several times and finally arrived very late -- well past midnight. But through it all with each change of arrival time Abu the owner of the Riad assured us that we would be met at the airport (and we were) and assuaged any worries we had. Despite our very late arrival at the Riad (after 3 in the morning) there was staff on hand to show us to our room.    During our entire visit Abu went out of his way to make our stay as enjoyable as possible helping us to plan our touring recommending restaurants advising us on how to haggle with the vendors in the souks and even providing us with a bag lunch on the day we left to take the train to Casablanca). We really felt that Abu (and all the staff) cared about us as guests.    The only downside to this visit is that we are now totally spoiled.

Riad Dar Anika,AMFaz wrote a review Oct 2015,50,World class welcome,Dar Anika is a tranquil oasis in the madness of the Median in Marrakech. Abu and Abu are the brothers who between them - and their staff - make you feel completely at home from the minute you enter through the door. We were lucky enough to spend a whole week here 10-17th October and I can honestly say it was like staying in someone's home along with members of the family who simply couldn't do enough for you! Restaurants were booked for us minutes before a taxi was arranged to whisk us off and pick us up at any pre-arranged time. The Restaurant was specifically recommended by Abu (senior) as he made it his priority to make sure no-one had their holiday spoilt by an upset tummy. Each day after wandering through the warren of souks and back streets we were welcomed back with a large jug of cold water mint and lime ice drinks and a delicious cake of our choice (all complimentary). I could go on and on but most of what I'd put has been said umpteen times over and every word is true. They have wonderful staff even the cleaners are dressed immaculately and give you a huge beaming smile each time you cross paths. I think Abu and Abu have the most incredible sense of what people from all backgrounds expect when they arrive in Marrakech and do everything in their power to make sure you leave with every intention of returning someday......,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AMFaz

The riad is traditional and full of Morrocan flavour and our room was gorgeous. There seems to be only a fair mark up on the excellent services like the hammam spa experience and I'd definitely recommend a guide to take you through the city's monuments.

Riad Dar Anika,Rose F wrote a review Sep 2015,50,A secret oasis in Marrakech,The best place to stay in central Marrakech. Located right in the medina 10-15 minutes walk to the Jamaa el Fna and just across the road from El Badi Palace. The staff were wonderful they treated us like royalty. We were given a full 3 course lunch before we'd even checked in!  There were lots of restaurants nearby but the food in the hotel was incredible as well we sat alone in the lounge area eating by candle light it was so romantic.  We also spent a long time relaxing on the roof-top terrace watching the world go by and being waited on hand and foot!  The hotel also offered an indoor pool and massage facilities but we didn't have time to try them out.

The hotel is located right at the entrance to the market area and gives one a sense of the real Marrakech. Food service is available at ALL hours; transportation can be arranged and is very efficient; and the concierge services are quite competent.

From the moment we arrived the service was first class and nothing was too much for the excellent staff. We have stayed in many 5 star hotels world wide and the Dar Anika matched or surpassed all of them for personal service.  The air conditioned rooms are tastefully decorated the beds comfortable and bathrooms had plenty of hot water.  All the food served on the terrace was also first class.  All in all a thoroughly delightful experience.

Riad Dar Anika,Jordan A wrote a review Sep 2015,50,An outstanding welcome to Morocco,Your first time into a country can often unfairly dictate whether or not you ever decide to return again. In that sense Dar Anika can safely say it's left me with a glowing impression of a city and a country that I will be sure to visit again.    Situated in a prime location in the old town of Marrakech you find yourself in the epicenter of the busting city streets and yet the Riad is an oasis of tranquility and luxury. Welcomed with refreshments upon our arrival the manager - Abu - duly took the time to introduce us to Marrakech taking a full 20 minutes to brief us on what to do and where to go on our stay. The map he gave us was invaluable we used it the entire trip. You can expect this throughout your stay: the staff are always friendly welcoming and accommodating food is aplenty and the room is cleaned multiple times a day helping you relax in between the aforementioned hectic strolls through the souks and in the heat.    I cannot recommend this Riad enough thank you to all the staff for a wonderful trip and I look forward to returning.,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/465jordana
Riad Dar Anika,Ross H wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Sets the bar for service,My wife and I absolutely fell in love with this place after a 5 night stay. The staff there could not have done more to make our trip to Marrakech perfect. The concierge had contacted us via e-mail to make sure everything was arranged before we arrived; airport transfer hammam dinner guide - check.  The rooms are simple decorated tastefully and give an authentic feel. However the whole ethos of the place is to get you out of the rooms and exploring the city or enjoying mint tea on the balcony or a bottle of wine on the terrace. On our first morning (after a superb hammam) the owner sat down with us to walk us through our itinerary he gave us some wonderful recommendations but most importantly made us street wise with some tips and tricks. He was genuinely concerned that we made the most of our time and the rest of the staff there really follow his lead.  The breakfast each morning is nothing short of a feast with any left overs going to the very tame resident birds and tortoises. I'm pretty sure they will serve you breakfast whenever you wake up be it morning or afternoon. After that you are set to explore the city all of which is right on the doorstep a turn left and you are in the souks or a 5 min walk to the right to visit the palaces.  I cannot stress enough how well we were looked after by all during our stay it really does set the bar for service.,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/811rossh

We dined in the riad on a number of nights as the food was good and service excellent. WiFi was variable but there is an alternative network in the reception area that seemed reliable.

Riad Dar Anika,Charles A wrote a review Aug 2015,50,Best Riad we have found so far,This is our fourth visit to Morroco in the last year and my wife and I enjoy staying in Riads rather than hotels as they have a more authentic feel and tend to give better and friendlier service.    Riad Dar Anika is without doubt the best of the eight or so we have tried so far.    The service is simply superb from the first moment with a host of courtesy details too numerous to detail. Milk and dates (a Berber welcoming custom) and Morrocan mint tea served while your bags are taken to your room is just the first example.    It is a short and fascinating walk (600m) to the famous square yet only a few yards from the road crossing the Medina so a taxi can drop you at the door where a bellboy will take charge of your bags. A public car park is only 100m away if you have your own transport.    We were in a Deluxe Riad Double Room on the first floor overlooking the street and it was perfect. We had a refreshing swim in the pool followed by a warm shower to recover from our long and hot journey.    We had breakfast upstairs in the lovely rooftop garden and that was delicious and very complete. We spent just the one night there but we would have loved to stay longer    If you are planning to visit Marrakech try to spend at least one night at Riad Dar Anika.

Riad Dar Anika,LeeThomson1984 wrote a review Aug 2015,50,"Beautiful Riad, Great Location and Excellent Service",When our flight was delayed by several hours due to a storm which meant we didn't arrive in Marrakech until past midnight we were amazed that not only was our transport from the airport to the Riad still waiting for us with a smile on his face but the staff had stayed up until the early hours to ensure we could enjoy the dinner we had also already booked.    This really set a high bar for the kind of service we would receive for the rest of our stay and they never once let us down.    Mr. Abu is amazing. Visiting the main square and the souks can be a taunting task but Mr. Abu was able to provide us with a guide for the day but he had also circled on a map of the local area the places to go and the places to avoid.    We only had three days in Marrakech so our first morning at the Riad Mr. Abu talked to us about what we were hoping to accomplish from our stay and he put together a comprehensive itinerary which allowed us to enjoy the local attractions and activities we had been hoping to do and we were given a driver for two days to help us get around.    The staff were also very attentive and go above and beyond in making sure you are comfortable and are enjoying your stay. One evening after I had gotten ill from eating within the square - something Mr. Abu had warned me not to do - the staff put together a wonderful light dinner for me to enjoy and were all very helpful and I felt they were genuinely concerned about my well-being shown by the fact they provided me a complimentary dinner and a packed lunch to help me get better.    As for the Riad itself it was a wonderful escape from the busy and hectic streets just outside. This Riad is in the thick of it and you may think before entering that the area maybe too noisy to be able to relax however this just wasn't the case. The moment you walk through the doors you enter a calm and palatial area that is the perfect place to unwind after a busy day of shopping and the rooms are quiet and allow you to get a great nights sleep so you are ready to face another day of activities.    So to sum up loved staying here the staff were just amazing the location is perfect for those who want to be in the thick of it and the Riad is a wonderful place to stay.    Thank you to Mr. Abu and the Team for all your efforts and I couldn't have asked for more.    P.S.

Riad Dar Anika,Adam wrote a review Aug 2015,50,"An absolutely first-rate experience. Staff, amenities and accommodation are beyond exceptional.",We chose to come to Marrakech for my girlfriend's 30th birthday and wanted a place that would give us an authentic experience without compromising the comforts of a good hotel. Not only did Riad Dar Anika deliver they completely blew away our expectations. We spent four nights here during our adventure and are literally broken up over having to leave. In such a short amount of time Mr. Abu's staff make you feel like family a sense that is accentuated by the immaculate and intimate setting and supremely generous amenities (including complimentary drinks laundry and breakfast).    Upon our arrival we were met by Zineb and Fatimah who showed us to the solar where we were served a delicious spread of local fare. Mr. Abu (the riad's proprietor along with his brother also named Abu) then spent an hour (AN HOUR!) with us pouring over a map of the city outlining the neighborhoods highlighting must-see historical sites good shopping in the medina and the best restaurants and lounges in the new city. Most importantly he gave us a thorough run-down of do's and don'ts and helped us save time and dirham (Moroccan dollars) during our excursions. I've not experienced this level of personal attention and service in all of my travels.    Our rooms were immaculate traditionally decorated and immensely comfortable. Though not overly large they have all of the conventional modern necessities. On our second day Mr. Abu upgraded us at no cost simply because he had what he considered to be a better room available. While we were happy with both we were shocked and pleased at such unbridled generosity.    There is so much to see and do in Marrakech but at the end of each day we were always happy to come back to Dar Anika to get a respite from the bustle of the streets. We would always find fresh milk and dates laid out in our room with the bed and linens freshly changed and turned down. We relaxed in the central courtyard complete with a plunge pool and reading room ideal for escaping the Marrakchi heat or unwinding before bed. The rooftop restaurant and garden serves exceptional Moroccan dinners (try the tanjia or any of the tagines - they are perfect) and breakfast with a French twist. They have beautiful flora and climbing roses adorning this outdoor space where you can watch the city on all sides or rest in the shade of a Berber tent. Perhaps best of all a family of desert tortoises live on the roof and ramble about charmingly munching on foliage while you drink your coffee and watch them.    At all times and for no charge you can have freshly-baked cakes and pastries (made in-house by the kitchen staff daily) Moroccan tea or coffee a glass of excellent Moroccan wine - seriously good stuff try anything from Volubilia vineyards from near Meknes - or a tray of local olives and peanuts prior to dinner. The staff will handle anything you need and contracts with excellent local livery to provide transportation. They professionally handled managing excursions exchanging our US dollars (at a decent rate no less) and coordinating reservations. They are always present but never overbearing and seem to have a great emotional intelligence about them. Nearly all are fluent or competent in English French and Arabic making us feel right at home even 3600 miles from Manhattan. Finally the location of the Dar Anika only a half-kilometer from the legendary Jemma al-Fna square and even closer to Bahia Palace and the Saadien Tombs is perfect for really getting to know Marrakech. We were never more than 15 minutes walk from the major attractions within the walls of the medina and only a short taxi-ride from the party in the New City.    I cannot come up with a single negative thing to say about this place. We have been to La Mamounia and explored a few other properties in the city and it is BY FAR the most successful at marrying authenticity and modern luxury in the heart of the Medina.,Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theoriginaltheory
Riad Dar Anika,SamuelFamilyBethesda wrote a review Aug 2015,50,Outstanding! Unparalleled service!,It's not often that you stay in an oasis of calm and beauty like Dar Anika. I could go on and on about the incredibly high level of service but I will just share one example which demonstrates Abu and team's level of commitment to guest service. Our 7 year old son came down with a very bad stomach bug after 9 pm one night. When we told Abu and asked for the nearest pharmacy he didn't just give us directions but instead drove my husband via his motorbike to the one pharmacy open some ways from the center of town. He even offered to lend Joe local currency in the event Joe didn't have it on him. I've stayed in many many hotels around the world and have never experienced the level of care for our family. That experience plus the very detailed review of our needs and itinerary along with very helpful tips for navigating the city a beautiful facility etc etc are the reasons why I can wholeheartedly recommend Dar Anika to all.,Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bethesda, Maryland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SamuelFamilyBethesda

Riad Dar Anika,westendbar wrote a review Aug 2015,50,5 Star +,We said goodbye to Riad Dar Anika last Saturday after spending a week there. We were very sorry to leave. It felt like we were saying farewell to family. Riad Dar Anika has left a very special impression of Marrakesh within us and one we will not be forgetting anytime soon.  From getting picked up from the airport by the Riads's driver Abdelatif we had other than 5* first class service and from then on it only got better As we stepped through the doors from the chaotic buzz of the streets of the Medina into a magical little palace where we were treated like the King and Queen of Riad Dar Anika.  On our first morning we had a warm welcoming meeting where we put together our holiday itinerary of what we wanted from our stay. We dined at some of the best restaurants chilled at trendy local bars and other days escaped to the country. A real mix of Marrakech thanks to Riad Dar Anika. Our best times were spent in the Riad. We swam soaked up the sun and had a hammam and massage. The food in the Riad was exploding with flavour - Recommend the Lamb Tagine and agree with the other reviewers - it really was the best Tagine in Marrakech!!  You will want for nothing at this magnificent Riad iced water as you step through the door light refreshments shortly followed with some fruit. You will not go hungry here that’s for sure  and if you don’t like what is being served they will simply change it to your own personal liking. Forgot something? Just ask – they will go that second and bring back that hairbrush you stuipidly left back home  Also the Riad is fully equipped – travel plug adaptors/ book lights toiletries – they have it all.  To the marvelous maids who tidied our room twice a day!!! The kind and friendly young men who served us day to day where nothing seemed like too much trouble. To Latif and Fadwa for always welcoming us home with a gorgeous smile and to Mr Abu for ensuring our weeks stay was one not to forget in a hurry for your time and concern we thank each and every one of you for giving us the best holiday experience we have ever had. We look forward to visiting again sometime soon we hope ,Date of stay: July 2015,,Airdrie,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/westendbar

The owners managers and staff cannot do enough for you to make you comfortable.    Our visit began with welcome treats as described by others (absolutely delicious) and then an introduction to Marrakesh provided by Abu and Abu. They were so kind to provide information recommendations and advice. It was extremely professional and helpful without being intrusive. They made recommendations for attractions and restaurants to visit. They were all great and worthwhile.    The hotel was extremely comfortable - especially the pool on days when the mercury hit 52. When we returned to the riad there were always refreshing beverages brought to us poolside.    We ate dinner at Dar Anika on our first night. It was absolutely delicious. The breakfasts each day were fabulous. Moroccans do bread very well! Yum!!    On the morning we departed (very early) staff came in to prepare breakfast and they then sent us off with a packed lunch. Unbelievable service.    If you are going to Marrakesh just stay here. The Medina is crazy and you could choose to stay in a more western hotel in the new city but why bother?

Riad Dar Anika,LAgirlinNY wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Utopia in Morocco,From the second we walked in every single detail was perfect. We came to this hotel at the end our time in Morocco and had stayed in a few small riads and village hotels up to that point. The reviews were pretty spot on in retrospect but really nothing prepared me for the amazing experience in this hotel. The staff greeted us at the door on arrival and brought us a rose then took us into an air conditioned lounge for tea and snacks. The hotel is beautifully decorated in all the common areas and in the room. But the real gem is the staff and service. They are so attentive! I mean they literally made ANY request come true. I had even asked about a specific Moroccan dessert I wanted to try but had not found anywhere and they made it for me that evening with dinner! We also used their hammam services dipped in the pool and layed out on the terrace rooftop. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to have a beautiful tranquil 5 star service hotel experience in Marrakech (which is anything but tranquil outside those walls).

Riad Dar Anika,Cr0wlondaPr0wl wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Magic in the Medina!,I cannot say enough nice things about this hotel and the staff. We wanted for nothing during our stay and they exceeded our expectations at every point.    We arranged a driver from the airport that was prompt and friendly.    Upon arrival as others have mentioned we met with Abu and Abu. They gave us a detailed breakdown of places to eat/drink and things to see. As this conversation was happening we were served a tremendous amount of food and drink- from tea milk dates soup mint iced drink and much more. The service was outstanding.    We had booked a double bed regular room which was beautifully appointed but small. A room for those looking to see the city. We were upgraded to a larger room with a larger bed and bathroom. One thing to note: the shampoo they give you is amazing. I took some home because it was outstanding.    We ate dinner at the riad for three nights of our stay outstanding. I reviewed their kitchen separately.    Rooms have excellent AC for relief from the hot sun.    Location is excellent- in the medina near the palaces a five minute walk to the Jemaa and a hidden oasis amongst the hustle and bustle.    Free wifi that was excellent in terms of reliability. The riad had three floors. The main floor: with reception posh sitting area pool rooms and hammam. I would highly recommend their hammam services at the beginning of your stay. The pool was great after a day of sightseeing. The second floor: rooms balcony sitting areas. We enjoyed time up here drinking and eating some amazing things. The kitchen here is insane. The third floor/roof: sitting area Berber tent lounge/sun chairs and a taller sitting area. There are also the resident turtles who visited us during breakfast. We spent time on the roof to enjoy the sunset and storms off on the horizon.    A word on breakfast: it is free. It is amazing. It is fresh. Leave an hour. At least. It was a nice way to ease into the day.    We were here celebrating our anniversary and they surprised us with a song cake and flowers.    Overall magic. I cannot remember looking at a staff member and not seeing a smile for the entire week we were here.    Note: they book excursions and car services.

My family of 10 were the only guests until the final night when another couple arrived. The staff of 26 under the direct supervision of the owners Abu and his brother were incredible. Ridiculously attentive gracious and trained. The food for every meal was of the highest quality. We only ordered the light dinner as it was more than enough food. ( we would have wasted so much of the other menu). Wine and spirits and cigars are available. Follow Abu's advice about do's and don'ts. Trust me!

Riad Dar Anika,traveller-eater wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Fantastic,Looking for somewhere for a nice dinner on our last night in Marrakesh we searched TripAdvisor and found this place near the Riad where we were staying. We knocked on the door- and we're transported from the hot and dusty medina to a place of coolness and tranquility. We were offered drinks on the rooftop terrace- or an air conditioned room overlooking the pool-and chose the latter. We stayed there for dinner too as it was so nice. The service was impeccable- and the food simply delicious. From the olives crudités and aubergine pate (with freshly baked moroccan bread) we had with our G+Ts to the moroccan soup and the camel shepherd's pie and chicken pastile it was simply a wonderful meal and the best we had in Morocco. The trifle-type thing we had for dessert was lovely too - but we couldn't do it justice as we were too full by then. The wine list of mainly Moroccan wines (but for the French champagne) was not extensive by European standards but we had sufficient choice to find nice wines to accompany the meal.

Starting from the airport pick up through to the return drop off it was a magical and relaxing stay. When you first enter Dar Anika you instantly know you are somewhere special your bags are taken to your room while you are received in the most luxurious of ways: rose water sprinkled on your hands and a cool cloth to wash away the cares of traveling. You are then brought milk dates cookies to mint tea pastries olives and a refreshingly delicious lime/basil iced beverage.  Dar Anika is owned by two brothers - Abu and Abu and each introduced themselves to me and let me know that when I was settled they would be kind enough to create an itinerary which included recommendations for restaurants and shopping. The location of the raid is perfect....only a 10 minute walk to the Souk El Jadid.  My room was outstanding comfortable bed A/C Argon oil shampoo and body wash and get this...rose petals!! Yup..5 Star living.  The Food!!! Dinner at the Riad which was a delicious choice of Moroccan specialties...try their tangine....you will thank me.

Riad Dar Anika,tgodey46 wrote a review Jul 2015,50,A true jewel in the Medina,There are not enough words to describe Dar Anika but one that comes to mind most frequently is perfection. I have stayed in several five star luxury hotels and nothing comes close to the perfection that is Dar Anika and their costumer service. First walking into Dar Anika is like walking into a beautiful oasis among the maze-like alley ways and souks of the Medina. You are led into a lobby off the courtyard wherein you are given a five course welcome reception. Everything from milk dates cookies to mint tea pastries olives and a refreshingly delicious lime/basil iced beverage. Then to top it all off one of the owners (Dar Anika is owned by two brothers - Abu and Abu...so for this review I'll say Abu I and Abu II) Abu I sat down and went over a day by day itinerary with us which included recommendations for restaurants shopping and plotting a tour for us in the Medina. He gave us several cards so we always had the Riad's address and tips on how to handle aggressive street vendors what to pay for photos with snake charmers etc. He took so much time with us and made sure all questions were answered then showed us to our rooms. The rooms were very charming and had beautiful furnishings A/C argan oil shampoo and body wash and the perfect hair dryer! We ate dinner at the Riad which was a delicious array of Moroccan specialities...truly the best meal I had during my stay in Marrakech. Breakfast was equally impressive...an array of Moroccan breads crepes yogurt fruit and eggs made to order along with the freshest orange juice I've ever tasted. At any time there is someone asking if you need anything. They were especially attentive to our nine year old daughter. We meet another family from the states and all nine of us sat in the courtyard and chatted. Next thing we knew we had pitchers of cucumber water and glasses mint tea. I cannot say enough about the service at Dar Anika. Abu I and Abu II have truly perfected what costumer service is all about and I would 100% recommend Dar Anika to anyone staying in Marrakech.,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Baltimore, Maryland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tgodey46
Riad Dar Anika,sadhna a wrote a review Jun 2015,50,WOW!,We stayed at the Dar Anika for 3 nights where we were treated like queens from the moment we were met at the airport by Idriss.  When we got to the Riad we were warmly welcomed by all of the staff with welcome food and drink and a lovely red rose I loved all of the touches around the Riad. Their vegetarian tagine was the best in Morocco.  On our first morning we had a briefing with the owner and discussed what to do whilst in Marrakech and given loads of tips.  The staff organised our Hammam treatment and a massage for us which were lovely experiences.  I would highly recommend staying at the Riad and if I ever returned to Marrakech I would definitely stay there.

Riad Dar Anika,Jo M wrote a review Jun 2015,50,A piece of paradise...,We stayed in Dar Anika for three nights. Upon arrival were greeted like royalty with mint tea water a cocktail and nibbles in an air conditioned luxurious room which was very welcome treat after such a long journey!    Our room was comfortable a deluxe twin it was street side which was a bit of a worry as I am a light sleeper but it wasn't noisy in the end. Comfortable bed and wifi throughout the building.    In the morning Abou and Abou (the owners) talked to us about Marrakech with hints and tips no selling of trips etc as we'd already planned what to do. Very helpful. They even gave us a mobile during our stay for emergency use we presumed as we were two female travellers but it was a nice touch.    We would breakfast on the roof terrace - a mixture of offerings bread fruit pancakes eggs etc very relaxed. We'd always be offered water and a cocktail upon our arrival back from a hot day out. Milk and dates were in the room when we would return after dinner.    All the staff were extremely pleasant and helpful we were waited on and wanted for nothing. We had a hammam and a massage in the Riad during our stay.    This Riad is a very peaceful and calming place to be (we did stay in one more which did not compare) a sanctuary from the hustle of bustle outside. A great place to stay and in particular thanks to Abou and Abou Idriss (our driver) Zineb Latif and Jowet for making it special but quite honestly everyone in the Riad was wonderful! Would totally recommend this to anyone it is a slice of paradise in a very hectic medina!,Date of stay: June 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JosieGirl70
Riad Dar Anika,Scouse_Jeave wrote a review Jun 2015,50,4 days in paradise,We picked this hotel based on the reviews and it still managed to exceed our expectations! From the moment we were picked up by Idriss we were fantastically looked after by everyone in the riad. The 7 course (!!) breakfasts were delicious and the staff were always accommodating and provided anything we needed and more! There was also options to eat lunch and dinner in the riad and snacks were often provided during the day to accompany drinks. It was our first trip to Morocco and Abu(the owner) sat and took time with us drawing us a custom map and highlighting the best points of interest and when to see them. We were guided toward recommended restaurants and cafés so we were really able to make the most of our stay. We highly recommend the riad The location was fantastic as it was only a short walk to the main square so we really felt in the middle of it all nestled in the Medina near the palace. It was lovely to come back to the calm riad after the madness of the city. The rooms were beautifully furnished with fantastic bathroom. Everything was clean with complimentary toiletries and fresh towels and bedding daily. Refreshing cold water was always brought to us several times a day.  The Riad Dar Anika is a tranquil oasis within the bustling medina. Peaceful at night with stunning decor and a roof top garden to fall in love with. Views across the city at sunset are spectacular. All of the staff were polite courteous and very friendly.

On arrival Abu took the time to listen and advise where we should visit & eat.    It's an experience staying here and we loved it.    It's not for everyone staying in the Medinah area but its the true Marrakesh experience.    Will have no problem recommending this hotel to anyone. We also tried the hamman & was excellent!

I was overwhelmed with the hospitality from the very start as I was welcomed with a platter of food and drinks prior to being shown to my room. This place is a jewel and has the mystical feel of Marrakech. A vast contrast from staying in a hotel beautiful decor excellent staff and very welcoming owners.

The surroundings are beautiful and provide a welcoming and peaceful place to relax and be pampered. The food was plentiful and delicious. You can't sit anywhere for more than a few minutes without refreshments being given and snacks to pick at. If you require anything at all the staff will accommodate you. They are always cheerful and happy to help with advice and directions and the enevitable questions about Moroccan culture. After a day in the souks it was so wonderful to step in to the Dar Anika - 'a comfort blanket' sort of feeling.

Riad Dar Anika,S Saxena wrote a review Jun 2015,50,The very best hospitality I've experienced on a holiday,While we did enjoy our trip to Marrakech and what it offered as a city the highlight still remains our experience at Dar Anika. Staying at a riad vs a hotel was the best decision we made and at Dar Anika we experienced possibly the most personable service we've come across on any holiday.    The riad is situated in the south of the Medina (old city) where you will be face to face with the hustle and bustle of city life. Dar Anika is tucked away in the corner of one of the streets and really is like an oasis of peace amongst the chaotic world outside its doors. Its only a 10 minute walk to the main square and is walking distance to several other attractions and restaurants.    When we first entered Dar Anika (they arranged for a taxi transfer from the airport for us on request) we were immediately given fresh milk and dates (a Moroccan tradition) and the owner Abu sat us down and talked through our itinerary with us and what we wanted to get out of our holiday. This was our first taste of the highly approachable and personal nature of service at Dar Anika.    Our room was on the ground floor and a great amount of attention to detail was given to its daily servicing which constantly amazed us. We had daily breakfasts on the terrace and these were of very high quality - the chefs will try to accommodate any dietary requests you may have.    The riad offers excellent excursion packages and Abu is able to talk through these with you and incorporate them into your schedule. We had a personal guide for a half day city tour (Hamid - he was excellent and even helped us with negotiating prices at the markets!) a full day visit to the Atlas Mountains (expensive but worth it) and an excellent Hammam (Turkish bath) at Dar Anika itself.    To conclude Dar Anika has the appearance of a beautiful little paradise and that's exactly how we would describe the experience. To put things into perspective: on my request they arranged for the pool to be surrounded with extra candles and covered in rose petals as a surprise for my partner and followed it up with complimentary sparkling white wine. They also gave us packed lunches for our flight back home....Enough said. Experience it for yourself.

We were picked up from the airport which is only 10/15 minutes away by a very nice driver. As 2 women traveling on our own we were made to feel safe and relaxed. When we arrived we were greeted like royalty by the stuff who welcomed us with red roses and cold drinks and milk and dates. The Riad is utterly charmingfilled with flower pots singing birds and beautiful furniture. While we relaxed on comfortable sofas sipping delicious mint tea we learned about Marrakesh and places to visit and dine. We loved our rooms which were furnished beautifully. I must also mention the delicious breakfast which was served on the gorgeous roof garden. Another fantastic feature of Dar Anika is its proximity to jemaa el fna and the souks and places of interests. But the most important thing that made our stay so special were the staff and Abu and Abu. They were all welcoming warm friendly yet professional. We had the time of our life and will go back again to lovely Marrakesh and of course to see everyone at Dar Anika.,Date of stay: June 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,Hertfordshire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nilouboo

Breakfast is 5 courses and sets you up for day they bring you jugs of cucumber infused water immediately you arrive 'home' their cucumber/mint juice is to die for glasses of milk and dates are left in your room every evening as are fresh towels and robes.

Riad Dar Anika,Lizzy C wrote a review Jun 2015,50,There's nowhere I'd rather stay in Marrakech. Just awesome.,We spent a few days in Marrakech at the beginning of June and had the most amazing time. I honestly don't think I could praise Dar Anika enough.  Everything we could possibly want and more was provided almost instantly.  Upon reaching the riad (we arranged our own transport but Dar Anika can do this for you too) we were met and taken into a beautiful little room. Here we were given water tea and food. One of the owners then came in and spent almost an hour talking to us. He listened to what we wanted to do and then helped us plan an itinerary for our entire stay with helpful tips given along the way.  He helped us make the most of our short trip and his recommendations for where to eat proved absolutely spot on.  The staff at the hotel are just brilliant too- anything you ask for they'll provide it within seconds. They almost seem to intuitively know what you want and have it ready for you!  The breakfast too. Oh. My. God. You are fed like a king/queen. There is course after course and you can watch it be freshly prepared. It is so tasty. We spent about 1.5hours each morning enjoying the sun and the food- it really set us up for the days. Even on the morning we were leaving (too early for breakfast) they provided us with a packed breakfast so we didn't go hungry.  My favourite thing about Dar Anika is that they genuinely go out of their way to get to know you. I'd spoken to them extensively in planning our trip about wanting it to be special and asking for assistance with picking a suitable room (a present from myself to my little sister for her 21st birthday). I hadn't thought anything else of it when we checked in but on our second breakfast all the staff came up to our table and provided my sister with a HUGE bunch of flowers and a birthday cake. They sang Happy Birthday too. It was such a lovely unexpected touch. Needless to say she was the happiest girl around that day!    We visited one of the main hotels whilst we were there for a spa treatment. I could honestly say that it wasn't anywhere close to the standard that Dar Anika provides and I wouldn't hesitate to go back there over and over again.,Date of stay: June 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Copenhagen, Denmark",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/256lizzyc

Lovely room tranquil setting great food - the whole experience was faultless.    The riad is in a safe location just 5/10 minute walk from Jemaa el Fna so you get the benefit of a central location yet the tranquility of being away from the main centre (make sure you go there on Saturday or Sunday night).

Upon arrival we were greeted by the entire staff and one of the brothers who own the Riad (a wonderful and elegant man) created a personalized itinerary for our entire stay in Marrakesh based on our interests. He also arranged for any transportation and reservations that were necessary. In effect he acted as a personal concierge for our entire stay. His guidance was invaluable and allowed us to experience Marrakech's culture history and beauty. The two brothers who own Dar Anika are genuine and generous men whose kindness is evident from the staff's dedication to the guests as well as their employers. I have never seen staff so pleasant and genuinely interested in the happiness of their guests. The beauty of this Riad and the incredible service are accompanied by delicious fresh meals. The food at Dar Anika was impeccable and is personally overseen by the brothers with it's ingredients coming from the Riad's own farm located in the countryside.

Riad Dar Anika,chinamic wrote a review May 2015,50,Wonderful Oasis,From the moment I booked our reservation the staff of Dar Anika was nothing less than amazing. A driver picked us up from the train station and escorted us directly to the door of the riad at the edge of the souk. As soon as we arrived we were given tea dates soup roses and cookies while we waited for the owner (Abu) to check in with us. Abu was wonderful. Even though we were only able to stay for one night he made sure to give us realistic and helpful suggestions on what to see how to get there where to eat (and where not to!) and how to bargain. When he found out that it was one of my friend's birthdays not only did he arrange reservations at a fantastic restaurant but he also had his staff bake a delicious cake to surprise us at breakfast the next day. Incredibly thoughtful!    Breakfast in the morning on the rooftop was excellent - a few served courses which included soup fruit yoghurt eggs crepes... It was all delicious. Highly recommend spending time on the rooftop for drinks snacks etc. Great views and great service.    During our whole stay we felt looked after and so comfortable. This was our first time in Marrakech and I would seriously come back just to stay here again though it would be for more like 5 days instead of 1.    Thank you for everything Abu and your staff.

Riad Dar Anika,marissa a wrote a review May 2015,50,"First Class Treatment, Better Than The Ritz",I travel frequently for work which puts me up in 5 star hotels including Ritz Carlton and Trump properties and Riad Dar Anika 'trumps' them all. We only spent one night at Dar Anika and I was cursing our flight back to NYC when we checked out! Abu was absolutely wonderful he should honestly teach courses in hospitality everyone has something to learn from him! Every member of staff made us feel at home. We were served tea cookies and cakes upon arrival our bed was covered in rose petals and everything was perfect down to the last detail. We booked a very last minute hammam treatment (one hour before the hammam closed) and Hamisa the woman who did our treatment was so much fun. She was so warm and happy (despite our lack of French and Arabic skills) scrubbed off all of our dead skin treated us like family and when I shaved my legs the next day it was the softest I've ever been! The staff made an excellent dinner recommendation and were swift to make reservations for dinner and taxis. Breakfast in the morning was out of this world. Fresh squeezed juice fresh and local jams breads soup fruit it was a real treat! When we checked out Abu handed us a canvas satchel with fruit bottled water and delicious vegetarian sandwiches (he remembered my diet!) because he knew we had a tight connection in Casablanca to fly home to JFK and he thinks (quite rightly so) that the cafeteria in the Marrakech airport is poor.

Riad Dar Anika,Jason T wrote a review May 2015,50,Personal Service,I recently spent 3 nights at Dar Anika and the review are all bang on  this place is brilliant  In fact i would say the service received here is better than some 5 * hotels i've stayed at.  From the moment you arrive Abu ( the owner ) asks you what you want to do while you are there and proceeds to tell you all the must see places in Marakesh  this is not a chance for him to sell you trips he is so proud of Marakesh he wants to ensure you don't miss anything during your stay.  Out comes the local map and he advises where to go and how to get there ( you can walk most places if you're feeling fit)  best restaurants to eat in and places to drink . Take his advise and enjoy getting lost as that's part of the fun!    Personal service is an understatement . nothing is a problem and there is always enough willing staff to deal with anything you might want or need.    I recommend the Hammam and the lady who does it is lovely and your skin will feel amazing afterwards.    You can get them to collect and deliver you back to the airport if you ask ( charged at about £10.00 each way ) but it saves the hassle and the driver is also very nice.

We felt it was almost like the staff could read our minds- as soon as we thought of something we would like it arrived. They even upgraded our room without us asking. The riad is in a perfect location for the souks and the palace which was something we were unsure about when booking. The waitering staff were so friendly they even joined my wife in trying to teach me to write my name in Arabic! (روبرت).

Riad Dar Anika,muncer wrote a review May 2015,50,Simply First Class,What can I say that hasn't already been said by so many others. I'm lucky enough to be a gold member of the Ritz hotel group but have never experienced such a high level of service and attention to detail as Dar Anika.    The Abu brothers who own the Riad have combined the uniqueness of a boutique hotel with the high end end service of a 5 star hotel.    Everything you could ever ask for and more comes as standard and almost anything else you could wish for is happily arranged.    My son and I wanted a very tailored one day trip of culture and high adrenaline fun and Abu delivered beyond our expectations.    As an example of the level of service We took a dip in their beautiful courtyard pool. I put my phone on the side and within seconds a stool arrived and my phone was placed safely on the stool. A few seconds later and a glass of champagne and a virgin mojito arrived. These guys are almost telepathic.    Don't waste your time looking any further.

He welcomed us in and for the next half hour we were lavished with delicious pastries tea soup and mint drink. Breakfasts were to die for and every morning Abu met with us to plan our itinerary for the day.  We stayed four days and on the last day he treated us to lunch. On our departure he had a picnic made up for us. All his staff were incredible! We were blown away with the kindness and generosity at this fab Riad .

Riad Dar Anika,IanWild92 wrote a review May 2015,50,A Gem in the Centre of Marrakech,Perfect location situated between all of Marrakech's tourist hotspots. Despite this it is secluded and self-contained with a very relaxing vibe despite the surroundings. Incredibly attentive staff; this is the best service I have experienced at a hotel by all staff members I interacted with. Every traveller's preferences are different however the staff are genuinely passionate about making your stay as enjoyable as possible and will do whatever they can to accommodate your requests. We came here without knowing anything about Marrakech but we were given in depth friendly advice by hotel staff which really helps in Marrakech as it is easy to get lost in the hustle and bustle. The food was fantastic; beautiful breakfast lovely tagines and fantastic desserts available whenever. You will never go hungry here. The hotel is beautiful the rooms all individual with a distinct Moroccan charm. Charming roof terrace where you can eat meals overlooking the city and also sunbathe if you so wish.

Riad Dar Anika,KLmum wrote a review May 2015,50,Delightful,Tucked away at the edge of the Medina Dar anika riad is a wonderful gem owned by two brothers Abu and Abu. When we arrived at 8pm we were taken into the lounge area brought dates milk cakes and mint tea – and that was before we were served dinner by candle-light on the roof terrace! If there is one thing Dar anika knows how to do well it’s serve amazing Moroccan delights in those wonderful tagine dishes! And so many of them!  We were two women on our own and Abu was marvellous booking us guides and showing us where and where not to go on the map. The riad is beautiful and the service faultless. The waiters and management just couldn’t do enough for us. We were brought drinks whenever we were out on the roof terrace including a fabulous banana and lemon smoothie and cakes in the afternoon.  We were in room 4 on the first floor overlooking the court yard. The Moroccan beds are quite firm but Abu put memory foam and extra padding on mine for my arthritic bones. We had a lovely bathroom with local toiletries fresh towels bathrobe and slippers. We also tried the hamman and had a massage – both of which I would recommend. There is a mosque close by but we closed our window and put on the air conditioning and couldn’t hear a thing.  Breakfast again such a wealth of food for those who want it can be served up on the roof terrace or inside. We liked the highest point that looked out over the busy square. We also loved the tortoises that roamed freely every so often nibbling our toes! Delightful.  The riad is not large and has a cosy feel to it. The roof terrace is where most people eat and socialise. You can sunbathe at the back of the terrace on sun beds without feeling self-conscious and there’s a small indoor pool on the ground floor which we didn’t use although I could imagine that once the temperature rose you might well be tempted. I would say this is a place for couples – although it might be ok if you only had one child. It really was a perfect little paradise in Marrakesh.,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Surrey UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KLmum

Riad Dar Anika,TarynMichal wrote a review May 2015,50,Paradise awaits!!!,Dar Anika    I don't know where to begin but I'll start with this riad exceeded any expectations my friend and I had and it all started with the moment we booked. We requested to have the airport shuttle and our driver Idriss was there waiting for us even though we arrived an hour early. Idris was AMAZING and gave us an explanation of the places we passed and always had a smile on his face. When we arrived we felt like we were right in the middle of the medina. Unlike big hotels the dar Anika was right in the middle of all the action and what I think every person wants when the visit morocco. When you arrive theres a black door that's hidden away. It was like walking into a secret place Inside. Zineb our main receptionist was a gem! She walked us into the sitting room and my friend and I IMMEDIATELY started taking a hundred pictures because we couldn't believe how beautiful this place is. Then came the food. Omg the food!!!! First they bring out the dates and milk then the pasties then this amazing brightly colored Orange soup then the pastries then the fruit. (I know that's a lot but it's true) we honestly couldn't believe it... And everything was amazing. Abu who was so kind and funny took us to the rooftop terrace with great views of the medina and showed us a map on how to get around. He was patient even though we asked him 10 times over how to get to certain places. He knew ahead of time how long our stay was so he gave us a suggested outline on how to tackle as much as possible in our regrettably short stay. He gave us all the tips on how to navigate the souks and how to get to the restaurants but It gets better... When we couldn't find the first place he actually walked us over to the place. Our first night we requested to have the meet and greet dinner and I can't begin to tell you how amazing this was. First let me say that as soon as we booked this riad they sent us a menu if we requested this dinner. We had the lamb tanjine which was presented in a clay pot and literally fell off the bone... I had no room for it and still finished it! The lamb amongst the other 8 courses they presented were phenomenal. We were actually tired of eating but had to try because it was too delicious not to. The next day we had breakfast there as well and again... More selection fresh perfect and really felt like we had the Moroccan experience. The presentation and service were impeccable! If you are considering the in house hammam which is an authentic Moroccan style bath and scrub... Do it! I could honestly write a book on how amazing this riad is and it still wouldn't do this place any justice. We were treated like royal family. We felt safe welcome and just at home here or should I say paradise. 10 stars across the board and there's no question I'm DEFINITELY staying here on my next stay to Marrakech!!!! Upon departure another Abu sent us off with a small lunch for the drive back to the airport and let's just say I had to almost fight off tears because I didn't want to leave. They truly exceeded my expectations and has set a whole new bar for any future travels!

Nothing is too much effort for the staff here and Abu was very kind and generous he oriented us before we headed out provided maps and local knowledge and if we needed anything he would organise it for us. We got the hotel to pick us up fromt he airport this is a good idea as the hotel would be hard to find on your own! The food here is amazing and it is very well located for exploring the city and souks. The hotel also organises excursions out of the city although we didnt take advantage of these this time fellow tourists raved about them. We will definteley do this when we return!

Riad Dar Anika,Nicola J wrote a review May 2015,50,How holidays should be...simply perfect!,My partner and I (both 26 years old) have just returned from a wonderful 4 night stay at the Riad Dar Anika. We are both VEGAN and Abu made sure he did everything possible to provide for us; even requesting a vegan cake recipe so his kitchen could rustle us up some cakes and sure enough a few hours later- we ate cake!  The location is perfect you get to experience the hustle and bustle of the markets and daily life of the locals yet the hotel itself provides you with a tranquil paradise to rest and recuperate. The cleanliness of the Dar Anika was amazing it was immaculate but without that horrible chemical/bleach concoction you often get with hotels. It was luxurious spa-like and a real pleasure to experience. The intimacy of this 'boutique' style hotel gives you a great relationship with the staff who are always there smiling and offering to help. Food 10/10 service 10/10. staff 10/10 rooms 10/10 harman spa 10/10 location 10/10... you get the idea! Thank- you to Abu & Abu and the rest of the staff.

The service is amazing.....have you ever experienced living with 5 butlers and countless maids....now is your chance. I would recomend 4-5 nights here but please take an excursion organized by the hotel is well worth the experience and you get out of the town for a while and see some of Morocco. We went on an excursion up the Ourika Valley where you can get into the heart of the amazing high Atlas mountains....a day trip with no problems. They have other excursions you might want to try or I am sure they would lay on anything you want.(ask about a desert trip).

We arrive very early in the morning (11am) in order to drop our lugage and to come back later to take our room but Abu welcome us with a glass of milk with dates. He was available and give some very good advice for our trip in Marrakech (and you need some very good tricks!).    The place is amazing the roof top is perfect you can see the atlas mountain every morning eating your breakfeast with all the best speciality of Marrakech concentrate in your table. The night there is a lot of candle everywhere and the place became magical.    All the employee are so nice and helpful. They give us black soap spices argan oil food day and night everytime everywhere! There is especially one very helpful who help us finding a strange fruit pick up by the kids in Marrakech looks like a raspberry but white and in the tree and was very funny and help us to pay only 80 DAM to go to the airport.    We take the hammam it was so nice with very good product. There is a side effect the activity protect you with a bubble all around you for the next hour. You can go in the medina and be like on a cloud or on a magic carpet.    I don't want to spoil everything but every little details make for us the trip Unforgettable and the only problem now is to know that we can't find any better hotel in the future.

From the traditional Arab welcome complete with red rose on arrival to the very thoughtful picnic for the journey home Abu & Abu and their excellent staff deliver a 5star + service all the time.Our suite decorated with rose petals was stunning and the family atmosphere of the Riad Dar Anika was just so special.  Abu in his thoughtful way arranged some fantastic excursions for us as a couple but one was so memorable it deserves special mention.We were very fortunate to be the first guests to experience their Stargazers picnic. It starts with an evening drive into the lower Atlas mountains( the last 5km up a Berber trail) and as the sun sets you arrive at a small Berber tent set up on a hillside and meet the owner Abdul dressed in traditional robes.He welcomes you with tea he has just made as your driver /guide sets up the picnic complete with wine. We then spent a magical two hours enjoying our picnic and gazing at the myriads of stars in the Moroccan Sky with just the croaking of frogs in the nearby wadi as an accompaniment. It was such a moving personal experience that my wife and I will never forget it.We have in the past enjoyed the world famous Sounds Of Silence dinner at Uluru in Australia but this was so much more personal Well done Abu and Jaoud our driver for making this night such a highlight of our memorable stay at the Dar Anika . Another couple went after us and were equally spell bound so if you can don't miss this unique trip.

I can highly recommend this beautiful hotel. It' the perfect starting point for exploring Marrakesh since it's really close to the main square of the old town and right across of some major sightseeing points. Nevertheless once you enter the Riad you leave all the craziness that is going on outside behind and find a beautiful quiet hidden gem. The staff is amazing and takes care of you the minute you enter the Riad whether they're providing you with delicious moroccan mint tea and pastries or running errands for you. The owner took good care of us with planning our whole stay giving us excellent dinner recommendations and making sure we got everything we need from medication to post stamps.

We stayed at this place for 4 nights and enjoyed every single second of our trip.  From the moment we were picked up by hotel driver till we left the city we were pampered by all the hotel staff.    This hotel is within the old city center and close to all the bustle and hustle of Marrakesh. A great quiet place to escape after a day in hectic old city center.  Rooms are pretty spacious and shower/bathroom was more than acceptable.    Breakfast is just great but just like with anything in this town: do not rush but take your time and enjoy the roof terrace.  Although not cheap I really would recommend to have diner one evening in the hotel. We suggested we would like to try the camel and strawberries for dessert but for the rest left it up to chef's imagination. It was a great meal which we enjoyed under the stars of a warm evening.    Second recommendation would be to try the ham-man. It is a great way to relax after a full day of walking the Soux.    It was an impressive stay and recommend anybody visiting Marrakesh to consider Dar Anika both for service rooms and location.

I got a taste of what it feels like to be royalty the way the staff treat you. I went here for a big birthday trip not knowing what to expect. From the minute we walked in we were sat down and given treats (within ten minutes we had been presented with flowers local delicacies drinks tea and a lovely welcome in the stunning lounge area). The hotel is located among the madness of Marrakech and inside the decor is quiet peaceful and stunning. It has a pool downstairs a hammam room gorgeous bedrooms (decorated painstakingly with rose petals) a stunning roof terrace tea areas living room with roaring fire....the list goes on. The owner talked us through the highlights of the city and gave us great advice. Afternoon tea and cakes is on the house but the highlight for me was the breakfast. It was literally about 6 courses of the most delicious food I've had in a long time and they will even make you anything you want on top of that. There's no start or finish time so no clock watching and perfect for brunch. There are beautiful plants tortoises wandering round and an area with sunbeds and hats. The bedrooms are comfortable and whilst here we had a hammam by a lovely lady.

Riad Dar Anika,Sammy350 wrote a review Mar 2015,50,40th Birthday trip.,"Without exaggeration if I could give The Dar Anika 10 stars I would. From the minute the large wooden door with a matching brass knocker is opened for you and immediately you are greeted by the smiling courteous and friendly staff immaculately dressed you know this is going to be something special. My wife was handed a single rose the fragrant smell of a mixture of familiar spicy and floral scents hits you. We were shown into the lounge area with an eclectic mix of seatingtables lamps all in the classical Moroccan theme not to mention a log fire burning in the library area. Soon two of the staff arrived and proceeded to bring a plethora of tasty treats. To mention a few- milk and dates soup pastries and a tasty cocktail. All this is unexpected. This was to be a common theme for our stay. The charming girl from reception asked if it was ok for the owner- Abu- to come and introduce himself. Abu then proceeded to spend about 45 minutes with us whereupon he suggested a ""highlights"" tour of Marrakech in the 4 days we where there. Abu was incredibly engaging with perfect English. It felt like he hadn't had this chat with any other tourist before. Abu took us to our room and again without any rush showed us the layout and features of the room. The room is compact (14m2) but well apportioned with plenty of wardrobe space. The 4 poster beautifully hand carved Cedar bed was stunning and Abu seemed very proud of it and asked us to smell it! The whole room and bathroom was beautifully decorated in fresh rose petals all laid out in patterns. The bed was very comfortable. The air conditioning was necessary. The safe was good. Next morning we had breakfast on the roof terrace. Again this stunning area is swamped in flowers and plants. The white linen tables and chairs reflect the incredible service from all staff. Now Abu did say ""take an hour or so over breakfast""  and he was right. A real highlight of the trip. Again the food just kept coming- homemade yoghurt with fruit salad soup (yes soup) pancakes with 5 preserves homemade bread and cake and eggs of your choosing. Unusual by British standards but really delicious nonetheless ( when in Morocco!). Looking down from the terrace the streets are filled with thousands of people and vehicles and carts and horses and motorcycles. It's hard to take in the sheer madness of the non policedanything goes streets. It's really very disconcerting at first but like the souks and the consistent pestering from street vendors you sort of get used to it. It's just part of the experience. I'm not going to ramble on about what to do in Marrakech. It's more fun to find out yourself (helped by Abu)  This review is for Dar Anika . Two more things I would like to single out. After breakfast on our first morning the entire staff came up to the Terrace to sing happy birthday to my wife (in 3 languages) and present her with a stunning birthday cake and a beautiful basket of flowers. I did not ask for this. It was a truly lovely generous gesture and very touching.  Secondly just as we where about to leave for the airport. Abu came over and presented us with a handmade shoulder bag ( made by the on street upholsterers next to the front door). It was filled with sandwiches fruit and bottles of water for our journey home. Again totally unexpected. I have stayed in a few 5 star hotels but never 10 star. It really is that good. Thank you Abu and staff for making my wife's 40th birthday treat unforgettable.",Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sammy350
Riad Dar Anika,lynandmargery wrote a review Mar 2015,50,perfection with a smile,We rarely write reviews but Dar Anika was so fantastic we had to make an exception. From the moment we arrived to be greated to a wonderful light meal with a roarring fire ( a rainy day) to when we left after sunning ourselves under a Berber tent on the roof patio with its wonderful views  the hotel and its staff had been exceptional. Its position close to palais le bahia and palais el badil with an indiot-proof straIght 10 minute walk to Jermaa El Fina is ideal. Abu spends so much time to work out with you an ideal itinerary for your stay and the staff could not be more attentive if you were royalty. The breakfasts and evening meals should not be missed and there is freshly pressed orange juice mint tea coffee and excellent cakes always available.  The rooms and the facilities - hamman indoor pool roof garden and patio  etc - are fine but it is the service of the staff which makes this place so extraordinary. I did not believe the other reviews about Dar Anika until we got there but it is as good as they all say.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New Forest National Park Hampshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lynandmargery

We were greeted with rose petals on our beds and a beautiful set menu that was worth every penny. I even tried camel which is a must whilst here. The staff were very attentive and the owner was very helpful and even giving us a briefing so we knew all the local knowledge. Breakfast was amazing and came in lots of different courses which suited our lazy morning breakfasts. Staff were always on hand when we needed them and provided us with regular cups of mint tea and nibbles. The location was amzaing and we were always only 2 minutes from local tourist attractions and shops to buy goodies from. As a group of girls we felt super safe here.

Mr Abu gave us (a group of 9 women) great suggestions on places to eat sites to see and safety tips. The food at the Riad was fantastic (I went particularly crazy over the delicious yoghurt and the pancake thingy served at breakfast) and really enjoyed the special dinner we had on the first night (I lost count of how many courses there were).    A well run family business with lots of little luxuries and surprises (ask to meet the pet tortoises). The staff were so attentive and kind and I hope they retain this perfect balance.

Riad Dar Anika,Carol B wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Outstanding!,"My husband and I have just returned from a 12 night stay at this lovely boutique hotel. I agree with every positive comment made in other reviews here. Dar Anika really is an outstanding place to stay. After a flight delay we were met at the airport by the hotel's very pleasant driver who took us on the short drive through the hustle and bustle of Marrakech. On arrival in the square outside Dar Anika at about 9pm we were met and escorted into the fragrant candle-lit hotel with soothing music playing in the background. We were greeted by several members of staff and shown to the lovely glass-walled library where rose-water was poured into our hands and warm towels given to dry them. We were then offered a reviving glass of milk with a dish of dates. Our table was already prepared for dinner next to the softly illuminated pool for when we felt ready to eat. The meal consisted of a delicious array of flavours and textures as did all our meals at Dar Anika during our stay and I was in heaven! As another reviewer on here we always stay in 5 star establishments and I have never been made to feel so comfortable and relaxed as I was during our stay at Dar Anika. Every member of staff worked to the highest standards of professionalism whilst also maintaining a warm and welcoming demeanour. The next morning we were met by Abu the owner who spent about an hour finding out about the sort of places that we wanted to visit and giving advice about local customs and places of interest. I was particularly touched that in response to an email that I had sent to the hotel regarding my chemical sensitivities Abu had gone above and beyond anything that I could have hoped for to make sure that my stay at Dar Anika was completely comfortable. Our room suite no. 1 was lovely and nothing was too much trouble during our stay. As Abu said to me ""anything is possible"". Restaurants were booked for us drivers arranged (who escorted us down the sometimes quite long alleyways right into the restaurants and met us in the restaurant when we were ready to leave) excursions were arranged and advice offered. Our enjoyment and safety in an unfamiliar area was given the highest priority by all the staff at Dar Anika during our stay. If anyone would like to read my other Tripadvisor reviews you will see that I 'tell it like it is' and I would not give such a glowing account unless the standards were especially high as they are here.

Riad Dar Anika,piglette777 wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Not sure it gets any better than this...,Wonderful modernised Riad (or Dar) just 10 minutes gentle flat walk to the main square and the souks beyond. Taxi can approach to within 10 metres of the door which is also a plus. Room was superb bathroom fine though a little tight but well lit and a good shower breakfast very good. This has been distinctly modernised as opposed to restored but has lost none of its charm for that. Perfectly quiet hard to imagine when you see the enormous bustle going on just metres from the front door and we slept incredibly well (unusual for us!).    The team were in our view the role model for hotel management from the waiters (Khaled you were magnificent) to the front desk and management. When my phone packed up the manager lent me his laptop to keep in the room for a few days then offered to let us take it to our next hotel (3 hours away) for the rest of the trip - 'just get your driver to bring it back sometime'. Whatever we needed they were there for us - we weren't just told where a pharmacy was we were escorted there and back. Do let this team pamper you the way we were - we cannot thank them enough for making Marrakech so special.    Also if you have the chance stay in one night for dinner. Traditional fare with a twist but it was quite superb - taste presentation variety service and in enormous quantities too.

Riad Dar Anika,Nadine1020 wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Fantastic Experience,My partner and I have only just got back from a five night stay. I rarely write reviews but this hotel was especially worthy of comment. We were treated like royalty. The service and hospitality were fantastic.  We were greeted by the owner Abo at breakfast who helped construct a program for our stay in Marrakesh. All the recommendations he gave were excellent especially the Azzar restaurant and Richard Branson's hotel for a hamman and spa.  We were given a mobile phone to contact the hotel for any queries or for assistance. This was reassuring and useful. If you feel at all nervous about travelling to Morrocco then this is a good place to stay. Consideration is their forte.  The drivers working for the hotel spoke good English were knowledgable about the area and know the quality of the surrounding restaurants.  The hotel itself is beautiful and spotlessly clean. The bedrooms are gorgeous and comfortable. The hotel has a great roof terrace with views over the surrounding rooftops. a Bedouin tent area sun loungers flower pots and two rampant tortoises ha ha A lovely place to retreat to read or enjoy a meal.  The staff could not be faulted. All were polite friendly courteous and keen to please. The head waiter was fantastic. Nothing was too much trouble. He went the extra mile..  My fiftieth birthday was marked by an unexpected bouquet of flowers birthday cake the staff singing 'Happy Birthday' a fantastic set of suggestions for the day and rose petals in the room. What can I say it was 'WOW!'  The food was excellent. I could not fit it all in. The cakes were great.  We were sad to leave. What more can be said.

Riad Dar Anika,Michael-Aileen wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Mother and daughter mini-break,"We arrived in Marrakech in the early evening with the square outside the hotel still bustling with activity and shown to a very inauspicious looking door. My immediate thought was ""This can't be it!"" However what a wonderful surprise awaited us when we walked inside - an oasis of peace and calm and understated elegance. From the moment we arrived we received a truly exceptional level of care and attention. My daughter has a number of food intolerances and the staff had researched various ingredients and amended their soup recipe to ensure that she enjoyed her food to the full. Khalid who has been referred to in previous reviews deserves a special mention; he remembers all your likes and dislikes and brought my daughter various alternatives for breakfast each morning so that she had plenty to eat. When I asked him which was his day off he said that it was the following day but that he felt he should really be at the hotel to welcome the new guests. A real gentleman from start to finish. I can't speak highly enough of the owner and the whole staff. They made dinner reservations called taxis gave advice about where to go and what to do; nothing was too much trouble. Any queries or problems were sorted out to my complete satisfaction. Apart from the wonderful breakfasts and evening meal which was one of the best we had during our stay the location is perfect. It's walking distance to most things and you can get a taxi almost outside the door.

This place is just amazing. From the moment we arrived we were treated magnificently and I have never stayed in a place with such kind and helpful staff.  The owner is clearly passionate about his business country and food. He's built a great team around him who share his commitment to service. I can and will recommend this Riad to my friends and family. I also plan on returning next year.  I can recommend the car service they provide for the airport pickup it costs a bit more than the local taxi's but you get a better car and won't have a taxi driver tying to rip you off at the destination.  I can also recommend the hotels dinner which we had on the Friday night we arrived it was one of the best meals we had in Marrakech.  Finally my wife and I tried the Riad's Hamman which is smaller than those you get in Turkey but the lady who did it was lovely and used local spices which she mixed up in front of us.

Riad Dar Anika,kmc266 wrote a review Mar 2015,50,A hidden gem inside the bustling Marrakesh Medina,This was one of the most AMAZING places I have ever stayed at -- truly paradise. A friend and I decided to travel to Morocco and we were so happy that this Riad had availability. They offer the highest level of service I have ever seen -- this was more personal than the service I have received at both the Ritz Carlton and Four Seasons. They truly make you feel like family during your stay and don't just tell you that they care about how much you enjoy Morocco; they actually show you. We were two girls traveling together and different staff took the time to sit with us and make sure we knew how to stay safe walking around in the Medina. One day we were going out to the Ourika Valley and the doorman (even though he didn't know how to tell us in English) stopped us and found someone else to remind us to wear warm clothing so we wouldn't get sick! They gave us amazing advice for bargaining and shopping in the souks. Aside from this the food was impeccable. I highly suggest you enjoy dinner at the Riad. The included breakfast soup and cakes (wonderful afternoon snacks) were divine. The riad itself was beautiful but the people were even more genuine and caring. We will definitely be back soon and highly recommend this riad to all of our friends and family.,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"San Francisco, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kmc266
Riad Dar Anika,LeanneM16 wrote a review Feb 2015,50,AMAZING experience at Riad Dar Anika,"From the moment the door of Riad Dar Anika opened we were transformed and embraced into the Marrakech hospitality. The entire staff are so genuine and welcoming it's hard to describe without sounding like a 'paid reviewer'. We are a family of extensive world travellers and have enjoyed many many 5 star hotels. You get 5 star service at those hotels but let me tell you: you have never experienced the graciousness & service of Dar Anika. Authentic. Outstanding. Nothing asked was too much. Abu & his staff organized everything for us. Personal guided tour of the Medina and Souk. Camel rides. Guided driven tour. Dinners at Dar Anika were beyond outstanding. Abu even organized dancers and musicians from the Atlas mountains to entertain all the guests one night. My 11 year old stated ""Mom I can't go back"". The food was THAT good. If you can impress us with our travel experience a vegetarian and two children - aged 11 & 13 - all of whom had such an amazing experience - we felt we were treated as family (and felt special!). I spoke with the other guests and we all felt the same. I made my decision to book here largely on other fellow TripAdvisor reviewers and I actually thought 'it can't be THAT great'....but it was! (read the other reviews - they were right..) I can tell you this: if you want one of the best experiences you can imagine - book Dar Anika and let Abu and his staff coordinate it all for you. Hammam dinner breakfast tours they did it all and it was an absolute authentic experience and very affordable. Oh did I mention you step outside the Riad and you are right in the centre of the action - within minutes to all the places you want to see. I called my 75 year mother in Canada and told her that her next trip will be to Dar Anika. We will be back. Do yourself a great favor and go here. There are only 12 rooms which makes it feel like you really are 'at home'. We will definitely definitely go back and recommend Dar Anika to everyone without hesitation.

Riad Dar Anika,Gillian W wrote a review Feb 2015,50,The tops!,We so enjoyed our four nights at Riad Dar Anika that we dropped by briefly to say farewell on our way from Essaouira to the airport three days later. The whole staff led by Samir are very friendly and welcoming. This was a quiet understated civility and they couldn't have been more thoughtful or helpful. Samir's suggestions on what to see in Marrakesh were very useful and his map was invaluable. His recommendations for where to eat proved wholly reliable and the establishments clean and pleasant. Our bedroom (number 3) had all we could want right down to cotton buds and it was mercifully quiet. We were delighted with the scores of crimson rose petals scattered all over the bed and even the bath when we first saw the room. That said it all - a charming introduction to the colourful city. The roof garden was worth seeing despite February weather. A very kind touch was the provision of a picnic lunch when we were leaving; we were relieved not to have to test the cooking at the highway busstop. Best of all the attentiveness and care of the waiters especially the head waiter Khalid was highly professional and perfectly executed and made us feel very pampered! The location of this Riad is just right in the Medina at the mouth of a minor souk with all the local activity at the doorstep. However it is very near a big road accessible by taxi and only a few hundred metres from the Jemaa el Fna. Most of the places we wanted to see were within walking distance. We were recommending this Riad to strangers before we had even left the country; we are convinced it couldn't be bettered.,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Portlaoise, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/761gillianw
Riad Dar Anika,Chelleb929 wrote a review Feb 2015,50,Looking forward to visiting this place again,Two friends and I arranged a girls weekend in Marrakech at Dar Anika for mid January. Everything about the weekend was just what I needed to forget my post Christmas holiday blues. From the minute we stepped out of the baggage area at the airport our driver was waiting for us to take us directly to the Riad.  The Riad has an excellent location - situated close to the medina with the square only a 10 minute walk away however secluded and private enough so you felt as if you were in your own secret garden. Once you walk into the Riad you will understand exactly what I mean as it feel likes you've left the city behind and entered a relaxing indoor oasis complete with an indoor swimming pool. But the real treat for me was the comfortable lounge area and fireplace - it quickly became my favourite place to hangout.  The owner Abu greeted us upon arrival and arranged a lovely welcome lunch on the roof top. After relaxing for a bit we each had spa treatments. I recommend getting the hammam followed by a full body massage a perfect combination. Total treatment lasts about 3 hours and is worth it.  We finished our first day with dinner in the Riad - fish for me as I don't eat red meat while my friends sampled the lamb and camel tangines. Dinner was delicious and bountiful so prepare for healthy portions of delicious side dishes.  Breakfast the next day was amazing - pancakes fresh bread eggs made to order freshly squeezed orange juice fruit yogurt and more. A great start to the day.  Abu helped us to plan our weekend which was a mixture of shopping at the souks dinner at recommended restaurants nightlife at popular clubs in the area and a private outdoor cooking class near Atlas mountain where we prepared our own tangines. He even arranged our transportation during the day and evening as needed so we had a driver we could contact when we needed to get back to the Riad.  We ended our long weekend with a second spa treatment before heading to the airport.

Riad Dar Anika,LydiaDreams wrote a review Feb 2015,50,Girls getaway,This was my first visit to Marrakech and the second for my travelling companions. We had chosen the Riad Dar Anika as my friends had met the owner on their last visit and he invited them back to say at his hotel on their next visit as their last hotel experience had not lived up to their expectations.  Upon arrival we were greeted by the hotel concierge and escorted to the roof top for a welcome meal. The view at the top of the hotel was beautiful. I could see the Souk and the hustle of the busy road under. Each of us was presented with a red rose during our welcome meal and the owner came up later to welcome us to his hotel. After we were taken to our rooms were the theme of red roses carried on. Petals were carefully placed on our beds and in the bathroom. I couldn't help but think this would be perfect for a romantic getaway.  We stayed at the Riad Dar Anika for 3 nights.  If staying you must experience the full body scrub and massage. Two and a half hours of sheer pleasure and relaxation. Bring your swimming costume or go in naked as I did.  This was my first time eating authentic Moroccan food and I was not disappointed. Make sure you are starving hungry because there are many many delectable dishes to try. I had the Camel...the meat just fell off the bone. My friend is vegetarian and she found lots on the menu to satisfy her appetite.  The staff are friendly and cannot do enough for you. I felt like a princess.  If you are lost as to where to visit the hotel staff will help you. There is a huge arrange of places to visit and some amazing night clubs and restaurants. The hotel will arrange taxis to take you to each place if you wish.  Riad Dar Anika is beautiful. My favourite place to sit and relax was the living room with fireplace. Relaxing chairs and a variety of games to play if you don't feel like going anywhere.  When I come back to Marrakech with that someone special I will definitely stay at the Riad Dar Anika. The hotel is great for friends and families but I can imagine it would be magical for couples.,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Reading, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LydiaDreams

The structure has amazing attention to detail with an intentional architecture that pays tribute to the nearby 19th century Bahia Palace. Its like a Moroccan Architectural Digest showpiece. The glass-enclosed library is museum-like and features a lovely marble fireplace (we were there in winter) and interesting antiques. There is a lovely rooftop terrace to view the bustle and have a drink. Speaking of which Dar Anika stocks some fantastic Moroccan wines. We know wine and several of the Moroccan wines are absolutely quality. Dar Anika is owned by two lovely brothers (which we found personally important to stay in locally owned Riads) whom are very interesting and aspiring sommeliers. Lastly the location of Dar Anika is perfect in that its not in the heart of the crazy medina but rather centrally located on the south side so there is much to see within a 20 minute walk in all directions. From the food to the hammam Dar Anika is a great place to stay.,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bandon, Oregon",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/760tomv
Riad Dar Anika,NishaCh wrote a review Feb 2015,50,perfect for a special occasion!,We stayed in October 2014 for 4 nights & this review is long overdue! Where can I start.. amazing in every way. I booked this as a birthday surprise for my husband and it was just perfect. A beautifully clean oasis just minutes from the souks. Marrakech is magical and so was Dar Anika. The room downstairs wasn't to our liking on the first night and they changed our room immediately the next day. We were made to feel like royalty. The amazing ice cream cake staff singing happy birthday and champagne bottle provided by Dar Anika was beyond my expectations my husband and I were blown away by the hospitality we received. In addition the daily mint tea water and cakes were a real treat and much needed after long days in the Marrakech heat.  I'd like to thank Samir and all the staff for a very memorable and special stay and for making my husband's birthday just perfect. We'd also like to wish Samir all the luck for his forthcoming wedding. We hope to see some photos! :-),Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hertfordshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NishaCh

We were very happy with their service.    Room was nice and clean. Every time we were out and in. Room was always cleaned and organized. They also left some snack for us in the room.    Up on arrival they offered nice moroccan tea and snacks. As we arrived mid day before check in time they let us stay in the lounge area with their nice refreshment service. Also gave us very informative briefing about the city and where to visit.    We also reserved hammam and massage service. I only got hammam experience which was very relaxing. I liked their natural product they used on my body. It was absolutely relaxing and soothing for my skin. My friends got massage service. They also seem to very happy about the massage service. We were very satisfied.    We had ordered dinner one night which was also very great. They offered the belly dancing show prior to dinner which it was very entertaining. Dinner quality was absolutely perfect. Food was very authentic moroccan.    I cannot say anything more than just ""perfect"".

Riad Dar Anika,Saraa006 wrote a review Jan 2015,50,"Top Class Hospitality.. It just get's better, better & better with each stay",Just got back from a stay at Dar Anika.. Fabulous. Our 2nd visit & just loved it we were treated like princesses. I love this place as its so versatile long weekend away with the girls or romantic get away with partner it hits the bill. The service is brilliant & reinforced with the no tipping staff culture of the Riad all guests have the same superior service as standard. Fresh roses in the rooms no end to refreshments home made cakes & fruit. We were well fed. On this visit we contemplated booking in with a well known spa in the top 3 for marrakech however we tried the hammam & massage package at Dar Anika & it was brilliant. We loved the fact after the hammam we chilled out near the fire was prepared a organic healthy lunch on the spur played solitaire before our massage. This was priceless time was not an issue & booked in again on the day of our departure. On our last visit Abu had put togeather an excellent itinery so we had exhausted most of the best places to see eat club & drink in Marrakech. However he pulled it out again on this visit from organising dinner at Palais Namasker to private cooking lessons with a prestigious chef on his farm. Abu will suggest activities to your taste activity level & budget. Nothing was any trouble you just have to ask & it's done with a smile. The staff are so lovely attentive & patient. Dar Anika have thier own drivers you book out & most reccommended for evenings out rather then taxis. We had the same driver each night & on one of the nights we clubbed & bar hopped our driver was excellent & patient & all this for surprisingly great value for money. On our arrival night we had dinner at the Riad fabulous again we each had a main of the menu inc the Camel & were not dissappointed 5* organic food from their farm with excellent service. Overall for the high level of service quality of food drinks & beautiful surroundings its sure  value for money & worth it. This is probably the only place we will book on any return visits as with all the extras you get when  you stay here they are priceless & would now be dissapointed with anything less.,Date of stay: January 2015,,Bath,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saraa006
Riad Dar Anika,Neil B wrote a review Jan 2015,50,Short stay,We stayed for three nights. The Hotel was lovely and all the staff were charming and friendly and put themselves out to look after us and make our stay special. We felt like members of a large and very happy family. We could not believe how the room was decorated with Rose petals and Roses; such a lovely touch. The hotel was light quiet and everything you could hope for. There was always a log fire burning so it was never cold and in the evening candles and soft lighting created a sense of well being. Despite our poor French the staff and management spoke good English and put us at our ease.The food was excellent plentiful beautifully cooked and presented exquisetly. The manager helped us to plan our stay which made a massive difference to us for which we are very grateful. The Hammam and massage were wonderful experiences and not to be missed.  We were very touched by the surprise birthday cake beautiful bouquet of Roses and the lovely celebration songs which we thoroughly enjoyed.  As a final impression the Iniana Jones bag of food for the plane was a very thoughtful touch.  We would recommend this hotel without hesitation and we would like to extend our thanks to everyone in Dar Anika who made our stay so very special.,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Street, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/564neilb

Riad Dar Anika,beachloverPrinceton wrote a review Jan 2015,40,Boutique chic,"First i need to clarify that we did not stay overnight at the hotel but only spend the New Year dinner and celebrations and with this occasion we saw the hotel rooms service.  Location- excellent. On the ""quieter"" side in between the souks and the up and coming jewish quarter close to batha palace on a very nice street  Service- excellent beginning to end. The New Year party was small and intimate 10 guests at best but the staff made such an effort to create a party atmosphere with music dance and a little show (loved the ""candle woman""). We felt like we were in someone's home it was very genuine. Even the cooks and cleaning staff joined at midnight! Very special.  Dinner- food was good but plain- would have preferred something more festive than tangine for 150 eur/person; i guess we had too much tangine over the 7 days in morocco for 30- 40 dirham not to feel a little cheated. I would encourage some creativity for special occasions.  Hotel: lobby library lounge rooftop terrace- all outstandingly decorated a blend of traditional and stylish moroccan with some amazing antique pieces.  Room- we needed to use the restroom during dinner and oddly enough we used a guest room (guests were away). To start with I wouldn't have liked for anyone to enter my room and use my toilet while i was not there; ok. I understand they must have had some malfunctioning and the staff were trying to be accomodating...still it was a used guest room. That aside it was a small guest room rather plain vanilla; the room at our own Riad (Itrane) which was about 30% cheaper (Anika was full at the time of the reservation) was about twice as big and definitely more luxurious (e.g we had private rooftop access larger bath little livingroom) so we felt that ""accidentally "" we scored a much better deal.  Regardless of the few hiccups- Dar Anika is a very special place especially because of the people- truly great.",Date of stay: December 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"princeton, nj",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beachloverPrinceton
Riad Dar Anika,AleksanderOl wrote a review Jan 2015,50,Dream Come True in this 6 Star Riad,I don't normally write reviews although I have probably stayed in several dozen hotels reviewed by others on this site.    So why was I tempted to write this?    So that you know that Dar Anika is a pearl of absolute beauty and hospitality in the heart of Marrakesh.    The Riad is beautiful. It's authentic. The meal we ate there during the very first evening (highly recommended) was a multi course feast for the senses and the best food we had during our stay in Morocco. The in hotel massage is professional and relaxing to the point you may fall asleep during it (which I did).    All that is great and in itself would justify a five star review but the real distinctness of this hotel lies something else - in it's staff and for that I would award a sixth star if it was only possible.    Samir Fatwa and the Team are there to cater to your every wish spoken or otherwise. Celebrating our anniversary I enquired about the cost of one of their magnificent suites which was vacant at that time. The second day Samir offered a free upgrade free of charge for three nights just because he knew we were celebrating a special occasion we liked it and he wanted to treat us - show me another hotel were this happens.    But that's just one example. On a regular basis the staff go out of their way to make you feel blissful. Whether it's small complimentary evening treats mint tee and cake throughout the day reservations at restaurants guided tours or booking transfer they aim to please and do it well.    During our second night the Staff surprised us with a special anniversary cake and a bottle of champagne!    On the last day Samir even equipped us with lunch for our trip back and gave us small gifts.    We already miss this wonderful hotel and the people who work there and hope as many people will be able to have this fantastic experience.    Trust this review and have a wonderful stay at Dar Anika.    Alex & Alex,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AleksanderOl
Riad Dar Anika,buv1955 wrote a review Jan 2015,50,Faultless,Let me start with the negatives.........  Now that done let me enlighten you on what I consider to be one of the nicest places I've ever stayed at.  We arranged for their driver to collect us and although we could have took a taxi at a much cheaper rate the luxury of having someone greet us and take the care to look after our needs was well worth it. He drove through what I can only describe as the equivalent of Piccadilly circus with the lights out. Drivers going in all directions kamikaze motorcyclists popping up from nowhere pedestrians crossing all over the place but he got us there in one piece.  We arrived in the hustle and bustle of the square with its noise dust beggars and all when the driver knocked at the door of the Riad. When the door opened we were presented with a tranquil peaceful oasis. Very well appointed and welcoming. A small pool a loung with roaring fire relaxing seating areas. We were welcomed by very friendly staff who served us with tea dates and other delicacies. We were then shown to our room which had all the necessary amenities. But it was decked in rose petals and the effect was just amazing.  We ate our first meal at the Riad and what a treat that was. The food never stopped coming and by the time the main course came along i just couldn't eat it. Delicious.  The breakfasts were truly amazing and served with such grace and politeness.  Samir the manager sat down with us on the first morning and gave us a run down on the dos and don'ts of the city. Very valuable advice. He pointed out where to go and what to avoid. Never did he try and sell us anything.  I had a massage at the hotel and thoroughly recommend this.  There is free wifi in the Riad  There is a rooftop terrace where there are sun loungers and dining tables and relaxing chairs. A real oasis.  The hotel is situated in a perfect location with all the tourist attractions within a 5/10 min walk.  We were there in winter time and the hotel provided without request hot water bottles and electric radiator which came in very handy.  On leaving we were offered free use of their driver to go to the airport and a packed lunch free of charge. Such a nice touch.  I highly recommend this hotel,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,manchester england,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buv1955

The added value gained through professional advice from Samir and his team in both recommending and organising day and evening trips enhanced our four day vacation in Marrakech.  Cleanliness comfort security and an excellent location allowed us to maximise our activities from this location in Madina.  All requests for information or assistance to Hallid and the staff were efficiently met promptly.  Breakfast quality quantity and speciality deserves specific mention together with the opportunity to be served indoors or on a split level terrace area to enjoy the morning sun.A full range Moroccan dinner menu is available which will satisfy all visitors.  The owners of the Dar Anika are often involved gaining feedback from customers and also welcoming guests into a great holiday environment.

Riad Dar Anika,Marionhas4 wrote a review Jan 2015,50,Very Unusual Holiday Accommodation,Dar Anika is a beautiful Riad which is perfectly situated within the Medina for access to many places of interest being only a few minutes walk from the main square and the souks. The food is amazing breakfasts are a feast brought to your table with an array of freshly baked breads fresh orange juice and jams. There are many other items also just too many to mention. We had booked dinner here on our first evening. It was authentic Moroccan cuisine fresh vegetables succulent meat and many courses having the delicate taste of the beautiful spices. There is the option to have meals on the leafy rooftop terrace and enjoy the sunshine.    On arrival we were shown to the library which is a lovely room with a wall of glass overlooking a dining area and the indoor pool. Here we were served small glasses of chilled milk dates small pastries and delicious hot mint tea. I'm not normally a fan of a herb type tea but this Moroccan speciality is delicious. This was a complimentary welcome and an introduction to a wonderful stay in Dar Anika.    Our bedroom was beautiful spotlessly clean white bedlinen covered in rose petals a tray of fresh fruit and authentically Moroccan in character with its beautiful lamps and lighting.    Now for the reason for my heading. My husband and I are fairly extensively travelled world-wide and never have we been looked after with such genuine care and attention. Every member of staff gives personal prompt attention to requirements. Nothing is too much trouble and we were constantly reminded to ask for anything which would make our holiday more pleasurable. The reason for this is because the owners and senior management take a personal interest of care in their guests. I've got to mention Khalid the head waiter and a very gracious man whose main interest was to please and assist in any way possible.    Samir the manager spent private time with us arranging the itinerary for our whole stay. He gave us a map and suggested places we should visit and this he did. Some places were within walking distance and these were marked on our map. Other trips were suggested and he arranged for us to have our own dedicated driver who took us to places of interest during the day and various restaurants in the evening Lebanese Moroccan and French etc. All expenses while we were out meals and entrance fees we paid while we were there and the charges for the driver were added to our bill at the Riad. We had a lovely driver who was happy to wait or return after our expeditions and the cost was not overly expensive and well worth the comfort of knowing we would have a safe and prompt return to Dar Anika.    It was a lovely gesture on our last day to be given a lovely Moroccan bag containing a picnic with sandwiches and fresh fruit for our journey home.    Our stay at Dar Anika was faultless and services were above and beyond anything we have experienced at any other place we have visited.

I booked dinner some time before arrival and I must say it was the best dinner we had sitting on the roof top and hearing the slight buzz from the city. One night we had a local musician playing for the guests dining on top a great experience as well.    We can recommend everything from the massages dinner private on-site Hamam the small pool etc. The best for me were the breakfasts in the warm sun on the roof-top however those I won't forget in a long time.    The location is somewhat better better than other Riads since its not in the middle of the old town but rather just on the side.

Riad Dar Anika,JZ8911 wrote a review Jan 2015,50,Fantastic stay (but beware of pricey car service),We had a wonderful 4-night stay at the Riad Dar Anika in early December. All of the staff are very warm and welcoming from the moment you step inside. We arrived from the airport with the taxi arranged through the hotel and were ushered into this sanctuary from the busy street outside. Before taking us to our rooms we were served cookies and tea in front of a toasty fire just off the main foyer. The room itself was very clean with fresh rose petals everywhere. We were welcomed this way every day when coming back to the riad. When we left they surprised us with packed sandwiches and water for our trip... such a lovely way to end our vacation!    Pros: amazing staff FANTASTIC breakfast with more food/drink than you could possibly eat delicious dinner (much better than the other riads that the hotel offered for us to try! They actually shop for the food only after you've booked that evening's meal so everything is super fresh... and we could never finish all the food!) beautiful rooftop terrace for breakfast/lounging convenient location (5-8 minute walk) to the Jemaa el Fnaa the Koutoubia and the souks    Cons: super expensive car rides... if you're worried about safety the riad's private car service is a great option but it'll cost you >10x the price of a normal taxi. They charge 300 dirhams ($30) for a 10 minute ride to a riad for dinner which would otherwise cost max 20 dirhams ($2). They don't tell you this when they offer to book it for you so it was a bit of a shock to us when we received it on the hotel bill...

Riad Dar Anika,Dinah D wrote a review Dec 2014,50,Wonderful stay in Marrakech,We stayed at the Riad Dar Anika it being the first time we had been away for Christmas.Having been collected from the airport by taxi arranged by the hotel we arrived in a very busy street but were taken to the door of the hotel our luggage having been carried by a member of the hotel staff. The door opened and it was like walking through into an oasis of calm. The inside of the Riad is just stunning with hanging plants and a peaceful inner courtyard. When we arrived we were greeted by Samir the manager and his staff with rose water to wash our face and hands and given mint tea milk and dates. We were then shown our room where rose petals had been arranged on our bed and in the bathroom. Very beautiful. From that moment on the service and attention to our every comfort was first class. We had dinner there the first night as we arrived in the evening. The food was absolutely delicious and very plentiful. We had dinner in the sitting room where our table had been laid. There was an open fire and the whole setting was so beautiful. The following morning after breakfast which consisted of many courses again including cake fruit yogurt eggs pancakes honey jams and freshly squeezed orange juice which we took on the rooftop overlooking the medina Samir met with us and told us the best places to see and eat and also advised on best way to walk through the souk and marking everything on a map for us. We also had a taxi driver to take us one day to see the sights and one evening to take us to dinner in the Nouveau Ville which is the modern part of Marrakech. Would also recommend the massage at the hotel. Very relaxing and wonderful for the skin.We had our Christmas Day dinner in the hotel and again the meal was fantastic with the waiting staff being very attentive and so welcoming. When we left on Boxing Day morning Samir gave us each a bag with a packed lunch for our journey home.We would certainly recommend the Riad Dar Anika and are looking forward to returning there sometime.

Our host Samir and his thoughtful & considerate staff made our stay a pleasure.  Samir was very helpful in offering advice of what to see and recommending places to eat for lunch and evening meal. We particularly enjoyed Café Arab Cozi Bar Café des Epices and Terrace des Epices. He also organised trips for us to the Atlas mountains Essaouira and to a half day cooking course. We used the services of the Riad's driver to get us to and from the evening restaurants saving us the hassle of using local taxis.  The Riad is close to the bustling Medina but very quiet and peaceful once you get behind it's enormous front door and into the very welcoming inner courtyard. Most rooms are on the balcony level and a sneak peak in a few of them revealed them all to equally well appointed.  The excellent breakfast was served on the sunny rooftop terrace.  The Riad has it's own hammam. Definitely an experience one should try at least once. We didn't use the swimming pool but could see how inviting it would look on hot summer days.

Riad Dar Anika,OBKB wrote a review Dec 2014,50,A calm oasis filled with generous people,From the moment we stepped through the carved doors of Dar Anika to the regretful time they last closed on our reluctant backs our stay was wonderful. Our room (a long sought twin) was spacious and very clean with a beautiful bathroom filled with argon oil soap and chocolate scented shampoo. The beds were scattered with rose petals and fruit water and biscuits were laid out lest we ever got hungry. The rest of the riad was very beautiful from the ceder ceilinged sitting room where we sat by the fire to the sun and plant filled terrace where we ate breakfast in the morning. In true Morroccan style it was the food and the people that stood out for us. From Leila's greeting with roses milk dates cake tea and biscuits to Samir's comprehensive guide to attractions and eating from the fresh cake that Halima made each day and that was served to us by silent smiling young men to the packed lunch that she provided us with on our way to the airport from the money changing they helped us with to the argon oil and spices that they gifted us with on our departure.

Riad Dar Anika,kmobsy wrote a review Dec 2014,50,The best birthday present ever!,I visited this Riad with my sisters as part of a 40th birthday treat. What can I say other than from start to finish we were made to feel so welcome and special! The hospitality was exceptional. When we arrived we were greeted with roses rose scented hot towels and of course Morroccan tea milk dates and lots of lovely sweets. When we were taken to our rooms we were amazed at how beautifully authentic they were. I loved the organic products in the bathroom my hair was so silky with the shampoo. In terms of location I would say we were very well placed. Just 10 minutes to the left took us to the Jemaa al Fanaa - the main market square to the right we were able to walk to The Koutoubia mosque and the Palace gardens. If we wanted a taxi the taxi rank was also just a few minutes to the right of the hotel. A tip - just agree the price with the taxi driver beforehand.  The hotel were helpful in suggesting where best to eat so do make sure you take on board what they recommend. They were also able to provide a driver to take us to and from the restaurants (there was a charge for this service however).  I guess the best part was being surprised by a birthday cake and a lovely bouquet of flowers by the hotel staff. I was in tears I just didn't expect it!  There is also a pool at the Riad which my sisters and I used one evening. As it was cold they heated it for us. Do be sure to let the hotel know when you want to use it if going in winter because they will get it to the right temperature for you.  When we left the hotel we were each given a bag with a packed lunch and a free bottle of Argan oil. I think you will agree that it does not get much better than this!    Another quick tip..if you want to go for a hammam the one on site is good but the best one is the Heritage spa. You will need to book this in advance so ask the reception staff to do this for you. In fact if you want to book anything the reception will do this for you.  Also if you take the three village tour wear comfortable climbing shoes - it can get steep and slippery as you get higher up the mountains. The view is definitely worth a trip so don't miss out.  A special mention to Samir and Leila who made each day of our stay informative and wonderfuel. Also to the breakfast staff who made our 7 course breakfasts on the terrace a royal experience.    This riad is a gem. Don't miss out especially if you are celebrating a birthday or anniversary. They will spoil you rotten!,Date of stay: December 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kmobsy

Riad Dar Anika,ImConstructive wrote a review Dec 2014,50,The most amazing place to stay with amazing hospitality,Me and my sisters have just returned from a long weekend at Dar Anika and being a frequent traveler I can easily say this was one of the most hospitable homely and luxurious stays ever. We were celebrating one of my sister's 40th birthday and they had all left their children at home to relax and unwind from life.    The moment we arrived Leila (staff) gave us fresh (literally fresh) goats milk and dates. We were then given rose oil to freshen our faces and a wet towel followed my Moroccan tea and biscuits. THEN we were led to our beautiful rooms which were flourishing with rose petals everywhere. The room decor was beautiful and authentic for a true Moroccan experience.    Our breakfast was one of the biggest highlights and it felt like a 10 course meal oozing with freshness and quality.    Before we got there I informed them that it was my sister's 40th birthday and so they even surprised her (and me) with a cake and bunch of flowers making the trip even more special for her.    Whenever we wanted something a recommendation help snacks etc they would be readily available and never seemed short fused if we ever went overboard. One could easily just relax in this Riad and not feel the need to do anything else but maybe stroll through the market alley to end up into Jamaa el Fanaa within 5-10 mins.    The cutest part was; they prepared lunch bags for us with sandwiches and fruit (and now I'll be recycling the bag as an everyday lunch bag!) on our departure back to London.    It was truly a beautiful experience and I'll definitely be returning here :),Date of stay: December 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ImConstructive

The food in Morocco is really good and the meals we had at the Dar Anika were special. Just really good food and service. So if you could give a score here of six or more we would do it.

Didnt seem phased by the fact we arrived very stressed after driving in Moroccan traffic. They had prepared a special cake for us and a bouquet of roses and lilies on the breakfast table. We were looking for supplies for a trip across the Sahara and Ab the kind proprietor pointed us to everything we needed. The only things we couldn't find were towels and he sold us some of his at a mere $0.10 each; and a coffee plunger so they gave us one of theirs as a present. They even packed us a picnic lunch when we left which many hours later with no restaurants in sight was a godsend. Only recommendation I'd have is if you are driving figure out a way to have someone meet you in Marrakech to show you the way as it was hard to find and difficult to drive right up to.

Riad Dar Anika,Richard K wrote a review Nov 2014,50,Gracious hosts and beautiful Riad!,We stopped here for a couple of nights on our way from Ireland to Mauritania for our desert wedding. It was to be our last chance for a luxurious stop and it did not disappoint! It was difficult to find driving a RHD Landcruiser fully for desert travel in the crowded evening but once we arrived it was like a taste of heaven. Beautiful building with amazing common area we were greeted with roses milk tea and sweets. Ab (spelling?) the manager was so amazing and helpful as were all the staff. We were on a bit of a treasure hunt to collect some necessities before hitting the desert including yoga mats a shovel teapot coffee pot and wedding rings. Ab helped us find everything. We came up short on the coffee pot so he ended up giving us one from the hotel!  We had a full dinner the first night and it was amazing- course after course of delicious food. We were full and exhausted before dessert and asked to retire to our room. This caused some consternation with the staff. It turned out they had prepared a special frozen chocolate mousse cake with wedding congratulations written on it candle and all. Served along with poached pears with cream and chocolate sauce. Truly delicious and unexpected! We also took advantage of a private hammam and massage- our first hammam. It was a wonderful experience having our skin washed scrubbed then covered with a mixture of mysterious substances then washed again.  Having travelled much and staying in many luxury hotels I can honestly say this was probably my best experience ever.

You're well located next to cash points and a short walk from the town centre / souks but not so in the thick of it you can't find a quieter stroll when you need a break!    Nothing is too much trouble. The breakfast is absolutely fantastic and just keeps coming... although nothing can compare to the 5 course traditional Moroccan mezze dinner they we had. It was lovely and a real bit of culture.    Roof terrace is fantastic although be aware there is no pool on the roof - it's inside. Hammam and massage was also lovely.    Would recommend this riad for anyone but particularly short city breaks where you want a bit of culture and some romantic luxury.    If you like a drink or two head for the Cozy bar - look for the big tree (really big and covered head to toe in foliage looks like the tree of life) about 60 metres to the south of the riad - across the square - it's the best place we found... aside from the Riad itself of course which was a lovely spot for a G & T.,Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Reigate, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adamg533

The briefing from Samir was the most helpful and useful we got at any of the Riads at which we had stayed. He listened carefully to our interests and really helped us plan OUR stay not some generic stay.    The whole staff was just as helpful whether bringing us water and OJ without being asked after we came back from hours of walking or finding my wife's lost wedding ring or helping us move to the room upgrade we were given for the second night. They were a charming balance between ""professional 5 star service"" and ""local charm"" always eager to please on the smallest ways but just a little shy in doing it too.    The Riad itself was beautiful (though if an upgrade isn't available and you like extra space in your room paying for the bigger room or small suite is money well spent). The rooftop terrace where a varied and delicious breakfast of local fare is served was utterly delightful and all the public areas were gorgeous and comfortable at the same time.    All of that said it was the staff every single one of them that made this place as special as it is. I would recommend the pampering of this place to anyone.

Riad Dar Anika,Jacqueline K wrote a review Nov 2014,50,The only place to stay in Marrakech,My husband and I were completely bowled over by the hospitality and service at this beautiful Riad. It was my birthday whilst on the trip and they organised a cake and flowers and treated me like a Princess for the whole stay.The Manager Samir takes you under his wing from the moment you step through the door - his staff provide welcoming refreshments and he goes through a map of Marrakech offering advice on sight seeing restaurants and things to steer clear of. We took advantage of their car service (fee paying) to ferry us at night and on our trip to the mountains and their driver was likewise amazingly friendly and polite. The accommodation was beautiful - offering both traditional Moroccan decor with modern amenities (except TV - but why would you need that??). Touches like rose petals scattered in your room and Argan oils products in terracotta pots in your bathroom just add to the luxury. We were more than pleased with the breakfast where we expected a typical bland continental fare - we were given a banquet of yogurt fruit warm pancakes and muffins jam and honey and drinks galore. Taking up the manager's recommendations we ate somewhere different every night and on the last night had dinner at the Riad - at the end of which we wished we had ate there more; dinner was served under a Bedouin type tent on the roof terrace and every course was sumptuous - even the Camel tagine ordered by my husband! We were even given a packed lunch for the airport! We organised a Hamman and massage at the Riad and although the Hamman is on the small side the accompanying body scrub was invigorating and again administered by a very enthusiastic therapist. On the last day we followed a tip in our guide to try and spend the day by the pool in the nearest 5 start hotel - only to be told they were full by abrupt snooty staff which was such a stark contract to the staff at Anika.

Riad Dar Anika,ACH10 wrote a review Oct 2014,50,"Excellent service, perfect place!",If like me you have spent hours or days researching which Riad to stay in during your trip to Marrakech I promise you that you will not be disappointed with this one!  From my first enquiry to when we left the hotel with a lovely packed lunch they had made for us the service here could not have been more friendly and helpful. They really do make you feel special and nothing is too much trouble.  The Riad is just on the entrance to the Souks so you don't have to meander through them with all your luggage - personally I think it is on the perfect spot. It is a few minutes walk to the main square but far enough away to be peaceful.  The Riad itself is beautiful. It smells lovely is clean tidy homely and is the most relaxing and tranquil place I have ever stayed. It is true that what another reviewer said...the photos do not do it justice.  Our room was on the ground floor and was beautifully laid out when we arrived with rose petals on the beds and in the bathroom. It was clean and there was plenty of room. We also found it to be quiet and got some lovely nights sleep. No call to prayer heard at all (as I have seen mentioned in some of the other Riad reviews).  We ate at the hotel the first night and the food was fabulous....there is so much of it though...make sure you don't eat much beforehand! The service was charming and it was such a lovely experience eating the wonderful food on the roof terrace.  Breakfast is also eaten on the terrace and again is plentiful. They bring out lots of dishes which are all lovely - especially the yoghurt and cake!  The owners make themselves available should you need any help at all and will gladly sit down with a map and give you hints and tips on where to go and any things to avoid. We followed most of their advice and enjoyed a lovely couple of days.  The roof terrace has 4 sun loungers if like me you want to catch a few rays in between all the sights. Again it is most relaxing and peaceful there. Also you won't be sitting down for long before a complimentary mint tea or any other drink you fancy is brought along to you.  Honestly the staff just want to make your stay as nice as they can do.  I really did spend days looking on Trip Advisor for the right place to stay (and there are lots of Riads with good ratings in Marrakech) but I am so pleased I chose this one. I wouldn't even look next time I would definitely come back here.  One piece of advice for those of you who haven't been to Marrakech before.....expect delays getting through passport control!! There were lots of booths open when we arrived but the queuing system was shambolic! Once you are through though it is all worth it and the lovely man from the Dar Anika will be there to escort you to the peace and relaxation of the Riad which is only about a 15 minute drive away.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Shepperton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ACH10

By ""experience"" I mean that this is much MORE than just a remarkable place. It is extremely clean it's beauty is indescribably (the pictures on line do not do it justice) and the location is perfect (just short stroll from the square at the edge of the medina and yet easy to taxi to...so no need to drag your luggage down bustling streets). But the owner and staff are also very special. Upon our arrival we were greeted with a celebration of wonderful Moroccan snacks and of course mint tea. We had a fantastic diner on the roof top terrace and they even packed a lunch for us as we headed off to the train station. Couldn't ask for a better place!",Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Denver, Colorado",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThePhilosophe

The riad itself is nicely appointed and very tranquil after a day on the streets. Our room was spacious cool and very quiet. The food is excellent and the service is fantastic. Any time we would return to the riad we were greeted with mint tea ice water and snacks.

Riad Dar Anika,Corinne S wrote a review Sep 2014,50,Unparalleled service …,As a frequent business traveller I thought I had experienced some of the best customer service in the world – from the immaculate new 6 star hotels in India to the historic grandeur of The Ritz. I have been fortunate enough to have stayed in a number of wonderful hotels that take excellent care of the requirements of their guests but never before have I stayed in a hotel that anticipated all of our needs! Not once did we ever have to ask for assistance. Samir and his team have perfected the art of caring for their clientelle in this boutique hotel so your enjoyment of the Marrakesh experience could not be better.    Dar Anika provides a wonderful cool sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of the city. The hospitality that greets you on arrival continues throughout your stay. There is always a combination of fresh pastries fruit smoothies goats’ milk dates and chilled water to greet your return to this amazing cool oasis.    Our air-conditioned room was not over-sized but we had selected according to our budget for this trip. There was much more spacious accommodation available however our room was more than adequate for our needs - beautifully cool extremely clean and had a lovely bathroom with a highly effective shower. And for the occasional call of work the wi-fi was both fast and reliable.    The roof terrace provides a lovely garden setting for breakfast which was absolutely delicious and extremely generous. Indeed after the first morning we started to share some of the courses to minimize waste. In addition to the fresh fruit and yoghurt cake pancakes bread and soup we had also been offered eggs which we would never have managed to eat.    The honesty of the hotel directory and Samir’s introductory talk is both refreshing and invaluable. We might certainly have been tempted to buy “fresh” orange juice from the vendors in the Souk had Samir not warned us of the potential hazards of added water.    Samir also provides some excellent restaurant recommendations but the dinner we had at Dar Anika was unparalleled despite all that Marrakesh has to offer. The slow-cooked lamb pot-roasted in coals of the Hammam was the highlight of our trip. The proprietor explained that the hotel also makes an effort to serve Western Europeans with vegetables that retain a little bite in preference to the local tradition for softer vegetables for ease of eating with bread.    Samir and team arrange excursions with Khalid who also speaks excellent English and drives probably the cleanest car in Marrakesh! And at the end of the journey there is the Dar Anika plunge pool awaiting on your return. Having the hotel arrange for Khalid to collect you from the airport is a decision you will not regret and will ensure that your trip gets off to the best possible start – arguably the most important €22 that you will spend in Marrakesh.    We stayed for four days and ventured out to the coast for a day trip in the middle. For us this was the perfect duration. This was our first trip to Marrakesh and we had expected it to be a “once in a lifetime” experience but the excellent service we received at Dar Anika has determined that we shall return. Next time we will take things more slowly bring a book and spend some time on the loungers on the roof as a contrast to the intensity of the city. We will also undertake some research in advance on the price of leather Gladstone bags (which looked much better quality than those we saw in Florence last year) hurricane lamps lights and the other treasures that await in the Souks.    It’s definitely not for the faint hearted – Marrakesh has sights sounds tastes and smells that are very alien to those of us from the West which can be both wonderful and shocking. But it is the enthusiasm of the vendors the vibrancy of the colours the fragrance of the spices and the cool professional calm of the Dar Anika which will linger in the memory.    If only all hotels could be this good…. thank you team Dar Anika for the perfect stay.,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Chichester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CorinneS440

Riad Dar Anika,Corinne S wrote a review Sep 2014,50,Unparalleled service …,As a frequent business traveller I thought I had experienced some of the best customer service in the world – from the immaculate new 6 star hotels in India to the historic grandeur of The Ritz. I have been fortunate enough to have stayed in a number of wonderful hotels that take excellent care of the requirements of their guests but never before have I stayed in a hotel that anticipated all of our needs! Not once did we ever have to ask for assistance. Samir and his team have perfected the art of caring for their clientelle in this boutique hotel so your enjoyment of the Marrakesh experience could not be better.    Dar Anika provides a wonderful cool sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of the city. The hospitality that greets you on arrival continues throughout your stay. There is always a combination of fresh pastries fruit smoothies goats’ milk dates and chilled water to greet your return to this amazing cool oasis.    Our air-conditioned room was not over-sized but we had selected according to our budget for this trip. There was much more spacious accommodation available however our room was more than adequate for our needs - beautifully cool extremely clean and had a lovely bathroom with a highly effective shower. And for the occasional call of work the wi-fi was both fast and reliable.    The roof terrace provides a lovely garden setting for breakfast which was absolutely delicious and extremely generous. Indeed after the first morning we started to share some of the courses to minimize waste. In addition to the fresh fruit and yoghurt cake pancakes bread and soup we had also been offered eggs which we would never have managed to eat.    The honesty of the hotel directory and Samir’s introductory talk is both refreshing and invaluable. We might certainly have been tempted to buy “fresh” orange juice from the vendors in the Souk had Samir not warned us of the potential hazards of added water.    Samir also provides some excellent restaurant recommendations but the dinner we had at Dar Anika was unparalleled despite all that Marrakesh has to offer. The slow-cooked lamb pot-roasted in coals of the Hammam was the highlight of our trip. The proprietor explained that the hotel also makes an effort to serve Western Europeans with vegetables that retain a little bite in preference to the local tradition for softer vegetables for ease of eating with bread.    Samir and team arrange excursions with Khalid who also speaks excellent English and drives probably the cleanest car in Marrakesh! And at the end of the journey there is the Dar Anika plunge pool awaiting on your return. Having the hotel arrange for Khalid to collect you from the airport is a decision you will not regret and will ensure that your trip gets off to the best possible start – arguably the most important €22 that you will spend in Marrakesh.    We stayed for four days and ventured out to the coast for a day trip in the middle. For us this was the perfect duration. This was our first trip to Marrakesh and we had expected it to be a “once in a lifetime” experience but the excellent service we received at Dar Anika has determined that we shall return. Next time we will take things more slowly bring a book and spend some time on the loungers on the roof as a contrast to the intensity of the city. We will also undertake some research in advance on the price of leather Gladstone bags (which looked much better quality than those we saw in Florence last year) hurricane lamps lights and the other treasures that await in the Souks.    It’s definitely not for the faint hearted – Marrakesh has sights sounds tastes and smells that are very alien to those of us from the West which can be both wonderful and shocking. But it is the enthusiasm of the vendors the vibrancy of the colours the fragrance of the spices and the cool professional calm of the Dar Anika which will linger in the memory.    If only all hotels could be this good…. thank you team Dar Anika for the perfect stay.,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Chichester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CorinneS440

Riad Dar Anika,cincywoman wrote a review Oct 2014,50,Excellent Riad!,Dar Anika was a great place to stay in Marrakesh. The location is within walking distance of all the major sights of the city. The riad itself is nicely appointed and very tranquil after a day on the streets. Our room was spacious cool and very quiet. The food is excellent and the service is fantastic. Any time we would return to the riad we were greeted with mint tea ice water and snacks. The manager took the time to sit down with us to point out things we should not miss in the city and the things to avoid. Loved the outside terrace on the top of the riad that provided a great view of the busy streets below.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Cincinnati, OH",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cincywoman

Riad Dar Anika,Miles T wrote a review Oct 2014,50,An oasis in the madness that is Marrakech,With over 1500 (apparently) Riads in Marrakech it would be hard to choose - luckily I stumbled upon Dar Anika and what a find. From the moment we arrived from our airport transfer we were greeted by manager Samir and his team with chilled water mint tea and a rose ( I admit I told my wife i'd organised that one!). The team could not have done more for us throughout our stay and the hotel is simply top class. The rooms clean the beds comfortable and the terrace a haven looking down onto the street below. Dinner in house was a treat and just kept coming!! Also the in house Hammam with massage after was a fabulous way to unwind on one of our days. To end it all we were presented with a picnic for our journey home and the owner came to say goodbye too.  If you need a place to stay in Marrakech then look no further than Dar Anika.

Riad Dar Anika,willietaylor2014 wrote a review Oct 2014,50,First class/5 Star. I experienced the best service I have ever had.,The place is gorgeous location is perfect but the team are outstanding. Samir and his team literally thought of and catered for our every need. Their quiet understated approach is special and means that the little touches made a huge contribution to our enjoyment of our trip. The briefing and insight into Marrakesh set us up perfectly the incredible lack of hard sell of their own services/offerings was very comfortable the delivery of ice cold water and fresh mint tea after a day out and about much appreciated the bottles of water casually handed-over when leaving for a day out were thoughtful the picnic beautifully presented in a little silk bag prepared (without request) for our home-bound journey was the icing on the cake....I name only a few of the little things Samir & his team have very cleverly thought through and deliver as part of the price.

Riad Dar Anika,Chris F wrote a review Oct 2014,50,A really first class place,We arrived in Marrakech after a much-delayed flight and long wait in Morocco immigration. Dar Anika arranged our pickup at the airport and the driver was present and waiting even though we were several hours behind schedule. We received a traditional warm welcome at Dar Anika with mint tea and were presented with a wonderful meal that was beyond our capacity to finish.    Throughout our week at Riad Dar Anika we found Samir's hard-working staff to be consistently professional friendly and very helpful. This included organizing trips taxis providing advice meals drinks a wonderful breakfast each morning and more. Our room and in-fact the whole Riad Dar Anika was very clean. We felt welcome and treated like royalty.    Marrakech being a very busy and somewhat noisy city once entering the Dar Anika it was an oasis of tranquillity! We enjoyed our visit to Marrakech and would highly recommend the Riad Dar Anika.

Riad Dar Anika,Jo P wrote a review Jul 2014,50,Superb,We have stayed in many hotels. But this has to be the best Hotel/Raid we have stayed in. From our arrive in Marrakech we made to feel like very special guest. Abu (the owner) had arranged for us to be picked up from the airport by one of his drivers. Who spoke very good english. Upon arriving at Dar Anika we were greeted with a very traditional Mint Tea and Moroccan nibbles. Our room was stunning. We had rose petals arranged beautifully around the room. The next morning we had a wonderful breakfast on the roof terrance. The staff were very attentive . We had different courses of food.We then had a meeting with Abu (owner) who wanted to know if we wanted an any recommendations of what to do for our stay in Marrakech. We are so pleased we took up this offer. Abu arranged a artillery for us. We also told Abu what kind of restaurant / entertainment we wanted for the evenings. This was also arranged for us. First day we got the feel of Marrakech by walking around the Souks (markets). That evening was the eve of my birthday. Abu had arranged a surprise birthday cake for me at the restaurant we were eating at ! On my birthday after breakfast all the staff from Dar Anika brought out a cake and sang Happy Birthday to me in Arabic and Berber. It was truly amazing. Our driver Ali then took as on our excursions. Visited Moroccan Villages via Altas Mountains. Learnt so much about the Berber way of life. Very humbling. Once back a Dar Anika we had a Hummam (Moroccan bath) . On our last day we went on a cooking course this was the high light. Abu became our friend.

Arrangements were made for the hotel's driver to pick us up at the Airport when we arrived. Highly recommend this service and reasonable enough. Also arranged with hotel for a driver to the airport when we departed. We left for the airport at 5:30A and the driver was waiting for us. The hotel arranged to have breakfast ready for us at 5:00A and even packed a small snack for us to take on our flight. Drivers escorted us from hotel door to vehicle each time. Lovely breakfast included each day with the room rate. Breakfast served in the rooftop terrace. Our rooms were on the second floor. No elevator available. A lovely welcome greeting with different Moroccan foods to taste and drinks. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. Rose pedals on the beds and throughout the bathrooms. Good location in the old town area. Have nothing but positive things to say about this hotel and the location. Try their dinner one night. It is wonderful.

Abu Samir and the whole team were faultless in the care and service they provided. We took advantage of them arranging our trips (city walking tour and Atlas mountain trips with Mustafa and Mohammed) which were first class and we would recommend them to everyone. The Riad itself is a lovely calm oasis and we ate most of our excellent meals on the stunning roof terrace overlooking the Atlas Mountains. The other treats we experienced were the Hammam followed by an excellent massage and also the swimming pool which was lovely brilliant after a very hot day of outings.

The traditional Moroccan welcome far exceeded any normal welcome -- they served us not only dates milk juice and mint tea but also delicious cakes. They brought the left overs to our room which was adorned with rose petals and was simply beautiful. Abu reviewed with us all information we needed to know to make our stay successful and even packed a delicious box lunch for us to take on the plane the day we left when he realized that we didn't have time for breakfast that morning because of a busy sightseeing schedule. Breakfast on the upstairs patio was not only delicious and varied but the service incomparable.

We were greeted with roses cookies and mint tea as well as a personal welcome from the riad owner. At Dar Anika we felt as though we were family members. We were truly treated like we were at home and we knew that the staff really cared about our well-being.    We highly recommend eating at Dar Anika. The dinners were exceptional! We booked the camel tangia for the first night of arrival and it was surely one of the most memorable and tastiest meals we ate in Morocco. Each morning we were excited to enjoy the enormous breakfasts on the beautiful rooftop terrace with our friend Couscous the turtle!    Our room was simple but beautiful with every amenity we could anticipate needing (including cookies in the fridge!). After exploring the city every day it was a delight to come back to a sparkling clean exceptionally comfortable bedroom every night.    A large part of Dar Anika's charm is how much care is taken with guests. When we arrived Mr. Abu took the time to point out places he thought we would enjoy and mapped everything in the medina out for us. We know we had memorable experiences at shops restaurants and in markets because of his advice!    The location of this riad is absolutely perfect. It's a simple 5 minute walk North to the ""big square"" Jemma El Fna. We have stayed in other riads and Dar Anika was most perfectly situated by far.    The entire staff was wonderful helping us with our needs before we even knew we needed assistance! No task was too complicated or too small for the Dar Anika team to handle.    One of the reasons we are planning a trip back to Marrakech in 2015 is to stay at this riad! We can't wait to book another stay with our ""Moroccan family"". It was a comforting feeling to know the answer to our questions was always ""Of course yes.""

Riad Dar Anika,Clifford S wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Oasis Boutique,Driving closer to the Medina the streets got narrower busier and cluttered with alley-side vendors. As we left the main street after finding the tiny street were looking for we began to have doubts about our hotel choice. Then sandwiched between street vendors was a beautiful doorway cut into an otherwise nondescript wall. A very quiet knock was immediately answered by two uniformed bellboys who escorted us out of the 100 degree afternoon into an A/C relaxation room. Treated to tea sweet cakes and a welcome by the manager we filled out our registration paper work on the comfort of couches and easy chairs not by standing at a counter in the lobby.. An added treat was the rose water a young girl poured over our hands and very welcome was the cold wash cloths we were given to freshen up. Brought then to our room we were very pleasantly surprised by it. The hotel is lovely the staff just waiting to serve whatever needs we had. The room was spacious clean and very comfortable and inviting. Beds were firm. Third bed for grandson was a real bed not a roll-a-way. Breakfast on the roof garden was fresh varied and plentiful. The pool in the lobby was inviting though we did not use it. As indicated location was excellent and we walked to the central square where all the action is in about 5 minutes down an interesting shopping street. We would definitely recommend to anyone and cannot think of any negatives we experienced here.

A friendly oasis in the ""Real Marrakech"" (i.e. not the Four Seasons part of town). My wife and I were treated like royalty from the moment we arrived. The room was exceptionally clean and the hotel was tranquil. Oh yes and they ordered us a cake in celebration of our anniversary. Great roof deck bar as well.

Riad Dar Anika,Dee F wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Amazing Riad!!!! Must VISIT,The Riad is located in a fantastic location and the Riad is beautiful. I absolutely LOVED it! They give you a warm welcome and the staff is amazing.    !The staff will go out of their ways to help you and service you. !    I think our choice of staying at this Riad made our trip way more magical and amazing rather than staying at a regular hotel. Their breakfast... omg...I miss it right now. It was amazing. All the food was amazing. Every recommendation they made to us in terms of restaurants spas and places to visit turned out absolutely amazing.  To be honest I have been to many hotels around the world...but this Riad is by far the best I have been to as they make you feel at home and their service alone deserves 5 stars!,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dohaf2014
Riad Dar Anika,TasM114 wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Beautiful,Recently returned following a short stay in Marrakech. Was slightly anxious when the taxi pulled up outside an alleyway and announced we'd arrived however we were warmly welcomed into the riad by the manager Samir and shown into a beautiful riad away from the hustle and bustle outside. We were given dates tea and biscuits and then sat down with Samir to discuss the do's and dont's of Marrakech advised on places we might like to visit and on some good places to eat. This allowed us to make the most of our time there.    The staff were very polite and friendly throughout our stay. They went above and beyond the call of duty in facilitating us. On our final day we had a late flight so they provided us with a packed lunch as we were leaving which was very thoughtful. The hotel was clean and lovely and peaceful away from the busy streets of Marrakech. If we needed anything (e.g. An iron) it was provided promptly. The breakfast was also great.    The location was ideal. We were within walking distance of most tourist attractions.    We wanted to visit the Atlas Mountains and that was sorted immediately. We had a very good and friendly driver Ali who was very accommodating and polite throughout.    Overall a great stay in a beautiful riad with lovely staff. The only regret was not having enough time in Marrakech to spend more time enjoying the riad. Would definitely recommend to others and go again in future.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Leeds, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TasM114
Riad Dar Anika,Brigit V wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Very Nice,Was here just for the night in a double room! I love traditional style riads as they are always so beautiful and much more homely than 4 star hotels filled with tourists!! Staff was quiet and shy but very polite and welcoming! Bed was comfy and the bath was huge!! Had breakfast on the courtyard downstairs which was delicious and very filling! the small pool is not heated but was still fine to dunk feet in and cool off! Views are not amazing on rooftop but its a nice place just to relax and have a drink and BBQ!

From the moment you enter you are looked after given tips on where to go and what to do local restaurants and many other tips. I usually stay in 5 star hotels so I have very high standards in terms of service and you totally get that here. It almost felt like there was a surprise around every corner - rose on arrival packed lunch etc. We didn't actually have time to eat at the riad but we walked past another table and the food looked amazing.

Riad Dar Anika,arich64 wrote a review May 2014,50,Excellent stay,What a little treasure. We were extremely pleased with our recent 3 night stay at the Riad. The staff were extremely helpful nothing was too much trouble. We had booked dinner for our first night but our arrival was delayed by 3 hours so by the time we arrived we couldn't face it. This was the right decision as we had the meal the following night and we couldn't have done it justice at 11 pm at night.    We booked the walking tour around Marrakech. This was an excellent choice as it made us feel at home in the city showed us some of the sites and then made us feel confident about walking around on our own.    The staff were extremely helpful in suggesting things for us to do places to visit and places to eat. We did eat at the La Mamournia hotel which is where Churchill used to stay. Very nice French meal but we really could have been in any 5 star hotel anywhere in the world.    In contrast the Moroccan meal at Dar Anika was excellent. The atmosphere is fantastic - all meals are eaten on the roof terrace and this is surrounded by the sights and sounds of Marrakech. We ate by candle light the most fantastic meal. We certainly couldn't have faced it at 11 pm the night before but we tried our best on the Friday night. We also had lunch on our last day before heading to the airport. Again another fantastic 'light meal' (3 courses) fish this time.    I would recommend that if you stay at this hotel you eat at least either one dinner or lunch here. You won't be disappointed.    In in all an excellent stay in an excellent Riad where the staff and management couldn't have done more to make your stay the best it could be. By the way after having worked in the travel industry (albeit 30 years ago) and travelled extensively this is the first hotel where I hadn't need to use my travel make up mirror as one was provided for you plus a reading light and hair dryer!,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arich64

Riad Dar Anika,Andy P wrote a review May 2014,50,Is this Riad as good as the reviews make it out to be?,We booked this Riad on the back of the outstanding reviews given by other guests that stayed at the Dar Anika. So lets cut to the chase – Is this Riad as good as the reviews make it out to be?    In short yes. Dar Anika gets a 10/10 from us and deservedly so. This establishment is run along the same ethos as Richard Branson runs Virgin Atlantic Airlines. It’s all about customer service and attention to detail so what follows is a more detailed insight into our stay.    On arrival at Marrakesh we were greeted by Anil who held up a board with ‘Dar Anika”. Anil was our VIP driver who took our bags from us and drove us to the Dar Anika Riad for our 4-night stay. The transport was clean comfortable (spacious leather seating) with cool air con for the 15-minute journey.    On arrival at the Dar Anika we were warmly greeted at the door by the manger (Samir) and as we walked through into the courtyard Samir introduced us to Fadwal who was standing tall and proud carrying a big smile as she greeted us and held out a long freshly cut stemmed red rose for my wife to receive. Wow what a stunning reception!    Samir and Fadwal then introduced us to the staff - they took our bags to our room (Suite – Room 2) whilst we were asked to take breakfast on the roof top gardens to unwind after our 3 hour 15 minute flight from the UK.    After breakfast we sat with Samir who explained the Do’s and Don’ts of Marrakesh when visiting the Medina. Samir also mapped out some quality restaurants for us to eat in (new and old town) and a whole lot more……..    We stayed in a Suite (Room 2). It was a stunning room; rose petals decorated the fresh white bed linen in the shape of a heart with a fresh bouquet of flowers placed on the centre of the bed. Above the bed was a stunning sky light dome feature (see photo) which became an even better feature of an evening.    We decided to have our first nights dinner at the Dar Anika and wow we did not go disappointed. The food was plentiful to say the least but more importantly it was excellent in quality and professionally presented. To top it all the chef and the kitchen staff came out after to dinner to sing me a happy birthday and greet me with a birthday cake.    The quality of service and attention to detail did not drop in standards after our 1st day. It remained constant throughout the 4 nights and nothing was too much trouble for Samir Fadwal and their team. Oh we also took in a Hammon and a massage which we would well recommend you do whilst staying at this Riad.    On departure from the Riad a packed lunch was handed to us for our flight back to the UK (Lemon chicken bread rolls fruit– stunning and a huge thank you) and our baggage was taken to our VIP driver for the 15-minute journey to Marrakesh Airport.    We wanted for nothing during our stay at this Riad and we felt so relaxed in this friendly but professionally well run Riad which felt like home – a far cry from these modern hotels that simply treat you as number once they have secured your money for your stay!    Top Tips:    (1) Get Samir or Fadwal to arrange for a professional tour guide to take you around the local points of attractions.    (2) Ask Samir or Fadwel to book you into the La Maison MK Restaurant – its stunning but get Samir to take you otherwise you will not find it on your own!    (3) Take a trip to the Atlas Mountains and Ourika Valley but make sure Samir and Fadel at the Riad arrange it for you. We spoke with others outside of this Riad who made their own arrangements – guess what they were hugely disappointed.    (4) Trust know one during your stay in Marrekesh and we mean know one other than the management and staff in the establishment that you are staying in.    A huge thank you once again for making our stay one to remember and your 10/10 rating is thoroughly deserved.,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Benfleet, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andyp970

Riad Dar Anika,Mili R wrote a review May 2014,50,Fantastic Hotel,I traveled with my kids my brother and his wife their kid and our parents.The hotel is perfectly located right in the Medina but not in a noisy area. It is beautiful. It is what I was hoping it would be: a boutique hotel with high standards in every way (I am a New Yorker and picky) yet still authentic to the place. I didn't want to feel I am at some corporate hotel when I am in Marrakech. The breakfast area is on the roof a gorgeous outdoor dining area with food as fresh and delicious as could be and cute turtles. There is a pool in the main floor though water was too cold to use (but we were there during spring maybe that's why we didn't want the cold water just yet). But what made the trip so special was the service. While super professional it was also personal. We felt like we came home every time we entered. Upon arrival we received traditional tea and moroccan sweets as well as roses. SAMIR the hotel manager was exceptionally excellent. He was caring detailed and very patient with jet lagged big family guests that we were. He sat down with us right away to plan our stay as to not spare a moment. His recommendations were sensational and made our trip unforgettable. He was right on target with what we hoped to experience and we did. The driver he arranged for us was super professional lovely and spoke English very well. During our stay every whim at every moment ANYTHING we needed was answered with a delightful attitude and competence by the whole staff. They made us feel at home.Thank you Samir and everyone at Dar Anika for making our trip so special.

Riad Dar Anika,Tim L wrote a review May 2014,40,Austravellers,We recently stayed at Dar Anika and found the staff extremely friendly and accommodating to all requests. It is more intimate than larger riads and hotels but that just adds to the extra level of service you get from the staff.    Morning breakfasts on the roof terrace are very filling and give you a good start for the day.  A recommendation is to book and eat dinner at the riad one night but make sure you are hungry as it is a big feast and we couldn't finish.  The riad itself offers a little oasis in the busy streets of Marrakech and an escape during the hot summer days and is within a 10min walk in all directions of nearly all of the medinas main sites.,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Perth, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timl888
Riad Dar Anika,sunschein44 wrote a review May 2014,50,Fantastic experience,This Riad is an oasis among the chaos and heat.  We (two female friends) stayed in early April and the reviews on this site are completely accurate. We had a fantastic experience from the moment we were picked up at the airport until we were dropped back to the airport. There was nothing they would not help us with. Samir met with us right away to find out what our needs were what we wanted to do and offered us guidance on how to make our visit most enjoyable.    We had dinner the first night on the roof top terrace and the food and local wine were wonderful.  Breakfast is a feast - by the second day we had to ask that they just bring us fruit and yoghurt (which was amazing on its own).  We did opt in for the Hammam and massage and it was worth it. The only thing is I would suggest is going separate. My friend and I went at the same time and space was a bit cramped for the two of us plus the lady providing the treatment.  Being two women travelling alone we did also request a private driver for dinners out.  The restaurant recommendations did not disappoint. Again wonderful. The hotel also found a driver to take us on an excursions. We are so happy we did.    I would highly recommend staying here. You will not be disappointed.

Arrived early morning. Greeted at the airport and within minutes where sitting on the roof terrace of this Splendid Raid eating the most delicious breakfast. The room was beautiful but couldn't wait to step out into the medina with great advise and guidance from the super friendly staff we did just that.    Ideally situated for site-seeing everything within a short walk. The location also contributing towards the remarkable contrast between what is on the door step and how it feels inside. The excitement noise and bustle of the bazaar yet the minute you step into the Riad and door is shut behind you all falls silent and calm completely uninterrupted apart from the call for prayers which is the only noise that seems to penetrate the walls.    It's just lovely just to lounge around in the raid. My favourite place is roof terrace enjoying the breeze with views to Atlas Mountains.

Riad Dar Anika,Ken S wrote a review Apr 2014,50,A Wonderful Oasis,It's difficult to know where to start in reviewing this oasis in the hustle and bustle that is Marrakech. I guess the overwhelming impression is the wonderful service and attention that all of the staff gave us during our visit. From the moment we were collected from the airport nothing was too much trouble and the level of service was impeccable far exceeding any expectations that we might have had. Samir and his team really are faultless.    The riad itself is perfectly located - right on the edge of the old souk close to three of the major attractions but only 10 mins walk from the main square so everything is in easy walking distance.    Inside the riad has been elegantly converted with the rooms around the traditional courtyard into which they have been able to fit a welcoming pool. Every room is different so each have their own charm and quirkiness but all are cleaned and decorated to a high standard.    The flexibility of the spaces in the riad were excellent - you could have breakfast in the courtyard on the balcony level or on the rooftop terrace. Despite visiting in February we were able on a couple of days to eat on the terrace which has great views across the rooftops. On a couple of evenings we ate in the lounge area which has a glass wall overlooking the courtyard and for the cold evenings a roaring log fire too.    The food was exceptional - both of the evening meals were excellent and the breakfasts almost overwhelming in the quality and quantity of the food.    There were a number of occasions where the staff really went out of their way to help us and to provide a level of service that we don't think we have encountered anywhere else.    We cannot think of a reason why anyone visiting Marrakech should want to stay anywhere else other than Dar Anika. When we return we will certainly be back here.,Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Southport,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scuban0vice

This was the 2nd time I have stayed in Marrakech and Dar Anika was perfect even better than my previous stay which I thought was amazing. The communication before we went was spot on. We got picked up at the airport which was really easy. The transfer is only 15 mins to Riad. Best of both worlds as it is in the Medina very close to Main Square and the Markets but nice and peaceful when in the Riad. Everything else of interest is walking distance or taxi if you want to be lazy. All the staff are fantastic and if you needed anything you just had to ask. They all smiled and greeted you - even cleaners who did not speak any english were so friendly. All recommendations for restaurants and stuff were good. Samir is the manager and he was around a lot to make sure we were happy with the stay. Our taxi driver (Zacharay) who we asked for as we liked him the first time was a good laugh and his English was good. We ate at the Riad one night and it was really good (I had Camel).

The room was a bit small for the four of us but still nice quiet and clean/nice. The service is better than in some of the 5 star hotels we stayed in.  The dinner the first night was very nice but some more choice for other evenings would be a good idea (but then you have all the medina and can go to all the other places).

Riad Dar Anika,Naimul2014 wrote a review Apr 2014,50,Fantastic--The best service I have experienced,From the moment you arrive in Marrakech whether by train or air the staff at Dar Anika are preparing for your visit. We were picked up by their driver at the train station and taken directly to the Riad. At the door we were greeted by the full staff who had a rose for my wife and a porter for our bags. We were led into a waiting area where we were served fresh milk and dates followed by pastries and mint tea. The proprietor arrived and detailed the surrounding area using a map highlighting the placed we should go and when we should go there. Our room was upgraded and upon entry we found it covered in flower petals. The hot water was hot the linens crisp and fresh and our hosts were most hospitable. I've stayed at Ritz-Carltons 7 Diamond Vegas hotels and lavish all inclusive Mexican resorts and I've never felt so welcome and well served as I did at Dar Anika. Upon our departure the staff went so far as to provide us a sack lunch for the car ride.

They arranged a 3 day 2 night desert experience that used the hotel as home base to store unneeded luggage while we went thru the Atlas Mountains thru the Darr Valley. They arranged car service in the evenings to take us to and from local restaurants as well as airport pickup. The facility was great and the food better than several restaurants that we visited for dinner. The beef tijan is a most. Breakfast was terrific ..

Riad Dar Anika,Julian M wrote a review Apr 2014,50,Excellent family break,Stayed at Dar Anika with our family. Fabulous stay - great riad with excellent plunge pool and roof terrace. Staff were exceptionally helpful and attentive. Roof terrace is a wonderful haven - particularly at night for sipping mint tea in peace and quite after the hustle of the square.    Rooms were quiet and peaceful (we had 3) and we all benefitted from an excellent night's sleep - even the call from the mosques was muted - we know from previous stays in other riads that it can be quite noisy!    Location is perfect - close enough to souks and close to the main palaces.

Riad Dar Anika,David A wrote a review Apr 2014,50,First class Riad,We can’t think of anywhere better to stay in Marrakech.    It’s been beautifully restored and so is a pleasing space to return to after the hustle and bustle of the city. The service is excellent. We were greeted with milk and dates followed by mint tea and pastries. All our needs were impeccably looked after – arranging a guide taxis Hammam massage. The food was excellent and plentiful. Having breakfast on the roof is a great way to start the day – with yoghurt fruit orange juice eggs cooked as you want them unusual breads. The pool offered a refreshing way to cool after a day sight seeing. Add to all that the location – just minutes from the Bahia and Badii palaces the Sadiaan tombs and five minutes walk to the souks. But really it is the staff who make the place feel so relaxing. All of them were attentive and very good at what they did. Would highly recommend and would stay there again,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R6245HXdavida
Riad Dar Anika,Sarah M wrote a review Apr 2014,50,very authentic,The rooms and the service were excellent and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The Riad has a lot of charme and feels very authentic.  Apparently it is one of the very very few Riads that is actually Moroccan managed. Most other Riads are owned by foreigners.  The guided city tour by a certified guide that is included in the rate is the perfect way to start off the visit to Marrakesh and the equally included massage is a good way to relax after a day of visiting the city.  If you have a light sleep the one thing you should not forget are earplugs. While you do not have any noise from the outside the wooden doors of the rooms open onto the inner court of the Riad and you can hear everything that is going on within the Riad.,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Palermo, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahmA4204YP
Riad Dar Anika,KirstiBella wrote a review Mar 2014,50,The perfect trip away from a busy life,I stayed here with two friends in late Feb and had an amazing time. We were collected from the airport and received a lovely welcome by the staff at the Riad which set the scene for the perfect stay in Marrakesh. The food was amazing whether it was the amazing luxury dinner on the first night the delicious endless breakfast or the never ending tea and cake oh and even a packed lunch on our way to the airport.  The room was warm and inviting and it felt like a safe haven from the world outside.  The staff were the really amazing part though they thought of everything apart from the obvious delicious delights above they also arranged a great trip at one of the local hammam gave us pointers on how to get around things to watch out for and always had a welcoming smile we came back from our walks to the Madina. Since coming home I’ve missed it every day and am planning my next trip back. I’ve recommended this beautiful Riad to friends since coming home and wouldn’t hesitate to return myself in a heartbeat.,Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KirstiBella
Riad Dar Anika,22inarow wrote a review Mar 2014,50,Oasis of peace,"What a fantastic wee break at Dar Anika.....    Whilst the previous reviewers have covered most of the major points I have to say my own thank you and add my recommendation to this site.    From the moment we were collected at the airport we were treated with such hospitality and respect. We arrived late but were welcomed with refreshments and moist towels plus a rose for the lady. After the initial bedlam of the airport and journey into town Dar Anika was almost totally silent and very tranquil.    After time to freshen up we enjoyed a banquet in the raid's covered courtyard. The food was utterly fantastic and so much of it....... Given another opportunity I would have this another night. We were not able to do credit to the meal - simply too knackered after the 2 flight journey from Scotland.    On our first morning after an amazing breakfast our genial and welcoming host Abu enquired after what we wanted to see and do in Marrakech. He gave us a map and illustrated what he thought we would like to see an interesting route to follow with timely rest stop plus gentle indications of ""Do's & Don'ts"".    Anytime we returned to Dar Anika it was so relaxing to step from the friendly madness of the streets into the cool and friendly welcome of the raid.    I cannot ever recall having previously enjoyed a breakfast that included fresh fruit salad cake freshly squeezed orange juice fresh Moroccan bread and pancakes eggs scones with preserves fresh coffee.... and SOUP!. It was all delicious heartening and just what we needed to set us up for a day in the Medina. Breakfast is served on the roof terrace with great views of the nesting storks and in the company of the three resident tortoises.    I will recommend Dar Anika to anybody and everybody friends and strangers. I am sure Abu Samir and all the attentive respectful and well mannered staff will look after you.",Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,edinburgh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/22inarow

Riad Dar Anika,Matina S wrote a review Mar 2014,50,"A peaceful, atmospheric oasis",We recently came back from Marrakech. Riad Dar Anika made a difference to our trip. Not only it provided a hidden magical oasis in the middle of Medina but also because the decor the food and the above all the hospitality was excellent. We were greeted by lovely staff who offered us mint tea and local desserts before we were escorted to our room full of fresh aroma of rose petals that were scattered everywhere. Once we settled the manager spent an hour with us gave us a map and explained in detail best sites to see as well as practical information about what to avoid transport and safety. During our stay we booked a Hammam in the Riad which was fantastic followed by a private dining experience in the Riad's courtyard. They cooked camel meat for us which you don't find in restaurant menus. Really yummy. Before we left I was given a small gift and they had prepared for both myself and my husband packed lunch for the plane.

Riad Dar Anika,Lee R wrote a review Mar 2014,50,Truly Amazing,First time of writing on trip advisor but had to having had the most amazing stay at Riad Dar Anika.    Treated like royalty from the moment the driver met us at the airport. Abu and his staff have thought of everything to make your stay the most amazing experience. Attentive staff  eye for details and thoughtful on every level from arrival at the Riad where we were given traditional mint tea and dates to the pack lunch for your departure.    After a quick chat about what we wanted to do in Marrakech ideas were shared on where to visit and to where to dine. We were shown to our room which was dressed with petals and flowers then a quick show round to the rooftop terrace. The Riad could not be better located for the hustle and bustle which makes Marrakech a great place to visit and immerse yourself then re enter the Riad Dar Anika and all that disappears with the tranquility of its surroundings.

Riad Dar Anika,Flora717 wrote a review Mar 2014,50,"Beyond 5 star service, in your own little palace",Our flight was several hours late we were exhausted - until we arrived to a warm welcome and the most beautiful little riad with a glowing turquoise courtyard pool candles sweet scents a log fire in the salon the table laid for our dinner and not the slightest hint of irritation at the hour. We were fussy and fractious - and in ten minutes were soothed and happy and felt very well taken care of. Nothing was too much trouble and to my amazement it really felt genuine. The place is immaculate elegant and Abu the owner has exquisite taste. He came to meet us at breakfast the next day and made sure we had everything we needed to venture out into the city - and once again there was no sense of rush or being processed through the experience. The food there is great the hammam was a treat and I was completely taken aback when the staff gathered to present me with a (delicious) chocolate cake and sing happy birthday in English then Arabic complete with the chef's ululations. This is a long review because there are so many wonderful things about this riad. There are grander places there are more economical places but if you want a superb introduction to Marrakech to find a place you can feel both cosseted and at home and for service that money simply cannot buy Dar Anika is it.,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hastings, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flora717

Service was always attentive without being obtrusive the perfect balance.Recommendations are freely offered on what to see how to best navigate the local sellers and which restaurants to visit. Nice sized roof terrace for dinnerbreakfastchilling & sunbathing.Lovely food and very good local wines. The riad has its own small hammam with quality massage on offer carried out in a spare room if available or your own room.

Riad Dar Anika,Stephen S wrote a review Mar 2014,50,Truly an oasis of peace in a city of bustle,My wife and I stayed here at the end of February 2014 for a (very) long weekend and were spoilt by the staff throughout our stay.    Marrakech is a great city to visit but you certainly need a haven to return to when you get tired of the souks and Riad Dar Anika fully fits the bill. We had one of the suites which was full of character and really comfortable. But the real benefit of the Riad is the staff who simply can't do enough for you. This carries right up to the two brothers who own the Riad and who are keen to make sure that your stay is perfect. It is well worth listening to their recommendations for restaurants and making use of the Riad's car for airport transfers and to take you both to restaurants in the evening and pick you up when you are finished your meal.    If you have time a day trip to the Atlas mountains is a great day out but don't bother with the tanneries which are simply not pleasant and not interesting enough to compensate for the smell. We spent our first afternoon on a walking tour with a guide organised by the Riad and that was both interesting and helpful as it helped us get our bearings.,Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I3906VJstephens
Riad Dar Anika,Marie H wrote a review Mar 2014,50,Excellent location & brilliant service,I stayed at this Riad Feb 21st - 23rd with 2 of my friends for a long weekend break we were welcomed by lovely staff who gave us the first of many cups of mint tea milk dates and pastries. Our room was covered in rose petals to welcome us which was a nice thought. The set dinner that evening was generous delicious and beautifully presented and the accompanying entertainment was quite an experience! The roof top is a lovely place to relax and have breakfast. Breakfast each morning is done beautifully with variety on each morning of fresh breads crepes fruit coffee cake (yes for breakfast) - the yogurt is the best part. The room/ensuite/beds were very clean and comfortable. The staff really make this stay though nothing is a problem they are very attentive at all times and they were very helpful to recommend and arrange a suitable hammam experience within a set budget (Thank you Samir!). Don't say no to the pastries they are delicious and worth the indulgence. We found the location very convenient a short easy walk from the main square. When we checked out everything was in order the staff provided us immigration forms so we avoided delays at the airport and were thoughtful enough to pack a small lunch for us all as our flight time meant that we wouldn't have time to eat before we left. I would highly recommend this Riad for travellers wanting a unique experience that feels personal with a very high level of customer service.,Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/935marieh
Riad Dar Anika,Lorraine B wrote a review Feb 2014,50,Wonderful stay,Five of us stayed here as part of a 50th birthday celebration and the staff could not have been more helpful.  Our transport was waiting when we arrived and we were swiftly transferred to the Riad. As with most Riads behind the door there is a sense of peace and tranquility.  We were given cleansing towels milk and dates and refreshing mint tea and biscuits while the sights and places to visit were explained to us along with suggestions of where to eat and where not too!  All our rooms were lovely decorated with rose petals and supplied with bottled water fruit bowl and more Moroccan biscuits. Room 2 is really special with an open fireplace and beautiful cupola above the bed with small round skylights to let the moonlight in. Definitely the room to have.  There is a lovely plunge pool on the ground floor with the small lounge area. A roof terrace for drinks meals and sunbathing.  Breakfast was typically Moroccan with so much food. Fruit salad and yogurt fresh juice cake pastries crepes soup and eggs of your choice. Tea and coffee. Tea and coffee are available all day free of charge and pastries are available in the afternoon.  We had a celebratory dinner in the Riad served downstairs by the pool and I can only describe it as a banquet. Everything was traditional Moroccan including a selection of tagines salads vegetables and breads. This was followed by a surprise birthday cake. An absolutely wonderful meal and great atmosphere.  All the staff were very nice and nothing was too much trouble. They arranged taxis to other restaurants an excellent Hamman at the nearby Golf Hotel and advised us to fill in immigration cards before leaving for the airport to save the hassle once there.  All in all an excellent experience and would recommend it as a great place to stay in Marrakech where it is located very close to the main square and souks.,Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"St. Albans, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LorraineB179

Riad Dar Anika,L H wrote a review Feb 2014,50,"This place is awesome, just stay here!",We looked at so many options when trying to find our accommodation- as a small group of girls travelling as friends our priorities were somewhere that felt safe clean and comfortable.    We just arrived home from a few days at Dar Anika and want to go back now!    Samir and his staff team work hard to ensure guests feel welcome happy and relaxed.    From the moment we arrived they made sure we felt right at home and had everything we needed. One of our group had forgotten a toothbrush and asked about the nearest shop to go & buy a new one. Samir told us just to relax and before we had even unpacked Samir had gone & got a new brush and toothpaste!    We were particularly happy with the location. The medina is crazy intense & at times overwhelming so being able to come into the calmness of the riad and relax with tea & cake straight away was a welcome retreat. The cakes were different & tasty each day so even without the excuse of being frazzled & harassed tea and cake became our happy afternoon ritual.    Being able to walk safely on a well lit & populated street also helped us feel confident & independent with getting to & from the night markets. We noticed other accommodation options nearby were often down dark slightly dodgy looking alley ways. So I feel like we made the best choice for us. If ever we felt unsure about venturing out somewhere new a staff member would offer to show us the way or book a trusted taxi driver. This was really appreciated.    The staff arranged a hammam for us booking a driver to take us to & from at a very reasonable price. I recommend this experience after a busy day of walking.    The food at the riad is delicious as ardent foodies we are pretty fussy and I can safely say the breakfasts were a highlight of our day. SO MUCH FOOD! Freshly baked Moroccan style breads traditional soups. Fresh fruit & juices. All tasty. We also had the set menu and tried camel for the first time I recommend trying this it was actually quite good.    I will definitely chose this riad again & recommend it to anyone I know going to Marrakech.,Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NZstormgirl
Riad Dar Anika,KaBe wrote a review Feb 2014,50,The Fabulous Riad Dar Anika!,We have just returned from an incredible stay at Riad Dar Anika. If you want a real Marrakech experience with fantastic service then you should definitely stay here too.    Prior to arrival we arranged our airport transfers via email with Riad Dar Anika (complimentary if you book a suite) which I would highly recommend as you are dropped off at the nearest point a car can go (no cars on most streets in the Medina) and met by a member of staff to take you a few metres to the riad.    When we arrived were given cool towels rose water for our hands and a rose. Then we were served glasses of milk with dates followed by traditional mint tea with pastries while our bags were taken to our room. We were given a map and talked about what we would like to see in Marrakech with the owner. Anything was possible to arrange through the riad.    We stayed in room 1 which is one of the 2 suites in the riad and it was a gorgeous room. The staff had scattered rose petals everywhere and there were lots of thoughtful touches like fresh fruit pastries bottled water and fresh flowers. The bathroom was complete with little jars of toiletries towel dressing gowns and more flowers. It is a really beautiful room with stained glass windows and 4 poster bed all designed in traditional style. This room is away from the street and even though we didn’t use the specially designed sound proofing cushions for the windows (we chose to leave these in the cupboards) we slept really well and weren’t disturbed at all.    The highlight of our stay was the dinner we had on our first night. A table had been set for us downstairs by the pool but we really wanted to eat upstairs on the outside terrace. So we were given complimentary drinks as the staff quickly set a table for us in a traditional tent on the terrace. It really was the most romantic setting. The riad had emailed the menu for a 3 course set meal and we had chosen starters and main courses but didn’t expect the feast that we were served. I don’t want to spoil the surprise for anyone but this would be my biggest and number 1 recommendation in Marrakech because the food setting and service was simply stunning. We highly recommend the Special dish of Dar Anika which was a delicious camel and prune tagine. This incredible meal only cost £35 each excluding drinks and it was a true taste of Marrakech with real home cooked food.    We also booked a private hammam which I would highly recommend (about £30 each) which was well worth it. The whole experience lasted just over an hour and our skin felt amazing after all the scrubs oils and natural local products. Afterwards we sat in the lounge in front of a real fire and were served a fresh beetroot juice then a mint tea. It was my partners birthday and the staff chose this opportunity to bring him a homemade birthday cake flowers and sing happy birthday (in 4 different languages!!) which was really thoughtful and totally unexpected.    Complimentary tea and cake is served every afternoon but we preferred to sit on the top terrace with a few beers nuts and olives watching the streets below as the sun set with CousCous the resident tortoise.    Breakfast was a real treat and it was served whenever and wherever you wanted it. It was so fresh and the warm breads pancakes fruits and yoghurt and strong coffee set us up for the day we didn’t eat lunch as breakfast was so filling.    The riad is really beautiful. It is well maintained and a real Morrocan experience but it’s the staff and the service which make it stand above and beyond the rest. Every member of staff we met was warm genuine and friendly we felt like we were treated like royalty. The riad is a total oasis of calm in such a chaotic city. Marrakech is a must see city and a stay at Dar Anika will ensure you make the most of it.    I feel like this review is a little long but I really want to express what an amazing place this is and how wonderful the staff are. I don’t normally go back to the same city twice as I think there are so many places to visit but we both agreed that we would go back to Riad Dar Anika again and we would definitely book for longer than 2 nights as they made it such a special trip.,Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dmonster18

From the moment that we walked through the doors from the mayhem of the street into this peaceful haven we were made to feel so welcome; this Riad is a delight. The service from every member of staff was outstanding - absolutely faultless. There were so many lovely touches that made the service personal including cake flowers and all the staff gathering to sing happy birthday in 3 different languages on my husband's birthday!

The Riad and the rooms are extremely comfortable and charming a beautiful respite from the busy streets of Marrakech.

Riad Dar Anika,Charlotte V wrote a review Feb 2014,50,Dar Anika could not do enough for us,Before we even arrived Dar Anika had regular email contact giving us advice on services they provided and things we could do once in Marrakech. We booked transport from the airport hamman massage a guided tour of the city and a traditional Moroccan dinner for the night of our arrival even before getting there.    The pick up from the airport was seamless and we were glad that we had a driver that knew where to take us as the door to Dar Anika could be missed if you did not know where it was! Once you enter you are greeted by a beautiful tranquil oasis which is in stark contrast to the crazy hustle bustle of the Marrakech streets!    On our arrival we were taken to sit in a lovely lounge with a live fire and given fresh mint tea milk pastries and dates to refresh ourselves. Once we were settled the manager Samir came to sit with us and he gave us a map of the city and marked different places we should see such as the palaces souks and gardens and he also showed us where to go for lunch and dinners. He even offered us a free room upgrade but because our room had been so beautifully decorated with rose petals I didn’t want to move!    The dinner at Dar Anika is delicious but you need to make sure you have not eaten too much at lunch time as you receive a feast! The complimentary breakfast is also fantastic as you receive loads of dishes such as yoghurt fresh fruit salad pancakes cake warm bread SOUP!! and any type of eggs you care to name!    The guided tour of the city is a must as it helps you to get your bearings and allows you to see parts of the city you may miss if you were just to walk around on your own.    In the evenings Dar Anika were so fantastic and allowed us to use the lounge as our own personal place and we watched films on the TV by the fire with a bottle of wine on a couple of occasions. One night we went to Comptoire (a restaurant with belly dancing) that Samir has recommended and that was really fantastic. Another MUST SEE is the Circus. You are able to hold baby lions and the circus acts are astounding! It is great great value for money!    We were unfortunate with the weather as it was quite cold and rainy on a couple of days but on those days Dar Anika arranged for a lady to come to the Riad to provide Hamman for us both then separate ladies to come in and do traditional Moroccan massages and Samir even organised free of charge for a lady to come in a do henna for me.    The Wi-Fi has a good connection and my partner was able to deal with work emails quickly and efficiently.    The staff at Dar Anika cannot do enough for you. We had great banter with our waiters and on the day it was sunny we were able to eat breakfast on the roof under a beautiful tent.  Overall I would thoroughly recommend Dar Anika for couples looking for a romantic getaway. Due to the fact that there are only 12 rooms the service is so personal and Dar Anika will bend over backwards to make your stay a special one. On our last day we were even given complimentary glasses of wine whilst we waited for our taxi to take us to the airport and then we were given a delicious packed lunch to take to the airport!!! I would most definitely go back and would recommend Dar Anika to my friends.,Date of stay: January 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlottev407

Dar Anika staff show a real interest in guests comfort and holiday enjoyment and go out of their way to ensure you are comfortable.

All rooms are modern with telephone Wi-fi safe and air-conditioned and equipped with private bathroom. Enjoy the roof terrace with a view of the snow-covered Atlas Mountains in the distance.    The location is close to the Badii Palace the Saadian tombs and the bizarrely interesting Djemaa El Fna square with all the hustle and bustle of the souk outside the door.

Riad Dar Anika,Alison B wrote a review Feb 2014,50,unbelievably good service,"it shows the power of trip advisor as we wouldn't have known about this hotel without trip advisor but It really is as good as everyone says it is. The hotel was an oasis of peace with service that royalty maybe used to but I have certainly never experienced anything like it. From the minute you step out of the bustle of the streets through their large Arabic door they greeted us with drinks and asked us what we would like to do over the weekend.

Riad Dar Anika,Richard M wrote a review Feb 2014,50,Perfect in every way!,I highly recommend this Riad as probably the best place to stay in Marrakech. The location is very convenient and it is definitely more fun to stay inside the Medina than to stay in one of the soulless hotels outside the ancient city. It is a stone's throw from the marketplace. The Riad has been beautifully converted and the rooms although not luxurious are spacious very clean and beautifully decorated. The staff are very attentive and knowledgeable and everyone is very cheerful which really makes a place for me. Dinner was exceptional and the staff's attentiveness only added to the pleasure of dining in house. Breakfast was good quality and everything was freshly made from the bread to the orange juice. The little touches are there in abundance from the gracious way requests are dealt with to a surprise pack lunch just before our departure really made Dar Anika a gem. The guide and driver recommended to us were also excellent and we felt very comfortable with them. All in all a great experience. Many thanks Sameer and staff.,Date of stay: January 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vbm6

Riad Dar Anika,BertieSJG wrote a review Jan 2014,50,Like a mini palace,Exceptionally helpful and friendly staff who couldn't have done more for us during our stay. The delicious breakfast was served at a time of our choosing by the gorgeous court yard pool. The rooms were exquisite. We never had to worry about getting a cab as the staff always ensured transport was organised. The staff even organised to look after our luggage for a few days when we went to the coast. Really nothing was too much. Was simply amazing.

Riad Dar Anika,flyandcharles wrote a review Jan 2014,50,Great break,We were here from 28 December leaving on 1 January    Pick up from airport efficient with a lovely welcome on our arrival at Anika which is very much hidden from the street the large wooden doors being set in a little alley off the beginning of the Medina.    Our deluxe room was on the ground floor directly opposite the courtyard/public area (think room10). Lovely room with four poster vanity unit and spacey showerroom. Only window was a pretty stained glass one overlooking the public area. We were shown a window cushion to lessen any noise from outside. This did work but there was a feeling of lack of privacy with this room and more than once other guests congregated outside the door not helped by seating!    After 2 nights we enquired whether another room was available and were delighted to be shown upstairs to room 3 which was an upgrade.    All was well until we discovered the air conditioning was not working just as we were going out. They attended to it immediately and we were told it was fixed . However on our return much later in the evening we discovered it was only blowing hot air. I should point out I am of a certain age and get very hot so need a really cool room. By 11.30pm it had not been resolved so they had to put us in another room so after moving all our belongings we did not get a good nights sleep.    The following day the owner took up the issue and kindly bought me a fan so we could return to room 3 for our final night. I think everybody looked at the a/c unit but finally concluded it was broken!    Now you might think this is a complaint about Anika! but far from it. We asked to be moved from an acceptable room and things break down but the owner and staff at Anika bent over backwards to help us in addition to their genuine care about their guests stay and enjoyment of Marrakech.    They also made our last night (NYE) very special by Laying a table on the roof terrace under the Bedouin tent for our dinner which was probably an inconvenience as they had a special night for hotel guests with entertainment which was on the ground floor!    Would be go back to Anika? If we return to Marrakech yes most certainly but upstairs!,Date of stay: December 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,norfolk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flyandcharles

Riad Dar Anika,DookieDevon wrote a review Jan 2014,40,lovely riad,This is a lovely Riad and the rooms are very nice. The sitting room downstairs with the sofas and fire is great. Service was very good the staff friendly and food is nice. The terrace upstairs is lovely and we enjoyed sitting out there in January in the sun (28 degrees at one time). My only critique was the level of noise at times from other guests who would sit outside my room (once at 4.30am in the morning) talking - this woke me up a few times and I had to mention it to them. The Riad is very central - a 5 minute walk to the main square. It is easy to find and the taxi takes you almost to the front door.

Riad Dar Anika,Only one bing wrote a review Jan 2014,50,Please read my review,My wife and I have stayed in many 5* accommodations around the world but the staff at Dar Anika are like no other we have ever experienced. from the moment you arrive you are made to feel part of the family.    The Riad itself is in an amazing location as you are right in the heart of the action not to mention the beautiful traditional Moroccan décor which is complimented by the staff's attention to detail and cleanliness.    Now for the exceptional part..    My wife is 20 weeks pregnant and at 23.30 on new years eve she began to lose amniotic fluid and had asked me to get her to the hospital. Within 10 minutes we was on our way to the hospital where the languages spoken are French and Arabic however the taxi driver (Mohammed) was asked by the Samir (manager at Dar Anika) to stay with us and to make sure we was ok this is exactly what he did. He translated and made sure that we was getting the care we needed staying with us until 1.30 in the morning when I finally managed to get him to go home. This was not before he had gone back to the riad to get us both clothes from our room along with drink and snacks.    The next day I called the riad to organise a taxi for me to come back to get some more clothes etc of which within 10 minutes we had a visit from Abu the owner of Dar Anika who had come on his bike to visit us to see how my wife was. He asked if we needed anything that we had just to ask. On my return to the hospital the staff at Dar Anika had prepared some food to take back along with more drink and fruit.    Thankfully that evening my wife was discharged and we was greeted by Mohammed who again translated the results and scans and then helped to get the medicines from the pharmacy and then taking us back to the riad. upon our arrival the staff where all present to see how my wife was. We was asked if we would like dinner in our room due to my wife being told strict bed rest from which we just assumed we would be eating on a tray etc but we was greeted by two waiters who bought in a table and dressed it like the restaurant even going as far as to bring the wine glasses and stabilizing the leg to stop the table wobbling!!!    This continued to the next day where we was still on strict bed rest but was put up in the guest lounge and served breakfast then lunch. We was then greeted with a basket of flowers from Abu who again had come in to see how my wife was again saying anything that we need please just ask. again that night we had dinner served in our room.    The final day we had to go and collect our notes from the hospital from which Abu himself took me in a taxi to the hospital where they had unfortunately misplaced the notes but after an hour of Abu speaking to several nurses and doctors they located them and prepared our copy along with the certificate to fly home. upon leaving the riad we was greeted by staff wishing us all the best and was yet again given more food for the journey home.    Words cannot describe the emotions we went through but the staff as Dar Anika where simply second to none. Without them we would have endured a nightmare trip to Marrakech.    Thank you Abu Samir and team we shall return with the baby.

We were treated like royalty at Dar Anika from the moment we walked in the door. We had told them that we were visiting for our honeymoon and our suite was covered in rose petals. The entire staff was committed to making sure that our experience was nothing short of FANTASTIC. The highlight of our trip was the New Years Eve celebration at the riad. Not only had the staff lined up an array of great bands belly dancers and singers but the entire staff seemed to genuinely enjoy celebrating and dancing the night away with us. Aside from being a great host and helping us plan out our days with attention to all the details Abu was an awesome Dj and Samir not only made sure we were taken care of during the stay and provided five star service but he also made sure the dance party kept going. :) We had such a fantastic time and really appreciated how the staff all went above and beyond.,Date of stay: December 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Los Angeles, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nclaudat

While we stayed in a very authentic Riad (Riad Dar Anika) on the edge of the Medina where the staff were excellent and attentive and clearly anxious to ensure we were well looked after our room was tiny and cramped mostly occupied by a traditional poster double bed and one upright chair and one reading light and certainly did not meet the description on the website of being ""a double room and seating area.""  The local souks and large market square were bustling and interesting but being perstered on all sides by sellers and beggars did not help. A day trip to the nearby Atlas Mountains was very interesting but the tombs are vastly over rated.  Should have booked for 2-3 days not 5.

Riad Dar Anika,Amit P wrote a review Nov 2013,50,Amazing Honey moon location,We had our honeymoon in Marrakech and luckily for us we stayed at Dar Anika. As soon as we walked inside the Riad we were amazed with the authentic look and warm surroundings. On arrival to our room there were flowers and rose petals laid out on the bed which definitely gave me some brownie points with my new wife. We had booked a meal that night in the Riad in which we were given our own private area for dining and the staff pulled out all the stops to make a very romantic setting. After our first nights stay we were greeted in the morning by Abu the hotel manager who provided us a map and advised us of activities and where to eat as well as giving excellent advice on do's and dont's which proved invaluable. My wife found the bed slightly hard and they sorted this problem immediately (I on the other hand like the matress). An absolute must is to take advantage of the massage and hammam services the Riad offers in which we went twice. There is a heated indoor swimming pool which unfortunately we only used once and directly opposite there is a living space with TV which we unfortunately did not have time to make use of but really is a truly amazing space to read or watch TV. The Riads location is prime everything is walking distance and as soon as you walk out onto the street you can embrace the hustle and bustle of Marrakech. On our last day our flight was not until 6:20pm and they kindly allowed us to stay in our room until we needed to leave for the airport. Lastly to our delight when we left they provided a free taxi to the airport and a packed lunch.

Riad Dar Anika,Hebe_Bear wrote a review Nov 2013,50,We were charmed,This was a very special place. We couldn’t recommend it highly enough. We travelled as a family with children aged 7/10/13. The location within the Medina is perfect for all the key places to visit. Most are a 10 minute walk. Inside the atmostphere is serene the rooms are very well appointed and the peace away from the hubub is not to be underrated! But the greatest plaudits belong to Abu and his staff. As first time travellers to Marrakesh this made the experience a greatly enjoyable one for all of us. Nothing was too much trouble. He confidently helped us how to plan each day. How long visits would take when to take breaks suggestions to eat/shop and most importantly how to haggle! (Divide by 6 and end up about 50% higher than that). They arranged a Hamman at the hotel warmed up the pool for our three children organised a private dinnner on the roof. The roof terrace was a great place for our children. There is a small turrent in one turret in one corner and they loved watching the husstle and bustle of the street life below them away from the noise dirt and heat which one can have enough of. The roof terrace is also where one has the most beautiful breakfasts in the morning sun. And whilst Dar Anika is not a large place its is nevertheless higher than most building around affording beautiful views especially in the evening sunset.  Any downsides? The Riad is close to a Mosque so the call to morning prayer can be rather early and may disturb lighte sleepers. Rooms 1 and 2 are furthest away. DO NOT let it prevent you staying here would be my advice.  For what its worth we travelled on to the palatial and vastly more expensive Kasbaah Tamadot which was another experience. But on balance we decided that we all preferred Dar Anika.

Riad Dar Anika,jonspeyer wrote a review Nov 2013,50,An Oasis of Calm Amongst The Chaos,Words are not enough to describe the transition of feelings as you enter the Riad from the street. When the taxi dropped us off we thought he had us in the wrong place. Trepidation was the overwhelming feeling as we navigated our way past the donkey pulling carts and ladies sitting outside selling gold bracelets. The door swings open and you are greeted with warm smiles and a wondrous smell. The atmosphere inside is the reverse of outside and that makes it an ideal place to rest after a day spent haggling with a market trader over the cost of a chopping board or spending 3 hours being marched round the medina by Ali who decides that we need his personal attention ( costing 100 DH obviously ).The food that was served on my birthday evening was possibly the best I have ever eaten and the way the staff looked after us and our baby Sophia was impeccable. Nothing was too much trouble. They even produced a birthday cake and sang happy birthday to Jow on the roof terrace . You would not get that at a Best Western.

The riad is perfectly located for nearly all the popular tourist sights all within 10-15 mins walk away. We were greeted with mint tea fresh pastries and fruit on arrival and then were given an introduction by Abu about the various sights etc. as well as valuable tips on getting around what to be careful of and a map. The rooms were well furnished and equipped absolutely pristinely clean as was the rest of the riad. Breakfast was served on the balcony fresh fruit homemade delicious yoghurt cakes breads and pastries. All cooked fresh and served warm. We ate dinner in the riad on one evening and I can only describe it as a banquet! Fresh local food home made and lots of it!!! In fact it was the best food we had in marrakesh. The service throughout our stay was excellent very personal without being intrusive. Tea coffee and cakes served on return at the end of a day sightseeing was a real treat. Whilst outside the riad all around was very noisy it was very quiet and calming as soon as you entered.

Riad Dar Anika,Sam T wrote a review Nov 2013,50,Honeymoon Heaven,Dar Anika is a gem. My husband and I spent five of seven nights of our honeymoon here and were treated with the utmost care and kindness. As a case in point our first breakfast – already amazing given the wonderful selection of food (oh the yoghurt!) and the charm of the roof terrace – was further enhanced as the Dar Anika staff presented us with a delicious personalised ‘honeymoon’ cake.    The hotel from top to bottom – including each individual hotel room – is gorgeous and designed with care and the staff reflect this precision; they are kind diligent and proactive and they aim to please. The managers are accessible and approachable and make time to ensure you are equipped with the best tips (i.e. where to eat staying safe) before you head out into the hubbub of the Marrakech souks and streets.    Its location is also brilliant. A five minute walk can land you at the main square (Fna) to the north or the Badi Palace to the south. A 10-15 minute taxi ride can get you into the ‘new town’ as well if you’re seeking a different kind of meal or nightlife or if you need to get to the bus or train station.

Riad Dar Anika,Nick S wrote a review Oct 2013,50,What a great experience,I thought long and hard about the rating could I really consider it as being excellent? The answer had to be a resounding yes with the caveat - for the price. If you can afford the £470 per night La Mamounia then you might not consider Dar Anika as excellent. However for us it was great. The location right on the edge of the Madina is good close enough to experience the bussle far enough away to feel comfortable. We enjoyed the Hammam the breakfast and the decor. The staff were really helpful and the size of the room great with ample storage and a great bathroom. The whole environment was cool and calm - a complete contrast to the world outside!  We found the bed to be a little harder than we're used to - I acknowledge that comfort is such a subjective thing! However this issue was quickly remedied by the staff through the addition of an additional layer of bedding.  If you’re flying in to Marrakech make use of Dar Anika's airport pick up and drop off service - it was really good.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Swansea, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/56NickS

Since our arrival at this riad everything was perfect Samir is excellent with his enthusiastic way of treat people like others reviews we had a welcome tea cakes a lot of information about the city and what to do. Everyday we enjoy staying in this place if you need a massage city tour walking tour guides driver special dinner advices etc...even one night Samir came with us to make sure we will be at one place my wife select for dinner (was at Medina little street and late hours). Roof terrace for breakfast with one of the best orange juice I ever had (we used to live in Brazil and Miami) and we know about oranges.

It is in an easy to find location on a main street with beautiful rooms staff and facilities. Many of the riads we had researched were in hard to find small side streets so we were very happy to find a Riad that was so easy to locate. The staff were eager to please and offered good advice on holidaying in Marrakesh.  The airport transfers and rooftop terrace were a great addition.

Riad Dar Anika,DrWolff wrote a review Sep 2013,50,An oasis of luxury and charm,We booked a superior/de luxe room here for a three day break for two. What a find this is! We are not prone to effusive or overenthusiastic reviews but here is one to redress the balance. It would be hard to criticise this riad in the old city. The organisation the welcome the service throughout our stay were fantastic. We were pampered beyond our expectations - we would definitely recommend the hammam followed by a massage as a way of relaxing after a day of travelling. That put us in the mood for a delicious traditional Moroccan dinner which was certainly one of the best meals we had during our stay. Breakfasts were also excellent and food plentiful.  The riad itself is small with only 12 rooms only half of which were occupied. It is a very comfortable and intimate place to spend a few days. The welcome included tea cakes rose petals spread everywhere fruit & complimentary drinks in the room a chat with the owner (including helpful tourist tips restaurant reservations etc). Biscuits and nibbles were put in the room daily. Service from the entire staff was always courteous unintrusive and delivered with grace and a smile.  Standards of cleanliness were incredibly high - it was spotless - and it is in excellent decorative order.  For a romantic weekend this absolutely ticks all the boxes. Worth every penny. We would definitely stay here again.,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cadiz, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrWolff

Having travelled in Morocco before and having sampled some great Riads in Marrakech this is definitely the best yet! The service and hospitality was great. They were welcoming without being pushy or over the top. It's a beautiful Riad on the outskirts of the Medina so easily accessable by taxi. There is a great bar just across the road and the Jemaa el Fna is about 5 minutes walk away. Breakfast on the terrace was peaceful and absolutely delicious! They even sent us off with a packed lunch for our journey to Essaouira.

It was indeed the best way to start our trip with this riad full of nice decoration details and our room was amazing with a small patio just for the two of us. The service is simply incredible all the people at the riad make you feel welcome and they are very helpful for every little thing that you need from restaurant recommendations and bookings to having your laundry done. Breakfast was served at the terrace and it was great.

We were warmly welcomed with refreshments and a very helpful briefing by the manager Samia with particular reference to our safety (we were two women travelling alone). He even gave us his personal mobile number. The room was cool comfortable and spacious and was kept very clean and tidy. Breakfast was extensive served on the roof terrace with the riad's two resident tortoises. The waiter remembered our orders and preferences throughout the stay and all of the staff from the manager to the cleaners were smiley and helpful. This was particularly appreciated when my sister fell ill in the middle of our trip. The staff helped me to cancel/ reschedule reservations for spas and excursions we had made taking pains to retain the deposits I had paid wherever possible. They also brought us lunch in our room despite usually only serving lunch and dinner with 24 hours notice and then didn't charge us for any of it at the end of our stay.

Riad Dar Anika,Florence C wrote a review Aug 2013,50,You never know what's behind closed doors!,Wow! What a beautiful place. The drive to Anika didn't suggest we'd be met with such opulence when we arrived. We had the traditional mint tea by the lovely pool before being shown our gorgeous rooms. We were upgraded to a lovely four poster - very spacious cool and clean : we found the air con v effective! A huge comfy bed was most welcome after a tiring day negotiating the souks. Breakfast was fine. We had lunch a couple of times - it was okay but 1) nothing special and 2) expensive. It's quicker to walk to the square rather than taking a cab but it's not a scenic route (!) and a little unnerving so ask the hotel for a guide..at least for part of the way. The square is amazing at night and a real experience. Try the food stalls - we survived! Number 75 was excellent. The riad was a welcome oasis in the madness!

Riad Dar Anika,Conor F wrote a review Aug 2013,50,Honeymoon - 1st time in Marrakesh from Ireland,We stayed with Abou in Riad dar Anika in January of this year for a week on our honeymoon.  It was our first time in Morocco travelling from Ireland.  On first arrival in Marrakesh it looks like a daunting city but the warm welcome from Abou and his staff (and tortoise called couscous) made us feel right at home :)  We were brought into the beautiful Riad from a busy street and greeted with pastries mint tea and milk.  Once we had relaxed after our travelling we were invited onto the lovely roof terrace that has full views of the old town were Abou spent an hour with us giving us our bearings around the city with a map and drawing points of interest and telling us the do's and don’ts.  On arriving in the city we were sure we would hire a guide to show us around but after the hour with Abou he had put our minds at rest and we felt happy to venture out by ourselves.  Abou pretty much organised our entire week for us booking restaurants and show’s -without him we would not have seen a quarter of the things we did and would have fallen into the usual tourist routines and traps.  The Riad is a beautifully decorated in a traditional manner and is a calming spot in the middle of a bustling city the staff could not do more to make you feel welcome.  Fresh flowers in the room and rose petals on our bed!!  The food is unreal - just be aware that there is so much of you will probably put on a few pounds!!  Traditional Moroccan breakfast is served on the beautiful roof terrace - this is a real treat.  The Raid is a real gem in the heart of the old town in Marrakesh and Abou and his staff honestly could not do more to welcome you to the beautiful Riad and their city.

Riad Dar Anika,Manning W wrote a review Jun 2013,50,Oasis in the Medina,During our family's four-day stay in Marrakech the boutique hotelDar Anika was our oasis in the medina. The hotel's driver picked us up promptly on our arrival. Our suite there was large and comfortable with A/C WiFi and fresh roses. Fresh fruit water and mint tea was continually replenished. Our breakfast each morning on the rooftop terrace was simply wonderful with freshly-squeezed orange juice omelettes English muffins French crepes and a continually changing array of fresh pastries. The owner-manager Abu personally designed our tours providing guides and drivers for our time in the souks for camel rides in the Palmerie for our carriage ride (calech) around the old city walls and our visit to Essaouria and its Atlantic beach. The riad's highly trained staff especially Fadwa Laila and Rachid could not have been more thoughtful gracious and attentive. On our departure the staff even prepared sandwiches and fruit for our return flight to Barcelona thoughtfully aware that we would be arriving too late for dinner there. We will definitely return for another stay at Dar Anika and may accept Abu's offer to make arrangements for a three-day excursion to the deserts of Morocco.,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Barcelona, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ManningW

It's busy 18 hours a day/night with people donkeys pulling carts and mopeds coming at you from all angles but a place to visit on your must visit list. We stayed at the Dar Anika which is ideally situated for visiting all sites of interest. It is a 5 minute walk to the Medina and Souks. The staff at Dar Anika are so nice and can't do enough for you. On our arrival we were met by the owner who spent an hour with us drinking mint tea with various pastries and advising us with a map where to go and what to avoid. We were then shown to our room with a large 4 poster decorated with red rose petals. The bathroom also with rose petals was really nice no bath but a really good shower. Meals taken up on the roof were superb and the views excellent. You can walk the whole city but be prepared to get lost because you will even with a map. Just go into a shop and the guy behind the counter will put you right. Don't ask anyone else They will offer to help you and you end up at a 'friends' and get the big sell. We were there for 3 full exciting days. If we had booked 4 we could have done the mountains so we'll go back to Anika in a couple of years and do just that.

Our room was spacious and clean. The common areas were well appointed and there was always someone around to attend to our needs. The walk to the souks is easy and yet it is on the edge of all the chaos - which makes for the perfect place to retreat after a long day sight-seeing and bargaining. We've stayed at 5 star hotels around the globe and have to say that the staff here is on the same par. We wanted for nothing. Abu and Samir were extremely accommodating and gave us one-on-one attention in order to see what ways they could help make our vacation memorable.

Riad Dar Anika,MSSI wrote a review May 2013,50,Home away from home!,My husband stayed 3 nts and had a wonderful experience. We were treated like honored guests in a friend's house. All the staff were very professional warm and friendly. They made sure our stay was as comfortable and pleasant as they could make it. Reservations were easy to make and we were met at the airport so we did not have to worry about finding the Riad. The location is perfect just off the main road and close to the market square and some of the key tourist sites. Once inside the riad you really don't hear noises from the outside. The indoor atrium living room balcony areas and the rooftop terrace were all nicely set up with comfortable areas to sit lounge read etc.  We chose room #2 which we believe is their largest room. It had a king size bed and a dome with little glass covered holes so at night you can look up from the bed and it looks like you are looking at stars; during the day it lets additional light into the room. When we first got to the room they had rose petals strewn about which we thought was very romantic. There is no bath tub so we had to get used to the open shower which is very common in Europe just have to accept that water will splash around not really an issue.  Had dinner at the riad our 1st nt. We ate at two other places the other nights and we have to say that the food at Dar Anika was equally good and the service the best! There was a really cool nomad tent up on the rooftop terrace and that's where they had set up our dinner. The food kept coming and it was delicious! The presentation of the different dishes was very well done like being in a Michelin starred restaurant. And service during dinner was impeccable.  Breakfasts were feasts! They have the best ever homemade yogurt which my husband loved. When you come back from sightseeing or shopping someone is always ready to get you some tea and cakes. We also got a nice picnic lunch on our departure day. On top of it all the staff brought flowers and a birthday cake for my husband while we were having breakfast one day since we were there for his birthday. They sang happy birthday twice including one in the traditional Moroccan way! We were very touched.  Our stay really was one of the most enjoyable we've had in our travels. If we are ever back in Marrakech will definitely stay at Riad Dar Anika again!

Riad Dar Anika,Serena S wrote a review May 2013,50,"Mystical, Magical, Memorable.",I wasn't sure what to expect when visiting Marrakech as I hadn't really heard of anyones experiences before hand. Upon arriving to Dar Anika the hustle bustle that surrounded the Riad was close to my expectation however after entering the Riad it was as if I was transported to a fairytale land somewhat resembling Aladdin. The welcome that I recieved from the staff added to my fairytale making me feel like Princess Jasmine.    The Riad itself was beautiful and the attention to detail in the décor was truly magical. The rooms were comfortable and no televisions truly enhanced the feel of a traditional Riad. The terrace where breakfast was served was an experience in its own. It was wonderful to sit and watch over the Medina and all that was happening outside whilst being in an environment so serene.    Breakfast was lovely with an orange juice coffee fruit salad yoghurt and cake every morning as well as almost anything you request. The staff were kind and attentive constantly ensuring that my stay was comfortable and whatever I needed was available to me right away.    All in all I would rate Dar Anika 10 out of 10. For anyone looking for a relaxing holiday or one with a true feel of Marrakech Dar Anika would be the ideal place to stay as alll your needs will be met and all your expectations will be exceeded.    This place was truly mystical magical and memorable.,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/serenas727

In what has been one of our nicest stays on our travels in Morocco.    The hotel is well located a short 5 min walk from main square giving you some peace and tranquility but with all the convenience that you need in the city.    Recommendations were excellent pool was cooling and breakfast roof terraced delight. We were also surprised and touched at the snack provided for us for our flight home.

Riad Dar Anika,jseethram wrote a review May 2013,50,Incredible service and comfort in the heart of the medina,I have travelled a fair amount for both business and pleasure. Dar Anika was our final stay in Morocco. I can honestly say that the service at this riad was the best I've ever experienced in over 30 years of travelling beating out even 5star hotel chains. From the riad's owner to the manager to the service staff all were willing to do anything it took to make our stay comfortable. This included providing us espressos in the morning from a coffee shop across the street to buying is kilos of spices from their own supplier for fear that we'd be taken by unscrupulous vendors in the souks. We had an incredible multi-course meal at the riad that trumped any other Moroccan fair during our 10 days in country. The rooms were small but comfortable. The riad was an oasis.,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Edmonton, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jseethram
Riad Dar Anika,Elizabeth Williams wrote a review May 2013,50,Fabulous Dar Anika,We only decided to go to Marrakech two days prior to our departure it was a very last minute decision. We chose Dar Anika on the reviews we read on Trip Advisor as they were excellent. This is a 12 bedroomed traditional style Moroccan mansion. The rooms are arranged around a court yard and the accommodation is traditional comfortable but not luxurious. We were highly delighted by the hotel. The staff are very attentive but not overbearing. The first morning there we were greeted by the manager Samir who greeted us with great pleasure. He marked up a map of the city showing places of interest good places to eat and lively night spots! Such detail to attention was exemplary. We could not fault the service it was just wonderful.  Later we met the owner Abu who was equally attentive and gave great insight in to where to go and what to avoid. The breakfast was very good and held on the roof terrace look out for the storks! Remember to have lunch or dinner the food is first class cooked to perfection. Thank you for the birthday cake and flowers that were given to my husband for his birthday and all the staff signing happy birthday. A very memorable holiday staying at Dar Anika thank you everyone.,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/589ElizabethW589

Riad Dar Anika,embryo123 wrote a review May 2013,50,The Absolutely Perfect Place to Stay in Marrakech!,The Riad Dar Anika is one of the best places we have ever stayed at in all of our travels.  The Riad is absolutely beautiful. It has a gorgeous entry with a swimming pool in the middle of the courtyard. The place is exceptionally clean to the highest of standards. We stayed in Room #1 (it is spectacular and spacious highly recommend it) and our kids stayed in Room #2 (Very large room with plenty of sleeping capacity)  The people who work there are very friendly and attentive without being overbearing and hovering. The are ready to provide you with advice on the logistics of getting around and things to do.  The restaurant is fabulous. One must have dinner there at least once during the stay. My wife and sister-in-law took a cooking class with the head chef. They learned how to make tangia and tangine. I am still reaping the benefits to that cooking class!!  The breakfast in the morning is wonderful. They would ask us around what time we would like to eat and a table would be ready for our entire group already set up with fresh squeezed orange juice fruit salad pastries and other freshly made items. It was really great because we could quickly eat and get out about our day.  The hotel is in a short walk to the main market in Marrakech. We walked with our 4 kids to the main historic sites in Marrakech using the Riad Anika as our home base.  When we go back to Marrakech we will definitely be staying at the Hotel Anika again. Everyone in our family had a great time in Morocco and the experience as a whole was enhanced by the wonderful places we stayed at such as the Riad Anika.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/embryo123

Riad Dar Anika,Dominique S wrote a review Apr 2013,50,Book here!,Just returned from 5 days in Marrakech at the sumptuous and delightful Dar Anika. I read the reviews before I booked was impressed and then doubly so when I stayed. An oasis in the midst of chaos. You have to decide if you want to be in town or just out of town in 'hotel land'. If you choose the former for a more authentic Marrakech feel then you will find unparalleled service and attention to detail at this Riad. I can not fathom how any Riad could better them. The location to is so central you can walk on foot everywhere. The rooms are spotless and the staff - well they are the little gem that make it uber special.    Hats off! This place is worth the money and worth your visiting. Just don't step on that little turtle down by the pool or pop her in your suitcase to come home. Everyone else describes this place in more detail than me and I concur with their accounts.

Riad Dar Anika,Donut wrote a review Apr 2013,50,The best service we have ever had - amazing!,"Just back from a fabulous stay at the Dar Anika - it and Marrakech exceded our expectations in every way.  They pre arranged a car to meet us at the airport and effortlessly whisk us to the hotel. The door is a simple door - but then inside - an incredible moorish decor just oozing care and quality.    We were shown to our room of good size with a large bathroom decorated in the same vein with rose petals strewn thoughout. All spotlessly clean.    And then up onto the roof for an amazing Morroccan dinner - and Morrocan wine - they have a very good Morrocan wine list.    So all very good so far - then you get up the next morning and after a sumptous breakfast again on the roof. They hit you with their secret weapon - service.    We were given a map and they sat down with us and explained where to go what to see how to get there what a caleche/ taxi would cost for this route etc. (it kills the haggling when you go -""hotel says it's this much"" - price comes straight down.  As for restaurants they just booked them arranged a driver and that was all there was to it. By the way you give the restaurant the driver's card when you are finished and he comes and takes you back.    All of this service is very discrete and in in no way pushy - they are are just there to help you have a great time. We had a truly effortless break - The team just organised everything quietly and efficiently for us.    The location is very good - it is just a straight line walk (say 5mins) to Jamaa Al Fna Square - you can't get lost and it felt safe walking back at 11.30 pm plus.    On top of this we had the Hamman and Massage in the hotel's facilities - very good and relaxing I was falling asleep over dinner that night. Finally they arranged a car to take us back to the airport.    This was probably the most relaxing holiday we have ever had - all down to the efforts of the Dar Anika team - thank you.",Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Cambridge UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Donut9061
Riad Dar Anika,GusinLondon wrote a review Apr 2013,50,Hospitality doesn't get better than this: our family trip to Morocco part 2,Tucked away round a corner so very easy to miss when the large wooden doors swung open it was like entering the Tardis. Stunning interiors a delightful welcome beautiful and decorous fabulous rose-petalled bedrooms breakfasts on the terrace the small but welcome pool and of course the three tortoises (large medium and cute). But what sets this Riad apart is the service - attentive friendly perfect.    We spent 2 nights here with our two 11 year olds following 5 nights at Kasbah Angour near the Atlas Mountains (see part 1 review). Abu was our main host here and his tips on what to do and when and where to eat were great. When we ate at Pepe Nero on the first night it was a beautiful setting complimented by very good cuisine (they have Moroccan and Italian menus). (btw walking to the restaurant some cheeky gent told us it was closed - no doubt trying to win custom for another place - luckily we had reservations so didn't fall for it).    However Abu's second recommendation on our last night was sublime - Dar Rizlane was beyond exquisite: the gardens the food the service were amongst the best I have experienced anywhere. It cost a lot - around £150? - but as near to perfect as a meal in Marrakech can be.    Marrakech was very hot this week 38 degrees and the assault on all the senses with the souks and the Medina square as mad and as noisy and as busy as ever may not suit everyone but it is a magical place with great exotic sights and smells at every turn. The ever present and buzzing mopeds and scooters are not welcome partners in the alleyways.    On our first afternoon there Abu recommended we ask our guide to take us direct to the souks and visit the Bahi and Saadian tombs the next day ourselves as they were very closeby. Unfortunately the guide wouldn't listen to us and it took an hour and half in very hot conditions before we finally arrived in the markets. We weren't happy with him as the souks are only about a 10 or 15 minute walk from Dar Anika but he did show us some great stalls. You have to be prepared for the way of the guides - they take you to a shop - usually a pharmacy/herbalist a carpet shop a carpenter etc where there's a medium to hard sell but on about the fourth or fifth 'no thank you' the message is received. But there is so much I'd like to buy! If you do want to buy something always offer less than half their asking price and work up a little from there. Never pay more than half their original asking price. Walk away then you will get a good price! At one stage we got drawn (via our guide) into a carpet shop tired and hot and we politely withdrew quickly before our guide had re-appeared. I suggested (only half jokingly) we make a run for it.    A guide is useful the first time there but no its not impossible to find your way round the Medina with a decent map.    Dar Anika provided a wonderful peaceful respite from the hustle and bustle and noise of Marrakech; on our last day they provided very tasty lunch bags to take to the airport with us.    It's a fabulous place and just doesn't get better than this.,Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GusinLondon
Riad Dar Anika,Ferdie2012 wrote a review Apr 2013,50,A beautiful haven in Marrakesh,Don't be put off by the approach to the entrance this must be one of the nicest Riads in Marrakech. Welcomed with mint tea milk and dates after a while Samir greeted us and gave us a full introduction to Marrakesh including map advice and recommendation where to eat. Lovely covered courtyard with rooms off on first floor very comfortable little warm at night but we did not think it justified asking for the air con to be turned on. Great evening meal lots of elements whole tableful of dishes. Breakfast with eggs served on roof. Attentive service we could have benefited from better French as some things weren't clear to us when Samir was not there but the staff could not be more helpful including sending us off with lunch on last day.

Riad Dar Anika,Anne M wrote a review Apr 2013,50,Beautiful hotel - fantastic food and great staff!,We spent 5 days at the Riad dar Anika. What a beautiful hotel! And the staff was simply fantastic!  Arrival:  We got picked up in a lovely car from the airport and driven straight to the hotel. There we were welcomed and sent up to the roof terrace straight away for a complimentary breakfast as we arrived in Marrakech at 9am.  Food:  The food was great - delicious yoghurt fruit salad fresh orange juice coffee tea break a different cake every day and an omelette. We had dinner at the dar Anika as well one night. The setting was fantastic on the rooftop the food was truly outstanding but maybe just as good as the food was the service – we loved witnessing how proud the staff was to introduce us to the delights of the Moroccan cuisine which was lovely.  Staff:  Every staff member was extremely helpful and courteous always there to help you in any way by making recommendations upon request. Tea and Moroccan soups were offered to us throughout our stay. Fantastic staff management and owner – I’d definitely come back to stay at the dar Anika!  Rooms:  Beautiful rooms! Decorated in deep colours and quality accessories – from handstitched bedspreads to gorgeous pillows and quality shampoo.  Pool:  I was looking for a hotel with a pool but booked the dar Anika despite its moderate 4-meter pool. When I arrived I learned that due to architectural reasons there are actually very few pools in the city. The small pool at dar Anika is perfectly fine to get refreshed and you can go on a trip to one of the beautiful spas for a swim or a Hammam if you like. I recommend the massage at the Golf Atlas hotel outside of the city walls.    If you book the dar Anika I am sure you will have a beautiful stay – suitable for children and couples alike. A great small hotel!    My thanks go to Samir and all the staff  Anne,Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Ripon, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnneM562
Riad Dar Anika,AtaB_13 wrote a review Apr 2013,50,"Dar Anika, our Marrakech experience",It started with a short drive from Marrakech airport to the old city Medina at the beginning of a busy street Zaitoun El Kadiem (Old Olive Street) at the entrance of the old Souk (market) leading to Djemma el Fna.  Not knowing what to expect except some photos we saw of the Riad (Boutique Hotel) in the Internet we were directed to an old beautifully carved door the moment it was opened we were greeted by Abu Omar and Khalid part of the hotel management we knew that we were into an experience.  At the entrance there was a small reception area handled by two pleasant ladies directly to an amazing courtyard with a massive skylight extending to the upper parameters of the yard during the winter times it is covered with a transparent membrane during the summer the membrane is removed totally at all times light always comes through. The main structure of the building overlooks into the yard to the right there is a swimming pool directly straight the hammam to the left a sitting room some guest rooms on the ground floor and the rest on the first floor in total 12 guest rooms all with views on the yard on the second floor there is the roof terrace beautifully landscaped focus point Arabian tent potted plants trees and flowers with views over the old city and Atlas mountain. All floors are furnished in a traditional period style with the influence of mature plantations. In addition to the hotel staff furniture fixtures and fittings there are two tortoises a chameleon and a stuffed toy monkey on a palm all permanent occupants.  Once inside the Riad strangely the noises of the busy streets disappeared our luggage were taken immediately to our room politely we were asked to leave our passports for registration and then taken through the main courtyard of the hotel to a beautifully decorated sitting room with the traditional old style of the Riad  we were offered wet towels to freshen up followed by some traditional soup dates Moroccan tea and local sweets all prepared on the premises followed by a brief introduction to the hotel and the city. Going up to our room we were faced with an amazing internally decorated and finished room red rose petals were used to enhance the decoration there were complimentary fruits water and nuts. Although the Riad is of old construction it has been modernized to a very good standard which is very evident in the rooms and the bathroom facilities.  Our complimentary breakfast we used to have it daily on the roof terrace with some guests already finished soaking in the sun with a book some coming to have breakfast. Afternoon tea is offered daily with dinner normally served with local dishes in the courtyard some nights there will be local musician playing traditional music to accompany the food and wine. We must say dining in the Riad is an experience and is a must so is the hammam translated bathroom but it is a way of bathing in the old traditional way.  Leaving the Riad to visit the Souk local attractions and excursions it was always nice to come back to the Riad as a retreat looking forward to a clean room shower a glass of wine to relax and to embark into the evening. It is almost like an oasis in the middle of the desert.    In total we stayed eight nights we were sad to leave the service we received the attention to our needs and to small details the readiness of the staff to help and please all was beyond our expectations Dar Anika is a boutique hotel with a massive big heart for sure we will visit again.  Thank you to the management and all the staff to have made our stay memorable one.

We were efficiently collected from the airport and brought to the door of the Riad. From that moment we received the most outstanding service imaginable: we were greeted in person and offered refreshments to relax. We were allowed to drop our bags early in the room where we discovered the most beautifully adorned room decorated with rose petals and with a stunning basket of roses to celebrate our daughter's birthday that day. We went off on a guided tour of the Medina arranged previously through the Riad and returned for evening dinner. The dinner was a wonderful experience tasting so many different specialities; so much was provided that we didn't come close to eating everything on our table. To cap off a perfect evening a cake had been arranged by the Riad for our daughter. The following morning a generous breakfast was the icing on the cake.

Riad Dar Anika,David Baker wrote a review Mar 2013,50,Luxury in Marrakesh with Care for your Comfort,"We arrived in Marrakesh airport to be met by a driver from the Dar Anika who helped with bags and took us through the chaotic traffic of Marrakesh to the calm and beauty of this exotic Riad. After a welcoming mint tea we were shown to rose petal covered rooms by smiling staff. The hassle of the journey evapourated in the scents of shower.  An extensive dinner followed with several gently spiced courses appearing under the tagines. We had arrived in some sort of exotic heaven ! Candles floated on the surface of the swimming pool a muiscian played in the corner but suddenly tranquillity was interrupted by drumming and singing as three ladies appeared to demonstrate their quivering hips ! Soon peace returned and we retired to the comfortable bedrooms their Moorish designs.  Breakfast was on the roof surrounded by flowers in ""ali baba"" pots. Delicious pancakes and local bread accompanied eggs of your choice a subtle yoghourt fruit juice - in fact almost anything one could wish for.  The next three days were spent on a desert Safari organised by Abu the owner of Dar Anika. All went like clockwork thanks to excellent planning by Abu and his team. Back again in the comfort of the hotel we found out about the delights of Marrakesh Medina; everything is close by: the Bahia Palace the Jemaa El-Fna carriages to take you round the city restaurants recommended by Abu and the fascinating bustle of the passages filled with merchants selling all kinds of produce.  The staff are helpullness itself they produce tea whenever you return tired from your shopping. The hotel exchange rate is competitive everything is spotless the pool is cool after a hot day and we enjoyed being pampered immensely . Can I think of any negatives ?

Riad Dar Anika,Flossie C wrote a review Mar 2013,50,Exceptional!,We stayed at Dar Anika for 6 days and it was really a very enjoyable experience! Located right in the Medina itself it was an easy walk to the souk and Jemaa El-Fna where you can take in the sights and sounds of the old city. In fact the Bahia Palace and the El Badi Palace were just a stone’s throw away from the riad! The riad itself was clean and had a quiet and soothing ambience which was much needed after being out in the busy medina. The manager Samir was extremely comprehensive with information about must-see sights and good restaurants. We had excellent service all the time and every single person working in the riad was friendly and helpful. We also had dinner in the riad on the first night we were there and it was simply sumptuous! In fact it was one of the best meals we had in Marrakesh which was saying a lot since we did eat at many highly rated restaurants like Dar Rizlane (which was disappointing and overpriced!). We were in Room 2 which was nice and large but not well lit. Three other things made the room less than perfect for us: (1) the shower area was not enclosed which meant that the bathroom floor was always wet after we showered no matter how careful we were; (2) the two windows in the room opened out to some random space where people could walk about and that meant that we had to leave the windows closed all the time or we could have strangers looking right into our room; and (3) little skylights in a dome-shaped ceiling just above the bed was gorgeous until we realized that it meant we could not sleep in since the skylights allowed light into the room. The skylights were painted white but still let in quite a bit of light. So if you are the kind to sleep in Room 2 is not for you! But the drawbacks of the room did not detract from the loveliness of the staff and the wonderful service they provided at all times. Furthermore the owner of the riad Abu is wonderfully knowledgeable and enthusiastic about ensuring the best experience for his guests and now organizes trips into the desert where you could sleep under the stars! We met some guests whose itinerary was planned by Abu – three days in the desert before coming to Dar Anika for another few days – and they told us it was an amazing experience because everything from food to facilities to vehicles to guides was just exceptional. So we definitely recommend Dar Anika if you are planning to have an authentic Moroccan experience!,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Boston, Massachusetts",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FloC468
Riad Dar Anika,jack23u wrote a review Mar 2013,50,"Amazing all around, especially the service",From the moment we were picked up at the airport Samuel and his team did an amazing job of making us feel right at home in their beautiful Riad in the Medina with perfect access to the Souks and Square as well as the street for car service or taxi to anywhere you wish to go. Don't worry if you are not sure where to go because Samuel and the team will make great recommendations. We played 4 days of golf and loved it and the team planned our delivery to and from the golf courses every day and dinner each night was based upon their recommendations including a great Moroccaine meal in Dar Anika the first night. Everything was delicious and my wife and I were full for two days after that meal. The restaurants were all great recommendations and variety each night. We spent several days strolling the souks right from the Riad and contributed well to the local economy and bought some great treasures to remember our second trip to Marrakech. About half way through the week we had the pleasure to meet Abu the owner and it is clear that the warm hospitality and great service at Dar Anika comes from the top. He recommended an amazing restaurant for our last evening and sent his team to get us some of the best Moroccaine Pastries to bring home to a dear friend and some for ourselve too. The breakfasts the teas the terrace the service the family atmosphere I could go on and on just go and I assure you you will be glad you did!

Riad Dar Anika,AnnieBLichfield wrote a review Mar 2013,50,Weekend trip to Marrakech,I stayed at Riad Dar Anika from 1st to 4th March 2013 with my Daughter and two friends . We were treated with care and respect and were totally spoiled with attentive service ( not obtrusive and very professional). The staff were friendly and always willing to help and the managers were most helpful with local tips etc. and would take the time to chat to us.  The rooms we had were excellent although I would recommend room number 2 as it seemed lighter than mine (which was number 7). Both rooms were very comfortable and decorated on arrival with rose petals which was a lovely touch.  The breakfasts were fantastic with fruityoghurt pancakes. bread eggs etc. and even English tea! (Yes we also had Mint tea). We often had tea on the roof terrace after a day of sightseeing which was most welcome and a restful spot.  We were also given a packed lunch with a small gift on departure which was also unexpected and gave a caring impression of the Riad.  The Riad itself was a tranquil place where we could totally relax and feel very comfortable in.  I would totally recommend this Riad to any travellers to Marrakech it was close to a lot of the tourist places which we wanted to visit and we could walk there easily ( 2 of us were seniors).

Riad Dar Anika,GemmaK123 wrote a review Mar 2013,50,Can I move in?!,As all the reviews on Trip Advisor were SO good I was a bit worried the riad was almost destined to fall short. On arrival you are welcomed warmly and plenty of time is spent with you explaining where to go and answering any questions on the area. This Riad only has 12 rooms and over the days we stayed it began to feel like home! The layout is great as there are plenty of places to have a relaxing mint tea whether it be on the terrace in the lounge or on one of the other floors. The team there are brilliant; genuinely friendly and surpass themselves to go that extra mile for you. Small touches like fetching blankets so you can sit outside to watch sunsets at night when it's cooler packed lunches remembering how you like your eggs/tea in the morning are a welcoming change from chain hotels.    We also had the set dinner - wow. All i can say is I have never seen so much (yummy!) food in my life. It was great! The Moroccan salads were the best we had all holiday and the lamb was delicious. Breakfast was also plentiful and set you up for the day ahead- great home-made yoghurt and bread daily.    The location is also perfect. An easy stroll to the main square and really close to 3 of the main attractions. Bedrooms were spotless and lovely comfy pillows. Also liked the dressing gowns.    On the plane home we overheard some other people discussing their stay in a 5 star hotel and they said the service they received was half hearted at best.

Riad Dar Anika,tony_g_9 wrote a review Mar 2013,50,Haven of Tranquility,From the melee of the street markets in Marrakech you go through the black door into the tranquility of Riad Dar Anika. Without doubt this must be one of the best small hotels in the world. Never have we experienced service like this. From the rose petals around your room when you arrive to the friendly helpful staff the service was exceptional.    The dinner is a MUST. You will be amazed by the quality and the quantity (the only complaint is that the tables were too small to hold it all).    Abu insisted that we did not tip anyone individually (and the staff did not expect it) but we just had to give a tip at the end.    All this does not come cheap but when it came to paying the bill most of the small services like tea and cakes were free of charge. How many other hotels would do that for you?    We have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Harpenden, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tony_g_9
Riad Dar Anika,porvera wrote a review Mar 2013,50,Wonderful,Marrakech is quite unlike anywhere in Europe. It is more than you can imagine.An assault on the senses in every way. Dar Anika is an oasis of calm in the Medina.  From our arrival at the airport to our departure everything is taken care of. On the first night we had dinner in the riad and this is something I would recommend. For authentic Moroccan food I dont think you will do better.  The staff our great and Samir is a font of knowledge and is happy to recommend trips what to do and what not to do.  Some really nice touches such as the welcome mint tea and cakes right through to our packed lunch for the plane journey home.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/porvera
Riad Dar Anika,sssinmia wrote a review Mar 2013,50,So fabulous we are already planning to organize a far-flung-family reunion here,"Thank you Trip Advisor friends. Your stellar reviews led us to a truly wonderful 5 day stay at Riad Dar Anika. Particularly appreciated: the welcoming ceremony; the spotless and upgraded room; the hour-long ""introduction to Marrakesh"" the first morning with Abu owner and host extraordinaire who gave us excellent information and confidence to make the most of our stay; a most comfortable location at the end of the souk which I found I much preferred to other riad locations around the area; and the staff who actually went out to try to buy a converter at 9 pm when ours broke who remembered our names and who seem to be really enjoying their jobs. Unexpected bonuses: lovely rooftop terrace for the hearty breakfast; complimentary yummy traditional soup served each evening; help changing US dollars without having to go outside; help arranging a tour and airport transfers; and a colorful community of people just outside the door who have been living there for over 30 years. So unexpectedly relaxing to be so well taken care of in this very unfamiliar city. I could just simply move into Riad Dar Anika; we will certainly be bringing our far-flung family to enjoy the hospitality. Could not be any better. Cannot think of one suggestion for improvement which my friends will assure you is highly unusual for me. Don't hesitate.

Riad Dar Anika,Carole C wrote a review Mar 2013,50,Outstanding,We stayed at Dar Annika for 4 nights having chosen it because of other Trip Advisor reviews. We had a fantastic time and were treated beautifully from the second we arrived until we left. The staff were pleasant attentive (to the right degree) and provided everything we could want. We had a very pretty room (number 6) which looked out onto a street leading up to the main square (5 minute walk) Our initial thoughts that this could be a noisy room were totally unfounded.On our last night we had a meal at the riad which was superb...by far the best meal we had and a highlight of our stay.

Riad Dar Anika,Debbie1999 wrote a review Feb 2013,50,Outstanding,This was my first visit to Marrakech and I am so pleased that we chose Riad Dar Anika with the help of the Trip Advisor reviews. Our stay was amazing The owners  manager and every member of the staff were incredibly helpful. They explained the good interesting and less safe areas of the city giving us maps and explaining how to get to the best areas and sites. They advised on where to eat safely and recommended itineries for our length of stay that allowed us to see as much as possible whilst we were there.  Breakfasts were amazing and we also ate there two evening meals which were traditional Morroccan cuisine delicious and in great quantity !  The bed was incredibly comfortable and room was immaculate.  Taxis arrranged whenever we needed them at very reasonable costs the mint tea was delicious and plentiful...........I really cant say enough about the standards of this Riad we enjoyed every aspect of our stay there and would highly recommend it to anyone that is thinking of going to Marrakech,Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Debbie1999
Riad Dar Anika,ozallan wrote a review Feb 2013,50,Exceptional Service,"I have only got raves for this place. The service and hospitality are exceptional from the welcoming ""ceremony"" to the Moroccon soup each evening. Nothing is a trouble the staff remember your name and it is sincere.probably the best service I have had anywhere in the world.  The decor and finishes are classy as well as homely. It is an oasis from the noise and mayhem just outside the door. There is wifi throughout the establishment and even a small swimming pool in the lobby. There is a rooftop terrace overlooking the hussle and bussle below.  The breakfasts are delicious especially the yoghurt and the eggs are to die for!!  The rooms are a good size but if you can get an upgrade it gets even better.  I could have spent a week in just in the Riad without going out into the old city of Marrakech. But the excitement of Marrakech is just in walking distance from the front door. All the main sites are close by.  I would strongly recommend this Riad and hope that I have another opportunity to stay here. I just loved it.

Riad Dar Anika,Federico G wrote a review Feb 2013,50,Probably the best place to stay in Marrakech,As I work for an airline I have the privilege to travel a lot. I've visited many hotels riads and resorts mainly around Europe and as far as I'm concerned I can say that it's very difficult to find something even close to this Riad. The structure have been completely rebuilt using high european standards while preserving the genuine Moroccan style. Everything have been studied to make it comfortable. On top of it the service to the customer it's something incredible! You'll have one (or even two) people looking after you!

From the moment we arrived we were greeted beautifully with milk cookies treats etc The breakfasts on the roof terrace are something we will never forget. The mint tea and freshly baked goodies were to die for. Please go for the cheese omelettes baked in tagine dishes - delicious!. Also lovely coming in from a night out and have a last drink of the evening in front of the real fire which you will have to share with their pet tortoise who also loves the warmth of the fire! We stayed for 5 nights and it was for my husband's 50th birthday...we asked for a room swap and they did with no problem. They even provided my husband with a gorgeous birthday cake on the morning of his birthday; which was totally unexpected and greatly appreciated. Rooms are gorgeous with bath robes and rose petals scattered over the rooms are a lovely touch. The hosts were fantastic with giving us excellent advice about where to go and even booked us taxis and restaurants. Just excellent personal service without a doubt!

Riad Dar Anika,CharlieinTexas wrote a review Jan 2013,50,"Go. Now. Wonderful Riad with friendly, attentive service",First time / first night in Morocco. Arrived around 6 p.m. to a somewhat chaotic street scene on the edge of the Medina. Then into paradise (in every way). Warm greeting from Tarek and Joab (so sorry as I know I've butchered the names of these fabulous fellows) followed by milk and dates then mint tea and cookies. Romantic interior including rose petals on the way to the room then in the room (all over including the bath). Romance plus! Invited to relax and clean up before our dinner. Do not miss out on the dinner (which I sort of reluctantly signed up for figuring we'd be a bit road weary our first night). So glad we ate at the Riad . . . the food was great and just kept coming and coming. Amazingly warm attentive service at dinner and during our entire stay. Breakfast on the terrace which was much more than merely a continental-style breakfast i.e. eggs any style. 5 minute walk to the main square. Wonderful people watching from the terrace in the early a.m (with great sunrise) and end of the day. Stayed two nights perfect stay. Highly recommend this Riad. Note that I booked this Riad through Priceline so not only was it perfect in every way the price was less than $100/night.,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Austin, Texas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlieinTexas
Riad Dar Anika,Travel Foodie wrote a review Dec 2012,50,An Absolute Delight!,"Firstly I want to say a Big ""Thank you"" to Samir Abou and Halima for the overwhelming hospitality they showed us. Being Irish our national motto to visitors in Gaelic is ""Cead Mile Failte"" which means 'a hundred thousand welcomes'; well this is exactly what we received in Riad Dar Anika!  When we arrived we were greeted by the warm and friendly Samir who ushered us into a beautiful Morrocan style lounge were our hands were cleansed with rose water and we were first given ornate chalices of t mint tea which was traditionally poured from a height. Followed by glasses of almond milk dates and some Morrocan pastries. We were then left there to relax and soak up the mystique of our surroundings while we unwound from our journey.  The Riad itself is located right in the heart of Marrakech amidst all the hustle and bustle of the souks and the mystical palaces and mosques. It is only a few minutes walk from the famous Djemaa el fna the massive square where you will see snake charmers and monkeys and souks selling everything you can imagine. Yet once inside the doors of the Riad you will find yourself in a peaceful tranquil oasis.  You must have dinner in this Riad at least once as it was the best traditional Morrocan food we tasted. On our first night the chef Halima made us a feast of several different tagines. It was Superb! She also took me down and showed me the kitchen one evening as I showed an interest in how the food was prepared! I was delighted!  Abou the owner was so helpful and told us all the sites to see and where was good to eat etc. a lovely man!  Every evening we were offered a bowl of Harira soup to comfort us.  Samir would organise our taxis to take us to and from restaurants and he even organised and paid for our bus journey to Agadir when we were leaving. On top of that we were given a packed lunch for the journey!

Riad Dar Anika,Mark566538 wrote a review Dec 2012,50,Our Wonderful Family Christmas 2012,"This was our first visit to Morocco and ""WOW!!"" what a Christmas break we had. On leaving a wet and cold England on the 22nd December we were a little apprehensive as we relied heavily on the reviews on Trip Advisor's website in making our decision to stay at Dar Anika. Not only did Dar Anika meet our expectations they exceeded them!! Having organised our airport transfers with the most helpful and friendliest of drivers we were subject to the most incredible welcome we have ever experienced! We were greeted in the traditional Moroccan way by the most wonderful staff who provided us with milk and dates followed by mint tea and pastries.  The riad is just wonderful; it's so quiet and peaceful inside even though it is well positioned close to the El Badi and Bahia Palaces and a short walk to the Jemaa-el-Fna Square. The decor is lovely with plenty of comfortable seating areas inside and on the terrace. There is a pool and a hamman. Our rooms (1 double & 1 twin) were spotlessly clean and decorated with rose petals. Bottled mineral water pastries fruit bathrobes and toiletries were provided. We have travelled extensively in Europe and we have never experienced such hospitality in our lives before. We were made to feel extremely welcome and special; in fact truly spoilt! The hospitality was what you would expect of a 5* hotel but without the high price tag.  All the staff at the Riad are helpful kind polite and friendly. The food is exceptional and plenty of it too. Breakfasts were served on the terrace and consisted of fruit yoghurt fresh orange juice warm bread rolls pancakes condiments cake a variety of egg dishes and good coffee even English tea! The 3 course meals offered in the evenings were freshly prepared daily and of the highest quality. The wine which was recommended by the waiters was extremely good too. The waiters are well trained knowledgeable and couldn't do enough for us.  Samir manages this impeccable riad. He is very friendly approachable and helpful. He makes time to hold a meeting with you at the beginning of your stay to give advice and make suggestions on where to go what to see where to eat arrange excursions inform you to how much to pay for taxis or horse and carriage rides etc. and provide you with a packed lunch on the day of your return. We were really impressed that he provided us with his mobile telephone number in case we felt that we needed help or got lost - this was very reassuring. He organised a wonderful Christmas gala meal on Christmas Eve which included aperitifs wine water wonderful food and traditional Moroccan & Berber entertainment as well as an Xmas tree! We also discovered some wonderful roses in our rooms with a note from the staff of the riad wishing us 'a merry Christmas'. His attention to detail and thoughtfulness was again a lovely touch. Samir also arranged a day trip to the Ourika valley to visit 3 Berber villages for us with the driver who collected us from the airport. The driver deserves a mention too as he made this trip a 'must do'. We felt in safe hands throughout. As well as being a good driver with a large comfortable air-con car he was friendly helpful and provided us with much information on the area and the villagers. He even surprised our sons by giving them the opportunity to get dressed up and have a camel ride (they thought they were only stopping for a photo shoot!).  We also met Abdul the owner of Dar Anika. A lovely man who should be very proud of Samir and all the staff. He has created a place to stay within the Medina which is truly magnificent.  This was our first visit to Marrakesh and it has been such a fantastic experience and one we will remember always. We would love to return sometime in the future and will recommend Dar Anika to anyone wanting to visit Marrakesh.",Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Ross-on-Wye, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mark566538
Riad Dar Anika,Andy M wrote a review Dec 2012,50,Our Magical Honeymoon,Travelling to Morocco for our honeymoon naturally we were in high spirits and expecting a wonderful week together but I must make it clear from the start of this review that Riad Dar Anika not only exceeded our expectations but went out of their way at practically every opportunity to make us feel welcomed special and appreciated. We both agreed that we will NEVER experience better hospitality again in our lives especially at such a reasonable price.    The staff at the Riad are helpful kind and friendly. Nothing is too much trouble and from the moment we arrived they were making helpful suggestions on where to go what to see and what to eat and where to eat it. We asked for a week of genuine Moroccan experiences and every option was made available to us and all taken care of so that we didn't have to worry about making excursion bookings restaurant bookings or finding directions. Some excellent advice was to enjoy getting lost in the souks how much we should be looking to pay for items (they drive a hard bargain in Marrakech!) and where and who we should avoid when out and about. We felt that the staff were approachable on any topic whether it related to our stay in their accommodation or just general advice on our plans for the day. They even prepared sandwiches for us to eat on the plane on the way home (much more tasty and cheaper than anything you can get on Easyjet! :) )    The staff are headed by the polite hard working and friendly Samir. We loved meeting him and enjoyed sharing a joke with him when he had time to chat. He was there to serve us breakfast in the morning and to serve us a drink late in the evening. A real gentleman and a very kind man he really seemed to take pride in his work. The food served at the Riad is plentiful clean and tasty. It was the best food we ate in the whole week and we tried many of the recommended local restaurants by way of comparison. We were truly spoiled!

Riad Dar Anika,HaroldJdK wrote a review Nov 2012,50,A more than complete package,Riad Dar Anika offered really everything that we had hoped and searched for when we booked our trip to Marrakech. The Riad has a beautiful and comfortable Morrocan style interior and is ideally located in the Medina. The taxi that had been arranged to pick us up from the airport drops you of in front of the main door of the Riad and it's only 7 minutes walk via one main path/road to the Djemaa el Fna square. So no worries to get lost in the Medina at all.    The staff is super friendly and does really everything possible to make you feel comfortable and all in a very personal way. From the moment we arrived we were spoild with drinks snaks and little attentions in our room the lounge or on the toof terrace and that continued untill the early morning that we left when we were offered a pakced lunch for our journey home.  Having a delicious breakfast with all kinds of home made bread cakes and flesh fruit salade in the early morning sunshine on the roof terrace is a very relaxing start of the day. On the night of my 50th birthday they prepared a special Morrocan diner for us with all the best dishes from the menu. We enjoyed that very much.

Riad Dar Anika,BeckyLambert27 wrote a review Nov 2012,50,An outstanding Riad,Wow this Riad really is the most fabulous accomadtion I have ever stayed in and I have stayed in five star hotels all over the world. My husband and I spent our honeymoon here and we were treated like a king and queen for the duration of our stay. We were picked up from the airport four hours before we should have checked in and taken back to the Riad to be welcomed with milk pastries and mint tea. We were then shown to our spotless beautiful room- wonderfully spread petels fresh flowers pastries and a large bottle of water helped us to settle in. We freshened up and we were then given a very detailed explanation of things to do in the area with a map. We had brought a guide from the UK but we really didn't need it! After a wonder around the souks we enjoyed a refreshing dip in the pool. We ate in the Riad the first night I would highly recommend this the food was divine. We asked to eat on the roof terrace you can see many of the famous buildings of Marrakesh from the roof. The wonderful waiters set up our table in minutes. It was perfection and so romantic. The location of Dar Anika is fantastic right in the middle of everything but once you shut the doors it is so peaceful. If I could describe the service I would say it was six star. The owner arranged a trip to the coast for us the night before we went they arranged a cooking class for us and when my husband asked where to buy cigerates the owner insisted on going out and buying them for him with no charge for the cigerates. We were offered fresh juice every day and the owner give us a free bottle of argan oil before we went for a hammam one day. Breakfast was delicious home made and enough to fill you until dinner. On our last day we didn't leave until 5pm we took our bags out at 12pm to check out and were asked what we were doing and that we could have the room until we leave and when we did leave we were given a packed lunch for the journey. We want to go back already we really were made to feel as if we were at home.

Riad Dar Anika,Kirbslondon wrote a review Oct 2012,50,Fabulous place,Do not look further than Dar Anika when booking your accomodation in Marrakech. A group of 4 of us have just returned from a fabulous 3 nights here. The riad is traditional well cared for and in a superb location to discover the delights of Marrakech. From the moment we arrived until leaving I was impressed with the hospitality. We received a lovely welcome had an excellent meal with live music (suggest you have a meal here) very comfortable beds and bathrooms very clean lovely relaxing roof terrace excellent breakfast drinks/food served all day/night transfer to airport we were even provided with a delicious sandwich for the airport!

Riad Dar Anika,Mehreenraheal wrote a review Oct 2012,50,Magnificent an experience never to be forgotten.. Highly Reccamended ..,Mr Abu and the entire staff at dar Anika are the most wonderful people I have stayed with.with the options of any 5 hotels we chose this one. Hidden in the old part of this pink city Marrakech the door opens and I am left completely awestruck .. The welcome drink mint tea dates and milk is served to us while we wait to check in.. Mr Abu upgrades us and a beautiful suite I come across a note wishing me a happy birthday with flowers is left for me to smile about... Had it not been for mr Abu and the entire we would have been clueless in this city .. All tours were organized goods bought for us so we would not get ripped off.. Fantastic massages and romantic roof top .. dinners... It was a home away from home.. I was completely spoilt and loved.. And it's coming from some one me who travels the world and has stayed at most luxury hotels ... When leaving my heart sank..as every one at dar Anika felt like family .. I will definitely go back..

Riad Dar Anika,sushmitasissons wrote a review Oct 2012,50,Absolutely amazing!!!!!,We visited marrakech in june 2012 and we are sorry for not putting up a review until now. It is hard to do full justice to this wonderful place to stay. We had an incredible time. The riad is beautiful and the rooms clean and comfortable but what really put the Dar Anika above anywhere else we have stayed was the amazing friendly and personal service from everyone including the owner and all of the other staff. Whatever we wanted Samir and his team were immediately on hand to help out.  We were a little worried before our trip that staying in such an intimate place to stay might be a bit invasive and that the riad would not provide the creature comforts of a top class hotel. Those fears were completely misplaced. Nothing was too much trouble and we had the most relaxing and stress free first trip to Marrakech. To give just a few examples there was some issue with our apple laptop accessing the free wifi. The owner simply gave us one of his laptops to use as our own for the duration of our trip. One evening we wanted to have dinner on the roof terrace - they set up a table just for us and cooked what we wanted. There was no menu they just asked - tell us what you would like! On an impulse we hired a scooter to get around. The staff parked this for us and then brought it back first thing in the morning without any prior warning. In short they made us feel at home. Infact more than a review this is a huge thank you to the people working there who made us feel really special.,Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bletchley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sushmitasissons
Riad Dar Anika,Cosmeston30 wrote a review Oct 2012,50,Excellent,You must stay at this place. It is run by an absolutely lovely team whose main concern is to make sure you're comfortable and have the best stay possible. The rooms are very clean and there is a small sun terrace on the roof where you can eat breakfast or dinner (which was lovely). It's location is excellent and is right by the medina but an oasis of calm. It has a small pool where you can rest your weary feet after a day exploring. The owner sits down with you on arrival and goes through a map of Marrakech with you and gives you hints and tips for restaurants. The best boutique hotel ever. Our flight difnt depart until early evening and they let us hsve the room til 5pm for free and even gave us a lunchbox for the airport!

Riad Dar Anika,Slomoshalom wrote a review Sep 2012,50,Simply marvellous!,We stayed here with a group of friends and had the whole Riad for ourselves.    Every room is exquisite and very clean. It can be a bit noisy at times as these are old buildings with no concept of Sound insulation. However the Management has installed creative solutions to make our stay better.    Very friendly and helpful staff and Management.    It is a place from 1001 Arabian Nights. Marvellously and very tastefully decorated interiors and each room has a theme of its own.    Breakfast on the Terrace is a delight and really good.    The indoor thermal swimming pool and Hamam is a treat.

Riad Dar Anika,MRPYork wrote a review Aug 2012,50,Oasis in the City,"Well what can we say?  Undoubtedly a 5/5; a remarkable riad; an oasis of calm in the chaos that is Marrakech.

When we thanked the assistant manager she replied simply ""This is your home."" Rooms pool sun terrace all immaculately clean with staff diligent and dedicated.  There were many charming areas to sit in the riad plus an air conditioned lounge with a guest computer and library books.  Internet access was available throughout the hotel and free.

Riad Dar Anika,Francis E wrote a review Jul 2012,50,Best service,My sister and I stayed at this incredible riad for three nights. Upon arrival the manager made the mistake of thinking we were a couple so he put us in an upgraded suite with a king bed. I asked for a cot saying that we weren't dating. Instead he gave me another room completely for free for all three nights! It was incredible. We had two amazing suites for the price of ONE regular room.    Samir is the manager and he only continued to amaze throughout our stay. He is genuinely one of the most generous and eager people I have EVER met. Whenever we needed anything or even mentioned something he would go so far above and beyond our expectations. He arranged for us to have a cooking class with the fantastic chefs at the Riad taught us all about the city and was always on hand for for anything and everything. On our last night we decided we wanted to take home some cooking pots. He realized we wouldn't get a good price if we went to find them so he went out HIMSELF to bargain for one. Aside from that he was always opening up a cold beer for me pouring us wine tea and whatever else we could have dreamed of. He was a fantastic guy to talk to. Everyone who works at this Riad is in fact incredibly nice. It was easily the highlight of our entire trip through Morocco.

Riad Dar Anika,LEllis2009 wrote a review Jul 2012,50,"Amazing Place, Amazing Staff",Just had the most unbelievable stay at Dar Anika. My brother and I were here for three days and were completely stunned by the hospitality and beauty of this riad. The rooms are beautiful comfortable and clean. The pool is small but a perfect way to decompress and cool down after a long day in the hectic streets of Marrakech. The roof terrace offers spectacular views of the city and the breakfasts there are delicious. But the highlight of the Riad is the staff. Samir makes sure that you have everything you could possibly need including drinks toothbrushes directions unbiased recommendations or just general information on Morocco Islam the region etc. The three men helping Samir are wonderful quiet presences that attend to your every need. They are so sweet and are genuinely happy to help you with anything. The cook Hadima is fantastic and I would suggest taking a cooking class with her a great experience especially for one looking to learn about Morocco's special Tagine dish. I have never been to a place that delivers such unobtrusive and wonderful service.    This is a great place to stay is close to the medina and to the main square of Marrakech.

All the accommodations from Dar Anika are exceptional! Excellent decoration and lot of comfort - the Moroccan hospitality is present at all times!    The breakfast is mouth-watering! Natural yogurt fruits fresh breads jellies mint tea..oh the mint tea!!  And as advice if you have the opportunity you should have at least one dinner at Dar Anika. The food is delicious and you will experience a feast of the gods!  One thousand and one flavors and sensations!    I can only thank the entire staff for making the first trip of my mother and her friend to Marrakech unforgettable!    Special thanks to the owners of Riad: Abou Hafsa and Abou Milouk for the hospitality and kindness. Thanks to Mohamed Abdou and Tarik for their kindness and joy that they served us and amused by our adventures in the medina. The magnificent cooker Soulina Halima and her assistant Zibeb special thanks for our Moroccan cooking lesson (learning how to make the pear desert “apple’ sister” and the lamb was an incredible realization) and our amazing dinner! And the last but not the least thanks to Samir for his attention patience to try to understand my mom’s and her friend’s with their badly english and arabic (hehe).

Riad Dar Anika,Grumpyoldman wrote a review May 2012,50,What More Can One Say?,We chose the Dar Anika for a 5-night stay in Marrakech based largely on its positive reviews on Tripadvisor. Having experienced the wonderful hospitality of Abu and his staff for ourselves we can only agree with other contributors that it is an excellent choice. It was unseasonally hot when we visited - 40+ degrees in mid-May - and it was always a joy to come back to the relative cool and calm of the Riad after the heat and bustle of the souks and tourist sights. We found the location ideal being not only on the edge of the old city a short walk from the main sights but also directly accessible by taxi for arrival/departure and excursions. The Riad itself is as beautiful as it looks in the photos on their website and our room was spacious comfortable and very well equipped. The leisurely breakfasts were first class with a wide choice of fruit yoghurt pastries eggs etc. We also ate dinner in the Riad a couple of times and it was the best quality and best value Moroccan food and wine we experienced. But what really made our stay special was the incredibly friendly and helpful service we received and all the little extra touches which truly made us feel that nothing was too much trouble.,Date of stay: May 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, UK",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Grumpyoldman

There were no disappointments. Abu the proprietor briefed us on what to expect of the city. He arranged a trip to the Atlas Mountains. Hammam and massage were available in house. We had dinner and entertainment in one night which was excellent. His mantra ""anything you need just ask"" was believable in no small measure due to the friendly attentive staff.

Tastefully decorated and traditional but above all it felt so welcoming and homely. All the staff were fantastic especially Samir and Haidar and I'm not sure who cooked the meals but you MUST spend at least 1 night eating at the Riad but make sure it's towards the end of the trip as you will not find any better food service or entertainment.

It is in walking distance to the main souks the main square – Djemaa el Fna and the Bahia Palace. Every dinner we had was excellent - the best tagines we've eaten in Morocco. Each dinner is meticularly prepared on request. The staff were really warm and efficient and the owner Abu and his right hand man Samir went out of their way to make us feel at home and really special. Both spoke English fluently and were very helpful in organizing our entire trip.  They were also very accommodating of the special needs of our 7yr old daughter and her 73 yr old granny. And whenever there was a problem like one of us leaving a bag in the taxi that transported us from the airport Abu was quick to get hold of the taxi and retrieve the bag. When granny had a problem with a ring she bought at the museum shop again Abu went beyond the call of duty and accompanied her to the shop to make sure she either got a refund or another ring. This kind of service is rare in today’s tourism industry and I can honestly say that the Riad Dar Anika has impressed us in every way.

And treat yourself with a candlelight dinner made by the riads own chef afterwards. It is all tasty and made from ingredients bought the same day at the local market across the street. When we arrived we were greeted with mint tea dates and morrocain cookies and an inspirational introduction to the city including how to survive traffic handle souk sellers and get the most out of our intended routes and sightseeings.

The hotel is centrally located near all the major sites. The manager and staff are fantastic catering to all our needs. They produced an amazing breakfast on the roof terrace each day as well as a fabulous meal in our own private dining room one evening when we didn't feel like venturing out (at £16 per head for a delicious 3 course meal we thought this was really good value).  The rooms are comfortable and well equipped with modern bathrooms (including a lovely bath).  The Riad has only 10 rooms so we hardly saw other guests and seemed to have the beautiful roof terrace to ourselves whenever we went up there for tea or to relax after a day out.  A private guided tour and a restaurant booking were organised for us by the manager.

Riad Dar Anika,Feranimo wrote a review Mar 2012,50,"Amazing hospitality, serene atmosphere and great location","I stayed at the Ryad for 4 days and as a first time visitor to Marrakech I was anxious about finding the right accommodation at a reasonable price. The right accommodation to me meant great facilities excellent customer service good food good location (distance for all Marrakech has to offer) and nice cozy reasonably sized rooms. I read people's reviews on this Ryad and then called them directly to get a sense of what they were really like and it was the best decision i made because they sounded like they would tip all my boxes but i was still sceptical because sometimes what you expect isn't what you get when you actually get there. Upon arrival they welcomed me with mint tea and biscuits Abu the owner opened a map and told me what was what in Marrakech and generally guided me through what to do whilst I was there. He then took me on a tour of the Ryad from the hammam room by the courtyard to the roof top terrace where i could have breakfast. Samir the manager ensured I was well looked after on my trip made sure I didn't lack for anything went above and beyond the call of duty to make me extremely comfortable and told me what to look out for when I was out and about (he behaved like a caring big brother). The rest of the staff generally did everything to please me and make me forget I was in a hotel. Honestly I felt like I was at home even down to the TV and fire place in the living room area (and the blankets dotted around which I could wrap around myself if I felt a little chilly). Imagine being in your own home and not having to be in your bedroom to watch TV but either swimming in the pool in the courtyard or hanging out with friends in the very cozy well equipped living room? Imagine paradise in the midst of the beautifully exhilarating chaos of the old Medina in Marrakech Morocco. That's Riad Dar Anika for you. It allows you to step in and out into 2 different worlds. ""The best of both worlds"" this to me is what defines an amazing holiday. I got to see most of what Marrakech had to offer but still come back to the tranquility of an amazingly serene hotel. If you're planning a trip to Marrakech staying at Ryad Dar Anika is probably the best decision you'll make once you've booked your ticket because trust me Abu Samir and the rest of their team certainly know what to do and how to make you feel like a part of their family was coming home to visit. It's not really about hospitality it's about understanding what it really means to make a member of your family feel loved and welcome. Thank you Ryad Dar Anika for giving me one of the most memorable holiday experiences to date.

Riad Dar Anika,Lal02 wrote a review Mar 2012,50,"""Paradise and one of the must do things before you die""",On arrival to Marrakech we were met by our 'as promised' luxury transfer to the Riad in a lovely Mercedes. A short journey we were in the midst of the hustle and bustle of the old town surrounded by a 20 kilometre wall. I must admit that at first when the driver stopped I did start to wonder if we had come to the right place and that if we had made the right decision after all we had come away to get a peaceful break to recharge the batteries!. However after entering the Riad through the large wooden doors it was like walking into a different world altogether. This place is so peaceful and tranquil. We were led to our suite no2 which has a beautiful ornate ceiling dome and its own fireplace with plenty of room for ourselves and our young child to sleep. Power showers hot water not an issue!. Breakfast includes pancakes fresh breads sweet youghart Fresh fruits plenty of hot coffee and tea or you can go for the traditional mint tea. Breakfast served when you decide so if you decide to have a lie in there's no problem with missing breakfast like in most hotels.    There is no time zone difference from the UK and a short plane journey so an excellent place to spend a long weekend. Weather was great around 22c-23c in the day but does drop off to around 15c in the evening so take a coat with you if your planning to stay out all day.    The owner and his staff treated us more like family than guests. Everything was catered for. My son wanted to do an activity so they organised quad biking and the transport there and back. When it came to dinner the owner took us to the market which was literally over the road where we selected Monkfish tails chicken an array of fresh vegetables which were later cooked for us and the fish and chicken were presented in a tageine and cooked with 27 different spices fresh and delicious. The Riad is situated only a couple of minutes walk from the world famous Jemaa El Fna square which is really buzzing and all of the alleyways are crammed full of spice shops and other handmade items. A word of advice please haggle as the locals expect it and you will get some great deals!. Abu the owner of the Riad gave us a mobile phone with the Riads number pre-programmed he also gave us a map and marked out some of the must see places to visit. Again the level of service was second to none. As I mentioned earlier we came out to get some rest and recuperation so on the second day we had a Hammam similar to a Turkish bath and is located within the Riad. Straight after the refreshing and cleansing Hammam we were taken to our suite by some lovely ladies for an amazing and relaxing hour long massage. After this we needed a short sleep (so good was the experience).  There are two parts to Marrakech the old city and the new city. We travelled to the new city that evening again transport was organised for us (and very reasonably priced) there and back. There is a shopping plaza with all the shops you would expect in any vibrant city and surrounded by a beautiful waterfall. We ate at the Cafe de la post which has a french inspired menu and although a little pricey it was an amazing experience and well worth it. This break was fantastic and only made better by the excellent service and generousity of everyone at the Riad Dar Anika. On our departure they even made a packed lunch for us! words cannot express the gratitude and respect we hold for these people. We will (god willing) be back as there is much left to explore like the snow capped Atlas mountains which is your back drop whilst eating breakfast on the massive terrace in the morning!!. There are to many superlatives to describe this Riad and Marrakech.

Riad Dar Anika,kaliko47 wrote a review Feb 2012,50,A Jewel in Marrakech,I arrived in Marrakech on 2nd Feb with my expectant Daughter-in-law both of us in great need of rest tender loving care and a break from home. After a 15 mins bus ride from the airport we reached Jemaa El Fna and asked for directions to the Riad. I wish now that we had contacted the Riad beforehand as they would have sent a taxi to meet us at the airport. Hindsight is truly a wonderful thing! Once in front of the beautiful dark doors we knocked and were amazed at the treasure we had found. Firstly the staff greeted us with a smile and asked to take our cases and led us straight to the lounge and within minutes there was a tray with Morrocan tea and pastries. I was worried that we had arrived a couple of hours before the check-in time. But this was not even mentioned. The owner came and introduced himself and offered us a mobile phone which we could use throughout our stay either to contact the Riad if we hit any problems whilst we were out or to contact our family back home. (we added credits as and when we needed to)  The twin room (No4) was spacious with a double wardrobe a fridge safe a hairdryer and heater (as the evenings were quite cold at this time of the year). The bathroom was clean and included bathrobes which were a blessing. We loved relaxing in them during the early evenings that we stayed in and when had late starts to our day. We even lounged on the roof terrace in them! I loved it.  Each day we were offered help in deciding on where to explore next on the local customs how to haggle the best method of transport etc. Basically they was not anything that they couldn't provide. On day 3 we realised that we had forgotten our iphone charger. The owner provided us with one as well as an ipod docking station that we could use in our room in the lounge or on the roof terrace! From the terrace you can see the magnificent Atlas mountains. We took the opportunity of mid-morning naps on the roof loungers. Great way to soak in the sunshine!  The staff were so respectful and caring. They were so keen to ensure that we enjoyed our stay. It was their warmth and genuine interest in us as guests that would make me visit again.  It was worth dining in for lunch or dinner as the meals were excellent and very generous portions. The owner has done a marvelous job in combining luxury with comfort and great hospitality. We have returned home well rested nourished and recharged.  I would recommend Dar Anika to anyone single couples and families. It has been a haven for us.,Date of stay: February 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,Midi in UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaliko47
Riad Dar Anika,Caroline B wrote a review Feb 2012,50,An Experience I will remember for ever!!,I have never stayed anywhere quite like Riad Dar Anika. To be fair I didn't even know what a Riad was! The welcome we received was warm and sincere. The hussle and bussle of the Medina outside was exciting and a bit crazy then once behind the huge beautiful doors of Riad Dar Anika was tranquility calm and smells that were a feast for the sences. Our room was large and beautifully done traditional yet contemporary comforatable and So peaceful. We relaxed on the roof terrace on comfy sun loungers. In the evenings we chilled by the log fire and we ate the most amazing food! Lamb Tagine washed down was lashings of fantastic Moroccian wine which was suprisingly very nice indead. We explored Marrakech the YSL gardens and the markets. The highlight was the Riad. I went with my cousin who had made all the arrangements. We have both travelled fairly extensively but have NEVER known hospitality like that of Riad Dar Anika. The staff could not do enough for us to make us comfortable and welcome talk about go the extra mile!!! I can't wait to go back and wouldn't even consider staying anywhere else! As for value for money its fantastic value. I can't wait to recommend to family and friends they will love it. I can't think of a single negative. A fancy hotel is a fancy hotel. You could be anywhere in the world they are all much of a muchness. A Riad has a completely differant ambiance. Its So relaxed friendly and the sense of calm is to be relished and soaked up. The manager and his team of wonderful staff have something special going on at their beautiful Riad Dar Anika. It was magical and guess what......... I Highly recommend it!,Date of stay: February 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Harrow, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolineB691
Riad Dar Anika,fiona w wrote a review Jan 2012,50,"Wall to wall luxury, exceptional accommodation, food and service",This boutique hotel is simply superb! I have visited a number of 5* hotels over the years but none top this one as hospitality is second to none and the service is out of this world. After learning that we were celebrating our wedding anniversary we got upgraded to a suite and a large bouquet of roses was delivered to us!  The room was very clean well appointed with everything you would need. It was also recently refurbished with great attention to detail. Everything was hand crafted locally apart from the laptop with the free internet access.    The food was fantastic. We expected to pay much more than we did for food and beverage but were pleasantly surprised by how reasonably priced everything was.    The two hour massage hammam and scrub is a truly soothing experience. Well worth it.    We have told all our friends and family about Dar Anika and thinking of coming back and booking the entire Riad for all of us to enjoy!

Riad Dar Anika,Diana W wrote a review Jan 2012,50,"loved it, will go again",My adult daughter and I spent a lovely week here and loved it. The superb breakfasts on the roof and one night we enjoyed a delicious evening meal in the Berber tent on the roof; all very luxurious. Our room normally a double was easily split into two singles and we had a very comfortable stay always given the lovely mint tea stuffed with mint leaves in a glass whenever we wanted it. It is a great place to relax in the heat of the day and so near all the places of interest you would want to visit including a great restaurant called Tagine.    Samir arranged for us a driver to take us to the coast for the day and a guide to the souks for another half day. When we travelled to the Atlas mountains for a day he even checked up part way through the day with our driver to ensure we were OK and enjoying it! Couldn't have asked for more.

Riad Dar Anika,kayexalate wrote a review Jan 2012,50,Would give it Six stars if I could!,My wife (who is 6 months pregnant) and I stayed at Riad Dar Anika for 4 nights. Our stay was excellent and the owner Samir and his brother own a top notch operation.    The Riad is superbly located--only a few minutes walk to Jemma El Fna and just a few minutes the other direction to many of the sights (Bahia palace Saadian tombs Dar Si Said). So it was nice to see one thing come back to the riad to rest and then head out again.    The Riad itself is beautifully done--very elegant and holding true to the definition of a Riad--it has water (a plunge pool) greenery and an open roof which lets in lots of sun. Even though the riad is right in the heart of the medina it is very quiet and once entering in through the door it is tranquil and relaxing. My wife and I slept very well and we're pretty light sleepers.    The room is tastefully decorated and beds were comfortable. The common areas (lounge sitting room terrace) are nicely done as well and allows one to relax but not feel confined to being in your room.    Wifi worked well and was nice to be able to stay connected. No TV was a good idea as it kept noise level down.    The thing that impressed us the most was the staff. They were all extremely polite and attentive always asking if we needed anything. The staff all spoke English very well and communication (for non Arabic speakers) was easy.    My wife was ill with a stomach bug (which ironically she contracted in Spain before we even arrived in Morocco) the first day. Samir and his assistants made sure she was taken care of and provided some nice soup that she was able to eat when she was too fatigued to go out to get something to eat. It was a really nice touch and genuine not something they did expecting to get money or tips.    Overall I couldn't find any faults with Riad Dar Anika. I've travelled to nearly 70 countries and stayed in all types of lodgings from 5* hotels to pensions and hostels. This place is well worth the price you pay and I highly recommend it.    By the way I don't typically write reviews on places unless I had a bad experience but in this case I felt it was worth my time to share my experience.,Date of stay: January 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Orinda, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kayexalate

Riad Dar Anika,Sherina H wrote a review Jan 2012,50,Top choice - a home from home :),Having just returned from Marrakech and this Riad I completely agree with all previous positive comments. The manager Samir and full time host Abdul made us feel at home straight away. They ensured we knew were to go daily and at night for dinner making reservations and inquiries at the slightest mention. The owner too was extremely welcoming and although we saw the 4/5 * hotels we would usually have chosen we were all so glad we did not! No hotel could make you feel as comfortable safe or get the personal touch as we did at the Riad. Dar Anika is well hidden so you slip behind the bustling market stalls into this chic sanctuary and it's so quiet !!! Although we opened the stained glass windows to let in the Marrakech sounds - delightful!  The staff even changed all our money back before we left and gave us special soaps and the tastiest sandwiches for the trip home.  You'd do yourself a big favor to choose Dar Anika if planning a trip to Morocco.  Beautiful people beautiful place very happy holiday .....enjoy !,Date of stay: December 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Windsor, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SherinaH
Riad Dar Anika,Elizabeth B wrote a review Nov 2011,50,Hidden Gem,As soon as we stepped out of our taxi outside Dar Anika just a few steps away from Jemma El-Fenna we were greeted by the hustle and bustle of Marrakesh. Leaving the lively sounds of the outside world behind us and entering the Riad we knew we had made the perfect choice! It was as if we stepped into another tranquil mystical world that left us in awe of what was yet to come.    The place is beyond charming with a warm and inviting setting. Open courtyard with a very inviting heated pool surrounded by burning flames all around it. Whilst on the opposite side  we were welcomed into a cozy room with an open fire where we were welcomed with soothing morrocan tea and delicious pastries whilst gentle music was floating in the background.    Moments later we were shown to our very spacious room which was decorated in the same tastful manner as the rest of the Riad. Warm colours inviting bed great bathroom with colourful mosaic sofa for the both of us to snuggle opposite the open fireplace....Honestly the room didn't lack a thing! We were reluctant to leave but the sights sounds and smells of Jemaa el-Fenna were calling out for us....    Before we set out into the labyrinth of alleyways which would lead us to the main square the staff were helful and gave us a thorough step by step guide on where to go or not to go what to watch out for and some excellent places to go eat;since picking a place to eat on your first visit could be rather daunting.    I don't think anything could have prepared us for what was to come.... Strolling along you want to take everything in from the snake charmers to the colourful food stalls the spices and the rugs the silver and the gold. The atmosphere is festive and it seems it always has that uplifting air carrying you along with it....    A couple of hours later we emergerd exhilarated and triumphant making our way back to the Riad. Before going back up to the room we went up take a look at the roof top terrace where we decided to kick back and have a drink before having our massage in Dar Anikas hamam which was divine.    The massage was exactly what we needed after our visit to the souks and before retiring into our room before embarking on our next adventure the following day....    The next few days brought with it the same promises as the first day. I really can't seem to fault Marrakesh nor the exotically serene Dar Anika. Perfection at its best is just one of the simplest ways to describe our stay and experience. Cannot wait to return!

Riad Dar Anika,Ribal A wrote a review Nov 2011,50,Beautiful Riad close to everything,My friend and I stayed at Dar Anika for four days and had the best time. The staff were amazing you can be served a meal anywhere in the riad and at any time at great value. The breakfast was included and up on the top terrace was a great start to the day with the birds singing all around you. the riad is perfectly situated - we only had a four minute walk to the souk/Jama el fena square. The hotel also organised for a guide to show us some of the historic points in the area worthwhile as he had such a wealth of knowledge which really added to the experience.  If you want a relaxing (sooo relaxing) break in beautiful surroundings with friendly staff (including one of the best hammam and massage I've ever had) then try Dar Anika.

We were treated to an upgraded room and tea dates and milk upon arrival.

We had no idea what to expect but were thrilled from the moment we walked in off the bustling noisy streets into the oasis of cool calm loveliness that is Dar Anika. Location is brilliant - a 5 minute walk and you're at the main square. Lovely rooms a plunge pool (absolutely essential with temperatures of 42 degrees) and great advice from Samir about where to go and what to do with only a short space of time happily making reservations for us at some of the most gorgeous restaurants. At no extra cost a member of staff even escorted me to the local market so I could buy some fish to feed to Molly (the cat that appears frequently on the roof - I think she's a permenant feature) - they must have thought I was absolutely bonkers but didn't say a word (and the man at the market was so lovely that he gave me the fish for free)!

Riad Dar Anika,LauraJane83 wrote a review Jan 2011,50,"Beautiful Riad, great location and fantastic staff",My sister and I spent 4 nights at the Dar Anika in Jan 2011.    The Riad is situated on a small road leading directly to the Djemaa el-Fna (a 10 minute stroll). Despite its very central location the Riad is very tranquil.    The Riad is beautifully decorated and has some gorgeous pieces of Moroccan furniture. Beds are comfortable and the whole place is immaculate.    During our stay the friendly staff Majdouline and Samir recommended some great places for us to visit including Theatro (club) Palais Jad Mahal (restaurant with entertainment) and Comptoir (restaurant with great bar). They also arranged guided tours of the local area and an excursion to the Atlas Mountains which I would recommend although if you plan on doing the trek to the waterfalls good walking boots and a head for heights are essential.    On our first night we had a wonderful dinner in the lounge in front of an open fire which was delicious. We had our breakfasts on the roof terrace which consisted of fresh breads/preserves yoghurt fruit salad fresh cakes/pancakes (differed each day) and fresh OJ / tea/coffee which really set us up for the day. There is no set time for breakfast - you can go whenever you like which was a lovely touch.

Riad Dar Anika,Norton09 wrote a review Dec 2010,50,Riad-ical,After a bumpy start due to our travel agent (STA) we were delighted to arrive at Riad Dar Anika! The grand traditional wooden doors hide a beautiful sanctuary from the hectic city. My wife and I were well looked after by the friendly staff (in particular Samir and Abdu). Abdu served us our roof terrace breakfast and greeted us when we came home from exploring each day with a familiar smile and joke. While the room we were initially provided was lovely we were delighted when Samir upgraded us to a larger room. The rooms and Riad are all beautifully decorated (like a scene from Arabian Nights) and we were made to feel 'well at home' whether in the glass fronted sitting room or cosy roof top tent. The Riad is only a few minutes from the main square and there are 2 fantastic restaurants (Tanjia & Dar Essalam) nearby. We also frequented a nearby bar (Kosybar) where you can watch the storks (!) and enjoy reasonably priced wine (starting at £15 per bottle). We recommend arranging dinner in the Riad as part of your stay. Our Wedding Anniversary was made truly memorable by the intimate surroundings beautifully decorated table (thank you Abdu!) and delicious locally sourced food. Can't wait to come back!

He can organise anything you need....we had a private guide for 4 hours called Cam who was brilliant and showed us around (£35)  a hammam scrub (£10) massage (£35) a day at Nikki Beach club(arranged free entry which is normally £25 each for a sunbed but be aware food and drinks there are expensive and there are alternative places to go and spend a day by a pool). The rooms were spotless the plunge pool and roof terrace relaxing and the breakfast included in the price was fresh...continental style...can recommend dinner at Dar Essalam 5 minute walk typical Morrocan food with music and belly dancing. Would also recomend taking a tour on a horse and carriage in the Medina for about 1 1/2 hours(£25....you haggle with the guy).

Riad Dar Anika,BristolKate wrote a review Jun 2010,50,Amazing experience,we stayed in Dar Anika for 5 nights and had a top class personalised experience from the moment we arrived. There were beautiful personal touches from the letter in our room welcoming us to being given an option each morning of where and when to have our breakfast. Each time we arrived back at Dar Anika it was like coming home. the location is wonderful for reaching all the main attractions of the medina on foot so when the pace became too fast (it was out first time in morrocco) it was easy to come back to a warm welcome and a cup of mint tea that was brought at any time of day (or night!). The breakfasts were delicious and the freshly baked goods each morning a real treat. The staff especially Salah and Samir are keen to assist whilst also leaving breathing space to use the roof garden and terrace as you would your own home and for them nothing is too much trouble.

Riad Dar Anika,100arumlilies wrote a review May 2010,50,"An a peaceful haven in fantastic, frantic Marakkesh",This riad delivered everything it promised and more. The rooms were beautifully presented being clean and comfortable and each one different (I think we saw them all).    As our daughter announced she would be home from university and able to join us we asked for an extra bed in our suite although security was such that she could have had her own room.    I had a huge itinerary of things we were going to do we did some the Atlas mountain trip arranged by the hotel the tour of the souk again arranged by the hotel lots of wandering around but the riad was just so nice we didn't want to leave it. Also we could have massages plus other treatments in the riad.    The teenager lay on a range of different sunbeds on the roof for approximately 4 days for as long as the sun shone. When we were out for the day she was served lunch seated at a table covered with a linen table cloth and laid with crystal and china and protected by a huge parasol. Just like a Disney princess.    The breakfast the staff the decor it's all been said before but it was faultless....... We particularly enjoyed the Thai food prepared to our order Moroccan food is good but the lovely Philipino cook prepared some great veggie dishes. The hotel recommended some excellent local restaurants so we did try out the local food too!    We loved the cinema room and the fact there was no TV in the bedroom. The pool was freezing but if you ask them the staff will heat it for the time you plan to use it.

Riad Dar Anika,PumpkinsUK wrote a review Mar 2010,30,Not a good hotel on rainy days,Marrakesh is supposed to be hot and dry all year long (that's what we thought in the first place) but unfortunately during our 3 day stay in Feb. it rained almost everyday (and from what we were told it had been raining for days before our arrival...). As the hotel is small and all built around an open air central courtyard the rain was flooding everywhere in the house most of the walls were damp - even in our room and en-suite bathroom - sewer smells were rising up from the drains.. Very far from the little oasis we had in mind !  I have no doubt this little place might be nice on summer time – the owners and staff are genuinely friendly – but better check the weather forecasts before you go..,Date of stay: February 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PumpkinsUK
Riad Dar Anika,Gmadaduke wrote a review Feb 2010,50,The Best.,I have stayed in many hotels motels riads inns outs dives and bungalows across the world. This was the best.    Never I have encountered such personalized service as I received from Samir the manager of the establishment and his colleague Yousef. Samir's unrelenting attention to detail is spectacular and his suggestions made for a great visit to Marrakech.    The riad itself is also spectacular. It is a relatively new construction and as a result has up to date heating and hot water (items I have been told can be rarities in other riads). The refined courtyard of the riad is wonderful for afternoon tea or a late night drink and really remains one of the enduring and fondest images of my trip to Morocco.,Date of stay: February 2010,Trip type: Traveled solo,New York,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gmadaduke
Riad Dar Anika,aoitravels wrote a review Jan 2010,50,A fantastic place to stay amid the frantic streets of Marrakech,My wife and I stayed at Dar Anika for a long weekend having selected it from the many positive entries on TA - to sum up our own experience is easy ... all of the existing comments are 100% correct!  From the minute we arrived until we had to leave Diane Nigel and all the staff were excellent nothing was too much trouble or effort to make sure we had an enjoyable weekend.    A couple of tips for you other TA's who will hopefully go and enjoy Dar Anika ...  1. Nigel’s restaurant recommendations are great - give them a try  2. Do have a personal guide and Mohamed is first class - his insight and friendly approach  really gave us the Marrakech experience  3. Diane & Nigel are also involved with a new venture at KSAR ANIKA - we were pleased  to be shown around have lunch and a massage ... its truly fantastic!

Riad Dar Anika,Wendyyil wrote a review Jan 2010,40,Marrakech,The Dar Anika is a calm tranquil escape from the husstle and busstle of the outside world. My sister and I stayed there from 26th December to the 2nd of January and were very pleased with the hospitality of the local Manager Norradine who looked after us during our stay. All the staff were pleasant and its as pretty as a picture. If I had one complaint it was that our room although decorated well had no windows and was very darkly decorated like most of Morrocco and after 7 nights this was over welming to say the least with no natural light or air. However Riads can be like this due to the heavy walls that incase the properties from the outside world. Marrakech itself is an eye opener and has to be experienced for oneself. From the eclectic and exotice hustle and bustle of the main square and the soukes to the great food and things to see its worth a visit.,Date of stay: December 2009,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wendyyil

It was the first time I had been to Marrakesh - it will not be the last. From the moment we stepped inside Dar Anika to the moment we left there was nothing but helpful advice great service and of course a fantastic ambience! Dianne Nigel and Nourredine could not have been friendlier! I especially would recommend the cooking lesson with Habiba - select your menu go to the local market with Habiba and Nigel buy your food - then go and watch/help Habiba at work. later on have it served to you on the rooftop terrace - fantastic! Our room was nice - with a little private 'garden area' off it. As soon as you stepped inside the hustle and bustle of the souks streets and vendors fell away. perfectly placed - only about 5-10 minutes to the main square accessed though a lovely little street. Found a great local spice market - where I bought loads of spices for very little! all in all a superb place to stay - and a very nice email from Dianne and Nigel to check we had arrived home safely - a nice touch!,Date of stay: October 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Edinburgh, Scotland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tardis314

It wasn't intrusive though - just there to help if you wanted it.. I have never had such great service anywhere in a hotel.

Riad Dar Anika,dishmop wrote a review Oct 2009,50,"Excellent, friendly, well-situated riad",As mother and 17 year old daughter travelling to Marrakech alone for the first time we were a little nervous but all our fears were allayed at the Riad Dar Anika.    The Riad is excellently run by a lovely English couple who clearly know how to make guests feel safe comfortable and at home. The rooms were spotlessly clean and comfortable. Inside the riad it is very quiet. None of the noise from outside was audible except for the regular calls to prayer which are amplified throughout the city. The air conditioning is also extremely quiet. The information pack helpfully provided a map and list of monetary exchange values The freshest bread and fruit were delicious for breakfast. Breakfast was served throughout the morning so we were under no pressure to get up earlier than we wanted to. Every single member of staff was polite helpful and friendly. The Riad is beautifully decorated in a Moroccan style which we would have liked to bring home. It is a five minute walk down one straight road to the Jmaa el Fna square and also very close to the Badii and Bahia Palaces. There are good restaurants and two ATMs very close by.    There is a very pleasant sun terrace and small enclosed swimming pool. Sunbathing and swimming were therefore clearly an option but the pool is small and the Riad is so close to the activity and life of Marrakech that we were not tempted to do so.,Date of stay: October 2009,Trip type: Traveled with family,warwickshire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dishmop

It is impeccably clean beautifully decorated and ideally located. Outside the cool calm riad it’s a short stroll through bustling and intoxicating streets to any of the main attractions including Djemma El Fna. The riad has all the luxuries you could want from a Moroccan boutique hotel; pool hamam wine list and menu air conditioning and no T.V. (a wonderful idea). Mouth watering breakfasts are served on the roof terrace as the medina comes to life below. But it’s the people that make this place. The staff are all consummate professionals friendly and always willing to help and advise. And the welcome and hospitality from genial hosts Di and Nigel made us feel like old friends returning. Having travelled around Morocco for 2 weeks we were ""welcomed home"" to Dar Anika for 2 nights. It was a pleasure to return to a hotel so clearly loved by owners and guests alike.

Riad Dar Anika,Kim0808 wrote a review Jun 2009,50,We had an amazing cooking lesson!,I marked the rooms high because we were shown around and everything was beautiful but we actually went for a cooking lesson while staying somewhere else in Marrakesh. It was a brilliant day from going to the market and picking our chicken (vegetarian options were available!) then to the fruit market and a glass of wine while we were talked through what we were about to learn. I took notes and had four pages of carefully written advice on how to make the beautiful salads chicken and fresh strawberry dessert. I was given a cook book to take away and after a thorough and fun lesson we had a break before sitting on the roof terrace to enjoy the results. We sat on a really beautiful terrace with a Stork on the minaret a short distance away – plenty of photo opportunities. The dinner was lovely and knowing how it was all prepared made it even better.

Nigel and Di whom we read about on this site were very welcoming but our main man while we were there (6 nights altogether) was Noureddine. He was extraordinarily gracious and helpful to us even to helping arrange a 5-day trip to the south and Erg Chebbi. The company he set us up with Morocco Tailormade turned out to be excellent.

We used the small pool in the courtyard twice for a very refreshing dip after a hot day's travelling then went up to the roof terrace for sunbathing. The roof terrace is also where they serve a very good breakfast.  One of the best features though is that Dar Anika is only about 10 minutes walk from Marrakech's iconic main square Djemaa el Fna and the souks so it was easy to get around in the evenings without using taxis or a car.

We thought Dar Anika was just right. It is a smallish place with a range of rooms and a pleasant central courtyard. There is a roof terrace and a tent on the roof if it is too hot in the sun. It is an unpretentious refuge from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech but is a great location - accessible by car but within an easy and very attractive walk from the central square.    The thing we really liked was that it is a great atmosphere and all the people there were really friendly and a good team who looked after us well. They helped plan our trip (we spent a few nights in the mountains as well)  they were able to give good advice when we were there about a wide range of things and of course were on hand when the end of a noisy hot time in the city demanded a beer or glass of rose.,Date of stay: April 2009,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LondonFriday
Riad Dar Anika,Jeff Paffett wrote a review Apr 2009,50,A calm oasis,We stayed in the Riad Dar Anika after spending a few days walking in the Atlas mountains. We got a wonderful welcome from Nigel and Diane who immediately made us feel at home.    We had a suite on the upper floor which was very spacious with a good sized bathroom.    The breakfasts were good with fresh juice and great French style bread (which was a treat surprisingly after a few days of arab bread). The weather was perfect to have breakfast on the roof terrace. We had a lunch a couple of times which was also very good.    You can dine at the hotel although you have to make your choice of dishes at lunch time. This tends to mean that the dining room is not very heavily used and so there's not much atmosphere although the food is very good. Also certainly while we were there the wine supply was a bit haphazard with none of the wines on the wine list available.    The position of the riad is great and you walk straight out of the door into a busy but not too touristy shopping street. It's an easy walk to all the main tourist sites.    Nigel and Diane are always ready to help with restaurant recommendations and booking and will tell you all the best places to shop.

Riad Dar Anika,JanieMM wrote a review Mar 2009,50,A luxury retreat amidst the hubub that is Marrakech,Marrakech is hectic noisy colourful loud and teeming with people donkey carts hand carts and mopeds.  What more could you want then than to step through a carved door (smiling at the mint seller permanently pitched outside) into an oasis where your every need is met immediately but discreetly. Where breakfast is served on the roof terrace while you watch the storks re -building their nest each day on the top of the mosque tower while listening to the muezzin calling the faithful to prayer. Where after breakfast you can go for a dip in the pool situated in the internal courtyard and gaze up at the ornate ceilings and North African patterns. Where you can both retire to the private Hamman and enjoy its indulgent pleasures. Where as night falls the riad turns into a candlelit wonderland when staff appear as if by magic should you need anything and bring you drinks once more on the roof terrace but this time you are lounging on immense sofas under a tented roof.  What more could you want? Oh yes an English couple who felt like your best friends by the end of the holiday. Nothing was too much trouble for Di and Nigel: computers medicines and advice were proffered immediately along with companionable chats.  We wanted a week’s break that gave us some winter sun plenty of rest but some local colour as well. This fitted the bill perfectly and our enormous thanks to every single member of staff who took so much trouble over us: to Salah who rustled up a meal for us when we arrived late(and served it with linen napkins and all the other silver service niceties); to the manager Nourdine who got us a guide helped us with our room safe and immediately fixed a light for me to the cleaners who were discreet and never tried to come in our room unless they were certain we would not be using it to Mohammed who served our breakfast and practised his English on us to the cook who made such beautiful meals (we had rose petals scattered over the table for our last dinner) and of course to Di and Nigel who made it all possible.

Nigel and Diane as well as Noureddin and all the staff couldn’t have been more pleasant helpful reliable and easy to get on with. The hotel is beautiful and its location is excellent just off a small busy square and on a street that leads straight to the main square.    Marrakech itself is a must-visit. It has several beautiful 12th to late 19th century buildings that show off splendidly the development of the sometimes dazzlingly rich style of Muslim decoration in stucco marble carved wood and ceramics. We also greatly enjoyed the extensive and fascinating markets the streets of the large old town (medina) and the stunning activity on Djema-el-Fna pulling you into another world. The people are genuinely friendly. We never felt unsafe anywhere (and we got around).    It was also great to be able to rely on a genuinely friendly welcome and willingness to attend to anything we might need literally every time we went through the door at Dar Anika at whatever hour. The complimentary private transfers from and to the airport were very much appreciated. Dar Anika also arranged for us a wonderful day trip to the mountains (Siti Fatma) with an excellent Berber driver/guide in a luxury car at reasonable cost.

Although the hotel is elegant quiet comfortable and peaceful it is really Diane Nigel and their staff who tip this place over the top. And although they are somehow completely unobtrusive about it your wish is their command! These are folks who will give you the change from their pockets to buy postcards who will give you STACKS of their own personal music collection to enjoy and I do believe that Nigel would give you the shirt off his back if you requested it. We were five friends and colleagues traveling together for a short break before buckling down to work in Casablanca.

This did not detract from the whole experience - plenty to do and lots of cosy places to eat and drink.  The welcome and service offered by the Riad were great - Di and Nigel and their team have got it just right incredibly helpful and friendly but not in your face. We were slightly limited with what we could do due to the impending birth on child No.2 but I know that Di and Nigel were full of recommendations about places to go outside of the City and spectacular walks to take in (maybe next time!). Nothing was too much trouble - recommending and booking restaurants helpful tips about where to go in the Souks and generally offering any assistance they could.  The Riad is in a fantastic location - at the end of a fascinating road which leads directly to the main square and also with some great restaurants and bars right ont he doorstep - higly recommend La Tanjia and the Kosy Bar - great food and lovely open fire to relax in front of (given our weather conditions this was most welcome!).  If we were to go back to Marrakech I would not think twice about staying at Dar Anika again.,Date of stay: March 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Buckinghamshire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Racheyp

Riad Dar Anika,traveltoofar wrote a review Jan 2009,50,Wonderful Riad,What a Riad! It was a wonderful experience spending our time at Dar Anika. Diane and Nigel the managers were especially helpful and lots of fun. They helped us with information such as restaurants sightseeing taxis drivers etc. The rooms are very clean and have the morrocan motif. There is a roof top terrace where we had drinks late at night overlooking the town. There's a dining room inside pool and having breakfast in the open air courtyard was a real treat. By far the customer service is top rated at this Riad. Do not spend your money staying at the large hotels. You will miss the ambience and truly the reason why you traveled all the way to Marrakech. The Riad is within close walking distance from the main square and equal walking distance to sights in the old city. All in all it was an excellent place to stay.,Date of stay: January 2009,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Shavano Park, Texas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveltoofar
Riad Dar Anika,MWombat wrote a review Jan 2009,50,Oasis in the Medina!,"The Dar Anika is a gem. The hosts are generous with their local knowledge and Nordeen their manager...well he has the most amazing ""fixer"" skills of anyone I've ever met in the hospitality profession! You name it Nordeen will get it done and make it seem effortless. The location is excellent: easily accessible from the taxi drop-off point good situation for some superb restaurants and tourist highlights. Our room was exceptionally quiet and the interior courtyard (used for dining in winter) was a very pleasant spot. The homemade yogurt/fresh fruit/bread selection was a treat for breakfast.

Riad Dar Anika,HelenJC wrote a review Jan 2009,50,Peaceful haven with wonderful hosts,My partner and I wanted an interesting city break and picked Marrakech. As there are over 600 Riads in the city we wanted to pick one that had the right mix of peacefullness good location and comfortable facilities. Riad Dar Anika certainly delivered this and much more. The location could not be better as it's only 5 minutes from the main square however once inside the doors it is so tranquil and a wonderful haven from the noise and bustle of the city. The Riad has been done up in very good style - not too Moroccan and with taste! Wonderful hand painted ceilings throughout which are a feat of artistry There is a pool and hamman and a lovely roof terrace with great views. We ate in the Riad on our last night and had lovely food. However the thing that just makes Dar Anika so special is the staff. Di and Nigel are just the perfect hosts - so warm professional and helpful - and great fun too! They have boundless knowledge of the city and surrounds and will really make your stay special. Nigel is a real foodie and is very knowledgable about all the restaurants which is useful! Their son also runs trips into the Atlas mountains which is a great contrast to the city. Nourredine the Manager and the rest of the staff are just lovely too - gracious and warm and eager to please! We had a wonderful time there and would thoroughly recommend it.,Date of stay: January 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Valencia, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelenJC
Riad Dar Anika,RichJT wrote a review Jan 2009,50,An oasis of calm in Marrakech,We have just returned from a short break in Marrakech staying at the Riad Dar Anika. We were given a warm welcome by the friendly staff and hosts Nigel and Diana and quickly settled into our room the guest suite.  The suite was spacious and luxurious with hand painted ceiling and a large dome above the bed. The lighting although very atmospheric was a little dim and it would have been nice to be have a bit more light. The room very tastefully decorated however the expanses of stone meant that it got quite cool in the early morning (not a problem when the weather warms up though!).  The rest of the Riad is beautifully laid out with a small pool hammam and plenty of room on the roof top terrace for sun bathing even in January. The breakfasts are fairly simple but satisfying and the fresh orange juice is a treat. We dined in once and the food traditional Moroccan fare was very good indeed.  The riad is ideally located just 5 mins from the main Jemaa El Fna square and lots of really good restaurants.  Overall Riad Dar Anika is a wonderful place to stay and enjoy all that fabulous Marrakech has to offer. And when you have had your fill of the souks and hustle and bustle you can close the door and step into an oasis of calm and tranquility that is Riad Dar Anika.,Date of stay: January 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Penn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichJT
Riad Dar Anika,Michelle3000 wrote a review Nov 2008,50,Fabulous!,Loved our stay at the Riad.    The two main attractions were the brilliant staff and the food!    Nothing was too much trouble for the staff including a middle of the night wake up for the Doctor and fetching the necessary medicine!! (Bug taken out with us by the way nothing to do with the food!)    The food was out of this world and if you are offered the last night special meal book it! Excellent value for money and the best food we had all holiday.    Unfortunately we weren't able to make much use of the terrace as the weather was against us but the fire in the dining room made up for it...

I loved the fact that we had an English couple running the hotel who could advise us of where to go and the best places to eat and the best sight seeing spots etc...  Nigel and Di were extremely friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them or their staff. The views from the terrace were breath taking and the hotel was immaculate.  The meals we also ate at the hotel were beautiful and set us up for the night life of the square in the evenings which you just have to see to believe.

Its a lovely place very clean and well laid out with a lovely roof terrace for breakfast. If I had some criticisms it would be breakfast needs some variety and a simple cooked option (eggs/toast) would be nice and we never ate there in the evening because you had to give notice during the by midday to order a meal for the evening.    Having said that it wasn't a problem we ate at plenty of lovely if slightly expensive restaurants that were near by or a short taxi ride.

Riad Dar Anika,haslemereblush wrote a review Oct 2008,50,A place of tranquility and peace,Dar Anika is an oasis of calm and tranquility within the Medina of Marrakech.

Nothing is too much trouble !    I took my teenage daughters who thoroughly enjoyed their first taste of Africa and the colour and atmosphere of Marrakesh.

This riad is really worth every penny from the amazing hospitality (thank you Diane Nigel Nordeen (I'm sorry I'm probably spelling your name wrong but you were awesome)) to the unpretentious luxuriousness the lovely breakfasts and the relaxed ambiance. I honestly have no complaints about this place. The team who work here were incredibly helpful and friendly but I was truly impressed by the smaller touches - the warm conversations over breakfast and the lovely mint tea and yummy pastries served anytime we wanted (someone actually was sweet enough to run to the market and buy fresh mint to prepare tea for us even though we were the only guests that night). Real class and service. I was blown away.

Riad Dar Anika,Ipswichguy1959 wrote a review Sep 2008,50,Great Hotel,I just got back from a very enjoyable stay at Dar Anika. Nigel and Di are excellent hosts always ready with advice and ever helpful. They sorted out a morning's horse riding and a fantastic day trip to the Atlas for me even taking me to the airport in the hotel van at the end of the stay. That's great hospitality!    The Riad is an almost new building so everything works fine has excellent staff and is well positioned. It's a real oasis of calm but also very handy for many of the medina sights. There is a taxi stand 50m away for those longer trips out.    The rooms are nicely decorated and well maintained with comfortable beds. It's traditional in style and very calm and relaxing. The terrace has a big tent for shade and plenty of sunbeds. I spent a day chilling out up there and the staff were excellent leaving me in peace but always available.    My case got broken just as i arrived at the door and the first thing Nigel said was that I could get it fixed up the road. At the time I thought 'yeah' but the next day I took a look in Riad Zitoun Kedim (the street the Da Anika is located in) and found a shop 200m away who charged me 50 Diram and fixed it in 24 hours!

We were collected from the airport and upon our arrival we were welcomed by Di and Nigel the English couple that run the riad with mint tea and pastries.    Throughout Di & Nigel were very helpful giving us advice and suggestions to anything we asked them - they even offered to buy some lamps on our behalf and get them shipped to us in the UK.    Our room was beautifully prepared and furnished. Despite its central location we found the riad pretty quiet. We had a plentiful breakfast on the terrace every day (up to midday if we wanted) and this along with the pool make the riad a very comfortable place to stay.

We watch the action outside from our bathroom window. We also ate dinner the first evening even after I ask pass the courtesy deadline. (Since this a small place they want you let them know early.)

Riad Dar Anika,AmandaBLondon_UK wrote a review Mar 2008,40,An oasis of Englishness,I have just returned from staying for 4 nights at Dar Anika a riad right in the centre of Marrakesh and run by Diane & Nigel who are charming helpful and fun hosts. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and the other guests were really friendly and lovely too. I went on my own but did not feel lonely at all. The food at Dar Anika is extremely good and it was great to be able to eat in when I felt like it rather than brave the jostling crowds in the Medina!  It was also great to have a pool to swim in and a roof terrace to sunbathe on both of which are quite private.  For me the main thing about Dar Anika was that the Moroccan culture is so different from ours that the riad represented an oasis of calm and a bit of England in the midst of a very foreign country. Because I was travelling on my own I found this very reassuring.  You can also have a traditional hamman and massage which I decided to try and again it was nice to remain within Dar Anika to try these out!

Riad Dar Anika,PST77 wrote a review Mar 2008,50,We'll Be Back ...,My wife and I were both excited and a little apprehensive about our first trip to Marrakech never having been to Africa before. During the short ride from the airport into the city it was obvious that this trip would be a cultural education. However as soon as Nordine opened the door to Riad Dar Anika with a broad and welcoming smile we immediately knew that we had at least made the right choice of accommodation.    Dar Anika is perfectly located within the medina but with vehicular access to just a few feet from the door. At the same time it is only a short walk to the Jemaa el Fna or “big square” the souks the Saadian Tombs and other must see attractions. Outside the door is all the hustle and bustle that you would expect in Morocco with street vendors donkey carts and local people going about their day to day business.    However behind the door to Dar Anika everything changes to a haven of calm and serenity. The riad has been recently built to a traditional Moroccan layout around a central courtyard which includes a small swimming pool. The design which you could call contemporary Moroccan has been carefully considered and gives you a true flavour of Morocco without being fussy or “themed”. Our room was extremely comfortable and well equipped including air conditioning a fridge and a hair dryer. The ensuite was lovely with no bath but a great shower. Most rooms only have windows onto the internal courtyard and are therefore quieter. However our room had windows onto the street outside which meant that we could hear the sounds of Marrakech from early in the morning. For us this was a plus point but others may prefer a quieter room.    Breakfast is taken on the rooftop terrace or in the salon on the ground floor. You can also arrange to have lunch or dinner in the riad. Breakfast is delicious and fresh and sets you up perfectly for a day exploring the city. Dinner prepared by Nordine’s wife was delicious and a real treat.    As nice as the riad is its biggest plus must be the management and staff. The hosts Diane and Nigel immediately make you feel like old friends and being English can give good advice to those haven’t been to Morocco before. All the staff are welcoming and friendly and obviously well trained. However a special mention must go to Nordine who looked after us so well during our stay.

Riad Dar Anika,Chillaxers wrote a review Mar 2008,50,An Absolute Gem!,My husband and I decided to book 3 nights at Riad Dar Anika last week after having read the TripAdvisor reviews. It was very much what we had hoped for… and more.    We were met and driven from the airport to the Riad as arranged by them. We weren’t quite sure what to expect when the driver stopped in a small busy square and took our bags out. We then walked about 50 yards to a beautiful door which was opened by a lovely soft-spoken gentleman Samir. When he led us in and shut the door behind us we had the most pleasant surprise – immediately there was just silence peace and serenity in the elegantly decorated surroundings. It was like entering a ‘tardis’ in the middle of all the hubbub of the city.    We were served mint tea in the lounge off the interior court whilst waiting for Samir to check us in. It was cool in contrast to the warmer temperature outside the Riad. The décor was just stunning – beautifully hand-crafted lamps mosaic marble floors delicately hand-painted ceilings and much more.    We had a good sized bedroom which was equally elegantly decorated plus a bonus of a small private courtyard. We had a fridge and a safe in the room. It was all very cosy and the whole time we were there we felt very safe and relaxed.    WiFi is available in the Riad so we were able to go online with our laptop or use the Riad’s laptop in the lounge.    They serve (healthy) breakfasts and (very tasty!) dinners on the roof terrace although you may choose to have meals elsewhere in the Riad. They have enough areas for guests to find peace and quiet should they wish.    We felt so relaxed at the Riad that we decided to stay in on the afternoon of our last day. I used the hammam and had a massage afterwards. Although the pool was heated I did not get a chance too use it. Since most of the guests were out we had the luxury of having the Riad to ourselves. We sat in the lounge drank mint tea listened to Arabic chill music and read books which were all available for the guests.    Riad Dar Anika fulfilled all our expectations – it was conveniently located a short walk away from the main square markets and restaurants. It was clean safe secure and serene. The staff were extremely helpful and pleasant – we could not have asked for more.    We will definitely stay there again.,Date of stay: February 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chillaxers
Riad Dar Anika,catcallsurrey wrote a review Mar 2008,40,Fusion feelings,As an A2 student I needed a half term break and so went with my Mum to Marrekech to chill and relax. I did just that. Everyone at Dar Anika was so helpful nothing was too much trouble. The weather was poor but we were so close to the centre of where everything happens in Marrekech that we just spent ages walking about and soaking up the atmosphere. The riad couldn't be in a better position and the roof terrace is an ideal viewing point!  It didn't matter that there was no-one else of my age at the hotel - everyone just got on well together - it must attract like-minded people - I certainly want to go back.,Date of stay: March 2008,,Surrey,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catcallsurrey

Riad Dar Anika,White-Adder wrote a review Feb 2008,50,Not to be missed!,"Just returned from a 4 night ""no hassle"" experience in Marrakech staying at the wonderful Riad Dar Anika. First time away without our son in 16 years so it had to be special and this Riad certainly didn't disappoint.    Riad Dar Anika has an understated elegance and is a calm oasis from the busy streets right outside the front door. The service was wonderful - the staff were always on hand when needed but not obtrusive.    It rained when we were there but that was just a good excuse for a fire in the lounge. Diane and Nigel thought of everything we needed with brollies by the front door.

Riad Dar Anika,d0678 wrote a review Jan 2008,50,A don't miss opportunity,"My fiance and I recently traveled to Morocco for a short break in Marrakech. This was to be a little city break slightly out of the norm we had no idea the huge impact the city would leave on our lives.    We chose to stay in a Riad a Boutique Hotel would best describe it. Nestled away in a shadowery corner of the bustling ""mellah"" DAR ANIKA opens its doors to reveal a modern  day Alladins cave of peace and tranquility.    Dar Anika is owned by a gregarious Brit Chris Gooding. His vision to build a traditional Riad with modern standards of craftsmanship and hospitality is inspired and  works beautifully.    Managed and run by a wonderful couple Di and Nigel they make certain your every whim and need is catered for.    The Riad boasts an open courtyard with a well proportioned pool and traditional Moroccan steam-room. The rooms are tastefully decorated and kept spotlessly clean.    The Riad offers a massage service to knead away the knots from a days hard haggling and with an endless supply of mint tee it's simply impossible not to unwind and relax in such comfortable surroundings.    Marrakech and Dar Anika is a wonderful destination for holiday out of the norm. The people are welcoming friendly and generous. You see local activities that date back to the dawn  of time but then turn round the corner and you'll find yourself in a world of modernity and extravagance. Marrakech simply has it all.    We were so well looked after and felt so comfortable in the Riad it could have almost been an extension of our own home.

Riad Dar Anika,miniboss2 wrote a review Jan 2008,50,A real gem in the heart of Marrakech,Our trip to Marrakech was brilliant and exceeded all our expectations. It was our first time but nevertheless we were happy to book directly with the Riad via e-mail which was all very easy as the Manager speaks fluent English. The journey from the airport was very straightforward the friendly driver met us at arrivals for a private transfer organised by the hotel. He took us right to the front door where we received a very warm welcome. After a brief tour of the very beautiful building we were served with complimentary mint tea-very refreshing & something we were to have many times over the next week!  The room was great very comfortable making it very easy to drop back into a lovely sleep after hearing the early morning call to prayer from the nearby mosque.  The food at the Riad served on the rooftop terrace was excellent. All the staff were brilliant very attentive and very friendly-nothing was too much trouble. They were happy to book restaurants for us and give us many tips on where to go and how to get there.  The location of the hotel was to us perfect-within the city walls and just a short walk from the Djemaa el Fna the pulsating main square.  To us though the 'icing on the cake' were the fantastic hosts Di and Nigel. They were always around to check all was well and to see if there was anything they could do to ensure our stay was perfect. They gave the place a real warmth and we now look on them as good friends who we are keen to go back and see very soon.,Date of stay: October 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Shoreham-by-Sea, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miniboss2

We were surprised by its peaceful ambience once we had made it through the chaos of the streets to get there. Rooms are done out in relly nice Moroccan style but not overdone. Staff are friendly and the cooking is great. Later in our stay there was a lamb eating festival. We ate our share!.    The riad is near the big bustling Jema el fnaa square with its busy night time activities and local eating.

Riad Dar Anika,visitor99 wrote a review Dec 2007,50,Arabian Nights,"If you arrive in Marrakech in daylight then delay your arrival at Dar Anika until after sunset.    Arriving by taxi in a chaotic little square on the edge of the medina with a kebab seller on one side of the recessed doorway to Dar Anika and a boistrous crowd outside a cafe opposite - together with 30/40 parked mopeds - the scene is no different from a suburb of any one of a wide number of middle eastern cities and the concern is that the hotel you have booked might match. However as soon as the studded door is opened and you catch your first glimpse of Dar Anika all worries fade away. The interior is decorated in a very arabian but tastefull style and lit almost exclusively by candles in traditional lanterns. Unlike many hotels and guesthouses you may stay at Dar Anika surpasses the images on its website.    Once inside the noise of the square outside dissapears and you have entered a haven of peace and tranquility something you will really cherish after days touring the souks and sites of Marrakech and its surrounds. Tranquil that is except for the nightly return in the early hours of a group also staying in the riad who seemed to think it necessary to shout at each other to communicate.    At first sight the road (wide alley is a better description of the main thoroughfares inside the medina) from the riad to the famous Djama El Fna seems rather threatening particularly on a Friday night when many of the ""shops"" (holes in walls) are closed and their metal doors shuttered. If it were in South London there is no way you would even consider walking along it at 10:00 at night but with past experience that such towns are indeed much safer than cities in the UK and the knowledge that over the past few yearsthe Morrocan Govt has made life in Marrakech much safer/hassle free for tourists we set off to explore the unique experience that is Djarma El Fna.    We didn't eat (other than breakfast) in the hotel as we wished to experience a number of different local restaurants (all excellent and you find it difficult to spend more than £25 per head for dinner wine and entertainment).    The souks are fascinating but it takes so long to negotiate down to the 25-30% of opening price that is what you really have to pay possibly less if you have patience that in the end you don't buy things you would really like as it is just too much hassle and time consuming. As for taxis always agree a price beforehand the 30% rule seems to apply here too and if you dont they will quote some lottery based number after the journey and bang goes another 10 minutes ""discussing"" what is an acceptable number.    The house staff Nordine and Samir are very helpfull. For example within minutes of asking they had arranged a driver and Land Cruiser for the day to take us across the Atlas mountains to Ait Benhaddou and two of its less famous but in some ways more stunning neighbours. £100 for the day.    In summary an excellent place to stay (did I mention that it is the only quality riad I could find on the net where the taxi can pull up outside the door and the taxi to and from the airport is provided by the hotel?)",Date of stay: November 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,England,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/visitor99
Riad Dar Anika,wanderwart wrote a review Nov 2007,50,House Party,Flew direct to Marrakech with Atlas Blue (old Royal Maroc). V. Good.    The Riad is beautifully tranquil from the moment one enters from the hustle and bustle that is Marrakech street life.  The decor is subtly Moroccan with a lot of marble and tiling. The ceilings have been beautifully hand painted.    We were greeted by Nigel Diane and Nordine with sweet mint tea and then shown to our room. We found the room perfect with a nice shower room en suite. There are 11 rooms of varying sizes each with its own character.    Meals are taken on the roof terrace with one long table for breakfast where all the house guests are able to meet each other which made for a very sociable stay. If the weathers cold theres a berber tent to eat in.    Habiba Nordines wife is the house cook and is wonderful. For Nigels birthday she made us a Moroccan banquet of traditional fare which took days of preparation.    The riad is about 5 minutes walk to the main square which becomes alive at night with snake charmers kebab restaurants and shops.    There are a few nice restaurants very near to the riad where we sampled great food and belly dancing.    People from other riads were jealous of Dar Anika! We had a fantastic 6 days of eatin drinkin (Moroccan wine is surprisingly very good) and sight seeing. Nordine or Samir will readily organise you a guide for a tour a cab tour or the open top bus stops outside every half hour.    The hammam and massage were also a new experience not to be missed.,Date of stay: November 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"southampton,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wanderwart

An oasis in the midst of the insanity with square Djemm el Fnaa only a few minutes away!    The staff are amazing and thoroughly courteous helpful and attentive. (Special mention to Nourreddine Fahd and Habiba...thank you again!) Breakfasts were great the chef's firm set yoghurt as good as it gets and with fresh fruit salad breads jams honey fresh orange juice and teas or coffees you'll be hard pushed to eat lunch......but we did salads and BBQ. First class.    We also had our evening meal there on our last night and it was truly excellent finishing with a most spectacular fruit display. The quantities were more than we could manage and so much care and attention had gone into the meal that we felt awful at not being able to finish every last scrap.    The Riad is certainly 'class' and all the care attention and love that has been central to it's development is apparent at every turn. It is very beautiful from the entrance hallway air conditioned reading/ CD/ relaxing area and separate pool on the ground floor right through the delightful accomodation on the first floor and onto the roof with the tables for breakfast the sun loungers (towels already in place) and the tented dining area with candles in the evening.,Date of stay: August 2007,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Leicester, Uk",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hugechurbes
Riad Dar Anika,florin119 wrote a review Jul 2007,50,Very comfortable and welcoming riad,Just returned from 4 nights in Morocco. We booked this riad based on recommendations on Trip Advisor. We were very pleased that we did. The riad is nicely presented the staff were very welcoming and very helpful. The staff were some of the most helpful that we've come across and we've stayed in quite a few places. The riad itself is very comfortable with a small but refreshing pool. In terms of location it is good. It's within the city walls and about a 10 minute walk from the main square. The walk itself is very interesting so for us was not a problem. The food in the riad was okay but we would recommend eating out as the atmoshpere in local resturants is better. It would also benefit from a couple of extra parasols for the roof top terrace.    We are pleased we stayed there and would recommend it to other travellers as a good base to explore the area from.

Riad Dar Anika,vjmspice wrote a review Jul 2007,50,Understated Decadence and Tranquility,I returned for the second time to Dar Anika in May of this year before the scorching weather arrived. I had visited the Riad when it first opened and found it a wonderful place and the return only added to and excelled my original thoughts. The staff were so helpful and their skills had been polished to a high degree and they were able to offer so much not only to the Riad itself but to the experience of Marrakech -of where to go and what to see.    The Riad itself is exceptionally clean the rooms are wonderfully cool even without the air conditioning the artwork is fantastic and the decor has been chosen with care and fits in fantastically.    The close proximity of the D'Jeema Al Fna (main square) was great too. With a slow stroll along what appears to be a rather wide alley but in fact turns out to be an access way for all sorts of transport you end up after a colourful experience at the Square.    I would highly recommend the Riad to anyone I know and given that I have now been there twice they are obviously doing something right.

Riad Dar Anika,Savannasouthampton wrote a review Jul 2007,40,Fabulous experience,We stayed at the Riad for 10 days and throughly enjoyed it. The location is brilliant because we could walk by ourseleves directly to the main Marrakech square which has got the most fabulous atmosphere especially at night. We found the Riad a calm oasis after the hussle of local life. The rooms are very comfortable which have traditional artwork on the ceilings along with air conditioning. The modern en suite had these lovely coloured glass windows which matched the ones in the room giving a lovely effect. All kept very clean by staff who were friendly and nothing was too much trouble. They have about 11 rooms which meant a very special personalised feel to it. Their recommendations for local resturants for lunch were first rate with excellent food at fair prices. The food at the Riad was superb and was served on the roof terrace which was really relaxed and then if we wanted we could go and sit for more drinks on comfortable seats in the Moroccon nights tent also on the roof terrace. It means you can sit and chat either by yourselves or with other guests if you wish.    What suprised us was how good the night life was. The Riad suggested some places to try and organised taxis for us they were taxis's they use all the time so we were not ripped off at all plus they could tell them exactly where we wanted to go so there was no language problem.    There is a great massage room which I can't remember what it's called but felt amazing afterwards!!!! Felt as though every dirty pore in my body had been thoroughly cleansed.    The Riad is beautifully done including a pool although not overly large is inside on ground level which enables you to cool off nicely with towels provided for you close to hand.    We loved how they have managed to retain that old traditional feel to the Riad but incorporating the modern things you need even down to a lap top left our for everyone's use It was so relaxing we could quite easily of stayed longer. We have bored all our friends about it and the amazing trip altogether. If your looking for somewhere to visit that combines very friendly hospitality excellent food and great experiences then we can recommend you go and stay at the Riad D'Anika we guarantee you wont be disapointed.    We are now organising to go back with a group of friends for a long weekend and can't wait!!!!,Date of stay: June 2007,,Southampton,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Savannasouthampton

The effective air conditioning really made a difference in this spare and elegant riad.    The staff and service levels are fantastic - nothing was too much trouble for Samir and his charming team.  We can thoroughly recommend eating at Dar Anika. Meals need to be booked by midday but the result is fantastic and an order of magnitude better than any other meal we had in Marrakech.    My only criticism is that the bathrooms were a little disappointing compared to the rest of the place. They are quite plain and basic - most rooms only have a shower.

Riad Dar Anika,helenj91 wrote a review May 2007,50,Loved it,Just got back from Riad Dar Anika and we loved it. They upgraded us to the suite which was an absolutely gorgeous room with a domed roof - it was a little dark but this added to the atmosphere. Breakfast was excellent really fresh and served on the roof terrace – although if you stayed for a longer time you may get a bit sick of the breakfast as it is pretty much the same each morning - bread jams yoghurt fruit coffee. We sunbathed on the roof one day and used the indoor / outdoor pool which was lovely. We also got the hotel to get someone in to do a hamam / treatment – this cost £12.50 per person. Basically you go into a marble steam room by the swimming pool and she covers you in olive soap then gives you a very good exfoliating followed by a mask and drenches you in lots of hot water in between. Your skin feels really smooth and lovely afterwards!    The hotel recommended a restaurant on the square called Marrakchi – traditional food belly dancers etc. It was by far our best meal and it’s one of the few places on the square that serves alcohol. The wine was really nice and reasonably priced too! They also recommend a restaurant right near the hotel (I think it was called Tangia) – the place was impressive/traditional etc but the food was pretty average. Our worst meal was at Bo Zin – a very trendy restaurant / bar / music place out of town. The décor / atmosphere etc was fab but the food was not very nice – it was cold and the service was pretty rubbish. We still had a good time though! There is another place nearby called Dar Soukkar which is meant to be good so we wish we’d gone there instead. We also went to Le Comptoir which is another restaurant / bar / music place on the edge of the Medina. It was a great place to go for cocktails and we wish we had eaten there as the food looked great.    We also went up into the Atlas Mountains which is a must. The hotel quoted us £80 but another hotel guest recommended a private taxi / guide called Omar – he took us for £40 and he was excellent. He spoke great English and he was with us for the whole day and even combined the mountain trip with a city tour at the end of the day – his number is [--].    I’d definitely recommend Marrakech and Dar Anika.,Date of stay: May 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Altrincham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helenj91
Riad Dar Anika,moonbather wrote a review Apr 2007,40,loved marrakech,We returned last week from a three night stay at the Dar Anika. I had booked the trip as a Christmas present for my husband and became a little worried just prior to travelling as there were several low rated reviews. I e-mailed the hotel and was assured the towel/bathrobe problem had been sorted.    We were collected at the airport as arranged be ready for a long wait in line for customs when you arrive. Upon arrival at the Riad we were given a cup of mint tea and shown around the Riad and then to our room. We were in a room just off the pool area it was a superior room and was a good size. The bed was very comfortable and the shower was surprisingly good better than many we have experienced during our travels! The towels were fine we had no bath towels on the first nights however these appeared on the second day although we had never requested them. We had water and fresh flowers in our room but the fruit and moroccan pastries which were advertised never materialised we never did mention this although I suppose we should have.    The weather was beautiful on our first morning and breakfas was served on the rooftop terrace. Each morning this consisted of coffee/tea very fresh orange juice lovely fresh bread and another cake/pastry a selection of jams/honey and a bowl of yogurt (the nicest we've ever tasted) and a bowl of fresh fruit. It was loevely having breakfast in the sunshine unfortunately the weather on the next two mornsing was not so good and we were served it in a room downstairs.    The riad is as many have said perfectly located we never got lost finding our way back. Be aware though it is very easy to get lost in Marrakech especially when wondering around the souks we did frequently and ended up following someone who offered to show us the way. They do expect to be paid for this and we discovered that however much you offer at first they ask for more. This did not worry us too much after all the standard of living there is poor I think we read the minimum wage is 30p an hour!    We ate on the square one night this was quite an experience and I considered myself very brave to try it the food was okay but the atmosphere was incredible never seen so many people eating al fresco! On the second night we ate at a restaurant recommended by the Riad near the squrae can't remember its name but we had a great night with belly dancers and morrocan music. On our last night we asked the Riad to book a table at 'Narwama' as we had read reviews and thought it sounded good. We got lost on our way again - be aware we follwed the signs but missed the final turn that night we walked into a restaurant and had ordered our food before we realised we were in the wrong one! We did turn the corner after our meal and apologised at the Narwama explaining what had happened and drank cocktails. It was a shame we missing the dining experience there as it looked superb!    A couple of tips: we wanted to go to the Bains de Marrakech but couldnt get booked in apparently they book up well in advance so book before you go if you plan to go there. We went to Hammam Ziani instead which is just around the corner from the Riad. This was much cheaper separate mens and ladies but was a very different but very relaxing experience where else can you have a gommage (exfoliation) steam room massage algae wrap for 20 pounds? We found a lovely bar on the square just near the hotel can't remember waht it was called but this was a lovely place to sit at the end of the day on the roof and people watch.    To finish I never felt unsafe in Marrakech but would recommend that you keep your shoulders and knees covered in the old town to avoid unnecessary stares and attention the moroccan culture is that women dress conservatively.    One other point to note at duty free in Marrakech airport they will NOT accept the dirham only euros.

You Won't Be Disappointed!,Can't really add much from the previous reviewer's comments only to re-itterate that we had a very enjoyable 3 night 4 day stay at the Riad Dar Anika in Marrakesh.    We stayed in a first floor superior room which we thought was great value for around 100GBP per night including breakfast. Breakfast was simple but adequate consisting of fruit yoghurt breads jams and as much mint tea as you can handle.    The Manager was really helpful in booking us a guide for half a day and recommending excellent local restaurants. There is a place just around the corner called 'Tangine' which had delicious food - definately recommended.    The location of the riad cannot be beaten as it is just a 5 minute walk to the big square. We certainly felt safe when venturing out alone at night as there is always people out and about.    Overall a 10/10 experience at the Dar Anika and I would recommend others to stay here for an authentic Moroccon experience.,Date of stay: April 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shazza_h
Riad Dar Anika,ACS81 wrote a review Apr 2007,50,"A must, would highly recommend!!!",After searching the 1000's of Riads in Marrakech we came across Dar Anika. I was taken by it because of its English owners true Moroccan style but newly built and its location.    After having just come back from 3N/4D's there I am thrilled that we chose this Riad.    We stayed in a Superior room on the 1st floor and paid about £100 a night.    The experience was fantastic we were greeted at the airport and driven directly to the Riads front door - a luxury in Marrakech - then led into the Riads relaxing Lounge to drink mint tea while our bags were taken to our room.    We were then left to our own devises but with staff constantly on hand to answer questions or get you more mint tea!    Other travellers have commented on the 4am alarm clock with the call to prayer from the mosque across the road - this may put you off but I wouldn’t let it! It is all part of the charm and attraction of Marrakech!    Also note peoples comments about towels and robes - ours were all white and in perfect condition - if this is an issue for people!!    Dar Anika really is in a fantastic location - turn left and you are 5minutes walk from the main square turn right and you are 5minutes walk from the Kasbah - couldn't be better.    What more can I say - take a trip to Dar Anika!!,Date of stay: March 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Notts,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ACS81

Riad Dar Anika,jiffinsky wrote a review Mar 2007,50,Georgeous and prime location,"Out of what seemed like hundreds of riads to choose from I am so glad that I settled on Riad Dar Anika.  It is a little more pricey but the quality and attention to every detail make up for it. Samir listened intently to my crazy brother and all of his far out ideas and made suggestions based on our interests. He  arranged everything we asked for. Absolutely everything was taken care of. The Riad itself is so peaceful and relaxing not to mention georgeously decorated top to bottom.  Only a few complaints: we waited over an hour at the train station to be picked up the pool was freezing cold (I picked the Riad for the ""warm pool"") and the towels and bathrobes were very worn and tattered.  A few tips:  Venture out to side streets where there aren't too many tourists- the venders were more eager to get their stuff sold out there.  Once you do the Jemma el Fna the tombs and the palace there isn't much left to Marrakech. Don't do the bus tours- all they do is take you around to see the hotels on the outskirts of the city and charge 130 dirhams to do it.    If you are looking for a quiet place to stay in a fab location and get pampered then stay here. It's not the place for kids or rowdy and loud travellers. My brother got a little loud one night after downing a lot of moroccan red wine (must try it) and got told to go to sleep now!  Oh and eat dinner up on the terrace at least one night- private beautifully decorated and the food is amazing- lamb Mmmmm.",Date of stay: February 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Edmonton,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jiffinsky
Riad Dar Anika,AnneNorris wrote a review Feb 2007,40,Super riad but room for improvement,Just returned from the lovely peaceful Dar Anika. Our superior larger room was well decorated in typical Moroccan style and very romantic. Shame about the dull towels and robes. Staff always on hand but we were disappointed not to be met on arrival at the airport. We had no expanation of what had gone wrong and we ended up paying too much for the taxi fare and paid even more to have our luggage placed in a barrow to be marched around the block back to where the taxi had left us right outside the riad!!!. The locals are extremely friendly but we always felt that they were trying to get as much money as they could out of us. We found a great taxi driver to take us to the Atlas mountains for the day for 600 dhms ( £38 ). Oujhain Abderrahman Grand Taxi number 526. Great guy who also took us to supermarket to buy wine and back to airport on last day. Highlight of the holiday was the trip to the Ourika valley. he took us to a Kasbah to the waterfalls to a Berber house and a lovely restaurant for lunch called Ramuntcho. Beautiful food with a spectacular dining terrace.  On the subject of food the meals at the riad were just okay nothing to rave about. After 5 days breakfasts had become boring same fruit yogurt bread and jams the only variation was the type of crumpety thing. Evening meal okay on quality but lacking in quantity at times.  We thought that the roof terrace was delightful a lovely place to dine especially with the portable heaters that were provided on chilly evenings. The staff were only too happy to give us a lunch on the terrace instead of the evening meal. Good quality wine at £10 a bottle but beware of the small local beers at nearly £4 each!!  Really enjoyed bartering in the souks. As a general rule we found that you should start by offering a quarter of what they ask. Never go more than a third of what they ask and just walk away with a smile and a laugh if they wont deal. You will see plenty more of the same item and you can always go back! Tip - take bubble wrap with you if you intend to buy pottery.  Overall a super holiday but if you go to Marrakech you must be prepared for the extreme poverty everywhere you go. I was quite shocked when dining in the square to be asked by a beggar for the food that I had left on my plate a half eaten piece of fish.,Date of stay: February 2007,,North Wales,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnneNorris
Riad Dar Anika,monenaManchester wrote a review Feb 2007,40,convinent location,Stayed at this hotel in February 2007 for 4 nights. Initally in the Riad room but this room was very hot being next to Hammam so transfered to the Suite. The Riad room also did not have a natural light as the window in the room was getting light from the adjecent hammam room.  The suite was excellent and very roomy although twice the price of the Riad room. The staff were friendly polite and very helpful. The food was excellent breakfast was served on the roof terrace but you had to be up early to get a table otherwise you had to eat inside the riad.  The riad was centrally located and very easy access to the main attractions.,Date of stay: February 2007,,"Sydney, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monenaManchester
Riad Dar Anika,lambley wrote a review Feb 2007,40,Not perfect but good..,I won't repeat all that other recent reviewers have said but will try to offer some extra comments.  The riad is in an excellent position for walking to Djanna el Fnaa though the road outside is very narrow and very busy with mopeds bikes hawkers donkey carts and pedestrians so you need to have your wits about you as you walk there. It is also in easy walking distance of the Saadian Tombs and Badi Palace though this was closed during our visit. A taxi rank is just over the road in Place Ferblantiers - though again the road is difficult to cross as cars taxis caleches tour buses and lorries now add to the excitement. Despite arriving mid-morning our rooms were ready and we were welcomed with a coffee. The standard rooms are a bit small but clean and perfectly adequate. My only criticisms being the poor lighting and the really tatty towels and bathrobes which were frayed and an unpleasant shade of grey and clearly in short supply as we rarely received our full quota each day. Not good enough! We breakfasted on the terrace each morning on fresh fruit breads jam and delicious yoghurt. We ate dinner at the riad only once and here I must disagree with previous reviewers. We found the food to be dull tasteless and over-priced compared to nearby restaurants - I recommend Le Tangia in Place Ferblantiers. It has a rooftop bar and a very stylish restaurant below ([---]). Bars are hard to find but there is also another stylish rooftop bar in the pedestrian part of the square. The riad will organise day trips for you or negotiate directly with a grand taxi for a better price. The Ourika Valley is popular with drivers as they have clearly got a deal with the restaurants and shops there but you can cut your lunch bill by half if you walk down from the taxi point - I think the Asgaour was where we ate an excellent tagine. There is quite a scramble up to the waterfalls so wear good shoes and hire a guide as they know exactly where you should tread to avoid slips. An alternative is to hire a grand-taxi to Imlil in the High Atlas which is quieter and has the most spectacular views. For trips round Marrakech I suggest a caleche which can be hired very reasonably by the hour. Our 2 hours cost 400 dirhams between four of us!

Riad Dar Anika,frankie72 wrote a review Feb 2007,50,review by two aussie vets in UK,I took my girlfriend for a romantic birthday weekend and this place was perfect for us. First the level of service and cleanliness is top class. Friendly and welcoming the minute the door opened. We had a few bottles of wine (160.00 Dirham note alcohol is not freely available outside the hotel) and the quality was very good. Plus it was nice to relax in the hotel with its beautiful decor and a bottle of good wine (liked by aussie tastes). We had a massage each for 400 Dirham which was ok and relaxing but not the strong enough for my liking. The restaurant meal was 350 Dirham each. The entree and main meal was very filling and very good quality. We found the desert a little uninspiring being apple surrounded in a puff pastry. although I am being a little harsh as the rest of the meal was excellent.  Location is great in fact the best bargains we got were in the street of the hotel which is about 600 meters from the main square and souks.  All the other guest thought it was nice as well and all reported the rooms were excellent. It has no kids play area so this is more suited for adults in fact kids may find it a bit boring. It maybe a little on the pricey side but the quality is top notch. Would go back again.,Date of stay: January 2007,,Dorking,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frankie72

Riad Dar Anika,Gordon H wrote a review Feb 2007,50,Riad Dar Anika for a peaceful retreat,"We selected Riad Dar Anika after reading the reviews on this site and were not disappointed.  The Riad is a fairly new building built in traditional style. It is in a good location and inside is breathtaking particularly at night when the public areas are candlelit. We had dinner on our first night served in the salon. We were the only diners and my wife said she felt like ""a queen in her palace"".  The food was the best we had in Marrakesh (and the most expensive but worth it)  Staff were friendly and very helpful.  We have both just retired and although located at the end of a narrow passageway we never felt threatened when strolling around even late at night.  Four days was enough for us and we had time for a facinating trip to the Atlas Mountains arranged by the Riad.",,,The Cotswolds,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GordonH
Riad Dar Anika,jaishree wrote a review Feb 2007,50,Cosy Dar Anika,We stayed in Dar Anika for 3 nights from 1-3 Feb 2007. We then stayed in Riad L'Orangeraie for 2 nights. I was in a group of 7 people of different ages and i think our impressions of Marrakech and the Riads varied quite a lot. I loved the Riads - I liked the fact that the riads were on dusty bustling roads and the doors to the riads opened into an oasis of calm. However older members of our group were less impressed although safe to say Marrakech and the riads grew on them by the end of the trip.  Dar Anika is in a good location for walking to the main square - it is about 7-8 minutes walk although the lane is quite deserted at night (but totally safe). My first impression of Dar Anika was the bustling street with donkeys and craftsmen surrounding the door to the Riad- for me it all added to the atmosphere. When I walked in I was struck at the peace calm and beauty of the Riad. It was very cosy and welcoming and the staff especially made it a great stay. The rooms were lovely. They were low lit which suited me fine but some of the older members of the group found them a bit dark. The terrace was nice but it was too cold to eat breakfast or dinner there. The dinner on the first night was fine and a good choice given that we didn't want to start wandering around the medina looking for a restaurant when we hadn't yet got our bearings. We really enjoyed sitting in the salon having a drink and chatting to the staff . They were happy for us to bring our own alcohol although you can get beer/wine at the Riad. The Riad is ideal for couples and I thought the decor lighting and pool added to the atmosphere. The indoor pool is a lovely feature in the Riad although it was too cold to swim as it was never really heated (although a few of our group did use it!). Overall it is a fantastic riad with amazing decor and features - I would highly recommend it. One thing to mention is the daily 545am call from the mosque. Now some reviewers have suggested that this adds to the atmosphere and was a minor concern. By the end of the holiday I would (mostly) agree but each morning the call was a 20 minute speech/sermon (one of the Riad managers told me that the morning call was not just the usual call to prayer which you hear throughout the day but was more like a sermon). And on the first night I was shocked at how loud and startling it was - probably because there is a speaker on the road right outside our room (6). If you do not mind being woken at 545 every morning then fine but I wouldn't say that it adds to the romance. But to keep this balanced my parents in the suite on the ground floor at the other side of the Riad (room 7 I think) hardly heard it. But I think this happens in every Riad in the medina so it is not particular to this riad.,Date of stay: February 2007,,london,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaishree

Riad Dar Anika,MILROYM wrote a review Dec 2006,40,Great Riad,Stayed at Riad Dar Anika for 7 nights last week and had a really fantastic time. The Riad is very nice good rooms great bathrooms excellent roof terrace and fantastic breakfast. The location is also excellent as it is a short walk to the main square but very accessible for cars etc so easy to unload luggage.    The only downside was that you do get woken by the local mosque (although arguably this is adds to the 'romance'). However we did get woken every morning by the staff arriving at 7am and they did proceed to clatter around talk clean etc which is not ideal if you are trying to relax and have a few lie ins. It wasn't the end of the world though.    We ate dinner in the hotel the first night and the food was excellent although pricy at 350dh (£22) per head. You can definatley get much better deals elsewhere but it was perfect as we were tired when we arrived so worked well.    All in all the Riad is in an excellent location with good food and very friendly (if not somewhat noisy in the morning) staff. I would definately recommend staying here.,Date of stay: December 2006,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MILROYM
Riad Dar Anika,KRPT wrote a review Dec 2006,50,"Wow, amazing",Wow what an experience! The riad is wonderfully modern in all the right areas such as the plumbing and electrics yet traditional in all the architecture and charm! Food is easily the best we tasted in Marrakech so save you time and effort looking elsewhere and concentrate on shopping! Wifi is definitely a big plus and the easy access by car is another bonus. The staff could not be more helpful and we are already planning our return trip. What more can we say except for the fear of this secret leaking out and no room for us when we want to go again next time!    The only down side just to make this a balanced review is the very close proximity to a nearby mosque that you have to get used to the wake up call for prayer 4 o'clock every morning! It is almost unavoidable in Marrakech and it is part of the experience of such a wonder place!,Date of stay: November 2006,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KRPT
Riad Dar Anika,HappyMarc wrote a review Nov 2006,50,Superb - I'm going back,This place is really outstanding very clean and the service is really 5 star. You can get a decent english tea with breakfast and they seem to find a beer when ever I wanted one. You wouldn't know the place was modern except for the proper electrics WiFi and air conditioning. It is very quiet but there is music in the salon (very tastefull naturally - Buddha bar and Arabic lounge!). The food is as good as any so eat in if you can. The locatioin means that the taxi will stop outside too (10 Euros from the airport the hotel arranged the pickup). The walk to the square is 5 minutes and shopping is a dream from here as ou can go back and drop stuff off and go out again.,Date of stay: November 2006,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Arlesey, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyMarc
Riad Dar Anika,saffier wrote a review Oct 2006,50,honeymoon,Myself and husband wanted a honeymoon destination different to anywhere else either of us had ever visited before and certainly couldn't have asked for more than Marrakech! And how fortunate that i came across the website for Riad Dar Anika. we were greeted at the airport by our driver and whilst driving through the mayhem of the medina we did wonder what we had let ourselves in for what with all the hustle and bustle of people mopeds donkey and carts but when through the doors of the Riad to be confronted by the stunning coolcalm courtyard of the Riad we new we couldn't have wanted for better. We were shown around by Madeline and then to our room; the suite with its beautiful domed ceiling. Having informed her in advance that our visit was our honeymoon we were delighted to find a bottle of rose wine on ice and the large bed adorned with heart shaped rose petals. The same thoughtful service continued for the duration of our stay.The staff were fantastic and just couldn't do enough for us. Highlights for us include sitting on the rooftop terrace at dusk with a beer watching the Storks circling around above our heads waiting for the Fast of Ramadan to be brought to an end by the calling of the Muezzins that echoed all around us. And then as people scurried to eat and break the Fast we would walk up the now deserted alleyway to the Jmaa el Fna. That first sight as we came through the archway was breathtaking-lights smells colour noise. Marrakech is a city of extremes but enjoyed every minute of our stay and Riad Dar Anika was the most perfect romantic accomadation.,Date of stay: October 2006,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,london,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saffier

Amazingly attentive staff - Madeline and her team really couldn't do enough for us they were there with a smile whenever you needed them but were so discreet. A room for every occasion - from the air conditioned room with music and laptop to the breakfast terrace and sun loungers through to the cooling rooftop tent with the comfiest sofas in the world!!

Riad Dar Anika,Robena wrote a review Aug 2006,50,tranquility and service,We were absolutely delighted with our week's stay at the Dar Anika. It was a tranquil haven to return to after a hard day haggling in the souks. We were no sooner through the door than in the pool. Ah! And the charming staff on hand to offer drinks. I could get used to this.  This is a newly built riad on the traditional design - so all the benefits (pool a/croof terrace) with none of the disadvantages of an old building. It's in the medina on a main pedestrian street to the square so you don't get lost (much!) The bedrooms and lounge were refreshingly air conditioned. (Lap-top or soothing CDs available in lounge. No TV. Bliss.)  The staff were all friendly (but not too friendly) and obliging. Madeleine is English and extremely helpful.  It was spotlessly clean with fresh flowers in the room. Lovely touches - candles round pool and along balconies after dark. Attractively decorated. Stained glass windows painted ceilings moroccan lamps.  A substantial breakfast of fresh fruit salad yoghurt moroccan pancakes crumpety things and french bread was served either on the roof terrace or the a/c lounge or in the luxurious tent (see their website!) on the roof depending on your preference. They also managed to somehow keep the guests mostly separate so we felt as if this was our own house complete with unobtrusive servants ready to do our every bidding.  Sunbathing (a bit too hot in July except late in the day) on the roof terrace. Hammam in house and a masseuse on request.  It is unusual in a riad in that you can drive almost to the front door so no problems with transfering luggage. We were met from the airport by a driver who took us on other trips during the week and was always absolutely on time.,,,"London, England",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robena
Riad Dar Anika,Martin D wrote a review Jul 2006,50,Great location with discreet and attentive service,We stumbled across the website for Dar Anika whilst looking for a riad in which to stay and were drawn by the peace and quiet that this riad promised. We were slightly reticent about booking as the property was new and had no online reviews although it is obviously being marketed as an upmarket riad as it appears on several other websites. The British ownership however put our minds at ease.    It is situated in a prime position close to several attractions (including the open top Marrakech Tour bus stop – although this is an eyesore not an attraction!) and is accessible by road. It is also at the start (or end) of a busy footpath that takes you straight to the Jemma El Fna (approx 10 minutes); mind the mopeds! In contrast to the noise and commotion in the street it is a place of peace and calm once you step through the heavy front door.    The service is impeccable with discreet and attentive service. This is a result I’m sure of the high levels of professionalism with which the British manager runs the place.    The room price included a healthy breakfast of fruit yoghurt and a variety of local breads. We also opted for the evening meal which to my mind included some of the best Moroccan food I have ever tasted! I particularly liked the beef tajine with almonds and prunes (had it twice). This British run riad prides itself on meals that are prepared hygienically and to very high standards.    As is the nature of riads the bedrooms are quite dark and even with all the lights on we found it a struggle to read. We did have a small patio area however that was outside (not suitable to sun bathe due to high walls) and pleasant to sit in.    A note of caution. For most North Europeans July and August is far too hot. For several days during our stay the temperature was in the low to mid forties with occasional sand-filled thunderstorms (see picture - this is desert country). If you have been to Marrakech before and just want to relax by the pool it is fine but if it is your first time temperatures like this sap your energy and make casual sightseeing very uncomfortable.,Date of stay: July 2006,Trip type: Traveled on business,xxx,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/null
