Riad Melhoun & Spa,Nina P wrote a review Feb 2022,50,Beautiful Riad in the heart of Marrakech and the Best staff,How do I even begin to describe such a beautiful riad in a country where you felt so much at home? Morocco has been on my bucket list for sometime so I braved travelling during Covid time dragged the parentals along with me and flew to Marrakech on Nov 2021. Our adventure began at Riad Melhoun where we met the most amazing staff who went above and beyond during our short stay. From airport pick up to checking in everything was seamless. I will never forget the smell of Jasmine upon entering the riad; such a wonderful scent to have on the lobby. The riad itself is beautiful-- decorated with traditional Moroccan designs. It was an oasis in the middle of the medina. We stayed in the two rooms at the very top and it was very peaceful -- a sanctuary in the midst of the medina and the bustling Djemaa El Fna.    Dinner at the riad is also a must-- all the dishes served were just so delicious and appetizing! Kudos to Ahmed Khadija and Anass for that amazing first dinner we had in Marrakech. A wonderful evening of Moroccan gastronomy. Massage was also so good especially coming from a long haul flight. Thank you to Asmaa and Oumaima for giving us such a relaxing massage.    Everything about this riad is beautiful but the ones that really shine and the real gem of this beautiful riad are its amazing staff. At the end of our trip we have found friends in each one of them. They are one of the reasons why we love Morocco so much! Thank you-- Nour Tarik Ahmed Khadija Ghizlane Anass and Mohamed for all that you do. You are all amazing. You are the real treasure of this beautiful riad. Memories we had in Morocco were surely one for the books. We'll keep coming back to you InshaAllah :),Date of stay: November 2021,,"Calgary, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nins821
Riad Melhoun & Spa,Mdurian wrote a review Mar 25,50,Stunningly renovated riad boutique hotel near Bahia Palace,We were a family of five (three generations) who stayed in two rooms. The place is meticulously restored and a work of art. We had one suite (gaya) and another normal room. The bathrooms are large and the gaya suite is good sized whereas the normal room was fairly modestly sized but all very cosy and comfortable. Great breakfast and superb service. The common spaces (ground floor and roof top) are amazing.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mdurian

The Riad is located in a peaceful part of the Medina right next to Bahia palace. We stayed in the spacious Gaia suite with our 9 year old son and my elderly parents stayed in the Maysar suite which was a little smaller but just as luxurious.    The staff was incredible. They did everything to make our stay more comfortable and easy. We loved the delicious breakfasts the Hamams and the tonic massage treatments.

Riad Melhoun & Spa,Shauna M wrote a review Mar 13,50,"Beautiful, Romantic Oasis in the Heart of Marrakesh <3",Where to begin to say we enjoyed our stay at the Riad Melhoun & Spa would be an huge understatement. We simply fell in love with the riad service offered food and overall ambience of what i would say is more boutique style establishment. Everything from the suite to the interior decor to the outdoor terrace is just unbelievably considered and beautiful. We enjoyed three nights earlier this month and we're made feel like we were the only guests at the Riad the entire time which only added to the experience. There was other guests we did see during our stay however the tranquil calm energy of the Riad just made you feel so relaxed and peaceful it was honestly one of the most relaxing city breaks we've ever had. Close enough to the hustle and excitement of the Medina streets but a real oasis of calm within The Medina. Breakfast served is a delightful addition to the stay i particularly recommend the omelette and the mint tea served here really is the best in Marrakesh. The riad was accommodating in arranging wine for us on request which we enjoyed with Lunch and dinner at the hotel something we were hesitant about our stay however found no issues in this area. Lastly the heated pool on the terrace brought me so much joy enjoying an evening dip with my partner after a heavy day in the souks was just the perfect way to end each day. Will recommend this Riad to all i know wishing to pay Marrakesh a visit honestly one of the nicest stays i've had in a long time. Thank you to all the wonderful staff and people of Marrakesh for the perfect city break <3,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/144shaunam
Riad Melhoun & Spa,Sandrycka wrote a review Mar 12,50,"Beautiful place, top level service!",The Riad was amazing. Very beautiful and exclusive with very few guests at once. Due to this the staff are extremely customer focused kind and will always try their best to keep you happy which they always will. Choose where to breakfast whether its at the top terrace with some nice sun or by the bottom pool same with lunch and dinner. Very tasty food and fresh juice hard to be disappointed here.

We were 3 adult family members and our suite was comfortable. The rooftop space with heated pool was lovely and we had breakfast each day on the rooftop terrace. On our last night we had a superb dinner in the courtyard with delicious Moroccan wine! We enjoyed the spa for facials and foot massages after returning from our Atlas Mountains trek. The Riad also arranged a city guide for us who was excellent and gave us recommendations and arranged reservations for other dinners out. We will recommend Riad Melhoun to all of our traveling friends!!,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Windham, Maine",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShariBLM
Riad Melhoun & Spa,Suleman V wrote a review Mar 10,50,Worldtraveler999,This quaint Riad is in a great location. We had a wonderful time during our 3-night stay. When we arrived we were given a reception with some snacks with Moroccan tea. Our room was clean and elegantly decorated. We cannot say enough good things about the amazing staff at this Riad. They made us feel special every single time we encountered any one of them - whether in the reception area or at meal times. There is a rooftop area with a hot tub and lounge chairs. We enjoyed having dinner and breakfast on the roof top dining area. After extending our checkout time by 2 hours we still had 3 hours before we departed. They let us stay in the main lounge and served us tea twice. We look forward to staying here during our next visit to Marrakesh.,Date of stay: March 2023,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sulemanv2023
Riad Melhoun & Spa,Juliette wrote a review Mar 8,50,Wonderful & welcoming place,I had a wonderful stay at Riad Melhoun - would be so happy to go again and will definitely recommend it to others.    The service was incredible and felt so personal - with assistance in organizing the arrival a very warm welcome checking in to make sure I had everything I needed and even noting small details like food /drinks preferences. They made me feel like a princess :)    The location is convenient right at the entrance to the Medina - central yet quiet. It also felt like a safe place for a woman traveling solo. The riad itself is really beautiful and well looked after too. The rooftop terrace & plunge pool are definitely a plus.    I can also highly recommend the dinner option. It was better and probably more authentic than the food I had at the restaurants. Plus it came with a background story which allowed me to get a glimpse into the culture.,Date of stay: March 2023,,"Zurich, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliettelionheart

The hot tub on the roof terrace was an extra bonus! I can't say enough about the service - everyone at the riad was welcoming and gracious with great advice when we needed it. The riad is quiet - away from the crazier areas of the Medina but close enough to wonderful restaurants (we especially liked Naranj) and Bahia Palace.

Riad Melhoun & Spa,David G wrote a review Jan 2023,50,An excellent experience!,We spent five nights over Christmas with the wonderful people at Riad Melhoun. Really an excellent experience. The property is easy to access either to explore the Medina or to go elsewhere in Marrakech. Breakfast every day was excellent and the one dinner we had there was superb. We took almost all our meals on the rooftop which is very comfortable and relaxing. The entire place is stylishly decorated so much so that we held a previously scheduled photo shoot at the Riad instead of elsewhere in the Medina. We also made use of the hammam and massage service. Both were very relaxing. Best of all though were the people who saw to every detail in such an efficient and easygoing way. They truly made the experience five stars. So overall I highly recommend Riad Melhoun and would stay there again in a heartbeat.,Date of stay: December 2022,,"Bend, Oregon",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DSG2024

Riad Melhoun & Spa,Nick D wrote a review Jan 2023,50,Fabulous place to stay in old Marrakech,We stayed in Riad Melhoun over my wife's birthday earlier this month. The riad is in great condition and is very well equipped. It is really well situated near to the square in the Jewish quarter and only 10 minutes interesting walk down narrow streets from the better known main square in Marrakech.    The staff at the riad are all very friendly and helpful; nothing is too much trouble for them and if they can make your day easier or more pleasurable then they will. They have a real family feel to their culture and will for example readily stay late to help each other out even after a long shift. They efficiently pass on relevant information about guests and their requirements when they go off duty which means that nothing falls between two stools. Someone from the team noticed from her passport that it was my wife’s birthday while we were there and a nice bunch of roses appeared in the room. It was a really nice and thoughtful touch.    In a place like Marrakech which is so culturally different from the UK or in our case France reliable advice is highly desirable and whoever at the riad is on reception at the time you will get all the advice and help you need. They are definitely on your side. Oh and the food is good too!    Would I stay there again on a future visit? Definitely.,Date of stay: January 2023,,"Maureillas-las-Illas, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/47nickd

Riad Melhoun & Spa,N8572JTlaurenh wrote a review Jan 2023,50,A Riad Above and Beyond All the Others!,Riad Melhoun was one of the best places we've ever stayed. From the moment you walk in the staff greets you warmly serves you delicious mint tea and helps you relax after a long journey. The smells of the riad transport you to another world--mixed with jasmine spices and other amazing scents you feel like you are in one of the most amazing places ever. The rooms and beds were super comfortable there was a working safe to secure important docs and there were rose petals welcoming us in the room. We had dinner at the riad our first night and it was one of the best meals of our trip to Morocco. We highly recommend having dinner there for at least one night! The breakfasts were amazing too. We also all did a Hammam at their spa and it was one of the most wonderful experiences and not to be missed! The roof terrace is a beautiful place to relax. And while we visited in December (so we didn't swim) they do have two pools for those who wish to cool off when it gets hotter. The staff was friendly and you really felt like they cared about your stay. The location is perfect--only about a 10ish minute walk to the main square and the souks. We hope to return to Marrakech some day in the next few years and will definitely stay at Riad Melhoun when we do!,Date of stay: December 2022,,"Boston, United States",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N8572JTlaurenh

We arrived late at Riad Melhoun and had asked in advance if they could make us dinner. On our arrival we were treated to the best meal we had during our entire stay in Morocco. We had dinner at a different very well reviewed riad the following night and what we were served was nowhere close to as good as what we had at Riad Melhoun. If you are staying here you should definitely have dinner!    Breakfast is also extraordinary. It is a parade of carefully selected local products and treats. If you have a sweet tooth you will love your morning meal.    Every staff member at Riad Melhoun really cares about every detail of the experience they provide.

Riad Melhoun & Spa,Zayna L wrote a review Oct 2022,50,Top Class Riad,I cannot recommend this riad enough. We experienced hospitality beyond what we’ve ever known in a beautiful backdrop to our first stay together in Marrakech. I would recommend enjoying breakfast by the pool downstairs as you’ll often have it all to yourself and don’t pass up the opportunity to eat dinner here AT LEAST once; our favourite meals were served here despite having eaten in some VERY fine establishments elsewhere in Marrakech. It’s atmospheric to chill by the rooftop pool in the evenings and we spent many hours reading in the alcove seating areas which were very comfortable. We loved being able to call this place home after busy days out in the slightly stressful souks which are suitably (but not inconveniently) far away! We’re already looking at booking here again same time next year.

Walking down the road the small entrance door opens up into a cosy reception and wonderful relaxing space to take tea. The decoration is traditional and the staff are some of the most welcoming often just stopping to say hi and see if there is anything further they can do.    The spa is small so book in advance but the couples treatment was 3 hours well spent. Breakfast is traditional and filling and the rooftop terrace a pleasure to escape some of the busyness of Marrakesh.

There are only 9 rooms so it is quiet. It is right in the heart of the city which means you can walk to almost any of the cites (I booked a walking tour through the hotel and that guide was wonderful). The hammam and massage were wonderful and the breakfast which is included is delicious. Most importantly Tarik and the entire staff were amazing!

Riad Melhoun & Spa,westernsheikh wrote a review May 2022,50,Great 5 night stay @ Riad Melhoun & SPA,Stayed for 5 nights as a Couple and child at the top floor suite tent room in February 2022 straight after the Covid 19 travel ban was lifted.    The Riad is beautiful clean and decorated in the traditional Morrocan style. The entire staff team is super friendly accommodating and provide exceptional service. They truly do put a lot of genuine effort and passion into serving the needs of their customers. The location is also very good right in the middle of old city with walking distances to various soukhs shopping streets restaurants Jama El fanaa square and the Bahia Palace.    The top floor tent room is probably the biggest room in Riad accommodating a king size double bed and a single bed for kids. The room was clean and spacious with a fridge and decent size wardrobe. The tent had a separate area partitioned off by a curtain to accommodate a bath tub and a toilet. The roof top terrace is right out side the room with sun loungers and a good size jacuzzi pool surrounded by various cactus plants. The area is well maintained and creates a relaxing environment right outside the tent suite.    The breakfast is very good and is served on demand in whatever common area of the hotel you choose. The breakfast service is excellent and staff lay on different types of breakfast every day ranging from eggs various kinds of pancakes fruits yogurts cakes jams coffees and teas and off course the fresh Morrocan Orange juice. You can ask for whatever you need and the staff even prepared a special Morrocan egg tagine for breakfast one day when we wanted to try something different. So the breakfast is adequate good quality and has some thing for every one.    We had dinner at the Riad for our 10th anniversary and were pleasantly surprised. The staff made a lot of effort to prepare for the event and we were consulted on the menu choices and out likes and preferences. We pretty much designed our own menu with starters salads tagine of our choice deserts and the staff executed it really well.    Overall we were really pleased with our stay at the Riad Melhoun and Spa. The staff went above and beyond to look after us.

Everything is easily walkable from the riad we only got a taxi a couple of times during our stay as we preferred to walk around and explore instead.    We looked forward to the breakfasts every day there were crepes yoghurt fruit coffee fresh orange juice and our favourite was something called M'smen (I think!) which for Scottish people like us is similar to a tattie scone!

Riad Melhoun & Spa,Georgia B wrote a review Feb 2022,50,The most magical stay at Riad Melhoun.,As a frequent traveler i have been the patron of a number of Hotels Hostels and Inns but never in my travels have i been so well attended to than by the staff at The Riad Melhoun & Spa.    During our breif stay we have been met with a level of care and attentiveness the likes of which I am almost certain I will never sample again anywhere else save for a return visit.  The décor is astounding the locale vibrant and the ambiance - ideal for a genuine taste of the very best Marrakech has to offer.    We arrived early in the afternoon to be greeted by a perfect welcome from our host Nour. My wife and i after being shown to our room were then treated a Spa treatment and to what was among the best meals we had in the city.  The star of which a Wedding Tagine they had been lovingly preparing for a full 24 hours in advance of our arrival.    The Spa treatment we undertook was for lack of a better word perfect.    There is nothing about this stay that i would have changed. Coming back every evening was akin to coming home and even though as i write this i am on the plane - returning to my actual home it is the Riad Melhoun Spa that i wish i was returning.,Date of stay: February 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"San Francisco, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgiab137

From all the staff that went above and beyond to the beautifully decorated rooms the beautiful garden pool area amazing spa/massage and the centrally located location there was nothing else we could want. Our only regret is we wish we had booked more days there. While all the staff was great we really appreciated the general manager giving us a thorough deep dive on how to walk to all the sights from the Riad the desk managers for always checking in with us the ladies at the spa for doing an amazing job and the chef for the delicious breakfasts and dinners we had there and everyone else who keeps this gem running,Date of stay: October 2021,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Chicago, Illinois",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CatHod1

Riad Melhoun & Spa,alfredo f wrote a review May 2020,50,Beyond expectations,Our stay was beyond my expectations and really defined hospitality in a new way. My wife 3 year old son and I stayed at Riad Melhoun for two nights the first week of October 2019. From the start we were met with a level of attention that made us feel immediately welcome. Not that any other place wouldn’t try and make you feel at home but there was something really nice here. The only way I can express it is that it was an experience based on emotional transactions. It was very clear that all the staff especially the manager Mohamed felt it was priority that the guests all feel welcome and comfortable. What made it special and refreshing was that you were given a sense that it made the staff genuinely happy to see you happy. This feeling of hospitality extended past the walls of the riad. It was important that you enjoy Marrakech as a whole in the way that was best for you. I think of this trip often. My son won’t let me forget how much he enjoyed it and his new friend Mohamed. My wife is as nostalgic as I am despite the fact it’s only been seven months since the trip. I’ve never reviewed anything but I felt it was important for the emotions I will always have.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/799alfredof

The staff here were all so friendly and couldn't say more positive things about the manager Mohammed - he really made our stay in Marrakech extra special.    After a long day travelling to the hotel (because our flight was delayed) we were presented with delicious tea before being shown around the beautiful riad with stunning views of the Medina area to then be showed to our rooms to relax. Before heading out Mohammed then spent a bit of time going through the map of the Medina pointing out good spots to eat things to do and see and giving a guide on prices that we should be paying.    Will admit we did have some issues with noise on the first night but this was resolved and Mohammed went over the top to ensure we were happy. All the staff within the riad were friendly and welcoming. The breakfast was delicious (still trying to get used to not having this everyday) and the dinner we had also was amazing!    If you're looking for a stay in the Medina area I would certainly recommend this place. Ideally located to see some of the historical sites and a very short walk to the souks and markets.

The staff were extremely hospitable and and helpful. They recommended us some of the best things to do and even sat down with us and constructed a personalized full days itinerary of what to do in Marrakesh during our timeline. Very above and beyond.    The breakfast at this place was outstanding! So much delicious food and along with great tea and coffee. They were very accommodating to our time frame and even served us breakfast early the one morning. Having it included in the price of the booking was amazing. We unfortunately didn't get the chance to dine in for dinner but it seemed amazing.    The room itself was perfect not to mention gorgeously decorated. It had all the amenities you would need and was cleaned daily.    The location of this riad was perfect! Has lots of great food options in the immediate area was only a 10 minutes walk to the main square and was within walking distance to other major attractions such as the palace and the tombs. However let it be warned: when you first arrive and are looking to get to the riad do NOT listen to the men trying to direct you to its location unless you are willing to pay them a fee. When we first arrived with our big suitcase we were immediately targeted. The riad is located on some side streets and having unfamiliar men directing you to come down these less busy side streets was off putting at first not to mention that they were pretty incessant. But fear not all the streets are lined with cameras and you will be totally safe. Just ignore them by not talking to them and walk to the place yourself.

Riad Melhoun & Spa,Sven Knepper wrote a review Feb 2020,50,A real treat!,The Riad is located in a quiet side street in the medina of Marrakech a stone's throw from some of the most popular tourist spots including the Bahia and Badi palaces and the Jama'a el Fna. While the exterior might be underwhelming (something that you'll see everywhere in Marrakech) we entered a whole new world as soon as the door opened.    We arrived late and the reception was warm and welcoming and we were made to feel at home from the start. The staff was very helpful competent and always friendly. They were always accommodating with special requests and forthcoming with advice for first-time tourists to the city.    The interior is straight out of 1001 Nights clean and well-kept. The room wass small but clean with a genuine touch of Moroccan flair.    The food was truly amazing. Typical Moroccan cuisine plentiful and tasty. The chicken-lemon tajine and the couscous were particularly tasty and will be missed.    The hamam experience on the last day was a perfect way to end our stay.

Riad Melhoun & Spa,Shannon wrote a review Feb 2020,50,Exceeded all expectations! Prepare to be pampered!,We spent three nights at Riad Melhoun in February and our stay exceeded all expectations. The Riad offered a relaxing retreat from the busy streets and souks of Marrakech. This city can be intense! You will most likely be dodging mopeds on narrow streets haggling with shop keepers and trying to avoid unsolicited advice. It was so nice to come ‘home’ to the peaceful riad with its beautiful central atrium rooftop terrace and relaxing common spaces.    Although the Riad was an oasis in the middle of chaos the best part of our stay was the amazing staff. We were blown away by their hospitality and how hard they worked to keep all of their guests happy. Ahmed and Tarik served breakfast on the terrace each morning that included fresh squeezed orange juice coffee crepes Moroccan pancakes and other treats. They also served us a couple amazing poolside dinners on the nights that we chose to stay in and enjoy our personal retreat. Nour spent time with us answering questions and providing recommendations and bartering tips. They were professional yet friendly and we were greeted with smiles and offers of mint tea every time we returned. Their hospitality made our visit to Marrakech truly special!    Anyone considering a stay in a riad should understand that this is not a typical hotel and historic buildings may not have modern amenities (like elevator mini-fridge TV etc). The rooms are a bit small but the shared common areas offer a ton of extra space. This is part of the experience and I wouldn’t want them to change anything!! I highly recommend Riad Melhoun to anyone who is looking for an authentic riad experience and a place to relax in Marrakech.,Date of stay: February 2020,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThornsNRoses

Riad Melhoun has the NICEST WARMEST FRIENDLIEST MOST WELCOMING AND ACCOMMODATING staff ever. They literally bent over backwards to make sure we enjoyed our stay and their kindness was greatly appreciated (big thank you to Mohammad and Ahmed). This Riad truly is beautiful. It is tucked away in the small winding streets of the Red City just walking distance from the famous souk as well as the lively busy Medina full of restaurants and markets. Every morning we had a lovely Moroccan breakfast with the table set in a traditional moroccan manner. Having the guys pour us Moroccan tea and join in on the laugher and fun made it that much more fun. All meals are in the central courtyard which is surrounded by beautiful Moroccan decor. There is no roof so the chirping of sweet birds adds to the overall ambiance. There is also a roof terrace which you can have breakfast on if you prefer. The rooms are cozy and clean with daily tidying service. At first we had a beautiful room on the bottom floor with a large shower but wanting more privacy we were moved to the rooftop. There are lots of stairs and we had large heavy luggage but it was if magic happened because the staff packed and moved our things without us having to do a thing. We are forever grateful for the hospitality we received here.

It is a small atmospheric and extremely comfortable riad which is hidden away in the streets of the Old Town. The staff are very helpful and friendly the food is superb and we thoroughly enjoyed feeling like part of the family. It really set the scene for a fantastic holiday in Marrakech and was an oasis to relax in after the noise and bustle of the streets and markets.

Riad Melhoun & Spa,Gabrielle R wrote a review Jan 2020,50,Gorgeous oasis of calm,From the moment we were met at the door of Riad Melhoun we felt genuinely welcomed - such a lovely retreat from the madness of the Medina! The riad is beautiful - lovely intricate carvings with quiet nooks and crannies everywhere plus a magic roof-top retreat. Our room - Maya - was on the 2nd floor - spacious really comfortable bed & pillows - and we couldn’t believe how quiet (& dark!) the room was - couldn’t even hear the calls to prayer. We had 2 dinners here - great meals - each dish explained & fantastic service. When I mentioned that I loved the olives in one of the salads they bought another bowl of them! Direction wise we found it easy to find our way home after each day of wandering as it’s quite a direct walking route from the Jamaa fna square - after you’ve done it once! Also thoroughly recommend the spa & hammam- more like a western spa experience than a traditional hammam but with a little more nudity :)!

Riad Melhoun & Spa,809anujav wrote a review Jan 2020,40,Great location & hospitality,We are a family of 4 adults stayed for 3 nights at the Riad Melhoun in December 2019.    Positives:  1. Superb location if you want to stay within the walled city it is close by to the main square with all the souvenir shops and souks a short 5min walk away.    2. Service is excellent and the staff is super helpful and will take extra efforts to fulfill every need. Special mention to Mohammad and Ahmed for all their help during our stay. We really appreciated when they arranged for some special items for breakfast at our request.    3. The dinner at the Riad is a must have experience with beautiful table decor soothing Morrocan music in the background and traditional cuisine. The food was freshly prepared and extremely flavorful and our two dinners there was one of the highlights of our stay in Marrakesh.    4. The rooms are very clean and housekeeping standards are high. Bed and bath linen was spotless.    5. The terrace is very beautiful and has a lovely sitting to enjoy the sun/evenings.    Things to keep in mind:    1. We were quite surprised by the size and layout of the rooms as we were expecting them to be larger. We had one suite and one deluxe room which were located at the terrace. As a family of 4 adults on a 2week trip across the region we had big suitcases and there was no space to open them especially in the deluxe room. We ended up keeping all our bags in the suite itself.    2. The deluxe room: The size of the room is extremely small. The bed can be a little cramped for two adults and is more suited for a solo traveler. The transparent glass door to the bathroom makes it a little tougher if you are staying with someone.    3. The suite: While the size is larger than the deluxe room the lighting is extremely dim so that even in the day we had to keep the door open to let some sunlight in. Also the bathroom of the suite is not very convenient to use. There is a bathtub only and no separate shower area and one needs to be extremely careful while getting in and out of the tub. Additionally since there is no partition or curtain to the tub the water sloshes out and result in a slippery floor. There are no hooks/towel racks etc in the bathroom for hanging towels/clothes etc.    4. A shout out to travellers who might not be comfortable with stairs most of the rooms are in the upper floors which would involve climbing stairs which are slightly thick and uneven.    Overall would recommend for it's great location and superb service & food. However would be good to keep in mind the layout of the rooms and size especially if travelling in a group/with family.,Date of stay: December 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"New Delhi, India",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/809anujav

The moment we arrived we were greeted by Ahmed who carried our luggage and walked us directly to Riad Melhoun. Everything was perfect we were offered a tour of the courtyard rooftop terrace and the hammam and spa. They offered us dinner for 20 euro per person at our convenience so we took advantage at 9:30pm! Ahmed even went the extra mile and found Casablanca beer for us! Our room was clean the water was hot (which was perfect since we had just come from 3 days in the desert) and we were able to sleep immediately since the surroundings of the Riad was so quiet! The WiFi was also the best out of all our stays in Morocco. The breakfast and dinner was amazing!!

Riad Melhoun & Spa,Ankit A wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Amazing Stay,I traveled with to Marrakech with 3 friends in December 2019. We had an amazing stay at Riad Melhoun. The location is great - right next to some of the palaces and about a 10 minute walk to the center square of the medina (Jemaa el-Fnaa).    What really stood out was the staff and how awesome they were! Tariq was helpful throughout the stay and took us out to the cab area called the cab when it didn't show up on time and was just a friendly presence (at 4 AM when were heading to the airport!). The other folks (ah! Can't remember the names) - were also very helpful recommending restaurants telling us where to go making reservations etc! They were very proactive and I felt it significantly enhanced the experience in the city.    The property itself is beautiful! It was nice to stay in a traditional Riad. The one downside is that the rooms (although beautifully decorated and comfortable) are relatively small compared to what you would expect at a typical 4-5 star hotel (think a room in a nice Hyatt/Marriott).    We did do the dinner 1 night at 20 euros/person and I highly recommend that. The apple pie type dessert was delicious!    We did the hammam elsewhere (at Heritage Spa) just to try something else outside of the Riad. While it was great there in retrospect we probably would have done the in house hammam (comparable price and I'm sure it would have been a comparable experience but much more convenient to be able to go your room right after).    Overall 5/5 - was our best accommodation in Morocco and would recommend highly to anyone coming for a visit!,Date of stay: December 2019,,"Chapel Hill, North Carolina",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/580ankita

The rooms were amazingly furnished and styled but most importantly they were also a comfortable size compared to other riads in Marrakech. The location is also very central. It is near attractions like the Bahia Palace Dar Si Said Museum and around 12 minutes walk to the Jemaa el-fna square. But what really blew us away was the genuine hospitality of the staff. Everybody from the reception to the serving staff were helpful and friendly. Simple things like requesting for extra eggs for breakfast was attended to very quickly. Unfortunately we stayed at Riad Melhoun for just a night since we were there during the last leg of our trip. I attempted to add a day to our stay but the riad was really fully booked.

Riad Melhoun & Spa,Anthony Vazquez wrote a review Oct 2019,50,A Gorgeous Oasis. Amazing Staff.,My partner and I decided to stay at the Riad Melhoun for the later half our trip - after visiting the Sahara near Merzouga. This location was everything we needed for a relaxing two day stay after traveling. As soon as you walk in the door the calming scent of the main space lets you know that you've left the busy city streets behind you. All the furnishings and decorations were beautiful and you can tell the space was designed with details in mind. This was far above any other locations I stayed for my trip and was still an easy quick walk to main city locations.    Most notable of all- the staff are amazing here! We mostly interacted with Ahmed and Mohamed but everyone we came in contact with was extremely accommodating and ready to go the extra mile; from talking to a taxi driver bringing us over from the bus station to providing a scale for us to weight bags for our flight. They really make this place unlike any other place I've stayed.    Also! we had a delightful hammam and massage activity as part of our stay. I would recommend this too. Breakfast and dinner were delicious. They even readily accommodated a last minute change to our plans to have dinner at the hotel.

Riad Melhoun & Spa,Rollsy87 wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Wonderful Riad Stay,I am not one for writing reviews but I felt I needed to share my experience of Marrakech and our wonderful stay we had at Riad Melhoun. I was a bit nervous after reading reviews about the busy streets but our hosts greeted us and made us feel at home and very relaxed from the off. They were so friendly and attentive and went above and beyond for us. One of the lovely guys from reception even went out to a souk to get me a particular item I was after for a fantastic price.    The hotel is very small and exclusive which we liked. It's in a fantastic location only 5/10 minutes depending on how distracted you get by the souks to the main square. The streets can be a maze but this location was easy to find for us and felt very safe and quiet from the busy streets.    The hotel staff Nour Ahamed and Mohamed to name a few were always around to help us and gave us some great tips and advice to prepare us for the shopping experience.  Breakfast was a highlight for me and the food just kept coming. We had everything we needed from tea coffee pancakes crepes omlettes and muffins with all the jams and honey. Mint tea was on tap and also brought to us when requested throughout the day/evening and it was included with our stay.  Enjoying it on the beautiful roof terrace was a highlight.    We ate one meal in the Riad and if I known I would have definitely eaten more. It was very reasonable priced and was cooked to perfection the traditional Morrocan way.    The building itself has some great history and is beautifully furnished. It makes for some gorgeous pictures.    The staff are also fantastic camera men and spend the time if you ask to get the perfect shot. Literally nothing is too much trouble and everything is done with a smile.    I would without a doubt recommend this Riad to friends and family and would love to come back hoping to see the fantastic staff that served us so well and made us feel like friends.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rollsy87
Riad Melhoun & Spa,Yasmin S wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Best part of our trip.,My partner and I along with our friends had a lovely stay at the riad. It’s beautiful and really central however we heard nothing of the hussle and bustle once inside. I couldn’t have asked for more. The guys (Ahmed Mohamed Nouri and all the other staff) were so polite friendly welcoming and greeted us by name every time we entered the building. They gave great advise how to navigate the souks and arranged many tuk-tuks (best price for four to travel a distance) we had breakfast around the court yard/ pool every morning and days we had dinner was candlelit around the pool with rose petals. Mint tea was on tap and poured for us whenever we requested and teas were brought to our sick friend without us even asking. The room was beautiful (suite) with robes towels all showergels shampoo etc.. rose water by the sink was a really nice touch.  Really such a welcoming place without being intrusive. My pictures don’t do it justice however the place would be great for families couples people looking to relax and a dream for an ‘instagrammer’ for the many photo opportunities. We made a great choice staying here.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Gibraltar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YasminS50

Riad Melhoun & Spa,Christopher B wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Beautiful Riad with exceptional service in Marrakech,Three full days at Riad Melhoun constituted one of the the most memorable hotel experiences in 30 years of international travel.    The riad is beautiful inside with breakfast tables plus cozy alcoves surrounding a small pool on the ground floor where you can sit relax take tea and snack any time of day. One morning they served breakfast on the still-cool terrace. As with other riads in the Medina our room was compact but it was very clean comfortable and well air-conditioned.    Riad Manager Issam was very responsive friendly well educated and so knowledgeable in Moroccan culture.    Service at Riad Melhoun was exceptional. Recommendations on restaurants museums palaces and gardens were spot-on. Hotel advice on efficient walking routes to the sights was accurate and most welcome since Marrakech was unseasonably hot during mid-Sept 2019.

Be careful he has many jokes and is super laid back. We talked about many topics and you can tell he knows alot about many things pertaining to Morocco.    He's a genuine and trustworthy even went as far as surprising me with a cake for my bday in the desert.

The staff make you feel like honoured guests and try to fulfill every wish. They took a lot of time answering questions and giving us tips. They are proud of their Riad and rightfully so and it shows in their work. The Riad is among the most beautiful we saw in our ten day stay in Marrakech. Everything was very clean. The only tiny nuisance we had was that our room was towards the street and at night it could be a bit loud till around 12pm. This is very nit picky and shows how great a time we had.

Starting from the very clean and beautiful house until the outstanding staff which was so friendly helpful and hospitable.    As the Riad is located near Bahia Palace the Medina and a lot of things we wanted to see are within walking distance. So we walked lot and took taxis only in case of bigger distances.    We travel a lot and love to stay in rather small accommodations as the Riad is. But we never experienced a hospitality like this. We felt very welcomed and are still impressed of the whole package including the rooms the dinner the hamam but especially from the extraordinary team: Thank you very much for making the stay so nice!

It had been beautifully made up with lots of candles and rose petals. The doors opened out onto the pool area. Our dinner and breakfast was taken directly outside of our room door.  A fridge filled with soft drinks an iron and ironing board and a proper hairdryer were an unexpected bonus.  The breakfast is from 8am until 11pm and is traditional with the offer of eggs. We had dinner there the first night and after that we ate at the food market.    The Riad is a ten minute walk to the main square. The walk is past lots of shops cafes and street sellers.

Riad Melhoun & Spa,PureWanderer wrote a review Jul 2019,50,Beautiful place with incredible service and food (& wine!),We had a fabulous stay with Riad Melhoun. They were so amazingly accommodating. They even kept our luggage for us while we were on our 3 day Sahara desert tour so we didn’t have to lug it all with us like the other people on the tour. The Riad is small but beautiful. Tall people might have to do some bending down a lot here lol. We had lovely dinners and breakfast here on the rooftop terrace and in the courtyard by the pool. Definitely a very romantic spot. It is located down a couple of small alleys so make sure to get directions from the staff who will help you with a map to shopping and other sightseeing. We still got a little lost once after shopping but our gps got us back eventually. The staff were so kind and informative. Their advice for shopping and dealing with the locals was invaluable for two blond young women traveling together in Morocco. We did as they suggested and felt safe and confident. They even told us how much things should cost so we knew how to barter at the souks. Our food was fantastic! We both bought tagines so we can try making some at home. And they have wine!!! You can’t bring your own in but you can have walk a Moroccan wine with dinner which was so nice after a long busy three day desert tour. We just wish we had more time there for spa treatments and sun tanning on the terrace.

It is so so so beautiful perfectly located: a little off one of the main streets in the medina both close to the square and Saadian tombs and palace Bahia and nestled in a quiet alleyway which was perfect for when we needed to escape the hustle and bustle of the medina. The rooftop terrace was a dream breakfast and dinner were good and we did the hammam and massage package which was fantastic!

Riad Melhoun & Spa,Louloutravels wrote a review Jul 2019,50,WOW,Riad Melhoun is simply a little slice of paradise!    I cannot put into words how stunning this Riad is and the most special part about it is the staff. Every single one of Riad Melhouns staff were just so kind helpful thoughtful and genuine!    We were a group of 7 girls and we all thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.    The rooftop is stunning (picture is view from up there) the pool/snug area - tranquil (pool is much smaller than pictures shown but still perfect for cooling down in the Morrocan heat) the rooms were home from home (even down to cotton pads/buds).    Everything about this place is great. Perfect for couples families girly get away.    Breakfast is tasty although not for a typical British person. Lots of sweet fresh pastries pancakes fruit salad and fresh orange juice etc.    The area is super safe and very well lit at night for anyone who has their reservations about the location.    Thank you so much and we will be returning (hopefully this summer!),Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Louloutravels93
Riad Melhoun & Spa,wayneajt wrote a review Jun 2019,50,A Relaxing Haven In A Busy City,The streets of Marrakech are very busy and we arrived at the Riad and as soon as you are behind the doors it is so peaceful and relaxing. The Riad is really beautifully designed and very clean. There is a lovely terrace for eating lunch/dinner/chilling out on.    The staff really make this please great. They are so friendly and do everything they can to make your stay better. They welcome you with free tea and gave us a great restaurant recommendation one night and they even booked the restaurant for us.    On the first day we had dinner in the Riad which was great traditional Moroccan food and the staff explained the different local traditions. The breakfast is excellent with a wide variety of food and you can ask for anything extra you want (we asked for eggs).    The Riad also sells lunch which we had on the terrace. There is beer and wine available which is a nice extra as many of the Riads do not offer this option.    We also made use of the hammam and massage facility which was lovely and relaxing.    We would highly recommend. Thanks for a great stay Fiona & Wayne,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Scotland, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wayneajt

Riad Melhoun & Spa,TravellerG92 wrote a review Jun 2019,50,Absolutely Amazing,We have just returned from a 6 night break in Marrakech 2 nights of which we stayed in Riad Melhoun and I only wish it could have been longer.    From the moment we arrived the staff were so wonderfully helpful offering us traditional tea a tour of the Riad and an explanation of the map and how best to find any spots we may be interested in whilst we waited for the room. Despite arriving 3 hrs before check in time the cleaners made sure our room was ready as soon as possible which we really appreciated.    We stayed in the junior suite which was gorgeous clean and comfortable and the double doors opened out onto the ground floor pool area. I’ve seen a few reviews mention the pool is cold and not for swimming they’re traditional plunge pools so that’s to be expected.    Location was brilliant a 10 minute (literally) stroll to Jemaa Al Fna and the souks and a short taxi ride to places such as YSL museum and Jardin Majorelle. The staff ensured we had a taxi booked and the taxi driver was so sweet never overcharging as price had been pre agreed. The airport transfer is also great they were waiting outside for us with a sign and again no overcharging.    We had breakfast which was traditional Moroccan food with the option to order an omelette if this didn’t suffice although in the heat the breakfast was plenty.    The rooftop is a lovely oasis to return to for an afternoon of relaxing after spending the morning exploring the souks they even managed to find us some Moroccan wine!    Overall it was an amazing stay and we will absolutely return next time we visit Marrakech. The staff couldn’t have done more for us and made everything so easy. Thankyou team.

Fantastic and helpful staff perfect location tasty food etc. Lovely rooms and terrace too. The staff made us feel very welcome and saved us plenty of headaches by helping out with airport shuttles and booking of day trips. I can't see why anyone would grumble about location - it's 5 minutes walk from Badi and Bahia Palaces and 10 mins walk to Jma El Fna Sq - but it's also far enough to be quiet and peaceful when you get in from a days walking around the markets. The guys in the Riad also make the best 'Berber Whisky' around! Would reccommend to anyone.

The common area where breakfast is served with the pool is instagram-worthy and you can soak in and relax by the pool.    The bedroom is small but the toilet is one of the cleanest we have stayed in Morocoo!    We took the hammam massage package at 55 euros per pax and the dinner at 20 euros per pax. It may seem expensive than what you can find in medina but because it is the first day after the one month of fasting festival a lot of restaurants are not open (even those open do not have a lot of food options) and we decide to be safe and opt for dinner in. The hammam and massage area is very clean too!    We are really thankful for the staff Tarik Hammom Mohammad and one more guy we are sorry we didnt catch his name. They make you feel like at home here is the riad and also Tarik helped us to buy train tickets in advance (as it is their celebration we read online it is hard to get train tickets) without additional charge.

Nothing was too much trouble and they went above and beyond. My mother broke her toe while we were there and the staff made sure they had food for her or helped her get around if we needed to go out. We were really treated like royalty.  if you are a light sleeper you will hear sounds from the street in the medina or from the riad itself late at night or early morning.

I loved experiencing all the hustle & bustle of Marrakesh and it was wonderful to retreat to the peace and order created by the team at Riad Melhoun.    The staff deserve special mention for working together to seamlessly provide a first class experience for their guests: the management and reception staff offer impeccable service and hospitality standards (honestly second to none); the cook & serving staff provide breakfast lunch and dinner that were always fresh and delicious; and the cleaner kept the whole place immaculate. We’d also recommend taking up the Hammam & massage.    The Riad is of architectural interest and beautifully restored. We enjoyed both the roof terrace and the central courtyard space for meals and even spent a couple of afternoons just relaxing on the sun beds on the roof terrace. The location couldn’t be more perfect a quiet spot within the medina so we felt relaxed but all the city sites were walkable.    Outside of our Riad the restaurants we enjoyed the most were The Nomad for its chicken tagine the YSL museum for its salads and La Fassia for its ambience. We visited the Marjorelle gardens YSL museum secret garden palaces tombs souk and photographic gallery in Marrakesh - so lots to do as well as day trips to Essouria & to the Atlas Mountains during our week long stay.    As our stay was over Christmas (22nd-29th December 2018) I thought the Christmas tree & tasteful decorations a particularly nice touch.    Thank you all so much for your generous hospitality.

Riad Melhoun & Spa,Andy Miles wrote a review Dec 2018,50,Christmas Holiday,My wife and I stayed at Riad Melhoun and Spa in Marrakesh over Christmas 2018. This was our first time in Morocco. Research in 'prior reviews' is important to us and I sincerely hope my followimg comments will help future travellers when choosing where to stay. Firstly I should add that this Riad is centrally located to the south of the Medina close to the Bahia and El Badii Palaces Saadian tombs and only a short walk to Jemaa el-fna square which is a hive of activity particularly evening time. On arrival we were initially greeted by Mohamed who was extremely friendly and welcoming. Mohamed gave us the lowdown on local customs and generally what to expect during our stay. I would highly recommend booking a Hammam and massage at Melhoun a perfect way to start or end your stay in Morocco. There are many cultural activities to enjoy all within walking distance of the Riad. For stays of 4 days or more day trips to the Atlas Mountains or Essaouira are well worth the experience. Breakfast is freshly prepared daily and having sampled the cuisine in various other establishments you would be hard pushed to find better elsewhere (Including lunches and evening meals). Food can be enjoyed on the ground floor courtyard & pool area or on the beautiful private roof top terrace both of which are tastefully furnished and landscaped. Lastly a well deserved mention to the 'Melhoun Team' who made our stay a memorable one. We had dealings mainly with Mohamed Nour Issam Rachid and Ahmed but house keeping kitchen cleaning and admin reception was all delivered to an exemplary standard. It takes effort and dedication to ensure such a high level of service and this team should make the owners and in fact the whole of Morocco proud. Thanks again we'll be back.

Riad Melhoun & Spa,Sabrian42 wrote a review Dec 2018,50,A Perfect Stay,The biggest mistake of my stay in Marrakech might have been that we only spent one night here. Everything about this Riad was absolutely perfect. They were in contact with us before our stay Mohammad met our driver and personally escorted us to the Riad where we were greeted with Mint Tea and a small tour the room was comfortable the place was decorated for Christmas which was a wonderful touch... I could go on and on.  The main highlights of our extremely short stay:  The location. The other Riad we stayed in was hard to find and had us going through some confusing streets and passing kids who constantly pestered us by saying we were going the wrong way Riad Melhoun was only a stone’s throw away from the Bahia palace and extremely easy to find.  The food. The dinner we had here was easily the best meal we had in Morocco. Not only was it a beautiful atmosphere but the service was impeccable and I’m still dreaming about the tagine a week later.  The Hammam. Earlier in my vacation I heard horror stories from other tourists about their hammam experience and I almost canceled ours but I’m so glad I didn’t. The small private spa was steps away from our room and an absolutely amazing experience. It was so relaxing and it was set up so after our hammam and massage we only had to change in our room and then walk down the stairs to get dinner. Everything was perfect.  If I could give six stars I truly would because our stay at Riad Melhoun was absolutely magical. If I’m ever lucky enough to return to Marrakech I would go back there in a heartbeat.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sabrian42

Riad Melhoun & Spa,GFerny wrote a review Nov 2018,50,"Kind staff, great location, gorgeous riad!",On our first visit to Marrakech we struck gold by choosing Riad Melhoun. Every element of our stay was perfect and we can't recommend it enough!    Riad Melhoun is just a five minute walk from Djemaa el-Fna Marrakech's main square and about two minutes from El Bahia Palace. It's also tucked away a few turns off a main street which makes it quiet peaceful and very relaxing after the hustle and bustle of the city.    While it was Riad Melhoun's beautiful decor that initially caught our attention it was really the riad staff's kindness and attentiveness that made our visit so lovely. Everyone was extremely helpful and a pleasure to chat with. They always anticipated our every need and took of arranging our airport transfer a 3-day desert tour early breakfast luggage storage a hammam appointment . . .everything we hoped for and more! They're superstars!    Our room at Riad Melhoun was spacious tastefully decorated and very comfortable. The room was quiet and cool at night the bathroom had a beautiful tile sink and walk-in stone shower and both were well-stocked with anything you could need. Our room was also conveniently located near the hammam and we HIGHLY recommend taking advantage of the spa offerings here! The riad's hammam was one of the best parts of our trip.    Riad Melhoun also has a great collection of public spaces that are all lovely to spend time in. The rooftop terrace has numerous places to sit and nice views of the surrounding neighborhood. The courtyard is stocked with cute tables and chairs as well as a library nook with a fireplace and a small red seating area with plush cushions and video footage of Moroccan excursions. After a long day of walking and sightseeing it was nice to be able to sit in a comfy chair next to a crackling fire.    Our stay at Riad Melhoun was perfect. The riad had everything we needed and more and it's a fantastic place to stay in Marrakech.

The rooms are wonderful the staff is amazing (they know you by name & will help you plan out your time in Marrakech) and the whole atmosphere is very tranquil & peaceful. It's nice after a long day of exploring to come back to such an incredible place! The breakfast is great.

To begin with the people that work here are incredible. The most hospitable people I’ve ever met (and I travel frequently). Muhamed Noor Ahmed Rashid and all the rest of the team will make you feel like you are at home with family. They are such caring individuals and a true pleasure to be around.    The staff treated us with such attention and care. My girlfriend and I got engaged here and I truly couldn’t have picked a better place to share such a beautiful moment.    The whole team went out of their way to help me plan the moment and my girlfriend was happy beyond words. I will never forget it and am so happy we got to share it with the staff at Riad Melhoun.    Aside from having the happiest moment of our lives in this beautiful Riad we loved the place itself. It felt like home. The delicious dinners they prepared the care with which they set the tables and the cleanliness of the riad was just wonderful. We felt welcomed taken care of and so happy to have found such a magical place.    The staff were incredibly helpful in planning our outings around the city. We wanted a tuk tuk they got it we needed a ride somewhere they got it I wanted flowers for my fiancee they found them. Honestly 5 stars is not enough for this riad.    We feel so blessed to have found this place and to have shared moments with the staff. We can’t wait to return!!!!!!!!

Riad Melhoun & Spa,Sgrddv12 wrote a review Oct 2018,40,"Good, but not great",A very beautiful Riad that is close to the main squares and medinas that you will want to explore. The facility includes nice common areas such as a pool library couches and a great rooftop. The staff is extremely nice and attentive. My only issues were with accessing the riad. You have to go past some construction (which I'm sure is temporary) but worse was the long waits every time we wanted to enter the front door to the riad. The front desk was not always attended and the staff were not quick to open the door when you knock or ring the door bell.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sgrddv12

I don't know what to start with but I have so many nice points to mention:  1. Check-in was absolutely amazing a nice tea and some pastries to try a lounge to relax before going to the room no rush the host really offered us that state of holiday mood!  2. We received a whole tour of the Riad a bit of history an explanation of where everything is etc.  3. The riad made an exception and prepared us breakfast at 6:30 in the morning ! That was so nice of them especially because we were the only ones. A nicely prepared table with some tasty items for breakfast.  4. Good Wi-Fi available but honestly you won't need much of that considering how beautiful the Riad is.  5. Excellent prices affordable and really worth every penny / dirham.

Riad Melhoun & Spa,acasey wrote a review Sep 2018,50,Best riad in Marrakech!,After a lot of research on hotels and riads in Marrakech my husband and I booked Riad Melhoun for a 6-night stay in August. The riad is quite unimposing from the outside but the interior really blew us away. The intricate detail of the decor made sure we did not forget that we were staying in Morocco. Every evening when we would come back after a long day of walking we felt a real sense of calm and luxury that is not always easy to find in Marrakech!    The food was also really spectacular (especially dinner). The first night we arrived our dinner was prepared for us and although we tried a couple of other restaurants during our stay I think we ended up eating at the riad 4 out of the 6 nights. The menu changes daily and the chef prepares the food based on market availability/freshness so we ended up trying foods that we may not have necessarily ordered ourselves but in fact really enjoyed. My mouth is actually watering just thinking back on all the delicious meals!    Every member of the staff we interacted with couldn't do enough for us and were so accommodating. I have traveled all over the world for work and pleasure and I have to say the customer service at Riad Melhoun was second to none.

Marrakech is an amazing place but it can get a bit overwhelming so it was important to have a place that was so peaceful and welcoming to return to each day. When you're inside this riad you feel total relaxation as if you're no where near all the hustle and bustle of the medina which is just steps away from this beautiful place. My suite was large quiet and very comfortable. With all that said what makes this place special is the staff. Everybody involved was a pleasure to be around. I would like to give a couple of shout outs to Mr. Mohamed and Mr. Nour. These two gentlemen took the time to make sure my stay in the city would be the best it could be from giving insight into how to haggle in the souks to just making sure even the littlest things were perfect. They were there whenever I needed them and were always the epitome of graciousness.

The whole riad highlighting Moroccan architecture and vibe is aesthetically pleasing and they are conveniently located in the medina minutes away from attractions and some of the best restaurants in Marrakesh. The Hammam & massage at this riad was also really good! Would definitely recommend it!

Riad Melhoun & Spa,Nick M wrote a review Jul 2018,50,Wow! Not a single detail missed.,I stayed with my partner at Riad Melhoun for 2 days and I can genuinely say they earned every bit of this perfect rating. The service is like nothing I’ve experienced before. Within a couple hours of booking Mohamed contacted me to make sure transfers were arranged and to see if we required anything special for our stay. Once we arrived we were given a very warm greeting some lovely tea and biscuits and tour of the Riad.    This place is really clean the rooms are impeccably presented and the common pool/lounge area is such a lovely place to chill out after a day of wandering the medina that we didnt want to leave. The breakfast is tasty (Moroccan style) and we opted for the dinner on the first night which was also fabulous.    The room was really comfortable also. A big thankyou to every single one of the staff as every day they go above and beyond to make everyone feel welcome and comfortable.

Riad Melhoun & Spa,Minty L wrote a review Jul 2018,50,The staff is the heart of this Riad.,We stayed at Ryad Melhoun for 3 nights in July 2018. The Ryad itself is very nice with a small pool a sunny roof terrasse and the possibility to get a massage on site. The place was clean and beautifully decorated. The room was not big but it was comfortable.    Location was also great with many good restaurants within a few minutes walk as well as the Jemaa el-fna square close by. It is close to the action while still being in a relatively calm area.    The only issue we've had with the room is that there was not door between the bed area and the restroom...not a major issue with us but it could be a problem for some people. The wifi is also not the strongest but it's a good reason to get away from the internet and visit Marrakech instead.    The strongest point about Ryad Melhoun has to be the staff. They are polite dedicated always smiling and give a very personnalised service especially Mohammed who gave is many good recommendations.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0mintyl
Riad Melhoun & Spa,CindyMcCain wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Riad Melhoun Grants Guests' Wishes with a Perfect Property and Pro Staff,From the moment I walked into Riad Melhoun I was treated as an honored guest. I loved the experience of this stay because the blend of Arabic- Andalusian architecture and music felt so familiar after living in Morocco and visiting southern Spain often. I loved Riad Melhoun because it too is a reflection of art and history– wood carvings stucco and design inspired by the Bahia Palace nearby and the Medersa Ben Youssef. I was thrilled with the superior Amessan suite making any woman feel like a princess with the canopied bed and gigantic decorative doors opening exclusively to the courtyard pool. On the second floor were seven other sumptuous rooms.    I enjoyed the rooftop where I read watched the sunset and had breakfast. I appreciated the attentive staff that made me feel as a solo traveler that I was never alone. On the pristine cloth sprinkled with rose petals dinner was served by the pool lit by lanterns.    Riad Melhoun also has a spacious spa offering massages and hammams. I booked Morocco's signature pleasure a hammam and throughly enjoyed it. The lady who did my hammam was a pro. For those new to this practice it involves lying on a hot stone bench in a marble room with dry heat like a sauna while water is poured over the client from a silver bucket. Next you are smeared on both sides with savon beldi (a blackish looking soap made with olive oil) then left ten or so minutes to relax allowing the heat and oil to soften the skin. Next the attendant scrubs away the top layer of dead flesh (which peels off in rolls) with a kess (a mit akin to sandpaper). The client is then covered in argan oil by Sens of Marrakech (a local organic fragrant line of products) and left again to “bake.” The attendant returns washes your hair and rinses your body. Finally lotion is massaged into the skin you are wrapped me in a robe in a cooler room and served mint tea.    I left refreshed and relaxed. Manager Mohamed--a pro-- booked me a Tuk-Tuk (auto rickshaw) that took me from the door of the hotel to my next destination in the medina. Riad Melhoun is located near the Mellah (Jewish Quarter) El Badhi Palace and Jemma Fna Square.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Nashville, Tennessee",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CindyMcCain
Riad Melhoun & Spa,Chris Patrick A wrote a review Jun 2018,50,This could be Marrakech’s best-value five-star experience,Pass through the unassuming door of Riad Melhoun and step into another world. From the chaos of seemingly-aimless traffic on often grim dilapidated roads and cobbled streets into the most striking of contradictions a tranquil and majestic inner courtyard.    Rays of sunlight filter down some absorbed into the wooden beams the rest mirrored off white-washed walls and the pool’s still water to brighten up the space in which modern lights never could. Nouri the Assistant General Manager and Mohammed the GM will humbly tell you that the importance of the sahridj a fountain or basin cannot be understated. Water a symbol of life in the dessert lands represents the vital life force of the house.    There aren’t many questions about the riad Marrakech or Morocco for that matter that you can’t ask them that they wouldn’t have a suggestion or an answer for. In fact all the staff will become your bastions the confidants you excitedly re-tell stories of your day to and your trusty guides for as long as you stay in Morocco.    Hotels don’t get more well-placed than this either although the South Medina is a relatively undiscovered underdeveloped neighbourhood it’s only a 5 minute bimble to the Bahia Palace 10 minutes will take you to Jemaa el-Fna square another 10 and you’ll be at The Secret Garden. A 15 minute “tuktuk” from the riad will take you to Jardin Majorelle Gare De Marrakech and the Supratour bus station.    Whatever your reasons are to come to Riad Melhoun whether it’s the photogenic central location the reviews of bed comfort or the breakfast you’ll stay for the people.,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Limassol City, Cyprus",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisPatrickA

We were greeted with mint tea (which was different than in the north we visited earlier) and got a very detailed explanation of what is to see nearby where we can eat etc. And I would like to point out that riad is located perfectly in the middle of medina in the walking distance to the most interesting attractions like El Badi Palace Bahia Palace Saadian Tombs or Marrakech souks (or Ben Youssef Madrasa which is currently closed for renovation).  The riad is very beautiful and our room was spacious and very nicely decorated.  But one of the best things about this riad is its staff - very helpful and so friendly they made us feel almost like at home.  Also one time we ate dinner there (royal couscous) and it was delicious.,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Poland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wojciechtoman

We where greeted on arrival by the manager Mohamed with mint tea. All the staff go out of their way they are welcoming friendly and nothing is too much trouble.The rooms are lovely the beds are very comfortable and every where is spotlessly clean. The breakfasts are filling with something different each morning. We had an evening meal there on our first evening which was delicious this was after we had both had a massage which was very relaxing after our journey. We both slept like babies that night. Riad Melhoun is wonderfully placed to explore Marrakech.  The morning of my birthday my partner had taken balloons and banners which the staff had put up they played happy birthday and all came out to sing happy birthday in 4 languages they had even got me a cake with my name on it.  I can not recommend Riad Melhoun enough if you are lucky enough to be able to book there you will have an experience to remember.

Riad Melhoun & Spa,Dana H wrote a review Apr 2018,50,Grace and Comfort with the Warmth of Home,First I have to compliment the staff at Melhoun. Each of them was sincere willing polite and every ready to serve. Communication was no problem as enough English was spoken by Mohammed the manager and those less fluent in English were willing put up with my broken French Spanish and sign language. The usuals go without saying—meticulously clean great food and service reliable wifi abundant hot water (very much needed after roaming the streets of Marrakesh). The rooftop of the riad and beutiful gardens and sitting areas and views of the city.The hammam experience was a treasure. The girls were modest respectful and very good at their art. (1 hr scrub & bath + 1 hr. massage-50 dirham (basically $5). On arrival the handle to my suitcase had been broken by the airlines. No worries the boys opened up the lining of the suitcase and reattached the handle. (Try finding someone back home to fix things like this! And for free no less). The location of the riad was in the heart of the Medina and Mohammed was always ready to offer directions. And yes I would absolutely stay there again.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danahB5803OJ

Very comfortable and beautiful Riad with excellent facilities. The welcome and service from the team was amazing - very helpful and attentive when needed - they bent over backwards.  Great breakfast each day with varied local treats. We ate in one evening and probably should have done another as the food was excellent - probably the best I had in Marrakech. The courtyard is very calm relaxing and cosy and the rooftop terrace was great for breakfast and a drink at sunset.  The location is excellent with easy walking access to the whole medina but also easy to grab a taxi (a minute walk away) to get to other places in the city. Other places deeper into the medina might not be so convenient.

Riad Melhoun & Spa,Pattiwg wrote a review Feb 2018,50,Midnight at the Oasis (send your mule to bed!),We received a warm welcome at Riad Melhoun a gorgeous Riad in a perfect location in the medina walking distance to all of the recommended attractions. We stayed in Gaya suite which was beautifully decorated - the bed was very comfy and it may have been something to do with the peace quiet and pitch dark in our room but I’m not sure I’ve slept anywhere so soundly apart from home in a long time!  The bed linen was changed daily as well as the towels which felt like a real treat getting between fresh clean sheets every day (and I managed not to stress over our carbon footprint!). Breakfast on the terrace was a lovely start to the day (maybe a bit carb-heavy but the Marrakechi’s like their broad range of pancakes and pastries!) and although the Hammam might not have been as beautiful as some of the bigger ones in the area it was fantastically relaxing to just leave our room in our robes and Crocks for a lovely Hammam and massage and then float back along the corridor again!    We took the day trip to Imlil and had the best time - a car ride to a women’s Argan oil co-op a mule ride up a snow capped mountain a delicious home-cooked lunch on a private terrace with incredible views and then a (rather strenuous!) walk back down the mountain with our guide Hassan. We were truly ready for a glass of wine or 3 after that!    The heater (combined air-con/heating system) was fine in our room but it was a little chilly in the evenings in the Riad courtyard which didn’t encourage us to stay in though there was the offer of building a fire on a couple of occasions.  We ate at the Riad on our first night and the food was good but there is not a restaurant or bar as such. We enjoyed a glass of wine with dinner and also when we asked for a drink when we got back from our mountain trip but because it is not specifically set up for socialising in this way we saw very little of fellow guests and it did not encourage us to linger - overall however this did not mar our stay.    Assistant Manager Nour and the team looked after us very well warm informative helpful but always unobtrusive.

Riad Melhoun & Spa,Oliver Ohlendorf wrote a review Feb 2018,40,Perfect place for a stay in Marrakech,Outstanding service. Great experience. We were spending four days in Marrakech and we booked specially this riad because of the high recommendations. We arrived at the airport and got picked up by a transfer organised by the riad. Everything perfect. Mohamed the guest relation manager did a great job when he introduced us to the riad. We got an excellent dinner.    The reason for not giving five stars is the disadvantage I found about our ground floor room. The windows and doors are not really insulating the noise from the inner court of the riad. Because the other guests are eating sitting talking and listening to music just infront of the room - even though they are not beeing explicitly loud - the room cannot be called quiet. Since we spent only a few days here our programs started in the morning so we had to wake up rather early. I personally had difficulties to fall asleep until the guests went to rest and the music was turned off around 10:30 - 11:00 p.m. This should be considered if you are easily disturbed. I cannot tell if there is a difference in the other rooms on the upper floors since all of them face the inner court.    Also for me the french influenced very sweet breakfast is something I am not used to and I would probably not be happy with if I stayed a week or more...,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Male,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scubainstruc2r

Riad Melhoun & Spa,Sharon B wrote a review Nov 2017,50,"Best Riad in Marrakech: the location, the service, the pool!",Location  -This was the perfect location close to all the action (10 min walk to the Jemma plaza a couple mins walk to the Bahia Palace and 17 mins walk to Ibn Yusuf). Despite its proximity it is quiet and tranquil enough to get the best sleep at night.    Getting There  -Mohamed was so prompt in responding to my emails. He and Ahmed helped to organize a pickup and drop off at the airport. I highly recommend you do that. My friend and I avoided being lost in the windy alleyways of the old city dragging our suitcases down cobblestone streets. Knowing the logistics of pickup/drop off were taken care of set the tone for a stress-free vacation.    Arrival  -We were greeted with the most amazing spa-like smell upon arrival and were welcomed with mint tea and biscuits. Mohamed then provided a maps and gave us the info on what to expect in Marrakech. Luckily my friend and I had been in Morocco for over a week when we arrived at Riad Melhoun but you should definitely ask Mohamed any and all of your questions. He sets the stage and helps point out specific areas to check out. Seriously one of the best orientations I've experienced in all the hotels I've visited around the world. Side note: if you're using offline google maps to figure out where you're going I recommend you download maps.me it tends to be a bit more accurate in the medina.    Room  -The room was gorgeous so much love and attention to detail went into building this riad. We had double sinks so my friend and I could get ready at the same time. We stayed in Maysar which had the best view of the pool. Dipping in the pool at the end of a hot day walking around the souks was such a relief.  -There are some lounge areas to hang out by the pool and chill the relaxation vibe is apparent everywhere.    Breakfast  -Breakfast was included and we ate in the terrace. It was such a peaceful experience. All the food that was prepared was super delicious! Ahmed and Mohamed went out of their way to make sure we were fed even when we had an early morning flight or pickup planned.    Hamam and Massage  -On my last day of my trip I decided to book a private hamam and massage. Book it early. The girls who did the bath and massage were absolutely perfect and so sweet.    Service  -Outstanding service from the entire staff thank you all so much! I felt so taken care of and relaxed on my vacation in Morocco. I highly recommend you stay here!

It was my first time in Morroco and Africa and I am glad I picked this Riad.    Mohammed and Nour (the manager and the assistant manager) were ever so helpful and gave us tips on how to barter at the souks places to go to and what we should and shouldn't do in Morocco.    All the staff were ever so attentive and really made us feel at home.    The Medina is very chaotic all the time and although the Riad is in walking distance to pretty much everything it is so calm and peaceful and we felt almost at home the minute we stepped inside. We spent quite a lot of time chilling by the pool chatting to Nour and Mohammad when it was too hot to go outside.    If you're stopping for more than a day I'd highly recommend the massage and the Hammam. It never felt rushed like you feel at some spas.

The staff Mohammed Noor and Ahmed are lovely and so helpful and really happy to have a general chat about Morocco if they get chance.    The pool is quite small but big enough for a cool down in the afternoon! The communal area is spotless smells INCREDIBLE (orange blossom) and such a lovely place to chill in the heat of the afternoon.    Location wise we thought it was perfect as it was only 10 mins to the square and at night it was properly quiet for sleeping purposes.    Our room was spotless shower lovely and hot with excellent pressure and has shampoo/body lotion. Cleaned daily and new towels provided.    I really enjoyed my stay and do not hesitate to recommend it.,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Solihull, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/170katyb

The hotel is wonderful but it is the staff that make it outstanding. They do everything to make all the customers feel at home and to provide a place of comfort and tranquility from which you can explore Marrakech.    We ate most of our meals at the Riad. You have to book in advance because everything is bought fresh each day and you will not be disappointed. Every meal we had was delicious.    We also tried the Hammam and massage in the Riad and would recommend this to anyone    This Riad will be our first choice when we return to Marrakech,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Fareham,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pete1111
Riad Melhoun & Spa,Edgar P wrote a review Jun 2017,40,"Relaxing and comfortable, great service",My parents and I had a wonderful stay at the Riad Melhoun. The manager Mohamed was very attentive to our requests and always tried his best to ensure that we were happy with our stay. When we arrived he treated us to traditional Moroccan tea and cookies and he also gave us a tour of the Riad to help us feel at home.    Mohamed arranged transportation to and from the hotel and he also booked our camel tours at a nearby desert. Breakfast in the morning was delicious and filling served by a very nice server named Ahmed.    Overall a fantastic stay in Marrakesh in a riad that is close to the Bahia Palace and the main square Jemaa El Fna.

Riad Melhoun & Spa,mahfa386 wrote a review May 2017,50,Great Riad!,Riad Melhoun was a dream! The riad itself was beautiful clean and quiet.  The staff were very attentive and caring great breakfast in the AM cleaned room every day.  Mohammed and Nour were great managers making sure we had everything we needed and even explaining the map of the medina/marrakech. They went above and beyond our needs.  I would definitely stay at this Riad again it is very close to Bahia palace and an easy walk to the Jemaa El Fnaa. From the terrace of the riad you can see the Koutoubia mosque minaret and then the mountains on the other side.  The only thing I would caution is when you first arrive the taxi will drop you off at the Bahia Palace parking lot make sure you contact the riad to send you someone (and get their name) to escort you to the Riad; otherwise locals who pose as people from the hotel will escort you and then demand money.

Riad Melhoun & Spa,427amirulh wrote a review Feb 2017,50,Warm welcome in a beautiful Moroccan interior,Riad Melhoun was a great welcome to Morocco and Marrakech. Wouldn't have exchanged it for another place in the Medina.    Airport transfer: We were welcome at the Menara Airport by a transfer service which was seamless and convenient.    Arrival: Upon arrival we were welcome by Nouruddin with a pot of Moroccan mint tea. And he made us feel at home at once explaining a little background of Morocco as a country before showing us to our room.    Ambiance: I love the courtyard beautiful and yet feels very private. True Moroccan style.    Warmth: The staffers from Nouruddin Mohamed and Ahmed they were all very nice and helpful and speak good English. Made us instantly feel at home. Wish we could spend more nights at Melhoun to get to know Marrakech.

Riad Melhoun & Spa,LJIBrown wrote a review Jan 2017,50,Like being at home,I travelled with my husband 3 year old and my mum for a week. I read through a few of the reviews and would agree with comments that the approach of the Riad is not modern western approach i.e. not all bookable by a tick box on the internet. It is more one to one email Mohammed and he will do all he can to help. He arranged a transfer from the airport and they were there.    The actual Riad is in the Jewish quarter and you can walk everywhere. We got a guide through Mohammed for the first day which is highly recommended to get your bearings. Mohammed also had tips for the souk shopping etc.    The Riad has eight bedrooms (roof terrace and small plunge pool) and Mohammed and Noor (and the rest of the team) cannot do enough for you. My son slipped in the bathroom (my fault) but next day there were more floor mats. The bedroom Gaya has a small single bed which was fine for my son. I was offered a travel cot as well. My son wanted some fruit which I asked for assuming they would have it but when they didn't Mohammed popped out to buy it.    The food is really good for breakfast pancakes bread jam etc. Dinner is also good and varied like home cooking and Friday is a good night with music. A lot of the guests went out but you don't have to.    We also had a hamman and massage which was about two hours for 50euro each. The hamman is in the Riad.    All in all it was a great experience like being at home but with great service. Mohammed never stops moving but everything is always done. I don't often write reviews and I don't want to appear gushing but the review is genuinely deserved and such service is rarely found nowadays.,Date of stay: December 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Milford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LJIBrown
Riad Melhoun & Spa,jbl2017 wrote a review Jan 2017,50,Wonderfull riad with exceptional personal service!,I spent 5 days / 4 nights at Riad Melhoun and it was an extraordinary experience. Mohamed the manager had arranged for someone to pick me up at the airport and take me all the way to the riad which made for an easy arrival in unfamiliar territory. The riad is such a pleasant place! Great architecture design and interior nice and calm. The roof top terrasse is spacious with chairs/tables sunbeds and lounge areas. The common area on the ground floor has relaxing alcoves and a soothing atmosphere. The pictures tell the story - just have a look... But as all the other reviews confirm the real gem of Riad Melhoun is Mohamed Nour Ahmed Naima and the other staff members. I have travelled quite a bit throughout the world but I have never encountered such exceptional and personal service! Mohamed truly enjoys people and strives to ensure you have the best time both when in the riad and in Marrakech. He provided me with very useful advise on where to go what to see where and what to eat - and also what things ought to cost (very useful)! For a first-timer in Marrakech the Medina can be a bit overwhelming but Mohamed's guidance took the edge of that and made my stay so much more enjoyable. And when my stomach on one occasion didn't entirely agree with the cuisine of the souk Mohamed personally went out and got me some easy-to-digest food stuff to remedy the situation. Priceless!  In the morning of the day of my departure (my flight was at 15:00) Mohamed had also arranged for a hammam and massage session in their on-site spa. Pure delight and a great way to relax before the trip home.  I highly recommend a stay at Riad Melhoun. Personally I will return to Marrakech and staying elsewhere is just not an option.

Mohamed was an amazing host: he welcomed us with Moroccan tea right upon arrival and he made us feel like home throughout our whole stay in the riad. He was so thoughtful kind and gave us some very useful tips about the city of Marrakech.  He also suggested a homemade dinner at the riad on our first evening which we accepted and it was totally worth it. We enjoyed delicious Moroccan food accompanied by some traditional music players that Mohamed organised as a surprise for us! He even danced to the music as well! We had such an amazing time that night.  On our last day we enjoyed hammam and massage in the riad. Very interesting experience too.  Breakfast was also very good and included in our booking. Fresh orange juice three different types of Moroccan pancakes bread coffee fruits...  I have to say that everything in the riad even the smallest details had been taken care of. The atmosphere was very authentic the rooms were spotless the bathroom was huge...

Riad Melhoun & Spa,Clive L wrote a review Oct 2016,50,An oasis in the red walls,I have read other reviews prior to booking Riad Melhoun and I am very pleased to see they actually took quite a bit of the feedback here to improve so if you read something that may not be too positive I can see they are actually making an effort to do it better.    My 5 day and 4 night stay in Riad Melhoun was a fantastic experience. Like other reviewers might have said it already the location of the Riad is very central but the convenient didn't bring the noise with it so it's perfect for city explorations. Some said the spot seems sketchy I kinda understand because of the sudden remote feeling of that spot but I never felt threaten or insecure walking in and out if it really is it's just like any other part of Marrakech.    Service is superb Mohamed and Nour speaks English well and Ahamed can understand some but the language is only secondary to the warmth they show in their service. They want you to feel well and make sure you are ok and get everything you need when you go out or have breakfast or just being in the riad in general. They check on you a lot and are almost always available for anything. When I dipped myself in the pool they will provide towel I can request tea to be served at certain time in certain place they are always on point.    Rooms are not exactly spacious unless you take the suites but you get what you pay for and I felt completely fine and comfortable staying in the room. A/C works well shower restroom heat lamp all work as they should. Shower gel and shampoo are there they change towels or at least tidy them up. Yes they do go in even if you lock the room but I know they are doing it to make sure you come back to a tidy room with some of the stuff reset to a good shape.    Something remarkable about this place or Moroccan people to say is that they keep their words very well. I requested a desert visit thru them and whatever they have promised to me actually happened. This may sound strange but given the way they do not use a computer system or without any paperwork to mark anything not even my name I don't actually know how some of the verbal ideas materialized. BUT THEY DID! So both my wife and I were impressed.    As for the beauty of the riad I think the photos you see are all very realistic representation of the place. Nothing to hid or anything. Keep it that way. I love the pool. I still miss it.    The dinner I had on the first night of my visit was wonderful. I love the food so much it gave me and my wife such a memorable experience because we were greeted by the excellent reception on our first night. I recommend you spend at least a night there to have dinner they have surprises for you. The mint tea is also fantastic it soothed my mind so much just to taste that.    Suggestions for improvement:  1. Actively provide details of the info for guest online/email instead of just responding to questions when asked. This is because we may not know why some info are not communicated and people may feel insecure or the trust level may drop. After all a trip to Morocco can be quite wild in some the travelers' minds. We want to know as much as possible basically your whole menu book!    2. Trip communication can do better. Like I mentioned about I had no security whatsoever before the trip and I basically just let it flow and go with it. I didn't know the price I paid will give me what I was told. Even though in the end they did happen I'd think as travelers we want more guarantee than that.    Overall thank you for being great. I recommend this place for sure.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/456clivel

The location is great -- right in the medina about a block away from the beautiful Bahia Palace but far away enough from the main square and the souks to not be too crazy. The breakfast was delicious especially that homemade yogurt -- I still think about it! We had dinner one night and it was also pretty amazing.    But really the highlight of our stay was the wonderful staff. Mohamed was the friendliest person I've ever met at a hotel and all of his tips on how to get around Marrakech how to avoid being scammed what to expect to pay for taxis etc. were so helpful. We were the only people in the riad at the time so he upgraded our room and on our last day let us do a late late checkout (3 pm!) free of charge. I've never encountered this level of hospitality.

Riad Melhoun & Spa,KiwiinNorway wrote a review Oct 2016,50,Beautiful riad and wonderful service,Right from the time of booking we were extremely well looked after by Riad Melhoun & Spa – it seemed that nothing was too much trouble for Mohamed and all the staff. As soon as we arrived we felt very welcome we were offered mint tea and an introduction to Marrakech and Moroccan culture. We were given maps told about many attractions and activities to visit and were given helpful tips about bargaining in the souks and acclimatising to local food before trying the street stalls. It was clear that making sure guests had the best possible experience of Marrakech was a high priority.  The riad is in a great location – short walking distance to the main square and souks as well as many other attractions. I do recommend organising arrival transport from the airport through the riad though as it’s not so easy to find your way around at first.  Inside the riad is peaceful and calm you would never know that the busy medina is just outside. We stayed in Amessan room (suite) which was clean really spacious and beautifully decorated. This room is located on the ground floor beside the pool.  Food at the riad was also amazing – breakfast was included and changed a little each day I really enjoyed trying all the different types of Moroccan crepes. We also had dinner at the riad on the Friday evening which was delicious and a there was lot of food!  The riad also has a hammam which we booked for just before our flight out this was a nice relaxing end to our stay.  Overall the riad itself is very beautiful but it is really the wonderful service and personal touch which makes for a great experience. We would definitely visit again if we’re lucky enough to return to Marrakech!,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Oslo, Norway",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KiwiinNorway

Riad Melhoun is an oasis of calm cleanliness and hospitality hidden just off one of Marrakech medina's bustling noisy and dusty streets. Mohammed Nour and the team will welcome you with open arms (and fresh mint tea) and the entire riad is just a perfect sanctuary. It's a really great location too - not far from the main square and souks and the top floor balcony means you can enjoy the sunshine from a number of lounge seats.    This hotel is particularly good for couples - quiet romantic and perfectly placed for exploring more of Marrakech.

Riad Melhoun & Spa,LCork2 wrote a review May 2016,50,Beautiful & Peaceful Escape,The Riad Melhoun is an absolutely beautiful and quiet escape in a convenient location in Marrakech. I cannot say enough about the hospitality the staff showed us during our stay. They helped us book two tours one three day to the Sahara and another to Essouara at fair prices. We were given information on sites to see locations directions and tips on how to negotiate in the busy Souks. The staff went above and beyond in making sure we had everything we needed and made us feel at home. The Riad is very clean and the food was delicious.    If you are visiting Marrakech for the first time I would make sure to have a good understanding of where the Riad is located in relation to the larger streets. The alley ways within the city are winding and often taxi drivers do not know exactly where things are located but will get you close. Make sure to have the address and contact information for your Riad upon your arrival to the airport in case your taxi driver needs to contact them to help get you there.,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LCork2
Riad Melhoun & Spa,Charlie P wrote a review May 2016,50,Wonderful Riad in Marrakech,We stayed here for two nights recently and could not have had a more pleasant stay. The riad is beautiful clean and an incredibly relaxing spot in the frenetic pace of Marrakech. Located just steps from the Bahia Palace the location can't be beat. The rooms are a little small at least ours was but they have everything you could need. We also found it more enjoyable to take advantage of the idyllic courtyard and terrace with perfect views of the city.    Breakfast is fantastic with the freshest juices and Moroccan breads that one could ask for. We never ate dinner at Riad Melhoun but if the breakfast was any indication I'm sure dinner is well worth it.    Above all Emma and Noureddine made our stay just perfect. With helpful recommendations quick service and consistently friendly attitudes it's very clear that they take pride in Riad Melhoun and the happiness of their guests. Kudos to them would absolutely recommend and return.,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/789charliep
Riad Melhoun & Spa,Maureen M wrote a review Apr 2016,50,Lovely Oasis in Marrakech,This was one of the best places we have stayed anywhere not just Marrakech. The location was great - it is not in the souks where you have to haul your luggage for 10 or 15 minutes - but just outside maybe two short blocks to a taxi. But you can walk everywhere (the Bahia Palace was less than five minutes). The staff was wonderful and the room was pristine. The photos are very accurate; the courtyard is beautiful and the rooftop terrace is a pleasant place to have breakfast or perhaps an afternoon nap. But the breakfast was amazing - something different every day made fresh that morning. Emma is a lovely hostess and always concerned that everything was perfect. Nour and Mohammed could not do enough for us. We are fortunate to have found this riad and many thanks to previous reviewers for leading us to Riad Melhoun.,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maureenm623

Riad Melhoun & Spa,Darwin1080 wrote a review Jan 2016,50,Superb Riad,You have probably already discovered there are dozens of Riads to choose from but if you are anything like us you are finding it difficult to know which one to choose. If so you need look no further. This was the second of two Riads we stayed in and it was fair superior to the first one in almost every respect.  We had a tremendously warm welcome from Emma who served us mint tea as we filled in the obligatory paperwork which you have to do wherever you stay in Morroco. The Riad is immaculate and beautifully presented. We stayed in the Gaya suite which was gorgeous.The Riad is easy to find in a quiet location but is only a 5 minute walk from the Djemaa el Fna (main Square) via a pleasant souk. It is also close to many attractions restaurants and bars. We walked to everything. Breakfast consisted of Morrocan pancakes crepes bread jams fruit cake orange juice and coffee. We were served by Mohammed who is as many of the other reviewers have already said just lovely. He is incredibly friendly and helpful without being intrusive. We had an evening meal at the Riad which was the best meal we had on our week long trip. We are not really into spas but we wanted to experience a hamman and we took the opportunity to have one here which we followed with a massage. The facilities were excellent and the service professional.  Would I stay here again? Yes definitely - we loved it. I'm usually tempted to try somewhere new but in this case I would be too worried that it would fall short and I would be disappointed.,Date of stay: January 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Shrewsbury, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Darwin1080
Riad Melhoun & Spa,ExplorerGirl00 wrote a review Jan 2016,40,Lovely stay in a beautiful & convenient place,There are many reasons to stay here:  - Beautiful decor very tastefully done and maintained - common area room etc.  - Charming service especially Mohammed. He had the best attitude desire to please and energy of anyone I have seen in my many years of travels. His positivity was truly commendable. The owner and other staff members also worked hard and tried to make our stay very comfortable.  - 5m walk to Djemma el Fna. Place was easy to find and close to many of the other sites. We walked almost everywhere from this riad.  - The suite on the main floor was a nice sized room with big bathroom (and heat in the bathroom!). Comfortable bed very clean place loved it.    While I give this 4-stars b/c we had a wonderful stay some small issues that kept it from being a 5-star review:  - We signed up via email for the riad's NYE dinner and agreed to it only if it could be prepared vegetarian (even specified in the email that we eat dairy/eggs but not seafood fish etc). However on NYE the first course served had beef ham and seafood. It took 1/2 dozen conversations with the staff just to get them to remove the plates and we never got that course. Instead we got an extra big helping of the salad course that followed (we didn't know that until we pointed out that a course was missing). No apology.  - I also enquired earlier that day about whether alcohol was served (she said yes a glass of white wine at the beginning and champagne at midnight) and where we could buy a bottle of wine to have that evening (the owner told me we could buy it directly from the riad no worries). When we sat to dinner all the other guests had martini glasses. When we were asked if we wanted alcohol or no alcoholic drinks we said alcohol - but instead we got virgin juice cocktails. Not the wine that was mentioned and not the martinis everyone else had. That also took several conversations with the staff/owner just to get a glass of wine. Later we had to really flag them down to order the bottle of wine - there was no showing us a menu vague details on the prices and choices etc. And again no apologies no extra glass of wine to make up for the mistakes just smile and move on. Not a great start to NYE celebration but it did all work out after that and we had a nice evening.  - When we checked out the bill was in Euros. We only had local dirham to pay (by credit card) and they gave us a really awful exchange rate. We tried to gently question it but then just let it go b/c we wanted to catch a train and didn't want to end our stay on a sour note. I suggest guests ask ahead what currency the differences charges will be in (taxes in local dirham dinners and wine and airport pickup in Euros) and pay accordingly vs. combining into one bill and getting a ripped off by their poor exchange rate.,Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/explorergirl00

We were wrong! this Riad is simply stunning the decoration respects the authenticity of the place whilst giving the guests great comfort. It has a nice seating area at the ground floor with different decoration styles and an open fire giving great aromatic smells in the Riad. The terrace offers different positions whether you want to sit down lay down or on a long chair under the sun or in the shade the choice is Yours!  The staff are amazing - starting with Emma the manager she has good knowledge of the surroundings and can give good advice she is always smiling and available if we needed anything. She even joined us for a cup of tea and we had a good chat. Mohammed and Noureddine looked after us with a big smile and big hugs with the kids - we felt like we were part of the the same family - they were very nice and truly amazing hosts.

Riad Melhoun & Spa,mgw wrote a review Oct 2015,50,By far the best place we stayed not only in Morocco but anywhere,Have been traveling for about fifty years I rate Riad Melhoun as the best place I have stayed anywhere. We would come back to Morocco just to stay at this wonderful place. It is located in a quiet neighborhood near Bahia Palace. It is a two or three minute walk to a car park and it does not take long walking to get to the main plaza. The owners are to be commended for the impressive restoration of this riad. A lot of attention was paid to restoring it with an enormous amount of carving painting and tilework. Aside from a small modern pool in the courtyard the emphasis was on traditional architecture and features. Do not expect to see trendy or faddish decorations or furnishings. Our room was excellent and comfortable and we slept well. What made our stay at Melhoun so nice was the manager Emma and her staff. Nour and Mohammed are wonderful and although we did not become personally acquainted with the ladies they were always friendly and attentive. Although the riad does not operate a regular restaurant they provide excellent breakfasts with a lot of diversity and can prepare dinners with adequate advance notice. We had a wonderful dinner on our evening of arrival and also participated in a special dinner put on by the riad that included music by a noted Cuban musician. The food at the riad was superior to that in most restaurants. For breakfasts we were provided with items that we did not see anywhere else in Morocco. As mentioned before the riad is in a quiet location and the riad itself is quiet but do not expect the same sound insulation in a centuries old building as we find in the most modern hotels. The staff goes out of their way to minimize any noise or disturbance.    I take exception with an earlier review that complained of unanticipated charges at check out time. The information provided by the booking service I used clearly advised:  You'll be asked to pay the following charges at the hotel:  •A tax is imposed by the city: EUR 2.30 per person per night    We were also advised before check out about the city tax. Even though we prepaid for several hotels in Morocco we paid this type of tax each time. This tax not being included at booking is a Morocco issue and Riad Melhoun should not be criticized in particular. We found the staff honest and straightforward about everything.    I most highly recommend Riad Melhoun for a great stay in Marrakech.,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Michigan,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chali9

Riad Melhoun & Spa,George B wrote a review Aug 2015,30,The riad is really great. Issues with charging when checking out,"The riad is really nice. People working there are friendly and the breakfast is really great.  On the other hand the unpleasant surpise was when we checked out:  1) the employee told us that the amount to be paid was about 80 euros more than the one agreed ""due to taxes"". I showed him the confirmation email saying that the agreed price was with taxes included. He agreed and re-estimated the amount. The new amount was 50 euros more than the agreed price. The justification they gave is that ""somewhere in their website it states that there is that additional fee"". I wonder why don't they mention it in their confirmation emails.  2) The employee charged our credid card more as he used a worse exchange rate! About 30 euros more were charged in my card obviously because the employee did not use the correct rate.

The Riad itself is absolutely beautiful. In the mornings (for breakfast) and at the end of afternoons we stayed in the roof terrace. Then in the evening we would go down to the courtyard and read/relax until we were ready for bed. I cannot stress enough how enjoyable that was!  But the best part of the Riad was the staff. Samir was very warm an welcoming and upon our arrival gave us a great introduction to the city pointing out in the map great suggestions for restaurants and sights. Mohamed was absolutely incredible constantly making sure we were ""perfect""! He even taught us some arabic and became a good friend hopefully for life! And I urge you to have dinner there once Mohamed's tagine was beyond words!  The breakfast was also great a great selection of typical Moroccan dishes. Every day there was at least one dish new to try and the variety was great. It consists mainly of breads cakes pancakes jams and orange juice.  The Medina is a crazy place and to experience a proper Riad you need to stay in the Medina. We walked quite a lot (never took taxis) and I have to stay our location was the best.

We prebooked a taxi transfer through Samir (Riad manager) and were picked up by a very friendly driver who took us directly to the Riad where Mohammad was waiting to greet us. We had a very warm welcome as Mohammad gave us a tour of the Riad and served us some lovely mint tea.  As our flight arrived late in the evening we also arranged to have dinner in the Riad and this was ready for us on arrival. The food was exceptional! We were served a number of delicious starters followed by the lamb tagine which was also amazing!  The food throughout our stay was really tasty and there was always lots to eat at breakfast so we rarely had lunch as we were still full up!  Samir greeted us the next day and provided us with maps and useful information for our first time in Morroco. We were also able to arrange trips through the Riad which meant that we the same friendly driver who showed us extra bits of the city.  Samir also upgraded our room to a suite for free which was a lovely gesture and made our trip extra special! All of the rooms in the Riad are immaculate very private and beautiful. They are cleaned on a daily basis by the lovely ladies and they truly are one of the nicest and cleanest places we have ever stayed in! This is also true for the rest of the Riad where both the pool area roof terrace and seating areas are very clean comfortable and pretty!  This really is a beautiful tranquil and luxurious place to stay amidst the hustle and bustle of the medina which is made even better by the fantastic staff.    Samir and Mohammad are excellent and very gracious hosts. They both went above and beyond our expectations and nothing was ever too much trouble. Mohammad was always smiling and joking with us and also took the time to teach us a few Arabic phases which we will continue to practice!!  Samir was also very kind and friendly and provided us with some lovely sweet treats for our return journey which was very thoughtful and much appreciated. The female staff were both very friendly always smiling and made us feel very welcome throughout our stay. I would also like to thank them for all of the delicious breakfasts and the dinner prepared for us on our first night as it was all amazing!

We were also able to book tours to farther parts of Marrakech and the Atlas mountains through the riad. They took care of everything and customized the day's schedule with all the places we were interested in.    Breakfast was fantastic. We had authentic Moroccan food made for us every morning.

Riad Melhoun & Spa,Jules K wrote a review May 2015,50,Beautiful Riad - the perfect sanctuary in manic Marrakech,My daughter and I spent a wonderful three nights at this riad and would highly recommend. From the second we stepped through the door we were made to feel so welcome and encouraged to treat this gorgeous place as our home. A special thank you to Mohammed who is the most accommodating and friendly host ever! Nothing was too much trouble and he seemed genuinely interested in our welfare and did everything he could to make sure that our holiday was perfect from start to finish.    We stayed in the Dihya room which was very comfortable and a good size. Everything was spotless fluffy towels pristine white sheets air conditioning and a good hot shower with shampoo and shower gel provided. There was even a bottle of water provided free of charge each day and a good wifi connection. There was a safe but we felt so secure here that we never used it. The room was kept immaculate during our stay a big thanks to the cleaning staff. Rooms in riads are often dark but ours was quite pleasant having a small window onto the landing area. The riad was built in 1800 and the architecture is beautiful easily comparable with the palaces we visited. We slept well although with the window open you could hear the call to prayer early morning but this only added to the experience. The public areas of the riad are amazing. Cosy little seating areas where you can chill out a beautiful pool and a gorgeous sun terrace with sun loungers.    Breakfast was served wherever we wanted so we took full advantage and enjoyed it around the pool and also on the roof terrace. Fresh juice coffee pastries bread preserves yogurts and traditional moroccan pancakes etc set us up for the day. It would have been nice to see some fresh fruit is the only improvement we would suggest. The great thing was that we could enjoy breakfast at our leisure - there were no set times so we could lie in if we wanted to. We also enjoyed a three course meal one evening served around the pool by candlelight. A beautiful experience for only 20 euros per person. Pity there is no alcohol but we didn't come to Marrkech to get drunk (luckily)!    We also enjoyed a Turkish hammam and massage at the riad - highly recommended! Very relaxing and authentic experience being bathed with warm water moisturised with traditional olive oil soap an invigorating body scrub and relaxing full body massage!    Be warned - the riad is difficult to find Marrakech is a labyrinth of little streets and passages and hard to navigate. If you get a taxi from the airport don't pay more than 50 dirhams. Some try to charge as much as 150 but walk away and they will drop their prices! Also the taxi drivers will only be able to drop you at a certain point fairly close to the riad but not to the door! Vehicles cannot access a large part of the medina due to the narrow streets. You will need a good map and sense of direction to be able to locate the riad.    Marrakech is a wonderful vibrant city but you will need to haggle hard for every purchase you make - they try to take full advantage of the naive tourist. A knowledge of French is useful and we found this came in handy during our stay.    We would recommend the palaces Bahia and Badi which are both 5 mins walk from the riad. La Place is approx 7 mins walk as is the famous mosque. We walked everywhere apart from Majorelle Gardens which is a short taxi drive away. Enjoy Marrakech and make sure you give Mohammed our best regards - he really went the extra mile to make our stay extra special and made us feel very welcome and at home.,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,Manchester,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jul13k

Riad Melhoun & Spa,audiophileclasse wrote a review Apr 2015,50,An Oasis of Calm,I stayed here last year for a week and had a wonderful time. On arrival we had a local meal specially prepared for us in a beautiful serene setting in the courtyard. Quality of food was great and service was Rolls Royce. I enjoyed warm and hospitable service from all members of staff throughout my entire stay. Even our overnight tour to Zagora and the desert was very well organised by the hotel. Needless to say I was absolutely satisfied and would recommend this riad without any reservation.    Note: I had the privilege of staying in the largest room but please note that some of the other rooms are typical of the average riad i.e. not necessarily the most spacious.,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/audiophileclasse
Riad Melhoun & Spa,lesley d wrote a review Apr 2015,50,Beautiful Melhoun,My sister and I stayed in Riad Melhoun this spring and loved it. The riad is beautiful and contains traditional Moroccan decoration as seen in the Bahia palace. Our room was delightful and kept clean and attractive throughout our stay. The riad location is very good close to Medina attractions but peaceful. The staff not only demonstrated great hospitality and thoughtfulness but also assisted with the practicalities. Special thanks to Hicham & Mohammed. The March weather was disappointing but it was fantastic to come back to Riad Melhoun and to be welcomed in by Mohammed who proceeded to light the fire for us and make sure we were comfortable. The breakfasts were delicious and varied each day. We also made use of the riad spa which was wonderful. Liked Best - the staff and their dedication to making our stay enjoyable. Liked Least - strange smell on entering the Gaya suite. Although even this was much improved with some orange flowers from the pretty roof terrace.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Reading, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lesley375
Riad Melhoun & Spa,born2travel123 wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Simply outstanding,My husband and I are still in awe of the wonderful experience we had in Marrakech. Riad Melhoun and the wonderful staff played a large part in this. We were taken so well care of from the airport pick-up to the drop-off. Mohammed and his staff are absolutely amazing in his service mindedness. He helped us with everything from maps to booking of food classes and spa treatments. The riad is beautiful and well kept. The pictures don`t really do it justice. And the food is just AMAZING. We actually had dinner there every night of our stay and couldn`t have been happier. I went to bed dreaming about the lovely breakfast and finished breakfast looking forward to dinner. We had a small issue with an overbooking of our suite but this was handled professionally and kindly and it did in no way ruin our stay. I would also like to recommend the hammam and massage. We thoroughly enjoyed it. If you are lucky enough to visit the beautiful city of Marrakech you would be smart to book this Riad. We will most definitely be going back.

Riad Melhoun & Spa,Rachel S wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Quiet paradise,We chose to stay at the Riad Melhoun mostly based on the incredibly positive reviews and accounts of the staff and also the gorgeous decoration shown in the photos. I’m so glad we did and even with these expectations we were blown away by how welcoming and beautiful a place it was to stay.    Typically we stay in very simple budget accommodation and just use it as a base to explore wherever we are holidaying and feel like it’s a waste to fly all the way to another country only to spend most of your time in a hotel or beside a pool. However this Riad was a perfect middle ground for us as feeling so traditionally Moroccan and personal we felt even when relaxing here we were still experiencing authentic Marrakech. Also being fairly small and intimate the staff are always around should you have any questions or problems but you also feel completely free just to relax without any intrusion or needing to fit to any timetable. You are asked and made to feel truly at home.    Location: the Riad is perfectly situated for exploring the medina and main sites and attractions around it. We spend most of our time exploring the souks and Jemaa el Fna which are minutes away and the Palace Badii and Bahai are also a very short walk. For convenience I suggest arranging a taxi collection from the airport through the Riad. While it is close to the Jemaa el Fna unless you know exactly where it is it could take a very long time to find. There are plenty of taxis outside the airport but they will probably not know where it is (our driver needed to ask a few people about the address we had written down) – and they will only take you to the nearest drop off and then you will likely be approached by someone offering to guide you who will typically expect payment. Despite being so central it is incredibly quiet a real tranquil paradise to come back to after the souks and scooters.    Quality of Sleep: The rooms are decorated to a very high standard and kept immaculate but also retain that sense of homeliness. As someone very sensitive to dust and feather allergies I had no trouble getting a fantastic night’s sleep every night and wasn’t disturbed by noise despite our room (Lunja) being on the roof. I only heard the pre-dawn call to prayer on the first night.    Facilities: Some websites and blogs suggest taking toilet paper or a sink plug when visiting Marrakech but this wasn’t required at Riad Melhoun. They provide really lovely Shampoo and Shower gel plenty of towels and an extra blanket. If you need a hairdryer just ask a member of staff. There is an A/C unit but we didn’t need to use it. Our room had a small built in wardrobe with plenty of space for our luggage and hanging our clothes and also housed a small safe. There is a also a Hammam which comprises of a room with two massage beds and a second spa room which can be heated on request with enough given notice – sadly we didn’t end up making use of it this time so I can’t comment much more on it.    Room: We stayed in Lunja which is on the roof so really convenient for relaxing in the sunshine and just being able to pop in and out. It was really peaceful and we were never disturbed by people breakfasting on the roof or other comings and goings. The other rooms are all situated around the central courtyard/pool with one on the ground floor and six on the first floor. Our room was a modest size but absolutely fine for us – however I would note that while most rooms have a separate bathroom with a door the Lunja does not. We guessed this might be the case from the photos provided and didn’t have much problem with it but if you’re not quite comfortable with that arrangement then opt for another room.    Food: Breakfast is provided and was served whenever we happened to get up. The quality variety and amount you are given is incredible. It was absolutely delicious and set us up for the whole day so we often didn’t eat anything until the evening. Typical example would be juice coffee bread and jams a small plate of pancakes slices of cake a honey polenta style cake and some yogurt with fruit. I also highly recommend having at least one evening meal at the Riad. Most nights we ate at the stalls in the Jemaa el Fna but if you want to treat yourself the Riad will 99% of the time will be a better price and quality than restaurants. We had dinner here on the first night it was so much food we couldn’t eat all of it and included a really nice salad and wonderful filo/pancake dessert and cost us 20 euros each. We also visited a restaurant recommended in a guide book later in the week which was absolutely disgusting.    Staff: The staff at Riad Melhoun is what makes it such a genuine pleasure to stay here as is evident from previous reviews too. We were greeted by Youseff (the manager) when we arrived who then introduced each member of staff to us which was very humbling. We were given a tour of the Riad and Youssef explained the recent renovation the style of traditional Riads and how we should feel absolutely at home. We were then brought tea and were told a little about Marrakech and its historical and cultural background and the things to see around the city. It was an incredible introduction and really set the tone for our stay as never have I really experienced such personal service. Mohammed and Younes were always around if we needed absolutely anything at all. They are both really professional but also genuinely welcoming and kind you don’t feel like it’s just their job. Mohammed was always especially friendly asking how we were and was really happy to stop and talk. Regrettably we only speak English so occasionally explanations were difficult but for the most part this was absolutely no trouble at all we only felt bad that we couldn’t talk more with Younes as he is primarily fluent in Arabic and French I think although learning English and German soon. We promised to try and learn some French before our next visit. Also a huge thank you to the two girls we met (Hadija and I cannot remember the other name I’m sorry to say!) who prepared the most wonderful breakfasts and meals and took such care cleaning our room and making our bed differently each day everything was always perfect.    Tips/extras: There was a small mix up when it came to paying the bill at the end of our stay as I had only written down the booking details and had no printed confirmation and Youssef was away. There was a discrepancy between our booked price and the one presented and with language barriers this was quite difficult to resolve quickly so I recommend bringing along a print out of your booking confirmation just to make things easier as we should have done. I will also note there have been a few comments on here about being charged for things? When we got the bill we had only been charged for our room the meal we had and city tax but not for Mint Tea or anything surprising.  One especially lovely part of our stay was learning to make Mint tea exactly as they do. In conversation one evening Youssef offered for us to be shown how to make it and the next morning we were invited to the kitchen and had the process explained and then had a go ourselves and Mohammed even offered to film it on my camera. It was just a very personal and unique experience and shows the contrast to staying in a soulless hotel complex.    The personality and charm really makes Riad Melhoun stand out and without a doubt is where we will stay on future visits as we still have lots to see and do.  To stay somewhere quite so beautiful and quiet with such attentive and friendly staff in a small homely yet traditional Riad you could not get a better deal.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/212rachels

Riad Melhoun & Spa,Timothy R wrote a review Nov 2014,50,Quiet splendor in the heart of the medina,This riad really has the feel of a Marrakech courtyard home. In addition to your room you have access to the salon (a living room) and a small travel library and the plunge pool on the ground floor. Then two floors up is the rooftop terrace with tables and well-tended trees (orange and pomegranate and lemon). It's your choice to have breakfast up on the terrace or down by the pool and there's no cutoff time if you feel like sleeping late. The bedrooms are beautiful. Expertly done mosaic tiles everywhere even in the sink basins--I felt a little guilty brushing my teeth in what looked like a work of art. The shower was luxurious with no lack of high-end beauty products to complete the bathing experience. Nice and quiet at night and during the day you're a short walk to the Palais Bahia and a couple of museums. While touring the palais it occurred to me that my room at the Riad Melhoun was better than a room at the palace. The staff is also very friendly and informative. I changed my reservation at the last minute from a hotel in the nouvelle ville to this riad and I'm glad I did.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timothyr328

Rooms nicely decorated and well kept.    But what makes this place so special are the people so increadibly nice. Mohammed aways with a big smile on his face and making sure you have all you need. I really apreciated that he walked with me at 10 pm to get a take away the first night i got in and then set a table for us on the roof so when my friend arrived after midnight we could have a nice diner.

Riad Melhoun & Spa,VJag wrote a review Sep 2014,50,A home from home,There are so many postives about this fantastic riad. It was an oasis of calm to return to after the pace of Marrakech. The riad itself is nice and cool. Plus it has a wonderful plunge pool. In fact I found myself staying inside the riad for a whole day lounging next to the pool whilst I read a book and listened to the riad music. Bliss.    However I feel the riad's strongest 'asset' is the lovely people who work there. They are the ones who made me feel so at home. They all felt like family by the end of the trip. Youssef the manager was always available - either on the phone or in person - and was so helpful. On the first day he and I made a list of things I wanted to do. It was plain that he wanted me to have the best holiday and he very much put this first - which is why he devoted time to helping me research trips for which he could get no commission. I trusted Youssef. We often shared tea together. So when I ran into trouble on the last day of the trip he was the person I phoned for advice and assistance even though I was no longer staying there. Yet without hesitation he was ready to help.    Youssef was assisted by the always smiling and friendly Mohammed - the first person to greet me after I walked through the riad door. He and I would often chat about our respective days and life generally!    And finally but certainly by no means least the amazing Hadija (I apologise if I have misspelled your name!) the lady who prepared the most amazing dinner for my arrival as well as the tasty (and much too generous) breakfasts - available whenever you got up. You must have the dinner here at least once as Hadija is an amazing chef. Oh and she manages to keep the riad/bedrooms clean and tidy as well!    What was also notable was that I was regularly given tea snacks (bread with honey cakes biscuits etc) bottles of water. They cleaned my clothes. And I was never charged for these things even though I was expecting to be.    These are generous people who are trying to make your stay here amazing.    Finally in terms of practicalities I was able to email the riad with various queries prior to my arrival including arranging a transfer to the riad. Youssef promptly emailed me back and arranged everything. The transfer was inexpensive and took the stress out of having to bargain with taxi drivers upon my arrival. My driver also escorted me to the riad. I paid at the end of my stay (in euros as I arranged with Youssef - I was given various options in terms of currency). The riad itself is close to the main square about 5-10 minutes walk depending on your pace. You are fortunate that just around the corner from the riad is a taxi rank.    I would recommend you staying here. This is a 'true' riad - traditional architecture and the charm that I was hoping for. Relaxing and peaceful. Comfortable.

When we checked out we realised we had been charged for tea we was offered they had also changed the bill to euros with the currency exchange we ended up paying a lot more! Riad melhoun had ordered us a taxi when we left to go to the bus station for the next part of our trip the taxi man instead of charging 20 dirham which is expected for a 2 minute cab ride demanded 100 dirham saying we owed riad mehoun for commision as they had ordered us 2 taxis!

Riad Melhoun & Spa,Doreen2014Bristol wrote a review Mar 2014,50,Fantastic Riad in central but quiet location,We had a fantastic three night stay at Riad Melhoun - we felt welcome and taken care of from the moment we exited the airport (we had booked transfer with the Riad as we arrived fairly late - would recommend this especially if you arrive late at night as the driver walks you to the hotel as well cars can't get to the hotel and if you don't know where you're going it's not that easy as the hotel is difficult to find on the map and there are hardly any street signs as well). Youssef the manager sat down with us over tea and biscuits and talked us through the map first (very handy - it's fairly easy to find your way once you have a few buildings / squares you can use as orientation) and gave a few recommendations what to visit including places to eat. We had booked a dinner for the first night in the Riad and the food was amazing if you stay there make sure you book dinner for at least one night of your trip.    Everyone at the Riad looked after us so well from the breakfast served on the rooftop terrace (amazing Moroccon breakfast with a different selection every day with explanations what we actually get to eat) to mint tea whenever we got back to the Riad after long hours of exploring the city. We stayed in the Gaya suite which was beautiful and warm which is a big bonus for cold February nights in Marrakech!    We also booked a Hammam session and a massage in the private Hamman and treatment room in the Riad which was very enjoyable.    In short a beautifully restored Riad with great facilities in a quiet but central location (it's less than 10 minutes' walk to the main square) with fantastic staff and gorgeous food.

Beautiful and intimate space (only 8 rooms) every inch elaborately decorated with atmospheric music and rich exotic scent in the common areas.    Good location: on a quiet side street but still very close to the action.    Cons:    Hot water in our room was used up pretty fast - after about 5 minutes it turned lukewarm then soon cold.

Riad Melhoun & Spa,psutools wrote a review Nov 2013,50,Adorable Riad and Best Meal in Morocco!,There are a ton of Riads in Marrakech and choosing one can make your head spin! Now after being there and understanding the city I fully recommend Riad Melhoun. As with many other reviews it is a great Riad with a beautiful courtyard nice rooms and fantastic staff who go out of their way for you. But the reasons I would recommend it over other Riads to anyone going is because of it's location and food. Its location is ideal in a busy crowded city. It is extremely close to a taxi area which is key if you want to go anywhere outside of the Medina. It is also two turns off of a main street which takes you directly into the main square. It is impossible to get lost! No guide needed. As two females we felt it very safe walking back at night.    Finally and I can't stress this enough the food was amazing! It was the best meal we had in the 10 days in Morocco. I even tried ordering the same meal to compare and nothing came close. We had the Moroccan Salad and Kefte Tangine. Don't hesitate stay here just to eat here!,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/psutools
Riad Melhoun & Spa,psubrennan wrote a review Nov 2013,50,Amazing Riad in Marrakech,I recently returned from Morocco and spent 3 nights at Riad Melhoun. Our stay there was fabulous! The Riad is clean quiet and the staff couldn't have been more helpful or kind. Youssef checked on us everyday and answered our endless questions of things to see restaurants to eat at etc...Additionally the food at Riad Melhoun was the best I had in all of Morocco. You must not miss a meal there I promise you won't be disappointed. The location of the Riad is very easy to find and has easy access to main paths within the Riad. They treated us like family and make our trip to Marrakech very easy. I highly recommend to any traveler.,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/psubrennan
Riad Melhoun & Spa,MooreGold wrote a review Nov 2013,50,2 nights in Marrakesh,We stayed in several riads in Marrakesh and this was by far the best. The design was great and the staff very friendly and helpful. Before long it started to feel like our home away from home. The prices are fair and very generous and unlike some other riads you don't get charged for every cup of tea. You ll never feel lonely because the hosts are so friendly and accommodating. The wifi was good the rooms clean and my favorite spot was the rooftop terrace where you can tan and look at the city. The breakfast was very generous and the hosts are very accommodating to the guests needs. The location is very central and puts you in short walking distance to most of the major attractions and to the local spice market were you can shop like a native if you can pull it of.,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MooreGold
Riad Melhoun & Spa,Robertwales87 wrote a review Oct 2013,50,An amazing Riad,If you want to avoid the hustle and bustle of the streetside Riads but situate yourselves in a central location offering a great value for money this is the place.    We just spent a week there and couldn't have asked for more. They took care of airport transfers city taxis tours and gave great directions to the sites.    Youssef and Hischam were so friendly and approachable they always put you at ease. I'd recommend this Riad to families and couples.    Eating there is a MUST! It's the best meal we had in Marrakech by quite a distance! It's a 5/5 and an easy 9/10 without thinking about it.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robertwales87
Riad Melhoun & Spa,robincpearce wrote a review Jul 2013,50,A Great Riad in Marrakech,This is a newly renovated property in a central location within walking distance of many key sites. The Riad is lovely to look at clean and very comfortable well maintained with a host of amenities. The staff were always attentive and helpful.

Riad Melhoun & Spa,Lucy D wrote a review Jul 2013,50,Melhoun,My mother and I had the best holiday ever. The Riad is breathtaking and so peaceful after a few days staying there it began to feel like a second home. The staff were amazing we could not have asked for more helpful people. There was nothing that they weren't willing to do and the manager Youseff was so hospitable and great fun to talk to. Marrakech itself is such an interesting place to visit but what made the holiday so good for us was this Riad. We are talking of returning to Morocco again as we had such a good time and should we decide to stay in Marrakech again there is no doubt that we would choose to stay at Riad Melhoun. I strongly recommend this accommodation to anyone looking for an unforgettable holiday!,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lucyd418
Riad Melhoun & Spa,maggie amersham wrote a review Jun 2013,50,Super location with friendly owner,Although we didn't stay at this Riad we checked it out for our daughter who may visit next year. It is an absolutely brilliant location - away from the noise and hustle and bustle of the Medina.    The very kind owner gave us a drink on the pretty roof terrace after we had looked at the rooms and told us about the history of the building and the renovations to it.    We saw it in May but I lost his card and have just found it. Definitely a property to consider if visiting Marrakech. Authentic surroundings with a very friendly owner. I can imagine that the hospitality is very good.,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Amersham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/417maggie
Riad Melhoun & Spa,Virginia P wrote a review Jun 2013,50,Brilliant. Home away from home.,"4 days and nights in Riad Melhoun really made my time in Marrakech special. Great location beautiful accommodation wonderful quiet rooms and living areas fabulous hospitality. Excellent breakfasts and a most delicious meal was prepared for my sisters and I one night on request. After 4 nights away and a long drive back from my night in the Sahara I couldn't wait to get ""home"" to the peace and amenities of Riad Melhoun. Always peaceful after a day out in Marrakech especially having some quiet time to relax by the indoor pool or on the roof. The staff were really attentive friendly and helpful.. The manager Youseff was just wonderful.

Riad Melhoun & Spa,lilglobetrotter wrote a review May 2013,50,Wonderful riad in the heart of the Medina,Just returned from 4 nights in Marrakech.  We wanted to experience the true Marrakech and so choose a riad in the medina rather than a large hotel in the new town. What a great choice we made.  From the moment we arrived we were made to feel totally at home. The riad is beautiful with lots of areas to relax and chill after a hectic day in marrakech! The roof terrace is perfect to catch a bit of sun and the plunge pool is perfect to cool down. The riad has a perfect location about 8mins wals to the main square down bustling side streets.  We stayed in the Gaya suite which is stunning; with plenty of room. Highly recommended.  Breakfast each day was a real treat... lots and lots of food coffee and fresh juice. Each day we got to try a different kind of morrocan pastry or cake. No time restrictions on when breakfast was served either... one day we ate at 7am another at 10am and this was fine.  The staff are wonderful... Yousseff the manager arranged transfers for us and an excursion to the Atlas mountains. He was very friendly and always on hand with any questions we had. The other staff were wonderful too very friendly and welcoming even though we couldnt always understand each other! :)  I would recommend the Riad Melhoun 100% and I will be back.,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Chester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lilglobetrotter
Riad Melhoun & Spa,Tjalling O wrote a review May 2013,50,Truly unforgettable and incomparable experience,In a nutshell this riad is an unforgettable and incomparable experience. At first the staff's story about the guesthouse transforming into a true home feels like a well-thought-out sales spiel but by the end of my stay it truly felt like a home away from home with the unique feeling of peace that is only achieved by unwinding in an fully familiar and safe environment. Questions like 'Don't we lock the doors?' quickly turn into 'Did I leave my laptop by the pool or on the roof terrace last night?'. In other words one can't help but be completely and utterly comfortable with each and every aspect of this riad.  The staff is nothing short of incredible and extremely helpful also when planning a thorough visit of Marrakech or any of its surrounding cities. The endless supply of fantastic Moroccan tea has fostered a delicious addiction that will remain with me as a lasting memory to some of my best days in Morocco or rather anywhere.  The riad has an agreement with a transportation firm to ensure low transfer prices to anywhere in the city even during high season or evenings when taxis ask for much higher prices. If one comes by car it is furthermore conveniently situated close to a parking lot (1-2 minutes walking).  Further superlatives will not do this riad justice and anyone that will visit it will agree that none of my story is exaggerated. Not even five-star hotels compare.,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Grenoble, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TjallingO

From the moment you walk through the doors you escape the hustle and bustle of the city. the courtyard is stunning the rooms are luscious and quiet. Breakfast is incredible!

Riad Melhoun & Spa,TravelingQueen2013 wrote a review Mar 2013,50,Home Away From Home,The moment we entered Riad Melhoun we were at home. The atmosphere along with the spectacular staff were better than any I have ever experienced. Youssef and his staff succeeded in making this one of the best vacations I have had. The rooms at the Riad Melhoun were comfortable and quiet. The meals that we ate there were superb and we never left the table hungry. Youseff and his staff made sure we were well fed always had plenty of tea and coffee and even took the time to plan a surprise birthday party for two people in our group. The hotel was a hideaway from the hustle and bustle of the city streets and very conveniently located. I would recommend the Riad Melhoun to anyone who travels to Marrakech.,Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Calambrone, Italy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingQueen2013

Riad Melhoun & Spa,taryn615 wrote a review Feb 2013,50,Best in all of Marrakech!,I can't quite describe how heavenly Riad Melhoun is... The interior is a peaceful sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech and the level of service from Youssef and his staff is simply unrivaled. From the moment we arrived and were greeted with mint tea and pastries to the moment we left and the entire staff walked us to the nearby parking lot to wave goodbye every thing about our stay was just perfect. During the week we stayed there the Riad became our home away from home.    The location is perfect just 10 minutes walk to the center. The bedrooms and common areas are comfortable and beautifully designed. Breakfast is outstanding. I also suggest you book dinner at least one night while you're there to enjoy delicious home-made Moroccan fare at just 20-euro per person. We enjoyed a relaxing spa day with time in the hammam and massage. Youssef made several trip reservations for us -- a day trip to Casablanca and an overnight in the Sahara. He also organized a tour of Marrakech for us with an official guide from the Ministry of Tourism. If you're at all interested in seeing the city with a guide (highly recommended on your first day to get the lay of the land and understand the history of the city) make sure you request Mohammed!! We loved him so much we booked him for more tours later in the week.    Hands down Riad Melhoun is the best in Marrakech. If you're lucky enough to travel to Morocco don't miss this gem!,Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Caldogno, Italy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taryn615
