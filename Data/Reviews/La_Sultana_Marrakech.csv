La Sultana Marrakech,Dana N wrote a review Mar 15,50,Elegant and Tranquil,Our stay 5-day stay at La Sultana was absolutely delightful in every way. The hotel is beautiful historic and absolutely elegant. The staff were friendly welcoming polite and extremely helpful. The rooms feel very private as the hotel has many separate areas. Our room was just the basic rate room but is was spacious and comfortable with a gorgeous bath and shower area. When we arrived in our room there were fruits traditional Moroccan pastries and dates waiting for us as a snack. The concierge and staff expertly arranged all of our requested dining reservations and activities before we had arrived. We tried both the rooftop restaurant for lunch and the main restaurant in the central courtyard for dinner. The food was excellent. We had our best dinner in Marrakech there. Would definitely highly recommend this as a great place to stay.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dananL2278JD

La Sultana Marrakech,Holly L wrote a review Mar 7,50,Amazing retreat to explore and restore !,Everyone has their way of vacationing I mostly enjoy fly fishing adventure travel I was last in the African bush Eastern Tanzania but it’s not a vacation or very relaxing. When I am not working or in the bush/amazon jungles of Bolivia and Brazil I need to relax and restore - La Sultana has made it to the top of my list. The staff are excellent making me feel welcome and accommodating and the food was exceptional. I have had basteeya at Mourad in San Francisco and even his 5star dining while amazing couldn’t touch this or the orange blossom dessert with the traditional live music playing softly in the background. The rooms and spa were also fantastic and when I wasnt’ wandering around Marrakech - I found respite in the quiet roof call to pray with lunch then a late afternoon tea/cookies on the sun beds. I am not a big shopper and don’t need house things - so I arranged to be in the desert for 4 days and also loved that - Scarabea camp. La Sultana coordinated with their transportation and the end-end was very seamless for a week/two weekends as the perfect restorative vacation. As a single woman traveling alone - I loved it I was not remotely bothered when out in the city (I did cover my tattoos and wasn’t out at night) and believe as usual the internet exaggerates or perhaps the concerns are outdated. This is a great time to visit Marrakech the King has been amazing and the country is alive and welcoming - I had visited Tangiers last year and felt the same. Saida the concierge and generally awesome human being is the star of the show for La Sultana - she gave great advice and again helped end-end with everything. And the chef/food are not to be missed - even if you’re not staying at La Sultana - the roof deck during the day and the courtyard at night are not to be missed.,Date of stay: February 2023,,"Copenhagen, Denmark",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BanditLA

La Sultana Marrakech,Kirsten V wrote a review Feb 2023,50,The most amazing raid,This hotel is the most wonderful place we have stayed! The location is great for walking everywhere in the Medina. The architecture is stunning every raid is unique and different but each one is equally as elegant. We did the architectural tour of the hotel and loved it. The roof top is spectacular we went everyday sometimes twice a day for drinks or their delicious homemade ice cream. We did the sweets cooking class which was great fun. We booked all our excursions through the hotel and they were amazing their drivers and guides are first rate!! Our room was spacious enough for two with a large bathroom and beautifully decorated in fact it was perfect in every way. We ate at the hotel twice and enjoyed everything the food was delicious the atmosphere is very elegant and intimate. The absolute best part of our stay was the staff I don’t think I can convey the level of service at this hotel nothing is too much trouble the staff is always smiling and friendly we never encountered one staff member who’s service was not perfection. The staff make the hotel even more beautiful than it already is. Thank you Abdula for all your assistance and your warm smile everyday!!

La Sultana Marrakech,Will M wrote a review Feb 2023,50,An oasis of calm and beauty,What an amazing place everything about it breathtaking. A small alleyway leads off a typical manic Marakesh street to an oasis of beauty and calm.  We visited on a recommendation from a fellow guest at our hotel to have a Hammam and I'm so glad we went. The Hammam was amazing the staff fantastic.  We coupled this with a lunch in the restaurant which again I'd highly recommend. The rooftop is the place to be but even if it's not available the dining area is beautiful.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Moggsy72

La Sultana Marrakech,Margita - Glee of Life wrote a review Jan 2023,40,Tucked away at the heart of the Kasbah,We chose to stay in La Sultana for 3 nights while exploring Marrakech due to its perfect location tucked away at the heart of the Kasbah close to some incredible restaurants cafes and famous attractions (it is literally next to the historic sites of the Saadian Tombs and Jamaa El Fna Square is a 10-minute walk away).    Near the Royal Palaces La Sultana is a combination of 5 riads. A mixture of elegant and antique modern and old-fashioned. Our room had a very outdated feel to it we did not like the decor but I guess that is the style of that Riad - antique? The complimentary sweet treats made me actually sick I do not know what was in them so would not recommend eating them.    We enjoyed our traditional Moroccan mint tea by the pool on arrival very much!    The rooftop bar is excellent The cocktails were a highlight as the sunsets from the roof were beautiful. A place to escape for a drink or a few and soak in the ancient city views of Marrakech and the Atlas Mountains. The rooftop turns into a fairy tale of 1001 nights when the sun sets and the lanterns light up the terrace. The food selection was cosmopolitan and of high quality.    Sadly we didn’t have a chance to try their famous spa.    The check-out experience was not a nice experience but overall the staff were friendly and professional especially the porters!    A real hideaway right in the centre of busy Marrakech.,Date of stay: October 2022,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MargitaGlee

The rooms were incredible super comfortable spacious the most wonderful touches by housekeeping (snacks sweets rose petals) and the service overall was a 10. The cocktails on the roof were a highlight daily as the sunsets from the roof were beautiful. The staff from the roof restaurant spa housekeeping and front desk were all so welcoming and attentive. The bellmen were also so lovely. Always welcoming us with a smile opening doors and leading us to our driver who wasn't necessarily parked right out front.

La Sultana Marrakech,Lori Bert wrote a review Nov 2022,30,Needs improvement,Spent a week here and did enjoy the hotel but the swimming pool is on the ground floor and mostly in the shade the area also doubles up as a dining area for breakfast and dinner .    The large roof terrace is lovely to sunbathe on but there’s only a tiny plunge pool so not possible to have a swim in  which we sorely missed as it was often over 30 degrees.    Also this hotel is located inside the Kasbah area which is very crowded noisy and in the heart of a local market. Whilst you hear very little noise inside the hotel it’s full on the minute you step out of the entrance.    Service whilst charming is erratic and needs real improvement. Same for the food sometimes great and then more often very mediocre. To be honest the staff are well meaning but the management really does lack direction and training and this can only be down to the owners.    There is stiff competition in Marrakech with so many great places to stay and unfortunately this one doesn’t quite meet the mark .,Date of stay: November 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/604lorraines

La Sultana Marrakech,Rosilyn H wrote a review Nov 2022,50,A magical Riad in the Medina,An authentic experience in the ancient Medina in Marrakesh is what attracted me to this property. The description and the pics didn’t do La Saltana Justice. The properly is beautiful and magical!    The friendly and warm welcome by the staff the personal visit from the concierge and the extraordinary efforts the restaurant staff exhibited every day toward our family made us feel like we were among relatives and friends. Every staff member we encountered greeted us with a smile and warm greeting.    My son celebrated a birthday during our stay. Without us even mentioning it they went above and beyond to arrange a special Moroccan baked cake and surprised him at lunch seating.    I enjoyed every square meter of this property. There are so many special places to retreat on property to include the spa the rooftop and the pool just to name a few.

La Sultana Marrakech,Emsie1967 wrote a review Oct 2022,50,Quite breathtaking!,We arrived in Marrakech and it was raining. It rained all day and was still raining when we arrived by taxi from our hotel the Four Seasons. A quick toot on the car horn and this chap appeared as if out of nowhere umbrella in hand and escorted us down this dark alley to a red door at the end. After passing through I must admit a quite ordinary reception area our breaths were taken away by the sheer beauty of the place.

The restaurant downstairs has great Moroccan cuisine; the spa (and small swimming pool) is great - had some massages and hamamm. At night the large rooftop terrace (a football field in size) was cooled by the wind and we had cocktails / champagne whilst listening to the sounds around us (respectful of the mosques calling for prayer).    Staff are really generous with their advice and help. The hotel is well located and even in the heat we were able to get around.    We also went to another hotel on the trip.

La Sultana Marrakech,Paris Traveller wrote a review Jul 2022,50,Ultimate luxury,Ultimate comfort and luxury in this gem of a hotel/Ryad. Small enough to receive truly personalised service from an engaged and happy staff but large enough to benefit from all amenities you would expect. A particular note relating to the food - it is truly exceptional. Simple delicious varied we were not expecting this standard of cooking. Finally the staff (many of whom have been at the hotel for over a decade) are uniformly engaged professional attentive and warm. We loved our stay and in particular the fact that you receive premium service in a beautiful environment without the standardised approach of the large ultra luxury chains.

La Sultana Marrakech,Yaccova wrote a review Jul 2022,50,Beautiful Riad with Attentive Staff,This stunning luxury Riad was located close to the Medina. The Riad is magical and pristine. The fine details are everywhere. Take your breath away beautiful. I found the entire staff to be warm friendly and extremely professional and attentive. Our room on the first floor was spacious and well decorated. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The bathroom area was large and the robe was wonderful. Water and a lot of delicious cookies and fruit were complementary in the room. I was taken aback that they charge a nominal fee for coffee capsules in the room however I am guessing they take it off the bill if one complains. I was also surprised that breakfast was not included as every other luxury place that we stayed in during our 14 day trip had breakfast included. It was also very expensive for breakfast. I realized after that they did advertise that breakfast was not included however I am mentioning it so that other travelers take this into consideration. Breakfast was delicious and plentiful but so breakfast at every Riad we stayed at in Morocco. We ate dinner one night at the Riad. It was delicious but also extremely expensive-like NYC fine dining restaurant expensive. The pool was gorgeous and located in the center of the Riad. It was not small but not huge either. Unfortunately there were not a sufficient amount of lounge chairs and loung seating by the pool. That being said we enjoyed the pool each day and again the helpful staff made things perfect. We really enjoyed the hamam and the massage at the Riad. Both were teriffic! The staff at the spa are also great.,Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yaccova

We did camel riding quad biking went to Azar restaurant went to the mountains etc. but this experience topped the lot.    We only visited the restaurant (not the hotel itself) and it was hands down the best restaurant my partner and I have ever been to.    I booked a private dinner on the rooftop as I wanted to surprise my then girlfriend with a proposal so I emailed the restaurant and they were super helpful. I was liaising with a fabulous man named Anas the whole time and he was so patient and kind. I was even fortunate enough to meet him at the end of the day. He booked a private area for me on the day and even allowed the external photographer to come and visit beforehand so she would know where she can hide to take pictures for the big moment.    The food was frighteningly good yet somehow the service was even better. Hamza served us all night and was just so professional and welcoming. Both him and Anas I can sing their praises enough. Together they made the night the best night of mine and most importantly my fiancés life.

Take a little boat across hike 15 minutes and you are at the ocean with deserted beaches. It is a beautiful paradise.    I booked two nights but the moment I arrived I added a night.

It was a big birthday celebration and we traveled with old friends which made the trip even more special.  From the moment of booking the preparations begin. From booking special birthday dinners at hard to get into restaurants to day excursions… down to special pillows and unique mini bar requirements; the staff at La Sultana could not have been more helpful!  From the moment we arrived the attention to detail was always apparent. With suite upgrades and delicious treats in our rooms.    The first day lunch at the hotels restaurant La Table du Souk did not disappoint… it was the start of what ended up being a fabulous holiday!    If your looking for brilliantly located a small but not to small hotel with bags of facilities you won’t go far wrong at La Sultana. With a spa multiple pools a mega cool bar with awesome music down to 3 options for food… frankly you don’t really ever need to leave the Riad! That’s certainly not to suggest you shouldn’t; Marrakesh is an amazing place! 3 and a bit hrs from home you find another world. Go and explore it and the hotel will help you make that easy.

La Sultana Marrakech,GlobalNomad68 wrote a review Oct 2021,50,A luxury oasis in midst of the bustle,"I can strongly recommend this hotel even to the pickiest of travelers (like me). A beautifully decorated small five-star hotel (smallest in Morocco I believe) with only 28 rooms created by combining five separate riads (courtyard houses) into one. Each room is individually decorated according to the theme of an African animal. As is common with Riad hotels most rooms have little light from the outside and only get their light from the courtyard. Toiletries are from Clarins and are of high quality. The hotel also provides anti-viral disinfectants and custom facemasks in the room during Covid. The rooms have Nespresso machines with cartridges refilled when needed as well as complimentary traditional sweets and nuts.    My room was facing the main courtyard (Giraffe room) with the pool and restaurant. Each evening I enjoyed a sundowner on my balcony while listening to the local ""troubadour"" playing a Gimbri (?) and only interrupted by evening prayers.    The service in the hotel is impeccable. At check in you get assigned your personal concierge with Whatsapp number. You can then text any needs or questions to him/her. In my case I was assigned Abdellah who promptly reacted to everyone of my requests and also provided excellent guidance to the city and restaurants. He did a phenomenal job (as did his colleagues across the hotel).    The spa is small but functional with sauna hammam massages. Pool is too small to swim in it's more for chilling your feet. The massage was priced as it would be in any 5-star hotel in a major European city...but was excellent (compliments to Jamal for one of the best massages ever).    The rooftop is an excellent area to relax and has a well-equipped bar. Bartender Najib makes an excellent Negroni. The rooftop is also good for catching some sun but unfortunately doesn't have any showers in which to wash off some of the sweat/clean up.    Breakfast in the courtyard is worth experiencing. The breakfast is served in a serene and calm courtyard by the pool. It's reasonably (flat) priced and one can pick freely from an a la carte menu of western and Moroccan dishes. Service is very attentive and they are happy to customize any wishes.    Unfortunately I was disappointed with the food at the hotel. Both the rooftop menu and the main restaurant menu were short and the meals I was served were substandard for a hotel of this category and price (in one instance I had to send the meal back to the kitchen). Expected better. With so many excellent restaurants within walking distance (or short taxi ride) it's worth exploring elsewhere.    Tip: for first time travelers don't pay more than 100 Dirhams to/from airport. That's the generally accepted fee. The hotel provides private transport for 450 Dirhams each way.    In short I will definitely be back and enjoyed my stay very much !",Date of stay: October 2021,,"Zurich, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobalNomad68
La Sultana Marrakech,Danielle C wrote a review Oct 2021,50,Beautiful Resort in the Middle of the Medina,La Sultana Marrakech was the most beautiful hotel I have ever been to. I loved how authentic to Morocco the Riads were and all of the detailing was unique and beautiful. Our room was absolutely spectacular and had all of the intricate details you would find throughout the city. The service was excellent and the staff went above and beyond.

La Sultana Marrakech,Justin Huff wrote a review Jul 2021,50,Sublime Boutique Luxury in the Heart of Marrakech,The staff at La Sultana are to be commended. Not only is the property stunning from an architectural and interior design perspective but the staff goes above and beyond expectations. Their efforts and genuine gentle presence were superb. Additionally the food was to die for especially on the rooftop terrace at twilights overlooking the Koutoubia Mosque.    I would recommend this property for couples and families alike. Some of the separate riads can be combined on a fully-exclusive private basis which is perfect for multigenerational families or a group of friends.    The location is unbeatable! Just steps away from the Djmaa El Fnaa Square and some of the most sought-after shops in the iconic souqs of Marrakech La Sultana offers convenience as well as phenomenal accommodation experience.    10/10 recommend!,Date of stay: June 2021,,"Benicia, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swaggyswan

The lobby was a peaceful garden where we were greeted with tea and cookies.  Our room was gorgeous - the bed was comfortable and room was quiet. We had a small terrace overlooking the pool/dining area where there was a gentleman who played the Oud nightly.  The spa services were lovely. We indulged in a hammam treatment as well as a massage and enjoyed both.  The rooftop lounge was a great modern addition to the hotel.

La Sultana Marrakech,Moli Y wrote a review Mar 2020,50,Absolutely gorgeous luxury riad experience with amazing service!!!,My husband and I booked this for 3 nights as part of our 11-day honeymoon trip to Morocco. This was the last portion of our trip but even if we hadn't been exhausted and ready for pampering we would have absolutely loved this place. It's gorgeous - every turn led to another courtyard or pool or lounging area that was decked out in colorful tiles tropical plants and stunning views. It's made up of separate riads all connected together and each had their own unique but beautiful decor. The rooftop deck had amazing views of the Kotoubia mosque and the Saadian tombs in addition to a pool lots of lounging space dining space and a really nice kitchen for cooking classes that we were very sad to have missed. The service is exceptional - they decorated our room and gave us champagne since it was our honeymoon and the concierge was sincerely excited to show us the room. They anticipated our every need and gave great recommendations on where to visit how to not get scammed and save money. When you check in they give you a list of daily hotel-sponsored activities which included everything from a group run through the medina to happy hour at a rooftop bar. Dinner by the larger pool was accompanied by live music beautiful view and was very very delicious. As opposed to some of the other (also luxury) riads we stayed at it truly felt like we had all the amenities we would in a luxury hotel in the US. With some of the other riads it was helpful to read other reviews about which rooms were best but I agree with many of the posts here about La Sultana - I'm sure there is no room that isn't exceptional. We were in the leopard room which was enormous with sitting space a desk a bathroom separated by an ornate door with a giant closet tub shower etc. We also had a hammam and massage which were absolutely amazing - highly recommend.

The ambiance of the rooftop is simply romantic and suitable for intimate family dinners.

La Sultana Marrakech,rehabib wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Just beautiful,This is such a gorgeous space. I mean who doesn’t love a beautiful aesthetic. The detail in every corner of this place is breathtaking. The hotel is a former wealthy family’s residence so made up of adjoining riads. 3 of them I think each with a different look and feel. A heated indoor pool can be used heat round. There is a small gym which I was excited about as it’s been difficult to work out while in the country. I enjoyed the breakfast and had dinner here one evening which was lovely. Lunch was a different story. I was seated then 15min later I had to flag someone down for a menu. Lunch options read like a dinner menu so I decided to leave to find a lighter meal.      The service here is wonderful. Such a great team who are all so friendly and helpful. I loved my room 127 with a king bed a seating area and the bathroom was so unique. The detailed carved ceiling & chandelier were stunning. Just a note like all riads in the country inside noise is an issue. You can hear what’s happening in the courtyard from inside your room so just be prepared as you won’t escape it as it’s just how they are built. The hotel is located about a 10min walk from the souks of the Médina which I preferred for a touch of serenity.  The Sultana is in my top 3 places I’ve stayed in the country. Loved it!,Date of stay: December 2019,Trip type: Traveled solo,Worldwide,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rehabib
La Sultana Marrakech,pedantlondon wrote a review Dec 2019,10,"Disappointing, very rough round the edges",We had great expectations but the hotel disappointed in the most obvious and predictable ways: WiFi not working; being logged off every time we closed a browser; smoke and smell from the street made the roof top experience unpleasant; the hotel felt just like in many other places in Marrakech where the staff just want your money. The pool was a major issue. It is only decorative and looks good on photos. It is arranged in a way that does not encourage guests to use it it has freezing water not heated which for 500 usd + per night is an issue. You basically end up in a hotel without being able to dip in a pool. We stayed at similar category hotels such as Fasano in Rio which all have a usable and heated pool! The decor is fading and the hotel needs a serious face lift. See photos of two broken door handles in our room. The check out was the most traumatic with a horde of staff being rushed to our room to check it. Not sure if this we to check if we had a drink from the mini bar (non drinkers here!) or if the door handles were still broken....but it was embarrassing!,Date of stay: October 2019,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pedantlondon

We loved all of our food; exquisite! Get the filet of beef trust me. Our service was also excellent. Our server Hamza was so attentive polite and had great recommendations for food and wine.

La Sultana Marrakech,BLBNYC wrote a review Nov 2019,50,a perfect stay in Marrakech at La Sultana,Spent three night and wished it was more. The hotel was beautiful and immaculately clean. It is about a ten minute walk to the most busy part of the city but there is plenty to do see eat and BUY at your front door. From the landscaping to the pool to the rooftop everything was clearly designed with care. As an interior design fan I took a lot of pictures! We took advantage of dining by the indoor pool the rooftop for food/drinks and the spa amenities including massages We walked everywhere in the city from La Sultana and never found anything too far.  We stayed in the Autruche (or Ostrich suite) and it was perfect - beautiful pink walls comfy bed gorgeous bath. The hotel has lovely little sitting areas to relax after a long hectic day both inside and on the rooftop. The spa was clean and smelled amazing and my massage was just what I needed to relax. The food was great breakfast was tasty and the dinners were fantastic all using fresh and local ingredients.  I could go on and on about the decor and such but what this place is really about is the people. I have yet to find a more gracious and happy to help staff. The entire team always met us with a smile and a conversation. A special thank you to Mohammed the waiter on the rooftop. His service was impeccable and he was so warm and friendly to us answering all of our silly tourist questions remembering what we like to drink teaching us Arabic phrases etc. He made our three days even more special!  All in all La Sultana gets a perfect score from me. I did not want to leave at check out. Book here and you will not be disappointed. I hope to return one day.,Date of stay: November 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BLBNYC

The roof terrace is a really lovely spot to sit and have a drink read a book or just daydream.

La Sultana Marrakech,kyle10014 wrote a review Nov 2019,50,An urban oasis fit for a sultan and ideally located,"A truly once-in-a-lifetime type of property. Just a 10 minute walk from the medina markets and nestled in a kasbah district of its own next to the Saadian tombs you enter this hotel off a busy street full of shops vendors pushcarts donkeys locals tourists...you name it. Taxis can pull up to within 20 feet of the entrance so arriving with luggage is easy. Despite the bustle of the colorful street scene as you step into the courtyard of the hotel off the street the sound instantly retreats and what is essentially a palace reveals itself.    Every inch of this hotel is photo-worthy. Gorgeous tiles carvings art are everywhere. The rooms are arranged around a series of different courtyards with each one having its own unique design. The rooftop is spectacular for gazing over the parapet at the street below sipping a cocktail in the afternoon sun or sunbathing if some relaxation time is in order.    The staff is top-drawer from the moment you enter. Friendly accommodating charming beyond measure they represent the very best of hospitality. Their recommendations for us were spot on each time and they provided outstanding advice about sites directions etc. Similarly housekeeping was outstanding in every way twice a day. The restaurant is pleasant and beautiful in a covered courtyard with tables surrounding a pool. Food is well prepared if not especially memorable although the lamb tagine was a standout. Breakfast buffet with its attendant ""a la carte"" menu you could also order from was quite good.    The room had every amenity imaginable plus offerings for things like locally produced bath products if you prefer them over the Clarins (which were also great) and a long list of items you could simply request if needed from extra toothbrushes to other toiletries you may have run out of or forgotten. The edible welcome treats were very appreciated. All was immaculately maintained.    We looked at the Royal Mansour and the Mamounia and honestly we were very happy we chose La Sultana. It is smaller and more intimate than the other two which are huge compounds. The other two are also on a non-descript huge boulevard removed from the vibrance of the Sultana's street setting. For some seeking a hotel with gardens grounds and more of a resort feel these other two may be excellent choices--how could you really go wrong at this level of luxury right? But for us La Sultana was exactly what we imagined when we envisioned a trip to Marrakech--a palace nestled off the inner city streets. And the walk to the medina from La Sultana--whether via the larger main streets or by the side streets (which you will learn your way around soon enough if staying for 2-3 days!) is like an immersion in the local urban street life that would be missing to an extent if staying at the other two properties given their relative locations.",Date of stay: October 2019,,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kyle10014

All of the staff including our butler Ahmad were so friendly and helpful. Ahmad arranged for a guide to take us on a 3 hours walking tour of the Medina which was a super experience.

We had a drink at La Mamounia and while it was nice it felt like a large soul-less hotel compared to La Sultana which is boutique luxury and gives you the feeling of staying in a traditional riad. Also from La Mamounia you have to taxi everywhere whereas from La Sultana we walked to all the sights in the Medina. The staff was excellent and accommodating.

La Sultana Marrakech,Jane B wrote a review Jul 2019,50,"Perfect, luxury Riad in every way",I write this as I sadly drive away from La Sultana. Honestly there are no perfect words to describe the Riad because from booking to leaving at 5am it was magical. I researched many riads and hotels in the Médina and surrounding areas but other reviewers pictures and words made me chose wisely. When I say they go above and beyond they truly do. Yes this Riad is one of the most expensive in Marrakech but worth every penny and more. It is low season so they upgraded us from the a suite to the Jaguar suite- stunning! You will be assigned a concierge and given a cell phone to keep in touch (thank you Anas!). They handled almost every aspect of our 4 nights and I felt trusting of the vendors they set us up with- from service to excursions. Every employee of the hotel is there to serve you to the highest extent without feeling up tight or snobbish. You will always have a relaxed feeling while on the grounds even though you’re steps away from the hustle and bustle. And the Riad itself is breathtaking in every way! It’s in a good neighborhood of the Médina and walking distance to many highlights. If you want a large style hotel with amazing service La Mamounia was beautiful as well. We had drinks there one night and would go back but you have more of a grand scale Royal feeling versus quaint and laid back luxury if La Sultana.    Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!

This is hands down the most beautiful hotel I’ve stayed in. There have been some that came close (a recent trip to Cartagena put Hotel Casa San Agustin close to a tie) but none that surpassed it. I should note that on our trip to Marrakech we stayed at both La Sultana and La Mamounia and while the latter was certainly gorgeous La Sultana was a way more intimate less commercial kind of beauty. I did not want to leave. The riads are stunningly beautiful and each courtyard is a delight. The staff is always ready to help. The rooms (we stayed in the elephant suite) are gorgeous and smell divine. The location makes it a perfect oasis within the old city. Stay here - you won’t regret it.

The property has great character and everyone employed there seems well versed in the art of hospitality - the very opposite of one might find in a chain hotel experience. The feel of the environment is a respite from the busy Medina. We dined at both the upstairs restaurant for lunch and downstairs poolside for breakfast and dinners. Highly recommend at least dining once with them for dinner good live music a great menu and Abbas will see that you're taken great care of.

La Sultana Marrakech,Patrick P wrote a review Jul 2019,50,La Sultana in swing...,There are hotel experiences that stays with you ones that you easily remember. For me stayong at La Sultana was one of those times.  I stayed there 17th to 19th of June and loved every minute. One moment you're on the bustling main street the next you're in opulence and tranquility. It's my first time in Morocco also on the African continent.    Even with 28 suites and at full occupancy there's the constant feeling that you're sharing the Riad with only a few more individual.  The always ready to assist staff manage to stay just out of the way but seem to read your mind and turn up when you need assistance.  The place is quiet relaxing cool and is everything you're likely to want from a hotel.  I'm already making plans for my next visit.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Greater London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Patrickson65
La Sultana Marrakech,Blair Senesi wrote a review Jul 2019,50,Stunning 5-Star Riad,Our experience at La Sultana exceeded our wildest expectations and I highly recommend staying here if you want the very best of a five star resort with the authenticity of staying in a exclusive luxurious riad within the medina along with the best concierge who can handle everything from airport taxis to tour guides to reservations.    Property: The property is absolutely beautiful no detail is missed from the intricate tile to the stunning chandeliers. Our prestige room was private quiet and had plenty of space a comfortable king size bed and a gorgeous bathroom. There are two pools the main one is surrounded by pillars and its heated so you never want to get out (I sure didn't!). The second one is on the roof where you can sunbathe and enjoy the views. La Sultana is walking distance to Jemaa el-fnaa which is wonderful but it is also so peaceful you feel like you're miles away which is so a pleasure to come home to after being out and about.    Dining: We ate breakfast everyday by the pool which had a good variety and delicious pastries. Lunch and cocktails on the rooftop were a highlight. We felt like we were in paradise peering over the medina and watching the sunset. Dinner was fabulous as well with excellent service and a romantic setting by the pool with a live musician. The service quality and taste of the food matched up to the best we had in all of Marrakesh.    Service: We were so happy with the service we received at La Sultana. The hotel arranged a tour guide for us to take us around the medina managed our dinner reservations for us and even booked us a day trip into the Agafay desert for a VIP camel ride and private lunch in a tent overlooking the desert. They went above and beyond taking care of ironing my dress and my husband's suit for the wedding we were attending.    Spa: The spa is wonderful with a stunning photo worthy pool. We did a hammam and massage and both were exceptional.    I would highly recommend staying here and we can't wait to come back!,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Tiburon, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blairsenesi

The hotel is a small collection of Riads combined into one seamless hotel experience. Staff were friendly and helpful throughout our stay. Nice secluded heated courtyard pool including a couple of small spa pools in other locations including the rooftop terrace. Rooms were individual and well appointed with all typical amenities including a bath. The hotels secluded entry and Riad design made a welcome sanctuary when returning from the day’s activities. Well catered buffet breakfast with an excellent range of local foods plus some western offerings. Particularly nice Berber omelettes. Also enjoyed a dinner with a nice selection of Moroccan and International dishes across the menu. The traditional harira soup a highlight but we also ate some great tagines.

Then you are escorted to your room in one of the 4 riads that constitute the hotel. Over time you will get used to navigating your way to the terrace at dusk poolside for breakfast and dinner. Marrakech seems very chaotic once you leave the carpeted entrance but the delightful staff do everything they can to make the stay enjoyable.

But the median==na is also a living place with alleys leading to homes. One day we wandered down a lane to a school and watched moms and grandmothers pick up their children.  But inside the hotel all is calm. The owners have done a wonderful job of combining several Riads and yet each retains its original flavor. Each has its own courtyard. Be sure to ask for a tour! Our room had a deck looking out to a reflecting pool. -- the perfect place to recharge.  Meals are delicious. Besides breakfasts (anything you could desire) we had two dinners there. Try the Tangia!

La Sultana Marrakech,LisaB2D2 wrote a review Apr 2019,50,We'll Be Back! A Slice of Heaven.,"We spent 5 nights at La Sultana and will surely return. The hotel is beautiful -- a series of Riads joined together. The rooms are large and simply gorgeous. Every attention to detail is there. You'll find pitted dates stuffed with walnuts in your room every day. When you check in you are greeted with Moroccan mint tea and a delicious traditional Moroccan pastry that translates in English to ""gazelles legs"". The customer service is exceptional. No request is too small and is taken care of immediately. I wanted a henna tattoo at a particular place they tried for hours but were getting no answer so they booked me at a comparable place. They could've given up but they got me a henna tattoo. Special commendations go to Anas at Reception and Abbas in the Restaurant. They both made us and our 10 year old son feel very special -- like VIPs!  I should add that while we received great recommendations from the staff about restaurants outside of the hotel the hotel restaurant should be considered a destination restaurant. It's pricier than some other places but worth it. In fact we cancelled booked reservations for other places in the Medina just so we could eat at the hotel. We took advantage of their cooking class and made a incredible tagine and salad with the help of the restaurant's head chef who has been there for almost 20 years. While you are in the heart of the city La Sultana is a sublime oasis. You never want to leave but you probably should do some sightseeing. They scheduled a wonderful trip where we rode quad bikes in the Agafay Desert a private tour guide for our first day in the city they'll tell you what to pay for a taxi so you don't get ripped off (no more than 50-60 MAD) and booked spa treatments for us in their beautiful spa. The 4 Hand Massage was amazing. All in all it's one of the best hotel experiences we've ever had.

La Sultana Marrakech,Rupert Sheldon wrote a review Apr 2019,50,Rooftop chilling in Marrakech,La Sultana is wonderful place to stay brimming with authentic moroccan charm. Occupying an extremely convenient but discrete location in the middle of the old town and next to the Kasbah the hotel provides a quiet and luxurious sanctuary away from the noise colour and bustle of downtown Marrakech.    Made up of five interconnecting Riads La Sultana offers the last word in understated elegance but best of all is the wonderful and very personalised 'nothings too much trouble' service led by Rashid and his team on the front desk which proved to be the icing on the cake during our stay.    Marrakech is a wonderful place to visit at the end of March. Most importantly the weather was more than warm enough to make full use of the fantastic rooftop terrace which proved to be a real highlight with lots of unexpected pleasures including a quiet and secluded sun lounger area with plunge pool and numerous discrete and shaded spots to chill out. To cap it all the roof top restaurant is an absolute gem with first rate food and a relaxing vibe - the perfect place to lose a few sun filled hours in the middle of the day whilst enjoying the local rose gris!  All in all La Sultana provided the perfect tonic at the end of a British winter - a very special place to stay. We spent four nights there and really couldn't find fault in anything; quite the opposite in fact. We returned home with batteries fully re-charged and counting down the days to our next trip to Marrakech for a little more rooftop chilling!,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RupertSheldon
La Sultana Marrakech,insearchofsolitude67 wrote a review Mar 2019,50,SIMPLY STUNNING,La Sultana Marrakech is simply stunning. It is located just inside the Kasbah when our driver pulled up I thought we had made a big mistake with our choice. The hotel entrance is up an alleyway. We were greeted at our taxi by the doorman and taken into the hotel reception - calmness enveloped us immediately. We were taken straight up to the roof terrace and given chilled nut milk and a date followed by mint tea. The roof terrace was an explosion of flowers pretty bird song and tranquility yet look over the edge to the chaos and madness below it is quite unbelievable. On one side stands the majestic snow capped Atlas Mountains and on the other the mosque stands proud in the near distance in between a proud pair of storks are raising their chicks in a huge nest perched precariously on a ledge.    We had lunch on the roof terrace which was fresh and colourful and the staff were attentive and efficient.    After lunch we were shown to our room which was enclosed in a small courtyard. It was a good size with large comfy bed and everything else you would expect from such a sublime hotel.    Supper was relaxing set out around the pool with local music and the food was again fantastic and the portions are huge. Breakfast is also served around the pool with a small fresh buffet and eggs ordered from your table the Berber omelette is fantastic and very different.    La Sultana is magnificent consisting of five Riads it is huge. The art furnishings and architecture are simply stunning I would never tire of walking around this place it is a feast for your eyes and your soul.    We left for La Sultana Ouilidia for 4 nights before returning to the madness of Marrakech for one last night where we were rewarded by an upgrade to a beautiful room on the first floor which had windows into the courtyard. Windows to the outside are one thing that we miss in a Riad so this was a special treat.    I do not apolgise for using so many adjectives to describe this place but it really it stunning amazing beautiful fantastic sublime. Avoid the big hotels this is the jewel in Marrakech.    Finally I must praise each and every member of staff front desk managers waiters housekeepers doormen - they were all highly trained well presented and above all genuinely welcoming and friendly. They could not do enough to make you feel special without being disingenuous.

La Sultana Marrakech,Jennifer C wrote a review Feb 2019,50,Lovely hotel and great location near the souks,This is not one of the grand hotels outside the medina but if you want to stay in/near the medina and its souks it is a gorgeous hotel with all kinds of interesting nooks and crannies each room is uniquely decorated with a subtle animal theme and the public spaces are what you likely think of when you think of sumptuous Moroccan-themed luxury.    The location is perfect it is on a paved road so taxis can take you right to the entryway but is right next to the tombs five minutes from the palace and a quick 15 minute walk to the main square by which you enter the souks.    Rooms were lovely again this is an old riad so it's not ultra modern I had some issues with my AC which were promptly dealt with. I appreciated the Clarins toiletries. Loved that they had adapters for US electronics already in some of the outlets.    Service is amazing they will help you with anything.    We didn't eat any meals except breakfast which was good but would have been better if included in the rate.    Never took more than a few second to secure taxis.    They can also arrange airport transfers for 480dm and a guide for a day for 800dm which I highly recommend to get oriented.    I couldn't get the elevator working but I am sure there was something I needed to push that I didn't know. Took me a day or two to be able to find my room through the winding hallways which was kind of cool actually.

Bottle of wine to room was > £45 which is obviously ridiculous.    Breakfast ...obvs not included. Overall not for me.

La Sultana Marrakech,Wheresnik wrote a review Jan 2019,50,"""One Thousand and One Night experience""","La Sultana is probably one of the most iconic hotels of Marrakech. What's unique about this hotel is that it is a collection of five original different and elegantly decorated riads just in the real heart of the Kasbah...only a few meters from the royal palaces museums and Jemaa el Fna square. The calm atmosphere and all the different tastefully decorated settings are the perfect backgrounds for some epic pictures. The rooftop bar (open also to non-guests) is an amazing spot to catch the sunset and relax after a day spent wandering around the souks. My room was in the mosaic decorated Riad Bahia a very intimate part of the hotel. This is the Riad with the deluxe prestige suites. My guest suite was actually a very large room called ""autruche” (ostrich) (all rooms are named after African birds and animals). During my stay (Januray/winter season) breakfast and dinner were served in the Riad Almohade. This is the largest courtyards where a tropical garden and the swimming pool are also located. Unfortunately the pool is open for guest only after breakfast.  A special thanks and mention must go to the Spa: I had a fantastic relaxing massage and a body scrubs. In addition the pool and relaxation area offer a real “Arabian Nights” atmosphere. La Sultana is definitely a magical place where you can find a restful spot to unwind away from the noise and bustle of the city of Marrakech.",Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Milan, Italy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wheresnik
La Sultana Marrakech,Kamluca wrote a review Jan 2019,50,"“First Class, Indeed:",An utterly marvellous and gracious property. It has style character and finesse worthy of praise. Despite being in the middle of town inside the hotel was a haven of peace and tranquillity.    The decor and style is authentic and the personal service received by each staff member was very professional yet friendly and courteous. The attentiveness and attention to detail was much appreciated.    We had the pleasure of being guided with suggestions by the Head Concierge - Clefs d’or Saida.    She was quick to understand your “taste”and made suitable recommendations ie restaurants tours etc. All of which was 100% perfect.    This is a property we will definitely return to and HIGHLY recommend!

La Sultana Marrakech,Jemmie wrote a review Jan 2019,50,Absolutely Amazing,My time at La Sultana was wonderful. The exceptional service given to my sister and I by Hassan at La Sultana was unbelievable. Not only did he escort us to our riad gave us an exceptional tour of the hotel/rooftop but also called a taxi that went into the Médina to pick us up after dinner to bring us back to the hotel. The level of dedication and attention Hassan put into our stay at La Sultana was something I had never witnessed before. Five star customer service at La Sultana.    The pool and hammam at La Sultana are also gorgeous and you can see the Atlas Mountains as well as the Saadian tombs. Would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a 5 star riad experience and close proximity to Fna and the Médina.,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jemmiet2019

Rooftop of the hotel was my favourite place for drink or just for relax on the sun.

La Sultana was recommended by a co-worker of hers and It was a great choice! Great service at the hotel a special shout out to ANES at reception. He was super helpful and always had a smile on his face! We stayed in the “giraffe room” all of the rooms are named after animals. It was so charming and comfortable. Daily breakfast was delicious and the service was superb. I highly recommend the Hammam and massages at the hotel. It was a wonderful experience. We went to a hammam in town for massages only. The massages were very goodbut the experience did not compare to our experience at la sultana.  It think it is a must even though it is pricier than a hammam in town. **Les Bains de Marrakech Morocco is supposed to be amazing. Plan in advance- we could not get in.

We came for our honeymoon and are already making plans to come back. We were greeted with some almond milk and the most delicious stuffed dates. The upstairs bar is great with views of the Atlas Mountains. We were able to walk anywhere we wanted from the hotel which we loved. We did a hammam and massage at the spa and it was great. I get massages often and was worried it would not be deep enough for me but it was perfect. The hammam was a good experience made even better by the fact that my husband and I were able to enjoy it together.

We have stayed in fine hotels in many places and the visual delights the quality of the staff the large and elegant rooms and the outstanding food made this the best ever. We stayed in the 'Ibis' room but the other 3 couples in our group had similar rooms. We breakfasted in the hotel each morning from Oct. 13 to 17 and the food is superb. One night we had dinner on the roof-top restaurant and it was similarly perfect. It is an easy walk to the souk and you can do it by yourself and not get lost! We went through the more famous and expensive hotel La Mamounia and it was positively shabby by comparison. In La Sultana everyplace you turn is a beautiful example of Moorish architecture.

La Sultana Marrakech,djparis2017 wrote a review Dec 2018,50,Magical Marrakech,MAGICAL MARRAKESH  From the moment I set foot onto the candlelit path that leads to Hotel La Sultana I was swept away by its beauty and the excitement of what lay ahead — the rustic setting outstanding service graciousness and warmth of the talented and efficient team who greeted me as I entered the hotel made me feel immediately welcome and delighted about my first weekend in Morocco.    Upon arrival I was led to the gorgeous music-filled rooftop terrace to begin the check-in process where I was served almond milk fragrant mint tea sweet dates with almonds and a warm wet towel to refresh myself and ease into my weekend.    From the rooftop I got a better sense for the location of the hotel and the liveliness of the Kasbah a traditional district of Marrakesh located within historic Old Town Medina full of authentic markets bustling street life and local flavor. The Kasbah is a short walk or taxi ride to the crowded and vibrant Jemma El-fna square considered an important symbol of Marrakesh.    This historic hotel features several connecting ancient riads (traditional Morrocan palaces and homes each with its own open-air courtyard full of lush plants and enchanting water features). Guests are free to discover a labyrinth of handsomely decorated seating areas romantic-looking nooks rose-filled fountains and terraces through small doorways meandering staircases and connecting rooftop decks that lead to unexpected beauty everywhere.    When I walked into my room there were delicious local pastries a large bottle of water and fresh fruit waiting for me. Such a hospitable way to begin my stay.    As part of my research prior to arriving I’d read that the hotel had a top-ranked spa—and it really was deliriously good. I booked a deep tissue massage with Jamal one of their warm and skilled massage therapists and it surpassed my expectations. The serene beauty and calm of the spa transported me to a magical place.    The colors scents and flavors of Marrakesh are intoxicating—one visit and it has stolen my heart.    The soulfulness of my experience at La Sultana coupled with the attentive service hospitality and sheer kindness of front desk manager Saida and the entire top-notch team made my experience a unique and memorable one.

La Sultana Marrakech,sarah201072 wrote a review Nov 2018,50,5 stars isn't enough!!!!,What an absolutely amazing hotel - one of the best if not THE best that we've ever stayed in. It is literally an oasis of calm in the middle of the Medina and it's location gives you the best of both worlds - you're perfectly located for exploring the slightly chaotic streets of Marrakech but with the option of retreating to the peace and serenity of the hotel at any time. It was our first visit to Marrakech and we wanted to immerse ourselves in it's culture so we booked a traditional hammam at the spa which was wonderfully cleansing (although be prepared to get naked!!). We also asked the hotel to arrange a local guide to show us around - I would thoroughly recommend this. Our guide was called Ali and he spent around 4.5 hours with us giving us an insight into the city and guiding us through the Souks and the main square. Without exception the staff at the hotel were brilliant (we'd had fabulous service from the concierge before we even arrived) - they made us feel welcome and special from the moment we walked through the door and nothing was too much trouble. The room was exquisite - very traditional with the most amazing bathroom in the world. We had breakfast in the hotel on both mornings and dinner once - the food was wonderful - traditional Moroccan dishes in a perfect setting. We also enjoyed cocktails on the roof terrace overlooking the hustle and bustle of the market below and with the Atlas Mountains looking beautiful in the far distance. We found this hotel by chance (largely thanks to Trip Advisor) but I cannot recommend it enough!

La Sultana Marrakech,Thomas H wrote a review Nov 2018,50,"Peace, Comfort and Beauty Just Steps from the Busy Streets of Marrakesh",The streets of old Marrakesh can be dangerously chaotic but just a short walk down a side alley reveals this luxurious hotel.    There are elegant shops within its wall but what makes it truly lovely are the peaceful nooks and crannies in which to relax not to mention the rooms themselves that feel like they are in their own little villas within the hotel.    The restaurant which serves on the main level or on the expansive roof deck (when the weather is amenable) serves deliciously prepared traditional Moroccan fare but also items with a broader international preparation. The chef even put together a salad Nicoise on demand for my wife. Both nights we had dinner there there was also live music played subtly by a lure player. Very nice.    This is to say that the service is exceptional at La Sultana.    They also have an indoor pool which we took advantage of and enjoyed thoroughly.    But back to the roof deck. Not only does it have a full bar but it provides a wonderful view over the rooftops of the area and allows one to hear the call to prayer from multiple mosques in the area... part of the magical Moroccan experience.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S7681SEthomash

As it was November dining at night was around the pool with local music playing and beautifully lit. Lovely food and prices similar to a nice restaurant in the uk.  We also had lunch on the roof terrace overlooking the Saadian Toombs( personally not worth visiting only takes 10 mins to go round and you can see most from the hotel).  The spa is stunning we had a deep tissue massage while there when we arrived so a great way to start a break.

What a stunning serene opulent yet non pretentious retreat! The staff made us feel so welcome and went above and beyond to do so without being intrusive. The bedrooms are truly stunning and each Riad complements one another with unique pieces of art original architecture and a general sense of peace. Luxury in abundance without being over the top and immaculate is an understatement!    Breakfast lunch and dinner were all delicious with plenty of choice and authentic menu options. The spa is a must! We each had a Hammam and massage which was extremely relaxing and a real treat. We took the cookery class and it was the highlight of our week! Good fun and memorable (and tasty too).    La Sultana is situated close to everything without being interrupted by the busy pace of Marrakech.

La Sultana Marrakech,Tara ✨ wrote a review Oct 2018,50,What a Perfect Little Riad in the Heart of the Medina,I could not speak more highly of La Sultana. Having stayed at and visited several riads in Marrakech La Sultana is the most exquisite and opulent of them all. With five unique riads built into one mega palace La Sultana is the perfect place to relax and enjoy fine Moroccan luxury while being in the hustle and bustle of the Medina. I stayed here with friends and we had such a great time hanging out in the riad that we hardly wanted to leave to explore. There are 27 luxurious and unique rooms and several lounging areas that make you feel as if you are a guest at a Moroccan palace.    The Location:  The location couldn't be more perfect. Set on a quiet street steps from the main square in the medina there are many great restaurants around and everything you need just outside the doorstep. I appreciated being on a safe and quieter street and tucked away from the main touristy areas.    The Service;  Being part of the Small Luxury Hotels of the world they are certainly up to par with many major leading luxury hotels. Their service is genuine and impeccable. Everyone from the housekeeping staff to the dining staff to the front doormen were very pleasant and lovely to speak to. I only wish I spoke better French so I could converse with them better and enjoy learning more about life in Morocco. Our room was promptly cleaned each day with delicious fresh dates left on our pillow. Everyone was overly accommodating making you feel as if you were a prestigious guest in their palace. It was a warm and memorable experience.    The Pool:  The pool is immaculate. With only 27 rooms you can always find a spot to hang out in the sun. The pool chairs are always kept up with fresh towels and placed with the most adorable straw hats embroidered with La Sultana. My friends and I figured out the perfect balance of spending time at the riad and exploring Marrakech. We hung out by the pool until 4 pm before venturing into the medina for the evening for sunset and dinner. This ended up being the perfect balance for our stay as we were able to enjoy the amenities of the riad while also exploring the vibrancy of Marrakech.    The Rooms:  They have 27 exotic and unique rooms across their 5 charming riads. We stayed in the tropical courtyard of Riad Sheherazade in a premium suite aptly named 'Le Tigre'. Our room was ultra charming and decked out in African Tiger motif. It was quite large with a king bed seating area closet and expansive restroom. We were very pleased with our room and it was a very comfortable stay. I loved having no windows as we were able to sleep in past 7am for once!    Everything else!  La Sultana was just perfect. On top of everything else they have a perfect rooftop with lovely views over the pink city. The rooftop is home to one of the best restaurant/bars in the city and also has a perfect sunbathing area with plunge pool. In addition to the rooftop they also have an onsite spa. The spa is a traditional Moroccan Hamman with the most incredible plunge pool and lounging space. Last but not least the food at La Sultana is fantastic. The breakfast is plentify and hearty and their menus for lunch and dinner have many options. We opted to eat many meals here as the food was quite delicious.    I couldn't recommend La Sultana more for your stay in Marrakech. I have posted several pictures as well as a tour to my Instagram blog @luxe_tourista. I have also added some more information on my blog at www .luxetourista .com    I hope you choose La Sultana for your stay in Marrakech!,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Toronto, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuxeTourista

We went for my birthday which was also our first time in Marrakech and in Morocco.    We arranged transfer service through the hotel and despite our delayed flight the driver was still waiting in a clean and air conditioned car. We arrived in the square of the Médina - it was alive with social life. The bellman led us into a lantern lined walkway to LaSultana. It’s an oasis of Moroccan design paintings furniture and sculpture as well as craftsmanship.    Our stay was full of lovely memories including sun bathing on the terrace with a plunge pool drinks on the roof terrace at sunset breakfast by the pool and after sightseeing and exploring an afternoon rest in our air conditioned room and comfortable bed.    Saida and Khalid were so helpful in securing taxis reservations and anything we needed. The restaurant team was polite helpful and service throughout the hotel exceeded our expectations. The room was well cleaned towels refreshed sometimes twice a day and the roses were lovely. The food we had was delicious.    It’s an understatement to say that we have never been so well looked after. Saida arranged for extra roses and rose petals in our room on my birthday and she arranged a delicious lunch at a nearby restaurant and a stroll in their gardens. She arranged dinner and a show and her efforts made the day was a magical memory.    Khalid has boundless energy and enthusiasm for his job and his guests. The bellmen were friendly but shrewd and advised us on the correct amount to pay a taxi for excursions.

La Sultana Marrakech,Sylvia K wrote a review Sep 2018,50,The most spectacular lodging that makes the Moroccan experience a dream,I don't know where to begin with La Sultana. I guess from the beginning. We ordered car service as I heard you cab drivers can try to haggle you and we got in late. They promptly were ready to pick my husband and I up. We arrived and we were blown away by how pretty the riad was. I was just in awe. The butler brought our bags in our room and this palace of a suite was just jaw dropping. From their gold plated sinks to their marble floor and walls to the extremely private quarters you're immersed in we were in awe.    Moving onto the actual facility it was a dream. Every turn is a different room with different themes. Husband and I did a mini photoshoot with our camera because we had never seen such architecture. The rooftop is just as picture perfect as downstairs. Their pool is so pretty. The one at their spa is even more beautiful. Both restaurants have great food. It's quite apparent we maximized our stay here. It was to the point that we couldn't imagine Morocco without La Sultana. We dined at the restaurants and pool and we lounged at the rooftop at night with the cool breeze and live Moroccan weather.    The hospitality was phenomenal. Everyone is very polite. Most everyone can speak English French (main language) Spanish and Arabic. It made it very convenient for us. The spa is great as well. We got a massage here and hammam across the street from here. We hope to visit again and will be telling all our friends and family about this place.,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Los Angeles, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sylviasoyoung
La Sultana Marrakech,Mattfester wrote a review Sep 2018,50,A Perfect Night for Cocktails...,We were planning on having dinner here but as it was we just enjoyed the cocktails ( no problems it was just more formal than we were looking for ).  Arrived by taxi to be greeted by a friendly doorman and shown through to the hotel entrance. This is up a quiet walkway on red carpet and light by beautiful Moroccan Lamps  Once inside we took the lift to the roof terrace. WOW. A stunning location with an open roof and views down to the pool area surrounding streets and other areas of the hotel.  Large intimate seating areas at one side and the restaurant to the other.  They had a great array of cocktails and drinks on offer all averagly priced for this style of establishment  I would definetly reccomend this restaurant ( although we didnt eat on this occassion ) but would definetly come back on another visit to this city,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Southampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mattfester

We had the Tigre room - a large quiet and restful haven to retreat to after spending time in the exuberant city. The room was set off an inner courtyard which was cool and peaceful. We enjoyed dinners up on the roof terrace appreciating the cooling wind and amazing specticle of the storks returning to the city to roost for the night. The food was excellent and we really enjoyed getting to know Moroccan food - of the finest quality. Breakfast around the pool was the perfect relaxing start to the day before heading out to explore.

La Sultana Marrakech,Brendan B wrote a review Sep 2018,50,In a city of beautiful hotels this one reigns supreme.,My wife and I stayed here for our honeymoon in August and we both knew well before we checked out that this was probably the best hotel we've ever stayed in.  Upon arrival until check out and even beyond when we needed help with bookings or recommendations the staff at this hotel were nothing but friendly professional and extremely helpful.  A special thank you must go to Ghizlane who upgraded us for our honeymoon to the Jaguar Suite the nicest room we've ever stayed in. It was a perfect introduction to an amazing country and one that we won't ever forget.  We enjoyed the experience so much that we stayed at the hotel again briefly after we'd finished our road trip around Morocco. Upon arriving back into Marrakech we were quickly reminded just how great hotel service can be. At La Sultana we wanted for nothing. It was worth every penny.  The rest of the staff that we encountered were every bit as gracious and helpful.  Anas Hassan and Saida at the front desk with Ghizlane were amazing and only enhanced an already fantastic stay.  There were so many staff at the hotel that we didn't catch the names of but they all made it a truly beautiful stay.  The facilities are stunning; the breakfast pool rooftop terrace differently themed riads and courtyards room service. We sampled it all and could find fault with any of it.  It's in a great location a quick 10-15 minute walk to Jemma El Fna main square and medina but far enough away from the crowds and noise that it feels like it's only private world the moment you step through the doors.  La Sultana (like Morocco as a country) deserves repeat visits. I hope so get back there as soon as I can. And if you're looking for a hotel in Marrakech don't look any further. This is as good as it gets.,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrendanByr
La Sultana Marrakech,Pinnochio10 wrote a review Sep 2018,40,A Riad from a tale of 1001 Nights,The Hotel is located in the Kasba and is very quiet.  The rooms are quiet large and opulent decorated but dark as the only natural light comes from the patio. Take a room with a terrace or balcony on the upper floor as these are much lighter.  Breakfast is ok but not what you would expect from a 5 star.  the restaurant offers a small choice of good Maroccan and European food unfortunately overpriced.  The service is slow but friendly.  The rooftop terrace is lovely and perfect for a drink or lunch or dinner.  The pool is small but sufficient. There are no pool showers.  The Spa offers various treatments and have excellent masseurs. I highly recommend a massage.  On the whole a good stay but expensive.,Date of stay: September 2018,,"Volketswil, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pinnochio10

La Sultana Marrakech,Vin C wrote a review Aug 2018,50,Excellence in the Old City,La Sultana tucked away in one of the bustling streets inside the Medina is the ultimate Moroccan Oasis. We arrived at La Sultana to a smiling staff who welcomed our early arrival and promptly served us mint tea and biscuits. We were checked into the Rhinoceros room located in the decorated white-marbled riad portion of the property equipped with his and her vanities a large Jacuzzi and an over-sized king bed. The centerpiece of the property is the pool that is enclosed in lush greenery with a hanging banana tree. From the pool extend to any of the riads to enjoy different decorations and antiques.    Housekeeping and the maintenance does a wonderful job keeping up after the room and property. The bell hops make sure you know how to get around the city and are able to call taxis instantly.    The hotel is about a 10 minute walk to Jemaa el-Fnaa and the Souks a route my girlfriend and I did day and night with no problems. The new city is about a 10 minute taxi away.    The gym was quite small and the treadmill did not seem to be working. The hotel did provide a converter for our electrical needs.

La Sultana Marrakech,AndreeaRRR wrote a review Aug 2018,50,Exceptional,Everything was above imagination!! The hotel/riad is located in the middle of old Medina so When you arrive in front of the Entrance and then at the reception you are sceptic and wondering if you arrived in the correct place but after you pass the reception...it is unbelivable what is happening what you see what is hidden in the back of that Doors. In my opinion is the most “morrocan” place that I’ve seen in this country! At the check-in We were upgraded to a better room so right from the begining we were impresionate and warmly welcomed. In that crazyness and agitation and noises of the old Medina this place is a Oasis of quiet of beautiful of good tastes of traditional luxury.

The team is so accommodating and welcoming and goes beyond the extra mile to ensure guests have a memorable experience. Not only is the riad AMAZING but it has a rich history. Saida took my mother and I on a tour of the riad and gave a great history of the place and moroccan culture. This was my first stay at La Sultana but certainly not my last.

La Sultana Marrakech,Jennifer H wrote a review Jul 2018,50,Paradise in the Heart of the Medina!,My boyfriend and I can't say enough good things about our stay at La Sultana Marrakech! Below are some of the highlights from our stay:    The Staff: The staff was extremely friendly and helpful throughout our stay at the hotel. They provided us with maps of the medina and recommendations on stores and restaurants to visit. They were also very amenable to changes in our reservations for dinner and their cooking class. The night before we had made reservations for the cooking class we decided we wanted to spend more time shopping in the medina and cancelling our cooking class reservation at the last minute was no problem at all. We also worked with the hotel to schedule a car pick-up and drop-off to the airport which went very smoothly.    The Hotel: The interior of this hotel is gorgeous!! Each small riad inside has it's own theme and we probably took more pictures of the hotel than we did the medina- it was that beautiful! The pool was also amazing and we enjoyed spending some time poolside with a pot of mint tea each afternoon. The atmosphere throughout the hotel automatically relaxes you upon entry. It is refreshing to walk into such a quiet pristine atmosphere after exploring the hustle and bustle of the medina.    The Room: We stayed in the Gazelle room which was spacious and decorated nicely. The turndown service was appreciated and we loved coming back to the room to find a delicious candied fig on each of our pillows! Air conditioning was important to us in Morocco and our room was always nice and cold upon arrival back at the hotel.    The Spa: We booked the Beldi Signature for the two of us at the spa and enjoyed a traditional hammam 50 minute full-body massage and facial. The spa is beautiful and the hammam massage and facial were very relaxing.    The Rooftop Restaurant: We had dinner at the rooftop restaurant on our first night at the hotel and it was a perfect introduction to Marrakech. Watching the sunset over the medina from the rooftop was unforgettable. The food was delicious and looking back on it we wish we had made more reservations for dinner during our stay as nothing else we ate was as good as the food at the hotel!    The Location: The hotel is located right next to the Saadian Tombs and about a 10-minute walk from Jemaa El Fna and the Souk. It is a perfect jumping off point to exploring the medina by foot.    Overall staying at this hotel really made our experience in Marrakech memorable and we would highly recommend staying here if you are visiting this city!,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Santa Monica, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JLinn88

La Sultana Marrakech,alexandra h wrote a review Jun 2018,10,Overpriced and noisy,I stayed at La Sultana in May. I thought.... I treat myself to a bit of luxury.  I should have known.. it started with the airport transfer. They asked 42 euros. I reserved a taxi privately for 10 euro instead. It’s a 7 min drive from the airport to the hotel.  I booked La Sultana for 1345 euro for 3 nights.  So you should think for that price you can expect a free transfer. (cheaper hotels do have free transfers)  I arrived at 11 at night and a got a dark room with no fresh air.  So I asked for an other room with daylight and windows which I could open for some air.  And noise free.  The manager told me there would be no noise in that room but this was unfortunately not true.  Light came in to the room very early as the curtains were to small😂  Breakfast was good but Lots of bees on the food and dirty tablecloths.  I felt cheated and lied to; the opposite of what I had expected of my stay.  So  next visit in Marrakech...

La Sultana Marrakech,Robert Gaxiola wrote a review May 2018,40,Honeymoon,This hotel was amazing. It was our first time in Marrakech. I booked this hotel after seeing it in a magazine for my honeymoon with my new wife months in advance. Even with all that lead time I still ended up booking the wrong month! That's right the wrong month. But when we showed up they welcomed us with open arms and provided us with a room immediately. They also only charged us for the days we spent there and didn't charge us for the week I had erroneously booked a month earlier by mistake. What a relief that was to me.    Now after our wedding in Bali the Sultana seemed like the perfect getaway and it was. The hotel is gorgeous. The interior design is fabulous and it feels like a true hidden gem inside a very ancient busy city. We hope to return one day. The staff and their attention to us were always friendly and helpful. The location was ideal as it's close enough to walk to the markets and enjoy the city. We will surely stay there again.    I suppose the only negative experience I liked the least was upon our last day the cleaning crew rushed in so fast to clean the room before my new wife physically stepped out of the door. It is never nice to rush a lady. Packing the last minute odds and ends is troublesome enough for anybody but to feel rushed after such a relaxing week was not a great way to send us off.    Aside from that I think anybody staying here will love the amazing rooms the location and the rooftop breakfasts and food.,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Singapore, Singapore",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertgaxiola

The + are the authenticity of the place with a traditional Moroccan architecture the swimming pool in the center of the riad the spa (my husband and I took the sultana signature massage which was amazing) the rooftop terrace which is very beautiful peaceful and relaxing the delicious food at the restaurants (through very pricey for Morocco so not very good value for money the food is excellent). The staff was very friendly and professional. In addition I got sick in the middle of the night and I appreciated the help of the receptionist who offered to send someone to go to get the medicine for me or to call a taxi to send me to a private clinic. The taxi arrived one minute later and I was at the clinic in less than 10min. This was much appreciated and makes the difference. The three minor things that could be improved are: at the reception you might have to wait for 10/15min before to be able to speak to the receptionist as there is only one person which I believe is too long for an hotel of this standing (I never had to do so in any other hotel of the same level) our bathroom smelled sewer during 1 day and the french pastries served at the breakfast are average.,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/746julieo

La Sultana Marrakech,RR22RR wrote a review Apr 2018,50,Perfectly Charming and Unique,After a long flight from the US this was our first stop in Morocco. It is perfectly situated in Marrakech and immediately welcomed us into the lovely culture. Beautiful hotel – so perfectly Moroccan in an elegant way – gorgeous touches everywhere you look and the staff is so lovely.  Our room on the African floor was quite unique and so much fun – we were immersed in the culture and loved it. We slept like crazy in such a comfortable room – btw – this was the only 5-star hotel we stayed that actually had working air conditioning. Anything you need – a touch away and shows up in your room.  We had dinner the first night at the hotel - kids were fussy about the menu so the chef made whatever they wanted. Luckily we had our first tagine and other Moroccan dishes – all perfectly delicious. It was hard to find another meal that matched the quality of La Sultana dinner.  The only miss-step was having drinks on the rooftop – which by the way is a major highlight of the hotel – overlooking the entire medina and a view of the moon. We found a lovely table and gave ourselves plenty of time to enjoy a cocktail on the roof before our dinner at an outside restaurant. There were only a couple of other people on the roof but the service was so incredibly slow that we were not able to stay and wait any longer for the drinks. We left 30 minutes after ordering with no service even after flagging down the bartender several times and were then yelled at by the waiter. We could have gone to a number of other rooftop bars to enjoy drinks and wish we had – this was the only problem we had in an otherwise fabulous time at La Sultana.,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RR22RR

La Sultana Marrakech,RovingLens wrote a review Mar 2018,50,Beautifully presented and outstanding service!,My wife and I stayed at La Sultana at the end of a two week trip to Morocco having first visited Essouria on the coast and the mountains before ending up in Marrakesh. Put simply this is one of the best hotels i have ever stayed in. When you step out of your taxi on the busy main street and step into the small quiet lane which leads to the hotel front door it is like stepping into another world. The phrase 'Oasis of Calm' pretty much described the contrast between the busy hubbub of Marrakesh and the luxurious interior of the hotel.  The architecture is wonderful - originally several traditional buildings now merged into one - with exceptional interior decor and a very calm and relaxing atmosphere throughout. the hospitality is first rate and every member of the staff that we dealt with were outstanding. They couldn't do enough for you and any request was dealt with quickly and efficiently with courtesy and a smile. The hotel offers excellent food and wines as you would expect with a rooftop restaurant offering either traditional Moroccan or Modern French cuisine both of which were excellent. I have stayed at a lot of very good hotels. this one was exceptional and i couldn't recommend it highly enough.,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Devon, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RovingLens

La Sultana Marrakech,ANSQ8 wrote a review Mar 2018,50,The place to be in Marrakech!!,Location: in the Unesco listed madina in Marrakech. A short walk to jemaa al fana square and Saadian tombs.  Facility: a hotel consisting of five chic and luxurious riads. A swimming pool a small gym a spa souvenir shop a restaurant on the swimming pool and another one on the roof top. and. Cooking classes are available at the roof top. Breakfast buffet is provided pool side up to 11 am. They provide local home made sweets for sale I bought some as gifts.  Check in: Saeeda gave a pleasant first impression thanks for a warm welcome.  Room: I checked into two different rooms the first one was too small dark clustered and kind of depressing. I asked for an upgrade and paid the difference to a bigger room with brighter colors in bahia riad.  Conciege: very attentive.  House keeping: consistent but not too generous.  Over all: a very nice authentic special hotel in the heart of old madina. Being there feels like being in a fairy tale house. However one thing that I thought the hotel lacked was generosity for example complimentary water is given only at check in and after you have to pay for it. I just can’t remember the last time I paid for water in a hotel.,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Hawalli Governorate, Kuwait",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ANSQ8

La Sultana Marrakech,Gudmundur P wrote a review Mar 2018,50,A week in absolute luxury,My wife and me stayed a week in February celebrating 20 years of our marriage.  We were a bit surprised entering a small lobby. We were met by people that greeted us most warmly. Since our room wasn't ready (we arrived at ten a.m.) they offered Hammam treatment free of charge.  The room was exceptionally beautiful with rose leaves on the bed and in the bathroom. We had dinner the first night. Service impeccable and the food fantastic.  Next day we made a trip to the Atlas mountains. On the third day we were offered a guide in Marrakesh the really showed us places that tourist don't know of. The same night we celebrated over a dinner at the hotel. All of the waiters gathered around us an sang a Moroccan melody.  We have traveled all over the world an often stayed at five star hotels.

Our room could not have been more spacious and clean and attention was put on little details such as fresh fruit Moroccan pastries and rose petals in the bathroom and dates on the bed in the evening. However service in the restaurant could have been more efficient and other personnel at the front desk seemed less attentive to our needs and lacked knowledge of options of places to visit or to eat.

La Sultana Marrakech,delaprut wrote a review Mar 2018,50,Like a grand vizier,This is a review which has been due for some time. The memories of going there are still full of life after almost one year. There is no fault to this hotel. It is located within the walls of the ancient medina and you can have a direct look on the courtyard of one Marrakech’s greatest attractions - the Saadian tombs (don’t miss them if you’re there they are fabulous).    Early April is an extraordinary time to visit. The weather is still pleasant during the day (30 degrees max) and is great during the morning. Staff told us that they had just opened the breakfast terrace as the week before the weather was still cold to eat outside.    Concierge are always ready to help. However for organised tours and airport transfers I think one may find much less expensive options if looking on the internet without necessarily losing on quality.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bucharest, Romania",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/delaprut
La Sultana Marrakech,JDTRAVELBrighton wrote a review Mar 2018,50,Tranquil luxury inthe heart of the medina,La Sultana is an oasis of peace and tranquillity located in the Medina and when you are inside it is easy to forget you are in heart of a vibrant working city. The property is made up of 5 riads all with their individual style and design so if you want something specific do check the hotel website and check the style which most suits your faste. The suites are fabulous all with their own theme and some stunning bathrooms. They are spacious and as well as the sitting area inside your suite there are sitting areas outside as well were you can utilise the in-room dining. The restaurant is either by the pool in the winter when we stayed or on the roof terrace. Round the pool is a great experience and the breakfast choices are good especially the various preserves on offer European and Moroccan. Dinner is also very special with a great menu. The pool is a good size and is very pretty in its design. The roof terrace is a must as you can sit in the sun watch the sunset over the roof of Marrakech and also peer over the balustrade and watch daily Marrakech life which is fascinating to see. We went for a special occasion and everythig was done to make our visit memorable. Overall a great location and a fabulous hotel we will definitely be back.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Brighton,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JDTRAVELBrighton
La Sultana Marrakech,Chris S wrote a review Feb 2018,50,Making our first trip to Marrakech 5 star,This place truly is unique. My wife and I came here for our babymoon. Best decision we made. From the establishment itself to the staff everything felt magical. The rooms were amazing. The rooftop was incredible for sunrise and sunsets as well as afternoon lounging. We can't say enough about how accommodating polite and respectful the staff was. Coming back from the hustle and bustle of the city to a literal oasis made the trip. The detail of La Sultana is unlike anything I've ever seen. That goes for Morocco as a whole but they spared no expense making this place incredibly peaceful and relaxing. The food was incredible as well and didn't leave much to be desired. Every morning we sat by the pool and watched the birds chirp about while sipping tea and picking breakfast from a 5 star spread. My personal favorite as the steak and eggs tagine. I ate it every single morning :)    Thanks again to the staff.

La Sultana Marrakech,Italy201161 wrote a review Feb 2018,50,Unique and wonderful place,We have been here twice once before child and now with our toddler. We love it! The riads are beautifully decorated each unique from the other and worth a tour in and of themselves. The staff is super attentive at breakfast and throughout the day. The spa provides wonderful treatments that I wish were available back home. For example the Royal Hammam treatment feels authentic and gives amazing results to your skin. This hotel is one of the main reasons we thought to return to Marrakech. We like Mamounia too but La Sultana is more private and intimate. We spent all day yesterday just sitting on the roof terasse in the sun (20 degrees) with no one else around but us. The main pool is heated so next time I’ll bring our bathing suits.

La Sultana Marrakech,Emma A wrote a review Feb 2018,50,Utterly superb in every way,We booked La Sultana on a whim without really knowing the riad hotel. It was the best decision! The hotel is five riads together and the whole place is stunning. There were so many highlights. The food is wonderful the atmosphere is elegant and calm. We were upgraded to a deluxe suite and it was beyond words - just so beautiful. The pinnacle for us was the staff. Each and every one from the doormen to the concierge to the wait staff to the cleaners - every one had a genuine smile and they could not do enough for us. Every restaurant recommendation was spot on Special mention goes to Halid who was just the loveliest man who got to know each of his guests and made sure our stay was beyond anything we could have hoped for. Another highlight was the Oud player who entertained at dinner in the hotel. Sat across the well lit swimming pool he lulled us beautifully as we ate our way through the sublime menu. I cannot recommend this place highly enough. The weather was unseasonably cold and the hotel did everything they could to ensure it was warm and welcoming and not impacted at all by the weather. The view from the roof top terrace of the snow-capped Atlas mountains was awesome. La Sultana is literally a walk to the Jamar al Fnar and a little oasis of calm in a bustling vibrant extraordinary city. I now cannot imagine staying anywhere else when we return (again and again) to Marrakech.

La Sultana Marrakech,Liz B wrote a review Feb 2018,50,Beautiful and Unique Hotel with a Lovely Rooftop,My husband and I stayed at La Sultana for three days in January 2018. The hotel itself is very interesting in that it is a combination of multiple riads that were melded together. Each section has been gorgeously decorated with various regional historical styles (Moroccan sub-Saharan African Moorish etc.). Each section has a well-decorated central courtyard and a sitting area.    Though we did not get to take much advantage of it due to the season a great feature of this hotel is the luxurious yet comfortable rooftop where you can take tea or have a cocktail in the evening. This area has nice sitting areas and a good view of the Atlas range and the Kasbah Mosque. We did get to take advantage of the spa and it was fantastic! I highly recommend the hammam treatment.    The room we had in the Moroccan wing (the Peacock) was comfortable and was beautifully decorated with the highlight being a stunning bathroom. We had dinner many of the nights by the central pool which dinner service was serenaded by a lute player and the wait staff was very attentive. The meal options were Moroccan and French so it was nice to be able to alternate.    The front desk staff were very pleasant and responsive and we felt they took good care of us.

We used the pool that was nice and had breakfast that had some good eggs benedict on the menu.

The staff are all very friendly and helpful -... this is the second time I have stayed at this hotel & on this occasion I was given an unexpected upgrade - either because I was a returning customer or maybe because they simply had a spare upgrade room - I'm not sure why but I was exceptionally happy with my room - there was a fantastic wooden window over my large bath that opened out into a little cushioned seating area with massive beautiful wooden windows opposite - when they were all open you could lie in the bath and look out into the court yard and hear all the birds - it was wonderful... we even had Clarins minis for free toiletries.... The hotel is brilliantly located - near to all the shops and the big square but also hidden away down a side street so it's quiet & a great escape from the noise & franticness outside.

La Sultana Marrakech,FivestarTraveler_off wrote a review Dec 2017,50,What an exzeptionell experience!,"La Sultana is really one of the most unique and most historical retreats we have ever been to. From the moment you are entering the small walkway to the entrance of the hotel we felt like being part of a fairytale of 1001 nights.    The stuff was very friendly and supported us in any kind of way. The welcome was warm and friendly. We had to wait a short while for our room but it didn't feel like a little while as we received a great cup of the Moroccan famous mint tea and we were discovering this amazing place all over.    Than our suite was ready and when we opened the door of our ""Camel"" suite we entered another world. This room is such an amazing experience. The passion for detail is amazing and we really haven't seen something similar before. It really blowed our minds away. The bathroom was like a secret treasure from another century (have a look at our pictures). We felt like an Arabian King and Queen during our stay with the ""La Sultana"".    In the evening we decided to have dinner on the beautiful rooftop terrace with outstanding views over the Medina. The food and service were exzeptionell as well and we really enjoyed our time up there.    After we had a wonderful breakfast in the Morning sun at another part of the rooftop terrace we booked a very famous treatment called ""Royal Hamam"" - Guys it was one of the most relaxing and purifying experience for our body and soul. The Spa stuff was super friendly are amazing in what they are doing. We can totally recommend this fantastic treatment and hope to get the next opportunity to find total tranquility at the Spa of ""La Sultana"" - Congratulations to this extraordinary job!    Overall we very much enjoyed our time in one of the most epic resorts we ever been to and would like to thank the whole team of La Sultana for their amiable nature and their unlimited kindness. We can TOTALLY recommend this place and hope to be back very soon!

La Sultana Marrakech,Terry M wrote a review Dec 2017,50,Marrakech at its finest!,La Sultana is by far and away one of the best hotels we have ever stayed at. The great location within the city is one thing but the ambiance and the decor of the La Sultana is exceptional. As well the service was amazing. In particular Saida the manager was most engaging and very helpful with any inquiry or needs that we had and as well her staff were tremendous. Everyone went out of their way to make our stay as memorable as possible.The restaurants within the hotel were very good and again the service was both friendly and professional. The rooms were spacious and very well appointed. We would highly recommend the La Sultana to anyone and everyone who wants to stay in a great hotel in a great city.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"West Vancouver, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bruceandterry2014
La Sultana Marrakech,Vmvr wrote a review Dec 2017,50,Wow,I knew Riads were beautiful but I didn’t think they could be this beatiful. La Sultana is actually 5 different riads connected so you get to experience different decor and style..So if you are into Moroccon decor and want to get a sense for more than just your hotel this place is perfect! Plus the rooftop terrace has the perfect view of the city and the pool is refreshing clean and instagram worthy. On top of that the service was great (they greeted us with tea and sweets while we waited for our room!). It’s a bit pricey but totally worth it.,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vmvr

From the moment we arrived I can only say great things about this placeincluding but not exhaustive...    The reception concierge team especially Mr Morocca/Tunisia. Your initial welcome intelligence and customer service is sheer class (and we have travelled to many places) you are an enormous credit to the Riad. Your boss (lady) is also warm engaging and truly welcoming.    The views layout and decor of the roof terrace. Sublime place to relax sleep and eat. Really this terrace is a perfect spot. You can see the great mosque and marrakech sunset extraordinaire here.    Our suite - the Swan.  Deeply relaxing with every amenity you need spacious with an incredibly comfortable bed. Lovely bed linen and a truly wonderful bathroom... See photos of bath below...    Food though we only ate in the hotel once outside of breakfast it was magnificent. Really yummy and beautiful presentation.    Location wise it's right next door to the royal tombs a five minute walk to the markets...

The grande and luxurious decore is thought into the last detail.

But the most wonderfull is the devoted staff. They made us feel almost home with their friendly attentive helpfull attitude always ready to provide guest with top quality service.

La Sultana Marrakech,mazelcg wrote a review Nov 2017,50,Amazing hotel and staff,I have travelled to some amazing places and am very grateful for that. What is superb about La Sultana are the teams of people that run this beautiful hotel. Every single person we came across were more than happy to help assist and advise. There is so much to do in Marrakech if you want to. Equally you can just do nothing but laze around. Once you enter the walls of the hotel you come across the peace all you can hear is trickling of the fountainsthe smell of rose water and the odd door shutting. So many corners to discover. Upstairs on the terrace you can catch some sunshine have a mint tea take a cooking class or just laze around reading a book.  What we liked to do was get a glass of something cold and wet and watch the sun go down. The hotel isn’t really suitable for young children (ok for babies)  Dinner is served around the pool which is on the ground floor. This time of year it gets rather nippy in the evenings so I advise taking slightly warmer clothing for the evenings. The hotel do provide lovely warm blankets for you to wrap up warm. The food is both traditional Moroccan and also European. We found there to be a rather nice selection of wine including Moroccan which I have to say was rather nice.    I have visited Morocco many times including Marrakech. The people of Morocco are extremely friendly I have to say that the people at La Sultana were amazing. I can highly recommend this hotel and the people that run it.

We loved the hotel.    On arrival there were two bell hops/greeters out on the street and good thing. Our taxi driver was lost and we got lucky to drive past the greeters. They took care of us got our luggage out helped me figure out what to pay and whisked us up the walkway and into La Sultana. Yes I tipped them well on the spot.    Our room bath and the entire property was just exquisite. Quiet beautifully decorated and refined. Easy to find a private nook to read a book or daydream.    The breakfast presentation was a highlight of the day. Great food and really great coffee.    We leaned on the front desk staff for dining and tour recommendations. They helped us with some outstanding evenings at a Riad style restaurant.    We'll be back.

La Sultana Marrakech,Ed S wrote a review Nov 2017,50,An Amazing Property,This is one of the top properties I've stayed at in my lifetime of travel. The property itself is stunning. There are 4 riads that make up La Sultana. Each decorated in a unique motif. The property also has stunning common areas from the spa to the pool to our favorite the roof top bar restaurant and lounge area. Have drinks and dinner here. Then in the morning as the sun comes up you will have breakfast in a separate roof top area looking out across the minarets of the city.My favorite part of this lovely property is the staff. From the conceirge(s) who were so helpful especially Hussan and Saida to the omnipresent bell staff to the breakfast servers who remember your menu preferences from the day before.

La Sultana Marrakech,Netta75 wrote a review Oct 2017,50,One of the most stunning hotels I have ever stayed in,"This is one of those places where as soon as you arrive you mentally start planning a return trip. I have no words for how beautiful the decor and design is. As you can see from the photos it's not done up in a typical ""luxury"" style but is traditional Moroccan with eclectic elements. Even the tiniest details are done to perfection. The hotel combines several riads each with its own personality. I can't remember the name of the riad we stayed in but I do remember the African riad (at least that's what I believe it's called) which is where I would want to stay next time. Those rooms have balconies and a hot tub in the central courtyard and in my opinion it is the most beautiful out of all the riads. The staff is friendly and helpful. The food is good but not spectacular...but then again I didn't stay here specifically for the dining. The location is close to all -- easily walkable to the Bahia Palace Djema al-Fna and Koutoubia mosque and next door to the Saadian tombs although you will need to take a cab to get to the Majorelle Gardens. We were originally going to stay in Selman Marrakech when this property had no availability for our dates but Selman cancelled on us at the last moment and an availability opened up in La Sultana and I am so glad it worked out that way.

La Sultana Marrakech,cellapink wrote a review Oct 2017,50,Gorgeous Property,This is one of the most beautiful hotels I have stayed in. It is full of art and antiques and the architecture is stunning. The service is top-notch. The breakfast is excellent and offered in a lovely rooftop setting. Despite this there are a few issues which warrant improvement in my opinion. The pool is situated in a courtyard. It is not a very large pool area and there is no air-flow yet smoking is allowed. One afternoon we tried to relax and were accosted with cigarette smoke from a group sitting at a table in the pool courtyard who must have chain-smoked the entire afternoon. It was so unpleasant. There is a spacious rooftop at La Sultana and I feel that smoking should be limited to the rooftop area. Also we had a suite with a third bed in a loft area. My daughter who lives in Marrakech wanted to stay with us for convenience. The hotel charged a whopping 90 Euro per night on top of our room price (almost $800 per night to begin with). Seemed a bit steep for a set of twin sheets and an extra towel. Overall though we had a wonderful stay at La Sultana.,Date of stay: October 2017,,Geneva,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cellapink

La Sultana Marrakech,Francisco André wrote a review Sep 2017,50,A nearly perfect Riad experience,Being the first time in Marrakesh we wanted to stay at an authentic Riad within the Medina - the city’s old town. Soon enough we decided La Sultana was the appropriate hotel for us and even though we had very high expectations they were absolutely surpassed.    Down a very small alley near the busy market street you are greeted by a carpet and lantern lined entry. Impressive doors open to welcome you to the small reception where the staff is waiting to ensure every moment of your stay is faultless. And it was indeed.    Each room décor reflects that of the Riad ours was an amazing suite called Buffalo. With a huge bed on a marble platform fireplace a loft seating area and not to forget the luxury bathroom with jacuzzi. Made-up of five separate Riads no detail is forgotten. On the top of that La Sultana is managed and taken care of by some exceptional staff that deliver amazing service.    At the gorgeous Sultana Spa we tried the Royal Hammam followed by 50-minute signature massage and it was an amazing experience. We also recommend trying the Moroccan tasting menu at the restaurant which during the summer has a very romantic setting at the terrace but doesn’t keep up with the quality of the rest of the hotel in my honest opinion. On the other hand breakfast are varied and simply delicious.    Overall it was such a memorable stay at a top-notch hotel.

La Sultana Marrakech,FlyingTheCoop wrote a review Sep 2017,50,Picture perfect,This is a stylish hotel with exceptional customer service great food and wonderful rooms. The five riads that make up the hotel contain 28 guest rooms a roof top terrace restaurant and bar and plenty of nooks and crannies to relax or meet with friends. The location via a short and private laneway is very central and entry from the circular road surrounding the medina is very easy. The heat of the Marrakech day is quickly swept aside when night falls but the close proximity of the rooms means that the open windows allow little privacy from the neighbours. You do of course have the option of bolting the door and closing the shutters with a vigorous air-conditioner to wash away the day's heat.,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Australia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FlyingTheCoop

It's a boutique hotel with 28 rooms or so (not quite sure) located in the heart of the old town so every thing is close by the souk Jamma'a Fenna Square restaurant and cafes. It was our first time experience Moroccan riyadh kind of hotels. It's beyond beautiful. Staff are so lovely professional helpful and kind. Hassan at reception was a great and very helpful guy. As for breakfast it's served at the rooftop where views are breathtaking. We also had the breakfast by the pool the first day because it was raining and it was just as beautiful experience. They also have a GYM that's small but has everything we needed. I would highly recommend it to any visitor who's interested in culture and history but wants to enjoy luxury at the same time.

The rooms are gorgeous ( we had Rhinoceros and Lion) the pool area is quite small but feels super special and the rooftop is the most beautiful spot for breakfast and drinks.

La Sultana Marrakech,JASON L wrote a review Aug 2017,50,The Oasis in middle of hustle bustle of Marrakech,"This hotel is truly live up to the name ""The Oasis in middle of hustle bustle of Marrakech""    Once you pass the main big golden door u can feel the peace and tranquility inside of this hotel the big room with all marble bathroom very clean and the bed so comfy.  Hotel and rooms deco is like one of those Arabian nights movies or like your in a palace with royal treatment truly 5 star luxury service.  Rooftop bar is cool with selection of music daily having a drink watching sunset.  This hotel is inside the old Medina but yet sooo quiet very peaceful from the inside hotel is not far to main square Jemaa el-Fnaa and other tourists attractions.  Please note if its your first time in Morocco best to arrange your own airport pick up or get La Sultana to arrange a pick up as taxis in Marrakech is not meter and they try to make money on tourist so u have to ask and agree with a fee before u get on otherwise they will charge you lots of💲💲    Last but not least.. the staffs and the level  Of service at La Sultana was impeccable the lady at the front desk (sorry i couldn't remember her name) was so helpful and the staffs from bars rooftop was excellence.

La Sultana Marrakech,whyshyme wrote a review Aug 2017,50,Luxurious haven in Marrakech,From the moment we stepped into this hotel we knew it was a dream come true. You truly feel as if you are in a Moroccan Palace and the staff make you feel like royalty.    Needless to say the service at a 5-star luxury hotel like La Sultana Marrakech was impeccable. From the moment I walked through the entrance I felt a warmth kindness and attentiveness which as the days went on we realized that despite being widely traveled we had never experienced before.    The staff quickly settled us in and welcomed us with traditional sweets and of course Moroccan mint tea. The whole team was genuinely so nice truly helpful and very professional.    One of the best parts of our trip was a breakfast on the rooftop. This was the best breakfast we had in Morocco by far. I loved it and it was worth waking up on time for which I don’t usually say. Mostly I liked cheese and chia pudding for breakfast. The homemade pastries were great too.    The hotel itself is beautiful clean and well-located. And you get the authentic atmosphere that it's placed in the middle of the old town from Marrakech. It's a walking distance 15 min from the El fana square.    This enchanting place is full of ambiance and wonder. We were overwhelmed at how amazing every single detail was. Lots of nice little corners to hang out and great pools where we escaped the chaos of the Marrakech. It was so delightful in the heat of Morocco!    We were in the Tiger room. it is a great big room with a very nice bathroom. Turns out I actually like taking baths! I loved relaxing in the tub here after long days of shopping and haggling in the markets.    Our bedroom matched the historical design and architecture. It was aesthetically exquisite as well as spacious and comfortable. It was maintained to the highest standards of cleanliness.    All in all my visit to La Sultana opened my eyes and gave me a taster into a new world of design style and breathtaking luxury. If you are looking for a place to awaken the senses push boundaries and give you a true appreciation for design Marrakech has it all and La Sultana exhibits the very best of it. Frankly speaking I wish there was a chance to give the 6th star because this hotel deserves it.,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whyshyme

We had been traveling on the coast for 9 days and wanted an over the top luxe experience to leave on. Yep-- we got that. It's like the Versaille of Morocco-- like a palace inside ornate spectacular and opulent. Service is 5 star in every sense of the word from the greeting when you arrive to arranging everything for us for easy delivery to the airport-- including early morning coffee personal wake-up call filling out our immigration forms and taxi waiting. This all before 6am. We have 3 teenage boys-- so staying one night was perfect for us-- got a lovely over the top experience but probably not a great spot for kids-- to fancy quiet for a long stay. But our kids will remember the bathtub in their room for the rest of their lives-- right out of a palace sunken marble extravaganza.

La Sultana Marrakech,loa380 wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Beautiful hideaway,As part of our honeymoon we wanted to try a country and a city that none of us had visited before.  So after pro and cons we decided to visit Marrakech.  I looked through the different kind of hotels offers in the city and decided that we a stay in a classic Riyadh would be the perfect local experience    The choose came to La Sultana based on the location close to one of the city ports so that it would be easy to get in and out of the old city    At the same time La Sultana looked very authentic and beautiful.    We were not disappointed. From the first friendly welcome so the final goodbye we felt welcome at the hotel.    The terrace of the hotel to very nice and quiet when you come 'home' from a long day full of impressions.    We were in the Tiger room. it is a great big room with a very nice bathroom. But I was a bit challenged by the fact that you could not really open a window. this might be part of the Riyadh charm that all windows are facing the inner courtyard. But next time I am staying in a Riyadh I will ask for a room with windows closer to the 'real' air...  The other minor issue with the room was that the sent was a little stuffy    We had breakfast at the hotel every day during our 4 day stay. The breakfast is nice and the environment on the terrace is just perfect. The Ramadan started while we were visiting Morocco. But you are still able to get a cold glass of wine for your lunch and during the day if needed.    We had dinner once at the hotel. the day we arrived. Nice but not outstanding.    We tried a coupon massage at the hotel and that was a great experience.    The decor at the hotel is so beautiful the small gardens the hidden corners all the roses and so on.

La Sultana Marrakech,Chanda Chaudhary wrote a review Jun 2017,40,A beautiful property and an excellent location : a real experience,Located inside the Imperial City's walls the first thing which one notices is la Sultana's sense of history . After a painstaking 3-year restoration which involved the Historical Monuments Association La Sultana has created an authentic luxury property with superb attention to authentic Moroccan design and architecture.    Its 28 rooms are quite dramatic and decorated in a Moroccan maximalist style. Personally I absolutely love the details - zellij-style courtyards carved cedar wood shutters and ceilings in the bathrooms delicate latticework in the garden to name only a few.    Spa is excellent - especially its bathing pools and water feature. I am not n expert of the Hammam treatments but I'd be pleasantly surprised if I anything would top-off my treatment here.    Staff is fabulous - friendly thoughtful and adjusting. I was at La Sultana over xmas which happens to be a super busy time but all my requests were handled with efficiency courtesy and warmth.

La Sultana Marrakech,JASCQ wrote a review Jun 2017,50,Family trip to Morocco,La Sultana is a beautiful peaceful oasis in the middle of a very busy medina & a 10 minute walk to Jemaa el Fna & the souk. We arrived at this riad exhausted from a long night of travel & without the suitcases for my 2 children. Saida & the rest of the crew were warm friendly patient & very helpful in getting us settled in & helping to communicate with the airport to find our bags.    The ambience in this hotel is unique & exceptional. Each room has a different theme. No 2 rooms are the same. The pool area is beautiful & serene. After a walk around the medina or the souk in 110 F returning to the hotel & a swim in the pool is glorious.  Breakfast on the roof top terrace is delicious. Dinner in the same spot is also fantastic.    One little amenity that we greatly appreciated is the never ending supply of bottled water. It is not safe to drink the tap water & in that heat water is essential. There are always bottles in the mini fridges & as you head out through the lobby they are happy to give you each a cold bottle of water for your walk in the heat.    Another small amenity that we greatly appreciated was the AC in each room. So fantastic to escape the heat & recharge with a cold room to sleep in.

Entering the hotel you will see beautiful doors surrounding it which happen to be people’s home’s – YES AT THE ENTRANCE! The hotel drop off you think “omg where am I” and our driver had to assure us that this was the hotel it’s super traditional and don’t worry about a thing.    You literally walk in and it’s like your in a different world!    Stunning architecture super traditional kind of like a fancy home for someone super rich and famous.

La Sultana Marrakech,ochio33 wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Magical stay in Marrakech!,We spent three nights in late March and would recommend anyone visiting Marrakech to stay at La Sultana without hesitation. The hotel is absolutely beautiful a combination of 4 different riads that have been fully renovated and adapted to be a 5 star luxury boutique hotelalways maintaining the character and charm of the original buildings. The decoration just adds on to the whole magical experience once you walk in which feels like the perfect paradise to relax and unwind after spending the day out discovering buzzing Marrakech.  La Sultana is a hidden gem in the old part of the Medina which makes it ideal to enjoy a nice walk to the main attractions of the city. The hotel location is just next to the very famous Saadian Tombs (they offer guests fast track entry so you don´t have to queue!) and only 10 min walk away from Jemaa El Fna square and the souks.  Even if you are just spending a couple of nights book a table in the Restaurant for dinner you won´t regret it! Food is delicious (the Tangia is a MUST try) service is top class romantic ambiance and live traditional music; it is the perfect way to end your day. The hotel has an amazing rooftop terrace with panoramic views of the city and is open all day from breakfast till dinner to enjoy a refreshing drink or a cocktail at night. On our last day we decided to take a Cooking Class in the morning (which also takes place in the rooftop terrace) and we absolutely loved it! It was a great experience and then you get to have for lunch the menu you have prepared together with the Chef!  We also booked their signature La Sultana Massage make sure you book in advance and arrive 30 mins before your appointment so you can get to relax in the Spa pool!  The one thing that really stands out at La Sultana is their fabulous staff from Saida´s team at the Reception & Concierge to the Spa and the Restaurant (breakfast lunch dinner they were all fantastic) they all make you feel so welcome and well looked after from the moment you step in. Staff approached us just to check on our stay and ask if we needed anything just making sure we were enjoying our time. They were discrete at all times but so caring that we didn´t want to leave!  Thank you to all the Team at La Sultana for an unforgettable stay!,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ochio33

Suites are really gorgeous. The food is delicious spa treatments were excellent. My only critique is that service can be inattentive when things get busy. We stayed here during high season and over Easter Sunday. All of the staff are incredibly warm and gracious but a few times when they got ""in the weeds"" in the bar and restaurant we didn't see or hear from people for a while.

I would recommend the desert dinner under the stars and the guided tour of the central market. Our tour guide Ahmed was amazing and took us to some great stalls and restaurants.

La Sultana Marrakech,gazzamuppet wrote a review Apr 2017,50,"Fantastic, luxury hotel - calmness in a frenetic city!",Where do I start? You need someone to take you as it is very difficult to find next to the Saidian tombs an alley behind a shop leads to an unassuming doorway within nice architecture with an unassuming reception. Once behind reception wow! The place leads of into a series of small riads with rooms around each. The riads are luxurious and relaxing the rooms are very luxurious.    It is an oasis of luxury calm and peacefulness within a frenetic city. You can sit up on the rooftop where you can have a drink or meal and look down at the bustle or watch the nesting storks.    The rooms are luxurious all decorated slightly differently (we had the ‘swans room’). Large bathrooms with big sunken baths his and hers washbasins a good power shower and niceties such as bath slippers and robes and leather bedroom slippers. Fruit dates nuts and cakes are waiting upon arrival in your room. The bedroom was aslo of a good size. The rooms have shutters and several layers of glazing making them pretty dark and quiet if you wish.    To while away the time you can sit in one of the luxurious courtyard riads or use the main swimming pool or the smaller warmer pool in the spa or indeed take one (or more) of the wonderful spa treatments.    All the staff were very friendly and attentive (without being obtrusive) and nothing was too much trouble.    Food was excellent (even for vegetarians) and the breakfast buffet was quite extensive (fresh and organic). A wonderful place to stay that couldn’t be faulted in any way. Not the cheapest of places (by any means) but if you fancy a bit of pampering and luxury then this is the place!,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Farnham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gazzamuppet

Little touches like mint tea to greet us and an assortment of Moroccan treats in our room made us feel welcomed and pampered. The concierge gave us useful tips for what to see and do during our stay (and what to avoid) and also arranged a day trip to Essaouira.

La Sultana Marrakech,fraser_sw5 wrote a review Mar 2017,40,Great and interesting hotel... needs a little attention,Wow what a fantastic building  a labyrinth of amazing courtyards pools and interesting corners and cubby holes. The hotel is full of African artwork and at times feels more llke a museum.  The roof terrace is a perfect spot to unwind with large sunny spacious seating and great views. The service was also excellent.  The only downside might be that the rooms themselves are very dark. Even withthe lights on it still seemed dark and therefore lacked a feeling of space.  Although the rooms was well decorated some of the sockets didnt work and the electrics were in need of updating.  The other noticeable thing was that for some reason the towels were old and a bit threadbare. Its such a simple thing to fix. The pool towels were much nicer than the small towels in our room.  Breakfast was pretty good and had lots of choices..I really liked the coffee.  We did not eat dinner here it always looked a little formal and quiet.  When its hot enough I presume people choose to eat on the roof and that looked like it would be very good.  The spa was OK but small and the main pool is fine.  The staff were excellent  Its a short walk to town and we had no problems at all with the location.,Date of stay: February 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fraser_sw5

The tables by the pool are a nice touch and the dim lighting create a very romantic setting.    Our waiter was attentive and had a sense of humour! We had a full 3 course meal which was brilliant from start to finish! Oh and the cauliflower soup was probably the best soup I have ever had!

It was my first time in Marrakech and I loved the experience.    La Sultana is everything you can expect from a luxury Riad: gorgeous exclusive and yet traditional at the same time. It has a fabulous spa with a heated pool fireplace beautiful covered outside patio for dinners in wintertime as well as very helpful and friendly staff.    I was given an upgrade to the “Dromadaire” room which had a palatial bathroom fit for kings and queens (see photo) and plenty of space and luxury amenities. The only thing that puzzled me a bit was the towels which were not the luxurious fluffy type usually found in such high-end accommodation.    I had dinner at the hotel and was pleasantly surprised with the vegetarian options available. Everything from the soup Moroccan salads to the mushroom risotto was absolutely delicious. The beautiful poolside surroundings and soft music played by a local musician completed the romantic atmosphere.

The bedrooms are outstanding with everything you could wish for. An upgrade to The Tiger Room would be a wonderful experience. It is the most beautiful bedroom I have ever seen....  The traffic can be quite daunting but after hiring a car we were escorted out of the city by a lovely gentleman from the hotel who led us on his motor cycle to a place where we could take the road up to the Atlas Mountains.  The rooftop terrace was just lovely. So relaxing and the calling to prayer from the mosque nearby proves very atmospheric.

La Sultana Marrakech,somanyholidays wrote a review Jan 2017,50,Beautiful hotel,"My partner and I stayed here for 4 nights in March 2016.    We had dinner at the hotel on a previous trip to Marrakech in 2015 and we decided we would stay here on the next trip as it so lovely!    We had a lovely suite with a window in to a gorgeous white internal atrium.    The weather was a bit chilly in the evening so we had dinner by the indoor pool most nights. All the food tastes great and was presented beautifully - no complaints! Even when I misunderstood the menu and ordered ""sweet breads"" (I am a vegetarian) there was no issue and they quickly brought me a lovely soup!    The hotel is very calm and serene...very different from the streets of Marrakech!

La Sultana Marrakech,Tom S wrote a review Jan 2017,30,"Beautiful hotel, below par experience and service","I booked a week here through Small Luxury Hotels for a relaxing break with my partner before Christmas. Highly recommend booking through Small Luxury Hotels because they will provide you with a free upgrade to a suite if one is available - we were given a Deluxe Suite.    The hotel is meticulously designed with an incredible standard of detail wherever you look. One of my favourite things is that the hotel has lots of spaces reading rooms and places to sit despite only having 27 rooms. This means you can always find somewhere secluded to sit in peace if you want to.    I often stay in 5* hotels for business and leisure and have experienced a variety of approaches and standards.    The service and stay here was not 5* to my mind for the following reasons:  - Wi-Fi was intermittent  - We found a large cockroach in the bathroom  - Our room backed on to a kitchen which was quite noisy  - Workmen were quite active around the hotel drilling and hammering fairly early in the morning  - The mini-bar included ""complimentary"" soft drinks and water but this was never refreshed.  - There was no iron or ironing board in the room - although I never asked for one to be brought over  - The pool table on the roof top is missing a ball and doesn't work correctly  - Prices for breakfast and drinks were excessive given the location - £18pp/day for breakfast £6 for a beer    Another issue that frustrated me was asking advice about some tours. I specifically wanted to visit some of the villages in the Atlas mountains for a hike but I was immediately shown an £800 half-day ""Luxury VIP"" trip into the desert at night. This was nothing like I asked for and it was obvious my request wasn't being listened to so I ended up booking an excursion online.    Overall the hotel is an amazing property and it's a great place to relax. It just isn't run to the same standard that most 5* properties adhere and as such can't justify it's price - I felt it was overpriced despite being given an upgrade.",Date of stay: December 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomsZ5435DH
La Sultana Marrakech,CUTrekker wrote a review Jan 2017,50,Beautiful Riad in the heart of Marrakech's Old City,"Had a lovely five night stay at the La Sultana Marrakech riad. Beautiful hotel all around and each room is unique; we stayed at a ""Pur-Sang"" horse themed room complete with a saddle and luxurious bathroom. It's also located very close to some popular tourist attractions and restaurants - within walking distance of the El Badi and Bahia palaces the Koutoubia mosque the Jemaa el-Fnaa as well as the Cafe Clock restaurant. We had a good experience with the staff and they were always very courteous.    The hotel's restaurant and spa were also amazing; even if you aren't staying here it's worth checking out the spa and eating at the restaurant.    The hotel itself is a little harder to find being located in a narrow street of the old city but they usually have a watchman outside for visitors and help direct taxi drivers.",Date of stay: December 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CUTrekker

La Sultana Marrakech,okleyla wrote a review Dec 2016,50,Wished I lived here,Being in Marrakech and walking into La Sultana we felt as if we were reincarnated back in time as royalty. The detail of the decor and layout of the entire riad was luxurious. We loved ending the night with mint tea on the roof. And the food was the best we had in Morocco. The seven salads have transformed our eating habits in the US. The service at the front desk in the restaurants and on the roof were unmatched. I have never met such friendly funny and accommodating staff. The spa was breath taking. My husband and I went for the hammam package and couldn't be more delighted. It's made him into a massage and spa-enthusiast.    On our last day we were overcome with such sadness that we had to leave the large comfortable bed and dreamy bathroom. We visited Morocco on our honeymoon and we wanted to travel around the country so we only stayed three nights.

La Sultana Marrakech,evo1972 wrote a review Nov 2016,50,Traditional Luxury Hotel,My wife was lucky enough to win a 3 night stay at La Sultana from which we've just returned. I cannot be effusive enough in my praise for the place: all aspects of the stay far exceeded both our expectations.    The staff couldn't have been more helpful and friendly. No request was considered too small and they always ready with a smile.The room was very nicely appointed clean and comfortable and the hotel itself was a wonderful gem of a place you could quite literally get lost in! Around every corner there seemed to be a new room to relax in.    I have to mention the food which was absolutely first class. On two nights we had the Moroccan & Occidental taster menus which both delivered two of the best culinary experiences of my life (the Moroccan menu just edging it for me!). Although I must say my favourite dish of the stay was the local pigeon pie I had as a starter the first night there! Delicious!    Lastly the site of the hotel makes it an ideal location to explore the city and yet remain secluded from it's hustle & bustle. Probably about a 10/15 minute walk to the main Jemaa al Fna square and the souks next-door to the Saadian tombs and close to a couple of the palaces for those wishing to explore the historical sites.

The décor the ambiance even the setting. I do give some credit to the staff at the reception and in the dining room and roof (bar and so-called fitness room) but the overall experience left us feeling somewhat down. The food was awful and they could not even make a simple dry martini! I had to go behind the bar to show them what to do. Breakfasts at the hotel were OK; dinner? Go elsewhere. As for the ""fitness room"" that is a non-starter. The few pieces of equipment were ancient (except for the weights!) and the tv did not work. Need I say more.

The room was fairly spacious bed comfortable. Breakfast was great served upstairs on the roof in a beautiful setting.    Had dinner one night in the restaurant... they locate it next to the pool in the main courtyard and there was a man singing and playing a Moroccan type guitar.

The roof gardens are beautiful and afford views of the Atlas Mountains the ancient Saadian Tombs and nesting storks. The décor throughout is extremely decorative in the Moroccan style and there are nooks and crannies everywhere where one can escape fellow guests although with only 21 rooms there are not that many. Our suite was huge and ornate with a balcony overlooking the beautiful swimming pool which is kept at a comfortable temperature. Everything is provided for your comfort including sunhat beach bag beach towels bathrobes slippers toiletries kettle together with fruit sweetmeats and nuts.

La Sultana Marrakech,mindythelion wrote a review Oct 2016,50,Traditional yet luxurious experience in the heart of Marrakech,We stayed at La Sultana Marrakech in October 2016 and it was one of the best all-round hotels we stayed in during our full 3-week Moroccan trip.    One of the best thing about this hotel is the location. It's in the heart of Marrakech and everything is walking distance - Jemaa El Fna square with the traditional souks the Saadian Tombs the Royal Palaces and the Bahia Palace plus a ton of restaurants. The other thing that makes La Sultana special is the way it combines authentic Moroccan style with genuine luxury making it the perfect oasis to escape to after a busy day exploring the old town.    There are two pools here one on the main floor and another on the rooftop terrace. Both pools are serviced by the restaurant throughout the day and provide a gorgeous ambiance for vacation photos. The spa is also very popular here though we did not have a chance to try it ourselves. Make sure you try a few items from the restaurant on the terrace the food here is reasonably priced for a hotel and is as exceptional as the ambiance (we loved the lamb!).    We spent three nights in the Camel room and I'd recommend it as the perfect room for couples travelling together. It's on the second floor of the hotel and is very quiet with what felt like our own veranda facing inside the hotel looking upon African-themed sitting areas as well as a huge twinkling chandelier and lush plants below. We spent quite a bit of time on our laptops from this indoor veranda and I'm happy to report that the wifi was quite strong for us as well.    All-in-all La Sultana was one of the highlights of our trip and we would 100% recommend it to any couples or families looking to experience Marrakech while feeling right at home surrounded by true Moroccan luxuries.,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Vancouver, BC",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mindythelion

You would not appreciate the beauty from outside.The terrace offers all kinds of cuisine. We had a club sandwich and mohitos as it was lunch time.  Excellent views of the Kasbah and the the souks. Enjoyed sitting under a covered canopy with Morroccon decor.

La Sultana Marrakech,Aram Tavitian wrote a review Sep 2016,50,Great experience,Visited La Sultana for their hammam followed by dinner on their rooftop terrace. The hammam was very very good. Felt incredibly good and relaxed afterwards. Following the hammam we had dinner at the rooftop restaurant which was also great. Amazing service and great food. The restaurant serves Moroccan and European food. Both the hammam and the restaurant are worth visiting.

La Sultana Marrakech,xeno111 wrote a review Sep 2016,30,"Lovely rooms, but serious flaws",It's a beautiful property and the staff is eager to please but for a property charging premium prices it fell short in many important places.    The cooking class was a great example of this. Absolutely do not take their cooking class. There are many other places in Marrakech that offer cooking classes and I wished we had chosen one of them instead. The instructors were friendly but spoke limited English and didn't have answers to basic questions about Moroccan food. They knew just enough to walk us through the recipes. But the experience fell short of cooking classes we have taken in the past where we actually learned something about the cuisine and culture rather than just follow a recipe as we did here.    In general we found the food and drink options on the property to be lacking high in price and low in quality which is a shame because the place is so lovely. We would have spend more time but after a couple of disappointing meals we ate and drank elsewhere. We found food at other riads and restaurants to be far higher quality at a far lower price.    The concierge service was also lacking. We didn't get great recommendations and a staffer made a mistake on setting up a booking. Frustrated we stopped asking and relied on our own research. A property charging high prices should be equipped with people who can provide solid advice.    These kinds of shortcomings would be excusable at a budget property but not at this price point. It's a shame because the property and rooms are lovely with beautiful details and lots of great places to explore and relax in including a great pool and rooftop.,Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xeno111

La Sultana Marrakech,Betty Rice wrote a review Sep 2016,30,Beautiful hotel - average everything else,- exquisite spa beautiful decor the nicest maids in the world!    - had to change rooms due to air conditioning not working. Staff left our luggage for over an hour and we had to collect it from the old room ourselves which had been left wide open.    - The hotel called a doctor on request and collected a prescription for me although I would expect this level of customer service for the price.    - Staff were OK but nothing like we had heard. Below average customer service except the maids who were amazing.    - Disappointing food despite the hotel being aware of our dietary requirements they made no preparation to cater for this. Seriously my husband was offered a tomato sandwich...    - Spa needs a second mention as it was amazing.    - I doubt we would pay a crazy amount of money to return (we were on our honeymoon and expected the hotel to make more of a fuss about this!) but I would return to the spa.    - The location is brilliant but would recommend people visit the La Sultana in Oualidia over this one!,Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bettyrice
La Sultana Marrakech,Claudia R wrote a review Sep 2016,40,"Charmy, excellent location, relax place",My husband and I traveled to Morocco with another couple of friends. After have been to Casablanca we drove our own car to Marrakesh. As we members of SLH we could not miss out La Sultana Marrakesh. Hidden in a small road the hotel has a unique gate from which you can never image there are 5 entire riad inside! Arrived in the evening we were welcome with fresh milk and some sweet Moroccan biscuits while sitting in a table at the roof top. Just with this atmosphere we were more than satisfied. Our room was an enchanting style with huge bed fire place and a big bath (which we never tried coz we figured out that the time and the water to cover the bath could have been thousand of liters!). The only thing we were disappointed was the air condition that was broken. However the staff immediately gave us another room to repair the inconvenience. We decide later to go back to our room the day after once they fix because my husband preferred a balcony room for his smoking needs! Beyond that we all of us highly recommend La Sultana! The reasons why are various: firstly human resource are more than friendly and professional (a special thanks to Hasan who helped us out for a desert trip to Er Chagaga!) and never rude; secondly the food is more than fabulous (sheep kebab- as in the picture- and the Moroccan salad) and beside we tried the restaurants outside La Sultana restaurant (even if a bit late to serve!) for us ranks the highest position.

We stayed June 30 - July 2. The entire staff is excellent and the service is 5 star. There are four themed sections of the Riad; African Moorish Moroccan and Spanish. Each is very beautiful relaxing and peaceful. Because there are a limited number of rooms and suites there are plenty of quiet areas to relax and enjoy. There is a pool quiet fountains and an amazing rooftop for drinks breakfast dinner sunbathing and jacuzzi. There is a wonderful spa too. The meals were excellent. We had breakfast each day and dinner one evening. The staff was also very helpful making reservations with a local restaurant on the second night. We highly recommend La Sultana.

La Sultana Marrakech,MavenMomma wrote a review Aug 2016,50,Warm and Welcoming Opulence,"I am overcome with a surreal amount of giddy glee when I think about the wonderful stay my travel buddy and I enjoyed at La Sultana. So in an attempt to organize my thoughts and to make this review informative I broke my review out by category:    Service    A month prior to our arrival I begin to email the staff about my itinerary included with the mechanics was a disclaimer that my friend and I were women traveling alone and as such were apprehensive and needed some guidance and recommendations. I received an email back the next morning from La Sultana specifically; Hassan with a very detailed itinerary including tour guides excursions and car pick up as requested. This interaction very much put myself and friend at ease. Ladies traveling solo...I would 100% endorse that you stay here.    Upon arrival at La Sultana we were greeted by the friendly and accommodating staff who from start to finish they made our stay seamless and wonderful. Thinking back every request question and need was attended to.  2 things I will call out as I believe they are an example of exemplary service:  1. I mentioned that I left me pool shoes at home accidentally and later that evening a pair of leather house shoes were left in my room.  2. My friend mentioned that she was going to need to buy a small bag to carry all her purchases home since we were busy packing to leave the property a bellman went out to source and purchase a small suitcase in her stead. Talk about a great sendoff!    The rooms    Spacious with beautiful decor the rooms are opulent yet warm and welcoming. Your stay is well thought out from the snacks that await you in your room to the little extras like sun hats tote bags and extra towels. I especially loved the wood doors that shutter the main door for sun and privacy. But my favorite thing about my room (Ibis) was the shower...mental note to buy one for home.    The property    We spent most of our time while in hotel at the pool or on the rooftop. Both areas offer everything you need to spend a lazy posh afternoon away from the busy suks and sites. My favorite place in hotel was the whirlpool on the rooftop where I spent most evenings reading while sipping my mint tea.    The Restaurant    The cuisine was exceptional. I enjoyed the ""make your own salads"" options for lunch in the pool atrium; all the ingredients were fresh and greens were perfectly crisp. for dinners I was able to enjoy the tasting menu as well as a la cart options. The tasting menu was perfectly paced and portioned so it did not leave me feeling gut wrenching full. The menu took you on a cultural journey with berber salads and tagines however the chef took these traditional dishes and added some modern techniques which was quite fun and delicious! Oh and the wine list is pretty good try the local Medallion Rose ;)    The Spa  Go and indulge...the hammam (sitting in a room filled with hot steam followed by washing and massage) is one of my favorite parts of my trip. The spa facilities were clean and serene. The staff is professional gracious and courteous.    Overall La Sultana (property) meets every expectation and the staff goes above and beyond...for me the perfect place to stay while on vacation!",Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Chicago, Illinois",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MavenMomma

Whoever appreciates the architecture know how the atmosphere and decoration of those clever constructions will be absolutely delighted. The hotel is also perfectly located in the medina and easy to find even by car. The staff is wonderful and very professional. They took care of the full family with a lot of small attentions. You could feel a real and natural pleasure to make our stay as exceptional as possible. Similar to what you would do with your best friends staying at your home.

It was very clean and chambermaids were coming to our room at least 3 times to put roses and candles in our room.

La Sultana Marrakech,morpheus_uk wrote a review Jul 2016,50,Possibly the best hotel we have stayed in. And we've stayed in a lot.,From the moment you arrive you feel as though you're home. If your home is stunningly eye-wateringly detailed with beautiful touches everywhere you turn. I even lay flat on my back to take a photo of a small section of ceiling. The flowers in the water features vases and bowls are lovely touches and show an excellent flair for design.    You will feel pampered from the start. The staff will look after every little detail for you - checking us in for our flight home ensuring our glasses are topped up as required (without being pushy) and bringing a small chair for your handbag should they spy it on the floor. They provided us with an excellent transfer service to and from the airport. Which made things much simpler.    The sunbathing areas both by the main pool the roof-top plunge pool and even the small jacuzzi pools dotted around have the perfect number of sunloungers - enough space between them to make you feel relaxed rather than crowded. Towels and cushions as required. Waiter service is friendly and set at just the right level to make you feel looked after. Complimentary delicacies are brought round from time to time which give you a glimpse of the cuisine.    On the subject of cuisine...... Breakfast is excellent. A very good selection of meats and cheeses pastries - sweet and savoury - cereals juices and a large selection of egg options. Lunch is a very good menu which offers snack-size meals upwards. If you feel like it you can enjoy three courses of excellent food along with a very good selection of wine or just a beer. My husband was a huge fan of the barbecue. The camel is very tasty and should be tried as should the cactus mojito.    The evening meal deserves its own paragraph. Pre-dinner drinks on the terrace. Attentive friendly service. A wonderful position for the sunset watching storks on the minarets and enjoying the swooping swifts as they scramble for whatever insects are in the air is possibly worth the cost of the holiday on its own (though we saw very few insects during the days and evenings - no mosquito issues at all). You will be escorted across the beautifully lit terrace to your table where you will receive after placing your order an amuse bouche just to get those taste buds working. You would then be presented (with a flourish!) with your first course. Should you wish they also provide a choice of two tasting menus. Excellent for introducing you to their menu for later nights. The wines are excellent and very easy to pair with your selection of food. If you can manage to fit in a desert you really should. These are each a work of art both gastronomically and visually. Accompanying your meal is some live music which is delightful. We always thanked the performer as we left as well as the waiting staff. We cannot compare the pricing with other restaurants in Marrakech as we chose to only eat in the hotel however I have seen comments saying that this restaurant is on the pricey side. In our opinion we felt that it was worth every penny and when we return we suspect we would only eat here again.    The spa is well worth a visit and the hammam should be tried to be believed. One of the most thorough scrub-downs I have ever experienced and just ideal for kicking off the holiday. We followed with a massage and facial and left feeling totally relaxed. And clean. So very clean.    Usually I like to get the name of any staff member I feel is over and above the others in an effort to ensure their commitment is recognised. I find it impossible to do in this instance. They are simply all superb. Maids cleaners maintenance gardeners waiting staff front of house....... Without exception.    This hotel is worth visiting for the restaurant alone whether you choose to stay here or not. Arrive in time for the sunset and don't forget to book. We stayed in low season and it was still necessary most nights.    We stayed in the Jaguar Suite and found it to be in an excellent position enjoying two private terrace areas and overlooking the main pool. A large lounge area office area walk-in wardrobe very well appointed bathroom (jacuzzi bath separate rain-shower double basins and well-lit make up table) separate toilet and a very comfortable very large bed. We found the suite to be peaceful. Even late one afternoon when a family with young children were enthusiastically enjoying the pool after we had retired to our room with the windows and doors open.

La Sultana Marrakech,Neville5800 wrote a review Jul 2016,50,Dropped in for cocktails and returned for dinner as well,While staying nearby with my family we had often seen the bright red uniform worn by staff outside the entrance to the hotel waiting for guests to arrive. We decided we would be brave and ask if we could go in for drinks one evening and commit to spending more than usual to see what the hotel was like.  We were made very welcome indeed and shown to the pretty roof terrace where we watched swallows and storks fly over as the sun set and we peeped down at the Saadian Tombs next door.Just lovely sitting among the candles and flowers decorating the terrace. Drinks a fraction dearer than in our 5 star hotel and less than we would pay in a 4 star one in England!  After enjoying the delicious canapes that came with our drinks and meeting some lovely staff we asked for a menu and were surprised at the very reasonable prices (230 dirhams for my enormous seafood and fish Ocean Couscous) considering this is a Luxe Hotel and so we booked a table for the next night.    We returned to enjoy an excellent meal with a good variety of things to choose from we were invited to take a look round the hotel's main rooms which were fascinating with pools and tropical greenery glimpsed through decorated archways. So glad we went in as everyone was very friendly and the hotel inside is as amazing as we hoped it would be.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Swindon, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Neville5800

We were fortunate to spend 5 nights at La Sultana. What an amazing experience. Our riad was beautifully decorated and our room was decadent and lavish. I cannot say enough kind words about the staff. They made us feel like welcomed guests and went above and beyond or expectations. The location in the medina was quiet and relaxing. Most times it seemed as if the entire resort was our alone. To the staff the ladies in the spa to the waiters chefs and front desk staff - thank you.

La Sultana Marrakech,Chandiisthebest wrote a review Jun 2016,50,Magic! Absolute luxury in the heart of Marrkech,No photographs and no words can do justice to this gorgeous riad. La Sultana is by far the most gorgeous place I've ever stayed in - it feels like a fairy tale a magical palace that is also your cozy home. It was an absolute highlight of our travel through Europe and Africa. The location is excellent – you are in the very heart of the medina yet completely quiet private and secluded. The rooms are the work of art; the swimming pool and the spa are breath-takingly beautiful. Their interior design unbelievable with masterfully selected art. The staff - Ilyass Rachida Khalid and Saida treated us like family every minute of the stay. In one of our rooms we had a minor technical glitch that most hotels wouldn't even consider an issue. Folks at La Sultana surprised us with an upgrade to a luxurious two story suite with a balcony and to spare us the inconvenience of moving (!) offered to keep our suitcases in the original room. We were speechless. The only tough part of the stay was that we had to leave… Oh and the food in the restaurant is delectable.

The reality of our 3 day stay certainly met all expectations and more.  La Sultana was one of the stand out experiences of all the luxury hotels we have ever stayed in. It would be one of the main reasons for my return to Morocco. We would love to return!  We particularly enjoyed the beauty of the design and the effort that has gone into detailing to create the most beautiful aesthetic environment- its astounding.  I particularly liked the original riad The Sherazade which is the most African in style.  We stayed in the GIraffe Room which couldnt have been more breathtaking 100% satisfyed !  My spa experience was fantastic it is the most beautiful jewel like atmosphere  all mint green and rose pink and to have warm water tipped over your head and body from a beautiful brass bowl was incredibly nuturing. Put me off going to other hammams as I didnt think it got any better than this!  We dined by the pool each night serenaded by fabulous music the food was of fine dining standard the chef excellent.  My only suggestion was the quality of the cooked foods at breakfast time didn't quite match the standard of the rest of the experience.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Auckland Region, New Zealand",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/margaret826

However once you enter you immediatelly forget buzz and noise of Medinas street. An oppulent elegantly constructed property will suddenly welcome you. Hotel is composed of 4 former riads each decorated in a different decor. I preferred a white marbled riad with yacuzzi in the middle. Swimming pool is well accessible though it is not a complete outdoor pool so if you are after some sun bathing you will need use roof top terrace.

La Sultana Marrakech,Gabrielle U wrote a review Apr 2016,50,Best of Both Worlds,I recently stayed at La Sultana in Marrakech during a trip through Morocco. I had been to the northern part of the country and stayed in a small riad (almost like a Moroccan bed and breakfast). I was excited to return and bring my father to see Morocco.    La Sultana was the perfect hotel because it is built of 5 riads connected together to form a complete hotel. Thus the hotel maintains a quaint and boutique feeling but is still large enough to accommodate the luxuries of a larger hotel.    Some particular highlights were the stunning views of the courtyard from my room Le Fennec; cocktails on the rooftop overlooking the city; and the restaurant! The food was absolutely delicious and although I usually venture out of the hotel when traveling to eat and experience new things I was overwhelmingly happy that we chose to eat at the restaurant our first night.    The staff is incredibly helpful attentive and pleasant. All of our needs were met immediately. In particular Ilyass at the front desk was exceptionally welcoming. He showed us to our rooms stayed to make sure we knew how to work everything inside recommended fantastic dining experiences and offered to make us reservations all before we had even unpacked. He truly made our stay even more special.    I highly recommend La Sultana if you are staying in Marrakech and want a comfortable well-located and beautifully designed place to stay.,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gabrielleu1625

We were welcomed by one of the staff who escorted us through the hotel into the spa area. This was a beautiful marble setting you felt relaxed straight away.  The traditional hammam involved first being in a marble room the ladies wash your body with lovely warm water and black soap you do end up naked but it's a natural experience so don't feel embarrassed after the wash you're taken to a second marble room where you are given a body scrub I also opted for the clay wrap. You are then thoroughly washed again before being led to the relaxation area which is tranquil and beautiful. The treatment lasted around 45 minutes and you are left glowing and feeling amazing.  I then had a back massage which again was amazing my friend had a deep tissue massage which she also said was perfect.  We then relaxed by the Jacuzzi for an hour to wind down with mint tea.  This was truly a lovely relaxing experience. We both felt wonderful afterwards and left with glowing skin feeling thoroughly rejuvenated.  Following the spa we visited the roof top terrace for lunch again this was delightful. The setting is beautiful. I had a Mediterranean salad which was perfect my friend opted for the vegetable tart also lovely.

La Sultana Marrakech,Melanie Martins wrote a review Apr 2016,50,A Magical Experience in the heart of the Medina!,If you want a truly authentic experience then don't look further: La Sutana is definitely what you are looking for! All the main attraction of Marrakech are within walking distance from La Sultana.    When we arrived in the evening we didn't know what to expect to be honest: it was in the middle of the Medina and we had to go from the main door walk thru the outdoor patio enlighten by candles and then get into a second door to arrive at the reception. It was like a secret place a mystery.    Once we entered in the lobby we understood immediately how magical this place was! We got welcomed with traditional mint tea and pastry front of a very cozy fireplace.  The manager welcomed us and gave us a complete tour of the Hotel that was really much bigger than we thought! The Hotel has 5 Riads each one has a different style and different story. We went to the African styled Riad and got a beautiful suite in tones of black white and gold with high vaulted ceilings decorated in precious woods marble and copper and littered with paintings and objets d’arts.    The Spa is definitely a must try as you have the best masseuse in town a fantastic Jacuzzi and 2 traditional hammams. Since I staid only 1 night I had time to do only the massage but it totally worth it as she was definitely amazing!  We had dinner at the restaurant near the pool with live traditional Moroccan music that turned the entire environment so magical full of candles and exoticism.  The food was really tasty although I had a very light meal (as I ate too much pastries during the day).    The next morning we had our breakfast at the rooftop terrace with the magical views of the Royal Palace the Koutoubia Mosque and the snow-capped Atlas Mountains in the distance! Was really impressive!    For lunch we got fish at the terrace since the weather was really sunny and warm. We felt definitely relaxed distressed and... in holidays!    1 day was definitely not enough to enjoy at the fullest this incredible and memorable place!

La Sultana Marrakech,Stags00 wrote a review Apr 2016,20,"Pretty Hotel, but not worth the stay","We were very much looking forward to this hotel based on all the wonderful reviews found during our search. We had booked our visit to Morocco and chose this hotel as the last stop and a nice way to end our honeymoon which brought us to other great hotels around the world. Sadly our vision of this hotel did not live up to the expectations we had based on other reviews. This being the 3rd hotel in our trip all of which were ""5 stars"" but this by far was not a 5 star hotel in comparison to the others. The riads are very beautiful there is no question about it. They have done an amazing job restoring and creating a small oasis from the chaos outside. Every picture taken is beautiful but this is where it ends. It's the service side of things where this hotel falls very short based on our experience. First of the other hotels we stayed at during this trip this was the only hotel not not acknowledge our special occasion. We weren't expecting a grand gesture by any means but at the other hotels both left a hand written note congratulating us and thanking us for staying with them. It's these small things that great hotels from average. Upon entering our room everything seems normal for awhile but then the smell of sewer started seeping into our room from the bathroom. We aren't the type to complain and we understand that the infrastructure of the city isn't always going to be modern so we dealt with the smell for the duration of our stay. But its hard to understand why the hotel wouldn't do a little more to alleviate this issue as it prides itself on being a premier boutique hotel and we couldn't have been the 1st to experience this issue. We felt like second class quickly upon our arrival. Its hard to figure out why other than our age and/or our nationality had something to do with it. We had nothing to deserve this as we are both quiet people and never complain and roll with whatever comes our way. It is unfortunate to have to write this as we have been all over the world and haven't experienced this issue before. My comment is based on how we observed others being treated in comparisons to ourselves. I guess this is why there are so many good reviews but we did not experience these first hand. After a day long discussion we decided that this hotel wasn't worth trying to make the best of it anymore and decided to check out a day early losing out on a nights stay and spending even more to change airfare.    This might be a premier boutique hotel but its far from it in comparison to others around the world.",Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Stamford, Connecticut",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stags00
La Sultana Marrakech,HATE2WRK wrote a review Mar 2016,30,IF YOU DON'T SPEAK FRENCH OR ARE AN AMERICAN DON'T BOTHER.,Hotel staff was more favorable to the French. Oh and if you are Arabic speaking I wouldn't say you are from any Gulf countries either like Kuwait etc. Apparently they don't like them either.    A few instances with hotel staff which made them aloof to the fact we chose to stay at this particular Riad:    First night we had dinner there the main guy or I guess you could say more like manager dude (only guy wearing a black suit) was less than impressed he had to wait on us. As we walked up he was arguing with what appeared to be another patron not really sure as it was in French. Mind you we had been traveling all day and were exhausted. He didn't smile wasn't friendly and didn't really seem to have wanted us at his table. However when the British came to sit at a table next to ours his tune changed. Maybe because they were not American??? This was a common theme in Morocco.    The cooking class we paid a nice chunk of change to make our own food had a rude and downright just pissy instructor if that's what you want to call her. She never introduced herself never smiled nothing. We started the cooking class in silence with her pointing at objects to cut wash etc. And I told her I spoke a little Arabic and she still was pissy. My husband and I never felt more uninvited than we did then in that hotel. Luckily it was our last day. We ended the cooking class also in silence as she never said thank you which she could have said in French which she didn't or Arabic but that was too much trouble for her. You don't have to speak any language to know when people are rude. My advice is pay extra and go somewhere else with a few more options/ activities just in case it does rain and you are stuck inside at the mercy of the hotel and is overall bigger in nature. We kept seeing the same staff everywhere as they did multiple jobs at our Riad and maybe somewhere else like the Four Season's you won't have to go through what we did.    Finally in addition to the hotel Morocco is one of those places I will never go back.

We spotted their rooftop restaurant when we were visiting the Saadian tombs (actually how we found most of our restaurants in Marrakech so do take the time to look up wherever you go!) thought it looked like a delightful spot and returned for lunch a few days later. We were not disappointed; from the moment we stepped through the door (and even the approach to the door is beautiful with really interesting brickwork) we were made to feel very welcome by the wonderful staff. Our lunch was delicious and the service excellent including bringing me a pretty miniature chair for my handbag so it didn't need to go on the floor. We had to walk through quite a lot of the hotel to reach the terrace and I must say it looks stunning with a gorgeous pool area - completely deserted during our visit.    It's in a great location not too far from the chaos of Jemaa el Fna but far enough to feel like a world apart. And judging by our meal the welcome we received and what we saw of the property I can only imagine the rooms are lovely. It's a member of the Small Leading Hotels of the World group a handful of which I've stayed in all of them excellent. We actually preferred the atmosphere of La Sultana to that at La Mamounia which we also visited for drinks. La Sultana is now top of my list of places to consider staying if I return.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UKLizzie
La Sultana Marrakech,Drpaulbt wrote a review Mar 2016,50,Exquisite riad/rooftop/superb service in Marrakech,My friends and I have traveled quite extensively and we have stayed at high end small boutique hotels. We all felt this riad was probably the most beautiful and exquisite place we experienced. The riad is in an excellent location to the medina for easy access yet close enough to the outside.  The facility was beautifully decorated and the service impeccable. Ellias at the desk (and all the staff) went above their duties to make sure our stay was memorable.  When we return we will definitely stay at this facility and will recommend it to all of our friends.  FYI the restaurant is excellent and unfortunately we tried a local hamam but wish we had used the riad's amenities.

La Sultana Marrakech,NYCmid30s wrote a review Feb 2016,50,Great little boutiquey Hotel,This is a great place to stay. They'll pick you up from the airport and take you into the city - nice quick 10 min transfer too. When we got dropped off we were pretty confused as it looked like we had been dropped off not by a hotel which was a little disturbing however the hotel is down a short alley so fear not.    The staff were fantastic service was of the very highest level. The hotel is a combo of 5 old house and each open out into their own little courtyard and all have their own feel to them. No reason to pick one over the other but it's lovely to explore all the different sections and their different feelings. The hotel itself has a lovely feel - not very big and just has an intimate feel to it and wonderfully situated to wander around from if you choose to.    The room was superb beautifully decorated and very comfortable. Fantastic blackout shades which reduced light to virtually zero and muffled sound so we were able to sleep late on a couple of occasions with no issues.    The pool is a fantastic place to just relax at after a day of exploration and the staff will bring you whatever food or drink you ask for. The hotel also has a beautiful open air restaurant on the roof with panoramic view of the city. Eating there one evening was one of the highlights of our trip - fantastic local food available there too.,Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NYCmid30s

This place is like walking into every old movie you're ever seen that painted exotic visions of old Marrakesh complete eye-candy with every detail picture perfect and you can touch it and live in it during your stay! The staff were incredibly nice and helpful and went out of there way to assist use when we had trouble with our luggage drop off. The restaurant was also fantastic the service was amazing my friend has Celiac's disease and is allergic to dairy the minute we mentioned this the waiter said no problem brought out Gluten Free Bread and walked her through all the items on the menu that met her diet restrictions as well as pointed out which items could be modified. I've been to 49 countries and eaten a lot of incredible meals and between the ambiance the service and the incredible food (the homemade Foie Gras was soooooo good!) the dinner we had at La Saltana makes my 'top 5 best meals' ever list.

La Sultana Marrakech,MartineDavis wrote a review Jan 2016,30,Disappointed,I was very much looking forward to our stay here. It was our 12th or so visit to Marrakech. It was expensive but I thought would be worth it.    On a plus note staff and service excellent. The food was very good.    The not so good...    My room was a shoe box. No windows or balcony which from the website is very much insinuated and would be included with a view to the outside. If my room is bad it ruins my trip and it did. The room was smaller than the one I had in the first small Riad I stayed in Marrakech years ago and less palatial. It had pointless artefacts that overcrowded an already small room.    La sultana gives the description of a newly built hotel with a Riad feel and very luxurious. I disagree. I have previously stayed at Villa des Orangers and was hoping for a similar if not more luxe version. The website shows what looks like an outdoor pool area. It is in fact ground level inside and the open air section covered with plastic. Never have I seen this and it's not nice. So I had to sunbathe on roof swim on ground floor. If I had know I would never had stayed. Very misleading website.

And my heart was warmed at every moment I had contact with a member of staff by the incredible kindness and hospitality of the staff. I cannot imagine a more beautiful place to have stayed in Marrakesh..one of the very many charms of this place is that you have all the luxury and benefits of the large five star hotels without being out of the city center you are five minutes walking to the souks  but above all the hotel itself is a jewel and the staff are its diamonds. WOnderful place- especially my great compliments to the majestic Madame Saida who I would consider the Queen of this palace  what a beautiful heart and a fine sense of wisdom and kindness with others after her how to begin? So many lovely people working at the hotel..I will always remember Yassine at the bar what a charming angel of a person. He was so kind with us..also Hannan(?) in the Hamman? A beautifl angel who treated me as if I were her own child during my spa time and brought me back to joy in a moment when I had much stress...all the ladies of the Hamman are wonderful Madame Rashaida (?)

The slightly heated pool is great for refreshing and cooling down after a long day visiting the Souks (markets) and sharing time with local people in Jemaa El Fna the main plaza.    My room was one of the least expensive if not the least but it was roomy wonderfully appointed and decorated. My bathroom was out of the One Thousand and One Nights... with a great bath tub that topped off the rest of the decoration. Loved the ""Birds"" courtyard where my room was found.

In my view this was the best possible arrival experience to enter the magic of ""Marrakesh"".    The hotel is part of Small Luxury Hotels of the World and it is truly a small luxury hotel.    The design of the hotel is towards the many indoor courtyards as the majority of the houses in this city. The roof top terrace has a wonderful view on the city and many minarets; this is the perfect location for a spectacular breakfast.    My recommendation is to pay attention when you reserve your room to ask for a room on high floor with a view.

La Sultana Marrakech,Danishspecial wrote a review Nov 2015,50,Its worth every $,Yes its not cheap but are you really looking for cheap or you rather stay and feel like a Sultan.  The place is the result of connecting 4 old riad's each one with a different style. So of course all rooms are different giving a unique exclusivity feeling to all guests.  Their location its unbeatable because its in walking distance to medina you can actually see the Saddian Tombs from the hotel (they are wall to wall with the hotel).  Food its probably the best I had in all our trip. (and we where everywhere)  Last service and staff what can I say the are the sultana they are the reason you sit down and write a review.

Just a few yards from the busy Rue de la Kasbah you enter into an oasis of calm from the ‘hustle and bustle’ that is the Marrakech Medina!  We were greeted on our arrival by Hassan who showed us to the roof-top terrace for mint tea and Moroccan pastries gave us an overview of Marrakech and a tour of the hotel before showing us to our room. There are amazing views from the panoramic terraces which overlook the Saadian Tombs.  The hotel is well appointed in traditional Riad style with rooms facing onto central courtyards. Each area had its own design and furnishing theme and we were impressed by the architecture and attention to detail We had a ground floor Prestige room which was very well appointed and spacious with a great sunken bath!  The service in all areas of the hotel from reception to restaurants was outstanding. We were always addressed by name in the restaurant and by the reception staff. All the staff were very attentive and pro-active anticipating your every need but in a calm understated manner.  Hassan arranged for us to have a guide to show us around the Medina for our first morning which provided the ideal introduction and orientation. He also arranged for a full day’s private tour to the High Atlas mountains which was outstanding great scenery and a further insight into Moroccan life history and the Berbers.

On entering the Riad you know it is a special place with beautifully decorated rooms throughout. Being in the Old Town it is within easy walking distance to the Souq and the vibrant Djemaa el Fna. On our next trip to Morocco we will certainly come back to La Sultana. Don't forget to have the traditional Hamman in the Wellness Room,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sydney, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/intrepidgranny
La Sultana Marrakech,Michael R wrote a review Oct 2015,50,A Riad worthy of magical Marrakesh,Everything you've heard and wondered about the magic of Marrakesh is true: it is a unique city with a magic all its own. And in la Sultana there is a riad worthy of the city in every way. You enter trhough a narrow alley at the edge of old Marrakesh. And what you find on entering is an Arabian night's dream of what elegance is all about...and it is done entirely tastefully: consider it a definition of opulent indulgence. Ubderstand that as in any riad your room or suite will have no windows to the outside: all is inner-directed to quiet courtyards each having a different theme. An excellent swimming pool a spa area and a lovely roof-garden which doubles as a restaurant when the weather permits completethe picture. And yes the restaurant is outstanding andf the staff helpful and friendly. So if you want to spoil hyourself in Marrakesh this is hte place.,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelr449
La Sultana Marrakech,Louse9 wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Wonderful hotel,We stayed in here for a week. I've never known such attention to detail and eagerness to please their guests. From the minute our driver collected us from the airport it was 5 star treatment all the way. No hanging around reception waiting to be seen or checked in. We were ushered into a beautiful riad and served mint tea while the luggage was being taken to our room and all the boring formalities were being taken care of. I would highly recommend going for a Hamman and massage in the lovely spa.,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Louse9
La Sultana Marrakech,Robert B wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Fabulous Stay,We stayed at La Sultana for 6 nights in late September of 2015. As you enter the Hotel through the beautifully carved doors you realize that this is a special place.The Hotel itself is a beautiful Riad with finishings and artwork that reflect the atmosphere of Morocco. It is located in the old Kasbah and everything is within walking distance if not the friendly staff will assist in any way they can to procure transportation for you.    Speaking of the staff we have traveled the world and we both agreed that this was one of the best service we have ever experienced everyone in the Hotel was super friendly and helpful in any way. Special mention goes to Azis (spelling?) Maitre D of the restaurant who made us feel special every time. Food by the way is fantastic The menu offers something for everyone's taste western cuisine as well as traditional moroccan cuisine.    The front Desk Staff Hassan and all others whose name I don't remember where so professional and incredibly helpful in making all kind of reservations excursions and other questions we may have had.

Reception then asked if we would like to take a drink on the roof terrace once we had made the reservation which we jumped at the chance to do. Great views over the city lovely wine and great canapés.  Dinner was an experience around the pool area food was plentiful and very fresh. Prices were at the higher end of the price range but was well worth it.  Bizarrely they asked where we were staying and took our room information despite us telling them we had booked a taxi to get us back there.  We comment on their feedback card which they presented us and they were very keen to understand why we had written what we had.

La Sultana Marrakech,Eli092011 wrote a review Oct 2015,50,La Sultana – a place which makes you feel like royalty,A tranquil most beautiful oasis in the midst of the noisy medina. The hotel consists of 5 different riads so you won’t get the feeling of being in a large hotel. All rooms are individually decorated and the staff go by their names „leopard“ or „pure blood“ instead of their numbers.    The staff is exceptionally attentive knowing all guests’ names by heart helping out with guided tours or other activities and making restaurant reservations. Even the daily newspaper has your own name printed on it! But most of all they show great interest in you as a guest and treat you like royalty.    Since you're in the middle of the medina and the hight of buildings is limited don't expect great views from your room. Most rooms seem to have windows or a balcony towards the inner courtyard so will be a bit on the dark side. However this guarantees you cooler temperatures which you will be grateful for!    The absolute highlights of the hotel are its rooftop terrace with fantastic views for breakfast lunch and dinner  its pool area surrounded by columns which also serves as a dining-room when it’s too hot or too cold up on the terrace and last but not least their hammam. If you choose to go to the hammam as a couple no problem there will be two ladies scrubbing both of you at the same time!    The next time we go to Marrakech we will certainly choose the Sultana again – can’t imagine a better hotel in Marrakech.,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Morschach, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eli092011

La Sultana Marrakech,JohnMorgan wrote a review Sep 2015,40,A very quirky hotel with some excellent staff,The whole experience is very relaxing so much so you need great motivation to leave and go exploring.    The best is the roof terrance by day a relaxing place to sunbathe drink and have lunch by night a wonderful open air restaurant. Both experiences heighten end by a couple of wonderful characters serving you with a smile and sense of humour. We also had a few meals by the main pool one especially memorable night wonderful lighting and ambiance.    Food and drink was very good value we did both to excess and concentrated on the Moroccan wine highly recommended and always accompanied by delicious snacks.    The rooms are quirky large and generally without any neighbours. There are numerous casual seating areas dotted around you can always find a quiet corner where you will not be found for hours.    Five star hotels here are not the same level as you will find in the most developed tourist destinations around the globe. This isn't a criticism the standards are still very very high but it's the trade off to be surrounded by such ancient culture and looked after by local staff who can add so much.,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnMorgan1

Everything was beyond our wildest expectations. The rooms were gorgeously decorated the facilities were wonderful and the food at the restaurant was fantastic. We had a room facing a courtyard with a fountain - our room was called The Pelican. Each room has a different theme and décor which made the hotel quite unique.  We also had a chance to try the spa took the exfoliating bath and massage. Everything was wonderful. The only downside was that even though we booked the massage appointment well in advance for 4 people they only had one masseuse. Therefore our friends decided to cancel their massage because they didn't want to wait too long.  The roof terrace was great - we had pre-dinner cocktails there every night with a view of the mosque.

We went to the Jemma al Fna market with a guide (as was suggested) and set up by the hotel - if it is your first time i would highly suggest it. our guide was helpful in showing us the 'quality from the quantity' inside the souks and showed us an amazing time with a VERY good lamb lunch with olives and mint tea - it was an experience not to be missed.

Unfortunately we had the pleasure of staying in this Hotel for one night only but if we ever visit Morocco again we will definitely be back.  The food itself was great you can try everything from Moroccon traditional dishes to international cuisines the wine list was quite extensive for a Hotel quite impressive I have to say.  We enjoyed a couples hammam followed by a relaxing massage (one of the best massages we have ever got) followed by dinner and wine... Paradise.    Tips:  Try their hammam and their massage- you can swim in the pool between or after the sessions.  Make sure you go up the rooftop and have a drink in the moonlight :)  If you are going over the summer they will lay the tables for dinner on the rooftop! Extremely romantic if there are no clouds you can see the top of the Atlas Range!    If it is colder dinner will be served next to the pool still gorgeous.

La Sultana Marrakech,cultofwander wrote a review Jul 2015,50,"Off the hook, truly an awesome experience",I am writing this on my last morning at La Sultana and I mean to tell you that if you are going to visit Marrakesh you must stay here. First off- the staff. I find the Moroccan people in general to be very warm and gracious people- but in the Medina they have an agenda and are pushy about it- they have families so I can't blame them. But when they are not hawking their wares when their livelihood does not depend on you paying the highest price the Moroccan people are gentle and filled with good humor. The staff here exemplifies that taken to the extreme- some parts great hospitality training mixed with those already wonderful traits. We loved Zachary Ayub Beder Hassan Sayid Asmat... All such wonderful examples of not just good service but ability to connect and befriend. Beder was our waiter and was really funny and playful. Ayub and Zachary both possess constant grins as if there is a wonderful secret they want to share but they can't. The food was excellent- I recommend the scallop carpaccio the tomato gazpacho and the carrots that were in the Mediterranean salad were amazing. There is a lute (oud) player every night to accompany dinner on the roof terrace for which they dress it up with carpets and sexy lamps at each table. The spa is gorgeous- you'll feel like royalty. Their massage techniques are different and made me fall asleep- so gentle. The place itself is gorgeous- over the top in some aspects but that is what this place is. The use of color and lighting Induces a sense of wonder and tranquility- the Balinese also possess this ability to light their environments in this way. My now fiancé proposed while we were here- he was going to do it on the 25th in Tangier but this place made him want to do it here. We will definitely be back! One final note- do not go out without a guide. Our guide Mustafa made all the difference in the world. We went out on our own the first day and it was a terrible mistake. Without a guide you will be accosted and won't have a moments peace to take in the wonderful chaos that is Marrakesh. And don't take any carriage rides- most treat those poor horses terribly. The animals here are not cared for. Make sure you take leftovers with you to feed the many stray cats and have small denominations ready for the old ladies who ask for alms. They need help. Our guide said to only give to the elderly- the rest are professionals.,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Los Angeles, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cultofwander
La Sultana Marrakech,Fl01993 wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Perfect stay,Stayed at this hotel during a recent holiday to Morocco. During the ten days we stayed at four lovely riads/ hotels but this was by far the best. The room was beautiful with lovely little touches including complimentary soft drinks and pastries and fruit. The staff were all so helpful and there was always somebody around to assist with anything. The breakfast was wonderful with traditional morracan options plus a selection of egg options which we tried a couple of and they were delicious and set us up for the rest of the day. This hotel is perfect for Marrakech as it offers peace and relaxation in a manic city- it was so tempting to just spend the whole time in the hotel rather than exploring the city! Would recommend this hotel to anybody! Thanks again for a lovely stay.,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Exeter, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fl01993
La Sultana Marrakech,Andre wrote a review Jul 2015,50,"Luxury at its height, Service beyond expectations",On a whim and because of a sudden long weekend I had I decided to fly to Marrakech from Paris. The hotel choice was between a luxury chain international hotel and Le Sultana. I chose the latter and my stay upto now as I write this at Marrakesh International Airport I long to go back to this amazing place. From the initial inquiry on the telephone to the moment they send you off to your vehicle to the airport Le Sultana has perfected the art of luxury service. I was travelling alone and they were there for everything that I needed even before I knew I needed it. I arrived at 8 AM and requested early check in. They offered a fabulous breakfast while I waited where the wait staff (special shout out to Yula! ) were very attentive without being intrusive. I was upgraded from a junior suite to a full suite. The fantastic service is coupled with interiors that is reminiscent of the Golden Era of the Saadien dynasty. From the open air roof top restaurant and cabana bar to the opulent rooms to the pristine pool to the surreal spa this hotel has it all.    I would however like to congratulate Ms Saida Loutou Front desk manager who made my stay all the more memorable because of her warmth genuine concern and unparalleled hospitality. I also say thank you to the wonderful Charles the French intern who I am sure will one day make it big in the hospitality industry.    I had a magical time.

I was greeted with tea in the beautiful garden and went immediately to the spa for hammam and massage. The spa is one of the best ive been at. Our room was beautiful and large and outlets were adequate. We ate dinner one night at the restaurant by the pool. the food was amazing.

La Sultana Marrakech,JerryBl wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Many thanks to all the staff at La Sultana for making our visit so wonderful,La Sultana in Marrakech is the best hotel I have ever stayed in.  The staff were very polite and kind and extremely thoughtful. Little touches like refreshing towels and bottles of cold water given for us to the driver of the private car who met us at the airport made all the difference. When we left they had even filled out the embarcation forms which we needed to present at departures at Marrakech Menara airport.  The hotel itself is a work of art - constructed from five Riads by 420 craftsmen over three years the attention to detail shows everywhere. Each Riad has its own style and it was a great pleasure to explore the hotel.  On arrival there was no hanging about in reception filling in forms - we were taken to a shaded gazebo on the roof with cooling water mist to control the temperature where we were given Moroccan mint tea and pastries. Saiid then took us on a guided tour of the hotel and showed us all five Riads and the extensive facilities offered by this great hotel. We saw the Saadian tombs from the hotel - it is right next door.  Our room was located in the Riad built in the Moroccan style and was wonderful. The air conditioning was effective but quiet. We felt that we were staying in a Moroccan Palace. It was spotlessly clean and the Moroccan tiled bathroom was amazing.  La Sultana is an oasis of calm in bustle and hubbub which is Marrakech. When we left the hotel to explore the city the staff on reception offered us bottles of cold water to take with us. It was only a short walk from the hotel to the Jemaa El Fna square and the entrance to the Souks. We particularly enjoyed our visit to the Majorelle gardens and the Berber museum.  The food at La Sultana is excellent - the scrambled eggs at breakfast were the finest that I have ever eaten and the croissants as good as any I have eaten in France. Lunch is served in the roof restaurant and in the courtyard by the pool and there is a great choice of Moroccan and French dishes and Moroccan and French wine. Dinner is served in the main courtyard on the ground floor and the combination of great architecture and subtle lighting gives a very romantic atmosphere which is enhanced by a musician playing a lute on the other side of the courtyard.  During the day lying by the pool sipping a refreshing gin & tonic I spent a long time examining the details of the building - the amazing brickwork the Morrocan/moorish style ironwork the floor based and hanging lanterns and the details of the ceilings in the covered part of the courtyard.  I had organised our stay at La Sultana as a surprise for Jovie's 60th birthday. I had asked the hotel via email before the trip if they could recommend a local florist so I could get Jovie some flowers. As well as providing the numbers of three florists Ghizlane also told me that La Sultana could also provide the flowers themselves - I chose this option and Jovie was delighted with the arrangement of 60 roses which the hotel provided - I would like to give a big thank-you to the person who created that arrangement.  Many thanks to all the staff at La Sultana for making our visit so wonderful.

La Sultana Marrakech,janejohnson58 wrote a review Jul 2015,50,One Word...INCREDIBLE !,Wow from the moment we were dropped outside with the porter waiting for us in his traditional uniform we knew we had arrived in paradise. The entrance alone is sensational wonderful welcome by the very attentive staff. We had 2 beautiful rooms in a quaint courtyard. The rooms were gorgeous you couldn't want for more the Clarins toiletries in the rooms are a lovely touch. The pool area in wonderful but if there are no sun beds available there is plenty of choice on the roof terrace with a plunge pool to cool down in. We loved the food everything was freshly made and delicious. We will definitely return as this was the most perfect hotel and in a wonderful position my children aged 18&16 loved the trip.

La Sultana Marrakech,The-Wilmerdines wrote a review Jun 2015,50,Wonderful!,Conveniently located next to the Saadian Tombs in the Kasbah area La Sultana is a fantastic hotel tucked away from the madness of the Marrakech streets. The hotel itself is simply stunning comprising of a number of different themed riads all exquisitely furnished and designed. Its like something out of Arabian nights!    The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful - nothing was too much trouble and they always had a smile of their faces despite the fact it was Ramadan and must have been exhausted with the heat!    All the rooms in the hotel are different; we stayed in the koudou room and I cannot fault it. Beautiful furnishings lovely big comfy bed huge bath complimentary soft drinks and welcome Moroccan pastries and fruit.    The facilities were great - nice sized pool given the central location and was very relaxing and peaceful. We ate in the restaurant twice and whilst it was on the pricey side it wasnt unexpected given the quality of the hotel and the food was the best we had in Morocco. Lunches by the pool were also good although huge!    Yes you will find cheaper hotels in Marrakech but you get what you pay for and you will not regret booking La Sultana.

We had a standard but still gorgeous room stocked with Clarins bath products and a mini-bar (an amenity this American appreciated). While at the hotel we spent a lot of our time on the amazingly beautiful rooftop space that is used for reception and meals. It was a great place to unwind with a glass of wine after a busy day exploring Marrakech. We dined there most meals and each was great!

La Sultana Marrakech,OVI H wrote a review Jun 2015,40,Beautiful!!!!,La Sultana lived upto the reviews on the site. for first timers in marrakech we didnt know what to expect and the exterior of the property was not fantastic. However coming into the hotel and doing the check-in was excellent!! The staff were very attentive and realized we were tired and just signed us in and off we went to our room. We stayed in the Jaguar suite and there was nothing to say.. fabulous!!! the bathroom had a jacuzzi and felt like a palace. the roof terrace was wonderful we could have stayed in the hotel indefinitely. Nothing was too much trouble. The service was above and beyond a member of staff saw us on the first afternoon looking lost and ensured even though he was on his way home that we got to the square and that was the gardener!!!    Finally i should say we noticed that there is a sister hotel in qualidia which is on the coast and they transferred our final night to the hotel same standard of room with no additional charge.

Its the finer details that makes this hotel stand out. The furnishings thoughout the hotel & in the rooms (each room is unique) the public spaces you can relax in and lose yourself the poolside complementary treats the 5pm complimentary ""hors d'oeuvres"" the friendly staff and the ""Yes Can"" attitude.

La Sultana Marrakech,nirav01 wrote a review Jun 2015,30,"Lovely Riad, Terrible Food/Service",Booked this Riad after looking at most of the positive reviews. booked for 4 nights HALF BOARD.  Pros: Superb location 5 mins to the main square very quiet place with a nice swimming pool and jacuzzis. Its a small place with just 28 rooms. Rooms are very quiet and are very clean.    Cons. Upon check in we stated that we had half board and that we were Vegetarians and we were assured we would be looked after. Our nightmare at the hotel started the 1st evening where they had made no arrangements and the service was really poor food served cold and small instructions were not followed at all. We gave up with our half board option after that experience and told the manager about it the next morning but instead of helping us and making any arrangements he decided to just give up and cancel our half board option.    We didnt want to spoil our little break so decided to just eat out everyday! Breakfast was also a struggle as nothing was there for us and lived on the cold limited optioned buffet of cereal and bread.    Must admit we were extremely surprised with our experience with the food part so on that part i wouldnt go there again as lots was assured during check in and nothing delivered at check out!,Date of stay: June 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nirav01
La Sultana Marrakech,OntoMyWardrobe wrote a review Jun 2015,50,A palace in the middle of the Kasbah,It was our first time in Morocco first time in Marrakech and nothing could have been more welcoming than La Sultana. The hotel is composed of 5 differently themed beautiful riads courtyards all with relaxing places to sit or tan some with pools or jacuzzi's even. As the riads the rooms are also differently themed and everything inside them is curated to the highest degree I would find it hard to believe someone would be displeased with spending a night in any given room. The rooftop is amazing with yet another jacuzzi tanning beds and a covered space to relax and have a drink. The view is breathtaking from there all around you looking at the streets of the Kasbah in Marrakech. At night the rooftop or the bigger pool's area become a restaurant that is said to be amazing although unfortunately we did not have the time to experience so I can't talk about the food except for the breakfast. The breakfast is amazing the tea is great (better than the coffee if you ask me) fresh selection of an egg dish made on the moment and a buffet of delicacies that will keep you energised for a long day out or satisfied for a relaxing time at the hotel's many spots or spa. The staff was lovely and very helpful always you are really taken care of and can experience a great time of relaxing and enjoying a hotel that is as beautiful as a moroccan palace. For someone looking for a great place to stay in Marrakech this is a thing to see but for someone coming back to Marrakech (something we would like to do soon enough) this hotel is a place you could spend days in and still feel you are in morocco but living in great luxury and peace. Either way the place is amazing and worth a visit.

Best of all were the meals (a stupendous foi gras pastilla) and genuinely helpful staff.

With seven categories of rooms to choose from my husband and I had the pleasure of experiencing the delux suite otherwise known as the Jaguar suite. It is positioned within the courtyard featuring the jewel of La Sultana: the turquoise heated swimming pool within a patio of palm banana and sica trees and high brick walls covered with Virginia creeper to the right and to the left a long corridor of earthy peach archways and enclaves. By day the courtyard is the heart of La Sultana with guests lounging by the ionised pool or enjoying lunch in one of the enclaves.

La Sultana Marrakech,Huw R wrote a review May 2015,50,A truly breathtaking experience,Other reviews have described La Sultana as straight out of Arabian Nights - I fully endorse that. La Sultana is exceptional in every respect. We have enjoyed 5 star luxury hotel all over the world but nothing quite like this. The public areas and every room are superbly restored at a high level of authentic detail. As one walks around one is confronted by yet another stunning vista- and the effect does not wane after several days.  Grand as it is it quickly feels like home - which is mainly due to the staff who really understand service without intrusion. They will gladly engage in conversation about their country and culture - really friendly people - makes a huge difference. Nothing is too much trouble - even the smallest detail gets prompt attention.  The restaurant tasting menu is just a marvel - make sure you are hungry!Again it is matched with top service and details of the local cuisine - first class.  Now the Spa - my wife is not a spa person but this is truly something else - the web photos tell the story - its exquisite.  For reasons not clear to me La Sultana is not the highest on the list of Riads in Marrakesh - in our view it's a clear number one - we will be back soon,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Farnham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/783huwr

Upstairs we had a very comfortable bedroom more seating a large dressing area another seating area / library (as they called it) overlooking the inner courtyard and a side balcony with chairs.  The hotel is made up of five raids all linked. Gorgeous artefacts decor and an abundance of beautiful flowers make this a delightful place to stay.

La Sultana Marrakech,whitecottage1 wrote a review May 2015,50,Straight out of the Arabian Nights,Stayed here for two nights in Feb 2015.  It's right in heart of the Kasbah in heart of the Medina of Marrakech so easy walking distance of everywhere within the old city walls.  However because it is a riad you are cocooned from all the hustle and bustle of the streets - it's all only a few paces from front door but feel like it's miles away.  Hotel is actually 5 riads that have been joined together and meticulously restored by an army of traditional craftsmen in conjunction with the ministry of culture so the interiors are utterly amazing. The attention to detail is incredible with every riad and every room quite different. Like staying in a real palace fit for a sultan and his family/harem/courtiers.  Heated pool gorgeous roof terrace overlooking the city with Atlas Mountains behind beautiful spa very welcoming and attentive staff (everyone from manager to chamber maids was charming) superb food...

La Sultana Marrakech,Jaymie K wrote a review Apr 2015,50,Absolute Perfection!,At the end of a rather hectic back-packing tour we realised we had booked the incorrect hotel location. We turned up at the front desk of the hotel looking less than stellar and rather stressed and Hassan could not help us enough. He transferred our stay to the La Sultana in Marrakech with little issue and a great big smile.    Upon early arrival the next morning the front desk staff ensured our room was readied as quickly as possible we were given delicious mint tea and a tour of the facilities as well as an opportunity to rest on the roof top deck while our room was completed.    Everyone at this hotel (the cleaners the kitchen wait and bar staff the spa staff and front of house personnel) spoke multiple languages were very knowledgable on the facility and imparted plenty of local and world knowledge during our frequent chats.    All of our meals were amazing the spa experience was devine and no matter where we turned there was always a friendly and helpful staff member ready to assist.

La Sultana Marrakech,new_york_city_travel wrote a review Apr 2015,50,True Oasis,Nothing not to like about this hotel and it's staff and decor. Photos do not do it justice. Every room is unique (with serious attention to detail) and the hotel (riad) is actually 5 houses connected together each one nicer than the next. Was our first time in Morocco and they made the transition easy and enjoyable (thank you Saida). They organized guides schedules etc. Also just a few minutes walking to the Souks (although you would never know once you are inside). An oasis in the middle of a pretty incredible city. Nothing against La Mamounia (or Royal Mansour) they are both extremely beautiful and nice but with them being out of the city La Sultana just feels more authentic and genuine.

La Sultana Marrakech,Yvonne H wrote a review Apr 2015,50,Wonderful Marrakech,My sisters and I stayed at La Sultana and were not misled by the photo's on their site...it is an absolutely gorgeous hotel where you feel at home immediately and where you will find all the details for a thousand and one night stay!! The architecture is stunning and although you are in the midst of the kasbah area you experience absolute rest inside these walls.  The very professional staff will and can arrange everything for you and are most friendly:-)  The Spa was my ultimate favorite...a wonderful atmosphere of tranquility. The Hammam treatment is quite the experience and the sultana massage performed by Nema was my absolute number one massage I've had in a very long time!!! The restaurant serves typical moroccan as well as international dishes. The quality is very good and again the ambiance where you enjoy your diner and breakfast are absolutely amazing!! With warm weather the restaurant on the rooftop is a delight too with the sound of the buzz of the people in the streets beneath you and the incidental Mineret chanting makes the oriental experience complete. My favorite waiter is Mahmoud...very professional and sympathetic.

La Sultana Marrakech,marta b wrote a review Apr 2015,50,a perfect stay,I decide to celebrate my birthday in a new place and I chose Marrakesh and La Sultana as the place where to stay.  My experience was excellent!  Not only the location is just 10 min walk from the main square and the spice marketin a lively and colourful casbahbut the hotel itself is a jewel well hidden from the outer world.  You cannot notice the entrance perhaps the reception desk seems at first sight an ordinary onebut once you walk inside....well ...it is just a beautifulpeacefulcolourful clean place!! Roses everywherethe dining place around the swimming pool area so well preparedso well furnished so romantic..and then the terrace that offers a beautiful view of the Medina and a perfect place to dine or just having a drink. The service is very good and the people friendly but discreet what more can I say? I felt like at home with a five stars service! We had the Lion suite that has a nice and big balcony over a riad. It was the perfect place to chill out after a walk in the outer streets. My husband organized for the day of my birthday a beautiful day full of surprise and Kalid at the concierge was the perfect help for everything and was always there whatever we needed. The chef of La Sultana prepared for us a very good and tasty vegan birthday cake that surprised me so much! I could never expect itbeautiful from outside and sooo good! thank you again! You made my day one of the best in my life!! Last but not least: The Spa. We had few treatments thereproducts excellentpeople very well trainedthe Spa itself is something you have to see because is just beautiful!

We have stayed in some incredible places luxurious expensive travels. We lead a simple life at home I drive a Jetta but we travel like movie stars and it's so much fun:) La Sultana has been the most interestingly beautiful place we have ever stayed! The service was top notch. Without any pre-planning they hooked us up with a tour guide who was pursuing his PHD in International Tourism. The restaurant on the roof offered the most romantic dinner we have ever had. The setting the music the architecture. Each section of the hotel offers extremely intricate filigree and architecture from the different periods of Moroccan history. The ""secret"" gem is the spa pool underneath the property. We still fantasize about having that secretly under our house. La Sultana was the first place we stayed in Morocco and we immediately were taken in by its grace beauty and accessibility to Americans. We felt safe and were pampered as if we were the only guests. My review does not do justice to all that La Sultana had to offer for a truly 5 Star original and truly Moroccan experience.

La Sultana Marrakech,KTJacoby wrote a review Apr 2015,50,Intimate Authenticity and Luxury in Marrakech,La Sultana is an elegant way to experience the soul of Marrakech. My husband and I were traveling with our 7 year old son and we spent 3 nights at La Sultana.    Arrival: Seamless - one of the highlights of our entire trip in fact. We were greeted right outside customs and whisked away on a rainy evening to the Casbah section of the Medina escorted off the street under a hotel umbrella to the tucked-back main entrance of the Riad. Through the noble entrance way and around a peaceful central garden we were nestled into a luxurious chamber. Crackling smoky fireplace dramatic pours of our fist sips of mint tea and a tower of sumptuous Moroccan pastries this was the best hotel check-in experience I can remember.    Food: We're in the restaurant business and food/dining is incredibly important to us. The setting in the restaurant for dinner is romantic and serene with transporting live music from a single musician. The food was traditional: super clean and very well prepared. We are vegetarian and we found a nice amount of variety. The Moroccan Salads are beautiful including some of the best olives we've ever eaten. The same space is bright and inviting for breakfast. Service here and at the upper rooftop bar was excellent with a wonderful wine list local beers and spirits.    Spa: The Royal Hammam was an refreshing new experience. The space is relaxing professional and clean. The staff is also very professional pampering and discrete. The products (eucalyptus rose anise) all made for an intoxicating sensory experience.    Service/Concierge: From knowing our names and remembering our wine selections to coordinating with our tour to the Ouzoud Falls we got the sense the staff truly cared about us having a personalized and enjoyable experience. They are proud of the unique experience they offer and eager to impress.    Location: While the hotel itself is quiet and peaceful the streets outside offer the vibrant hustle and bustle of the medina. You're a short drive from the airport very conveniently located between the 2 royal palaces just about 10 minutes walk to the jemaa el fna. It's easy to catch a taxi to any other parts of the down town area or to head our of Marrakech (Ouxoud Essouria etc.) for a day trip.

La Sultana Marrakech,Eli G wrote a review Apr 2015,50,The BEST hotel in Marrakech,My husband and I just got back from an amazing week at La Sultana in Marrakech. We live in Manhattan and travel quite often. Our hotel preference is usually the Aman resorts Four Seasons Ritz Carlton and the SoHo houses. In Marrakech La Sultana will definitely be added to this list. The hotel is out of a post card. Every corner is designed with amazing decor.The service is outstanding and consistent. Very personalized and attentive- at ALL times. A small story to share was that one night we got charged almost double for a cab ride that was a 5 minute drive (being tourists the taxi driver took advantage of us). We made a very casual comment to the front desk attendant about this taxi experience. The next day they had an envelope with the extra cash that we paid the taxi driver. They contacted the company and demanded that we get our money back. The location of the hotel is also very good. You are very closed to the main square and souks but not in the crazy part of town.

La Sultana Marrakech,JMC77 wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Simply Incredible,Where to begin with La Sultana? Out of our entire 20 day vacation in Egypt and Morocco this place was our favorite by far; and this includes stays at places like the Four Seasons in Cairo Riad Fes in Fes and the Fairmont in Cairo. There are numerous reasons why this place was the best but the biggest one for us was the service. To give you a perfect example of the level of service while touring one day I was struck by a motorcyclist coming around a blind curve. I was barely able to walk for a few hours but after our guide phoned the hotel about the accident Saida the property manager of La Sultana leapt into action by going to a nearby pharmacy purchasing alcohol and cotton swabs to clean the wound as well as arnica gel for the swelling and proceeded to treat me as if I was her own child. In fact as she was treating my wounds she stated that we weren't just guests we were family. It definitely makes you feel special and not just another hotel guest.  So in addition to the incredible level of service there were the facilities themselves which were amazingly opulent. From the exquisitely carved walls and doors to the beautiful fixtures no detail was overlooked. And despite the opulence of the facilities it still managed to feel warm and homey. We also highly recommend dinner by the pool on your first night in town. It's a great way to ease into Moroccan cooking and not have to worry about getting lost in the Medina on your first day there.  This place truly is an oasis among the craziness of the medina. It was remarkable that once you stepped into La Sultana you ceased hearing the honking horns of cars speeding motorcycles and loud merchants hawking their wares and were seemingly transported to a quiet little paradise.  There are undoubtedly a number of great places to stay in Marrakech and while planning our trip we were deciding between a few but if you're wanting a cozy more personalized experience I believe La Sultana is the way to go. We really can't recommend this place enough. We've been lucky enough to stay at some amazing places around the world but La Sultana is definitely in our top 3.  Thank you Saida and the rest of the staff of La Sultana for an incredible experience. We hope to be back one day.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Austin, TX",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMC77

La Sultana Marrakech,Roger P wrote a review Mar 2015,50,The best hotel we've ever stayed in by a long way.,"From the moment we arrived at La Sultana we were so well looked after by the staff that it was wonderful. We stayed for 7 nights and during that time we experienced the utmost friendliness charm efficiency professionalism and ""unstuffiness"" from every member of staff with whom we dealt. We had reserved a suite and were upgraded to a deluxe suite which was simply stunning.  Breakfast was an absolute delight with the most gorgeous selection of cereals home made yoghurts fresh fruit breads etc. taken on the terrace upstairs looking out over the snowcapped Atlas Mountains. Lunch again on the terrace was excellent - although we couldn't manage both lunch and dinner on the same day because the portions are so generous!! Dinner was served around the pool lit by candles to the sound of a local musician - simply wonderful setting and beautifully prepared and served food.  The Spa is probably the finest we've ever experienced. We went twice during our week for a Hamman and then a massage - you sleep like a baby afterwards.  La Sultana has 28 rooms/suites and this means that guests can be given individual attention but at the same time the hotel is large enough to have all the facilities of a much larger establishment. I would highly recommend La Sultana. It is completely magical. At how many hotels have you been to that the front desk staff give you a hug and shed a tear when you leave?

La Sultana Marrakech,Austin A wrote a review Mar 2015,50,The most exquisite memory of Marrakech - we will return,Scheherazade had one more beautiful story to tell to defer death on the 1001st night and that tale would have recounted the delights of La Sultana. My designer wife and I spend a lot of time scrutinising the best boutique hotels round the world for our visits and are very demanding with regards to service food and aesthetics. The riad/hotel surpassed our very highest expectations - I would like to name a few staff but there are many that helped us feel at home: Khalid Hassan Mahmoud and Afid.    The key to a perfect welcome for a guest is the very first impression and the impressive entrance and traditional carpets flanked by lanterns teased our imagination from the very beginning. The front office staff immediately ushered us into a separate and cosy anteroom with mint tea and traditional sweet pastries while they made the perfunctory checks on our passports and hence causing the least possible distress. The meal by the pool on our first night was both impressive and evocative of the great berber traditions that founded the town while retaining an air of sophistication and our waitress was extremely sweet and helpful.    We have had constructive discussions with La Sultana regarding our first room which lacked a little bit of the joy and beautiful colour which characterises the rest of the hotel (though clean and good amenities) but our next suite was quite simply one of the most beautiful and thoughtfully decorated rooms we have ever stayed in. The Elephant room reflects the majesty and size of the animal yet softened by the luxurious fabrics crystal handles and bespoke furniture.    At every turn through the multitude of communal rooms there were details that left us spellbound and anxious like a small child for more treats! The roof terrace overlooked both historical features such as the Saadian tombs but also the raw energy of the market place and the day to day life in the medina. Drinks and breakfast were drawn out and infused us with a sense of complete well being. The cookery course is an absolutely essential and fabulous experience under the tutelage of the chef in a separate area with a full array of new and clean kitchen paraphernalia and the chicken tagine with preserved lemon and aubergine salad we created was a triumphant conclusion!    Please believe me as i have researched thoroughly riads and hotels in Marrakech that you cannot find a better place to stay in terms of location authentic impression of the culture and sheer luxury and indulgence with service to match.

Chose the hotel from photos in Riads of Marrakech book and reviews. This hotel is not for people who like minimalism- it is quite stuffy and full of antiques maybe just a bit much. I hate to be critical because the hotel offers very warm service and has a lovely roof top terrace right next to the Saadian tombs and great location.  Stayed in the zebra room- fittings are a bit old-fashioned but lovely effect overall.  We appreciated the champagne and nibbles for our anniversary.

In a word: heaven!    Me and my partner joined five days here and everything was absolutely perfect! From the private dinner to the many one we had in the restaurant nearby the amazing pool.    Also if you are in a magic city when you find a place as La Sultana is really hard going outside because everything here is more of what you can expect. Strong of my experience in 5 starts luxury hotel I could say that I've never seen as in La Sultana people so genuine and kind doing their work at their best to create an unforgettable trip for the guests always ready to give you the best smile they have.    The Sultana is not just a riad but thousand places in one an Arabian night dream where each corner bring you in another experience or world: the terrace where you can see Atlas mountain and the sunset of Marrakech or the storks flying around the mosque; the pool where you can have a relaxing and romantic moment enjoying the melodies of a great musician; the hammam where skilful hands will provide to stretch your muscles. Ask and be sure you will have more of what you have request!    The day after in London makes me feel that La Sultana was the best dream I've ever had!

If you want to experience the real Marrakech this hotel is a great place to do it from. Great food great rooms and wonderful spa. Highly recommended.    When you walk outside prepare to have people trying to persuade you to go into their restaurant or tell you you are going the wrong way. Its par for the course. Politely saying no and then ignoring them is the most effective way to deal with it and its not threatening.

Situated in the Medina and next door to the tombs and about a 10/15 walk to the main square.    Nothing is to much trouble for the staff who are friendly and efficient. The roof terrace has views to the Atlas mountains and there is ample room to sunbath. Lunch is served on the terrace and it is worth trying the camel.    Dinner is served around the pool and again is worth every penny.    Our room and bathroom were without fault.

The architecture is absolutely stunning; as we were shown round the hotel at every turn we kept saying 'amazing'. Each riad is in a different style. The rooftop terrace has fantastic views across the city. Breakfast was served by attentive staff who made you feel very welcome. In fact all of the staff were very attentive. The hotel is located about 10 mins walk from the main square down a short alleyway - very easy to find.

La Sultana Marrakech,Hughster wrote a review Feb 2015,50,Like staying in a five-star medieval church,"Just leaving after four nights in the fabulous Jaguar suite at the Sultana. It's five riads connected together to make 28 rooms each with its own unique historical style. Everything is over the top yet never gauche from the wall appliqués of pounded tin to the tasseled cord that drops out of the ceiling and is pulled to activate the in-suite sunken massage tub.    The location is in the heart of the Medina the old city a stone's throw from the Royal Palace. That's good and bad: good because everything is a short walk away bad because you emerge from the utter tranquility and luxury of the Sultana into the chaos of the Ochre City which includes spotters who track where you go and pull stunts like sidle up to you as you're walking around and say ""Hello! I work at your hotel!"" and guide you eventually but inexorably to a carpet store where you are pressed with hot mint tea and shown rug after rug until you either a) invent a pressing appointment; b) fake an allergic reaction; or c) make it very clear by your facial expression that you are onto their game and to quote Patsy on AbFab ""finish the Beaujolais and walk away from it sweetie."" You really really have to watch your step. You're unlikely to get robbed but you're highly likely to get pulled into a buying situation not of your own making. Just smile refuse smile and get out. Unless of course you need a Kilim rug.    The pool at the hotel is small as is the rooftop gym but both are great for quick workouts. The spa is very traditional right down to a cinnamon scrub that from a towering beauty of an aesthetician that made me wonder whether I'd have skin at the other end of it. The full-body sports massage was divine.    The restaurant is top notch. We had dinner there every night and breakfast there every day. Which brings me to the staff. They are among the best group of hotel employees I've ever met. When was the last time you hugged the front desk manager (the wonderful and ebullient Saida) before you left? The roving managers like Said are terrific as well and every waiter or waitress was just a delight. You forget what a huge difference the staff makes in your travel experience but they couldn't do enough. Including I might add have two double espressos with steamed milk ready for us at 3:15 AM for our early departure to the airport. I mean who does that?    I booked this trip through the Small Luxury Hotels of the World program at $500 a night and expected an upgrade from a regular room to a small suite. What we didn't expect was to find ourselves in the $1000 a night Jaguar suite. There was a foyer with its own TV a 22-step staircase up to the living area two balconies an office a walk-in closet a huge sitting area la la la.    Like everyone else who visits I think we made the 10-minute trek on foot to La Mamounia the true grande dame of Moroccan hotels and possibly the best hotel in all of Africa for drinks at the Italian Bar. I have to say though the displays of raw wealth and wealthy inebriation there really put me off and made me and my partner eager to return to the Sultana.

Our experience was one of impecable service truly atmospheric surroundings and excellent food. The staff were attentive and friendly at all times and gave every impression that no request would be too much trouble. At dinner the mix of traditional Morrocan and French cuisine gave a broad choice of dining at reasonable prices given the quality of the hotel. We also experienced the surprise birthday treatment at dinner all the more remarkable given that we had not mentioned it was a special occasion (we can only assume they had worked it out from the passport). The spa is wonderful all the treatments you would expect and genuinely relaxing. La Sultana is well located in the Kasbah area of the Medina immediately next door to the Saadian Tombs and within a short walk of other important sites. Despite being within such a busy district once you pass through the front doors the calm and serenity of the Riads that make up La Sultana takes you back to a world of relaxation and comfort.

La Sultana Marrakech,JohnnoG32 wrote a review Jan 2015,50,The most incredible hotel we have stayed in!,Where do I start? My girlfriend decided to take me away for 4 days for my birthday and the destination was Marrakech. She booked two nights in a junior suite at La Sultana and as soon as we stepped into the arrivals hall everything was perfect. The hotel is literally in the thick of things with the roof terrace of the hotel over looking the most famous attraction in Marrakech Le Tombeaux des saddiens.  The staff at all times were absolutely brilliant nothing too much trouble and the service exceptional. Being used to staying in 5* hotels through work this was up there with the best we have ever experienced!  It was my birthday on Monday and we decided to eat at the hotel restaurant. Blown away is all I can say. Michelin star quality food without the price tag or stuffy service that goes with it. The staff were exceptional as they were the whole trip and the food was to die for! I was then treated to happy birthday in 4 languages by 4 waiters and the in house musician which was a lovely experience despite normally not wanting to be centre of attention. We also received a free dessert for my birthday which was extremely generous.  If you are going to Marrakech spend one night in absolute luxury and give this place a go. Or alternatively book dinner in the restaurant one evening. We spent £120 for two including starters mains cocktails and desserts.  10/10 excellent in every single way!,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Epsom, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnnoG32
La Sultana Marrakech,travlermb wrote a review Jan 2015,20,Not for those travelling solo.....,When traveling solo you are treated different than if as family couple or group. Here I was given THE WORST room. It was the only room on the ground floor next to the swimming pool/dining area. The room opens directly into the dining area. When I checked in I was shown the elevator to the roof and my room - apparently this is a historic building but I was not shown any of it. There was an annoying vibration coming from somewhere when I asked about it no one else could hear it except the young mechanic nothing was done. Since room opened to the dining area I was awakened each morning by staff dragging tables and chairs for breakfast service. The restaurant was not bad but not great: lamb couscous was very good beef tagine was very fatty. Be careful ordering. Service for breakfast and dinner was indifferent.

La Sultana Marrakech,Ramon G wrote a review Jan 2015,50,Fabulous oasis and haven of tranquility,This is a really great unusual place right in the middle of what first appears to be a thriving and chaotic market street. The entrance to the hotel is wonderfully hidden and once inside you can begin to explore the hidden charms of these 5 exquisitely refurbished Riads or large once private palaces. I was warmly greeted by Hassan and Saida who ensured throughout the week that I was well looked after. The rooms (there are 28 I think) are exotically decorated and themed. Mine was very spacious well appointed and quiet. I ate many meals in the hotel restaurant and the food was first class as was the service. The roof top garden was a great place to lay down in the sun and relax or eat a meal in the outdoor restaurant (the manager of the restaurants Said will look after you superbly) I also took the cooking class given by a local Dada (Chef) and really enjoyed it and learning about the Moroccan ingredients. Although the hotel is right in the middle of the Kasbah the area is not as intimidating after a few days as on first glance and I was extremely glad I choose La Sultana and experienced a real taste of the local culture.    As an aside and a respite from the hustle and bustle of the Medina I enjoyed outdoor walks and lunch at some of the larger hotels or palaces .....in particular the Sellman Palace (amazing stud farm attached to hotel) was a fabulous day out and La Mamounia had gorgeous gardens. The 4 Season was fun for people watching outdoor by the pool for lunch. I found the much touted gardens of Yves St. Laurent (Jardin Majorelle) a huge disappointment and could not recommend them.,Date of stay: December 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RamonG324
La Sultana Marrakech,Zorro_and_Gatinha wrote a review Jan 2015,50,Absolutely stunning hotel!,"If you are like me you are obsessing over where to stay in Marrakech. The choices are overwhelming and when you start looking at riads in the old city each one seems more spectacular than the last. We book-ended our trip with 3 nights in Marrakech which gave me the opportunity to choose 2 different hotels. Once we decided not to stay out in the Palmeraie that narrowed the possibilities; after much research we decided to spend the first 3 nights at La Sultana and the last 3 nights at La Mamounia so I can give you a decent comparison of those two at least.    La Sultana is quite simply one of the most atmospheric charismatic properties I have ever stayed at. The beauty of this hotel and the design integration of the different riads will knock your socks off. As a result of combining 4 different riads the hotel ends up being a fairly large property and for us this is a huge selling point as some of the riads (we visited Maison MK for example) feel somewhat claustrophobic because of their limited footprint. La Sultana manages to feel both intimate and spacious while exuding an authenticity that we found very compelling; there is nothing ""institutional"" about it.    At La Sultana each riad has a completely different architectural aesthetic and wandering throughout the hotel is an amazing experience. We never tired of it. We stayed in the Lion Suite which is the one with the enormous private porch overlooking one of the courtyards and this room (their largest and therefore the most expensive) is definitely worth the splurge. There are 2 bathrooms (one with rain shower the other with an enormous round jacuzzi tub) a separate sitting room and large bedroom that gives out onto the porch. It is absolutely silent with no noise of any kind if you worry about that kind of thing. The service is exceptional with twice daily maid service and every detail has been thought out. Even all the non-alcoholic drinks in the mini bar are free and the wifi works great    We had breakfast included with our room and this was excellent with a huge selection of pastries/cheeses/ meats plus they would cook eggs and other dishes to order if you wanted something hot. The service is friendly and professional just the way you want it.    If you have gorgeous weather like we had you will want to head up immediately to the roof top which is enormous! It was so much larger than I anticipated with many different areas for lounging sitting enjoying a drink taking in the view of the Atlas mountains or the surrounding neighborhood all with really comfortable cushy furniture. Lunch is served there during the winter months but that is the only meal you can enjoy there at this time of year. Breakfast and dinner are taken on the first floor around the pool and particularly at night it is incredibly atmospheric; the one dinner we had (their Moroccan tasting) was terrific and we really enjoyed the live music.    The location is great because taxis can get right to the little alleyway that leads to the front door unlike many hotels in the heart of the Medina where you are going to be walking and getting really lost. It is a chaotic 10 minute walk to the square through a really busy area without sidewalks and you will feel like you are risking your life each time you cross a street.....but we even got used to this.    If you are on a budget I think you could take the smallest (therefore cheapest) room in this hotel and simply enjoy the many public areas which harbor hidden nooks and spacious alcoves for reading or hanging out not to mention the vast and comfortable space of the roof-top terrace. Unfortunately I didn't see any of the other rooms so can't offer any more specific advice. But if you want to feel like you are in Marrakech this hotel offers an aesthetic immersion that is second to none.",Date of stay: December 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Los Angeles, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zorro_and_Gatinha

Down a very small alley off the busy market street you are greeted by a carpet and lantern lined entry. Impressive doors open to welcome you to the small reception where the staff is waiting to ensure every moment of your stay is faultless. They refer to your room as your home and this is they way they make you feel.    Each room décor reflects that of the Riad ours was an amazing suite called buffalo. With a huge bed on a marble platform fireplace and loft seating area. As well the luxury bathroom and jacuzzi. A paradise - close the doors and forget the world!    Dining in the poolside restaurant for a the taster menu dinner or the roof for lunch are both memorable with traditional and European cuisine choices. The staff again greets you with warm smiles and ensures you are looked after.    The spa is simply the ultimate escape with private/couple rooms and treatments. We went twice it was so amazing. The spa staff like the rest of the hotel are so very kind.    After our short stay we felt like family more than guests and the acts of kindness from the staff will stay with us forever.

La Sultana Marrakech,AlsterHamburg wrote a review Jan 2015,50,This is only a restaurant review: Simply one of the best in the city!,This hotel and restaurant is hidden in the Kasbah of Marrakech. Do not be shocked or afraid of the street! It is completely different to the western world. The easiest way to reach it is to have a driver. Upon arrival you will get guided into the hotel (Riad Dar). Well the welcome was not like expected. One lady was looking into her computer and her colleague was looking a little bit unfriendly at us and it needed 5 minutes to get guided to our table located inside and you already will feel like in a dream of 1001 night. The table was directly at the pool inside ! perfect. This is adventoures and romantic as well for having a dinner. For starters we have ordered lobster with ravioli which was good. Then as a main course we have ordered monkfish. What a pity it came too dry and seemed to be frozen. The bottle of white wine was too warm. After the dessert we have got a questionaire. I have answered it at once and then happens what is very seldom. The manager came and talked to us. He has cancelled that amount for the maincourse. And then his boss was intoduced to us. We were very impressed by this honest interest in guests and their impression. As a result we have returned next day for lunch. Then you will sit outside on the terrace. We have ordered Hamburgers with french fried and Club Sandwich and a bottle of white wine. The wine was served too warm and the Club Sandwich was poor. The french fried were still swimming in oil. The service was perfect like always and because of our complaints we did not need to pay the wine and Club sandwich. After that we got introduced to the lady from the reception and she said sorry that she has not paid enough attention at our arrival. Then we have got shown the Riads (5 Riads in one) which was impressive. But the main result of our visits is that nobody will or need to leave this hotel or especially restaurants who is not really satisfied. But like in general you should inform the staff or management about it.

The restaurant serves delicious authentic Moroccan food or contemporary food with french influences. Sitting around the large pool with soft background live music made for a romantic ambiance. The Highlight was New Year's Eve! We first enjoyed some gourmet amuse bouches and champagne on the top floor listening to a local Moroccan band.

We decided to stay on half board after looking at the choice of menu and also not wanting to stumble our way across Marrakech getting a bit lost after a few drinks. This was a good choice the food was excellent and we have very high standards and regularly eat at Michelin restaurants the setting around the pool was lovely. One thing on the Morroccan food it can be very sweet so suggest you balance it with Western. But you have all the choice here.

La Sultana Marrakech,Jm I wrote a review Dec 2014,50,Brilliant stay !,We have spent a week End of Nov at the super Riad La Sultana. We enjoyed the spotless premisses and the very helpful staff. The bedroom was charming. The courtyard of our Riad (there are 5 Riads total cleverly merged in this hotel) was one of the smallest but the fresh rose buds in the center basin made it a fine almost-private corner. The furniture has been thoroughly chosen in antiques and ethnic styles so that it matches graciously the proportion and history of the buildings in all places of the Hotel. The extremely clean hammam and massage place is run by skilled and trained people. The conceiled equipment equipement for these steam/ bath premissess filtering and cleaning must be brutally efficient as no trace of anything unclean shows anywhwere. Pink marble pillars and all-around bath construction and warm waters can be enjoyed as one of Marrakech's favorite and a worldwide reference. The restaurant is very good and the price is OK. The solo singer with its oud arbi guitar under the the arch of the restaurant and large swimming pool Riad beneficiates from the excellent acoustics and can be heared as he speaks or sings softly during the evening meal. The place is unbeatable. And the merged terraces with view on the surrounding streets the stork nests on the next city ancient gate pillars are the perfect place for a delicious sunbath..or Spa. The staff and management serve you and this hotel clockwork with much skill and dedication. A pleasure all around.

La Sultana Marrakech,travelwords wrote a review Dec 2014,50,The ONLY choice in Marrakech....,Had the pleasure of staying at La Sultana for one week in November and really found it difficult to leave at the end.    My job requires me to travel the world a lot and stay in many hotels - most of them 5 star - so my bench mark is set quite high.  I've also stayed in other 5 star hotels in Marrakech over the past 3 years and for me none of them even come close to how amazing La Sultana is.    The hotel itself is stunning - you need a week just to explore all of its corridors and hidden nooks and crannies - all individually furnished complete with their own stories from history. The rooftop provides some extraordinary views of the atlas mountains and is a great place to watch the sunset with a glass of bubbly (or tea).    The rooms are beautiful all individual in design and extremely spacious with all of the mod cons you expect of a 5 star hotel - wifi plush towels quality linen and cloud like pillows plus they also come with a complimentary mini bar so you always have some cold drinks and water handy (replenished daily).    The food is divine - breakfast served around the pool in a gorgeous setting - a good selection of pastries and also a cooked to order menu to chose from - best Pain au chocolat I've ever had.    The staff are some of the friendliest and most competent hotel staff I've ever come across. Everybody knows your name. They ALWAYS greet you with a smile even if they've already seen you 5 times that day. They ask about your day with genuine interest. Nothing is too hard or too much or impossible. They are all Immaculately presented they look like they love working here so in turn you love being here. They go above and beyond at every request and in my opinion are what sets this hotel apart from the rest. There are too many to name individually as I wouldn't leave a single one out.    The hammam is one of the most beautiful I've seen - you could easily spend an afternoon unwinding and pampering yourself.    Location - you can't beat it. 10 minute walk to Jemaa el fna and surrounded by little streets with cafes and shops selling all sorts of delicacies.

Always being greeted as Mr Kaye ie never forgetting who I am by all the many staff is a touch of class I love. The thing that will stick in my mind (and the stay is not even over yet) is that one morning at breakfast I put my book on the floor. Immediately out of nowhere a baby chair was presented and the book placed on it. That is not just attention to detail but attention to me and one cannot put a price on that. My only complaint is that they do not have a branch in London. This hotel is an oasis and sanctuary from the world outside. Life is too short not to experience this hotel at least once.,Date of stay: December 2014,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/520stuartk

La Sultana Marrakech,Holiday_addict007 wrote a review Dec 2014,50,A little paradise in the madness of Marrakech,We have just got back from a long weekend in marrakech at La Sultana and enjoyed the most magical and romantic stay despite the rain. My boyfriend and I travel quite a lot and we have both said that this hotel stands out for us and we can't wait to go back. The hotel and rooms are stunning the staff fabulous the spa treatments a god send and the tasting menu was delicious. We spent hours wondering around trying to take it all in. Highly recommend to everyone!    Note to hotel: now the weather is much cooler it would of been nicer for the water in the spa to be hotter. But that is my only tiny little criticism - the hotels absolutely wonderful.

La Sultana Marrakech,mike s wrote a review Dec 2014,50,An Impressive Second Visit,I wrote a review in August when I spent time at La Sultana with my family and had a wonderful experience. I visited again in October and the impression remained the same. This time we stayed in a less expensive room but the experience and service was truly outstanding. I would advise guess who book suits try to get one with a terrace or courtyard as this truly opens up the space and improves the experience. I did notice this time that some of the regular rooms were not in ideal locations for example next to the swimming pool and quite public but the suits offer total privacy. Given that it is now winter the upper terrace is seldom open for meals so the dining experience is more limited being by the swimming pool. The views of Marrakech are obviously not part of the dining experience in winter but the pool area is a nice place to dine. Overnight there are plastic covers placed over the Riad open roof areas to protect against rain and this takes away part of the experience but this is just for limited winter months and the covers are removed during the day.  It is worth taking the hotel offered transfer from the Airport to the hotel as Marrakech can be somewhat chaotic. The transfer to the hotel is however quite short.  Overall the hotel is in a league of its own for service and care and we will most definitely return for a third time. Pricy it is but value for money and does give the visitor a safe and luxurious way of experiencing Riad living unique to this part of the world.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikesT6876WM
La Sultana Marrakech,Razman Razali wrote a review Dec 2014,30,Magically Mad Marrakech,La Sultana is (somewhat) an oasis of calm right in the middle of the madness that is Marrakech.    Situated off a small alley the hotel is right in the middle of the medina within the hustle & bustle and just minutes walk away from Jemaa el-Fna ie the main square in old Marrakech.    We stayed in the Jaguar Room (Junior Suite) and it was Moroccan decadence at its best. A little over the top for this reviewer's taste the lavish gold plated everything in the bathroom felt like Tony Montana's personal holiday home but with a tiny shower and tinier separate lavatory. The bedroom & living areas was quite dark with a pretty uncomfortable hard bed.    The lady we initially talked to about improving the room conditions was less than accommodating but after a strong word or 2 with the front desk an extra mattress was provided to make the bed more comfortable and also a pair of bedside lamps. I must note here that Khaled & Hassan were excellent hosts (which cannot be said about the others on duty).    The Spa at the Sultana must have been the worst I have experienced. It really was a chronic waste of time and money.    But having said all that the city does have a magical albeit slightly crazy vibe to it. And i guess La Sultana captures that essence perfectly. It could have been a truly outstanding hotel but sadly falls a bit short.

La Sultana Marrakech,Seas0ndTraveler wrote a review Nov 2014,50,Hammam and Dinner review. Excellent!,Honestly if you are into experiencing the different Riads of Morocco this place is pretty mind blowing. It is four Riad/Dars that are connected each one having a different motif for example one is pretty much all carved plaster. The space is really incredible and whether it's to have a drink hammam dinner or sleep you are on the right track.    My partner and I did hammam with a clay wrap here. The hammam space is also beautiful the hammam itself was okay but it was worth it for the moderate price and experience. We couldn't get a good reference on a local hammam and this seemed to be on par with the other hammam experiences in its price range. Afterwards we decided to have a drink and then decided to have dinner. Luckily they were able to squeeze us in but I'm sure you'd want to make a reservation if possible. During dinner there was a terrific live musician playing acoustic guitar this isn't something I normally care about but the musician was actually great as was our meal - one of our best dinners in Morocco (we did the multi-course Moroccan prix fixe).,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Brooklyn, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seas0ndTraveler

We were told by the staff that this used to be a Saadian Sultan's Kasbah (big house) now a riad/hotel with a restaurant. We came here for dinner. Couldn't have asked for anything more romantic for me and my husband's anniversary! Perfect setting! We got dropped off by a taxi a gentleman was waiting for us outside walked us through a dimly-lit short alley with a red carpet towards the entrance. I was thinking of the movie Aladdin the whole time because I truly felt like (as corny as it sounds) it was ""a whole new world"". They took us to the rooftop for cocktails overlooking one of the mosques. The Saadian sultan's tomb is right behind it - the place is full of history. Then we had dinner downstairs by the pool. It was amazing. Food was excellent - big portion for a fine dining restaurant but didn't cut back on the ingredients. Service was 5-star. They had a gentleman playing a traditional moroccan guitar live; ambiance was wonderful.

Our room was very clean the oversized bed was very comfortable and we couldn't hear any other residents once in the room with the door closed. The staff were fantastic and were always on hand no matter what time of the day to attend to you. The food was of exceptional quality - so much so we didn't eat anywhere else during our stay. We relaxed by the pool which was very peaceful. The spa and the treatments were of the highest standard. We had an amazing time and would not hesitate to visit La Sultana again in the future.

We arrived at night and were welcomed to reception down a small candle lit alleyway - beautiful! Reception staff are forever helpful courteous and desperate to please guiding us with restaurant recommendations and prices for tourist attractions ( they even negotiated the cost of our horse and cart tour of the city wall; we'd have paid double the price had we done it ourselves) our room was clean beautiful in its design and extremely comfortable. The pool is deliciously warm and forever peaceful and staff are more than happy To bring drinks and extra towels should you need them.

We felt like we were in an art gallery at times. I celebrated my birthday at the restaurant on the rooftop terrace and it was a wonderful evening. All the staff in all areas were excellent and couldn't do enough to assist us especially when the air conditioning failed in our room. They quickly moved us to an even better room.

La Sultana Marrakech,Paul D wrote a review Sep 2014,50,A Hidden Paradise!,We stayed at the La Sultana for 4 nights at the start of our holiday in Marrakech a 5 star hotel which is actually a group of Riads. From the moment we were greated by the porters in their splendid livery we were transported from the hussle and bussle of the Medina and swept into a hidden paradise which was certainly full of charm and character. The check-in was very informal and relaxing sipping Mint Tea (the first of many) and eating Morrocan pastries while sitting in the courtyard surrounded by fine art plants and a cooling fountain.  We had booked 2 x Prestige Deluxe rooms and were very pleasantly surprised to find we had been upgraded to Junior Suites. My wife and I were in the Camel Suite whilst our daughters were in the Giraffe Suite. Both suites were very well appointed and spacious the bathrooms were tremendous with huge sunken baths as well as showers. Each room had a number of welcome gifts including Wine a Tagine and various fruits and pastries.  The hotel itself was extremely quite and peaceful the facilities were excellent. The pool was great for a morning dip and the roof-top restaurant was ideal for breakfast. The breakfast itself was very nice some may find the choice a little limited though the quality was exceptional (as was everything at La Sultana).  We spent most of our days in and around the Medina the Souks and the Square (more on that in a separate review).  When returning mid-afternoon after the heat of the Morrocan sun we found out perfectly air-conditioned rooms provided an immediate relief. We would then spend most late afternoons at the roof-top bar sitting under the Pergola sipping cold drinks whilst reading a good book. All the time we were being cooled by water vapour which was raining down from above - very refreshing and much needed in the Marrakech heat.  In the evenings the food and the ambience was wonderful. Service was tremendous lots of little surprises and treats and the food was wonderful. The menu may appear expensive at first glance however the chef will create bespoke dishes for you and all were reasonably priced. This was great for as all 4 of us are vegetarian and we had a great choice as a result of the chefs flexibility. I would certainly recommend the mushroom lasagne as this was the best lasagne i have ever tasted.  Finally i would just say that the service we received was the best we have ever experienced. The front desk staff were always courteous and helpful the room staff were efficicient and kept our rooms wonderfully fresh and clean. and the bar and restuarant staff were extremely accomodating.  I would certainly recommend to anyone that they should stay at the La Sultana as it is without doubt one of the most romantic and authentic small hotels you will ever find.,Date of stay: August 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Leicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V1119RFpauld

Well I was not wrong but then all our expectations have been exceeded. It's not too small but not big either. The hotel has a number of swimming pools around including a jacuzzi and a little one on the roof. The breakfast area on the roof is amazing where they also prepare Barbar Omelet. The location is also very good as it's not too busy and the famous ""Jame'a Al Fana"" is about 10 minutes walk.

La Sultana Marrakech,Daina B wrote a review Aug 2014,50,Could hardly be better,"We spent six nights at the Sultana Hotel in Marrakech and can only say that it was an almost flawless experience... right from beginning to end. The hotel itself is in a perfect location in the old part of the city right on a very bustling street but as a guest you don't notice much of the fuss because upon entering La Sultana you are overtaken by a feeling of tranquility. Sitting in the bar/restaurant of the hotel which is on the roof you have a picturesque view of the near-by mosque the storks the date trees... The hotel has absolutely lovely interiors - air-conditioning (very useful!) a beautiful pool a spa section fresh flowers delivered and placed all around every morning... But the very best thing about La Sultana is the staff - right from the flower deliverer to the porters to the driver to the cleaners to the chef to the waiters to the reception staff... A never-ending flow of always smiling always helpful always interested people who seem to be there right when you need them or even before you know that you need them. I can only think of two things that could have been a bit better - one is the lighting in the room which was a bit too dim (there are no windows towards the street in the rooms) and the second is that I got the impression that some members of the staff did not know English very well which is a bit frustrating for those of us who don't speak French or the local lingo but would like to respond to the friendly staff in a like-wise friendly manner. It's a bit sad when they don't understand your jokes.... Oh and one evening I was served an incredibly sour Mai Tai cocktail on the roof terrace - better order a Casablanca beer or some Maroccan wine instead!

Was slightly worried when we got dropped off right next to a small market stall in the middle of the old town but then spied the valet and found the hotel. For check in they took us straight to the roof terrace serving us mint tea and pastries. This gave us a tour of a huge building that has been refurbished to a stupidly high standard and is even more beautiful than the photos suggest.    The room itself was called Gazelle and was full of characterful touches and was about as luxurious as we could have wanted. The fully marble bathroom was breathtaking.    The service in the hotel was top class and always felt that they were providing a service first and trying to make money second - a huge relief in a city where you feel that you are seen as a walking wallet.

We came with Virgin hip hotels and stayed in the Lion apartment. Mint tea and pastries and cold towels on arrival . Complimentary tagine and bottle of champagne in our room along with another tray of pastries. We ate in the rooftop restaurant on our first night and the service and food were impeccable. We had the tasting menu for approx £46 each and it was London dining standard which was a wonderful surprise. Tonight we are trying the international tasting menu and it is just as good. The local wine well priced and actually much better than anticipated. The levels of service at this hotel are excellent and you feel they really do care and know your name( benefit of a riad as opposed to large hotel) the apartment was very unique and we had a wonderful marble jacuzzi in our room. My only minor complaint would be re the water pressure in the shower but this is a small point and something that many hotels suffer around the world. The pool was a welcome relief and felt chilled. Staff here really care especially the manager and the concierge. I would come back here again minus unappreciative children as this road is very well located.

La Sultana Marrakech,Glenn H wrote a review Jul 2014,50,Queen of the Marrakech Riads,When I think of Morocco I think of tale of adventures like Arabian Nights Aladdin and his Lamp Ali Baba and the 40 thieves. These stories center on a hero and his adventures in the markets of Marrakech saving the damsel in distress or searching for hidden treasure. I found such a treasure in the heart the medina of Marrakech in La Sultana a grand dame of Marrakech’s riads.    My adventure began with my entrance into the Medina which is a UNESCO World Heritage site with a thousand years of history and an amazing true open-air. It is a bustling market even at night as I passed through the winding streets of vendors selling their wares. A sense of adventure quickly sets in as I enter the long corridor with Moroccan lamps along the carpeted walkway leading to La Sultana Marrakech. It is a grand and fitting entrance.  The doorman gives me a friendly greeting welcoming me to La Sultana. It is a bit late when I arrive but the staff has been waiting and provides me with attentive and personalized service making me feel welcomed.    La Sultana is actually comprised of five connecting buildings and has 28 unique and special accommodations from rooms to grand suites to accommodate a family. The five buildings are riads which are traditional Moroccan houses with a central patio and all the windows overlooking the interior rather than the outdoors as in European houses.    The tile wood and metal work in each building are nothing less than functional pieces of art with every inch of this property being a celebration of Moroccan craftsmanship. Each of the five buildings is different so there is a new level of amazement as you explore and enter each building and room.    The buildings are designed with Moorish or Andalusian architectural influences with high vaulted ceilings. The spaces are decorated with precious woods marble and copper and littered with paintings and objets d’arts.    I was in the Pelican suite on the first floor which opened into a beautiful courtyard. I felt that I was staying in someone’s home and not a hotel. Inside my room was absolutely remarkable. It was blue with vaulted ceiling and Moroccan details. What I love about Morocco is the artistic craftsmanship and detail that you find here is like nowhere else in the world. The bed was on an elevated platform and below there was a comfortable sitting area around a fireplace and mantel. The bathroom was elaborate with an artesian shower and deep sunken bath.    Every corner was tastefully decorated with design surprises such as the stained glass window that opened into the courtyard. All of the modern conveniences of a five star hotel were there from the flat screen TV complimentary high speed internet and complimentary soft drinks. After my long trip I was pleased to be greeted with the snack tray and a selection of fruits.    My favorite feature at the property was the rooftop terrace which connects the five roofs of the building into a massive outdoor space with spectacular views of the snow capped Atlas Mountains the vibrant markets below as well as the nearby Royal Palace Koutoubia Mosque and other landmarks. There were large palms and orange trees an outdoor bar and restaurant and trellised patios with places to sit or sunbathe.    Indoors there is a beautiful pool in a garden of palm trees bougainvillea bushes and large art pieces surrounded by red brick walls and an arched walkway. It is the place for breakfast where a friendly and attentive staff brings you fresh croissants fruits and juices to start your day. The dining experience is as perfect as the lodging and combines Moroccan and Mediterranean cuisine in are fined ambience. The restaurant of La Sultana offers a traditional Moroccan cuisine to reflect the flavors of the season with the Tasting Menu the Traditional Lamb Couscous with Seven Vegetables. Dinner is served either in the cozy atmosphere of the patio in the winter or on the rooftop overlooking the vibrant city and the Atlas mountains in the summer. A favorite experience for guests is that La Sultana delivers the secrets of popular Moroccan cuisine with daily cooking classes.    The spa at La Sultana evokes the sensuous world of the harem with ancient doors opening onto an interior of crimson marble illuminated by wrought-iron lanterns with a vaulted ceiling suspended on pillars rising up from a turquoise pool. The Sultana Spa offers two superb hammams a Jacuzzi sauna beauty centre hairdresser balneotherapy baths massage cabins in the open air. It is in the heart of the Sultana the hammam serves as a temple of body relaxation and spirit massage.    My adventure from this sanctuary called La Sultana lead me to explore the Medina just beyond the entrance. In the souk you’ll find a fascinating array of handicrafts from rugs and spices to hammered copper and brass goods and colorful fabrics. You can also take a horse drawn carriage to take in the sights.    La Sultana is in the district Quarter of the Imperial Kasbah which was a citadel and has been continuously occupied by the Sultans of Morocco since the twelfth century. Consequently this area focuses within the vicinity of the splendid palaces and magnificent monuments built by the Sultans. The Bab Agnaou is the most beautiful and impressive of the gates in the entire city ramparts; it was constructed in the twelfth century using local stone as the ceremonial entrance of the Sultans into the Kasbah. The gardens and pavilions of the Royal Palace dominate the view to the East from roof terraces.    After some touring and exploring I return back to my temporary sanctuary La Sultana for a few more days of rest and rejuvenation. La Sultana is a treasure of the Medina a remarkable and special hotel that will provide you with a not-to-be-missed experience in an exciting location.,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/564glennh

I felt like a Marrakech princess walking down their intricately textured decorated and lighted hallways. I stayed in the camel suite and I can honestly say I've never stayed in a hotel room quite like this before. The bathroom was fit for a king beautiful intricate doors a bathtub with beautiful pillars surrounding it (it was a little small to fit 2) but best of all was the service.

The way to the Riad was quite an adventure since it was Ramadan and it was after eight o'clock. The Riad is right behind the mosque so there was quite some crowd in rue de Kasbah.  There was a strong wind this evening the staff inmediately gave us a nice fleece blanket. The dinner was sublime we started off with an amuse bouche and for starters the best pastilla I ever had.

Its a beautiful peaceful riad and a perfect oasis away from the hustle and bustle of the medina. At times it felt like our own private residence ! We had dinner in the roof top restaurant and several lunches the food is excellent and the serving staff very knowledgeable . The bedrooms are just gorgeous and the bathrooms are just divine.

La Sultana Marrakech,ckd wrote a review Jun 2014,50,"Beautiful, ornate accommodations",My wife and I loved our 3 night stay at La Sultana. Much care has gone into developing the collection of Riads. It was a great retreat after wandering the streets alleys and souks of Marrakech. The staff were all very accommodating as is to be expected. We enjoyed the shaded pool area in the court area as opposed to trying to bake on the roof terrace like some pasty Brits chose. In other words there is a great variety of spaces throughout the facilities.    Our only gripe would be at the expense of breakfast. I had forgot that breakfast was not included (as is at most Riads) and when we were leaving we were given the $40 USD bill for some tea and a couple croissants. Had I remembered I would have definitely ordered more food.

Our room was excellently appointed and the service was superb. Although if I ever go back I would love to stay at one of the suites. We tried the restaurants and everything was good and beautifully presented. The spa is the best in Marrakech so be sure to try it.

Great roof terrace perfect for sunbathers with a stocked bar and cool restaurant for breakfast and lunch. Food is simple and easy in true Moroccan style - recommend the Pigeon Pastilla. The spa was excellent especially the massage - best I've had by far for a very long time - the masseuse knew what she was doing which is quite rare nowadays.

La Sultana Marrakech,Paul S wrote a review Apr 2014,40,tranquility away from the hustle and bustle,If your looking for a riad style smaller hotel but with facilities within the walls/scruffiness of the old city as opposed to the large modern hotels in the newer well laid out part of town then La Sultana meets this requirement though it is expensive. It is has a number of different riad style covered courtyards plus an indoor pool/inside dining area as well as rooftop terrace dining/drinks and soak pool. It also has a spa and a pc lounge. We dined out at other top restaurants in town so cant comment about the food but Saida especially and the front desk staff were excellent and extremely helpful. Housekeeping Staff and kids outside hotel entrance could be a bit noisy in the morning when we were trying to sleep late.  Marrakesh itself  The old city is very busy-we stayed 3 days but felt it could be done in a full single day to get the experience ie souks which are endless sheds of various objects mainly tat and old palaces/religious school all of similar design without any furnishings ie walls/floor/ceilings only but cheap to enter. Remember that the call to prayer occurs at 530am. We had a hot air balloon flight with Marrakesh by air to see sunrise over the atlas mountains and that was excellent though doesn't actually travel much distance.,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Dorridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulinDorridge87
La Sultana Marrakech,Aliceallovertheplace wrote a review Apr 2014,30,Rough diamond in the rough,LaSultana Marrakech is comprised of a cluster of four beautiful large riads. Its French owners - or someone - looks like they had fun decorating the place with brocade curtains heavy carved wood doors marble floors over-sized silver and pottery tea pots lovely blue and white tiled courtyards. The decor is whimsical; a blend of Morocco meets rococo meets Victorian mansion meets African safari.  But riads seem too small to over-decorate with heavy furniture. I don't get why hotels in Marrakech want to infuse the African theme. For one there are no lion buffalo or giraffe left in Morocco. The African art doesn't seem to work with a decor that seems to strive for sumptuous elegance and so comes off as gimmicky.  The Hammam was incredible (ask for Helen) but the massage so-so.  Food generally good if inconsistent. I thought the European dishes were better than the Moroccan.  LaSultana is meant to be a five-star hotel but the service is two star at best. I paid 500 dirham ($60) for a room service dinner with no wine - the risotto was delicious - but it was delivered on a tray with no drinking glasses. The plastic water bottle with a torn label was lying on its side.  Butter is served in cheap little plastic tubs.  There's a lovely dining area on the roof but in case it's cold and windy there are no other dining areas.  The rooms - three categories. The least expensive is way too small and the most expensive ridiculously large with two rooms a living area you never use. The Queen size room is the best value but they seem booked up early.  My last day I asked reception to arrange a car to take me to Tangiers. The manager beamed and gave me a quote that was $200 over an amount for a similar car I wound up arranging for myself.  The hotel is clean well-tended and tranquility pervades.  The staff was friendly and accommodating. But for me a five star hotel is not just about decor and a smiling staff.,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Nairobi, Kenya",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aliceallovertheplace

On arrival i was a wee bit thrown by the entrance and a bit apprehensive as its on a random market street with an abundance of mopeds and stalls but..... wow! First impressions are most deceiving...  This lovely wee boutique hotel is so quirky but un a very Moroccan chic way.  The staff are so attentive and lovely our room is very Moroccan a wee bit aladdin esque but very stylish with it.  The food is fabulous but our 1 down fall is the breakfast... if you love croissants bread cheese and eggs lovely but itd be nice to have more options small smudge on the perfect score id give this place.  My high point was when i asked the lovely lady from the spa (who came round as we were sunbathing)  She was an absolute legend and managed to arrange the manicurist to come and do my hands and toes in the sun... amazing service.  Another small detail is that there is a slight lack of pools we've spent most of our time on the lovely flowery tree lined roof but there is only a tiny 4x16(ish) plunge pool.  There is a slightly larger pool downstairs but i cant comment as i never got there.

We wanted to stay in a traditional Moroccan residence in the heart of the real Marrakech and this place certainly didn't disappoint. The architecture is absolutely amazing with something different around every corner - the five riads are all individual in their character and design and utterly charming. The service is second to none and the staff are so friendly and helpful. I must admit when we first arrived we were taken aback by the general atmosphere of the kasbah in the street outside La Sultana. However we soon got used to the general buzz of the place and had a great time exploring.

La Sultana Marrakech,MSROMH wrote a review Mar 2014,50,Peace and Tranquility,What a wonderful place to stay! It's not like any other hotel - indeed to call it a hotel demeans it because EVERYONE treats you as though you were a very special guest in their own home. That is hard to find. All staff are so polite and attentive and are happy to talk about anything. So a special mention and thank you to everyone we met particularly in the restaurant reception and spa and also a big thank you to all those behind the scenes whom we did not see but who help to make La Sultana such an out of this world destination.  This was our first visit to Marrakech so that first venture out to the souks and Place Jemaa el Fna was daunting indeed. When it all became too much we knew that we had a retreat to a place of peace and tranquility in La Sultana. It is hard to describe and believe but just 20 paces takes you from the frenetic street activity of the Kasbah to a place of quiet solitude and calm. As soon as you go through the doors of reception the noise heat and dust of the street disappear and you can lose yourself in any number of beautifully decorated alcoves rooms and themed courtyards/riads to relax and reflect. That helped us to appreciate Marrakech to the full as to begin with we were overwhelmed by the street life souks and Jemma el Fna but by the time we had to leave we did not want to go!  We also tried eating out to experience the vitality of the town at night but on the two occasions we did eat in La Sultana we concluded that we wished we had eaten in all the time. Food is superb choice is excellent and ambience wonderful. In fact we did not find a better room setting and atmosphere.  It only leaves us to say that we have no hesitation recommending La Sultana as THE place to stay in Marrakech and we will return ourselves.

La Sultana Marrakech,Alison T wrote a review Mar 2014,50,Fabulous and Convenient Hotel,We had the most fab time at La Sultana Hotel. The staff couldn't have been more helpful while we were there. They gave great recommendations for dining out which they booked for us and organised a guide for us for the souk and for a general tour around the Medina. They organised a trip into the Atlas Mountains and got our taxis for us too. The hotel is well placed for the Main Square which is 10 mins walk away as is the souk just at the back of the square. The Saddian tombs are adjacent to the hotel. Everything else is just a short easy taxi ride away. The roof terrace is lovely to sunbathe or watch the sun go down with a cocktail.  We had the Jaguar suite which was lovely and very well appointed though perhaps a little dark. The 2 balconies it had did help with that though and the bathroom was sumptuous! The complementary 1/2 bottle of champagne and delicious nibbles and fruit left in the room was a lovely touch along with free soft drinks from the mini bar.  The hotel has different styles in the riads which make it up - they are all gorgeous and we loved just wandering around them all. We both used the spa for massage which was what we needed after the souk and indeed seemed very popular with all guests. We dined in 2 nights and the food was delicious.

La Sultana Marrakech,davglyn wrote a review Mar 2014,50,A LITTLE BIT OF HEAVEN AND PEACE IN THE BUSSLE OF THE MEDINA,An upmarket and very romantic Riad. Upon entering for the first time we were taken not to the check in desk but to the roof terrace where we were offered mint tea whilst we completed the registration process. On a short stay of three nights we can only describe our whole stay as delightful. The Sultana consists of three separate Riads (town houses) that have been combined into one. We were double upgraded to a deluxe junior suite with its own balcony overlooking the pool below. Trying to describe the ambiance of the whole place is very difficult best to check out their own web address to see what an amazing place it is.  Just like staying in a Moroccon Palace. It is a short 10 minute walk from the Jemaa el-Fnaa square with all the souks surrounding it and a 10 minute taxi ride to the modernism of the new town. The service was excellent as was the restaurant food.,Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,london,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davglyn

The beautiful architecture within the hotel was a site itself and the staff made every effort to make the visit memorable and personal. There were a few special touches that I've never experienced before at other four star hotels. I especially enjoyed the welcome tea on the roof the personalized news in the morning and the late night staff ready to serve you cocktails wherever you please in the hotel. They also expertly guided us to dinner and arranged a very special excursion. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel for anyone looking to experience all the excitement and beauty of Marrakesh.

Thank you very much for incredible 5 days indulgence at your beautiful property in Marrkaesh. My friends and I enjoyed our stay big time: great personalized service great rooms attentive skilled staff members fantastic terrace and efficient concierge suggesting and booking best restaurants in town. Location is perfect too especially if you come for the first time and willing to discover Medina- medieval heart of Marrakesh. Everything you except from a five star boutique hotel - member of Small Luxury Hotels you will find there. The place gives you a feeling of private exotic manor (Vizir's riad) rather then a luxury hotel. Everything is unique and hand crafted. Owners have great sense of beauty and art. Nice paintings and artifacts all over the place.    Spa is very beautiful but therapists should pay bit more attention to details and techniques.

La Sultana Marrakech,hughwebbon wrote a review Feb 2014,50,Outstanding hospitality and service.,"The Hotel ranks with the best hospitality I have experienced in the world. I am away up to 150 days a year staying at 5 star or boutique establishments and this is no idle compliment. The Hotel has managed to capture the essence of genteel living in Marrakech where the Riad is a haven of peace and tranquility nestled into the frantic buzz of the city outside. Add this to a Company ethic of outstanding service quality together with one of the finest and most tasteful building redevelopments and one has a flawless product.    The level of personal service is a credit to the training and supervision of the hotel management. Staff are obviously proud to work for the hotel and anticipate a guest's needs so nothing is a problem. The standards of cuisine are excellent. The wine list is very good but ask for recommendations from the Moroccan selection which is outstanding.    The Spa is exceptional. Rooms are well appointed and scrupulously clean. The pool area is an ""Arabian Nights"" dream after dark.    Sipping a 'sundowner' on the roof terrace watching the sunset and the majestic Atlas Mountains as the stars emerge while hearing the faint sounds of the vibrant city somewhere in the world below should be on everyone's list of essential life experiences.

The food in the restaurant was very good quality and not overpriced the beef tag one with almonds and sultanas was very nice.

The room we were given (an upgrade to Panther...low season) was comfortable and well appointed. In the evening (it was cold and rainy in January) a man came with logs and made a very welcoming fire  The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful from the front desk people to the waiters and the driver who picked us up from the airport.  I found the food a little expensive though the evening meal was good but the breakfast could have been better...the cooked breakfasts were not inspiring and there could have been a much better selection of breads and cold foods rather than so many sweet things.

La Sultana Marrakech,GBN31 wrote a review Jan 2014,30,Room felt like a cell.,I would have liked to given this hotel 5 stars. The service is impeccable and the breakfast is wonderful. The people are just so amazingly nice. But my room was small and very claustrophobic and felt like a cell. This is a riad so the architecture is typical but my room was small and felt like it had no air. Moreover everytime I needed to adjust the air conditioning (absolutely necessary as there was no window in the room) I needed to call reception and they had to send up someone with the remote control - something I have never experienced before. It meant that I was sometimes way too cold or too hot as I did not wish to call someone at 3am.  Perhaps the larger rooms are better but if you are at all claustrophobic don't take a smaller one.,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Vancouver, BC",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GBN31
La Sultana Marrakech,TuncY wrote a review Jan 2014,50,"Amazing design, excellent service and location!","This is an amazing ""Riad"" (hotel with traditional inner court).    The design is to say the least impressive. Once through the gates you will be struck with the ""1001 nights"" middle eastern atmosphere. It might be extravagant and a little over the top but Marrakech is not the perfect setting for a minimalist isn't it?    The rooftop -that we regretfully couldn't use to full effect because of chilly nights in January- is a class of its own. It is a real blessing to be able to escape the chaos of the Medina and enjoy the views with a nice drink.    Located at a 10-12 minutes walk from the Jama el Fnaa square (on a main street) it might not be as close as other Riads but being a little away from the center is a bonus when getting in and out of the Medina (the old city). In addition I have seen some Riads on dark alleyways and I can guarantee you will want your hotel on a main street accessible by car.    The restaurant located in the main courtyard in the winter looks surreal. Dark candlelights oriental music inner pool etc... You get the idea. Food is very good. Service at the restaurant is ok but not perfect. The music is very nice the first night (an old musician playing a stringed instrument with occasional arabic vocals) but if you dine twice it kind of gets on your nerves. I would suggest removing the amplifier to reduce volume and maybe have different musicians.    Service in the hotel was excellent. The concierge was extremely helpful in organizing every aspect of our trip the drivers we had for airport transfers and day trips were excellent. Everything was perfect.

La Sultana Marrakech,Nina A wrote a review Nov 2013,50,"Magical, transporting oasis",We did a lot of research when planning our trip to Marrakech in Sept of 2012 and La Sultana exceeded all expectations. The property itself is beautiful and secluded. All the rooms are different - we got to experience two of them during two different stays. Although you realize it's a hotel you really feel like you're staying in some pasha's private Kasbah and you are the only guest there.Whether you're having breakfast on the breathtaking rooftop or relaxing by the pool in the shade La Sultana feels magical luxurious relaxing and very organic. The staff are truly fantastic and key to making your stay unforgettable. From the front desk being able to help you with absolutely anything to the spa attendants and waiters in the restaurant everyone is the kindest person you'll ever meet. I called the hotel before our trip and Mohammed helped me plan a trip to the desert that was the most memorable and romantic thing we've ever done. We were alone in a luxury camp in the middle of the Sahara under the stars. It was absolutely magical. Mohammed also helped us book a tour guide to walk around Marrakech and was there to answer any questions make suggestions and make sure we had everything we needed.

La Sultana Marrakech,RockySimba wrote a review Nov 2013,50,"Fantastic hotel, great location","This is a small luxury hotel 28 rooms in what could be an old palace. I learned that a French couple remodeled it to look like an old palace and they did a great job with lots of authentic architectural detail. In my opinion the building was better than the actual palace we did visit.    The hotel is built around 5 courtyards or ""riads"" each with a different look. Each courtyard is shared by a few of the rooms. The rest of the hotel is decorated well also. The hotel has a small pool which was a must for my daughter.    There is a garden courtyard on top of the building which has a bar and restaurant for breakfast and lunch. Dinner is held in the main courtyard where the pool is located. They put out candles and the hotel was specially lit at night to make it seem magical. They also burned incense in the hotel to give it more atmosphere. The food was great and dinner had an Arab classical guitarist. The restaurant is separately listed in the Tripadvisor top 10 at the time of this review.    The service was also great. This is a five-star hotel and the service was exactly that. We did the spa also. The spa is beautiful. The massage was great but my wife said the mani/pedi she received was more of an accommodation to the guests and not something they did well.    Once you leave the hotel and walk out a short alley you enter a main shopping street in Marrakech. In 10 minutes you can walk to the ""main square"" which is basically the center of the medina or old town. There is located the entrance to the ""souk"" or artisan shops. The main square is a local landmark and anyone on the street will point you there. They actually call it ""the main square"". From the main square we visited some of the top Tripadvisor sights like the palace and madrassa.The hotel itself is in the medina and is about 15 minutes to the airport.    The only drawback for this hotel was the price. I paid about $800 for a suite plus $100 for an extra bed for my daughter and $20 each for breakfast. With taxes etcetera the price per night was over $1000 more than my usual budget. If this is within your budget this should not be a problem. I think the hotel was worth the money.    Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Marrakech. A word about Marrakech. It is dirty and smelly but the people were very friendly. It's an exotic unusual place to visit and a throwback to medeval times. A great place for experienced travellers looking for an authentic place to see. The country is a former French colony so the local speak mainly arabic and French though most of the tourist places spoke at least limited English.

La Sultana Marrakech,Firmdale wrote a review Oct 2013,50,Wonderful boutique hotel,After a very early start to catch the 06.15 easyJet flight to Marrakech and a ridiculous wait in the immigration hall at Menara airport we endured a long bumpy and scenically dull 4 hour drive to Oualidia.    The approach on the elevated coast road isn't promising but as you descend to the property itself the beautiful architecture and manicured grounds of the property hint at the promise of what lies inside – truly a reward for an arduous journey.    La Sultana really is an oasis within the surrounding desert. The hotel itself rooms public areas and restaurants are simply yet sensitively designed. Our deluxe suite was enormous and the space was appreciated with our eight year old son sharing the room.    The outdoor swimming pool is beautiful if a little chilly during late October but it's a great and necessary place to lounge as the sea quality in the lagoon is well lagoonish.    However the stand-out quality of this small hotel is the service. From the front desk to the waiters there was a genuine warmth to the welcome. Our son's name was quickly remembered and nothing was too much trouble. Rarely have we met waiting staff who appeared to be so authentically into their jobs. Surfing lessons were arranged a canoe was provided and the GM Khalil Guerraoui went out of his charming way to ensure that our brief two night stay was comfortable.    A spectacular hotel modest in its pretence and one of few that actually delivers beyond expectations. The GM warned us that our next stop at Bab Ourika might disappoint and he wasn't wrong. What he didn't know is that his operation also knocked the spots off the much vaunted and yet lamentable Palais Namaskar in Marrakech. The small La Sultana group is one to watch.

The location is beautifully ""arab"" and this is what I wanted: not an international hotel but a very ""arabic"" and decorated place. The suite we were in was beautiful clean and very wel equipped. We had massages at Spa and the ladies who took care of us were very professional. To dine at the terrace restaurant was lovely romantic and food and also Moroccon wines were very good with also the touch of their musicand voice....it was exactly what I expected to receive.Probably the only ""defect"" was the small space around the swimming pool in our Riad or let's say that when we were there the Hotel was full. Our experience was really beautiful also because of the position that allowed us to walk at midnight and it was not dangerous.

La Sultana Marrakech,GarethAdams wrote a review Sep 2013,50,"Great location, great hotel",The hotel itself is made up of a number of houses and the variety of architectural styles makes for a fascinating atmosphere.  The staff could not have been more friendly or efficient. Our dietary needs were understood and well catered for from the off and with some thoughtfulness. The room (La dromaderie) was a hoot with an amazing bathroom and spotless.  Dinner around the pool and breakfast on the roof terrace were treats as was the view down into the kasbah and the royal tombs.

La Sultana Marrakech,Anna S wrote a review Sep 2013,50,Little oasis in the crazy Medina,After two nights in the Palmeraie region of the city my husband and I headed to the medina for one night. La Sultana is in the Kasbah region of the medina and a 10 minute walk to the jemaa el fna (main square). We were greeted when we arrived by the luggage porter and welcomed into the main Riad (La Sultana is 5 small riads joined together) and offered traditional Moroccan Tea and pastries. We were shown all around the hotel and then to our room - the Lion apartment. Beautifully authentic old Marrakech. We had drinks on the roof listening to the magical call to prayer and were only sorry that we had dinner reservations elsewhere that night. Khalid on the Front Desk was an angel - always smiling and nothing was too much trouble for him.

The style is very traditional and authentic loads of lovely artifacts and magical little corners of peace but also very luxurious. Nice ppol alhtough a bit crowded during the afternoon. Our room was the apartment a great option for a family of 4. Breakfast was really good on the terrace but the dinner on the roof was truly outstanding - the tasting meal at around £60 per head without wine was a high cost but the food and location and service made is very special - highly recommended.

La Sultana Marrakech,tom_uk1976 wrote a review Jul 2013,50,Wonderful luxury Riad,"Myself and three friends recently stayed at the Sultana we had rather a fraught journey over but on arrival at the Riad all was quickly forgotten. The reception staff ushered us through and served us tea and pastries whilst they performed all the check in formalities for us. We were then shown to our beautiful rooms these really were quite something. We ate in the restaurant upstairs beautiful setting the food was good but it probably didn't live upto the places we ate on the other nights. The pool in the courtyard is a haven from the heat and hustle and bustle of Marrakech we always had a choice of sun loungers this may have been due to the fact we were there in ""low"" season though. The treatments offered aren't cheap but certainly enable you to relax properly. The location of the Riad is excellent only a 10 minute walk from the main square with all the Souks etc etc. In short a great place to stay and I'd happily come back for another break.",Date of stay: July 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tom_uk1976

The roof terrace is simply perfect to enjoy the last of the afternoon sun and escape the noise and bustle of Marrakech. Our room was lovely other reviews have commented on the rooms being dark I found this kept the room cool private and also provided the perfect conditions for a great nights sleep.    The restaurant food was wonderful and service on the whole very good reception staff in particular were fantastic providing some good advice and booking cabs etc. Service at breakfast was sometimes a little slow but the staff were always polite.

We arrived late but were met with a smile and some welcome refreshments and pastries.    You must try the restaurant - it isn't cheap (£90 for a three course meal for two with no alcohol) but the ambience of the roof-top together with the excellent menu choice makes it worth a go.

From the moment we checked in which was made to feel very pleasant in itself. We felt like we were the only guests in the hotel. Nothing was too much trouble for the wonderful staff here. Our room was a basic twin which my friend and I found to be perfectly adequate. Bathroom very well equipped. No complaints at all there. Nice touch to have daily complementary water and soft drinks in the room. Swimming pool which I believe is quite rare for a riad to have was small but perfectly formed. The spa and treatments we had were lovely could have gone every day had funds permitted! Breakfast was simple but just enough and the food a lunchtime delicious. The riad is perfectly situated in the Kasbah and a short walk from the lively main square and souks. Superb staff who really made us feel special and they were there to make us happy.

La Sultana Marrakech,Denis T wrote a review Jun 2013,50,A Perfect ' 10 ',I travel abroad maybe half a dozen times a year and have only ever been compelled to do one review because the hotel I stayed in in Cannes was so bad. But  I felt only for the second time in a few years to write another but this time for the opposite reason. This hotel is wonderful ! It was a calm and beautiful hideaway and was so peaceful it could have been in the middle of a desert but in fact if you walk out on to the street you were in the bustling Medina. We had a perfect room called ' Puma ' a strange name for a room but it was lovely. From the moment we walked in to the room and closed the door we felt we were in our own little world peaceful quiet and very very relaxing.    Every single member of staff from the reception to the bell boy to the restaurant staff and the spa  could not have been any better. Always with genuine smiles and so friendly and helpful.    Only 28 rooms you feel like you have the whole place to yourself very romantic and a very special place.    Just inside the Medina walls and only a ten minute walk from the main square.    A special mention must be made for our guide who was recommended by the hotel Moulat. A very friendly  decent and unimposing man who showed us things we would not have seen had we just walked around on our own. He made Marrakesh a much more memorable holiday for us and we would totally recommend that you use him if you stay at the hotel.    In the last couple of years I have stayed at some great hotels like the Carlton in Cannes the Victoria Grand in Switzerland and Villa D'este in lake Como and the Sultana Marrakesh is every bit as good but with a special ambience and very personal service that larger hotels could only aspire to be like.,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Southampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denist598

La Sultana Marrakech,Arthalus wrote a review May 2013,40,An authentically good experience,You would never think as you wander down the chaotic dusty donkey cart infested street with a perfume which alternates between the smoke of street vendors' charcoal barbecues and the sweet aromatic symphony of the many herbalist shops that you were 20 meters from a luxury oasis.    The hotel is delightful mix of authentic Moroccan architecture styles finishes and fabrics understated and achieved with a certain grace. Use of natural lighting sets off the typical brickwork and the amazing intricacy of the carved paster and wood fretwork in every angle.    We stayed in the Jaguar suite which was very stylishly finished with a sunken bath marble throughout two terraces and two sitting rooms and walk in wardrobe. Despite its size however it remained quite intimate and cozy with a lovely outlook over the courtyard pool.    The staff are friendly attentive and professional and everything was made seamless and easy. The restaurant on the roof terrace at lunchtime is competent and has a limited but tasty menu. In the evening the restaurant moves to being around the pool and is both romantic and pretty good if not a little expensive (compared to similar standard non hotel restaurants so nothing new there). Try the Moroccan tasting menu as it will give you good first impression of Morrocan food.    Finally when you have had enough of the souks grab a sun-bed on the rooftop enjoy the complimentary virgin Mojito's and chill in the North African sun (don't forget the sun cream!).,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Mykonos, Greece",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arthalus

La Sultana Marrakech,Pickfitz wrote a review May 2013,50,Oasis amongst the mayhem!,A stay at La Sultana is a different world from that outside in the mayhem that is Marrakech. When we were dropped off by the taxi from the airport we thought there must have been a mistake we could not have paid so much to be staying in this dingy noisy back street. Don't be fooled. Within seconds we were ensconced in the grandeur calm and peace that is La Sultana.    Our stay couldn't have been better the staff were attentive without being overbearing which was a relief from the frenzy and stress (why do the shop keepers not seem to understand that they are likely to sell much more if you are left alone?) that is shopping in Marrakech.    The hotel itself is fabulous the attention to detail faultless and although we thought it was perhaps slightly overdone feels very grand just as an old palace may have been. Our room was sumptuous with everything you could need or want. The only slight flaw was the wonderful rainfall shower which it was impossible to use without soaking the bathroom; but this wasn't much of a problem with the housekeeping coming in every evening to turn down the sheets and clearly mop the floor.    Marrakech is quite an expensive city to eat if you want decent food so although La Sultana wasn't cheap it compared well with other places we visited. And although it was wonderful to eat beneath the stars we were underwhelmed by the lighting. I'm all for ambient lighting in the right place but it would have been nice to see what we were eating. Fortunately we were early enough to be able to read the menu but more experienced visitors than ourselves had brought mini torches. A handy tip!    It was only a short walk to the Jemaa-el-Fna and if you enjoy taking your life into your hands - there seem to be no rules of the road - it is an unmissable experience to join in the evening promenade.    Overall we had a great time both in Marrakech and in La Sultana. It was a relief to hide away beside the pool after a frenetic morning and to recharge the batteries ready for the chaos that is a Marrakechi evening.,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Aylesbury,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pickfitz

Even the mini bar consumption of soft drinks was included.    Breakfast was served on the roof of the Riad and one could survey some of the kasbah including the Saadian Tombs which are next door.

La Sultana Marrakech,globaltrotte wrote a review May 2013,40,Very special & beautiful Riad but over priced,The hotel has some luxurious rooms and amazing surroundings with several courtyards and a roof terraces. The decorations in the room and bath-room are unique; it is like staying in the 1001 fair-tale places. The reception manager Saida is very friendly and super professional; she made our stay in the hotel enjoyable despite the problems with the room and the check-in process. The dinner is very good with nice service and beautiful surrounding near the pool.  The hotel is more suitable for couples without children. Furthermore we missed that personal approach which we experienced at some other hotels of this price range. For instance the service during the check-in process was unacceptable. Upon our arrival at 12:45 we were told that the Prestige double room we booked does not allow a child so we had to take one of their suits with significant amount of additional charges. We accepted it but had to wait more than 2½ hours for the room to be ready even though we informed them that we have been up since 5:30 am and would really like to have our room as soon as possible. The elevator needs urgent service so it would not make such noise that clearly went through to this expensive suit. The staff at the breakfast is friendly but it misses that extra level of genuine engagement. A normal taxi from airport without any bargain cost 50 MAD. The hotel charged us 380 MAD for a very old & dirty car to pick us up from the airport. The benefit was that there was no problem to find the hotel. The street immediately outside of the hotel was dirty smelling of garbage and crowded.,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Shanghai, China",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/globaltrotte

La Sultana Marrakech,Jean1730 wrote a review May 2013,40,almost excellent with some comments,We are Marrakech lovers and Morocco lovers in general therefore we spend the second short holiday this year at our beloved country. This time we booked in LS based on the feed back from TA travellers whilst our earlier stay was spend at Riad Idra.  Overall LS is a very good hotel which offers the std comfort of a 5* rated hotel but it misses that extra level of genuine engagement of the staff: the terras could be a wonderful place but the staff for whatever reason forgets to pamper the hosts with some genuine friendliness and hospitality. From a 5* hotel you should expect with the limited number of tables what yr guests drink or with how many people they are so table can be dressed accordingly. Here it was like every day was a new day for the waiters and we missed that personal approach which we experienced at some other hotels of this price range.  It has to be said that all other staff is extremely friendly and even if we had an smell issue in our room the manager without hesitation offered us to change room and to do all moves themselves. Really appreciated.  So overall we really appreciated the hotel but not enough to return as it missed that Small Luxury Hotel personal touch.,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Asse, Belgium",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jean1730

La Sultana Marrakech,Tanja L wrote a review Apr 2013,50,oasis in moorish style,My husband and I stayed for 3 nights in this wonderful hotel. Each detail is excellent. We booked in for a Junior Suite and asked for a room with a balcony. And the Concierge managed it to give us a beautiful room with a great balcony looking to the swimming pool. The bathroom was like you feel in thousands and one night. A very romantic place. I really would like to give a compliment to the cleaning persons: They tidied up the rooms very carefully; each day there were petals of roses in the bathroom.  The Quarter in which the hotel is located is very interesting. You can look to a market from the top of the hotel. But you have to walk about 15 minutes to the souks.  And one great welcome: We arrived at about 12 o`clock and the management of the hotel gave us a room for the time our room was prepared. Thanks for the wunderful stay.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Wurzburg, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AntoineC326
La Sultana Marrakech,MarthaFMaraLuna wrote a review Apr 2013,50,My absolute favorite hotel!!,This hotel is the most exquisite place we have ever visited. Our Elephant bedroom was so beautiful romantic and comfortable I could have stayed there for ever! The attention to details and its architecture throughout the hotel made us feel we were experiencing old Marrakech. The food and service were fantastic. Having dinner at their Terrace's Restaurant while watching the sky and hearing their prayer's calling was mystical! Spending a day hiking the Atlas Mountains and having lunch there was amazing.

La Sultana Marrakech,Inessairena wrote a review Mar 2013,50,Beautiful hotel in the heart of Kasbah,We only stayed in this hotel for a few days wishing we could have stayed for a bit longer. La Sultana is a beautifully designed hotel combining 5 separate riads each one of them have different feel and finishes. Some riads are minimalistic and traditional and some very bold and colourful eager to surprise you with distinctive African furniture. We have stayed in the Africa themed riad in the gazelle room. The room wasn’t very large but was well designed and comfortable. Housekeeping went the extra mile to keep our room clean and tidy rose petals in the bathroom and traditional sweets and nuts on a tea table were well received. Small touches like chocolates at night and complementary gifts made us feel very special. Everything from arrival to departure was perfect and well thought The hotel staff are well trained and exceptionally polite & helpful but not intrusive.  Breakfast in the hotel simply amazing with prepared to order dishes. The ingredients used are the highest quality and cooked to perfection. Those tasty dishes are served in the restaurant area which is beautifully designed around the indoor swimming pool.  On the first night we drank cocktails in the basement bar that resembles a luxury boat the barmaid was very friendly and made as feel very welcome.  One evening we used the indoor pool in Spa area and had an amazing experience there which made us feel very invigorated before a night out.  Throughout our stay we used different communal areas which were designed in an individual style and for different purpose finishes in the hotel are wonderful and you can admire so many pieces of beautiful furniture and decorative objects around the hotel.  I highly recommend this hotel to couples for romantic breaks.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Inessairena

La Sultana Marrakech,LynandDaveUK wrote a review Mar 2013,50,Wonderful staff and hotel,My wife and I stayed at La Sultana for 7 nights in mid-March. We had a ground floor Prestige room which was very well appointed and spacious. The service in all areas of the hotel from reception to restaurants was superb. We ate dinner in the hotel several times and particularly enjoyed sharing the shoulder of lamb. Less enjoyable was the musician who plays ethnic music endlessly - a short break occasionally for some peaceful conversation would be welcome! The staff must get a particular mention. They were always attentive without being obtrusive addressed us by name and seemed to anticipate our needs even before we knew them ourselves. The hotel's location is within easy walking distance of many of the places of interest in the centre of Marrakech. It's not cheap but is heartily recommended.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Devizes, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LynandDaveUK

La Sultana Marrakech,Enamelina wrote a review Feb 2013,40,Lovely Hotel,We stayed here for two nights in February. The hotel is beautiful whichever part you stay in is highly decorative. There are several courtyards and our room Camélion opened onto the largest where the swimming pool is and also the restaurant for breakfast and dinner. This had one great advantage. In the afternoons after we had visited the Medina there was never anyone at the pool. With the pool just outside our room it was like having our own private pool!  Our room was very nice with some exquisite Morrocan details although I found a little small. The bath was quirky and the bathroom was lovely with a variety of lighting. The bed was sooooooo comfortable and huge. Lighting in the room was atmospheric and innovative but it lacked the odd lamp here and there. There was a desk but absolutely no lighting at that end of the room. For a new hotel we found the lack of sockets irritating. We couldn't both charge our phones at the same time and all sockets were inaccessible except one in the bathroom.  Breakfast was really nice an array of juices cereals and breads and things on the breakfast menu we have never been offered before or even heard of before. The cooked food you order is delicious hot and arrived quickly. Breakfast service was really excellent.  Dinner? Dinner was strange. Service seemed slow and underwhelming although always polite. The food was a little bland and the style inconsistent considering there was only one menu. One evening our main courses really made us laugh. My plate looked like I was eating in a Michelin starred restaurant - a plate of neatly arranged food equal to any fine dining restaurant and my husbands looked like a meal for at least 4 hungry peasants plonked on the table with no finesse at all!! The other thing about dinner.... there is a musician who sits at the other side of the pool. He plays authentic Morrocan music. At first you think this is nice then you wonder if he will ever take a break (he doesn't) as it become tedious and then it becomes downright irritating. It is loud and the sound harsh with all the hard surfaces. After dinner we would have like to have sat on our terrace with a drink or two and relaxed. Instead we had to go into our room and shut the shutters and watch a DVD.  The hotel claims the rooms are soundproofed and we can testify they certainly arewe couldn't hear the music from inside our room so you will not be disturbed by noise in this hotel.  One thing I would like to mention we went in Februaryearly in the month. The days were pleasantly warm and the nights very cold. The hotel has a system of covering the courtyards with a clear plastic roof so that you are not cold when dining swimming or sitting. This makes everything more comfortable. There is a superb roof terrace with tiny plunge pool where you can enjoy sunbathing(there are sunbeds) fresh air refreshments and lunch in the open air restaurant.  The position of the hotel is pretty good as you can walk to everywhere in the Medina from there. There is a huge taxi station nearby if you want to go outside the Medina.  I don't have anything bad to say about the hotel and I would certainly stay there again but I did email several times before we went to ask for a pick up from the airport and did not get a reply. In the end I had to phone to confirm the airport pick up which was there to pick us up and bring us to the hotel in a nice air conditioned limousine. I did feel that the service was very good but did not match the price paid for the hotel but perhaps that is Morrocco.,Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,South Coast,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Enamelina

Every day you discover something new walking in the various corridors stairs rooms which animate this special place.  The entry of the hotel is completely hidden arriving from the kasbah. As soon as you step in the hotel you find a different world full of serenity and extreme relaxation. All the 31 rooms have a different design and personality. We love to have breakfast and dinner in the small restaurant around the pool seating always at different tables discovering new angles of beauty. View from the roof is amazing with the Atlas mountains far away on the horizon and just below the fast life of the Medica with its sounds parfume and colours. Service in the restaurant was excellent very professional concierge staff and a very amazing hotel guide Hassan.

La Sultana Marrakech,thetinasmiths wrote a review Jan 2013,50,an Arabian Dream,our family with 2 teenagers stayed at La Sultana for 4-5 days and could have spent a month- or more!  La Sultana is beautiful peaceful quiet and comfortable in the midst of bustling Marrakech. The staff is superb- and will arrange everything. Every room is gorgeous and different in design and decor elements- while maintaining your arabian dream.  You can walk to almost everywhere you want to go within the city walls which makes morning and late afternoon ideal for touring around easy and spontaneous (early morning runs recommended for optimal weather nice orientation less crowds and a real picture of daily life in Marrakech). Breakfast or evening drinks on the roof deck overlooking the city surrounding you are a must for sunrises and sunsets. Mid afternoons are usually hot- so ideal time to rendevous back at La Sultana for lunch at the poolside. Although the restaurant is superb the staff will help book the best tables at the best and most scenic restaurants in Marrakech for a few dinners. They also will arrange the requisite camel rides just outside the city.

La Sultana Marrakech,NWHPMK wrote a review Jan 2013,50,Too short a stay,La Sultana is a true haven of peace and tranquility in a chaotic environment. It`s standards are far higher than the other 5 star hotels. It is elegant smart and fantastically stylish but not in a garish or excessive manner.  The staff are genuinely considerate and patient; wishing for your comfort at all times and thinking ahead to your needs.  The rooms are designed in a unique and comfortable way and spa and the staff there are superb too.  The welcome is generous and considerate with a little surprise and so is the departure... I won`t spoil it for you!  There is a tour of the hotel too so if you prefer another room or suite you can chose more easily too.  How could it get better? Well it can... the food in the restaurant cannot be beaten. The menu is a fusion of French and Moroccan cuisine and it works remarkably well.  I cannot recommend it more highly.

Everything about this place and the people who work there is AMAZING! From the moment we walked in it was all about our comfort and the staff did all they could to make our stay unforgettable. Khalid welcomed us with a delicious cup of mint tea before showing us to our beautiful room. The Prestige room we had was spacious and very private. Only metres away lies the hustle and bustel of Marrakesh and yet it is so quiet inside the walls of La sultana. Breakfast is delicious and there are many choices on the menu as well as a buffet. The rooftop area is great for lunch. The bar opens at 6pm and we had our very own friendly barman. Dinner menu is great food is so fresh and not too pricey. The reception staff are very helpful they organised a guide to spend half a day with us. Nothing was too much trouble. The Spaa is lovely. My husband and I had a body scrub treatment and massage and we thoroughly enjoyed the pampering. They even left a sweet gift for us on the last night. It was definitely a five star experience.

La Sultana Marrakech,eric g wrote a review Nov 2012,50,Spectacular!,This place is spectacular. It's in the medina of Marrakech in the kasbah area and from the outside doesn't look like much. In fact from the street you wouldn't even know that this very large hotel is even there. Inside it's a beautiful restoration of several traditional riads each one more eye-popping than the last for their elegant traditional interiors. There is a large swimming pool in the final courtyard. Meals are served around the pool. The restaurant is superb. Everything we ate was good but we particularly recommend the sampler menu to get an idea of fine Moroccan cuisine and the skills of the chef. Our suite was lovely a two-story affair with all sorts of nooks and and fine Moroccan furniture. I suppose every room is different in layout and/or furnishings so you might want to take a look at yours before you accept it. The staff are highly professional. There is a very pleasant planted roof terrace where you can also eat and drink and look out over the daily life of the medina. The medina itself is fascinating although the speeding mopeds that go swerving and honking up and down the narrow alleys are really dangerous and detract from the experience. The whole atmosphere of the medina must have been so different before the masses of mopeds arrived on the scene.,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/858ericg

La Sultana Marrakech,Nicola P wrote a review Nov 2012,50,Arabian nights experience,We stayed at La Sultana mid October and had a wonderful room - Giraffe - overlooking the pool with a balcony which we made use of for morning coffee and in the evening for a digestif listening to the musician. The hotel is magical in design and the staff so warm and friendly. I made friends with Lynne Hey and family so it is good to see her review too. Reception was excellent in recommending places to visit or sorting out any minor issues immediately. The breakfast and dinner was excellent especially the tasting menu - and the chef took the time to visit us and seek feedback. I went out and about on my own with confidence in Marrakesh which not many women did but I found the city exciting and vibrant with life. Despite the intgroduction of the fixed price green taxis we were overcharged and the hotel spend nearly a day getting the overcharge back for us - how is that for service? Jasmine and her husband could not have done more for us in the restaurant and we wish them well for the future. Mohammed is an asset to front of house. Our antique rug arrived from Morroco yesterday. Price started at £10000 and we settled at £3000 delivered and taxed UK. My husband was described as a Berber in terms of negotiation!! So lovely memories to reflect on and a stunning rug to view each day. We intend to visit La Sultana again and combine with a visit to their sister hotel on the coast and a trip to the desert.,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sudbury, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/488NicolaP
La Sultana Marrakech,lynne_hey wrote a review Nov 2012,50,Amaze all of your senses,Stayed here for the last 2 weeks of October the weather was mostly good but a few rainy days.  All of the rooms are completely different I have never stayed anywhere quite like this there are actually 5 Riads at this property. The location is in the Kasbah a very busy area taxis are unable to park directly outside of the property they park on the street and it is a short walk to La Sultana which is like a tardis! Upon entering the area just beyond the small reception the smell of incense envelops you Moroccan lanterns adorn the passage offering a romantic glow initiating a feeling of complete tranquillity away from the chaos outside. The staff are excellent nothing is too much trouble Saida is superb she organised many different activities for us restaurants guides a trip to the Atlas Mountains. The Spa here is very good I can recommend Jasmine she is very very strong so if you like a hard massage you will not be disappointed! If you need a cab use Abdulmoula he won't rip you off (they know him at the hotel if you ask) he even offered to pay our hotel bill when the hotel chip and pin machine didn't work! If you need a guide it costs around £15 for half a day Havid(Hafeed) is a real gentleman and extremely knowledgeable. If you drink alcohol I would suggest you buy some duty free on the plane as all of the alcohol here appears to be quite expensive. The food at La Sultana is good as much as you like at breakfast with a large and varied selection of produce.  This is a very busy area with a great deal going on I was there for the first week with my 16 year old daughter and although we initially felt a little conspicuous after a couple of days we were absolutely fine. To watch belly dancing I can recommend La Comptoir but go late it starts around 10.30pm and at the weekend ensure you have seats upstairs (although the tables are a little low). We dined at the Royal Mansour it cost just short of £400 for 2 including drinks mega expensive but WOW! We also visited the Kasbah Tamadot (Richard Bransons place) the property is amazing but appeared quite isolated compared to La Sultana the food was mediocre not what we expected to be fair it was just the one meal but we were disappointed. There are over 2600 shops in the Souks so every day is different. For me it was a holiday like no other. I hope that my comments help anyone considering a visit.,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bradenton, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lynne_hey

La Sultana Marrakech,eyefordetail2 wrote a review Oct 2012,50,"Personal service, in an atmosphere of peace and tranquility",A beautiful restoration of 5 riads tucked away from the bustle/noise/smells of the Kasbah Quarter. The central courtyard is a lovely setting for excellent food. Dinner here is a 'must' with very reasonably-priced food and wines. Lots of individual sitting areas with a pleasant rooftop terrace. The staff provided first class service and English was widely spoken. Do not be put off by the lack of the 'Grand Entrance'; this is a riad-style hotel and once inside the door it is total peace. We were delighted with our suite - individual stylish and huge! Thank you La Sultana and thank you for the nice treats in our room before check-out.

There is a large roof terrace where breakfast and dinner are served and my wife decribed her spa treatment as the best she's ever had.

La Sultana Marrakech,30Anonymous wrote a review Oct 2012,40,Our stay at La Sultana,We thoroughly enjoyed our recent 5 night stay at La Sultana in Marrakech. The hotel is very handy for Medina square and soukhs. The rooms are furnished very elegantly and we found the staff to be extremely efficient and polite. We could only fault one area and that is the rooftop area. Although we enjoyed breakfast and dinner here there is limited service throughout the rest of the day. Although there are plenty of sunloungers and a pool it is difficult to obtain drinks.    We would recommend that anyone wishing to visit the soukhs or nearby places of interest takes a local guide. We used a person called Ahmed which La Sultana arranged for us on two consecutive mornings and found him to be excellent. He also represented very good value for money.,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/30Anonymous

La Sultana Marrakech,Marco A wrote a review Sep 2012,40,Absolute Relax,This Riad is the state of art for luxurious and amazing place in the tradition of this Country. Secluded from the noise You will just have to choose where to lay lazy.... The staff is always at Your service (my opinion is that the roof bar must be open till 1.00 am at least to enjoy the fantastic atmosphere of the night). All the rooms are different and furnished with taste. The location is perfect. The restaurant is fantastic for dinner on the roof terrace and the food quality is of high level.  Only one suggestion such a beautiful place must not accept kids under 12.  Nothing personal I have three but in my opinion You cannot oblige people that pay to go in such a relaxing place to listen the big mess that young kids normally do and it is good they do.

La Sultana Marrakech,Graeme G wrote a review Sep 2012,50,Honeymoon,This was a very special time for us and we spent a lot of time trying to find a special hotel for a special week!..... This hotel exceeded all our expectations in particular the service nothing was too much trouble. I have used several SLH hotels over the years and this one tops the lot! My wife and I spend a lot of time travelling and staying in hotels all over the world so we are very particular in our choice. As far as Marrakesh as a city is concerned it is very hot and busy and the only aspect that put me off was the high pressure sales people in the streets and market. But go with this in mind and you can have some fun too haggling with them! If you don't like haggling and pressure the hotel pointed us to a HUGE emporium of everything literally a few yards from the hotel where you won't receive any pressure - pick a rainy day though (if you get one) because you will spend a long time browsing the three floors of this Aladin's cave!,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/graemeg255

La Sultana Marrakech,Eric G wrote a review Sep 2012,50,Fantastic Escape!!,My partner and I recently spent 4 days at La Sultana during a week long trip to Morocco. The hotel is an oasis in the middle of the absolutely crazy Medina in Marrakesh. This is one of the nicest hotels we've stayed in anywhere. We stayed in a Deluxe suite which was very large and decorated beautifully and the pool area and roof deck are gorgeous places to hang out during your stay. All of the staff were extremely attentive and handled our every need from arranging a tour guide to a day excursion to sending out my sandals which had broken and having them back repaired in less than 24 hours. The spa is also very beautiful but it's overpriced for what you get. I enjoyed the traditional hammam bath but could have skipped the massages for that price  which is very high. I would highly recommend this hotel if you are interested in having a luxury hotel experience while also having an authentic Moroccan one.,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EricG358

La Sultana Marrakech,turkiyem wrote a review Aug 2012,50,Splendid service,This place was an oasis of generosity and calm for me after a complicated start to my morocco trip where my accommodation fell through at the airport. After hours at the airport in extreme heat Nadia was very empathic and sweet and patient with me in my flustered and disorganised state. She helped me book a room and generously took time to give me clear and useful directions to get to the hotel. A big fat thankyou to our dear and genteel afternoon front desk person Khalid who followed through with our requests and bent over backwards to assist us with our every whim over our 2 day stay. He even preempted my wishes before I even made a request. Mohammed at the front desk was also jusy lovely and generous with his time assisting in arranging our forwarding itinerary.  Yes there are some hotel flaws - the rooms are dark but each riad we have seen since have often been dark - i think this is mostly an architectural aspect of the riad. And yes the food at dinner was pretty plain but who cares when the service is SO GOOD andq there are plenty of restaurants nearby if you are more particular about the quality of your food.,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Sydney, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/turkiyem

And the swimming pool is an excellent feature (although we think thought that 7:00pm was too early for it to close).    Second the staff is just phenomenal. The service was just great. We really couldn't want for anything from them.    The food was very good... standard Moroccan with some European dishes mixed in. You wouldn't go wrong if you decided to stay at the Riad for dinner. The breakfast was excellent as well with many choices and quick effiecient service. We ate lunch a few times there are as well and although the menu was a bit limited everything we had was very good.    Our room was top notch and the air conditioning worked very well (an important feature for June in Marrakech!).    The Riad is a bit pricy but I never once felt like we made a bad choice or that the cost wasn't worth it. We really enjoyed our stay and were a bit sad to leave.

La Sultana Marrakech,Emma A wrote a review Jun 2012,50,Stunning.,Our first time in Morocco... I splashed out a little on the hotel and hoped it would be worth it I was NOT disappointed.    As soon as we entered the street our bags were whisked away so we didn't have to lug them around we were escorted into a comfortable lounge to check in that was complete with fresh pastries and mint tea for us. They could not have possibly done more for us we were  Graded and received a voucher for a spa treatment free. We got a full tour of the five stunning riads that make up the hotel (each has a different style) and were shown everything we could possibly need to know. Soft drinks are complimentary and wifi is on the house too. We were told that during our day this is our home and it actually feels that way.    Service is impeccable everyone is smartly dressed. Everyday we have fresh rose petals placed on our new sheets and towels and the air con is a life saver in this heat!    The evening meal was beautiful (although expensive) and we didn't mind paying. I had scallops king prawn and ginger curry while my partner had a fillet steak and it was delicious. We were served tomato and mozzarella prior to this with tomato bread which was equally as yummy.    This hotel urged me to join trip advisor to write this review as it is truly unforgettable.

La Sultana Marrakech,Paul T wrote a review Jun 2012,50,Second Visit,"We enjoyed our 7 night stay here so much last June that we were determined to return this year (we combined it with 4 nights at the unforgettable La Sultana Oualidia). Normally when you return to a place it never seems to capture the initial experience however La Sultana Marrakech is quite exceptional in every way and sheer beauty of the place grips you immediately. Saida (the manager) remembered us from last year and she really made us feel at home as did all of the same charming staff.  Once inside the old city walls Marrakech really is a ""full on"" experience think Indiana Jones and double it! The porters will be expecting you and they will be waiting to transport your bags up the tiny street to the hotel entrance once inside all is calming and tranquil the tinkling of the water fountains adding to the ambience. Delicious traditional Morrocan pastries and mint tea help you unwind.  Since we were splitting our 3 nights in Marrakech either side of the 4 nights in Oualidia we had 2 different rooms and all I can say is that the rooms are simply stunning (we stayed in Jaguar and Elephant) on the Africa floor (Zebra last year) each with a private balcony over the pool courtyard. La Sultana is a photographers paradise with so many details to capture what you see on the web-site is only scratching the surface of this incredible place.  Saida and her staff are always ready to help with any reservations or advice and they will make your stay an unforgettable experience. A charming taxi driver called Adelmoula (the hotel have his number) who speakes excellent English offered to show us some sights in the old part of Marrakech we hadn't seen before it was amazing. He took us to many places including The Museum of Islamic Scool of Music a bakers who bakes bread the way it has been done for thousands of years and a place where men shovel saw-dust into a furnace to heat hammams. He is very reasonable (cheap!).  Both breakfast and dinner are delicious pleasures at La Sultana and the settings are so romantic you will never want to leave the hotel but staff will make suggestions and bookings and lay on the transport for you. One night I left it to Sadia and she arranged a taxi which took us into the centre (5 minutes) where we transferred to a horse and cart for a short ride through the square to a recomended restuarant.

La Sultana Marrakech,cristeena wrote a review Jun 2012,50,1001 nights,"This hotel is gorgeous.  It was my first time in Marrakech and wanted to stay somewhere where it felt like Morocco.  La Sultana was perfect. The decoration is proper Moroccan. It's magical. This hotel is a place to see. It's like a museum!    The staff was very nice the atmosphere was amazing especially at night while having dinner. There is a man playing the ""guitar"" (Moroccan type of instrument) and singing. It's stunning.  The roof terrace is super nice especially under the stars!    The spa is good had a proper hammam and felt really clean!    The hotel is situated in the Medina so be ready to get hit by the ""real thing"" when you exit the door of hotel. It can be pretty hard to go out to reality. It was quite a shock for me the first day because I wasn't expecting all of this chaos. So it was always a pleasure/relief when I was back in the hotel.    If I had to go back to Marrakech I'd stay there again. I'd just take a bigger room because they might feel a bit claustrophobic to some people. The hotel is built around different courtyards meaning your windows face the courtyards and might not give enough light. I'd definitely go for a room on the 1st floor.",Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled on business,Londinium,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cristeena
La Sultana Marrakech,Greg P wrote a review Jun 2012,50,So good that I registered to this site to spread the word...,I think the true test of a good hotel is not necessarily in its successes but how it deals with its mistakes or failures (no hotel is perfect after all). This hotel was truly beautiful and offered really great service but it truly distinguished itself with how it dealt with one of its mistakes (more on that at the end).    I stayed at La Sultana with my partner for a quick romantic getaway and we were drawn by the reviews on this site. They did not disappoint...we have had an amazing stay.  The roof terrace (where they take you for your check-in - inc. mint tea and lovely Moroccan pastries) was like a small paradise. Palm trees wicker chairs in the shade loungers with parasols (needed in June!) a plunge pool and a very helpful and attentive staff. In the heat of the afternoon there are misters under the gazebo spraying quietly to keep you cool. The pool in the courtyard was absolute tranquillity and lovely in the heat of Moroccan summer. We made excellent use of their Spa (a little expensive but well worth the top-class treatments) and would HIGHLY recommend a four-handed massage and a traditional hammam!    The Restaurant was lovely (we made a point to eat out on most nights but for our last dinner we couldn't resist the La Sultana tasting menu!) and the setting is truly perfect - up on the roof terrace with the musician and the adhan serenading you...it felt a little too good to be true at times! Breakfast was great and can be brought to your room at no extra cost.    As mentioned the worst part of our stay was the excursion to the Ourika Valley (including visiting a traditional Berber village) which the hotel arranged for us. This trip just went all wrong from the very start. The 'driver' / 'guide' could not speak English or French and he stalled our 4x4 several times (not giving us a great feeling of security as he drove along some VERY precarious roads in the High Atlas). He stopped at several unscheduled places (usually friends of his who tried to sell us things) and he didn't make any effort to speak to us or explain anything. To top it all off he took us to a restaurant for lunch which was FOUL! We both became ill as a result and could not go out the next day.    So why have I given La Sultana 5 stars despite this? Because I am willing to accept that this was caused by a bad tour agency and that the Hotel will not let this happen again. When we returned to the hotel and told them of our 'adventure' their reaction was admirable. Almost immediately afterwards the desk manager came to find us and apologised unreservedly. She offered an explanation made no excuses refunded the cost and offered another day trip gratis as compensation. We could not unfortunately take her up on the kind offer as we only had 1 more day in the country but even then she offered us a free guide to take us around Marrakech. I am sure if we had been able to stay at La Sultana any longer they would have more than compensated for this error made by the outside agency they used but perhaps this will have to wait until next time.    I can't say for sure if we will be returning to Marrakech but I can definitely say that if I do I would be staying at La Sultana.    Top Pros:  - Excellent staff who bend over backwards;  - stunning roof-top terrace and swimming pool; and  - great location.    Top Cons:  - Room was a little dark;  - pretty pricey (but they do offer a lot of freebies!); and  - the excursion (maybe source this yourself with a reputable company).,Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GregP88
La Sultana Marrakech,sjstocker wrote a review Jun 2012,50,Hidden gem - perfect for a romantic getaway,We stayed at La Sultana for 5 nights from 4 June 2012. We were really impressed by the quality of the hotel and the decor in particular is just divine. We visited a number of the other hotels in Marrakech for dinner and La Sultana was by far the best we saw. The location is also perfect for visiting the sites of Marrakech and you feel completely protected from the hustle and bustle of the city going on around you.    Having seen the layout of the hotel I think in hindsight we would have asked for a room with as much light as possible. Our room was lovely and there are great little things like dates on the pillow and free soft drinks from the mini-bar that add those little touches to make a stay even better. However it was very very dark - there was one very small dark stained glass window which looked out onto a corridor which meant that in reality there is no natural light at all and I had a lot of trouble waking up in the morning. Having looked at the website again though it does warn you of this and tells you to mention it at the time of booking if you would like a room with natural light.    The hotel staff were very pleasant and courteous and always wanted to help any way they could. We ate dinner there on two nights and both nights asked for our tea to be brought to the room which they were happy to do. Saaida the general manager in particular deserves a special mention for being lovely and friendly. Everything was easy taxi's were arranged dinners booked and we were even checked in on the terrace with mint tea and a welcome tray of morrocan pastries.    We ate at the hotel three times twice for dinner (once the a la carte and once the tasting menu) and once for lunch. The tasting menu was absolutely divine and didn't suffer from the problem a lot of Marrakech seems to have which is to provide you with so much food it's wasteful and you cannot possibly finish. Other than that I think the dishes are a bit hit and miss. The lunch was perfectly nice and very tasty food and our starter of Morrocan salads from the a la carte was also by far the best we had with delicate spiced flavours. Unfortunately what let it down was the lamb couscous dish which I had on the first night. The lamb was by far the worst quality I had anywhere in Marrakech and was on a giant bed of flavourless couscous with a jug of some sort of stock which was supposed to be used as a sauce to provide flavour. The whole dish was a disaster and it was a real shame as everything else we ate at La Sultana was amongst the nicest food we had on the trip however the lamb dish sticks in my mind as the worst thing I ate. I would still recommend the food though and would definitely tell people to go for dinner on the beautiful terrace (avoiding the lamb dish!).    Unfortunately we arranged a tour through the hotel which did not go to plan and which we were very disappointed with and when we arrived back from the tour we did complain. Their response could not have been better they phoned the agency they use to establish what had gone wrong didn't charge us for the tour and offered us a chance to take another tour. Unfortunately we couldn't take them up on this as we were short on time but their response was really fantastic and I think in the circumstances they did everything they possibly could to compensate for the bad experience (even though it wasn't really their fault but the agency they book the tours through).,Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sjstocker

La Sultana Marrakech,juleroo wrote a review Jun 2012,40,beautiful hidden palace,This is a lovely place as with most here the charm is well hidden behind a huge door in the corner of a bustling market. The central courtyard is beautiful you can breakfast or dine here beneath the palms. The food and service very good. The rooms are dark and cozy beautifully furnished and comfortable but definitely an AliBaba cave feel everything is oriented toward the interiors. I prefer light and openness so I would not plan a long stay. Bathrobes and Sultana toiletries are nice touches in the modern comfortable bathroom though even here we were told NOT to use the water for tooth-brushing or drinking. Really DONT it;s just how things are in Morocco even in the nicest hotel apparently. Nice touches like a book closet where you can help yourself to volumes left behind by others and leave one behind in return. The rooftop bar is magical and you can dine and watch the world go by in the streets below. A small gift shop with luxurious things too. Staff on the whole helpful but small front desk which can get a little overloaded on checkout - allow plenty of time.,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"atlantic beach, florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juleroo

La Sultana Marrakech,Enrico S wrote a review Mar 2012,40,Unique setting in the middle of the Kasbah...with few weak points,As a preamble i do stand by my title. It has been my first time in Morocco and Marrakech the Riad is in a great setting smack in the middle of a bustling area where few tourists go apart from the nearby Saadi's Tombs. Is enormously silent and quiet so if relax is what you are looking for than look no further.    At the same time as a seasoned traveller i have to point out few things that didn't quite worked so that the charming Xavier (Manager) might find how to fix it.    Roof restaurant    On our second from last day we came back quite late (3:30pm) to the Riad and asked if we could still eat. a nice asian lady told us 'certainly at the roof top restaurant'. we headed there and the table was been prepared for us. we were told no grill would have been available because of the late hour but anything else would. we therefore ordered two tagines of which we made a real diet during our stay. we ordered two sides of rice as well. my tagine arrived cold no rice. i asked for it to be heated up but i wasn't happy. after having being treated to so many good meals a cold tagine was a real disappointment. i reminded the waiter of our rices and i finally got one quite frankly unedible.    my point is if reception knows it's late please don't send clients to the restaurant for them to be treated like this. i am sure this will be corrected    Femme de chambre / cleaners    We stayed 5 nights. everyday the room clening was a surprise in itself. one day there were no liners in the bins. another there were liners but no pillow cases. a third there were pillow cases and liners but no hand towels...i mean come on!    SPA    We went once and we tried a relaxing massage side by side. if you have tried massages in Thailand then do not go.    Spa is in the lower ground and welcomes you with a beautiful marble pool. unfortunately the water is cold and having a jacuzzi cold is not my idea of jacuzzi.    Excursions    we spent a whole day with Assan and a private car. we were told it would have been a 4x4 and it wasn't but it was still a great day out in the Atlas Valley. Assan is a great guy and clearly knows his trades. strongly recommend.    Language    If people think all moroccans speak english and french please reconsider. the cleaning staff doesn't and their french is not the french we are taught in europe. it will require extreme patience when ordering room service and dealing with staff in general. it's the way it is and there is nothing anybody can do. just be warned.    Lounge bar    La Sultana has a lounge bar designed as a transatlantic bar. one evening we spent 15' there hoping to have a tea. noboby ever showed up and we left...    MARRAKECH    Marrakech taxis    Main mean of transport for us. they will never use the meter and if asked might even get angry. apart from this they are very friendly and at the end of the day cheap so it's an acceptable flaw.    Main Square    If i were you i would avoid it. it's a tourist trap with terrible food on sale in nearby restaurants. rather go to the huge souk that starts from its back.    Conclusion    I loved Marrakech and La Sultana. i think we overstayed and maube a shorter stay would have been enough. The Riad is great and has fantastic design.    hope it helps.,Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/137enricos
La Sultana Marrakech,Janraso wrote a review Mar 2012,50,Wonderful experience,La Sultana Marrakech is maybe one of the best hotels I have ever been. To start they don't make you stand in the reception but they offer you to seat in one of the wonderful patios and they do all the check in there while they offer you a delicious mint tea with traditional sweets! Then they guide you through the hotel. This is the way to start a unique experience!!! I was travelling with my partner and we felt all the time very welcomed. We are now in love with the hotel.    La Sultana it's based on 5 different riads but which all make a singular and unique building very stylishly decorated. The have (I'm sure) the best terrace in Marrakech! with views to la Kasbha or Koutoubia mosques to the Atlas to the Saadian tombs.... It's an amazing experience to have a drink for the sunset.The rooms are splendid full of comfort and amenities.    The room service the reception and restaurant staff are highly professional they are always friendly they get all what you want (specially appreciated are the honest taxi drivers!!!). Maybe some of the waiters of the terrace could be a bit quicker... but is it really important when we are on vacation and we have great views?    It's not a hotel in the Ville Nouvelle it's in the Medina - so of course the streets are a bit messy. However it must be said that around the Kashba mosque the area has been renovated and cleaned. From inside La Sultana we get no sounds from the streets.    To sum up: La Sultana is maybe the best hotel in Marrakech. It's expensive (and really the access to the spa could be included....) but it does live up to the expectations! I 100% recommend the hotel.,Date of stay: February 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Barcelona, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Janraso

La Sultana Marrakech,Lucyr862 wrote a review Feb 2012,50,Just Perfect!,If you are looking at the Sultana then think no further - just book it! It is just the most wonderful oasis in the heart of the Medina. The architecture is just fabulous and the attention to details is just wonderful. There are 5 riads all joined together but each with a different theme. There are so many different areas to sit that you will not be bumping into any other guests. The rooms are all wonderful. We started off in the least expensive - but it was absolutely gorgeous. There is NO 'basic' room in this hotel! The only thing I would have added to the room was a docking station. For our last night the hotel manageress insisted on upgrading us because of a comment we had made (it was not a big problem but in the mornings we could hear the cleaners on terrace above us). We were moved to a Deluxe Suite - wow!!! I think we could have had about 6 of us in the bed it was so large! All the rooms have their own theme and each one is different. We also used the spa - absolutely recommend the Hammam - I don't think I have ever been so clean. We also dined at the hotel every night as the food and the service was really great and just delightful in the soft lighting.  I really can't think of a negative to say about this hotel - just book it!  Many thanks to all the staff who made our time so special.

My husband had an accident which involved an overnight stay in hospital and without the help from Saida in La Sultana we would have found the experience very difficult.  I enjoyed the experience of making lamb tagine one morning and then eating the results for lunch!

I was there with a friend (2 ladies) we booked another small road where we stayed 3 nights and for the last night we gave ourselves a thread for a 1 night stay at La Sultana. Anyway whenever I would go back to Marrakech I would go back to this place. In the evening we had dinner next to the swimming pool with some nice musicians next to the pool food was excellent.

La Sultana Marrakech,Little_World2012 wrote a review Feb 2012,40,Unexpected oasis with a few remarks,Very quiet inside the property (although located on a very busy area). There is a short strow -pedestrians only - from the street to the hotel entrace that was not very nice with construction works going on and quite dirty that the hotel itself could have taken care of cleaning. Also there was no internet connection in our room. The concierge service was amazing! Very attentive and much better than the cleaning staff that was pretty intrusive and lacked trainning. I believe they are working on getting it all on track and would definetely recomend the hotel.

A very friendly staff helped us in a great way with anything we asked for.    My wife and I stayed here to participate in the Marrakech Marathon. (Which we also reccomend!) The hotel is really great and i reccomend it to anyone coming to Marrakech. After a day haggling and constantly finding yourself surrounded by people this is a great place to kick back.

La Sultana Marrakech,Glindaba wrote a review Jan 2012,50,Calm in the Casbah,Hidden in the middle of the Casbah within the walled Medina La Sultana is in fact five “riads” converted into one property. Interconnected by a series of corridors and stairways each riad has been individually designed and furnished in a highly eclectic and most comfortable style. Rooms look inward (as is the Morrocan tradition) to beautiful courtyards and some on the upper level have balconies. In high season (or when the hotel is fully occupied) there could be a feeling of being “overlooked” but this is a small price to pay for the degree of calm La Sultana provides in the midst of the bustle which is Marrakech. The roof-top terrace has views over the Casbah and Medina.  Our Deluxe Suite had three spacious well appointed areas - living room bedroom and bathroom; free soft drinks in the mini-bar comfortable bed i-pod docking station flat screen TV twin-sinks in the bathroom corner Jacuzzi-style bath and walk-in shower (door/screen would be nice so as to control overflow!)  The staff are remarkable; they achieve the impossible by being there when required and discreet as necessary. Service is superb. Breakfast looks modest but is in fact a feast with breads cold cuts and cheeses supplemented by delicious local delicacies cooked on demand with the most amazing date milk and the freshest fruit juices and is served overlooking the small pool. The camel is a nice touch! Dinner is also served here and has the additional charm of having a musician playing in the background. The food was great and service is second to none. Dine here even if you are not a resident guest.  La Sultana is a luxury retreat an oasis of tranquillity and provides a welcome traditional and different alternative to the big hotel groups. You feel as though you are in a different world enhanced by the service given throughout this beautiful riad.,Date of stay: January 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Glindaba

La Sultana Marrakech,TravelingCoconut wrote a review Jan 2012,30,Not quite as good as we expected,La Sultana initially didn't quite satisfy our (high) expectations and in the end I don't think we'll return.    We had looked at the pictures on the website and expected something in a similar style (simple and elegant white walls) yet were given the Ibis room which was simply quite ugly to us: yellow-orange walls with blue curtains and no natural light except for yellow and blue stained glass windows high up on one side of the room. The bathroom was a bit of an oddity with a bathtub that was fit for a small child at the end of a little passage but it looked nice enough.    When we asked if for a shisha (waterpipe) the first night on the roof terrace we spent ten minutes smoking on a chilly terrace to be charged 35 euros. We were also told that that charge had to be in cash and could not be part of our extras so it felt like even in our hotel we had to be aware of being ripped off. By then we got into a bad mood and decided to complain about the room we were given (being so different from what we had seen on the Sultana website). Our last and fourth night we were given an upgrade which made up for these discomforts to an extent (better to have had no discomforts in the first place).    Be aware also of the prices in the spa where a half-hour massage is 50 euros and the only free thing available is the jacuzzi which we tried out and was crowded.    We did enjoy the morroccan cooking course but again 80 euros per person seemed a bit extravagant.    Disregarding the prices the hotel was good but didn't blow us away. Good food and service but nothing amazing.,Date of stay: December 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingCoconut

La Sultana Marrakech,Reese L wrote a review Nov 2011,50,My favorite hotel stay...ever.,"Although a fairely regular user of tripadvisor.com I don't typically take the time to comment on my stay at particular hotels. Most of the time the stay is ""fine"" so I don't bother to highlight anything in particular. Our most recent stay at La Sultana however is worthy of note.    We have traveled extensively around the world for both business and pleasure. As a result we have experienced a very wide range of accommodations from the lowliest hostel-style bare bones rooms to the finest five-star resorts. La Sultana stands out among all the great hotels of the world that we've visited.    From the moment we arrived in reception to the moment we departed for the airport at the end of our stay we were struck by the incredible level of service we received. Beyond the truly magnificent architecture and interior design details of La Sultana the staff rates among the best we've ever encountered. Hassan and Saida (I hope I spelled their names correctly!) in particular were gracious accommodating and unflappable as we peppered them with typical tourist questions as well as several special requests designed to accommodate our limited schedule in Marrakech.    By the end of our stay our discussion had turned from ""Where do we want to go next?"" to ""How soon could we arrange to come back?"" La Sultana offered everything we look for and more. In short we would highly recommend this property to anyone anytime.    To the skeptical (or jaded) traveler I say ""You won't be disappointed."" To the excellent staff of La Sultana I say ""Well done....and thank you! We will see you again!""

Away from the dust and maddening touts La Sultana is a peaceful oasis where the beauty of the furnishing and riads can be appreciated close up. Consisting of five riads all the rooms are exquisitely furnished down to the littlest detail.    Not to miss is the lone musician strumming his exotic moroccan instrument and singing by the pool in the evenings. The luminescent pool lights and the traditional brick ceilings provide a very surreal atmosphere and immediately transports the listeners to the old Marrakech.

La Sultana Marrakech,Auntsandra wrote a review Sep 2011,50,A fantasy made into reality,La Sultana is a fantasy made in to a reality. The hotel consists of five connecting riads each with a different decorative theme. We stayed in the Camel Suite on the first floor.  Upon walking through the front door of the hotel you are immediately struck by the peace and serenity of the place. The reception staff greet you with real warmth and friendliness. Khalid who signed us in and not by way the way on reception but in a beautiful room off one of the many courtyards was friendly informative and professional.  Our room was spacious and again beautifully decorated. Everywhere was spotlessly clean. The roof terrace where we took our meals was again beautiful There were plenty of sun loungers and seating on the terrace. The small plunge pool was small but it was a plunge pool not a swimming pool. From the roof terrace you could look down on the market outside the hotel. The calm of the hotel seemed a different world away from the street.  The food was excellent and well presented and the service exceptional. The waiter Said who we saw most off was friendly and attentive and it was a pleasure to meet him.  The swimming pool was quiet and perhaps we were lucky for we only saw two other people around the pool whilst we were there.  The service and attention to detail was excellent the rose petals in the bathroom for example and I would certainly recommend this hotel.,Date of stay: September 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bath, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Auntsandra

To date these have been our favorite hotel experiences but coming away from Morroco (I am on the plane as I type!) we feel that La Sultana Marrakech has surpassed all of them.    This hotel is like an Alladin's cave full of treasure! The architecture is stunning and the furnishings palatial. But the jewel in this crown is the unbelievable level of attention and service offered by every member of staff. Saida says 'welcome home' as you come through the door - at first it might seem like a presentation for the cynical Englishman. But after staying a few days you realise that they really mean it!

This all added to the excitment of the holiday and did not cause any problems regarding food or service etc.  La Sultana was a true sanctuary in what can only be described as the madness of Marrakesh! After some very interesting visits to palaces and the souks to come back to La Sultana and enjoy our lovely air conditioned room fantastic service and great food was heaven on earth!  We were given excellent advice on restaurants and trips by Mohammed in reception and enjoyed chatting with waiters in the restaurant. Although if you don't want to chat they are the most descreet and accommodating staff we have ever come across. We ate several lunches and a couple of dinners at the retaurant everything from traditional Morroccan to club sandwich all fantastic.  We can recommend the excursion to Kasbah de Toubkal - which is a stunning hotel retreat in the foothills of the Atlas mountains - a great day trip to see a different side of Marrakesh! Although if you are not at least moderately fit - take the option of the mule - fun and a lot easier to breath at this altitude! This was all arranged by the hotel for us even though we did not make up our minds to go until 10pm the night before!

La Sultana Marrakech,ve r wrote a review Sep 2011,50,wonderful design and service,La Sultana is the most lovely riad in Marrakech. Prior to first arrival to the door it is very unsettling as i learned most of Marrakech is. Once inside the doors past the pre- reception front desk it all changes you are transported to a place you dont want to leave. Wonderful design in this Riad  it is world class. The rooms are amazing and like out of a movie. Each one is unique and most have some sort of soaking tub and an internal courtyard balcony.  We were there early and midweek and several rooms were empty so i got to peak in. We had a suite that was very spacious. The first thing i did was crack the champagne and take a long bath in the sunken round tub. Complementary soft drinks water  fresh fruit and pistachios were refreshed throughout our stay.  The restaurant is open for all meals and the best thing is eating on the roof top here there is a bar and small plunge pool.  The spa is nicely decorated and soaking pool is amazing but the massage rooms and massage was noisy and average. Stick with the hamams.    I was glad we stayed at this beautiful one of a kind riad. If i return to Marrakech in future i will consider returning here. The service was fantastic and the beauty of design were top reasons. You need a convenient and top quality place to come back to after experiencing the chaos of old Marrakech. This one is close to the walls of the city and very easy to get to the new city just outside if you need a break. We had friends on the same trip and they were exhausted just getting back to their Riad everyday because of its location.

La Sultana Marrakech,gdonoghue wrote a review Sep 2011,50,A Stunning Hotel with exceptional service..,Just returned home after 4 days at this Hotel and from the moment we stepped foot inside to the moment we said goodbye we loved it. This hotel is made up of 4/5 Raids that have been decorated to the highest standard. Each Raid has a slightly different feel but all to a high standard. When you walk into the main reception area from the chaos on the street its like an oasis of beauty. We took the transfer from the airport which I recommend as the hotel is not easy to find its about 150 dhm more than a local taxis but worth it. When we arrived we were seated in a stunning room and given fresh mint team and local pastries while the front desk checked us in. We arrived at 10am and the room was not officially ready until 3pm however after some drinks on the roof terrace we were shown to our room at 11:45. The hotel had upgraded is to a suite deluxe with balcony overlooking the pool the Giraffe room. A lovely room everything you need and the balcony was great. We ate in the roof terrace most nights as the food and service was excellent. The sweets are the best the chef specialism is great puddings. The service was excellent at all meal times breakfast was simple but enough choice and the staff would more or less make anything for you. They often referred to the hotel as a home and guest should treat it that way We had a complementary Hammam scrub in the SPA as we are SLH.com members We loved it and regretted not going for more treatments as its was reasonably priced.    Overall this was a great break a stunning hotel and the service was first class. The management were always around helping and took a real interest to ensure the guests felt at home.    We plan to go back and maybe try the other hotel in the group.    Try the tasting menu and the Moroccan pancakes for breakfast. The rooftop plunge is great to cool off in and let me know if you ever see anyone in the gym we did not... The free non-alcohol in the room is a nice touch as is the internet access and ipod dock.,Date of stay: August 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Manchester,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gdonoghue

La Sultana Marrakech,Katie N wrote a review Aug 2011,30,"Very Nice Hotel, But I Don't Think I'd Go Back","My sixteen year old son and I stayed at La Sultana last December for a week and found it to be a beautiful and fascinating hotel although a bit different than what we expected. It was quite difficult to get to by car and by foot because the entire area in front of the hotel had been reduced to impassible rubble by some kind of road construction. We had rented a car and literally spent hours just trying to find the place then weren't able to get the car (and our luggage) anywhere near the hotel itself - THEN were told that we had better move our car or we would be getting a very expensive ticket. Ugh. Hardly the reception one expects at ""The Small Luxury Hotels of World"".    Each of the room is set up around a central square ""medina"" style. I had booked a large room (not the cheapest room not the most expensive as I recall). Well when they put us in our room it had shuttered windows that opened up onto the pool/restaurant area and was about 10 feet by 7 feet. People in the pool/restaurant smoke quite a bit so there was constant smoke coming in the room through the shutters - not to mention that the room was dark (because it was either smoky and light and no privacy or dark and a bit smoky).  So it was not a great situation.    By the second night they moved our room but by then I really felt like the whole trip was tainted by my complaining about this and that. And you know the hotel is quite expensive it should have just been great from the beginning.

La Sultana Marrakech,Serial_Traveller wrote a review Aug 2011,30,Hit and Miss.,The beauty of the intimate riads in Morocco is that you so often feel like you are staying in someone's home rather than a faceless hotel. I have had the good fortune to stay in several riads in Morocco and I do have an absolute favourite but I still like to try other riads for a few nights before returning to my No1. On this trip I decided to start my trip with a stay at La Sultana as many people rate it the best riad in Marrakech - so I had very high expectations. Upon making my reservation I noted a small detail - La Sultana  charge to collect you at the airport - no other riad has ever done so. Plus La  Sultana is possibly the most expensive riad there is and take a 50% deposit up front.    Anyway I went ahead with my booking - was collected at the airport - and without doubt upon arrival at the riad and being shown around it is a beautiful riad full of artisnal  handiwork (though I have stayed at riads more immaginativley and creatively decorated which I have been featured in books or magazines such as World of Interiors). But for me there the experience ended. My suite certainly lacked any wow-factor and verged on the very ordinary and uninspiring.    The riad has a very nice enclosed pool area but even in low season and with low occupancy there can easily be a race to get a sun lounger and it can feel claustrophobic - I absolutely hate to think what it would be like in high season (though in fairness that must be the same with most of the riads). Of course there are plenty of other places to sit especially on the roof but everyone wants to be by the pool. I have read some reviews which mention the wonderful roof top pool - let's tell the truth it is the size of a large bathtub but longer. It's unlikely you would want to share it with a stranger.  Sadly our relaxation by the pool - every day - was marred by one man who seemed to think it perfectly acceptable to have his music playing on his ipad and ruined the peace and tranquility. Further due to the influx of rich Russians who are now travelling to all the hot spots but have yet to learn any social etiquette grace or respectful manners when in the company of others they seem to think it acceptable to shout the whole day across the pool or courtyards to each other. Riads are supposed to be a place of tranquility NOT a theme park!    Over all I felt like La sultana was more like a hotel than an intimate riad. There were certainly none of the typical little luxuries of many other riads such as laying on a free afternoon tea (not even free Morrocan mint tea which you get just about everywhre) or a free laundry service. Plus housekeeping were very good at taking things away but not replacing them. Certainly breakfast was an absolute shambles every morning - can we have napkins? butter? cutlery? preserves? And not one decent coffee or tea during our whole stay depite repeatedly asking for very hot water - plus at this riad's prices I expect some good loose leaf tea in a pot not an inferior brand tea bag on a saucer with a luke warm pot of water. So the bottom line is that I still have my No1 riad and I wouldn't stay at La Sultana again and I definitely wouldn't recommend it to any friends. The riad itself is beautiful (as is the spa) but the rest is just perfunctory and offers a very hit-or-miss service. But credit where it's due Mayumi and Khalib on reception are excellent and a couple of the younger staff who serve dinner in the evenings on the terrace have that magic smile and twinkle which is found more in abundance in other riads but that's about it.    Sadly I suspect I shall remember La Sultana for the wrong reasons rather than the good ones and I have to ask why is this one of the most expensive riads in Marrakech which offers so little to justify the price? I am only left with one question when reading many of the posted reviews of La Sultana that speak of it in glowing terms and that is have you stayed at any other riads in Morrocco for comparison? If this had been my first riad stay and I had nothing to compare with then I probably would have been impressed. But I am only too aware there are other riads that give you a far better service and treat you to a far better Morrocan experience and good hospitality and are cheaper to stay at.,Date of stay: July 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Serial_Traveller

I dont usually write reviews but I thought for this I just had to recommend!    As soon as we arrived at the hotel we were greatly welcomed by the staff who gave us a highly personalised service by showing us around the riad (my boyfriend and I were speechless as to how beautiful it was-the pictures are lovely but it is even better in real life) we were also given traditional mint tea and pastries on arrival and shown to our room which was very large with a beautiful bathroom coated with pink rose petals.    We arrived in the evening so thought we should sample the restaurant as it was a stunning setting around the pool and a man played the mandolin whilst we ate. This was a fantastic experience and the waiters were so keen to please.    The riad is also in the perfect location only a ten minute walk from the main market and right in the middle of the Medina and the action.    The swimming pool is beautiful and you can even go on the terrace to sunbath.  There is also a complimentary mini bar (bar alcohol) which was a nice touch.    We also did an excursion to the Atlas Mountains which we organised with the riad on our arrival. It was a lovely change to the hustle of Marrakech and is really worth doing to see the berber culture. We went to Ourika Valley and visited an Argan oil workshop and then were taken to Richard Branson's Morrocan Retreat for lunch which was also beautiful.

La Sultana Marrakech,Serial_Traveller wrote a review Aug 2011,30,Hit and Miss.,The beauty of the intimate riads in Morocco is that you so often feel like you are staying in someone's home rather than a faceless hotel. I have had the good fortune to stay in several riads in Morocco and I do have an absolute favourite but I still like to try other riads for a few nights before returning to my No1. On this trip I decided to start my trip with a stay at La Sultana as many people rate it the best riad in Marrakech - so I had very high expectations. Upon making my reservation I noted a small detail - La Sultana  charge to collect you at the airport - no other riad has ever done so. Plus La  Sultana is possibly the most expensive riad there is and take a 50% deposit up front.    Anyway I went ahead with my booking - was collected at the airport - and without doubt upon arrival at the riad and being shown around it is a beautiful riad full of artisnal  handiwork (though I have stayed at riads more immaginativley and creatively decorated which I have been featured in books or magazines such as World of Interiors). But for me there the experience ended. My suite certainly lacked any wow-factor and verged on the very ordinary and uninspiring.    The riad has a very nice enclosed pool area but even in low season and with low occupancy there can easily be a race to get a sun lounger and it can feel claustrophobic - I absolutely hate to think what it would be like in high season (though in fairness that must be the same with most of the riads). Of course there are plenty of other places to sit especially on the roof but everyone wants to be by the pool. I have read some reviews which mention the wonderful roof top pool - let's tell the truth it is the size of a large bathtub but longer. It's unlikely you would want to share it with a stranger.  Sadly our relaxation by the pool - every day - was marred by one man who seemed to think it perfectly acceptable to have his music playing on his ipad and ruined the peace and tranquility. Further due to the influx of rich Russians who are now travelling to all the hot spots but have yet to learn any social etiquette grace or respectful manners when in the company of others they seem to think it acceptable to shout the whole day across the pool or courtyards to each other. Riads are supposed to be a place of tranquility NOT a theme park!    Over all I felt like La sultana was more like a hotel than an intimate riad. There were certainly none of the typical little luxuries of many other riads such as laying on a free afternoon tea (not even free Morrocan mint tea which you get just about everywhre) or a free laundry service. Plus housekeeping were very good at taking things away but not replacing them. Certainly breakfast was an absolute shambles every morning - can we have napkins? butter? cutlery? preserves? And not one decent coffee or tea during our whole stay depite repeatedly asking for very hot water - plus at this riad's prices I expect some good loose leaf tea in a pot not an inferior brand tea bag on a saucer with a luke warm pot of water. So the bottom line is that I still have my No1 riad and I wouldn't stay at La Sultana again and I definitely wouldn't recommend it to any friends. The riad itself is beautiful (as is the spa) but the rest is just perfunctory and offers a very hit-or-miss service. But credit where it's due Mayumi and Khalib on reception are excellent and a couple of the younger staff who serve dinner in the evenings on the terrace have that magic smile and twinkle which is found more in abundance in other riads but that's about it.    Sadly I suspect I shall remember La Sultana for the wrong reasons rather than the good ones and I have to ask why is this one of the most expensive riads in Marrakech which offers so little to justify the price? I am only left with one question when reading many of the posted reviews of La Sultana that speak of it in glowing terms and that is have you stayed at any other riads in Morrocco for comparison? If this had been my first riad stay and I had nothing to compare with then I probably would have been impressed. But I am only too aware there are other riads that give you a far better service and treat you to a far better Morrocan experience and good hospitality and are cheaper to stay at.,Date of stay: July 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Serial_Traveller

What a beautiful magical country.  We stayed at La Sultanta beginning of July 2011 for one week and La Sultana was the ideal Riad its location within the Medina walls was easy walking distance to the Souks at the Place Jenna el Fna and attractions. The rooms the decor and the service were excellent we experienced no problems whatsoever. We enjoyed a day at the La Sultana Spa experiencing for the first time a Hamman which was relaxing nothing was too much trouble.  The meals were first class and whatever was requested was provided it was the little touches that made La Sultana special.  We had a wonderful stay and the staff could not be more helpful and welcoming. La Sultana was as magical as the country.  I would recommend La Sultanta to anyone wanting to experience Marrakech.,Date of stay: July 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Happiness52
La Sultana Marrakech,ASilverman wrote a review Jul 2011,50,One word ... amazing,For any one travelling to Marrakech ... stay at La Sultana!    I dont usually write reviews but I thought for this I just had to recommend!    As soon as we arrived at the hotel we were greatly welcomed by the staff who gave us a highly personalised service by showing us around the riad (my boyfriend and I were speechless as to how beautiful it was-the pictures are lovely but it is even better in real life) we were also given traditional mint tea and pastries on arrival and shown to our room which was very large with a beautiful bathroom coated with pink rose petals.    We arrived in the evening so thought we should sample the restaurant as it was a stunning setting around the pool and a man played the mandolin whilst we ate. This was a fantastic experience and the waiters were so keen to please.    The riad is also in the perfect location only a ten minute walk from the main market and right in the middle of the Medina and the action.    The swimming pool is beautiful and you can even go on the terrace to sunbath.  There is also a complimentary mini bar (bar alcohol) which was a nice touch.    We also did an excursion to the Atlas Mountains which we organised with the riad on our arrival. It was a lovely change to the hustle of Marrakech and is really worth doing to see the berber culture. We went to Ourika Valley and visited an Argan oil workshop and then were taken to Richard Branson's Morrocan Retreat for lunch which was also beautiful.    If I ever go back to Marrakech I will definitely stay at La Sultana! I have stayed in many 5 star hotels but the service you receive at La Sultana and the riad setting is unlike anywhere else I have ever stayed.,Date of stay: June 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ASilverman

There were not many people staying there so we got an upgrade to a huge room overlooking the pool. Soft drinks from the mini bar were free as was our welcome gift of wine fruit nuts & Moroccan sweets.    The staf were all very friendy and helpful. Service was attentive but not too intrusive.    Breakfast on the open roof terrace was smashing and the range and quality of the food suited us perfectly. Ate dinner twice there which was probably enough. Menue is a bit limited but not too expensive compared to the places outside which serve booze. (KozyBar & La Tanji are both good and only 10 mins walk away).    Pool area was amazing. Such a tranquil spot in the Medina. Roof terrace for the last couple of hours suns and a Casablanca beer rounded off any day.    The small bar downstairs with a wondow to the pool was closed. No big deal. The surrounding streets are rpetty grotty but then that is the Medina for you. Enjoy the luxury of La Sultana even more knowing it is in the middle of bedlham.

It was quite difficult to get to by car and by foot because the entire area in front of the hotel had been reduced to impassible rubble by some kind of road construction. We had rented a car and literally spent hours just trying to find the place then weren't able to get the car (and our luggage) anywhere near the hotel itself - THEN were told that we had better move our car or we would be getting a very expensive ticket. Ugh. Hardly the reception one expects at ""The Small Luxury Hotels of World"".    Each of the room is set up around a central square ""medina"" style. I had booked a large room (not the cheapest room not the most expensive as I recall). Well when they put us in our room it had shuttered windows that opened up onto the pool/restaurant area and was about 10 feet by 7 feet. People in the pool/restaurant smoke quite a bit so there was constant smoke coming in the room through the shutters - not to mention that the room was dark (because it was either smoky and light and no privacy or dark and a bit smoky).  So it was not a great situation.    By the second night they moved our room but by then I really felt like the whole trip was tainted by my complaining about this and that. And you know the hotel is quite expensive it should have just been great from the beginning.

We stayed at La Sultanta beginning of July 2011 for one week and La Sultana was the ideal Riad its location within the Medina walls was easy walking distance to the Souks at the Place Jenna el Fna and attractions. The rooms the decor and the service were excellent we experienced no problems whatsoever. We enjoyed a day at the La Sultana Spa experiencing for the first time a Hamman which was relaxing nothing was too much trouble.  The meals were first class and whatever was requested was provided it was the little touches that made La Sultana special.  We had a wonderful stay and the staff could not be more helpful and welcoming. La Sultana was as magical as the country.  I would recommend La Sultanta to anyone wanting to experience Marrakech.,Date of stay: July 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Happiness52
La Sultana Marrakech,ASilverman wrote a review Jul 2011,50,One word ... amazing,For any one travelling to Marrakech ... stay at La Sultana!    I dont usually write reviews but I thought for this I just had to recommend!    As soon as we arrived at the hotel we were greatly welcomed by the staff who gave us a highly personalised service by showing us around the riad (my boyfriend and I were speechless as to how beautiful it was-the pictures are lovely but it is even better in real life) we were also given traditional mint tea and pastries on arrival and shown to our room which was very large with a beautiful bathroom coated with pink rose petals.    We arrived in the evening so thought we should sample the restaurant as it was a stunning setting around the pool and a man played the mandolin whilst we ate. This was a fantastic experience and the waiters were so keen to please.    The riad is also in the perfect location only a ten minute walk from the main market and right in the middle of the Medina and the action.    The swimming pool is beautiful and you can even go on the terrace to sunbath.  There is also a complimentary mini bar (bar alcohol) which was a nice touch.    We also did an excursion to the Atlas Mountains which we organised with the riad on our arrival. It was a lovely change to the hustle of Marrakech and is really worth doing to see the berber culture. We went to Ourika Valley and visited an Argan oil workshop and then were taken to Richard Branson's Morrocan Retreat for lunch which was also beautiful.    If I ever go back to Marrakech I will definitely stay at La Sultana! I have stayed in many 5 star hotels but the service you receive at La Sultana and the riad setting is unlike anywhere else I have ever stayed.,Date of stay: June 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ASilverman

La Sultana Marrakech,Monksie03 wrote a review Jul 2011,50,A true Oasis in the Madina of Marrakech,Stayed 10 nights in La Sultana. The hotel was superb and exceeded our expectations. There were not many people staying there so we got an upgrade to a huge room overlooking the pool. Soft drinks from the mini bar were free as was our welcome gift of wine fruit nuts & Moroccan sweets.    The staf were all very friendy and helpful. Service was attentive but not too intrusive.    Breakfast on the open roof terrace was smashing and the range and quality of the food suited us perfectly. Ate dinner twice there which was probably enough. Menue is a bit limited but not too expensive compared to the places outside which serve booze. (KozyBar & La Tanji are both good and only 10 mins walk away).    Pool area was amazing. Such a tranquil spot in the Medina. Roof terrace for the last couple of hours suns and a Casablanca beer rounded off any day.    The small bar downstairs with a wondow to the pool was closed. No big deal. The surrounding streets are rpetty grotty but then that is the Medina for you. Enjoy the luxury of La Sultana even more knowing it is in the middle of bedlham.

La Sultana Marrakech,Katie N wrote a review Aug 2011,30,"Very Nice Hotel, But I Don't Think I'd Go Back","My sixteen year old son and I stayed at La Sultana last December for a week and found it to be a beautiful and fascinating hotel although a bit different than what we expected. It was quite difficult to get to by car and by foot because the entire area in front of the hotel had been reduced to impassible rubble by some kind of road construction. We had rented a car and literally spent hours just trying to find the place then weren't able to get the car (and our luggage) anywhere near the hotel itself - THEN were told that we had better move our car or we would be getting a very expensive ticket. Ugh. Hardly the reception one expects at ""The Small Luxury Hotels of World"".    Each of the room is set up around a central square ""medina"" style. I had booked a large room (not the cheapest room not the most expensive as I recall). Well when they put us in our room it had shuttered windows that opened up onto the pool/restaurant area and was about 10 feet by 7 feet. People in the pool/restaurant smoke quite a bit so there was constant smoke coming in the room through the shutters - not to mention that the room was dark (because it was either smoky and light and no privacy or dark and a bit smoky).  So it was not a great situation.    By the second night they moved our room but by then I really felt like the whole trip was tainted by my complaining about this and that. And you know the hotel is quite expensive it should have just been great from the beginning.    There are so many awesome places in Marrakech I think I stay somewhere else next time.",Date of stay: December 2010,Trip type: Traveled with family,Grosse Pointe Far,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatieN67

La Sultana Marrakech,Serial_Traveller wrote a review Aug 2011,30,Hit and Miss.,The beauty of the intimate riads in Morocco is that you so often feel like you are staying in someone's home rather than a faceless hotel. I have had the good fortune to stay in several riads in Morocco and I do have an absolute favourite but I still like to try other riads for a few nights before returning to my No1. On this trip I decided to start my trip with a stay at La Sultana as many people rate it the best riad in Marrakech - so I had very high expectations. Upon making my reservation I noted a small detail - La Sultana  charge to collect you at the airport - no other riad has ever done so. Plus La  Sultana is possibly the most expensive riad there is and take a 50% deposit up front.    Anyway I went ahead with my booking - was collected at the airport - and without doubt upon arrival at the riad and being shown around it is a beautiful riad full of artisnal  handiwork (though I have stayed at riads more immaginativley and creatively decorated which I have been featured in books or magazines such as World of Interiors). But for me there the experience ended. My suite certainly lacked any wow-factor and verged on the very ordinary and uninspiring.    The riad has a very nice enclosed pool area but even in low season and with low occupancy there can easily be a race to get a sun lounger and it can feel claustrophobic - I absolutely hate to think what it would be like in high season (though in fairness that must be the same with most of the riads). Of course there are plenty of other places to sit especially on the roof but everyone wants to be by the pool. I have read some reviews which mention the wonderful roof top pool - let's tell the truth it is the size of a large bathtub but longer. It's unlikely you would want to share it with a stranger.  Sadly our relaxation by the pool - every day - was marred by one man who seemed to think it perfectly acceptable to have his music playing on his ipad and ruined the peace and tranquility. Further due to the influx of rich Russians who are now travelling to all the hot spots but have yet to learn any social etiquette grace or respectful manners when in the company of others they seem to think it acceptable to shout the whole day across the pool or courtyards to each other. Riads are supposed to be a place of tranquility NOT a theme park!    Over all I felt like La sultana was more like a hotel than an intimate riad. There were certainly none of the typical little luxuries of many other riads such as laying on a free afternoon tea (not even free Morrocan mint tea which you get just about everywhre) or a free laundry service. Plus housekeeping were very good at taking things away but not replacing them. Certainly breakfast was an absolute shambles every morning - can we have napkins? butter? cutlery? preserves? And not one decent coffee or tea during our whole stay depite repeatedly asking for very hot water - plus at this riad's prices I expect some good loose leaf tea in a pot not an inferior brand tea bag on a saucer with a luke warm pot of water. So the bottom line is that I still have my No1 riad and I wouldn't stay at La Sultana again and I definitely wouldn't recommend it to any friends. The riad itself is beautiful (as is the spa) but the rest is just perfunctory and offers a very hit-or-miss service. But credit where it's due Mayumi and Khalib on reception are excellent and a couple of the younger staff who serve dinner in the evenings on the terrace have that magic smile and twinkle which is found more in abundance in other riads but that's about it.    Sadly I suspect I shall remember La Sultana for the wrong reasons rather than the good ones and I have to ask why is this one of the most expensive riads in Marrakech which offers so little to justify the price? I am only left with one question when reading many of the posted reviews of La Sultana that speak of it in glowing terms and that is have you stayed at any other riads in Morrocco for comparison? If this had been my first riad stay and I had nothing to compare with then I probably would have been impressed. But I am only too aware there are other riads that give you a far better service and treat you to a far better Morrocan experience and good hospitality and are cheaper to stay at.,Date of stay: July 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Serial_Traveller
