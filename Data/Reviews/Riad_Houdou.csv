Riad Houdou,Gnawin wrote a review Yesterday,50,Peaceful Riad,Peaceful riad within walking distance of all the main sites of Marrakech. All of the staff were very friendly and knowledgeable giving us useful tips to help us get the most out of our stay.  We had one evening meal at the riad which was very nice. The breakfasts on the roof terrace each morning were a great start to the day. They even accommodated a slightly earlier breakfast on our check out day.  The riad is very quiet and peaceful with a relaxing atmosphere. There is a pool on the rooftop which is great. Look out for the two tortoises!  Would recommend this hotel for any stay in Marrakech where you want to explore the historic medina.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gnawin

Riad Houdou,Shona wrote a review Mar 18,50,An Oasis of Calm,This is a lovely Riad in an excellent location if you want to embrace the old medina.  We were warmly greeted by Didier one of the owners  given mint tea & Moroccan treats while we filled in the necessary paperwork.  We stayed in the junior suite  which was a little smaller than expected but perfectly comfortable with a lovely private terrace.  The Riad really was an oasis of calm after the busyness and noise of the medina. We loved the intimate dining room and enjoyed four delicious evening meals of traditional Moroccan cuisine . Breakfast was also a delight in the morning on the roof terrace.  You couldn’t hope to meet two friendlier more helpful and good humoured hosts . This on it’s own would be enough to recommend this Riad. Thank you so much Eric and Didier and the rest of the lovely supporting staff.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Greater London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shonam555
Riad Houdou,thatchangthang wrote a review Mar 11,40,Good for a Couples Trip,I stayed at the Riad Houdou in the Marrakesh medina for three nights on a friend trip.    I think the riad is a great place if you’re having a romantic trip. The hotel is set up as a perfect setting for this kind of trip. If you’re not on that kind of a trip it’s a little too much. Ultimately I booked the Riad Houdou because at the time it was the second best hotel on TripAdvisor when I sorted results by traveler rating.    They staff are very communicative and I received some good information on how to get to the riad from the owners and managers of the property. But really if you have data and can access google maps it’s not that difficult to find.    I was greeted by the owner who served us some nice treats and mint tea. We filled out a lot of paperwork and then we were handed over to the front desk manager who then walked us through another set of information. This desk manager helped us download an app on our smartphones that he said would be easier for us to navigate the warren of throughways in the Marrakesh medina.    I think the welcome and info session was a little bit too heavy of a touch. My friend kept looking at me while we were having the conversations with the owner and desk manager because he was eager to drop our stuff off and head out.    We booked one of two of the largest suites on the property. They were more like family rooms with two small child size beds and one large queen size bed in an open plan. It was a little awkward going into the room and seeing rose petals everywhere like they just assumed that my friend and I were there for a romantic vacation (ergo the title) but maybe they do this for everyone.    The property seemed like it was restored in a very loving way that honored Moroccan culture. Everything worked just fine and despite the apparent age of the riad it was up to date with modern amenities like wi-fi and air conditioning. There was even attention paid to the environment with things like filtered water available to all guests instead of providing bottled water. The area it was in was a little rough lots of stray cats and weird smells in the alley leading up to the door. The entry is by door bell as well and you have to make special provisions if it's late at night because the attendant may not be aware that someone is trying to gain access to the riad.    The breakfast that is included is very good. It is a served breakfast with scratch made yogurt (some of the most delicious yogurt I’ve ever had) and eggs made a la minute.    My friend said that he liked the hotel but if he were to visit Marrakesh again the novelty of staying at a riad is just not enough to warrant a repeat visit. The convenience of staying in the new city convinced him that he would rather stay there.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Chicago, Illinois",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thatchangthang
Riad Houdou,John M wrote a review Mar 7,50,Wonderful stay with excellent hosts and staff,The location is in the midst of the Medina but provided a quite oasis during our stay. The extremely pleasant owners are always around to provide information recommendations and interesting conversation. The place and our room were as advertised in the photos stylishly decorated and clean. The rooftop was wonderful although a bit cold for us to enjoy fully. We were able to have breakfast on the rooftop 3 mornings which was very nice. The staff was amazing always checking on us and the service at breakfast and 3 dinners we enjoyed was perfect! The breakfast was perfect and the variety and quality of meals at dinner provided a good sense of local cuisine without having to leave the riad.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Houston, Texas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnmP2677UA
Riad Houdou,Allyb590 wrote a review Mar 4,50,Fabulous!,We have stayed in many places all over the world but this has got to be one of the friendliest places we have ever stayed. All of the staff from the owner Didier to Abdel Hassan and all of the wonderful ladies who cooked and served the food were polite friendly and courteous nothing being too much trouble for them. The Riad is a beautiful old building tucked down a little alleyway a few minutes walk from the madness that is Marrakech medina. The food was lovely and the place was spotless.

Riad Houdou,nickman2015 wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Wonderful stay in this oasis of calm,Amazing location right in the heart of the Medina. Once you go down the alley to the Riad you enter a calm oasis. Staff were fantastic and couldn’t do enough for us. Yes the bed was too hard for me but that’s expected in most places we go to abroad and it didn’t detract from the trip at all. Breakfasts were fantastic and varied and the one evening meal we had was great. Really what makes this Riad so good is the staff. The briefing on arrival to explain how the city works and the “do’s and dont’s” was hugely helpful. Yes the Medina is full on but when you know how to deal with it and how to navigate the maze of alleys then it’s not hard. Thanks all we had a blast!,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nickman2015
Riad Houdou,HappyHammer69 wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Amazing Stay,We loved the sanctuary of Riad Houdou where you are instantly transported into calmness from the hustle and bustle of the Medina. The hotel manager made us very welcome and gave us some great tips for navigating the Medina. We would definitely stay here again. The room was fantastic up on the roof a short walk from the relief of the pool where you can cool down breakfast also served on the rooftop was amazing you must try it. We also made full use of the spa having a massage and a hammam.,Date of stay: October 2022,,"Port Macquarie, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyHammer69
Riad Houdou,FamilySuds wrote a review Feb 2023,50,This is a little gem,Had the most amazing stay here with 8 friends. This is a beautiful comfortable stylish Riad in the old city. Cannot thank Abdel Hussain and the ladies who cooked our first evening meal and served our breakfasts enough. The service and care was outstanding. On arrival Abdel gave us a 20min talk re: what to do where to go plus guidelines. This made our visit all the more pleasurable it was very helpful. We had our first evening meal here a delicious chicken tagine. There are veggie/vegan alternatives just let them know when booking. Would also recommend La Foundouk for dinner and drinks very close to the Riad (5min walk). Pepenero is a 20min walk great food. The hamman and massage on site needs to be pre-book so email before arriving. Highly recommend. Like previous reviews this is a gorgeous place with lovely staff.,Date of stay: January 2023,,"Market Harborough, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FamilySuds
Riad Houdou,Shane O wrote a review Jan 2023,50,Thoroughly deserving of the great reviews,We spent a week in Marrakech staying in the Riad Houdou and would wholeheartedly recommend it. The accommodation is tasteful clean comfortable and full of character the staff are friendly helpful and professional and the food for breakfast and dinner is a treat. Abdel is a wonderful host who gave us plenty of very useful tips and advice - particularly important in a city like Marrakech which can be somewhat overwhelming to a first-time visitor. Usually we would make our own way to our accommodation but I’m glad we opted for their transfers to and from the airport. Next time we’re in Marrakech we’ll definitely stay here.,Date of stay: December 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/612shaneo

Riad Houdou,Eleanor C wrote a review Jan 2023,50,All guesthouses should be like this,We had a fantastic four-night stay at Riad Houdou. We took advantage of the airport pick up which was great and meant we didn't have any issues on arrival. The Riad is based down a quiet alley near the busy Medina - but don't let that put you off. The location was absolutely perfect close to everything we wanted to see and we felt safe throughout our stay.     We were greeted on arrival with delicious homemade pastries and mint tea before being shown a map of the area and hearing some top tips for our stay. This had to be one of the warmest and most informative welcomes we've ever received. This small team is exceptional and they really made our stay!    Our beautiful room was on the ground floor next to one of courtyards. It was clean and had everything we needed including a really comfortable bed - we slept so well during our stay!     I would highly recommend eating dinner at the Riad - their chef is outstanding! We had dinner there for three nights because it was so good. Each night we were excited to see what kind of three-course meal would await us after a busy day of sightseeing. On two of the nights we were the only ones eating there so it felt even more special to have the cosy dining room to ourselves. We loved the thoughtful touches like explaining the dishes and any stories behind them as they were served.    We also arranged a couple of private tours through the Riad (a trip to Essaouira and a mule trekking in the mountains (Imlil)). Both trips were amazing and with a fantastic driver - highly recommended!! We were so pleased that we did these through the Riad.    Although we were only there for four nights Riad Houdou felt like our home away from home and we really loved the team working there who clearly care about what they do. We were sad to leave but so pleased to have found this place. Don't hesitate to book - you'll not be disappointed!

Riad Houdou,JakeT1992 wrote a review Jan 2023,50,The best place to stay in Marrakesh,Riad Houdou is a beautiful place to stay in Marrakesh. We were collected by the riads prearranged transfer from the airport. Easy and well priced. As it was a shared ride with 2 other guests they also halved the bill.  The welcome was very friendly and the staff at all times were very friendly and helpful. Lots of information to get you going which was appreciated. Our room was lovely and quaint and plenty of space for the 2 of us for 3 nights.  On the first morning there were also some homemade pastries and candles for my wife’s birthday. A nice surprise.  The Riad is located down a small side street just off of a main thoroughfare and is very convenient to explore the medina.  Highly recommend staying and thank you to all of the staff.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Swindon, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JakeT1992

Riad Houdou,Emily B wrote a review Jan 2023,50,New Year’s stay,Me and my husband have just returned home from an incredible weeks stay in the riad from the second we arrived we felt at peace and relaxed. The staff are so attentive nothing is too much trouble for them and they are always around with a friendly smile. We loved learning a bit more about the area on arrival and we actually ended up attending almost every recommended place/restaurant with every meal we ate being sensational highly recommend following the advice. We spent New Year’s Eve celebrating in the riad with an incredible meal and some fun entertainment it was an evening we will remember forever. For our last full day in Morocco we decided to book a trip and this was all handled amazingly through the riad we loved seeing the Atlas Mountains and the journey to Ait Ben hoddou was incredible as well as experiencing the spot. We had an issue with an outside taxi company who was meant to pick us up and take us to the airport home and didn’t arrive but we were rescued and helped by our driver from the previous day which we massively appreciated he couldn’t have been friendlier and really made our trip special. We would 100% recommend a stay here you won’t be disappointed and we loved it so much that we will definitely book to stay again when we return to Morocco in the future. Quick mention also to the delicious food I am already missing my breakfast on the roof terrace. Huge thank you to all the lovely staff.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K7567ZUemilyb
Riad Houdou,Goldies78 wrote a review Dec 2022,50,Wouldn’t stay anywhere else in Marrakech,Riad Houdou is an oasis of calm in the mist of the wonderful Marrakech chaos. Every single staff member was exceptional the food was delicious (we had 2 dinners in addition to daily breakfasts which was a delightful surprise every day) and the roof terrace / pool area was a wonderful place to relax and cool down after days spent investigating the wonders that Marrakech has to offer.    We stayed in the Tagine room (a deluxe double) which was perfect for us as a couple. We took advantage of the Hammam in the riad (thank you Mona) and also booked a hiking day trip (with Said) in the Atlas which was magical. Hamza took care of all our transfers (SO much easier to use these as arranged by the riad) and the advice and map we were given were invaluable.    Thank you to everyone - Abdul Hussein Shaima and everyone else whose names we have forgotten - as well as Didier and Eric. We had a wonderful stay and would not consider staying anywhere else if/when we return.    Book your stay here.

Eric & Didier with their staff put in their outmost to make our stay an once in a lifetime experience.    The city cannot be described with words and the location of this Riad is brilliant. You go through an extremely busy part of the city then you turn 90 degrees right follow a narrow street 200 meters- and suddenly you find yourself knocking on a door to an oasis of - tranquility.

Riad Houdou,Ben W wrote a review Dec 2022,50,"One of the best ""hotel"" experiences i've had","Excellent location set down a street less than a minute back from one of the roads you follow to the main Medina square. It is less than 5 minutes walk away from the common place to get taxis to places outside of the Medina and also where tour guides/buses collect tourists staying in the Medina. The walk to the main square is around 10-15 minutes depending on the amount of foot traffic but there is a very simply route to follow to get there and back which the hotel staff very helpfully mark out on a map for you. There are plenty of food options nearby and small shops that charge normal (non-tourist) prices nearby.    The Riad itself is amazingly presented and really lives up to its name the place is relaxing and quiet and can be a welcome escape from the noise of the Medina.    The staff make you feel like you are being welcomed in their home and always check in with you when you return to the Riad are very happy to give advice and recommendations and give a comprehensive Marrakech ""survival"" top tips when you arrive on how to avoid scams and where to visit. The staff go out of their way to accommodate you such as providing breakfast earlier if you are leaving early for a tour.    A true 5* service.

Riad Houdou,Barbara G wrote a review Dec 2022,50,Fantastic oasis of peace in a middle of bustling Medina,Fantastic place to stay in Morroco 10-15 min walk to Jemaa El Fna square and pretty close to everything. In a heart of Medina so as soon as you step out and walk down narrow lane you find yourself in locals marekt and street bustle.  Owners Eric and Didier are super friendly and mostly around for a chat.  As soon as we arrived our host Houssein sat us down wiht mint tea and spent good hour giving us tips on how to navigate Medina from how to walk the streets to skills in haggling and how much to expect to pay for taxi! Fantatsic concierege service and we came away with insider knowledge whihc proved to b everty useful on many occasions. There is Spa in Riad and I had wonderful massage by Raja who managed to ease my migraine wiht her wonderful hands. Thoroughly recommend it!  The Riad is designed beautifully with traditional authentic furniture bric a brac and witty touches of 60's and 70's Morrocan pop culture.  Our breakfasts were served on terrace accompanied by birdsong.  Our room was beautiful we stayed in Zellige suite which has large doube bed in one room and two single beds in the other.  The only one small issue is that the toilet is accesed from the room wher you sleep. All of the locks are traditional large metal locks that make a LOT of noise so if anyone is going at night it will be very loud for people sleeping in that room- something to consider if you travel with kids or light sleepers?  The toiletries were top end Morrocan products with gorgeous scent of verbena and orange blossom.

Riad Houdou,Paul wrote a review Dec 2022,50,A peaceful and calm Riad in the busy and mad medina - highly recommended!,We had a great stay at Riad Houdou and would highly recommend it to others. We were warmly welcomed by Eric with some Morrocan treats and delicious mint tea and were gven a bit of background about the Riad. We were given excellent advice from staff members to ensure we were well prepared for our Marrakech experience with plenty of recommendations for places to eat and visit.    Our room was the Tangine room which was based on the first floor and overlooks the private plunge pool of the room below. The room was fantastic and well-equipped with a decent shower. My only warning would be that the Riad's walls are thin since it's an old building so you are likely going to hear any inconsiderate noisy guests in other rooms. However this was a minor inconvenience and I wouldn't let this detract from the multiple positives of staying at Riad Houdou.    Breakfast is served on the rooftop terrace which offers a different Morrocan dish every morning along with yoghurt and fruit. It was simple but tasty and helped set us up for a day exploring Marrakech. I would also recommend eating in the Riad one evening as the food was delicious.    The biggest praise I can give is to the staff of the Riad. They were all incredible! They were friendly and attentive helping ensure your visit to the city was the best it could be.

The beautifully set rooms (we used two as we returned to Marrakech after finishing our trip to the desert). The really homemade breakfast ingredients changed every day.

The manager came to meet us where the taxi dropped us off as it’s located in the Medina. Inside the Riad it’s beautiful so tranquil and an escape from the hustle & bustle outside in the Medina. You can walk easily anywhere from here & the main square is 10-15min walk . We were given a thorough briefing when we arrived with some useful tips & suggestions. Our room was lovely & the pool was nice to cool off in the afternoon. Breakfast was fresh and delicious and served on the outside terrace. Would definitely stay here again when in Marrakesh!

It was my first stay in Marrakech and didn’t know what to expect. When the taxi dropped me there was a man waiting to take my bags by cart to the riad. Walking through the crazy Medina with speeding scooters was quite an experience but the minute the riad door opened it was calm and heavenly. Husain offered me mint tea cookies and gave me maps and some do’s and dont’s which proved to be invaluable. My room had the private plunge pool and it was incredible. The bed was so soft with a great shower. Dinner was incredible. One of the best meals I’ve ever had. The staff were so accommodating and attentive. And of course Eric and Didier were the perfect hosts. The breakfast was absolutely delicious every morning with a wonderful view and the pool was a welcome relief to the heat. Everywhere you look there was something beautiful to look at and a lovely place to sit.

The beautifully set rooms (we used two as we returned to Marrakech after finishing our trip to the desert).  The really homemade breakfast ingredients changed every day.

Riad Houdou,Jorge N wrote a review Aug 2022,50,Read carefully to see why you’re booking the best experience in Morocco,Ask yourself what you want from your vacation. Is it a corporation mega luxury McMansion hotel or is it an experience of authenticity and bliss?    Because this Riad is both!! It is not a corporate copy and paste hotel but it is so luxurious and so unique it is incredible.    Firstly you start by arriving to the Moukaff Square in the old Medina (pay max 100 diram for taxi) and you walk into the market for 2 minutes before turning into an alleyway that lead to the Riad. That gave it an awesome sense of authenticity and adventure. Once the door opened it was like walking through a portal into the most amazing stay ever. The Riad is unbelievable the rooms are just so so nice and romantic. Our room had rose petals all over the bed and it was air conditioned which was epic. The doors the corridors and all the rooms they have for a read games or a computer shows the level of detail that’s gone into this place and the care shows a lot.    It was my partners birthday and they gave her a small gift and prepared such a lovely supper. They also allowed us to use the pool a bit after normal hours (if we were quiet ofc!) and it is the perfect way to shake off the blistering heat!    You are about 10 minutes from El Fna square and it’s perfect because the square gets very very loud! You are close to a lot of the museums from the Riad and there are a lot of restaurants in the area.    We spoke to the concierge who gave us a map an app and a detailed how to guide on navigating through marrakech from expected local manners to bartering to make your stay as pleasant and wallet friendly as possible. They are super nice.    The owners are another story. Hands down the nicest people in Morocco. Maybe but in Marrakech at least. They are so proud of their Riad and you can tell they love what they do. We wanted to do a lot and unfortunately didn’t get to speak to them as much as I would’ve wanted to but they are so lovely so friendly and have transformed this Riad in the 4 years that they have owned it.    The only thing I can mark down is that I can’t live there full time. Stay here and experience as much as you enjoy.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Juan23getit

Like something out of the Arabian nights. The proprietors of this establishment Eric and Didier have done an immaculate restoration and decoration job on it. Additionally they are charming helpful and informative about everything you may need in Marrakech. They employ a large staff who are equally charming and efficient. Special mention to Abdel the major domo and Rania who was in charge of the breakfasts and meals. There are many others who should be thanked but I can't remember all their names.

If you want gracious and expert personal attention in a convenient location this is the place for you. Upon arrival a staff member sits down with you to point out sites to see and gives you directions from the Riad. You are also given tips about etiquette and how to maneuver the medina. There is an onsite spa breakfast on the lovely rooftop terrace is included dinner is available on request and the food is purchased fresh for dinner daily attention is given to any dietary needs. Snacks are also readily available. I had an amazing cheese tray of top quality. They provide a number of private tours with a variety to suit anyone's needs.  The staff speak a number of languages so communication is easy. They were very encouraging of my efforts to revive my rusty French and did it with patience and humor.  What I appreciated most was their attention to detail and their skill at making us feel relaxed and well cared for.  I can't say enough about this beautiful Riad and the entire staff.

The owners Eric and Didier will give you the warmest welcome on your arrival and will explain everything you need to know about the city. It's the little touches like the welcome tortoise roaming the patio and friendly staff that make this a great place to stay. Rooms and lovley and each one has a different local theme. Everywhere is spotlessly cleaned. The roof terrace with sun loungers and pool is the perfect place to relax after a day exploring the busy city. The breakfast we had prepared for us each morning was simply amazing and everything you could want. They even went out of their way to cater for allergens such as gluten. To sum it all up this is a beautiful Riad with amazing staff that can't do enough for you. If you're thinking of staying his just book it!

We would visit again and highly recommend.,Date of stay: April 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adventurer601793
Riad Houdou,steve L wrote a review Apr 2022,50,Friendly peaceful haven in the lively old town area,We had a truly special time at this Riad. It is a peaceful haven in the middle the mad lively old town. Didier and Eric made us feel welcome from the start and provided all the help and advice we needed to enjoy our holiday there. Each day started with a simple but delicious breakfast on the roof terrace with distant views of the Atlas mountains. I highly recommend their home cooked dinner in their small interestingly and tastefully decorated private dinning room on at least one night.  I highly recommend staying here.,Date of stay: April 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W8775WBstevel
Riad Houdou,Quest770547 wrote a review Mar 2022,50,genuine riad experience with accommodating owners and staff,Riad Houdou is an amazing riad in Marrakech. The room we booked had its own private pool. Breakfast was excellent and the staff were very warm and friendly. Credits especially to Hassan. The Riad was also very accommodating even with the incident we experienced from a poorly-organized tour (from another agency). We were told that the Tour would bring us back to the Riad by 8:30pm and we ended up returning at 11:30pm (Very poor tour organizers). We called up Riad Houdou to inform them of this and they waited for us. Even with our updated ETA (which the tour guide said was 10:30pm) Riad Houdou still waited for us and when we finally arrived the owner welcomed us warmly and told us that this was not our fault. He explained the dinner and the preparation and Hassan served us until 1am. He did not rush us or anything which I really found very warm and accommodating. The room was beautiful and it smelled of roses. The bed was comfortable and we were able to ask for extra pillows. The breakfast was hearty and beautifully prepared. Orange juice was freshly squeezed. The Riad is also beautiful. I had a meeting after checkout and the owners accommodated me in one of the dining areas and closed the door so I can have some privacy. Will definitely stay here when I return.,Date of stay: March 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Quest770547

Riad Houdou,Jim G wrote a review Nov 2021,50,"Outstanding hosts, beautiful riad, convenient location",We stayed at Riad Houdou for three nights in late October 2021.The hosts-Eric Didier and Abdel were amazing. They offered helpful tips for navigating the Medina as well as recommendations for local sights and restaurants. The riad is beautiful and equisitely decorated to provide a very relaxing enironment. Wifi worked well throughout the riad. Breakfast is served on a rooftop terrace and included fresh fruit yogurt moroccon pancakes eggs to order fresh orange juice and coffee or tea. The pool is also on the terrace and is relatively small and shallow but provides a pleasant escape on a hot day. We had dinner at the riad on two evenings it was outstanding and featured Moroccon specialites. They offer alcohol (wine beer spirits) for reasonable prices. The riad arranged for a private car to meet us at the Casablanca airport and take us to the riad. This worked out beautifully as the riad can be challenging to locate initially. The riad is very conveniently located in the medina with a short ~10 min walk to the central square. The hosts are passionate about their riad and providing outstanding service.

Riad Houdou,Cal100 wrote a review Sep 2021,50,Excellent stay and world class service,Originally I was going to stay just two nights at the Houdou. As things turned out I ended up spending nearly a week. It was a pure delight. The location is perfect for access to all the Medina has to offer. The service was over the top good. The manager Abdul is an absolute rockstar any need that I had any idea he was able to work his magic to make it happen. An example I was trying to get a tee time and the course was being non responsive he stepped in and was able to get me set. The Riad itself is a masterpiece with a plunge pool and garden in the center. Rooms are spacious and decor is beautiful.    They have a local massage therapist that comes over and was incredible.

Riad Houdou,Mary P wrote a review Mar 2020,50,Five star stay,Our four nights at the Riad Houdou were wonderful. Our room was perfect and wonderfully comfortable for us. We decided to use the various services offered to make our trip easier. The pickup from the airport was seamless and we were extremely happy that the driver and then porter knew where they were going. We would have never found the Riad on our own. Our greeting by Eric was warm and welcoming. He introduced us to hot sugared mint tea and I was hooked. We booked a hammam with relaxing massage at the Riad spa for the day of arrival. DO NOT MISS THIS EXPERIENCE...it was amazing. Following the spa we enjoyed a delicious candlelit dinner In the dining room. We booked through the Riad a full day tour of the old city on the first day and the second we booked the Riad’s tour to the Atlas Mountains and the Berber village of Imlil. Both tours were outstanding. Breakfast each morning on the rooftop was great. Be sure to have a map application on your phone so you can navigate the streets and souks. The location of the Riad was convenient and safe but you do need a very good digital map.,Date of stay: March 2020,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D8663MMmaryp

The Riad is spotlessly clean and a water fountain is available for guests to access filtered water throughout the stay which was great.  We booked a meal for our first evening and ate 3 delicious courses served by attentive staff and obviously cooked by a talented chef. I’m a big fan of soup and the courgette soup starter was one of the tastiest I’ve ever eaten. The breakfasts were delicious varying each morning with eggs cooked to order and came with unusual extras such as beetroot jam which was fantastic - who knew?!  We also took advantage of the in-house Hammam which was professional and very relaxing.  A big thank you to all the staff who gave us top tips for a safe and enjoyable visit when we first arrived and was on hand throughout our stay.

It is welcoming safe and spotless.  They will help you to organise taxis where to find great visiting spots and nothing was a problem to them.  The owners have great taste and there is a wonderful selection of books to relax on the sun terrace with over the best coffee we have had anywhere.

Food is available in house which might be helpful if you wish the avoid navigating the narrow maze of Marrakesh streets at night looking for restaurants. The Riad itself is beautifully furnished and decorated in style (features in the guidebook!) whilst staying true to the authenticity of the structure. It comprises of 3 adjoined houses.

The breakfast is delicious traditional and homemade (each morning we were also asked if we wanted eggs). Communication was fantastic in organising the stay extras like taxis and treatments and also assisting us in confirming a tour we had arranged ourselves.

Riad Houdou,Simon W wrote a review Feb 2020,50,A delightful oasis of calm close to all the action,Riad Houdou is ideally placed - only ten minutes walk from the main square but nontheless just far enough away to provide a beautiful oasis of calm in the midst of Marrakech. The building is a beautifully converted traditional family Riad with small garden courtyards and balconies around them. Our en-suite room was stylishly furnished and perfect for our stay. Breakfast every morning on the terrace was a great start to each day and we had dinner one night which was a traditional tagine of chicken prepared by the in-house cook. The staff are fantastic - nothing was too much trouble for them. The building is easy to find once you know but hard if you don't - so we took advantage of their airport-service which got us to the front door via a taxi and a man-with-a-barrow; and after that we were all set.

Riad Houdou,Camper789355 wrote a review Jan 2020,50,"Beautiful Riad, perfect base for exploring the Medina",We spent 4 nights at Riad Houdou. It would have been hard to improve on as a base for a stay in Marrakech.  The Riad is elegantly furnished and the peace and tranquility inside is an extraordinary contrast from the noise and chaos of the Medina just outside. Its location is ideal only 15 minutes walk from Jemaa-el-Fna and very close to a lot of interesting attractions; it’s also (relatively) easily accessible to taxis just a few minutes from a point they can be picked up.  The hospitality shown by Eric Didier and all the staff was outstanding. On our arrival still a bit dazed from our first experience of the Medina we were greeted with mint tea while Abdel took his time to point out to us some of the recommended places to visit gave us some very valuable “survival” tips and then very helpfully escorted us part way to Jemaa-el-Fna to help orient us - getting lost in the Medina is an occupational hazard especially for first time visitor.  We opted to spend a little extra for the Junior Suite; located on the top floor it was probably even quieter than other rooms. It had a nice private terrace however during our stay it was a little too cold to make much use of it. The bed was very comfortable though might be a little firm for some tastes.  We had dinner in the Riad on our 1st night the food was delicious and breakfast was always excellent with little variations on each day.  I’d strongly recommend accepting the Riad’s offer of an airport transfer it especially made our arrival much less stressful that it would have been otherwise.  Finally only 100m away is Cafe Restaurant Dar L’hssira highly rated on TripAdvisor and an absolute bargain for a simple tasty Tagine or Couscous.,Date of stay: January 2020,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Camper789355

We are here a night and it was such good food. The kitchen is sparkly clean. This Riad is a well oiled machine. We stayed in one the suites upstairs and having the extra room to rest and read was special as well.  We loved being so close to all of the comings and goings that make Marrakech magical.

This was my second trip to Marrakech and this one is the real deal! Location is perfect in the middle of the Medina. The personal walking tour they offered to get your bearings was invaluable too. Don’t be in a rush to explore when you arrive. Take the time to speak to owner Didier tell you his story of how he moved here from France and what this place means to him and it’s history while sipping their incredible mint tea. Be sure to eat dinner at the riad your first nice for the full experience. “Splurge” for the en suite rooms. Enjoy sunset beers on the rooftop and sunrise breakfast at the same.

The Riad itself is beautiful very quiet with beautiful original features and lots of quirky little extras much make it unique. We had a beautiful breakfast of yogurt fruit and pancakes in the morning. All freshly prepared. We ate dinner one night in the Rad and it was the best meal we had during our stay in Marrakech (although the food everywhere was very good). All of the staff were extremely warm welcoming and friendly and Diddler was a great help at check out printing my boarding passes for me. The riad is in a great location if you want the authentic Marrakech experience - it is a 15/20 minute walk to the main square through streets and alleys full of hustle and bustle.

Riad Houdou,Gypsy1352 wrote a review Jan 2020,50,Best place to stay in the Medina!,I was thrilled to discover this lovely quiet guest house tucked away in the bustle of the Medina of Marrakech. Every detail is attended to in your room delicious breakfast each morning on the rooftop terrace and if you're not necessarily up for adventuring out to dine you'll enjoy all the exquisite tastes of Morocco with made-to-order traditional meals prepared each night for guests with traditional 5 star service to boot. Just tell them by 11AM that you'll be dining in so that their wonderful chef can pick up all the necessities in the market that day. Keep in mind that as it is located in the Medina you'll need to walk a bit to get to the entrance. Samira does a great job of helping guests find their way around the city. This traditional riad itself is wonderful to explore.

Riad Houdou,DJMc wrote a review Jan 2020,50,"A stunning Riad, and a wonderful break",Where do I start. What a wonderful  beautiful and completely authentic Riad in the heart of the Medina. I will start with the booking service. After diligently completing some checks through Trip Advisor and on the Riad website I chose Riad Houdou for a little break . Booking the room through the website was quick  easy and gave me a glimpse of the excellent service by the team at the hotel.  Abdel answered my queries quickly and ensured we were picked up at the airport and brought to the Riad without any fuss I thoroughly recommended using this service making the start of your holiday stress free. We were warmly welcomed by Eric at the hotel as long lost friends and brought mint tea which was very welcome after a long journey. Eric proceeded to recommend local areas of interest provided a map of the Medina and took us through the local do's and don'ts which proved to be invaluable advice giving us confidence to explore Marrakesh.  We chose the Chechias suite. In short it was magnificent. As per the rest of the Riad it is elegantly decorated stylish authentic and most important - spotlessly clean and very comfortable with ample room to relax after a busy day in the city. This room also has its own plunge pool separate from the bedroom which I can imagine is a welcome relief in summer however as it was Jan when we visited I did not take the plunge so to speak however it was a wonderful area to sit and read and forget about the pressures of the outside world.  We chose to eat at the Riad on the first night and what a treat it was you have to let them know in advance as the spices  meat and vegetables are sourced locally on the day and slow cooked over the course of the day to absolute perfection. I have eaten food in fine restaurants across the world and the food served here matches and in most cases beats them. Cooked with care  thought and impeccably delivered to your table if you choose to stay here the I definitely recommend eating here too.  Breakfast is served on the terrace and is freshly cooked and consists of pastries breads scrambled eggs fresh fruit  jams  yoghurt coffee  tea etc you will not be disappointed.  I feel lucky to have found a place I now consider a second home in Marrakesh  due to the sincerely kind  diligent caring service provided at this Riad. Thank you Eric  Didier and all the team at Houdou. You guys really are the real deal when it comes to delivering a top notch service in a beautifully authentic setting. We are sure to see you again as I know at some point I will need to experience Marrakesh and Houdou again.,Date of stay: January 2020,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaJMc72

As soon as we set foot through the door we were greeted by one of the owners Eric and the various staff who were all exceptionally warm and welcoming. All the staff took the time to introduce themselves and continued to check in with us regularly about our needs and experiences with genuine interest and care. The tranquility of the Riad is just what you need after a long flight or a break from the hectic nature of the Médina.    Being our first time in Morocco we were a little daunted about what to expect. The staff took the time to answer our questions give us helpful tips and tricks on how to manage certain situations and personally showed us landmarks to help us navigate our way around the Médina. Having now stayed at other more expensive “high end” riads in other parts of Morocco we can say that we have not experienced the same level of warmth kindness and authenticity that the staff at Riad Houdou provided throughout our stay there - it is really a personalised approach from the staff that makes this place unique.

Riad Houdou,aaron c wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Lovely place in the Marrakech Médina,Riad Houdou is a jewel of subtle elegance and tranquility within the ancient walls of the often wild and chaotic Marrakech Médina. It is your delightful resting place nestled in the heart of the beast. And its charm doesn’t stop there -the Riad’s restaurant offers better food than anything we found elsewhere in Marrakech. Their massage therapist is top-notch and the staff is authentically kind and accommodating and go all out to make your stay the best possible. I want to thank all of you by name since you were all so wonderful- Thank you Diddieric Eric Abdel Samira Hassan and Aziz! We had a great time in Marrakech largely due to your kindness and hospitality.,Date of stay: December 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W8559OCaaronc
Riad Houdou,Sabkymom wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Wonderful place away,We recently stayed at Riad Houdou and really loved the place and staff. The owners Didier and Eric were very prompt in sending/responding to emails when we first booked. I really appreciated the service as many Moroccan companies (hotels excursion groups etc.) were not very responsive. The riad is located in the medina but off a closed path which keeps it convenient but away from all the noise and hubbub. Samira Abdul and Hassan really go out of their way to make sure you know everything you need to know about Marrakech. One of them always sits down with you and chats over mint tea and homemade sweets in the courtyard upon arrival to walk you thru all the in’s and out’s of the area and riad. Each morning we started the day with a delicious complimentary breakfast on the rooftop terrace. We enjoyed a traditional exfolliation with black soap in their hamman a welcomed treat after traveling over 2 days from the US! There are lovely areas to hang out in the riad if you’re in need of some quiet time or additional space. Abdul Samira and Hassan looked after us as if we were family! They also recommended a nearby restaurant called Le Foundouk which is a higher end looking place with reasonable pricing and excellent food. Again if you’re interested in getting away from the hubbub of the medina this is a really great recommendation (make a reservation if you want to be on the terrace). Otherwise there are plenty of nearby places to get street food or sit on the street which we also did. Riad Houdou is a really delightful place to stay and our family of 4 adults thought it was a great way to start our 2 week vacation in Morocco!

The breakfast on the rooftop terrace was not only delicious but just a treat to be seating outside in the sun in the middle of December!

The enchanting atmosphere was exactly what you would expect in Marrakech; with cosy corners areas to sit lovely comfortable rooms and a splendid roof top terrace (where breakfast is service with nice weather and the pool is located).

Riad Houdou,LightPacker238615 wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Great Riad,We loved this Riad so much. All the staff there were so amazing. They made you feel right at home. They gave you very honest information up front about what to look out for and where to go. If you eat dinner (which you should) it is amazing the best food we’ve had so far. The homemade yogurt in the AM is delicious. The only thing to watch out for is the drain in the shower doesn’t drain (it will take all night) and it could flood into the bathroom. Just turn on the hot water at the lowest possible dribble to let it warm up and then shower. It’s best to do it quickly and turn off the water in between washing hair and body so you don’t flood the rest of the bathroom (it doesn’t dip down enough to stay in the shower alone). This by far shouldn’t deter you. That is literally the only thing I could think of that wasn’t perfect.,Date of stay: December 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Portland, Oregon",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LightPacker238615

Laundry service is available at a very reasonable price and tours can be arranged along with local suggestions.

The houdou is a beautiful place with oriental style and doesn't lack any amenities. Our hosts made us feel welcome and thought of everything we might not have thought of ourselves.

Arriving to such a warm welcome at this beautiful home away from home (warm smiles mint tea and delicious home made pastries) we realised we'd chosen the perfect spot to explore Marrakech and all just a short walk away from the main square in the Medina.  Didier and his team delivered perfect customer service throughout - always ready to help (Didier even walked with us to the square on our first evening).  The Riad is beautiful stylish and perfectly reflects the owners eclectic tastes with small treasures around every corner and on every wall. Bedrooms are chic cool and comfortable with air con fantastic showers and king size beds.  The courtyard is a tranquil oasis complete with resident tortoise and 3 chameleons and at night is the perfect spot to enjoy one one the Riad's delicious dinners (make sure you do this at least once during your stay - it was the best meal of our holiday).  All this plus a wonderful roof terrace with pool where you can enjoy a perfect breakfast.  Huge thank you to Didier and the Houdou team for making our stay so memorable.

All of the staff at the riad went out of their way to help us and ensure we felt safe and at home during our stay. Our room was brilliant and had a huge bath within it - an added bonus for us. The rooftop area is lovely and allows for you to sunbathe swim and relax after being in the busy Madina. You also get daily breakfast on the terrace as well which is just a lovely additional part of the stay. Nothing was a problem and we are so grateful for staying in a place where anyone would do anything to help us.

Since the moment we walked in we were offered mint tea and homemade pastries and Samira and Abdel as well as the owners Eric and Didier made our stay exceptional. Eric went over the map of the city and walked us towards the medina so we wouldn't get lost which we really appreciated. Riad is located about a 10-minute walk to Jemee Al-Fna and very convenient.    We stayed in the Tajine room which was lovely and cozy and the bathroom was great. We had a private view over the small pool and it was very quiet.    We had dinner at the Riad on our first day as we didn't feel like venturing out after a full day of travel. It was delicious! The salad chicken and desert were great and the servers were super nice. Would highly suggest doing at least one meal here. The breakfast was no different up on the terrace we got a great variety of Moroccan breads jams and eggs with freshly squeezed orange juice.

The property is very tastefully decorated with great attention to detail. We booked the room with the private pool as a treat after three days of golfing (based at another hotel). OMG - it was well worth the extra room rate cost. Very comfortable bed; Hot water as required; Luxurious towels; Safe; Unlimited wifi; Cute welcome treats and water were much appreciated.    Dinner and breakfast were delicious and highly recommended especially after having been out in the hustle and bustle of the Medina during the day. It was like being in a different world of peace and tranquility. Pre-dinner drinks (alcoholic or otherwise) can be had and the Moroccan wine was very tasty.

So now finally there is time to think again at our exceptional stay in Riad Houdou. I stayed there on a short vacation with my son. We had arranged a pickup at the airport which is an absolute must as getting to the Riad in the Marrakech Medina can be quite confusing and overwhelming. Our most gracious host Abdel and his staff did everything to make us feel at home in the beautiful oasis of tranquility that the Riad is. A delicious dinner ready for us when we arrived. In the morningafter a delightful breakfast on the rooftop Abdel made sure to familiarize us with the Medina’s layout. He walked with us pointing out landmarks so we could easily find our way back.    We loved Marrakech the crowds the noise the exotic feel of it made it a great experience. Getting back to the Riad leaving behind the chaos in the street felt superbly relaxing.

The staff were always on hand to give advice and suggestions as to how to get the best experience from Marrakech and they are a real friendly bunch. We stayed in a junior suite which gave us our own private patio with lots of shade and seating or lying down options. The rooftop terrace had several quite private areas as well where you could dry off after a dip in the pool and drinks were brought up for us on demand. If you are seeking a real Moroccan experience rather than just a taste then this is the place for you. It is set down a quiet side road just off the busy souks area.

I opted to have dinner there two of the nights I stayed and the food was delicious. Breakfast served on the roof terrace was also lovely. I felt that I was getting a taste of local food rather than the generic breakfast you might get in a bigger hotel. The location was perfect convenient for walking to sights and shopping but also quiet in the evenings. I booked a massage and hammam on my last night.

Riad Houdou,abekool19 wrote a review Jun 2019,50,"Excellent location, hosts and accommodations!",The Riad was a total delight! The hosts were fantastic and were always on hand to provide directions insights or just a laugh. The beautiful building and rooms had every detail thought of and covered and it was incredibly comfy. We stayed for 4 days and paid extra for the room with the personal pool (totes worth it!) for those hot days in the Medina! Would also definitely recommend the massage and hamam that they have in house. Everything was super affordable and the dinner they made for us one night was delicious. It was a home away from home and we'd definitely return!,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abekool19

Riad Houdou,Annith wrote a review May 2019,50,A Haven,Have to agree with other glowing reviews. This is a great place. We stayed for a week (in the Tarbouche room which was very comfortable beautifully decorated and like everywhere else in the riad always spotlessly clean) Didier talked us through the sights of Marrakech when we arrived and then took us out to show us the route towards Jemaa el Fna. He and Eric speak excellent English which made me very lazy about practising my French!    Some personal comments which may not have been mentioned elsewhere: We found the roftop terrace with its deightful pool a blessing and used both a lot. I admit I struggled with the crowds motorbikes and fumes of Marrakech and also with witnessing the casual abuse of animals. But as soon as you walk through the door of this riad peace descends.    Its a real test of hosts when something outside the ordinary occurs. I was unwell for most of my stay with a flare-up of an old problem. The staff could not have been kinder or more helpful. Didier even went to the pharmacy with my partner to act as interpreter. I was struggling to eat so normal meals would have been wasted. But our hosts at Riad Houdou happily provided a light - and delicious! - meal for me one evening at very short notice. The cooked a great meal for my partner at the same time and served both on the terrace rather than in the courtyard so I could eat in peace. And on our last day before a late flight home I felt so much at home that I had no qualms about spending the day just snoozing on the long bench on the terrace or a sun-lounger. It was all very much appreciated and made all the difference.    We both used the hammam and I had a wonderful massage from the lovely calming Mona. Both highly recommended. And hats off to Mona for working in that heat in full robes while not even permitted a drink of water it being Ramadan...!    We were also impressed by the efficiency of the arrival and departure service. Taxis arranged by the riad arrived exactly when they said they would and the baggage cart was ready and waiting - and speedy.    Summary: I would not go back to Marrakech for reasons above. Which is a shame because I definitely WOULD go back to Riad Houdou which felt like a real home throughout. It was always a relief to arrive back there. Thanks to Didier Eric the efficient Abdel and gentle helpful Aziz. And all the other staff.    Lastly: I assumed that the chameleon we were told lived in the trees in one of the two pretty courtyards was someone's little joke because -- ha ha! -- we never saw him. Until our penultimate day. You better believe it folks!: He is real.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Annith
Riad Houdou,Robert B wrote a review May 2019,50,Perfect place to stay in the Marrakesh Medina,This is a wonderful traditional riad with two beautiful courtyards and a series of spaces up on the roof on different levels some shaded and some not. I enjoyed both dinner served down in the main courtyard and breakfast served up on the roof. I also arranged for a massage which I can recommend it was great and helped my body after a long night and day of flights to get to Marrakesh. Eric and Didier and their staff are extremely friendly and helpful. It's also in a good location down a very quiet narrow path but near enough to the action. There are plenty of stairs to contend with so this would not be a good place for someone for whom climbing stairs is difficult. Otherwise I couldn't recommend it more highly.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled solo,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertB11703

Riad Houdou,roman wrote a review May 2019,50,Perfect stay in Marrakesh!,Riad Houdou is just lovely!    You can see and feel how much love the owners put into their hotel.  Once you arrived it feels immediately like home.    The staff of the hotel is the best we experienced in Morocco kind and helpful. 10/10    The rooms are beautiful! The rooftop is spectacular the food is more than great! We had the best tajine (and you will have a lot of those when visiting morocco) at the dinner in the riad. 10/10    Since it was our first visit of morocco the owners gave us a lot of tipps and helpful advises - we would have gone lost without them for sure.    Its a quiet place in a noisy and crowded city the perfect place to recover from a busy day. The rooftop pool will help you to cool down after a hot day in the streets of Marrakesh.

Riad Houdou,DKF808 wrote a review May 2019,50,A respite in a stormy sea,Eric & Didier have done a wonderful job with Riad Houdou. It's beautiful and extremely comfortable. Lots of nooks and crannies to relax in after a hectic day in the medina. There are so many places to explore within.  Upon arrival you are served a delicious Moroccan mint tea as you sit down with one of the owners to get an intro to a Riad and the Moroccan culture. You get a map along with an explanation situating you at the Riad along with directions on how to navigate the medina. Very thorough. Then you are given a tour of the place. It's bigger than you'd expect with library extra courtyard rooftop dipping pool deck other rooms to relax in etc. On your first excursion out someone will walk you around pointing out landmarks for you to remember that will keep you from getting lost in the confusing alleyways.  Overall a very nice experience...but don't believe the story about the chameleon in the courtyard citrus trees!!

Riad Houdou,B13London wrote a review May 2019,50,Don’t book anywhere else!,My husband and I had a wonderful stay at Riad Houdou for 5 nights. We took advantage of the pre booked taxi to/from airport with the Riad. The Riad is about 30mins drive from the airport and about 10-15 mins walk to the Main Square and souks. We was welcomed with mint tea and pastries and then showed around the Riad. We was then given information regarding the area and even showed us the way to the main square. We stayed in the Tagine room which was clean and comfortable. The breakfast was delicious and two of the mornings the chef (sorry forgot his name) made us breakfast an hour early as we had tours booked. We had dinner at the Riad on our first night and also was well worth it. The roof terrace has a small pool which was refreshing after a day of wandering around the city.    Eric Didier and the team were amazing. They made us feel very welcomed and nothing was too much trouble for them. It was like home from home.

Riad Houdou,Francesca wrote a review May 2019,50,Tranquil retreat for a busy weekend city break,The Riad is absolutely beautiful. We couldn't believe how quiet it was considering the busy road that the entrance leads up to.    Our room was lovely on the smaller side but really nicely decorated with small touches such as fresh flowers and tasty pastries on arrival. I did find the room lighting quite dark but it would be nothing that would impact giving this place top marks.    Food wise the breakfast was delicious - fresh fruit yoghurt eggs. We ate in the Riad one of the evenings and this was the best food of our trip. I had chicken with pasta and cinnamon - decided to give it a go even though out of my comfort zone and it was the best decision of the trip! Especially with the extra icing sugar on top (don't mock it till you've tried it!).    Finally Didier and Eric were amazing.

Fantastic breakfasts and dinners - so delicious! Beautiful rooftop with pool to cool off in the hot Moroccan sun. Our rooms were beautifully decorated and calming.

Riad Houdou,jenniferlee23 wrote a review Apr 2019,50,Wonderful Stay at Riad Houdou!,I recently stayed at Riad Houdou and I had a great experience. The atmosphere is beautiful calming and serene in the Riad. Outside the Riad there is a lot of life but once you're inside you forget about the bustle outside. I loved the décor it felt super cozy and was in a great location close to attractions.  Staff was some of the best I've ever experienced. Upon arrival the Riad has you settle in with tea and homemade treats and they let you know the history of the Riad. This is one of the most immersive and hospitable experiences I've had at a hotel if not the most informative. They give you so much helpful information that was very much appreciated. After checking in they show you around the Riad's common areas. The grounds are beautiful and calming. The room we stayed in was the one with the tagines on the wall. The room was clean and had very thoughtful touches. You can tell there is a lot of time and care put into the Riad. The Riad truly offers a garden experience. I loved the natural elements.  Breakfast was great consisting of delicious homemade baked goods yogurt tea juice preserves and fruit. The rooftop patio is very pretty and is great to take in some sun or the beautiful Moroccan sunset. We didn't get a chance to use the pool but wished we would've.

Riad Houdou,jonathanxm3 wrote a review Mar 2019,50,A true oasis in the souk,Abdel and team have done a tremendous job at welcoming us at every point of our stay.    We booked a taxi ride from the airport to the Riad and Mohammed was right on time as we exited the airport. During the short drive to the souk Mohammed pointed a couple of places worth visiting before handing us over to another guide as cars are only allowed up to a certain point in the souk.    We have booked the Superior Junior suite with private patio and cooling pool (which we didn't get to use because the weather was still too cool indoor and the pool wasn't heated)—we soon discover that even though the patio and pool are inside our locked area there's a balcony above our suite that acts as an access point to the room above ours. Even though above guests couldn't access our patio or pool they could still look down with only banisters between us. The floor in our room were also a bit cold at night and in the morning. Bring a pair of sandals or slippers with you as they're not provided.    And that's really where the minus ends because everything else have been pluses (and more).    Abdel welcomed us with mint tea and a side of sweets a quick tour of the Riad and after we settled in our room showed us some places to visit on the map and even took us on a short walk through the souk to show us how to get in and out of the souk to the Riad.    Riad Houdou as a whole was immaculately looked after. It was spotless quiet and charming. The open rooftop pool makes for a lovely reprieve under the hot sun while the rooftop lounge area is a great reading spot (and breakfast area in the morning).    Our room was well looked after. It was cosy charming tidy and above all: clean. The bathroom took getting used to as it's a traditional riad bathroom. The room could get a bit wet as there's nothing closing off the shower however once we've gotten over our expectations for a western bathroom we quite enjoy the experience. All toiletries have lovely orange blossom oil in them which we will forever associate with Marrakech from now on : )    The meals we've had in the Riad have been one of the best ones we've had during our trip. We had one dinner at the Riad and wished we had done more evenings in. The breakfast was a great start to our day. Never had a more delicious breakfast spreads: excellent yoghurt tasty bread and butter with pan fried pastries that change every morning and of course a choice of hot beverage.    When Abdel and team offered to serve our breakfast much earlier in the morning of our last day (to accommodate our early flight home) we didn't hesitate to accept—it was a high note to end our trip!    We also booked a day trip excursion to Imlil village from the Riad and everything was planned meticulously. We literally did not have to worry about a thing: from the morning taxi ride the mule ride lunch and scenery the excursion was something to behold and remember.    Overall for a memorable stay in Marrakech make sure you spend your nights in Riad Houdou.    Don't skip breakfast and have more dinner in the Riad—you'll love the food and the ambiance.

Riad Houdou,L Zhu wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Oasis of Peace inside the Medina,We stayed 4 nights in February in a twin room on the ground room and our experience is near perfection. Arriving from a Sahara tour the Riad is difficult to find even for our driver. Once we arrived the Riad is amazingly peaceful compared to the crazy Moqf souks just metres away. Aziz and Abdul welcomed us and gave us a small tour of the Riad and some very important tips for visiting Marrakech. The Riad is impeccably presented with traditional Moroccan crafts everywhere and like the rest of the Medina a step back in time. The Riad is 5 minutes walk from Moqf square where you can get taxis and comfortable 15 minutes walk from Jemaa el Fna. Aziz Abdul and Ahmed alone with the rest of the staff are true ambassadors for Moroccan hospitality and made our stay really special.    Our room was beautifully decorated with traditional decor and comfortable. A little on the small side they use every corner of the room to make it beautiful and cozy. The wifi is stable and fast in the room. The only issue with our room though is it is right beside the dinner/smoking lounge so sometimes it might be hard to have an early sleep. The housekeeping in the Riad is one of the best I ever seen. They really go above and beyond to organise your belongings and make you want to return to the Riad.    Breakfast is served on their balcony - a nice combination of homemade jams pastries and perfectly cooked eggs. We had hamman at the Riad with Mona - a relaxing way to end our journey in Morocco. Overall Riad Houdou is the best accommodation we had during our 12 days in Morocco.

The staff will do anything to make your stay as comfortable as possible and will take their time to explain all there is to know about Marrakech.

Riad Houdou,Linda205 wrote a review Feb 2019,50,It's like staying in a palace!,We had been warned that staying in a riad may be risky but we found the Riad Houdou to be an amazing place. We have traveled to many countries and we think this place is absolutely best place we have ever stayed at. The whole place is beautiful the entire staff is to be commended for their hospitality. They have a wonderful breakfast on the rooftop. Be sure to request dinner at least one night. If they know you want dinner they go to the market to buy food so you know you are getting the freshest ingredients. Wonderful food in a wonderful ambience. Abdel is a wonderful host and showed us how to find our way around. You can stay at a hotel that looks like any hotel in USA or you can go for an authentic Moroccan experience by staying here at the most lovely Riad Houdou!

My sister and I have dietary needs and they provided delicious home-made food for us (hats off to the chef.) The Riad was so calming that I just wanted to spend my whole day there and they also have the best mint tea in Marrakesh!  Our room was clean spacious and smelled like flowers. It was our first time in Marrakesh so the staffs there were very helpful and gave us great tips on how to get around and deal with people outside.

Riad Houdou,Wendy R wrote a review Feb 2019,50,Great Experience,Excellent service all round for this riad. We stayed here for five nights in January for a short visit to Morocco. The owners Eric and Didier have put a lot of care into this riad and their staff is great - so friendly and helpful. Breakfast is served up on the roof and it is delicious and fresh - particularly loved the fresh yogurt. We had dinner two nights and it was excellent. Particularly memorable was an amazing deconstructed mille feuilles for dessert. The portions were huge. They were careful to make sure we knew the way to the main plaza. The tea room was charming but felt a little musty but I think it was due to the cold outside as the windows were closed and it wasn't getting fresh air. Also the bed on one side was not that comfortable (was not the side I was sleeping on). All in all a really pleasant experience and would definitely recommend it.,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zozozoe

Riad Houdou,Paul D wrote a review Feb 2019,50,Calm inside the Medina walls,Thanks to the Tripadvisor reviews we found this Riad for a five night stay in Marrakesh. Behind the front door is a quiet haven from the hustle and bustle of the Medina. The owners Didier and Eric and their team are charming welcoming and extremely helpful which helped make our stay so positive. We would recommend the day out in the Atlas Mountains but be aware the trek could be tough for some as it is mountainous terrain. We ate in the Riad most evenings as the chef is excellent and once again lovely to stay in the calm of the Riad after a day sightseeing. Our room was basic but could be improved by having more ventilation in the bathroom and better quality bedding but these are two minor negatives compared to the many positives of Riad Houdou.,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/90PaulD90
Riad Houdou,DeeandLolo wrote a review Jan 2019,50,Amazing hospitality,My husband and I spent a long weekend here and it was just fantastic.    Riad is located inside the Médina but on a quiet off shoot. The owners and staff are incredibly welcoming and attentive. When you arrive to the Road you are greeted by the owner and he takes time to explain the things to you. The next morning the other owner took time to orient us in the Médina even going so far as to walk is toward the main square.    We had two dinners and breakfast everyday. The dinners were traditional tangine and savory. The breakfasts included homemade yogurt fruit fresh squeezed orange juice and coffee/tea along with some type of pastry. Also a choice of eggs. The food was very good and satisfying.    Our room was the Tea Room and it looks just like the pictures. It also has an enormous bathtub for soaking that we took advantage of.    We also booked an excursion through the Riad to the Atlas Mountains. What a great memory for us and the people we met were so welcoming and helpful.

We were so well looked after by Didier and Eric and the Riad team from the start to the end of our stay. Mint tea and sweet pastries on arrival with a warm welcome in the 'Garden of heaven"" courtyard sitting under the orange trees. Our rooms were very comfortable and exquisitely decorated in a celebration of Morrocan culture combined with the French eye for contemporary design. (We loved the Theiere Room and fresh flowers abound! everywhere!) A lovely breakfast is served on the roof terrace but we seldom saw the sun rise as we slept so well! On our first day Didier even accompanied us along the route from the Riad to the Fna Square to give us our bearings and provided information and advice on good places to visit and to eat out although we also ate an evening meal at the Riad (delicious home cooked traditional Morrocan dishes!).

From sitting us down on arrival and aiding us with competing paperwork touring the riad itself giving some tips regarding the local customs and behaviours showing sights and locations on a map and then guiding my partner and myself to Jmaa el fna so we wouldn't get lost. The room we had (babouche) was lovely and comfortable and had all the basic amenities we required. Breakfast was nice and left us felling full for the whole morning with the homemade yoghurt being mouthwateringly good. The location is excellent being less than a ten minute walk to the souls or the square at not busy times. My partner had a hammam and massage and I have been informed by her authority that it was relaxing and felt great. Finally they were accomodating with the provision of an early breakfast as we had to check out early.

First of all they sat and talked with us upon our arrival and shared mint tea and some pastries. After we had settled into our room Abdel actually walked with us most of the way to Jemaa el Fna Square pointing out landmarks so that we would know how to return to the hotel upon our return. It is a lovely 15 minute walk to the square. We had also emailed them prior to our arrival to arrange a day trip to Essaouira and they were extremely responsive and sure enough it was all arranged for 8:30 AM the following morning. They had also arranged for our breakfast to be served to us at 8 so that we didn't miss it. Every day we were greeted with a smile each time we encountered every single person who worked at the Riad. The breakfast every morning was really delicious and served on the rooftop terrace which was really a lovely experience. After a long day running around seeing the sights of Marrakech we were always welcomed back to the Riad with a nice conversation about our day and friendly answers to all of our questions.

Riad Houdou,JPendorfs wrote a review Oct 2018,50,"Riad Houdou, an oasis in Marrakech",My wife and I had the pleasure of staying at the Riad Houdou on a recent trip to Morocco.    Didier and Eric were so kind and extremely helpful. Before we’d even arrived in the country we had communicated via email made our booking and arranged transportation from the airport to the Riad. Easy!    When we arrived we were greeted by their super friendly staff and served delicious Mint Tea and pastries. Didier took the time to take us into the Medina to show us the way to the main square so we wouldn’t get lost which was really helpful!    We booked ahead to have dinner at the Riad on our first night in Morocco. We knew we would be tired and just wanted to relax. Our dinner was fantastic and it was perfectly vegetarian as requested! The Moroccan soup was so good we had seconds!    The Riad Houdou is a beautiful oasis in the heart of the Marrakesh Medina and decorated to perfection! Riad Houdou is so special and treated us so well it was hard to leave. If we ever get the chance to visit again we will definitely be staying here!,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Los Angeles, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JPendorfs

It was wonderful to escape the citys busy streets and relax by the pool for some hours during the day. Our room was also really nice. The staff and the owners were so pleasant and helpful!

Riad Houdou,Aimee L wrote a review Oct 2018,50,Absolutely amazing!,Me and my partner have just come back from our brief but fabulous visit to Marrakesh. Eric and Didier made our stay all the more memorable with their stunning riad. Excellent location 10 minute walk from the main square and all the action. When we arrive in Marrakesh Didier had arranged for a driver to meet us at the airport. It was door to door service which was fantastic in the busy medina. Didier sat with us and over a mint tea talked us through some local hints and tips to help us not get too lost (although in the souks getting lost is half the fun!). We were even accompanied to the main square on our first visit which was very reassuring and helpful.  We had dinner at the riad on our first night. Wow! What a feast! The riad is just beautiful. So peaceful and relaxing; the perfect place to go back to after a busy day exploring. I know a few people have mentioned the breakfasts. SO good! Home made and so tasty. The ideal way to start the day.  I will always recommend anyone to stay at riad Houdou and we will definitely be back.

Riad Houdou,Alex wrote a review Sep 2018,50,Our best Riad in all of Morocco!,While we can't compare against other Riads in Marrakesh we stayed in 8 riads all around Morocco and this was THE BEST! The owners care and it shows. There's attention to detail the whole staff is happy to assist from breakfast to bedtime. They provide insightful advice and information without trying to sell services taxis or guides as we experienced in other riads.  The rooms are cozy comfortable and nicely decorated. My wife took advantage of the rooftop refreshing small pool and terrace. And we enjoyed mint tea in the garden on the afternoon while cooling down from a day of wandering in the city. Breakfast is healthy and fulfilling.  We took a night trip to Essaouira and we could leave our baggage here.  Location is convenient as taxis can get as close as 200mts from the Riad. It is close to some attractions and only a 15 to 20 minute easy walk from Jamaa al Fna.  One night our daughter didn't feel like going out for supper and they offered to serve her an omelette in our room free of charge! We didn't ask for it they offered. They made our 4 night stay in Marrakesh feel like at home and would love to go back there any day.

Cool despite the heat outside but with a/c & ceiling fans. Both Didier & Eric plus their attentive staff were always on hand to answer questions & make suggestions.

The riad itself is superbly decorated features a rooftop pool and has a nice library/patio.

Riad Houdou,Andrew S wrote a review Jul 2018,50,A true oasis in Marrakesh,We stayed two nights at the extraordinary Riad Houdou for our (far too short) time in Marrakesh. Abdel was a consummate host and greeted our arrival with such warmth and care that we truly felt at home. The entire staff were exceptional with a special thank you to Azziz for guiding us through our first dinner in Marrakesh taken at the Riad one of the highlights of our trip. The food is excellent the riad is both well-appointed and very cosy and I cannot recommend a stay here highly enough.    If you are arriving from the airport with no Moroccan currency the Riad can arrange a private airport transport (taxi) which you pay when you settle your bill at check-out - a nice touch we took advantage of and greatly appreciated.    As well wine and beer (very reasonably priced) were available at the Riad which was also a perk.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A2810RXandrews

From the moment we booked the Riad Houdou Didier answered all my questions in detail and was so accommodating for all our needs. He was away during our stay but the staff of Abdel and Aziz were so incredible and customer oriented and had a constant smile on their face. If you want an authentic experience stay at this Riad and you will be in an oasis of calm. The rooms have great air condition are well appointed and the ambience is charming. The rooftop plunge pool is great to cool off. Best of all were the meals. The breakfasts had a good assortment of yogurts fruit pancakes and breads. The dinners were freshly cooked each day and highly recommended. Marrakech is one of the most unique cities you will visit with great architecture energy and people. The Riad will help you book daily excursions outside the city to see more of Morocco.

We arrived at night had arrranged airport pick up and this worked well. We were driven to an entrance to the medina that was fairly close to the Riad. There a fellow with a cart loaded our luggage and led us to the Riad which was only a 5 minute walk away. We were welcomed by one if the owners in the central courtyard where we enjoyed mint tea and delicious home made sweets while checking in. Each room is decorated in a different unique style. Our room was the Fez one of the smaller room with two twin beds and delightful decor including more than a dozen Fez hats of the wall. Everything was clean the beds were comfortable and we slept well. Breakfast on the roof top terrace was outstanding French crepes  homemade yogurt fresh strawberries eggs bread fresh juice. All very good. After breakfast the owner took us for a walk to the main square to help us get oriented and that was so helpful. We also booked a tour to the Atlas mountains through the Riad and that worked quite well although it was somewhat different from what had been described. But nevertheless we had a very good guide and private driver which gave us lots of flexibility to spend as long as we wished at the various stops.,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Edmonton, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PicMorDaisies

He also showed us how to get around the Médina which was very helpful as it can be overwhelming to navigate on your own at first.    The riad itself is beautifully decorated and so peaceful. I looked forward coming back to the riad after a long day of exploring. My favorite spot in the Riad is the roof top area as there are swimming pool and places to hang out.

They organised a transfer from the airport met us with mint tea and cakes and explained everything about the riad and how to get to the main sites of Marrakech. Abdul brought us to the famous square the first time.  I asked for and acted on dinner recommendations which they kindly booked.  Breakfast was delicious every morning beds were supremely comfortable as was the amazing bathroom and bath. I really enjoyed cooling off in the pool after a hot day. But what I will remember most about the riad was the tranquillity of it after the buzz of the street. its immediate neighbourhood was full of ordinary people going about their daily lives.

Riad Houdou,diveannie wrote a review May 2018,50,Wonderful place!,Eric & Didier have created an oasis of calm amongst the madness of Marrakech. The Riad is absolutely beautiful. Communication before our visit was great transfers were arranged for us and we had a lovely welcome of mint tea and sweets on our arrival prior to a delicious meal. Breakfasts were lovely - different pancakes or pastries daily fresh fruit and the tastiest homemade yoghurt ever.  We were shown in person how to get to the main square (it seems a bit intimidating at first but just go with it - this is the 'real' Marrakech!) and the best place to change money. The Riad is perfectly placed - it only takes 10 minutes walk or so to the main square (depending which way you go) just remember to keep to the right and watch out for bikes.  There is a rooftop pool available - it was a godsend on the one hot day we had plus we had it to ourselves which was lovely. For anyone missing their cat whilst on holiday the resident cat is gorgeous too!  Thanks again Eric Didier Abdel Aziz with the smile and all the staff for your help & friendliness - we loved our stay with you!,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sunderland, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/diveannie
Riad Houdou,Alex P wrote a review May 2018,50,Wonderful Stay at the Riad!,I highly recommend staying at Riad Houdou if you are visiting Marrakesh. Staying at a riad is a service-oriented experience and Didier and Eric and their wonderful staff provided excellent service at all hours of the day and night.    Some of the services that we indulged in:  * Pickup and drop off from the airport  * Early check-in  * Welcome tea and pastries upon arrival  * Walking introduction to the Medina  * Fresh cooked dinner at the riad  * Fresh cooked breakfast at the riad (included)  * Alcoholic beverages brought to our room  * Couples massage    Some of those things cost extra (airport taxi dinner massage) but were reasonably priced.    One of the most helpful services they provided was the introduction to the Medina (the neighborhood area / market) of Marrakesh. It is incredibly easy to get lost but Dider gave us a map and told us to download an app called MAPS.ME which helped tremendously with getting around. Then he walked us to the main square pointing out the route back to the riad. We were able to find our way back to the riad after lunch just by going off his directions.    We stayed in the Babouches room which I recommend because it has it's own patio yet is still affordable. There were a couple leaks in the windows when it rained and we hadn't shut the windows all the way before we left but it wasn't too bad. The shower was nice and hot and the A/C worked well. We loved the room.    Enjoy Morocco and stay at Riad Houdou and you will have a great time guaranteed. Marrakesh may be a bit of a culture shock and you may get easily lost but be sure to install that MAPS.ME app and save the Marrakesh map to your phone. We never once had to pay a guide to help us find our way and I owe it all to that app (and Didier's directions).,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Denver, Colorado",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexP7638

From arranging a porter to take our bags from car to riad tasty dinners clean and comfortable surroundings delicious breakfasts on the roof and arranging for an early massage in the very nicely appointed spa room it was a memorable stay! The streets surrounding the riad are part of the what I consider the real medina - everyday folk shopping and walking about. Not touristy but safe and atmospheric.

Riad Houdou,David W wrote a review Apr 2018,50,"Very warm welcome and helpful service, good location",We were given a very warm welcome by Eric and later by Didier. Having arrived in the evening our information session with Abdel was held in the morning and included a very useful map and finally being guided to Djemaa el Fna. Riad Houdou has been enhanced with many decorative and ornamental features including the naming of each room according to collections of Moroccan objects on the wall. We did feel that perhaps fewer ornaments in our room which was quite small would have given more useful space. We did appreciate the electric heater the aircon that provided warm air for a cool evening and the kettle and cups. Breakfasts were enjoyable being taken either in the courtyard or the roof terrace and included several home made items such as yogurt. The location had advantages - being on the east side of the medina we could walk easily to Djemaa el Fna and on to the Bahia Palace yet also across the top of the medina to the Jardin Majorelle. Nearby having negotiated the rather frantic covered souk a quiet street led to several museums including the interesting Museum of Photography as well as some good restaurants.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Huddersfield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/710DavidW710

The Riad itself is in a great location for exploring the old city and is a beautiful and quiet retreat from the hustle and bustle of the souks. Breakfast on the terrace even in this chilly spring - was top notch. We had two suppers here during our four night stay - intimate atmosphere with excellent service and delicious meals.

Riad Houdou,clarejim01 wrote a review Apr 2018,50,Exceptional service from riad owners and staffs,The whole Houdou team took very good care of me and my boyfriend during our stay. We received an extremely warm welcome and introduction tour of the riad from Eric the owner when we checked in who was very nice and with a good sense of humor. We met Didier and Abdel the next morning who were also extremely helpful and friendly. Abdel gave us a briefing on the surrounding attractions gave us useful tips on bargaining skills and prices and insisted on walking us to the main square to make sure we know the direction.  We stayed in the Tajine room which was cozy spotless and nicely decorated. I was also very impressed with their breakfast which was the best we had in Morocco with homemade local pastries and guests have the option to have it on the rooftop which offers very good view. We also had dinner the first night we were there and I really enjoyed the soup. The main which was chicken tajine came in a very large portion but the meat could be more moist.  I felt that Eric and Didier are running a very impressive team especially when Abdel politely declined our tip after the walk to the main square and another staff who has served us dinner and drinks another night very attentively put the tip we gave him into the gratuity box for all staffs.

Riad Houdou,Markus M wrote a review Apr 2018,50,Best place throughout our stay in Morocco,We stayed in several riads in Marrakesh and Morocco though this was certainly by far the best one.    Staff  The staff is super friendly and the hosts Eric & Didier are really really helpful and hospitable.    Location  The riad itself is close to the main place Djeema El Fna and well located in a quiet side street of the souks.    Cleanliness and Interior  Everything was very clean and the interior was chosen very well and is tasteful throughout with a clear concept. Unfortunately the weather during our stay was a bit fresh for a little plunge in the rooftop pool.    Food  Breakfast on the rooftop terrace with view over Marrakesh was made freshly every day and in quality and quantity absolutely great. We also had a three-course dinner there which was worth every Dirham and certainly one culinary highlight of our journey.    Summary  All in all we would recommend this stay not even to family and close friends but to everyone reading this.

Eric is a lovely host who welcomed us with mint tea and incredible good pastry. He explained everything so well and even took his time to walk us halfway to the main place. The Riad itself is a beautiful old house that is decorated with much taste and love. We had a great room with a private terrace. Not only that the Riad itself is so wonderful so is the staff. The breakfast on the roof is also very tasteful it changes daily and consists of everything you can wish for. We also had dinner there and it was so so good. We only wanted to go there once but ended up eating there three times because it was so delicious and served in a beautiful ambiance. We also had a hammam and a massage which was also very good. We definitely recommend staying there and will definitely come back during our next trip to Marrakech. Dear Eric Didier and staff: thanks a lot for making our stay as wonderful as it was.

Once over the threshold we were inside a wonderfully scented tranquil space. Our charming hosts Eric and Didier were most welcoming and attentive as were all the staff. We were greeted with mint tea and shown to our beautifully decorated and comfortable room. Breakfast varied each morning and was a healthy offering of fruit homemade yoghurt and preserves local bakes and eggs.

Riad Houdou,alsithy wrote a review Feb 2018,50,Great staff !,"Booked 2 rooms in December. Although it would be fair to call them ""compact"" the rooms were functional and the beds comfortable. The evening meals were of good quality and quantity. It is understandable that the kitchen caters for a mixed bag of guests and seem to aim for a sort of neutral/middle-of-the-road taste experience. Personally we would have preferred to have tasted more of the many local spices in our food. If we revisit this Riad which we very much hope to do I am sure they would only be too pleased to cater to our taste-buds ! Breakfast on the roof terrace was on the sparse side but of good quality and varied slightly each day. The owners and staff are very friendly and nothing is too much trouble for them. We were treated like a cross between honoured guests and not-so-distant relations... which is perfect for this type of establishment. The list of WHY you should visit this Riad is quite long too long to list here. The list of negatives is so short as to be not really worth mentioning. The bottom line is that for a short break/long weekend the Riad Houdou is an ideal base from which to visit the streets of Marrakesh and a haven of semi-private peace to return to at the end of the day. The layout of the building means that noisy guests severely disturb all the other occupants of the Riad. We were lucky on 2 nights not so lucky (with 2 loud-mouthed drunk American ""ladies"" who were oblivious to the fact that no one but themselves were interested in their nonsensical midnight conversation... an intervention by the management wasn't forthcoming would have been welcome) but this can and does happen everywhere but in a place as small and this with inner courtyard-type areas in which every sound echoes one should be aware that late-night disturbances are a possibility. Lastly we can recommend the expert masseuse... you just need to be book a day or so in advance. All in all reasonable value for money. The main attribute is without doubt the wonderful staff - a reason in itself to visit the Riad Houdou.",Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,Bern,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alsithy

Adel took the time to sit with us and explain everything answering our questions and offering guidance on what to see helping organize our plans for the duration in Marrakeck. The Riad is a superb sanctuary with various balconies to relax. The food we had in Riad Houdou was the best in all of Morroco. The breakfast - with home made pancakes yogurt and jams. The dinner was a michelin quality served in a well appointed room with a fireplace. The team including Adel Shaima Aziz and the chefs were very kind and professional who went beyond the call of duty to make our stay a memorable experience. We used the massage and it was very nice.

I booked directly with the riad and the owners could not have been more helpful. I sent many emails to them over several months organising the trip and birthday treats for my husband while we were there they went above and beyond to assist me and answer my many questions! Their hospitality continued when we got to the riad as although the owners were actually on holiday when we were there we had a warm welcome from the staff and Abdel in particular was extremely helpful ensuring we had all the information we needed to navigate Marrakech. Nothing was too much trouble they organised a trip for us to Ouzoud waterfalls and transport to and from the airport so no need to worry about taxis upon arrival. We had a Hammam and my husband had a massage on his birthday and the chef made us a lovely meal and a birthday cake. They even got someone to make us breakfast on the day we were leaving even though it was at 5.15a.m.!! The riad is situated in the heart of the Medina so the only thing I would point out is that you need to be prepared for your surroundings when you first arrive as it can be a bit of a culture shock for us spoilt Brits! However if you want to be in the heart of Marrakech and get the full authentic experience this is the place to be.

Riad Houdou,NY10040 wrote a review Jan 2018,50,Beautiful Riad with Attentive Hosts,I stayed at Riad Houdou in December with a friend. From the moment they open the door you feel welcome and pampered. Marrakesh is an exciting and fun city but it can be exhausting and knowing I could return here at the end of a day made a big difference. We stayed in the well-appointed Spice Room which was plenty big for two people and is as lovely as it appears in pictures. The bathroom has two sinks (very convenient) and a separate shower and tub (huge). Breakfast is served every morning on the roof and it was always delicious the home-made yogurt was particularly noteworthy. My friend and I had dinner in the riad on the day of our arrival and can I honestly say it was the best tagine I had the entire time I was in Morocco. The primary language European language of the staff owners and in fact most of Morocco (Tangier excluded) is French but everyone made a great effort to speak English to us and it was appreciated. Both my friend and I had a hammam and massage in the riad itself and it was a great way to begin our travels back home. Eric and Didier are very generous hosts -- always making sure we knew where we were going (easy to get lost) arranging tours and giving suggestions on things to do.

Riad Houdou,John V wrote a review Jan 2018,50,Best Riad in Marrakech,Eric Vaillant & Didier Truffot Co-owners in Riad Houdou; where do I begin?  Well why not start at the Marrakech International Airport.Upon arrival we were greeted by our driver who whisked us away to the famed Medina. Our bags were loaded onto a cart and we followed an old man on a mystery tour of narrow streets and laneways to our Riad. First impressions of the famed walled town can be over whelming to the new....But my advice just go with it and enjoy. We arrived at the end of a lane filled with character to find a beautiful carved door. Eric was there to greet us. Entering the Riad was like entering Paradise a stunning 3 story courtyard with fruiting Citrus trees fountain and an atmosphere that made our collective blood pressure drop to rarely seen levels. We were shown around which included a tour of the roof-top area. There we viewed a site that shall forever remain etched in my mind. The Snow covered Atlas Mountains a mere 80 Kilometres away. The site was inspiring. And our room beautiful and atmospheric. But the food!!!!!!! Breakfast fit for a King on the Terrace and different every day. I have not had a nicer breakfast. And then the evening meal worthy of at least 0ne Michelin Star seriously......Top-shelf....imaginative and really well prepared. The best Moroccan food I have ever had. And Eric and Didier are the quintessential Hosts. They make you feel welcome and appreciated yet they are also discreet........I implore anyone considering a stay in the Medina to stay here you will have no regrets.

Owners Eric and Didier assisted by the kind Abdel couldn't be more welcoming and generous with their time to ensure we were comfortable and at ease maneuvering through the medina and back to the riad. They also helped with dinner reservations and shared shopping tips when we sought them.The riad has a cool cozy feel with nicely appointed rooms none the same. We stayed in the family room the first night which was great for four. The next nights we split up into two rooms because that room was booked. The beds were comfortable the decor tasteful. The atrium/courtyard area is pretty and peaceful. Breakfast served on the terrace overlooking the medina is plentiful and pleasant. Despite being small Riad Houdou offers hammam scrub and massage which we enjoyed in the impeccably clean spa. There's a dipping pool which looked appealing but it was winter.

Riad Houdou,earanheim wrote a review Dec 2017,50,Fantastic place with fantastic and friendly service,"We stayed for a few days in late December with 4 grown children. The owners were home for Xmas in France but prior to our visit Didier was extremely helpful in setting up transport from the airport (suggested if this is your first visit to Marrakech) and a one day outing in the Atlas mountains. In their place Ahmed was hosting and could not have been more helpful friendly and enjoyable. Really can't say enough about him. As we were staying over xmas eve and xmas evening the Riad hosted a xmas dinner for all the guests. The dinner was fantastic and their efforts to make it festive were great - excellent local music and one of the staff dressed up as a twerking Santa Claus (you had to be there but was hysterical and will remain one of our family's best xmas memories). Rooms are very nicely done. Breakfast on the roof terrace is fantastic with home made breads yoghurt and jams. My 16 year old son said ""That was best tea best yoghurt and best jam I've ever had."" The location is good - easy walk to the square and only a couple blocks to the edge of the medina for taxi access. 3-4 blocks to photography museum or dyer's souk.",Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Madison, Wisconsin",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/earanheim
Riad Houdou,Luke O wrote a review Dec 2017,50,No words can describe how amazing this place is!,As my title suggests this Riad is incredible the hospitality is beyond anything I've ever experienced! From the second I left the airport I felt relaxed as I was transported safely to the Riad with Mint Tea and cakes introduced to the Houdou and the staff and then walked into town.  The room was clean tidy and adequate for me and my friend to stay in. We regularly ended up coming back to Riad just to chill for an hour or so from the adventures of the manic Marrakesh streets!  Finally the breakfast every morning was delicious filled us up for the days adventuring and varied every day!  Our thanks go out to Didier and Eric and the incredible staff who made our stay so relaxing. I have and would recommend this Riad to anybody travelling to Marrakech!,Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lukeo498
Riad Houdou,KSunshine234 wrote a review Dec 2017,50,Treated Me Like Family,I cannot say enough positive things about Riad Houdou. I was collected right on time at the airport welcomed to the riad by Didier who took so much of his own time to show me the map of the media and chat with me. Then they walked me to the main square so I could get my bearings and I came back each evening to a lovely dinner and comfy room.    Both Didier and Eric the owners were fantastically helpful and friendly. However as I visited during the holidays I only was with them one day as they went to visit family. We were left in the care of their excellent staff and I cannot say enough good things about them!    Delicious breakfasts kind attentive they really care about their guests and it shows. They were friendly and so nice to talk to. I had a hammam and massage appointment and it was heavenly!    Christmas Eve they served one of the most amazing meals I've ever had so delicious served along with traditional music and dancing--even a visit from Santa. Everyone enjoyed the evening so much and I felt like I was with family and very cared for.    The owners and staff at Riad Houdou work very hard it's very obvious that they care about their guests I've never had this kind of hospitality anywhere and I've visited almost 50 countries. The riad itself is really beautiful decorated in a gorgeous Moroccan style.    I could go on and on but I have nothing but positive things to say and I wish them continued success and my most sincere thanks for their care and for ensuring that my time in Marrakech was amazing.

Riad Houdou,Nikki C wrote a review Dec 2017,50,Fantastic and very welcoming,We stayed here for 2 nights at the beginning of our two week trip. It was a perfect way to begin our adventure in Morocco.  We opted to get picked up from the airport our driver was waiting for us kindly pointed out some things in the city.  When we arrived at the riad someone came to take our bags right away and we were brought to the beautiful courtyard for some mint tea and pastries. We did a quick check in were given some time to freshen up and then our wonderful host gave us a map of the Médina and explain what to see how to get there and some genera tips. He personally walked us to the heart of the Médina making sure we could find our way back.    Breakfast on the rooftop terrace was amazing everything was homemade and absolutely delicious. We also had dinner one night at the riad which was an incredibly flavourful beef and tomato tangine- one of the best meals we had in Morocco!    This riad is fantastic the people were so very welcoming and helpful and the actual riad was beautiful and tranquil- a calm inside the bustling city.

Riad Houdou,pat p wrote a review Dec 2017,50,Outstanding Adventure,Other reviewers have said it all: let me add to the chorus of travelers who have found their stay here to have been an outstanding experience. From initiating my reservation to our arrival and stay at the riad Eric and Didier and their staff Aziz Abdel and their fabulous culinary staff all were most welcoming and helpful. Our first day felt bewildering but Didier walked us to the popular spots including money exchange recommended restaurants and facilitated a Hammam experience and massage which surpassed my expectations. Our room was largeclean and comfortable. The shower was hot and fully powered. The breakfasts were filling and varied and made extra special by the delightful staff who were eager to please.

Riad Houdou,Cyprian C wrote a review Dec 2017,50,Blissful Experience,This was our first hotel/Riad at which we spent 2 nights in at the beginning of our 2 week trip in Morocco. It was absolutely amazing.    Comparing it to many other hotels/roads that we resided in during our travels this rates as one of the top ones.    Highly recommend the pick up from the airport made things so easy and seamless. Driver waiting promptly bags taken care of and walked right to the hotel. The narrow busy streets markets and canopy covered streets would make it challenging to navigate there if you have never experienced the streets of Marrakech.    The staff was genuine friendly welcoming informative and very funny. They sat us down after a warm welcome with a map and showed us some must sees gave us informative tips about being first timers to Marrakech and even walked us down to the main market showing us all the landmarks to follow when getting back - after that navigation was a breeze.    The in house dinner was fantastic and one of the best ones during our travels - well worth it. Furthermore their breakfast was amazing and served on the rooftop while you watch the sun come up.    Highly recommend this Riad absolutely amazing and her favourite this entire trip.

The place was well thought out and decorated which gave the place a calm and warm atmosphere compare to other parts of Marrakech. The rooms were meticulously clean and bright and the shower had great water pressure and hot water. After spending a month traveling around Morroco I can easily say that they had the best breakfast I had on the whole trip and if you get the chance I would recommend having dinner at the Raid the chef is outstanding.

Beautiful interior with plants and fountains.    We were greeted with Moroccan tea some sweet treats and fantastic hospitality. After being shown to our room we were given advice on things to see in the local area and were walked to the square (shown landmarks along the way to make sure we'd know how to find our way back.

Riad Houdou,Shazia wrote a review Nov 2017,50,Best riad in Marrakech!,My wife and I stayed at the Riad Houdou for a week in November – we had an amazing time in Marrakech and staying at the Riad Houdou made it extra special. The riad is located in the oldest part of the medina and is only a short walk from some of the main sights and souks.    The staff at the riad were amazing – Didier and Eric (who run the riad) were such great hosts and from the minute we arrived nothing was too much trouble. There is a real family feel among the staff at the riad – Aziz Abdel Rania (the super-talented chef) were just so lovely. We recommend having dinner at the riad (we ended up having dinner there every night!) as Rania’s food is just exquisite (we really miss your cooking Rania!). Eric and Didier would ask us every morning what we fancied for dinner (thanks for cooking the fish and pastilla ) ensuring that fresh ingredients were bought daily from the market. The breakfast at the riad was also great - fresh pastries coffee eggs bread juice yoghurt…delicious and plentiful to keep you going until lunchtime.  You can book a hamman and other treatments at the riad – my wife and I booked the hammam and massage and we have never felt so relaxed.    Didier Eric Aziz Rania Abdel and all of the staff at Houdou – thank you for making our stay so magical and we look forward to seeing you again very soon.,Date of stay: November 2017,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShaziaK91

Riad Houdou,Daniel H wrote a review Nov 2017,50,Outstanding and beautiful Riad in the heart of the Marrakech medina.,We stayed at Riad Houdou for 3 nights mid of November and enjoyed it very much.  It's located in the northern part of the medina and we strongly recommend to use their pick up service as it might be hard to find especially during night times.  Arriving at the Riad escaping the busy and noisy hustle and bustle of the Souk you feel the relaxed and quiet atmosphere right away. We were welcomed by one of the owners Eric serving mint tea and Marrocan pastries. After check-in he showed us the complete Riad and explained some details. They renovated the guesthouse with passion and love which you will notice by all the little details and nice decoration. We stayed in the Tarjine room which has a good size for two. Bathroom was a bit narrow but easy to accept considering that the bathrooms had been included after the Riad was built (in former times they only had the Hammam to share as the common bathroom). Bed was really cosy and everything clean. Biscuits and water complimentary. Nights during winter can get cold so it's good to have a mobile heating in the room.  Breakfast is served on the beautiful and sunny terrace with local bread homemade jam yoghurt and fruits. Eggs are served on demand. We also had a 3 course dinner at the Riad which can be booked in advance. The menu is fixed but you should definitely not miss this. Make sure to be hungry as portions are big.  We also recommend the Spa. We tried the Hammam which was really good and also massages which were also a good treatment. We had the partner massage for which the room was a bit tight but always remember that it is an old building.  When booking this Riad remember that it is a traditional building which is naturally clairaudient which isn't a problem as long as all guests (the house has only 6 rooms) behave thoughtfully.  Also bear in mind that you are in a Muslim country so it may get louder a few times a day ;-)  Summarizing our stay we would recommend this place for 100%. Especially their owners Eric and Didier together with their super friendly staff make it very unique and outstanding in terms of service!,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Wurzburg, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/349DanielH349

Riad Houdou,Juliah1907 wrote a review Nov 2017,50,Delightful riad with great food and lovely helpful staff,I gather there are hundreds of riads in Marrakech but I doubt any are better than Riad Houdou. The riad is just as beautiful as the pictures clearly a lot of thought has been put into making a charming place to stay which has lovely food (with special touches like homemade yogurt and jams with breakfast) and is well-situated to visit the Medina. What really makes Riad Houdou special is the staff - everyone is very friendly and wants to make sure you have a great time. They regularly take new guests to the main square early in your visit to make sure you feel orientated which was a great help. We also went on one of the trips that the staff organise and had a great day in the Atlas Mountains with Hassan our friendly and informative driver.,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Gateshead, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Juliah1907

It looked just like the pics but even more cuter. Very cute eclectic and whimsical charm with pops of color. I wish my house looked like this; especially since their design esthetics match mine... mix of modern/retro and ethnic (Moroccan and Indian etc with lots of color). The owners Didier and Eric and their right-hand men Abdel and Aziz were very nice and hospitable. When we got there Didier and Eric chatted with us with tea and sweets getting to know us and sharing info as well as giving us the history of the place and them coming to Morocco. Didier also walked us to the main square that evening (9pm-ish) to show us the way and give us markers so we wouldn't get lost in the Medina. They were very hospitable and nice. We stayed for 3 nights in the Fes Room our home away from home and were very comfortable.

Riad Houdou,acsidari wrote a review Oct 2017,50,Truly an oasis!! + Exceptional food and staff!,Riad Houdou is truly an oasis! We are an American couple and are currently living in Italy - so we travel quite a bit. This was hands down the BEST place we have every stayed. From the moment we arrived at Riad Houdou we were treated with kindness warmth and top-notch hospitality.    When we arrived at the airport in Marrakech a transfer was waiting for us with a sign that was very easy to spot. We were dropped off and had a 5-10 minute walk to reach the Riad - but a porter was sent with a cart to carry our bags easily through the crazy Medina streets. (I highly recommend booking transfers through the Riad - it was easy cheap and otherwise our journey might not have been so seamless.) This was our first time in Marrakech so even the very short walk to the Riad was a bit overwhelming especially with the busy afternoon pedestrian traffic. It was such a pleasure to be welcomed kindly by Didier (one of the owners) who offered us homemade Moroccan treats and delicious mint tea - poured beautifully by Aziz (part of the Riad's exceptional team). Didier sat with us for quite some time to tell us about the Riad and gave us countless important tips for navigating Marrakech. What made our time in Marrakech even better was Didier walking us to the square shortly after our arrival - pointing out key directional points along the way. The streets in the Medina are a big maze so we really appreciated Didier's tour!    We stayed at Riad Houdou for one week - and the dinners were so delicious that we ate at the Riad every single night. The staff made a point to serve us a unique dinner every night of our stay and we tried every Moroccan speciality imaginable - from tajine to tangia chermoula to couscous and harira to special desserts. Bravo to Rania and the other cooks (chefs really!) at Riad Houdou. The breakfasts were equally delicious featuring a different traditional pancake/bread/cake each morning. Thanks to Riad Houdou this was one of our favorite 'food trips' we have ever taken.    And a very special thank you to Didier and Eric (the owners) Rania (the kitchen mastermind) Aziz (the most friendly helpful and FUN team member) and Abdel (the expert manager who greeted us with a smile and thoughtful guidance almost every day of our trip). We will see you again one day soon inch'Allah. :)    For the food the hospitality and the incredibly welcoming staff we cannot recommend Riad Houdou enough!!!

The car stops at a certain point about 5 min away from the hotel and someone will help you with your luggage and take you to the hotel this was all arranged by the hotel. The staff communicated with us ahead of time to ensure the arrangements were made.  Everyone was very nice. The room was tastefully decorated had air-conditioner both a shower and a tub. Breakfast was delicious and generous. Abdel and Aziz were great as well as the ladies preparing the breakfast. We got great recommendations for where to go for dinner outside as we chose to eat out.

It was a gentle entree to Morocco. My friend with whom I travelled always stays here when in Marrakech and she travels a lot. The breakfast on the terrace the first morning with the tastes of cumin orange blossom and cinnamon whilst overlooking the rooftops of Marrakech was an experience I don't think I will ever forget. The people who work there are all lovely. Didier walked us to the main piazza the first morning and a staff member walked us to a restaurant that Didier recommended one night after dark which was obviously very helpful.

The place is decorated beautifully and it is amazing how it is quiet. The rooms and clean and the wifi/ac work great. Our room had its own terrace! Just laying outside on the couch and relaxing! My suggestion would be to have a taxi take you right to the street - then you just have to walk down 2 minutes to the end of the little alley/street to the Riad. This was my favorite place throughout the 12 day journey. Also they had their own hammam for those of us who prefer to try the custom in a little more privacy. You feel so clean afterwards!!!

Riad Houdou,David_Jess wrote a review Jun 2017,50,Do do Houdou!,Riad Houdou is separated from other riads and hotels by the quality of the service. From the moment we arrived we were treated as guests in someone’s home – given advice on travelling around this crazy city and made to feel so very welcome in the riad.    The riad itself is tastefully decorated and so peaceful. The trees in the courtyard open to the air and the plunge pool give a relaxing space to cool off.    TOP TIP: Book dinner here. There are lots of great restaurants in this city but also many tourist traps. For at least one night guarantee a delicious meal with good service at Riad Houdou. We stayed for three nights and the home cooked authentic Moroccan food we had on our first night was better than the restaurants we had lunches and dinners in (and significantly better than the hotel we moved onto). I think the food is so good because they shop locally and prepare specifically for that day – rather than restaurants trying to get as many people through as possible. Our fantastic first night tagine was cooked for three hours; no restaurant can cater this specifically.    The best part of Riad Houdou is Eric and his team – they are so lovely and welcoming. We were taken to the square on day one to get our bearings and given advice on places to visit on their personalized map. They also organized a trek into the mountains for us which was fantastic. All their suppliers chef drivers guides etc. have been tested and approved by them so you can trust you’ll get the same welcoming smiles and attentive service.    We then went on to another hotel for one night to escape the city and relax by the pool which was fantastic but it was Riad Houdou who provided the memories of a fantastic holiday.,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/David_Jess
Riad Houdou,CR_from_Melbourne wrote a review Jun 2017,50,A beautiful oasis of peace and calm,My mother my sister and I loved our stay at Riad Houdou. We were welcomed by Eric and his staff and made to feel very welcome with mint tea served on our arrival in the beautiful courtyard at the centre of the riad. Even in punishing Moroccan heat the riad stayed cool and provided a wonderful calm oasis to come back to after the hustle and bustle of the souks. The staff were friendly and incredibly helpful. We were shown our way around the medina and given tips about how to get around Marrakesh. To say that the staff are accommodating is an understatement: they provided us with a French breakfast on our final morning at 3am so that we could make our very early flight! The meals we had in the riad were delicious.

We stayed in the babouches room and loved the attached private terrace the room was spotless and is very well equipped the air conditioning always a welcomed asset when returning from the bustling hot streets of the medina.  The staff were amazing  very friendly and extremely accommodating.  We ate at the Riad three times and the food was incredible  unrivalled by any food we had in other restaurants.  The Riad is a perfect location for those wanting to explore Marrakech and has a very calm peaceful ambience.

The owners Didier and Eric along with the staff made us feel very welcomed.    The first day we arrived they walked us to the main square and showed us how to get back to the Riad. Very helpful.    We had dinner at the riad on the first night and the 3 course meal was excellent. Service was also top notch!    Breakfast on the rooftop terrace was amazing. Homemade jams and pastries yogurt breads eggs etc... probably best breakfast spread we had thought our trip to Morocco.    We arranged an airport shuttle with the riad which was also seamless and priced well.    Overall experience was very warm personalized and helpful without being obtrusive.

Riad Houdou,shellbyuk wrote a review Jun 2017,50,Amazing place. Amazing hosts. Amazing city 😊,This is a gorgeous little place in the centre of an amazing city. Despite the hustle and bustle of the city around it this is a quiet quaint little place. A short walk to the main square. On arrival we were treated to a lovely tea and local sweets while Eric made us feel at home and shared with us his knowledge of the city and how to survive it's busy streets! He gave us some great little tips and then walked with us to the main square. This is just one touch that helps you to feel truly comfortable in this crazy place!  We stayed in the room downstairs by the plunge pool which was delightful and great for a little dip after exploring this wonderful city.  One tip it does help to have cash to pay however due to problems at the cash point they were happy to receive a bank transfer.,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,wirral uk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shellbyuk
Riad Houdou,jennifer934 wrote a review Jun 2017,50,Riad Houdou lived up to all our expectations.,Fabulous Riad in a Central position in the old Medina. Such a tranquil atmosphere with wonderful scents and flowers it was unbelievable how relaxed we were after just a few days. Didier and Eric are wonderful hosts as are their friendly but professional staff. Worth having them arrange the transfer to and from the airport as it would be challenging on a first visit to find the Riad independently. From arriving slightly nervous to venture out on our own with their guidance on our first morning we soon grew in confidence and enjoyed strolling around the souks and chatting to the friendly local people. Had a couple of evening meals in the Riad both of which were delicious.,Date of stay: February 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Godstone,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennifer934

Riad Houdou,cstride wrote a review Jun 2017,50,Perfect!,We fell on our feet when we chose Riad Houdou for our Marrakech stay. Just 10 minutes walk from the Place Djema el Fnaa gives it the perfect location for exploring in bursts.  The owners Didier and Eric have created the perfect blend of welcoming informative hosts without being pushy. We were welcomed with tea and cakesand Didier gave us loads of info about what to see and do and well as a reconnaissance trip so that we could navigate our way through the Medina.  The Riad itself is an oasis of calm in the hustle and bustle. We appreciated the shade of the patio and the cool water of the plunge pool! This place is beautifully decorated - and each room has its own delightful style.  Breakfasts on the terrace were the perfect way to start the day. I'd also recommend dining at the Riad. We ate there three times and the food was delicious. Didier and Eric will try to accommodate all tastes each evening - our son was particularly pleased with his chicken kebab and chips whilst we were delighted with our fish tagine.  The team at the Riad are all so friendly we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.

Welcome drinks and cookies lovely aperitif in group great service and an food. The cook/staff are amazing warm. friendly and helpful. The first day someone takes you to the main square so that you get your bearings they also spend time with you on the map for the same reason. We stayed in the Babouche room with private terrace and loved it but we are early risers so the breakfast on the terrace noise would not have affected us. The riad itself is lovely authentic full of nooks and crannies including a small pool. Found the location not to far from anything; takes about 10 min walk to the main square but there is so much to see in between.    The parking is always a bit of a gamble outside the medina we paid 40 dirhams a night its not really guarded if you think of a US equivalent but its basically a parking space in a make shift lot with someone ""guarding"" it. Mind you it was there in the morning.. We also found it a little difficult to get to but after getting our bearings it was pretty straight forward.

Riad Houdou,gschloesser1 wrote a review May 2017,50,An oasis with attention to every detail,We absolutely enjoyed everything about Riad Houdou starting with our initial contact.  Eric and Didier the co-owners and both French natives were both very attentive and responsive to our email questions and inquiries. They even arranged for a driver to meet us at the airport and adapted when our flights were delayed a full day.    None of this changed when we arrived at the Riad. Didier met us and immediately brought us mint tea and pastries. Yum! He sat and talked with us for quite some time then had one of his associates give us a complete tour. The Riad is lovely with beautiful rooms and resting spaces tucked away in every corner. Everything is decorated wonderfully with attention given to every detail. The expansive rooftop terrace is very comfortable and offers a wonderful view of the distant snow-capped High Atlas Mountains. Two pet turtles wander the courtyard and an elusive chameleon hides in the trees.    We ate dinner at the Riad on our first night and it was wonderfully presented and prepared. The server was attentive and excellent. Breakfast each morning consisted of bread pastries jams eggs juices tea and/or coffee all delicious. We ate both mornings on the terrace enjoying the views and breeze.    My wife enjoyed a spa treatment one morning which she really enjoyed. The Riad has its own hammam which is immaculately clean.    At departure Eric arranged for a taxi to take us back to the airport so we could secure our rental car. A day later we received an email from them making sure we were OK and had enjoyed our experience at Riad Houdou. We certainly did!    A note that the Riad is located down a side lane from a busy street. From the outside it appears to be nothing special. Don't let that fool you though as inside is a true oasis from the busy chaotic atmosphere of Marrakech's medina. Also the Riad is amazingly quiet and one does not hear much of the noise of the medina.

Everything is as promised - the service is friendly and genuine the Riad itself is elegantly furnished - it truly is an oasis of tranquility that is much needed after a day out adventuring the Medina.  The breakfast is delicious- many hand made things  all so fresh. We had one dinner in at the Riad and it was a delicious Tagine again fresh and authentic.  We also indulged in a house Hamman with massage and this was devine and was a great way to unwind after a hot dusty day.  Overall we couldn't fault Riad Houdou it was perfect for a romantic break and we hope to return.

Riad Houdou,ajzzstreak wrote a review May 2017,50,Best hotel in Marrakech,First time visiting Morocco was really exciting for me and my two other friends. Ever since I booked the hotel  Eric and didier kept in touch with me to know the status of my flight and transportation because there was a long layover at Casablanca . However didier and Eric made a taxi arrangement for me from the airport . First person I met from the hotel was idris who was really humble and nice . Upon arrival at the hotel he served us Moroccan specialty the mint tea . Day second we had breakfast which was more than amazing . The chef makes food once you seat down so you expect freshness . Food consists of house made jams  fantastic yogurt  fresh squeezed orange juice pancakes and eggs if you like. I met my best friend of the trip abdel (the manager ) . Who told us a lot about marakkech history and places to visit . He even showed us around and dropped us at the local shops . Whenever I needed something abdel was there with a smile . Eric also helped with whatever we needed . Didier made sure we are comfortable at the hotel. Aziz who also works at the hotel  who doesn't speak much English but he's sign language and little English here and there will do the job. Aziz also a very good human being . The dinner at the hotel is amazing. Made with local produce and served with air of simplicity. On the last day our flight was at 8 Pm but our check out was at 12 pm . Abdul Eric and didier let us stay until our flight without any charge . The hotel is seriously beautiful nice view of the old Marrakech  good food  good human beings . The hotels people actually make you feel like you never left home . This is just your second home .

Riad Houdou,Lozzer2014 wrote a review Apr 2017,50,A gem of a Riad,From the time we booked to the time we left we were made to feel at home. It was great to get collected from the airport from a taxi and then a cart to the hotel as we wouldn't have found the Riad. Welcomed when we arrived with tea. It was good the first morning after arriving to be shown the way back to the Riad so we knew where to come back to on our own. We had a couple of traditional meals which was lovely. Breakfast on the roof terrace was very good with homemade and local produce. The rooms are decorated to a high standard and we ended up booking an extra two nights stay. We managed to spot the chameleon a couple of times and we kept an eye out for the tortoises. Would recommend this Riad to anyone going to Marrakesh.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lozzer2014
Riad Houdou,Heoldon wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Seriously good; book elsewhere at your own risk!,I haven't stayed elsewhere in Marrakesh but I doubt you will find similar accommodation that overall is anywhere near as good as this one. This is primarily because the owners (Eric and Didier) and their staff treat you as a guest in their house. It's centrally located just a short walk from the main square but more importantly the riad is a beautiful haven of comfort piece and quiet. Nothing is too much trouble for them and they look after you so well as their guests. Special mention needs to be made of the traditional Moroccan meals (inclusive breakfasts and optional dinners). Every day of our weeks stay each meal was different and exceptional. We only ate dinner elsewhere once (at a renowned restaurant nearby) and the food wasn't as good and the service terrible. Dinners at the riad sometimes included all residents plus Eric and Didier on one long table which was a great way to meet everyone and trade recommendations for places to visit. The riad's central open courtyard (with its fountains orange trees and resident tortoises and chameleon) was a lovely spot for pre-dinner drinks. The air-conditioned rooms (each individually themed and furnished) were very pleasant one of ours had a private roof terrace. I'd definitely recommend taking up the pre-arranged airport transfer to make life easier on arrival. One unexpected bonus was Didier is a runner too and took me on a great 10K run early one morning. In summary I was hugely impressed by Riad Houdou and strongly recommend staying there.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Exeter, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Heoldon

The courtyard area was peaceful and it was the ideal place to relax amongst the orange trees after a day out exploring the Medina. The food was superb and we ate an amazing range of Moroccan dishes including delicious vegetarian tajines. Our rooms had everything we needed and the private balcony was a great place to enjoy the sun. I would recommend the Hammam and massage for total relaxation!

Riad Houdou,Putnik78 wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Best Riad in Marrakesh,We stayed here for 5 nights with our 2 children aged 11 and 8. The hosts (Eric and Didier) were very kind and helpful. Before we travelled we felt nervous about the number of Riads and we were not sure if we had booked the right one. But as soon we we arrived to the airport everything ran smoothly. We were picked up by the hotel's driver walked into the Road and felt right at home. Btw we would definitely recommend booking the taxi through the hotel.    Although Eric and Didier were amazing it was everyone else working in the Riad that makes the stay so perfect. Aziz Abdel and all others never behave like this is a job for them. They simply treat you like family and were fantastic with our kids.    The room we had was decorated in traditional style making us feel we really stepped back in history. Whether it was breakfast or dinner we felt treated like kings with the variety taste and choice - they kept changing the menu every day which is difficult as many of the dinner dishes take 3-4 hours to cook.    Erik and Didier never get tired of answering questions about the city places to see and where to eat. For 3 nights they ate with us and other guests telling stories and listening to ours. We felt like a family by the end of the trip.

Riad Houdou,alchernow wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Beautiful and Hospitable Riad,Having just returned to New York from Morocco I'm still floating on the memories from an amazing trip. One of the highlights was Riad Houdou in Marrakech where the hosts Didier and Eric and staff (especially Abdel and Aziz) were incredibly warm welcoming and helpful. Not being on a tour and organizing the trip on our own my husband and I welcomed all their helpful information and assistance including their arranging a taxi to meet us at the Casablanca airport and take us to the Marrakech Riad guiding us with a map to the main square on our first day and arranging a driver (who then organized hotels and stops) for our subsequent four-day trip to the desert and up to Fez. Didier especially was on top of customer service making us feel as though we were welcomed guests in his home. Our room was lovely---it included a terrace and had special touches like fluffy towels potpourri in the bathroom and typically beautiful Moroccan design detail. The only small downside was that our room was located just off the main roof terrace where breakfast was served every morning so it felt as though we were waking up in the middle of a public space but we got used to that and it was minor. The Riad as a quiet oasis in the center of bustling vibrant and relentless Marrakech....the courtyard was leafy and gorgeous and hid two turtles a chameleon and a cat. Two of our four nights we ate dinner at the Riad and the food/service were excellent but it was really the breakfasts that were fantastic: homemade jams breads eggs fruit yogurt....the meal (included in the hotel cost) was really a feast. I would highly recommend this Riad not only for its character beauty and reasonable price but especially for its warm hospitality and excellent customer service.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Katonah, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alchernow
Riad Houdou,Joy M wrote a review Apr 2017,50,"Lovely, quiet Riad with great food",Riad Houdou was a welcome oasis from the noise and bustle -- and heat -- of Marrakech. This small French-owned hotel offers great hospitality from the moment we walked in.    Actually the hospitality began before we arrived with excellent advice on how best to negotiate the confusing medina. The Riad is only 2 minutes walk from where a taxi will drop you and it's trivial (and cheap) to hire a guy to schlep your bags to the door. No stairs along the way so if you can walk two flat blocks you're golden.    Our hosts provided an excellent map and advice on what are the best things to see (and when). They escort each guest to the main square pointing out landmarks along the way so you will be able to return home at the end of the day.    They offer dinner which I highly recommend. You might think eating in your hotel is a cop out but tagines take hours to cook so home cooking is a cut above any restaurant.    Breakfast is included of course and it too is among the best we had in Morocco. Especially the homemade yogurt.

The hosts Eric and Didier made us feel incredibly welcome from the moment we rang the doorbell of Riad Houdou. After sharing very helpful tips and pointing out points of interest Eric walked us to Jamaa el Fna (the main square) and carefully pointed out landmarks to help guide us through the labyrinth that is the Medina. We never got lost after his thoughtful guidance! The staff at the riad could not have made us feel greater warmth from the first hello to our last sip of mint tea. We were completely pampered with impeccable service and delectable meals. From the courtyard to the rooftop terrace not a detail was overlooked and we delighted in pure bliss at Riad Houdou.

Riad Houdou,adsjjg wrote a review Feb 2017,50,Beautiful oasis of calm in the centre of the madness that is Marrakech!,I am so glad we chose to stay here. The Riad is beautiful and full of character having been restored very sympathetically by Eric and Didier. We stayed in the Epices room which was large and had plenty of room for my husband and I and our two teenage daughters. Our friends stayed in the Babouche room which was also gorgeous with their own balcony. The breakfasts were amazing and we had 2 lovely dinners with some very nice Moroccan wine. What really makes this place special though is Eric and Didier and all their lovely staff especially Aziz and the lovely lady who made us breakfast. They all worked so hard to make sure we were having a good time. Aziz was constantly on the go and never stopped smiling. We were given a guided tour of the Medina on the first day so we could find our way back helped with restaurant recommendations and information whenever we needed it. This was really one of the nicest places we have stayed in and we would definitely go back if we had the chance.,Date of stay: February 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,Beverley East Yorkshire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adsjjg
Riad Houdou,angie_camp wrote a review Feb 2017,50,Beautiful riad in the middle of the medina,Prior to our arrival communication was excellent. We were provided with detailed information about how to reach the riad and the services offered (excursions spa etc.) Didier and Eric were amazing hosts and took the time to welcome us and show us around the riad after we arrived. We were greeted at the riad with mint tea and some delicious snacks and Didier walked with us to the main square to show us the way without getting lost. The riad itself is down a quiet road off a busy area of the medina. Inside it is very peaceful and beautifully decorated. Breakfast was on the terrace in the morning with a great view over the city. We really enjoyed the homemade yogurt fresh bread and eggs. The staff here is excellent and always friendly and accommodating. On our last day we had to leave very early in the morning to the airport Eric and Didier helped us to arrange a transfer and their staff made sure we had our breakfast ready extra early. Thank you for an amazing stay would highly recommend this place in Marrakech!

Riad Houdou,Josje H wrote a review Feb 2017,50,Amazing sanctuary,My mom and I visited Marrakesh and stayed in Eric and Didier's riad for almost a week. We had the most amazing time! We were received with such enthusiasm: a complementary pot of mint tea and some pastries a brief tour of the place and a lot of anekdotes and stories about the place. The passion for hospitaility whilst remaining a traditional guesthouse was truly visible. The staff is very kind always available but never pushy. We ended up eating in the riad almost every night: truly terrific food relaxed atmosphere and good morrocan wines. We arranged for a trip to the Atlas mountain via the riad all was extremely well organized and great fun. Also: make sure you book the hamam in the riad! My skin has never been so soft.  All in all I would highly recommend Riad Houdou to everyone visiting Marrakesh. Eric and Didier walk with you to djema el fna and point out how to walk back (10 min walk through lovely small streets) so you don't get lost. They know a lot of great spots and have tips on embarking the adventure that is the Souks. When you get back to the quiet of the riad coming out of amazing though chaotic marrakech it feels like nothing less than a sanctuary. I'm definitely coming back!,Date of stay: February 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Nijmegen, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josjeh

Riad Houdou,andrewoversands wrote a review Jan 2017,50,What a gem.,We picked Riad Houdou because the website photos attracted us to it separately. We were so glad to have made this choice. Didier and Eric were perfect hosts and gave us both the privacy and company just when needed . Didier gave us a great personal welcome and rundown of how to navigate the medina and how to interact with the local community which gave us the confidence to move around with ease.  The included breakfasts were wonderful but the evening meals were stunning and were made real intimate occasions. The staff were all lovely people and we felt genuinely welcomed.  We can also recommend the two local restaurants Le Fondouk and Dar Tazi 100% where you will find world class cuisine and presentation adjacent to a bustling medina alley.  Didier and Eric arranged for a walking day in the Atlas mountains and again this was really memorable.

Riad Houdou,AlexoRoma wrote a review Dec 2016,50,Welcoming riad at Medina heart,We arrived on an evening and were greeted by Eric who offered us mint tea with Moroccan pastries and gave us a good introduction to Marrakech with explanations on what to do and where to go. The riad has a nice courtyard with an orange tree and a small water fountain - very relaxing if you want to spend some time away from the Medina noise and stress. The room is small but with enough space to accommodate the bed small table with two chairs and a closet. Many small details in the room and the bathroom make the stay much more pleasant than in an average chain hotel: pictures in the walls dried herbs etc. Breakfast was on the terrace: fruit yoghurt delicious bread and eggs made an excellent start of the day.

The food is delicious and the atmosphere so good it makes it difficult to want to sample meals elsewhere!

I would say a majority of the riad owners may visit once a month but with them they are there to welcome you have a dinner with you and help you with any questions about your visit to the city. Beautiful rooms well decorated great concierge services friendly staff and amazing meals for breakfast and dinner offered.

Didier Eric and all other staff could not be more welcoming or accommodating they could not do more for us than they did. Food was INCREDIBLE both breakfast and dinner best food we had in Marrakech chicken tagine was amazing as was the carrot and strawberry dessert. Breakfast was always lovely especially on the roof terrace on a sunny day. Was incredibly clean and lovely to get away from the hustle and bustle of the main souk area which was only a short walk but the riad was so calm and beautiful. Was given a tour on our arrival day to show us how to get too and from the main square and advice on what to see which was great as had not been to Marrakech before.

Riad Houdou,Kate F wrote a review Nov 2016,50,A little piece of heaven...,I would never usually think of returning to somewhere I had already visited but I honestly can't imagine coming to Marrakech and wanting to stay anywhere else but the Riad Houdou! I stayed here in April with my husband and a couple of friends and returned just recently for a girls' trip with my sister. We were originally attracted by the amazing reviews and I'm happy to report they are accurate.  It's worth saying that if you want a generic western hotel or lots of children's holiday activities go to one of the chains in the new part of town. If you would prefer an authentic Moroccan experience with a chic French twist (thanks to the owners/hosts Didier and Eric who are quite simply DIVINE!) come here. All the staff are wonderful without exception but Didier and Eric make you feel like you are visiting friends. Nothing is too much trouble and although we ate out on several occasions the food at the Riad was the best by far we had in Marrakech.  The attention to detail is what makes this so special. The Riad is in the heart of the medina which assaults the senses with its colour and noise but even though it is set only 50m off a main thoroughfare it is an oasis of peaceful tranquility.  I have read a couple of rather pedantic less good reviews about the Houdou. Please if you are that kind of person go and stay somewhere else! One final tip: book direct with the Riad.,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Martock, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katef943

Riad Houdou,joannegray wrote a review Nov 2016,50,I cannot rate highly enough,The Riad is in (debatable y fantastic location) its in the heart of the medina just before the souks but down a derb (which is a dead end street) so there isn't much noise. However the souks are quite dirty and can be dangerous if you are women/a woman travelling alone and the streets are hectic and quite dirty and no cars can get very close to the Riad so you must walk on the other hand its great for an authentic experience and being thrown into the different culture.  This is the only bad (but even then not really anything to do with the Riad) aspect.  The service is friendliness is beyond above and beyond. My mother has actually cried because she misses Aziz and we were only here for one week! The food is better than in any restaurant we ate in here (and I'm a huge foodie!) the home cooked meals starter main dessert drinks tables laid out all fantastically waitered amazingly I truly cannot recommend staying in to eat enough. This is something I would never do being of the opinion you go abroad to experience as much as possible outside of just the place you are staying in but it truly is phenomenal. Those were my favourite times of our holiday. I particularly enjoyed the mint tea which was noted and I even got to learn how to make it in the kitchen.  The rooms are kept immaculately clean cleaned and reset everyday and the bath is wonderful! Very comfortable and particularly large.

The Riad is beautiful with lots of traditional features it is spotless and well kept. The attention to detail is second to none.    Eric Didier and Aziz are the perfect hosts they really make the visit. As previous reviews note we received our first taste of mint tea and pastries on arrival followed by a tour of the Riad. In the morning we were shown into town which is a really nice touch.    We ate a couple of evening meals at the Riad you will find the cooking hard to beat in Marrakesh it is fantastic!

Riad Houdou,chicks75 wrote a review Nov 2016,50,"An oasis of calm and tranquility, a stone's throw from the centre of this crazy city",We stayed as a group of 6 in the Suite aux Epices and La chambre au thé à la menthe (the teapot room) at the beginning of November. Both were exquisitely decorated and furnished with everything we needed including luxury toiletries towels and hairdryer. The rest of the Riad is no different - traditional to the core but with modern touches and artistic flair throughout. Didier and Eric are the consummate hosts welcoming guests into their home and providing help and assistance over and above what you would expect in an ordinary hotel. This included an orientation talk on our first morning to provide tips on navigating the city the local culture and recommendations on places to visit and even an escorted first walk to the main square (approx 25 min slow stroll). Breakfast on the terrace on a sunny morning with views of the Atlas mountains and rooftops of the medina is truly special. The menu is based on local dishes with variety each day. We had 2 delicious evening meals cooked by Rajaa and served by Aziz which we thought were higher than restaurant standard and great value at EUR 19 for 3 courses and tea/coffee. The wine and drinks selection was also good in terms of quality and price (e.g. EUR 4.5 for a glass of wine). We also availed of the spa facilities in the Riad. The hammam and massage may have been slightly more expensive than you can get elsewhere but the luxury of having your robe and slippers delivered to your room beforehand and being able to relax in the peaceful surroundings afterwards is worth the little extra. Taxi transfers to and from the airport were arranged effortlessly and porters are on hand to meet guests and escort them and their luggage the last few minutes on foot through the bustling market. I really cannot fault anything about our stay here and would highly recommend to others looking for relaxing stay at a traditional guesthouse located within the heart of the old city.,Date of stay: November 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chicks75

From the moment we were collected at the airport we felt safe and looked after. Getting to the Riad through the busy streets of the medina is an assault on the senses but the moment you step through the door of the Riad you enter a slice of paradise. Beautiful lights tinkling water and stunning decorative touches everywhere combine with high quality attentive service making this place hard to beat. In the morning Didier sat down with us and gave us lots of useful advice about finding our way around what to visit and how to minimise hassle in the medina. He then personally showed us the route to the square. (Incidentally if you are thinking of visiting Marrakesh with family take heart in the fact that we experienced relatively little hassle perhaps because the Moroccans respect the family? ) We ate at the Riad and were delighted that Didier and Eric and two guests joined us for dinner making a lovely occasion (they did check first if we want this or a private table!)

Riad Houdou,Jri0005 wrote a review Oct 2016,50,Amazing Riad and Caring Staff,"I would strongly recommend this Riad to anyone who is interested in staying within Medina and in very close proximity to the main sites in this area.    The Medina is considered the old city and we felt like we were in the heart of it with many souks nearby if not right outside the Riad. I really liked that the Riad was down a derb from the main road (""derb"" is like a small alley-sized street) because the main road can be very hectic and busy so it means that while we are still very close those several feet down from the Main Street allows it to become very calm and quiet by the time you get into the Riad.    About the Riad: the Riad is absolutely beautiful. It was a very unique experience from staying in a hotel or an AirBnB. It felt a bit more of an authentic experience I imagine compared with if you chose to stay at a formal hotel. The Riad was very clean and it is obvious that the owner Didier cares very much about his Riad and its guests. There are so many decorative details that fit the theme of the Riad and the scents are welcoming.    The staff: they are world-class and provided the absolute best service in every respect. They are extremely accommodating courteous and respectful. I strongly believe that the staff are the reason behind making the experience at Riad Houdou what it is. The first day I arrived I did not want to leave to go sightseeing because it felt so luxurious and I just wanted to be in the Riad and enjoy the space. Didier was very involved in the work of the Riad and always checked in with us ensuring we had everything we need. Aziz was also fantastic with this as well acting like Didier's right hand man.    My boyfriend got sick on the third day (we believe it could have been caused by something he ate at a restaurant unrelated to this Riad) and when we shared this info with the staff they were super accommodating providing us with medicine and extra water and soda (good for resolving stomach issues) and checking in on us. While the whole Riad was still asleep and it was still dark out Aziz woke up extra early to personally prepare us a light breakfast with tea AND assisted us to our transport since my boyfriend was too weak to carry our heavy suitcase as he had previously done throughout our vacation. The entire staff is amazing but Didier and Aziz get extra points for their caring assistance during this rough time for us.    To sum up the Riad: you get the luxury and service you expect from an expensive 5 star hotel while still having people around you who show that they care about their work and your experience. The location was perfect for us because we wanted to stay close to the center of the Medina. If we ever came to Marrakesh again I would definitely come back to this Riad.",Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jri0005

Riad Houdou,Mike H wrote a review Oct 2016,50,A beautiful Riad in Marrakech.,It seems we're not the only ones who enjoyed our stay at Riad Houdou judging by the other guests' comments and rightly so!    Didier and Eric have a beautiful Riad in the Marrakech Medina. You truly feel like you are stepping into another world when you cross the doorway from the hustle and bustle of the medina streets into their peaceful Riad. Clean comfortable friendly everything you'd want.    Didier Eric and all the staff helped to make our stay in Marrakech an amazing one. They're friendly always approachable helpful and knowledgeable. They'll teach you about the best haggling approaches in the souks where the best restaurants are the best day trips to take (which they can also organise for you offering both their own tours and trips as well as assisting you with booking these from other operators) and they'll also walk with you through the meandering medina madness to help you get your bearings and make sure you don't get lost on your way back.    We had dinner in the riad one evening and it was fantastic - candles twinkling in the courtyard with petals strewn in the fountain and on the tables made for a romantic and private setting with only a couple of other guests from the riad present. The food was delicious and the service was the same friendly approach as always.    If you're hesitating about booking your trip to Marrakech we can say you definitely shouldn't. It's a great city and a beautiful country made even better by our stay in Riad Houdou.    Thanks again to Didier Eric and the team.

Riad Houdou,Ojeaku N wrote a review Oct 2016,50,A truely wonderful place to stay,I enjoyed myself immensely at Riad Houdou. It was an absolute oasis in the middle of the medina. The staff were so lovely and helpful always smiling. Their smiles seemed genuine too.

Riad Houdou,Jeffrey C wrote a review Oct 2016,50,Wonderful place to stay in Marrakech,As the other reviewers have mentioned Didier and Eric go out of their way to make their guests feel welcome and comfortable. When you arrive they serve you a nice mint tea and pastries and spend about 30 minutes giving you an orientation to old Marrakech before a tour of the Riad and your room. Then Eric escorts you down to the square so that you can find your way back easily after some time spent exploring and shopping. During the rest of our trip they advised us on various activities we might enjoy and arranged for the ones we chose. The entire staff was outgoing friendly and helpful to a person. We would very much recommend Riad Houdou to anyone traveling to Marrakech.,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffreyC2258

The location of the Riad is great it is inside the medina but in a quiet side street. The orientation delivered on arrival is second to none and everything about the Riad is done with style and care.

Riad Houdou,John_from_Islington wrote a review Sep 2016,50,Great Little Riad,Stayed 3 nights in this charming Riad with my wife and two teenage daughters. Didier & Eric as hosts could not have done anything more to make our stay more enjoyable. They walked with us from the Riad into the centre of the Medina and back to ensure we knew our way round. They had excellent recommendations for local restaurants. We had dinner in the Riad on the first night which was excellent with us being the only ones taking dinner that evening it was like our own very special private dinner party in the Riad's beautiful dining room. Breakfast at Riad Houdou is a simple but delicious affair taken on the roof terrace with tea or coffee fresh juice fruit yogurt filled by local pancakes eggs prepared as you wish and breads served with butter and conserves.    Our only observations were that the taxi company used by the Riad was somewhat expensive and their are much cheaper alternatives and the comment below about the smaller double rooms.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/John_from_Islington

Riad Houdou,CaMaWa wrote a review Aug 2016,50,Wonderful hosts and Riad,This place was a perfect escape from the madness of Marrakech made all the better by our hosts Erik and Didier.  The Riad - Clean and very quiet located down the end of a laneway and much cooler than outside in the souks or medina. Courtyard was comfortable and shaded by orange trees with a fountain and water feature. There is a plunge pool for guests. The roof top terrace was a great spot for breakfast and an evening drink.  Room - Airconditioned and with a fan. Comfortable bed in room safe and sofa type chair. Bathroom was reasonable with good shower. Provided soaps and shampoo were good. Plenty of large sized towels.  The hosts - Erik and Didier went above and beyond to facilitate our comfort. Erik was there to welcome us on our arrival with mint tea and pastries and gave us an escorted tour of the Medina to help us get our bearings the following day. The house staff were wonderful polite and very attentive.  Meals - Had an enjoyable dinner that was cooked in house by the staff traditional fresh tagine followed by dessert. Breakfast was standout with yoghurt eggs breads fresh orange juice.  Transfers - We took advantage of the transfers offered by Erik from the airport on arrival and to the bus station on departure. Pick up was in a clean vehicle with an English speaking driver. We were met at the entrance to the medina by a man with a cart who took the bags to the Riad for us.  All in all was a great stay would return and recommend highly.,Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Perth, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaMaWa
Riad Houdou,raona_zandona wrote a review Aug 2016,50,Exceptional,Riad Houd was the best place I have ever stayed.    The Riad is amazing the localization is excellent and the service is exceptional.    It is best to take the shuttle to the Riad when arriving in Marrakech the medina can be a little confusing for those who do not know but then it is ok.    The breakfast is excellent and the dinner too – I suggest that you try at least one day the dinner.    The staff is exceptional I just have to thank Erick and Didier for all the help tips and attention and Aziz for his kindness and education at all times. There is no better service.

Riad Houdou,samwilliamssss wrote a review Aug 2016,50,Completely amazing in every single way!,After arriving in Marrakech I was initially overwhelmed with the craziness of the city. The medina was like nowhere else I had travelled before and we were stumbling trough the streets wondering if we'd made a mistake booking this impulsive trip to Morocco.  That was until we found our riad... From the second we arrived our hosts made us feel safe welcome and above all else completely at home.  I had made a mistake with my booking and booked us in for the wrong dates yet we were accommodated for anyway. We stayed in a room that was truly a little piece of paradise.  Each morning we enjoyed delicious breakfast on the rooftop terrace and we even had a few scrumptious traditional dinners cooked by the amazing resident chef.  I loved Marrakech almost completely due to the experience I had at Riad Houdou I couldn't more highly recommend it to other travellers!

Riad Houdou,Liz S wrote a review Aug 2016,50,A little oasis,We stayed at Riad Houdou April 2016 and it was the first time we had visited Marrakech. From the moment we were picked up from the airport to our final meal at the riad we knew we were in experienced capable hands.  We had deliberately chosen Riad Houdou on the strength of the positive comments on Trip Advisor and it certainly lived up to expectations.  Even though we had a two hour delay at the airport Eric was there to greet us when we arrived at 11.00pm with mint tea and traditional cakes. This hospitality continued throughout our stay.  Our stay in the riad combined attention to detail with surroundings which promoted relaxation and calm.  On our first day Eric took us out and showed us how to navigate the medina back to the riad which was invaluable.  The breakfast offered a variety of traditional breads homemade conserves and yoghurt followed by a cooked option if you still had room. An evening meal at Riad Houdou is a must. We had three traditional evening meals and each time the meal was exquisite.  The organisation of our day trip to the Atlas Mountains was second to none and definitely something to experience whilst you are there.  Finally Eric Didier Muhammed and team took the time to ensure we could relax and experience Marrakech and all it has to offer at our own pace.  We definitely recommend a stay here.,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizsX3305QR

Riad Houdou,Barbara L wrote a review Jul 2016,50,Id give 6 stars if Tripadvisor allowed...,The first 2 things you'll take away from Riad Houdou is the absolute warmth of the entire team and the incredibly gorgeous food. A first accompanied walk to the city centre is a very simple and gracious initiative in this maze of a town. The food is honestly like the best you'd eat in a home around the Mediterranean - I'd come back for the food alone. And the 'table d'hote' approach is warm and convivial but never overwhelming. The central courtyard is such a refreshing delight you might be tempted not to go out. The rooms are lovingly decorated. Breakfast is served at flexible hours. And its just a 5 min walk from main points of interest in the medina.

Riad Houdou,LGG wrote a review Jun 2016,50,Beautiful riad and excellent staff,Me and my boyfriend recently stayed at the riad for 3 nights and we are so glad we picked Houdou. It was our first visit to Marrakech and it was quite overwhelming please do thorough research before you plan on visiting the area. We reached the riad quite late on a Saturday evening and the streets leading up to the riad were incredibly busy and hectic but we were kindly greeted by Mohamed at the door he was very friendly and welcoming. On the Sunday he took the time to take us to the main square which was very helpful. On the Monday we had an excursion planned we were instructed by the company to wait at a mosque and Mohamed showed us the way and even stayed with us until we were picked up. Overall the riad was wonderful and the staff were amazing. I would recommend Houdou to anybody who is visiting Marrakech. Also on our last day we tried the hammam and 30 minute message we loved it!

Our room was very comfortable and had a full size hammam. All members of staff were helpful and the house was kept immaculately clean. We particularly loved the breakfasts on the wonderful roof terrace with a view of the Atlas mountains. Beautifully served fruit yogurt in small glass pots delicious honey eggs cooked to perfection and even gluten free bread provided at my request.

The riad has a beautiful central courtyard as well as a lovely rooftop terrace. These are very nice places to lounge.    Breakfast was served on the rooftop terrace. It was very good. And dinner served in the courtyard was exceptional (very very delicious).    The riad offers massages and baths with a hammam. I had a very nice massage there.

Riad Houdou,Mike B wrote a review May 2016,50,A little paradise in bustling Marrakech,We arrived in Marrakech after 10pm. A taxi can only go so far in old Marrakech our bags were taken from the taxi by a man and a handcart with us following behind donkeys in front scooters nipping in and out and people all around in a narrow lane with market stall shops squeezed in on both sides cheek by jowl. Welcome to the hubbub of Marrakech!  The riad itself was lovely. Peaceful and quiet and elegant with a lemon tree and orange tree in the court yard. The room we had was tastefully decorated with Fezs!!!  Eric Didier and Aziz were lovely. So calm and smiley. They went out of their way to make us welcome arranging for a late meal for when we arrived and an early breakfast for when we set off for our 4 day tour in the morning. Due to late changes to our plans we had to rearrange the days we stayed and again our hosts were so accommodating.  Eric showed us how to navigate back the way from the main square back to the Riad in person gave us a riad houdou map which was very useful and gave us some very useful tips about avoiding pick pockets and who to ask for directions if you get lost in the souks; where to get money from and anything you needed to know about Moroccan bureaucracy.  We would really recommend the massage you can get at the riad. There are dedicated rooms for the hammam (scrub) and massage. The massueurs visit the riad which means you can relax after the massage in the dressing gown provided avoiding having to go out in the street if you get it elsewhere.  Our pre-arranged taxi did not turn up to collect us to go to the airport. Eric arranged a taxi for us and reassured with Gallic charm that all would be well and not to worry. He was right.  We both really enjoyed our stay there. Eric Didier and Aziz were friendly and good company and so so calm. We would both thoroughly recommend a stay there.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S8954QQmikeb

Riad Houdou,Tori W wrote a review Apr 2016,50,Lovely Oasis in the Medina,There seemed to be a lot of good options when looking for a hotel - Houdou seemed highly rated so I just booked on a whim and could not be happier with my selection. Absolutely lovely riad! The owners Didier and Eric take such good care of their guests it honestly feels like you're visiting family. I cannot stress enough how much of a difference their hospitality made in our trip. Staying in the medina can be very overwhelming and this hotel is tucked away from the hustle and bustle like an oasis. Coming from the US Marrakech will definitely be a culture shock so having such a resourceful staff was invaluable. The entire staff went above and beyond to make sure our time was enjoyable by home cooked meals guiding us around town and booking unique excursions.    We stayed in the family suite which was very large and comfortable for four people. Great location (FYI walking is your only transportation option in the medina). Décor was lovely recently renovated. Strong wifi. The rose petals sprinkled around were a great touch and the room always smelled amazing. The shower was the only drawback for me since I couldn't figure out how to get the pressure up other than that I have nothing but positive things to say about this place. As someone who just went through this search I can say you will absolutely be happy with your stay here!

Since there were four of us we took the largest Riad room. It was as large as we needed clean and comfortable. We usually ate breakfast and dinner in the Riad. I'm not a breakfast guy so other than the orange juice (that's heavenly throughout the area) I'll say it was OK. Dinner different each night was great.

The riad itself is beautiful. You will just need to see it for yourself. Every detail is looked after including fresh roses in everything.    It's quiet despite being in the Medina.    Their cook is a goddess in the kitchen and everyone is very friendly and attentive. Every need is taken care of and they are so very accommodating (even when plans go awry with tours etc). They are also very helpful with navigating the Medina both socially and physically.    They also have two turtles that run around two cats and a chameleon. Can verify the chameleon does exist. One of the owners found it for me right before we left because I was starting to think it was a good-natured joke to have guests looking for the mysterious chameleon.

The location at the end of a quite alley near the Moukef square makes a perfect combination of being central ( about a 10 minute walk to the main Jemaa el Fnaa square ) while also being very peaceful.

Riad Houdou,232Maria232 wrote a review Mar 2016,50,Perfect stay in a wonderful haven in Marrach Medina,"My family (2 adults and 2 kids - of 8 and 11) stayed in March 2016 in the Riad Houdou for three nights on our round-trip of Morocco.  The riad is well located close enough to the main square and other main attractions but just out of the busiest roads which provided a calmer environment. We never got back very late but after sunset a couple of times and never felt unsafe coming back to the Riad.  The Riad itself has a lovely form beautiful common spaces lovely court great terrace with a view of the Atlas mountains (at least on a clear day)... it is very tastefully decorated with a lot of attention to detail. The atmosphere is calm and soothing with a lot of local features (typical Moroccan decorative elements etc.) yet not ""too much"" - you can see this well from the pictures. All common spaces as well as our room were very clean too.  The description of the room was accurate on the website and we were actually rather positively surprised by the size (and decoration) of the room (we stayed in ""Les Epices"" which hosts very comfortably a family of four).  We had two dinners in the Riad and the food was very good - compliments to Rajaa the chef! :-) You need to order the dinner by 11 am on the day as everything is prepared to order with fresh produce from the market. This said on our first evening we arrived just after 6 pm and the hosts and the chef were still prepared to fix something nice for us even at such short notice from ingredients already available in the house. And the dinner was excellent nonetheless!  All the staff of the riad was very professional discreet and kind - and at the same time gave a feeling of a family. Each one of them contributed to the success of our holiday!  And of course the hosts themselves - Eric and Didier who took care of everything for us were always present ready for a chat giving advice and tips etc. One specific feature worth mentioning is that on the first morning Didier spent quite some time with us showing us on the map the location of the Riad as well as the main attractions around explaining to us which sights had been most appreciated by previous guests etc. AND then he walked us to the main square making thus sure we knew how to get there - and back to the Riad. Excellent service I should say  So what else to say? We felt welcome and taken care of all through the stay by the hosts as well as all (small) staff.

Riad Houdou,Emma M wrote a review Mar 2016,50,"A wonderful, friendly and stylish Riad in a great location",We stayed here as a family in March 2016 with our two children. The Riad is beautifully decorated in a very sympathetic Moroccan style with lots of lovely details. Our room was particularly comfortable and relaxing. We enjoyed a delicious dinner at the Riad on the evening of our arrival as well as breakfast on the terrace each day. The Riad organised transport to and from the airport which made our trip very easy. All of the staff were extremely welcoming and helpful - particularly the wonderful Hamid who was really friendly and accommodating. Can't praise Riad Houdou highly enough - we'll definitely return.

Gorgeous decorating friendly and helpful staff delicious food. It could not have been more perfect. We booked the airport transfer - definitely recommend. We did 2 excursions - 1 day Ourika Valley hiking and 3 day desert explorer. We also tried the hammam and scheduled a massage very nice after being on a camel and sleeping in a tent!

Riad Houdou,abid2015 wrote a review Mar 2016,50,Really hit the jackpot with this gem of a place,A wonderful stay of 3 nights in the gorgeous riad in the downstairs Chechia room with my boyfriend. The hospitality of Didier and the staff were perfect. Didier explained the geography of Marrakech and took us to the main square on the first day to get our bearings. He gave us a great map of the city with key locations and places for food.    The room was beautifully decorated with a comfortable bed. It was peaceful and smelled of lavender!    They organised a day trip to the Atlas mountains (Amizmiz) and this was the cheapest excursion compare to other agencies. We were picked up from the riad and went on a 3 hour hike in the morning a lunch break with traditional food a shorter hike in the afternoon.    We also had a traditional hammam bath (with exfoliation) at the riad. This was fantastic. It was great that they let me and my boyfriend have the hammam together which was very kind (not all places allow this in Marrakech).    The food at the riad was sensational. Lovely mint tea for breakfast with fresh juice and a selection of traditional food. We ate dinner at the riad one night and it was easily the best moroccan dinner we had during the whole stay. They cater well to vegetarians.    Overall highly recommended. If you are thinking of booking a quiet friendly homely hassle-free comfortable place to stay in Marrakech this place is perfect.,Date of stay: February 2016,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abid2015
Riad Houdou,ORD To Anywhere wrote a review Mar 2016,50,"Personalized service, homey atmosphere!","I booked with Riad Houdou pretty much by accident. I was originally supposed to be in Dakar Senegal but an unexpected change in plans had me headed to Marrkesh instead. Wanting to stay in a riad in the medina I hopped online and booked with Houdou as it was very reasonably priced and the photos looked good.    I'm really glad I ended up booking here though as it was the perfect location for my five days exploring Marrakesh and the surrounding area!    I took the riad up on their offer to have someone waiting for me at the airport and bring me directly to the the property. I would HIGHLY recommend doing this if you're not a frequent traveler to countries that are a bit less organized than New York or London. Yes you can get to the medina cheaper on your own however I'd bet good money you'll be lost for quite awhile trying to get from the drop off location to the riad. Taxis can only go so far into the medina so you will need to make your way on foot navigating the area on your own. If you've traveled previously in India or Africa you may manage just fine but otherwise - take the hotel taxi as they will drop you off and you'll be met by a hotel staffer who will show you the way.    I arrived around midnight but one of the owners Didier was still up and waiting to welcome me and process my check-in. I was given a pot of hot mint tea and a tray of Moroccan sweets to snack on while I filled out some short forms and chatted with Didier about the riad. I was handed the key to my room and escorted to the door before being given a promise to walk me to Jemma el Fna (the main square) the next day so I can get my bearings in the maze-like medina.    The room was cozy and quaint. I booked in the Babouches room which has a double bed and is decorated with Moroccan shoes (babouches). It comes with a small attached outdoor patio which is the primary reason I booked the room. Riad are mostly enclosed and rooms face and indoor courtyard so to have an outdoor patio area the Babouches room is located on the room next to the breakfast area so it's a very different experience than the other locations. I'm a heavy sleeper so I was never bothered by any noise caused by people dining outside the room's door but for a light sleeper you may want to consider one of the interior rooms.    The furnishings were very much reflective of Morocco. The decor felt local and added a nice atmosphere to the stay while still being comfortable. It was late February during my stay and nights can be a little chill but the room is stocked with additional blankets as well as a space heater if you find yourself a bit cold. The bed was comfortable the bathroom clean and the water hot every time I needed it. The water pressure was not the best but I was four stories up in an centuries old building so it was understandable and didn't detract from my stay.    Breakfast was included in my rate and Raja the chef did an amazing job of making sure I was well feed every morning. I was presented with a different Moroccan/French pastry every morning with a variety of condiments. Honey features pretty prominently in Morocco and it was always an option at breakfast. Another excellent offering - the roasted crushed almonds mixed with local argan oil which forms a condiment called amlou. Phenomenal! The daily unique pastry was given in addition to a pot of yogurt your choice of tea or coffee a large basket filled with baked bread as well as a choice of eggs. Very filling excellent taste.    The riad has a spa and a hammam both of which I used. The hamman is best described as a small room filled with marble steam and hot water. You can enjoy the room alone or pay extra to have a traditional scrub down where your hair and body are washed and your entire skin exfoliated. Very interesting experience. Not relaxing in the least more of an envigorating event. The spa is a quite room next door to the hamman where massage services are offered. Dark quiet and peaceful.    The wonderful cook Raja is also happy to make dinner for you if you provide notice early in the day. It's customized to your taste so you can talk to her about what you like and what you do not like and she will make sure to prepare a meal that meets your desires. I asked the riad to prepare me dinner one evening during my stay which they were happy to do and even brought up to my room to allow me to eat out on my private patio. The quality of the food was excellent. Raja's tagine was my second favorite thing I ate during my entire trip to Morocco. The accompanying side dishes were all excellently flavored and presented beautifully. An excellent option.    The riad offers to arrange private drivers for an excursion which is a nice option if you get a bit tired of the hectic chaos of Marrakesh's medina. Keep in mind that you are hiring a private driver which means it is likely more expensive than excursions offered by vendors in the medina and also by vendors on the web like Viator. Those excursions are often lower priced since you will be sharing a van/bus with other individuals. On the other hand the private driver is just that - a driver so do not expect in-depth discussion about every thing you pass on the road or every stop you make on the trip. They provide commentary but are primarily drivers. Think about whether you value flexibility and privacy more than information on the locations when booking.    The riad's location is very good. It's in the medina but not exactly in the heart of all the chaos. It's a good 10/15 minute walk from the main square so the area around the riad is not quite as frenetic as others a bit deeper in the medina. The one downside to this is that getting from many of the sights restaurants and shops in the area back to the riad can be confusing as you have further to go. Still if you have even a decent sense of direction the guided walk to the square on your first day provided by Didier or Eric should be sufficient to make sure you don't get lost in the future. On the plus side the Ben Youseff madrasa is a short 5 minute walk from the riad and is one of the major sites in Marrakesh.    Above all else the people at Riad Houdou are the best thing about the property. The owners Didier and Eric are very hospitable. They pop in and out of visibility during your stay always offering a friendly ""Bonjour"" and asking about your experience in the city. They provide good information about the area and are committed to making sure you enjoy yourself. Aziz seems to function as a manager and is constantly seen in the riad taking care of business. Raja's food is excellent and she's in the riad seemingly all the time preparing meals throughout the day. Fatima helps througout the riad at the front desk spa and with serving meals in the morning. Everyone is friendly and welcoming. While Didier and Eric speaking English well most of the other staff are much more comfortable in French so definitely brush up on your French vocabulary a bit before coming.    I enjoyed my stay at Riad Houdou much more than I imagined. If I find myself back in Marrakesh I wouldn't hesitate for a moment to book with them again.

Riad Houdou,Shruti B wrote a review Feb 2016,50,Wonderful stay with family,We chose the riad based on all the great reviews and we were not disappointed.It is a lovely place with friendly staff. We visited with our 7 year old and she had a field time with the cat and turtles. She enjoyed herself in the library on the computer and in the pool when not riding on a horse carriage or posing with monkeys in the Main square.    Didier was very helpful and accompanied us to the Main square on the first evening which was about 10 mins away. This was also very convinient as we could come back for some rest during the day.    Breakfast was lovely with different Moroccan dishes on each of the 3 days served in a beautiful roof terrace setting.    We took a day trip to Imlil which was arranged by Eric. I would highly recommend this trip as it is apparently offered only by a couple of riads.

Riad Houdou,Faiza B wrote a review Feb 2016,50,"Best Riad in Marrakesh, just Amazing!!!",Sorry for the late review!    A friend and I went to Marrakesh over the Christmas period.    Well to start with our flight was delayed and we got there a few hours later than planned and we had already pre booked a taxi through the Riad. We were of course worried that maybe no one would be there but the driver was still at the airport waiting for us! When we got to the Riad we were met by Eric and Didier who provided us with some lovely mint tea and cakes. We were given such a warm heartfelt welcome it was wonderful. They also had a hot meal waiting for us at the Riad! Yum!    We stayed in the Fez room. I can't fault anything about our room or this Riad to be frank it was just beautiful. Spacious room spotless rose petals on the bed. The decor in the bathroom or just the Riad in general love! The smells rose petals again hot powerful shower. We just felt taken care of. A part of the Houdou Family. Staff were absolutely lovely.The breakfast on the rooftop just lush. Different options everyday good quality fresh food the orange juice - best I've ever had hands down.    So if you're looking for a wonderful experience in Marrakesh a Riad that is a safe haven from the chaos outside with beautiful views yummy food good people where you get to actually sleep comfy beds! Plus the beauty of this Riad is you are not even 15 minutes away from the square. You can walk to the Maison de la photographie museum and Ben Youssef Madrasa in just 5 minutes.    All I can honestly say is I loved this Riad and it added to the wonderful experience I had in Marrakesh. I will definitely stay here again.

Riad Houdou,redgreenyyz wrote a review Jan 2016,50,Excellent riad experience,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Riad Houdou and especially the personal touch from the two owners and their lovely staff. Eric and Didier have put a lot of care and attention into the renovation and decoration of the Riad including a new hammam/spa center. The owners were always around to answer questions and they take pride in being present at the Riad.    We ate two excellent evening meals there prepared by the talented chefs. Breakfasts were also fantastic and were served on the roof terrace. The staff were attentive and pleasant and the care and hospitality shown to each guest really shows.    It’s a good idea to book the airport pick-up through the Riad if you are unfamiliar with the Medina. The taxi will drop you off and a porter will wheel your luggage the rest of the way. After you settle in the hosts will make sure you are comfortable getting to and from the main square and will accompany you the first time to show you the way through this vibrant neighbourhood.    We will stay here next time.    Wifi was ok for surfing.,Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Stockholm, Sweden",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/redgreenyyz

The Riad is very cozy decorated and offering with its patio and roof terrace place to relax whilst not exploring the Medina.  We had 2 nights dinner and i have to say that the food served in Houdou was much more better than in any recommended restaurant in Marrakesh.  Also we used the service of Massage and Hamam and we very much enjoyed this.  On arrival we had a warm welcome from Diddier and Eric who explained to us the Riad and the surrounding area It was very helpful.

Riad Houdou,Sarah h wrote a review Jan 2016,50,Would stay again!,My boyfriend and I stayed here for NYE 2015. Having never stayed in a riad before I was unsure what to expect but I can honestly say it was amazing!    The Riad experience is so much more personal than a hotel. We found it a perfect place to relax and unwind.    The owners Didier and Eric were extremely helpful. They provided local tips and knowledge to assist with navigating around the markets. The staff in the Riad were friendly and welcoming. They could not have done more to make us feel at home... and luckily for us they spoke very good English!    The food in the Riad was superb however Didier was more than happy to assist with recommending and booking other local restaurants if required. We attended the NYE party which served an amazing fusion of French/Moroccan food.    During our 3 night stay we used the Riad's hamman and spa (full body massage) both which were very relaxing and of a high standard. My boyfriend and I were even allowed to have the hamman together unlike others in the city.

Riad Houdou,Stacey P wrote a review Jan 2016,50,Outstanding. Perfect balance between a Moroccan experience and western tourism comforts,Where to start? Eric Didier and their team made our week long stay in Marrakech superb. It would not have been nearly as good as it was if we weren't staying at Riad Houdou. We had the pleasure of spending New Years Eve in the Riad. An experience we will remember forever due to their hospitality and amazing attention to detail.    We were made to feel welcome - genuinely welcome. The service was perfect. It was attentive without being intrustive. The team let you set the 'pace' of your time there. If you want to interract and engage they are there; if you don't they leave you alone. They have this amazing knack of knowing what type of traveller you are and sharing with you the right type and amount of information. They listen to you and respond. The service is desire to help not a process. They have incredible knowledge of their environment and Morocco's history delivered in a helpful and generous way. So refreshing.    I'll start with the venue. It's a small riad so you get to interact with other guests as you please. It is small enough to meet others but the way Didier and Eric have designed the common areas is such that you don't feel like you're encroaching on others or them on you.    Each bedroom is characterised by a Moroccan cultural piece. We stayed in the Tajine Room which consisted of a comfortable queen size bed cupboard with hanging and shelf space enough for two people and with a couch and coffee table. We were welcomed with fresh flowers and cookies. The shower was hot and were provided with lovely bathroom amenities. Wifi is free and is faultless. It works throughout the riad including on the terrace and in your room.    The Riad is located about ten minutes' walk from Place Jemma El Fna. The walk is a simple route so you can enjoy 'getting lost' when you're out and about - not on the way home. Your first trip to the Square is escorted by Didier or Eric with landmarks pointed out so it's easy to familiarise yourself with the fascinating chaotic small alleyways and souks. You are provided a customised map and a briefing on key points including cultural and tourism necessities as well as insights into the current scams to avoid. Invaluable advice I'm not convinced you would get in many places.    We went to many of the restaurants on the Riad's map and were pleased with all. We highly recommend I Limoni (Italian and Moroccan) and Dar Tazi (a simply homely Moroccan place very close to the Riad).    Breakfast is available on the sunny terrace (with hats and shade if you prefer) whenever you are ready and is a lovely mix of Moroccan and French influence: homemade jams and pastries eggs bread tea and great espressos!    Every second night we ate in the Riad for dinner. It was the best Moroccan food we had all week by far. It was traditional Morrocan with modern influence. Impeccable. Being vegetarian was not a problem....in fact my carniverous husband chose the vegetarian option one night which I have never known him to do!    The Riad has a plunge pool but we didn't use it as it was not hot enough when we were in Marrakech. The Hammam was amazing and a must do for every visitor. Notice is needed so that the Hammam can be heated and your preferred treatment (for massage and facial) prepared freshly. If your stay is short be sure to book it in before you arrive.    We did two day trips out of Marrakech. Both were made incredibly easy by Didier and Eric. Despite one of these trips being booked directly by me Didier and Eric conducted all the communciations about the transfer which I couldn't have done alone.    When we booked with Riad Houdou we planned on playing our New Year's plans by ear. After staying one night we knew we would have an amazing time in-house so they kindly accomodated our last minute request to join. We were spoiled with an incredible dinner two live Moroccan music groups lovely Moroccan wine and the sensational company of Didier and Eric their friends and family and fellow guests. It was an unexpected but amazing New Years for us.    I've spoken a lot about Eric and Didier but of course they are supported by a team. They were incredibly friendly hugely patient with our lack of Arabic and French clearly committed to Didier Eric the Riad and comfort of the guests. We were so impressed by the cooking service and genuine desire to make sure you have a comfortable time at Riad Houdou.    All the logistics aside what made it amazing is Dider and Eric's love of Morocco and genuine desire for others to also appreciate it. They have made considerable effort to embrace the Moroccan culture including learning Arabic. Marrakech can be a confronting place. Eric and Didier don't apologise for that or try to shield you from it . What they do is let you have the experience but ease the rough edges for short term visitors. They themselves are well seasoned travellers who love their new home. That shows in everything they do through their Riad. A real inspiration for any traveller.,Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/journey2gether
Riad Houdou,McJourneyman wrote a review Jan 2016,50,An Excellent Choice,I seldom find the time to leave reviews but in this case even though it has taken me some time I felt I absolutely must ! Myself my wife and our young baby spent the first 4 days of our Moroccan holiday in Riad Houdou and we are very glad we did. We had a great experience throughout our holiday but this Riad really was the ideal place to start. As soon as we booked Didier was in touch to arrange our transfer from the airport a meal upon our arrival and advice regarding possible excursions. I knew right away that we were going to be looked after.    We arrived in the middle of a drum festival with plenty of noise and activity on the streets outside however inside the Riad was peaceful and relaxing. Didier Eric Aziz and all of the staff were very helpful throughout our stay. Didier walked us all the way into Jamaa el Fna square (roughly a 10min walk) and pointed out some easy landmarks that ensured we never got lost. There is plenty of interest in the vicinity of the Riad and we were given lots of helpful recommendations on places to visit. We ate at the Riad on two occasions and were very very impressed - the food here was among the best we had during our entire stay - traditional Moroccan cuisine but done with real flair.    I note a recent review where a guest states that this Riad doesn't warrant a 5-Star rating because it doesn't compare to the great prestigious hotels of the world! I think he misses the point. We deliberately didn't stay in a modern hotel in the newer part of Marrakesh - we wanted an authentic Moroccan experience not a generic and sterile Western one - Riad Houdou puts you safely and comfortably in the heart of historical Marrakesh - it was definitely the right choice for us !,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/McJourneyman
Riad Houdou,trudy2410 wrote a review Dec 2015,40,Great Riad in middle of Medina,This Riad run by Eric and Didier is a lovely place to stay in the chaos of the Medina. I arranged a pick up with Didier from the airport which is essential as we would never have found it on our own. We were greeted with mint tea and some sweet cakes before we settled into our rooms. The rooms are typical Riad style and not like your usual Hotel but we wanted an authentic Morrocan experience and that's what we got. The Riad is beautifully decorated with interesting art and has a lovely rooftop where breakfast is served in the morning. Unfortunately we didn't have hot water for 2 days but this was sorted by Didier as soon as possible and we were given a reduction in our bill these things do happen and they dealt with the problem. Didier and Eric were always happy to answer questions and give advise in English which was very useful. My son had a Hamman in the Riad and really enjoyed it. Breakfast was great the yoghurt was to die for the best I have ever tested. You also got fresh fruit pastries jams bread and eggs if you asked for them. We ordered a meal for the first night at the Riad as I had read how good they were. We were a bit disappointed there was no choice and the starter was not eaten by our 2 teenagers and it was not my favourite dish. The main course was a tangine which was very tasty but it didn't come with anything we thought perhaps some couscous would appear but it didn't. Dessert was some sorbet and a rather dry cake which was also a little disappointing. However we did have 2 lunches meatballs and salad which was good and an omelette which was superb so maybe we just were unlucky with our evening meal. Marrakesh is a chaotic mad city but interesting and definitely worth a visit and I would recommend you stay at Riad Houdou for a friendly comfortable holiday.,Date of stay: December 2015,,wiltshire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trudy2410

Riad Houdou,Lulu A wrote a review Dec 2015,50,True Experience of a Riad in the middle of the hustle & bustle,They always say if you want to experience the real deal of a city be like one of the locals. Stay where the heart is walk like how they walk.    Riad Houdou is tucked in the spinning streets of Marrakesh Medina. A true Riad (garden) in the middle of the hustle & bustle. We rode a taxi and sent us to the street that leads to the Riad. (Be careful of these guys who are trying to lead you to the hotel because they will be asking for money). The hotel is just right at the end of the street and easy to locate.    Once you arrive you will feel the warm welcome of the staff. Both Eric & Didier were very very accomodating. They will give you a tour of the Medina explain the things you need to know and answer questions that you have specially if it is your first time. Once you have settled into your room (which were all well moroccan themed) and you are ready to explore the Medina they will accompany you outside showing you the way and the spots to look for (taxi places & shops/ places to visit & to avoid). It was a breeze and a delight right after and all of the worries will be gone.    We had dinner as well together with the other guest that was heart warming. We have the specially made dinner from their Homebased Chef and it was my first time to have a cooked lamb and it was sublime!!    That dinner was really good as you will have the chance to interact with new people who are travelling as well and also with Eric and Didier. You can also request for wine or other beverages for dinner as they dont mention it on the menu.    The breakfast at the top terrace was pretty amazing too. The sunshine and the greens are great way to start the morning. Eric and Didier will be there in the morning to see everything is fine.    Truly a wonderful experience and worth the money that you paid for. All smiles and welcome.,Date of stay: December 2015,,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/null
Riad Houdou,Cesafdar35 wrote a review Dec 2015,50,Really genuinely comfortable,We loved this place. It is comfortable and quiet. The food is excellent. We tried a few other places out for lunch but frankly they were nowhere near as good and ate here every night. The breakfast was excellent.  I appreciate that this isn't a five star hotel but our room was clean quiet tasteful with warm comfortable beds so my five stars is inclusive of value for money and the pleasantness of our stay. It might be less luxurious than a five star hotel but I have ever felt more relaxed in any kind of paid establishment. It felt like staying with a particularly accommodating relative.  The hosts did everything they could to accommodate us. Breakfast is normally at 8:30 until whenever but need it at six not a problem. Don't usually serve lunch but got a later flight no problem. Room a little cold no problem here's a heater. You want company no problem. You want to be left on your own no problem have a book. Got two kids no problem  The location is great easy to walk to major attractions and the host will explain how to get anywhere else.,Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cesafdar35
Riad Houdou,Lolochuso wrote a review Dec 2015,50,Weekend off in Marrakech,Me and my friend went to Marrakech from London for the weekend. We were told to stay in a Riad after doing a bit of research we decided to go to Riad Hondou. The experience was great nice place really well decorated and located just 10 mins walking from Jemaa el-Fnaa. Eric walked with us the first time to the square which was quite useful he showed us a couple of references and we always found our way back to the Riad. I recommend staying in a Riad in Medina while in Marrakech specially Riad Hondou!

Riad Houdou,Timothy_Adams wrote a review Nov 2015,20,A good bet for some visitors ... but know what you're booking,As I write I think of the twenty minute walk that hotelier Didier took with me after check-in to arrange laundry service and change bills at the Jemaa el-Fna. The walk wasn't part of the package; he set aside twenty minutes just to accommodate a guest.    I dearly wish I could award more stars but was badly misled by the too-generous reviews of other guests and don't want to commit the same error. Star rankings are supposed to indicate more than good will. It is comical madness to rank this humble riad alongside legit 5 star hotels like the Hong Kong Crowne Plaza or Dubai Movenpick.    Positives:    (*) Didier Eric and other staff deserve the praise given by other reviewers. They do their best to roll out the red carpet and volunteered to change the breakfast time to accommodate my schedule.    (*) Their taste is excellent. The riad is attractively furnished with a style unlikely to be seen at chain hotels.    (*) The riad is near the heart of the medina. Tourists won't have to travel far to see what warrants seeing in Marrakech; they'll be in the thick of things.    And now the negatives as much as it may pain me to list them:    (*) The peace-and-quiet seeking guest may be at the mercy of other visitors. New arrivals ate dinner in the central patio on the last night of my stay. I heard most everything they said while in my room wouldn't have been able to sleep through their conversation if they'd carried on into the night.    (*) Please see my shots of the heater air conditioner and toilet. Accommodations here are primitive. The room safe was too small for my computer and my room was insecurely locked with a small padlock. I computed on a rickety coffee table walked on bare stone floors made do without a room coffee maker. Breakfast was little more than pastries rolls coffee and orange juice. My INWI sim card provided data service throughout Marrakech but not in my room. I gather that reception is iffy in much of the hotel.    This riad may be an excellent bet for guests who don't mind roughing it. One gets what one pays for perhaps; a Riad Houdou patron may pay far less than a guest at a conventional hotel outside the Medina. That said: I won't be back and dearly wish that other tripadvisor reviewers had given me the lowdown on this riad. I don't think the 5 star reviews are fake but do think they were written by guests who want to be nice to Didier and Eric. You were nice to them fellow tripadvisors but mean to me.    My local Inwi sim card provided excellent GPS service in Marrakech and I had no trouble finding the hotel from a nearby 19 bus stop. If you don't feel comfortable popping in a smartphone sim and using the appropriate app you'll probably want to use the hotel's transport service or follow Didier's recommendation to take a cab at least as far as the Place Moukef.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Los Angeles, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Timothy_Adams
Riad Houdou,lonewolf_memi wrote a review Nov 2015,50,Great stay,Actually it is not easy to write something new about Riad Houdou since the majority of the guests had already used the best words for it. Didier and Eric are very pleasant and made the best effort to make us feel at easy. Hospitality at its best is what you get here. I mean that kindness and polite attitude is somewhat people expect at hotels andin the whole is given almost everywhere: well at Houdou it goes far beyond and the staff treat you as old friends not seen for long. I have had appreciate the exhaustive 'briefing' Didier gave us about Medina and stuff to be know before escort us to main square and let us safely exploring the downtown. The surrounding of the Road is very impressive and at first sight appears scary: a mess of people sounds scents and some smells embedding you. With Didier's help we got acquaintanded in a fingers snap and had much fun. Great stay highly recommended!

Riad Houdou,assimil wrote a review Nov 2015,50,"Great hospitality and beautiful, comfortable interior",I stayed there with my wife 4 days mid Novomber every time we came back from the Medina we were happy we chose this riad. From the first hallo to goodbye everyone there was extremely polite and helpful. The owners - Eric and Didier- and all the staff especially Aziz who is exceptionally kind and sicerely firendly. We were also very happy with all the advice they gave and especially with the day trip to Ourika Valley with their driver Ahmed highly recommended. All in all we could hardly have chosen better and regreted when we had to leave. I could stay there a few more days only for their roof tarras and the peaceful inside riad. Very clean comfortable and traditionally equipped place in the middle of most of the Medina attractions.

Riad Houdou,kkpeyton1 wrote a review Nov 2015,50,Perfect start to our trip,Our first stop on our trip to Morocco was Riad Houdou and we couldn't have hoped for a more comfortable or more welcoming start to our trip. Upon booking the owners gave us perfect instructions for how to navigate through the medina to reach the property. We arrived with no issue and were welcomed with delicious tea and beautiful homemade pastries. When we wanted to check out the main square they personally walked us there through the medina making sure we noted all the important landmarks that would help us find our way back. Beautiful breakfasts served on the rooftop terrance were a great way to start the morning and we were pleased with the recommended restaurants. We never ate dinner at the Riad but wish we'd had the chance to try it as I assume it would have been wonderful. The rooms were comfortable clean and nicely decorated. We found the riad to be very peaceful with a beautiful courtyard.

Riad Houdou,DIannah L wrote a review Nov 2015,50,Simply Heaven,Riad Houdou is simply the best accommodation experience I have had anywhere. It is run by two of the nicest warmest people you can come across they make you feel completely welcome and attend to your every need. On arrival they make sure you get your bearings in terms of making your way around the Medina (which is really a necessity) by actually walking you to the main market place and personally showing you around. Our room 'The Tagine Room' was beautiful it has its own little balcony overlooking the pool. It is clean comfortable and a wonderful quiet space to come home to in the evenings. The breakfasts are delicious they are served on the terrace and if you choose to do so you can dine at the riad in the evenings (we found this a lovely way to end the day after the bustle of the Medina). The evening meals are sumptuous delicious authentic Morroccan meals prepared by the riad's chef. All in all this riad is faultless.

No effort was spared in making sure that we had everything we needed and nothing was too much trouble. It is in a fabulous location just 10 minutes walk from the main square and Eric walked us there on our first morning to make sure we knew how to get back at the end of the day!

Riad Houdou,BenGerrish wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Amazing stay...would recommend to anyone!,Although we arrived late at night the hospitality was still top notch! Fresh mint tea and traditional Moroccan pastries upon arrival in the courtyard and a tour of the Riad and our excellent room. Breakfast took inspiration from Moroccan cuisine for example fig preserve and orange blossom yoghurt but included some aspects of continental breakfast too including eggs cooked to how you want and fresh bread.    Our room was spotless and it's clear that the cleaners put real effort into making sure the room is as clean and tidy as possible; even as much as putting shoes in an organised fashion all in the same place. There is air-con and free wifi. There is a chance to escape the busy streets in the city and relax in the sun on the roof terrace.

In short it was one of the best hotel experiences we have had anywhere in the world - I'm sure we'll be back someday.    Overall I cannot imagine a better value for the money. The Riad is clean quiet and comfortable. The location is very central and convenient (but definitely book an airport transfer for the first journey to the Riad) The food was delicious authentic and elegantly served. Breakfast was great every day and the dinner was amazing - an absolute must as others have commented. We had a Hammam scrub and a massage both of which were excellent and highly recommended. I was looking to book a day trip outside the city myself but the Riad was able to steer us directly to a local English-speaking guide at a better price (we went hiking near Amizmiz - also great).    The staff was so friendly and helpful - no request was too big or too small for them to provide great service.

Riad Houdou,Josine D wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Excellent Riad in Marrakech,"Riad Houdou is a little jewel in the heart of the Medina. It is a very quiet place in a city where your senses work overtime. Due to its location it is 5 minutes walking distance to many of the highlights of the old city.  The service is very good and the food is absolutely fantastic. Breakfast is on the roof top and if you wish dinner will be prepared for you. You can either eat on the cosy inner courtyard with fruit trees and fountain or in a room adjacent to the inner courtyard.  The entire staff makes you feel very welcome and are willing to help with whatever you need at any time. They can offer great suggestions and handy tips for when you visit.  The rooms look great and no small detail is overlooked. The riad has its private hamam and a full ""hamam"" menu from which you can make your desired choice.

Riad Houdou,David T wrote a review Sep 2015,50,4 days in Paradise!,We (my wife 2 daughters and I) stayed at the Riad Houdou from August 2 to August 6 2015. This was the last few days of a great vacation we had in Morocco with many beautiful places visited and many great meals and sightseeing in the way. That remains clearly as THE MOST MEMORABLE PLACE WE HAVE SEEN OR BEEN TO IN MORROCCO. From the get-go we were received as if we were the homeowners by Didier and Eric. In fact I think this summarizes pretty well: for 4 days and 4 nights we had the feeling that we owned a Riad in Marrakech and that we had hired the best staff in the worl to make sure we would get anything we want whenever we wanted it.  We stayed in the Suite aux Epices a beautifully decorated room delicately perfumed (as-is the entire Riad with fresh flowers everywhere) and furnished. Didier took us to the Place Jemaa el Fna the first evening and gave us very useful tips to make sure we would easily find our way back no matter what. We had dinner at the Riad the first night and the food (served in the patio for or family exclusive that night) was simply exquisite. Quite frankly on par with a one star Michelin. All house made using fresh produce from the markets a fantastic presentation for each plate marvelous table setting refined service all along… Unbelievable for less than 20 Euros per head! Do NOT stay there without having dinner at the Riad at least once. In fact it was so good that we decided to have dinner at the Riad our last night there too – we share it with Eric Didier and Didier’s sister and we had a great night as if we had spent it with friends and we were quite sad to leave for the airport on August 6 morning. In between those 2 meals everything was perfect with fantastic breakfasts readily available advises whenever we needed some (Didier organized for us a day at the Beldi Country Club pool that I really recommend if you are in Marrakech between June and September). Our 9 and 11 yo daughters enjoyed it equally playing with the cat the turtles and looking (unsuccessfully I must say) for the chameleon in the lemon tree. Coming back to this oasis of peace and luxury was always a pleasure after spending hours in the frantic streets of Marrakech.  We will not even try to look for any other place if we come back to Marrakech – it is really hard to imagine that ther can be a better value for money than Riad Houdou.

Riad Houdou,Barson10 wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Perfect stay at Riad Houdou,From booking our stay at the Riad Houdou to leaving our experience was fantastic. Didier e-mailed us before we arrived asking us if we wanted to book an airport transfer for €15 (we fully recommend you do this as its hassle free) and whether we wanted dinner on the first night or to take advantage of any experiences (hamman massage excursions).    On arriving at Marrakech airport the transfer was waiting as described with a sign saying Riad Houdou. On arrival at the Houdou both Eric and Didier provided a warm welcome with mint tea and pastries - amazing!! Once we'd had time to rest they provided us with lots of valuable information and tips for our stay - we would have been lost without this! They also provided us with a tour to the main square - showing us how to get their and pointing out main landmarks so that we'd remember how to get back easily. Again this was incredibly valuable.    We had dinner at the Riad on the first and last nights and the food was amazing. We really should of ate here every night!! Compliments to Rajaa as the meals and breakfasts were really exceptional - every morning we had something different for breakfast and we really liked the chutneys. On my husband's birthday he was also presented with some pastries with a candle in. I'm quite fussy with what I eat and they accommodated my requests with no complaints at all.    The Riad itself and our room (Tagine) were very stylishly decorated. The room was perfect size and it was a good balance between modern and old style. There was also free wifi. In addition to our room there was the roof terrace and courtyard to relax.    Didier and Eric also arranged the hamman and massage experience for us and we recommend that you also take advantage of this and we felt incredibly relaxed after.    We had to leave early on our last day (before normal breakfast times). But breakfast was served early which we really appreciated.    Overall our experience at the Riad was second to none.

Riad Houdou,Jodie545 wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Hidden Gem!,I did a lot of research before I travelled to Marrakech having been told that the variation in accommodation is vast and settled on the Riad Houdou following good recommendations on Trip Advisor.    Myself and my partner were not disappointed in any way. The welcome we received at the Houdou was second to none. Eric and Didier (the owners)made us feel so welcome and the hard work they have put in to building up their business shines through in everything.    The staff are friendly knowledgeable and engaging. The food is amazing. The location is great and I know this phrase is oft used but the Houdou is an oasis in a bustling Medina. Calm quiet and very comfortable. The communication from Eric and Didier before our travel put us at ease. And Eric kindly gave us an orientation walk on our first morning to ensure we would be able to return safely after our day of exploring.    The Riad tortoises and evasive chameleon (I found him on the last 10 minutes of our 3 night stay!) were lovely.    Oh and the homemade Orange Blossom yoghurt is to die for!    I want to tell everybody to go to the Houdou but worry that I may not be able to get a reservation the next time we travel there. A risk I am willing to take!!

I spent a lot of time researching riads in the Medina and as soon as we arrived at Riad Houdou I knew that it was going to be perfect. We were welcomed by Eric one of the two charming owners who served us mint tea and took us through a map of the Medina pointing out a range of the best things to visit and giving us advice about the right prices to pay for taxis and horse drawn carriages and tips for haggling! He then accompanied us to Jemaa al Fna square pointing out all the key landmarks so we wouldn't get lost! We ate in the riad on two of our three nights and not only had the best food of our stay but really enjoyed excellent company and conversation as unless you prefer a private dining experience - which is fine - it is a real treat for the guests owners and new friends to eat and chat together.    Hearing about Eric and Didier's experience of restoring the Riad Houdou and meeting their staff who have been them since the Riad opened was lovely - they are clearly a great team. You will be able to see from the pictures that the riad is absolutely beautiful very sensitively restored and decorated with traditional art with some modern and quirky twists.    The Hammam experience was a particular highlight. Rob and I chose a ""couples"" experience where we were scrubbed with black soap exfoliating the skin wonderfully and this was followed by the best massage I've ever had. Breakfast too served on the roof terrace was terrific Rajaa their cook is really talented and we loved the home made yoghurts breads patties eggs. pancakes and jams.

Riad Houdou,Navdroid wrote a review Aug 2015,50,Amazing local hotel,I have recently been to Marakkech and stayed at Riad Houdou. I must say the hotel offers fantastic staying experience in one of the traditional built Riad in Morocco. I was pleasantly surprised when I was greeted by owners of the hotel and had tea (and homemade sweets) with them! does not happen often. Didier kept us well informed via e-mail about how to reach the hotel as well as how to avoid locals messing up with tourists. Eric has provided a nice tour of Riad before I went to my room. Riad Houdou remained super flexible accommodating all our needs as per our plan of the day and were very hospitable. An amazing breakfast we included in the room rent and it was awesome!

Riad Houdou,Parikshit B wrote a review Aug 2015,50,Excellent accommodation in a excellent location,The room was good. Most importantly the hosts were very welcoming. We had a request for an early breakfast which was arranged at a short notice. and the breakfast was really nice. The location of this riad is practically 7 minutes from the main square which is great. Plenty of options to eat out and soak in the atmosphere. It is also very close to airport (around 20 minutes drive).

Riad Houdou,SN1505 wrote a review Jul 2015,40,Haven of hospitality,The riad is beautifully decorated and really is a haven from the hustle and bustle outside. It's very conveniently located very close to the Maison de Photographie and the main square.The room itself was very spacious and a welcome change after sharing a more compact room over the last a few days. We were there for just two nights.    We were well taken care of by the staff and Eric & Didier make it a point to walk guests from the riad to the main square pointing out places of interest etc so that we find it easy to make our way back on our own. A unique feature of a stay at Riad Houdou is dinner with Eric Didier and any other guests which makes for an enjoyable evening. Thank you team Houdou for your hospitality.,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SN1505
Riad Houdou,Rayecyd wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Highly Recommended,Had a wonderful experience in this Riad. The hosts Eric and Didier were super friendly and helpful. The staff in the Riad were all wonderful as well. The location first of all were fantastic very easily to find in the busy medina of Marrakech. We were also shown around the medina by the host to bring us to the main square. The rooms and the Riad are beautifully furnished and the food were just exceptional. Would recommend travellers to order their dinner as it is the best food I have eaten in Morocco. If ever I visit Marrakech again without any hesitation I would stay in this Riad again!,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rayecyd
Riad Houdou,JJ G wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Extremely Satisfied,Marrakesh is a bustling culture that can almost be overwhelming. Thanks to Didier Eric and the rest of the staff my friend and I had an easy time navigating around the Medina.    As for the actual Riad it's very clean air conditioned and beautifully decorated.    The included breakfast was very good and our last day we were even accommodated at 4 am so we could eat before our early flight.    Highly recommend this place for anyone looking to visit Marrakesh.

Riad Houdou,boscojr wrote a review Jun 2015,50,Wonderful welcome to Marrakech,Didier was very helpful answering a lot of advance questions we had about Marrakech as well as setting up transportation from the airport to the Riad. He also suggested that our family do a trip to Imlil to have lunch with a Berber family which he also arranged. This trip was wonderful everybody (including our 2 kids ages 9 and 12) gave it two very enthusiastic thumbs up. We did not have the pleasure of meeting Didier as he was away when we arrived but Eric gave us so great personal attention and made us feel like special guests. Our room was perfect for the 4 of us and all of the food we had at the Riad (dinner and breakfast) was excellent.,Date of stay: June 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Leland, North Carolina",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/boscojr
Riad Houdou,JN1222 wrote a review Jun 2015,50,More amazing than can be described.,Before traveling to Marrakech we literally looked at probably 3 dozen riads on TripAdvisor before deciding on Riad Houdou. We absolutely made the best decision. The staff is so friendly & accommodating waiting on us hand and foot. From the location to the room to the food- everything about this place is 100%. Eric & Didier contacted us prior to our trip and asked if we had any preferences and let us know about possible add-ons to our stay- spa services excursions etc. They arranged for us to be picked up at the airport and brought to the riad. I honestly think that the food we were served there surpasses any restaurant in all of Marrakech and may be some of the best food I've ever had in my life. The breakfasts are simple and delicious but I fully recommend opting to pay 20 euro to eat an amazing three course dinner at the beautiful riad each evening. If you're anything like us you probably want to research the 100+ riads on TripAdvisor- but honestly Riad Houdou is more than amazing and you will LOVE staying there. If we make the trip to Marrakech again we will absolutely stay again!,Date of stay: June 2015,,"Chicago, IL",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JN1222

Riad Houdou,fortunefaded wrote a review Jun 2015,50,Great authentic experience,Eric and Didier have really made this Riad special. I was one of five friends who stayed in two rooms for two nights in June 2015. We all had a great time here. The location is in the heart of the Medina and 10-15min walk to the main square and markets. The Riad itself is beautiful and it really did feel like coming to Eric and Didier's home every day! We spent a lot of time chilling in the courtyard which was great. The breakfast was simple but tasty. We had lunch and dinner once at the Riad and it was excellent. The group has some fussy eaters with various requirements but nearly all were accommodated. However the staff are the real stars of this place they were all fantastic.

Riad Houdou,Catriona G wrote a review Jun 2015,50,Amazing from start to finish!,"We booked to go to Marrakech for my friends 30th birthday celebrations and chose to stay at Riad Houdou. We are so glad we did! Everything was amazing from the minute we walked in to the minute we left.  Eric Didier Asis and all of the staff were so friendly welcoming & accommodating!  We booked the transfer from the airport through the Riad & we were greeted at the airport taken to the Riad and our cases taken straight to our rooms whilst we were welcomed with mint tea & pastries.  We were then given a tour of the beautiful Riad shown our rooms & then Eric gave us a talk through the main attractions of Marrakech. We were then shown the way to the main square by a member of staff so we wouldn't get lost which was a lovely touch & very very helpful!  You can book lunch & dinner in at the Riad but you need to book dinner in by 11am so we arrived a bit too late but after not being able to get anywhere to deliver the cook advised she would be able to ""rustle something up"" which we were so grateful for but when we were presented with an utterly brilliant 3 course meal we were amazed and very happy.  We had breakfast at the Riad every day lunch once & dinner twice & it was all so tasty varied & of such high standards that we were hard pushed to beat it anywhere else.  When we did eat out Eric & Didier were more than helpful in making reservations for us.  On my friends 30th they allowed us to put banners up in the main courtyard at breakfast had birthday music set up ready to play gave her a Riad souvenir and brought a cake out with a candle.  There is also a spa area in the Riad where it can be arranged for people to come in and do hamman spa's and massages. All 4 of us had the hamman and exfoliation & 2 followed this with a massage. It was all so good & relaxing as well as being such great value for money.  The roof terrace is a beautiful space for sunbathing.  The only advice i would give would be on Marrakech itself - try to stay out of Old town after 9pm ish (if we returned we would stay at Riad Houdou again without a shadow of a doubt but would dine in of an evening) and i'd warn the ladies to be ready for several sexual comments from the locals when you walk through the streets & Souks.

Riad Houdou,Russell W wrote a review Jun 2015,50,A Jewel in the Medina,I have been lucky to have travelled to Marrakech several times over the last few years and to soak up the authentic experience have always tried to stay in the Medina.  The Riad Houdou is a Riad above exception with a personal service that creates a warm atmosphere of being with friends rather then staying at a hotel or a guest house. Eric Didier and all their wonderful staff have taken the time to see what is important for a guest and make it happen.  We stayed in the Babouche room with its roof top terrace and pretty much had the place to ourselves.  We will be staying here again on our next travels to morocco - and this time we will bring friends.  The downsides ? - The only one is that this place is so good and relaxing with great food and atmosphere its difficult to leave to see the rest of Marrakech.  Cant wait to come back.  The personal touch ??? - we ate a meal on the first night with a delicious aubergine soup we mentioned that we really enjoyed it and 2 days ago we received an email from Eric and Didier with the recipe,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/740russellw

Our room (barbouche) with its private terrace was so romantic and having dinner on the terrace on our first night was truly memorable. we have stayed in lots of great hotels around the world but have never experienced such personal service where nothing is too much trouble and you are welcomed as friends rather than paying guests. Needless to say we are planning our next trip to Marrakech and could only stay with Eric and Didier at the riad houdou. See you soon my friends.

Excellent location in the heart of the Medina within comfortable walking distance of the main square & sights.  Bedrooms are decorated using typical Moroccan items with a modern twist full of atmosphere & character. We stayed in the Fez room... very comfy beds plenty of storage space and a traditional Tadelakt shower room with local toiletries. Breakfast was a very relaxed affair (no set time) served on the tranquil tiled patio area under citrus trees and next to a tinkling fountain. The food cooked by Raja was excellent we enjoyed a superb dinner at the Riad with 2 other guests and Eric & Didier. Fantastic food company and conversation made for a truly memorable evening. Highly recommended!!  The owners Eric & Didier and their staff were outstanding... so generous with their time and helpful with advice and directions even accompanying us to the main square and pointing out landmarks so we could easily retrace our steps.

The owners organised our taxis arranged a fabulous mule trip in the Atlas Mountains and even contacted a cooking school for us to reserve places on a course a previous guest had enthused about. A great day out.  Despite my initial reservations of travelling with two daughters and no husbands I soon became relaxed thanks to calm and knowledgable advice from our hosts.  We had a fabulous time the food (especially the home made breakfast yoghurt!) was equal to 5* hotels I have eaten in around the globe and the Riad clean welcoming and very comfortable.

Didier and Eric provide the highest level of service whilst making you feel like you are staying with family or old friends. Our room was comfortable beautifully decorated and smelled gorgeous :)    The whole riad has been renovated to perfection and is incredibly clean. The staff are warm helpful and always smiling. Nothing is too much trouble you have only to ask and they deliver above and beyond your expectations.    We had dinner at the riad 3 or 4 nights and of course ate breakfast there everyday. The food is absolutely wonderful and some of the best we had in all of Marrakech. The chef Raja cooks with a lot of love and has a deep knowledge of Moroccan cuisine. She was even kind enough to let me cook with her!    We had two excursions organised through the riad and airport pick up/drop off. All of it was very well planned and totally stress-free. Didier and Eric are the real stars of the show they are kind and interesting men and have so much knowledge about what to see and experience in the city that they enrich the whole experience.

Riad Houdou,Lellowone wrote a review Apr 2015,50,No Doubt In My Mind - this is one of the best Riads in allll of Marrakech!!!,"From the moment we sent an email to this Riad inquiring on a stay to the moment we checked out we had stellar service and attention paid to our needs! Eric and Didier are the proprieters of this charming Riad centrally located to souk shopping and a Moukef Square where you can get a taxi easily (Eric and Didier will arrange this for you) and you can get a trolley for your luggage for only 20 durham ($2). It's really an overwhelming experience to be in the Medina the first time but Eric and Didier eased our minds with their prepartory emails and then their warm welcome and tour to the main square. Literally the walked with us to show us the way!! What hotel mananager or concierge will do that with you?! None!! Breakfast was included in the price and the chef was so amazing that we had a dinner there too (it's only around $20 for a lovely 3 course meal). We went site seeing after checking in and we were only a 20 minute walk from Bahia Palace and the Saadian Tombs. We also were close to Bahii Palace so we hit that one as well. The main square is only about 15 minutes and you can catch a horse and buggy there to take you to the Majorelle Gardens. GORGEOUS!! And Didier made sure that we didn''t pay the 600 durham that they initially charge. He told us to stay firm at 200 and they will take you wait for you to walk around and take you back to the square. It was great to know all this ""insider information"". The rooms were stunning - there is a private roof for suntanning or having a sunset cocktail....it was just a magical place!

Didier and Eric had great hospitality and made sure my friend and I were well accommodated for everything we needed - even before we arrived in Morocco they were in constant email contact! We were two girls traveling and it was important to us that we were staying in a safe environment.    The location of the riad is great! Didier and Eric take turns walking all their guests around the area when you arrive to make sure you know where you are going and point out spots so we didn't get lost. This was so helpful and this service alone was the reason why I chose to stay at this riad.    Additionally I have a wheat/gluten food allergy and they made sure I could taste local specialties with all gluten free meals for me! Dinner with them was one of the best meals we had on our trip and it is definitely worth eating at the riad. It was especially nice to meet the other travelers/get to know Didier and Eric as we all sat together at one table. We all compared our travel stories and it felt like a dinner party together!    We stayed in the Tangier Room and it was lovely and very quiet. The decorations were great and we enjoyed the great smelling body lotions/shampoos that they provided.    The garden in the riad was a very relaxing place to sit and enjoy coffee/mint tea while you can check up on emails (they provided fast free internet in the entire riad!) Didier and Eric were very helpful by calling our pre-planned excursions to confirm reservations and made sure different site seeing locations were open for us to see.

Transportation (from and to the airport) was done smoothly and when we arrived the owner welcomed us with mint tea which was very refreshing. Then he showed us around the hotel gave us some tips of visiting places / shopping in the city. The riad itself is placed in a quiet area at night but easy to get an access to a shopping street. We stayed in a family room. The room size was sufficient and nicely decorated with morrocan items.  On the first day he guided us to the city centre (plaza) and gave us some advices to remember at each street corner so we wouldn't get lost. This helped us a lot. We had a dinner at the riad as well. It was typical traditional Morrocan dishes beautifully presentedand well flavoured. The owners (2 French gentlemen) were very supportive and fun to talk to.

Riad Houdou,Clavious wrote a review Mar 2015,50,A beautiful oasis of peace and relaxation in a truly Moroccan medina.,Having had the pleasure of and opportunity to stay within many of Morocco’s wonderful riads I can safely say that my basis for comparison is very solid. However it is very rare for me to write a review after my stay. The fact that I am writing now already speaks volumes to the standard of quality and care by which Riad Houdou is run.    Riad Houdou is an absolute gem of a riad! It is the labor of love of two very charming and agreeable gentlemen Eric and Didier. Located within a “living” part of the medina Riad Houdou’s location imparts to its guests a true sense of what life is like outside of the more touristic realm that is all too often defined as “Moroccan.” To reach the riad one must navigate the hectic streets and lanes of a typical medina neighborhood. But this task is made easy with the readily available assistance of porters (with and without hand carts for luggage) to guide you at the very reasonable cost of 20dh ($2.00 as of today). I certainly considered this cost worth every cent!    Upon arrival at the door of the riad a brief knock will gain you admittance into a wonderful sanctuary of calm and beauty. For those not familiar with the term “riad” it is a traditional Moroccan home that has an open garden in the center. These gardens or ryad in Arabic are typically decorated with a fountain(s) and/or small plants and trees. Riad Houdou does not disappoint in this regard. The garden boasts beautiful fountains amazing orange trees (that were blossoming during my stay) and one extremely well behaved turtle.    Once inside the riad you will be offered a variety of refreshments from which to choose: coffee water tea (many choices including traditional Moroccan tea) and an absolutely wonderful sampling of helua (Moroccan sweet treats).    After a simple and brief check-in we were shown to our room. I was traveling with my wife and 20-something son. Our room was as is the rest of the riad tastefully appointed and decorated with an Art Deco / Traditional Moroccan fusion! It must be noted that throughout the riad this style of decoration is simply fabulous and sets it uniquely apart from its contemporaries. We had a family suite that would very nicely and more than comfortably accommodate a family of four having a large double bed and two singles. The pillows were abundant and extremely comfortable neither of which is otherwise typical in Morocco.    The bathroom was also a treat. My wife and I live and work in Morocco and do not have a bathtub in our home. So when we were shown the bathroom with the oversized garden style tub my wife was extremely happy and made good use of it! There was also a standalone walk-in shower with a rain shower head. Everything from the soaps and lotions to the oversized towels was above par.    When it came to the food offerings again the riad did not disappoint. My family was returning from a 4 day desert trip and I knew that I would not want to go in search of food in the evenings. So I took the option of having meals made each night for my family in the riad. We stayed two nights and it was absolutely the best choice we could have made. Based upon the other reviews and recommendations we opted to have the lamb that was cooked in the local hammam’s oven. I simply cannot overstate the wonderfulness that each meal brought with it. The food was tantalizing to the eye and pure heaven upon the tongue! The skillful plating was far more than I would have hoped for and certainly better than most of the finer restaurants in Marrakesh and certainly equal to that of the celebrated Grand Café de la Poste (having just eaten there). But as good as the food and drink were (and they certainly were) there was something else that was provided to us that simply made our stay all the better; that special something was the company of the two gentlemen that own the riad Didier and Eric. I cannot express in words how completely agreeable and delightful these two hosts were. As I have said this riad is more than just a “pay to sleep” (as told to me by Didier) it is more akin to an intimate gathering of friends and the sharing of food and stories. The meals felt much more like a home coming than a dinner prepared for strangers. We shared a table we shared drinks and we shared smiles.    This review of Riad Houdou would certainly not be complete without mention of the superb people with which it is staffed. From the time that you enter until the sad moment when you leave you will be shown nothing but smiles kindness and an enthusiastic desire to ensure that your stay is exactly as you would like it to be. From the first offer of tea to the at-the-table hand washing at dinner you will be catered to waited upon and above all heard. There was not a request that I made that was not carried out with curtesy politeness and professionalism. The time and effort that Didier and Eric have expended in trying to acquire the perfect staff has certainly paid off. They are simply awesome.    If I were given my choice of any place to stay in Marrakech it would not take the blink of an eye to reach my decision. I would simply choose to stay with our new friends in their house in the medina and it just happens to be called Riad Houdou.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Dammam, Saudi Arabia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Clavious

Riad Houdou,lisa W wrote a review Mar 2015,50,what a wonderful riad greats hosts,Eric Didier and staff made this riad stay so enjoyable they cant do enough for you. our room was Moroccan themed with western touches really thought about their guests . for the price we paid the hotel more than exceeded our expectations. we took their advise of using their transfer service and so glad we did especially if arriving after dark its hard to find until you get your bearings in the maze of busy alleys. we ate in the riad on our first evening too and again this was a lovely meal with our hosts explaining the traditional fare and ensuring we were happy. they took us out the next day to guide us how to get around to and from the main square again a wonderful service. it is more difficult in the dark so make sure you happy with your route and stick to it it works. the courtyard is beautiful with a trickling fountain and the rooftop terrace is the icing on the cake. Marrakesh is a busy noisy city and this riad is a oasis of cleanliness and peace only 10 mins walk away. it really is a beautiful experience staying at this riad in the centre of the medina. I cant imagine anyone being disappointed if they stay here,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisaW857
Riad Houdou,Federica V wrote a review Mar 2015,50,A great family holiday!,We spent 4 terrific days in Riad Houdou: from the moment we arrived at the airport till we left Dider Eric and their staff took great care of us!  Our family suite was super nice very spacious clean and with a great attention to details the way it was furnished and prepared. After the pick up Eric walked us until the main square of Marrakech to show us the way and give us some tips about what to visit how to get there and where to eat.  The staff is very kind and we enjoyed every morning a different delicious traditional breakfast. The first night we stayed for dinner as well and we really liked it; also the kids menue was great and our children appreciated it a lot. Didier organised for us an excursion in the desert and everything was just perfect: the guide was very available and drove very safe. There is the possibility to have the Hamman and other spa treatments which can be taken either in the room or the beautiful and relaxing terrace where we had some nice aperitifs watching the sunset!  If we go back to Marrakech we will definitely stay to Riad Houdou again!,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FedericaV43
Riad Houdou,Henderson111 wrote a review Feb 2015,50,Amazing Riad!,My husband and I stayed in this riad a couple of weeks ago and loved it! I found it difficult to choose one from the huge choice available but I am so pleased we chose Riad Houdou. It really couldn't have been better. The location is fantastic just a short walk from the main square and the souks and somehow offers such a tranquil and peaceful break when just a short walk away is craziness! The owners Erik and Didier are fantastic. So so so helpful they even walked us to the main square when we arrived pointing out landmarks on the way so that we could find our way back! They recommended and booked a hammam a trip to the desert and a couple of lovely restaurants for us and were always on hand to give advice and help us decide what to do. The Riad itself is gorgeous. Spotlessly clean and comfortable. The food is lovely the staff are so so kind and helpful. It's just awesome and I definitely recommend this riad to anyone going to Marrakech.,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Farnham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Henderson111
Riad Houdou,FoodieTravelerNYC wrote a review Feb 2015,50,Amazing Riad with Fantastic Food and Hospitality!,Our family of four (incl. very active and hungry 3yo twins) had the most wonderful 3-night stay at Riad Houdou. We are so happy that we believed the hype because everything was perfect; Eric and Didier are the friendliest most helpful hosts Aziz was so warm and gentle (our kids just loved him!) and oh my goodness the amazing Rajaa and the ladies that made the most delicious Moroccan food we had ever had... When we travel we avoid eating at the hotel at all costs because that's not what traveling is about right? Well that is simply not the case at Riad Houdou because you will have the best food at the riad. Authentic home-cooked Moroccan cuisine in a cozy atmosphere. We loved sharing the dinner table with Eric and Didier and to my vegetarian husband's delight the fact that Didier is also vegetarian guaranteed that his version of the meal was equally flavorful and tasty. We honestly couldn't have asked for a better stay in Marrakech and will wholeheartedly recommend Riad Houdou to all our friends and family that will be visiting Marrakech. We also hope to return for the Atlas Mountains and when we do we know where we'd be staying! The kids are already asking to go back :) Thank you so much!,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FoodieTravelerNYC
Riad Houdou,226Helen wrote a review Jan 2015,50,Wonderful Peaceful Riad,We spent five nights at Riad Houdou over new year and couldn't have wished for a nicer place to stay. Eric and Didier are brilliant hosts and the riad feels like a home from home. It's also wonderfully peaceful in the middle of the busy Medina. The breakfasts are delicious as are the dinners. Make sure you eat there at least one night! The trip into the mountains which Didier and Eric arranged for us was one of our favourite days of the holiday. We can't recommend it enough as a place to stay and will definitely be coming back again!,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/226Helen
Riad Houdou,ychoi12 wrote a review Dec 2014,50,A Welcome Respite in a Busy City,"My boyfriend and I stayed at this Riad last week and we cannot tell you how lovely the experience was.    I highly recommend requesting a pick up from the airport - their driver Ammen will be waiting for you and will provide a lovely description of the city if you ask for it. He'll drive you as far as he can go then a nice gentleman with a cart will walk your bags to the Riad which is in the heart of the Medina. You'll be welcomed by a staff member (in our case it was the owners themselves Eric and Didier) and offered a beverage. I recommend the mint tea obviously.    From there you will be taken to your room and given a map of the city at which point you'll realize that yes what you read in the reviews is right. You really ARE in the heart of the Medina!    Aziz a sweet gentleman who is the hotel manager walked us to the main square making sure to stop every few minutes to give us landmarks and show us how to not get lost. And it worked we actually found it really hard to get lost after this and we purposely tried a few times. We always knew ""oh that's the way to the square.""    These are just a few examples of how thoughtful and lovely this Riad is. It's clean it's quiet it's beautiful it's completely worth it.    Some more recommendations - I know you'll want to explore the city but you can't beat the dinner you'll have at the Riad which was better than anything we had in a restaurant. Raja is a real master chef. Ask for the lamb special it takes 5-6 hours and you'll be given a tour of the ovens which doubles as the water heater for two hammams. Definitely take the Imlil day tour. You'll be driven by Ammen taken into the mountains on mules by Hassan and Hamid Berber locals and given the most amazing lunch by their families on top of a mountain. It was awe inspiring!    In all it was the perfect trip to Marrakesh and I say you should stop thinking and book it!",Date of stay: December 2014,,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ychoi12
Riad Houdou,Hopalongtravel wrote a review Dec 2014,40,Wonderful Small Hotel in the Medina,This hotel is owned by two French men: Didier and Erik who are probably the nicest hoteliers you could ever meet. The Medina is a crazy place but the Houdou is one of the oasis' in it. The first day Didier walked us over to Place Jemaa El Fna (the square) to show us where to change money which was over the top nice. We had a twin bed room and there were rose petals on the bed and throughout the room! Everything was impeccably decorated: the guest rooms the common areas you could tell they thought out everything. Breakfast was included which was very good and we had dinner one night which was fabulous. The staff at this riad are nice and very accommodating. I liked a cape that Didier was wearing and his male staffer offered to buy me one! How nice could you be? Didier and Erik answered all of our questions and were perfect hosts. I would definitely stay there again. My only suggestion/comment was that the beds in our room were a little hard for our taste.,Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"San Diego, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hopalongtravel

Didier did everything possible to make our first visit to Marrakech a very pleasant one. His advice for what to do was perfect for us as a couple with a small child (4). He even found the time to walk us to the main square ( so that we would have a chance of finding our way back ) a 10 minutes walk.

Riad Houdou,Gavin H wrote a review Dec 2014,50,Probably the Best Riad in Marrakech.,Where do i start the arranged driver to collect us from the Airport the porter to then collect our bags and deliver us to the Riad the warm welcome from Eric. The most beautiful oasis once over the threshold. The beautiful rooms the luxury bathrooms the amazing food the fresh fruit the superb mojitos... the list is endless i could not fault this Riad everything was just perfect Eric arranged for transport and mule riding up in the atlas mountains he arranged the massage the scrub down in the Hammam which is just wonderful addition to this already amazing Riad. Th level of service that Eric and diddi provided was 1st class i would actually suggest that some of the worlds top hotel chains send their managers here to learn what service really means as i can honestly say it was the best service i have ever encountered any where around the world.

Their knowledge about the country and the city is a treasure and they are always around to help you with everything like finding the right way the shop you are searching for or trips in the surrounding.  The rooms are perfectly clean and lovely furnished in every detail.  The breakfast is delicious but whats the best (in my eyes) is the tasty dinner in the evening cooked from the lovely cook Rajaa and served from the so nice and helpfull Raja and Azis.

Riad Houdou,ClarkH81 wrote a review Nov 2014,50,A Wonderful Week at Riad Houdou!,Where do I even begin?! I just returned from a fabulous week in Marrakesh and had the pleasure of spending it at the Riad Houdou. The Riad sits down a little unobtrusive alley not too far from the Souks and the Jemaa el Fnaa but far enough that it is a quite peaceful respite from the madness that can be Marrakesh.    The Riad is centered around a magical courtyard with 4 citrus trees flowering plants fountains fresh cut roses and beautiful mosaic tile work. Two adorable turtles roam the courtyard as well as the Parisian ex-patriot cat Sophie. It was here that every morning I enjoyed a delicious breakfast of french coffee crepes omelets to die for home made Greek yogurt orange blossom honey and fruit all home made and served by the lovely girls who cook the meals and take care of the Riad.    Eric & Didier are the French ex-pats who own the Riad and you can tell love what they do. They both greeted us upon arrival and were always around to answer any and all questions yet were happy to let us do our own touring and exploring. They were both delightful and made me feel at home right away. They are very knowledgeable about Marrakesh and were always happy to recommend whatever it was we were looking for. I felt like we were staying with good friends right from the start. They were always there to dine with their guests in the evening and due to poor planning on my part I was always out and about in the city and never had the chance to share dinner with them. Although if breakfast is any indication I'm sure the food is phenomenal as well as the company. And of course both Eric & Didier have wonderful French style.    The Riad is so pretty and charming and SPOTLESSLY clean. I walked around the tiled floors of my room barefoot and was always amazed that my feet remained totally clean. Anyone with hardwood or tile floors knows that usually isn't the case I swear they must sweep mop and scrub daily to keep the floors so pristine clean.    The bathroom and bedroom were larger than I expected with very high ceilings air conditioning pops of color most importantly and very very quite.

Riad Houdou,salamander343 wrote a review Oct 2014,50,An oasis,Oasis seems an overused way to describe anything lush and vibrant in Morocco and yet it's the word that springs to mind for me to describe the Riad Houdou. With its 4 trees and gently trickling fountain in the courtyard the public space of the riad is cool and quiet and pretty and extremely pleasant. I stayed in the Fez room and can report that the private space also provided calm and comfort.    I stayed at the Riad Houdou for two nights at the end of an organized tour of Morocco and was getting tired of restaurant food. Being able to eat at the riad in the company of other guests as well as Didier and Eric was a bonus. The food was wonderful and the set up worked perfectly for someone like me who likes to have a good chat over supper.    Finally the location of the riad is excellent. It truly is close to Jemaa el Fna not to mention the souks and the big medersa. And Didier and Eric have worked out a very good system for helping their guests navigate to and from the riad. The system involves a little map and having landmarks pointed out as you're being walked to the square.    It's that personal attention and attention to detail that really put the Riad Houdou into the accommodation hall of fame for me. I would go back in a heartbeat.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Vancouver, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/salamander343

They quickly responded that they could accommodate me. It was never an issue. Aziz met us at the Taxi stall and walked us in. It was a sanctuary from the Marrakech streets. The Riad is very beautiful with traditional tile-work and a lovely fountain in the center of the court-yard.There is also a lovely green tiled refresher pool off the side of the main room. Everything is beautiful and elegant. I love color and texture and I was constantly noticing something new like the massive beautiful old doors or the 17th century lanterns. I especially liked the Art Deco lantern in the office. I also delighted in the library and the Hamsa wall in the lounge. The cook Rajaa is a gem. Her meals were always a delight and beautifully plated. Aziz seemed to anticipate my needswithout fawning. He is also a wonderful dancer.

But the memorable experience would not be all possible without the warm hospitality of Didier Eric and the staff....from the airport pickup mint tea and homemade cookies upon arrival the first taste of the delicious tangine Eric guiding us to the medina the following morning the hammam massage  coordinating a day trip for us and the delicious breakfast every morning especially the crepes......in other words catering to our every need.

Riad Houdou,Thysia P wrote a review Oct 2014,50,An amazing experience and stay!,Raid Houdou was by far our most favourite Riad during our 2 weeks backpacking trip in Morocco. Didier and Eric made us feel at home immediately. The Riad was well looked after clean and was very well decorated. With all the help from the staff we loved the Riad a lot and it was nice to come 'home' after a busy and hectic day in the city. The Riad is located in a perfect place of the city. When you are in the Riad you don't feel like you are in a big city. It is actually really quiet which is rare for the city of Marrakech. Eric showed us around in the city on arrival which was great as it is easy to get lost in the small streets of this city when you don't know the way.    In the evening Didier and Eric organised great dinners with local and staff entertainment. It was an amazing experience to explore the Moroccan culture even more. The room was great and had great facilities! The food was perfect and breakfast was different every day. Especially the home made yoghurt was delicious!  There was so much enthusiasm and happiness from Didier Eric and staff that we will never forget! If you want to explore the city and take time to relax in a typical Moroccan culture Riad Houdou is the place to be.    Didier & Eric - we loved our stay in Riad Houdou even it is nearly 1 year ago we would love to come back again. We wish you both all the best for the future. Hope the cats are doing well and your staff is still enjoying dancing around the dinner table!

Being able to eat at the riad in the company of other guests as well as Didier and Eric was a bonus. The food was wonderful and the set up worked perfectly for someone like me who likes to have a good chat over supper.    Finally the location of the riad is excellent. It truly is close to Jemaa el Fna not to mention the souks and the big medersa. And Didier and Eric have worked out a very good system for helping their guests navigate to and from the riad. The system involves a little map and having landmarks pointed out as you're being walked to the square.    It's that personal attention and attention to detail that really put the Riad Houdou into the accommodation hall of fame for me. I would go back in a heartbeat.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Vancouver, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/salamander343
Riad Houdou,Riverstyx wrote a review Oct 2014,50,Dider and Eric were aware of my nut allergy and totally took care of me.,We originally emailed them telling them about my allergy to all nuts. They quickly responded that they could accommodate me. It was never an issue. Aziz met us at the Taxi stall and walked us in. It was a sanctuary from the Marrakech streets. The Riad is very beautiful with traditional tile-work and a lovely fountain in the center of the court-yard.There is also a lovely green tiled refresher pool off the side of the main room. Everything is beautiful and elegant. I love color and texture and I was constantly noticing something new like the massive beautiful old doors or the 17th century lanterns. I especially liked the Art Deco lantern in the office. I also delighted in the library and the Hamsa wall in the lounge. The cook Rajaa is a gem. Her meals were always a delight and beautifully plated. Aziz seemed to anticipate my needswithout fawning. He is also a wonderful dancer. Erick and Dider were perfect host and I loved when we all sat down to dinner and enjoyed each other's company. The staff was excellent. I would definitely return.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,San Francisco,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Riverstyx

Riad Houdou,AussieBonz wrote a review Oct 2014,50,Lovely quiet place to stay,We chose this riad based on other Tripadvisor comments and it did not disappoint. It is in the medina a short walk from most main attractions but is down an alley and very quiet. It is truly an oasis of serenity in the middle of the chaos of the narrow bustling streets of the medina. Eric and Didier the owners are very kind and helpful. The riad is beautifully decorated clean and comfortable. Breakfast is included and was top quality. The room price is very reasonable too. The rooms are small but in the medina everything is like that. I would highly recommend this riad to stay.,Date of stay: October 2014,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AussieBonz
Riad Houdou,Sarami2000 wrote a review Oct 2014,50,The best Riad in Morocco!,It was our first visit in Morocco. Riad Houdou was the best choice we made in Marrakesh. Not only was the Riad situated in the old medina but was also convenient to the major tourist attractions.  The Riad was tastefully decorated clean and had a warm feeling of home.    But the memorable experience would not be all possible without the warm hospitality of Didier Eric and the staff....from the airport pickup mint tea and homemade cookies upon arrival the first taste of the delicious tangine Eric guiding us to the medina the following morning the hammam massage  coordinating a day trip for us and the delicious breakfast every morning especially the crepes......in other words catering to our every need.    We highly recommend this Riad to anyone out there who has second thoughts.

Riad Houdou,Thysia P wrote a review Oct 2014,50,An amazing experience and stay!,Raid Houdou was by far our most favourite Riad during our 2 weeks backpacking trip in Morocco. Didier and Eric made us feel at home immediately. The Riad was well looked after clean and was very well decorated. With all the help from the staff we loved the Riad a lot and it was nice to come 'home' after a busy and hectic day in the city. The Riad is located in a perfect place of the city. When you are in the Riad you don't feel like you are in a big city. It is actually really quiet which is rare for the city of Marrakech. Eric showed us around in the city on arrival which was great as it is easy to get lost in the small streets of this city when you don't know the way.    In the evening Didier and Eric organised great dinners with local and staff entertainment. It was an amazing experience to explore the Moroccan culture even more. The room was great and had great facilities! The food was perfect and breakfast was different every day. Especially the home made yoghurt was delicious!  There was so much enthusiasm and happiness from Didier Eric and staff that we will never forget! If you want to explore the city and take time to relax in a typical Moroccan culture Riad Houdou is the place to be.    Didier & Eric - we loved our stay in Riad Houdou even it is nearly 1 year ago we would love to come back again. We wish you both all the best for the future. Hope the cats are doing well and your staff is still enjoying dancing around the dinner table!

I had a lot of questions prior to our arrival and all were answered in the nicest and most helpful way. It was our first introduction to Marocco and really great: Beautiful Riad with a lot of eye for detail.  The teapot room we had was very comfortable with a beautiful bathroom.  And then the food......twice we had dinner in the Riad and it was probably the best I had during our three week holiday. Also breakfast was excellent.

Riad Houdou,Rmkoch wrote a review Aug 2014,50,Excelent Riad in the middle of the medina,We stayed in Riad Houdou for a few nights in July. The Riad is located in the middle of the Medina (old town) although it's not hard to get there (it's very close to place Moukef where taxis can still stop). They have a pick up service to and from the airport which is slightly more expensive than a taxi but worth it.  The riad is small but very well maintained the rooms are well decorated and the place is very quiet on a side street which separates it from the bustle of some of the streets in the medina. The atmosfere is very relaxed and homely.  The staff is excelent very very friendly and efficient and the two french owners (Didier and Eric) are extremelly helpful friendly and attentive.  Breakfast is very good with plenty of choices and dinner is even better (it's not included in the accomodation but it's well worth the price I highly recommend it).  Our room was very nice with a small balcony for ourselves but the downside was the fact that it was on the top floor and therefore very hot during the day (it is air conditioned but Marrakesh is very warm in the summer months).  I highly recommend this riad as it has excelent value for money the location is great to explore the medina and we felt extremelly welcome throughout.,Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Porto, Portugal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rmkoch

I had been looking for the other Riad for some time when I called to the door and the two guys couldn't have been any more helpful. They helped me contact my Riad and let me use their WIFI and gave me a drink.  Without them I would still be looking for my Riad!

Riad Houdou,KirstyHutch wrote a review Jul 2014,50,Amazing - an absolute oasis,I have just returned from a week away in Marrakech and stayed one night at the Riad Houdou.  As many others have said this place is just a dream! The riad itself is impeccable - really clean with lovely decor and is a real oasis from the chaos of the medina. The open air courtyard where we ate and had afternoon tea was so bright and so relaxing at the same time. Our room the Babouche room was really authentic and stylish with a fab private roof terrace. As single female travellers we were really anxious about finding the riad however Didier provided us with directions from the square which made so much sense when we arrived and although we got lost (which was part of the fun experience) the riad is less than 10 mins walking distance from the Djemma el Fna square through open streets and souks (not as scary as I thought!).  The best thing about this Riad has to be the hosts - Didier and Eric - from the second we arrived their friendliness and openess was so lovely and reassured any stresses I had about travelling around Marrakech and the medina. They showed us around the main areas and even took us to the square at night - way beyond what they needed to. My only regret is that I didn't stay here longer..a really handy base for those visiting the city.  We will be back!

Riad Houdou,Anne V wrote a review Jun 2014,50,A welcoming paradise in the heart of the medina,What an incredible experience thanks to Eric and Didier! These passionate hosts will welcome you warmly into their riad and you won't want to leave. Their level of service and hospitality was absolutely wonderful; from walking us into the main square so we get to know our neighbourhood to sitting and chatting over mint tea on the rooftop terrace upon arrival to warm communal dining with the other guests. The riad itself if top-notch - authentic and charming decor with all the creature comforts such as airconditioning lovely bath products and complimentary water and sweets. There's a refreshing plunge-pool for the hotter months and dining under the lemon and lime trees is heavenly at any time of year. Their staff are also exceptional - nothing is ever too much trouble. I also travelled with two coeliacs and they went above and beyond to cater for gluten-free needs (unheard of in the rest of Morocco!). As someone who has been to Morocco 8 times Riad Houdou is the only place I will revisit and bring my family and friends to without a doubt.

Riad Houdou,Rebecca H wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Everything we could have wished for and more!,"We were lucky enough to have had Riad Houdou recommended to us by a friend who had stayed there last year and we were't disappointed!  The decor is gorgeous and Eric & Didier have an eye for detail which results in tasteful eclectic rooms which are a pleasure to be in. One of the highlights of our stay was our Hammam and massage afterwards made all the more pleasurable as we didn't have to leave the RIad.    Eric & Didier were perfect hosts and we had a fantastic evening with them and other guests enjoying a beautifully prepared meal showcasing the best of Morrocan cuisine.    It was only a short walk to the main square and once we were shown the way by Didier we found it easy to navigate our way through the Medina. Eric and Didier are the ""Go To"" for local info and anything you want to know from where to eat what to pay and how much things should cost. This  was invaluable.    The staff are great so friendly and helpful which really makes a difference and the cook makes all her own homemade preserves etc which we loved especially the cherry jam delicious!

Riad Houdou,littlepistol wrote a review Jun 2014,40,"Great riad, hard to find",Riad Houdou was our base of operations during a four day trip to Marrakech. The rooms are a bit smaller than some of the other riads we stayed in but the pool and fruit trees in the courtyard add to the beautiful setting. Since we had an upstairs room we were able to leave the doors open while we lounged around. I would recommend that guests take the hotel up on their offer to pick them up from the square as the hotel seemed impossible to find. We were three seasoned travelers with great senses of direction and we had a hard time locating the riad especially at night. But I would not let that deter me from staying here again.,Date of stay: December 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/littlepistol

Eric and Didier were warm and welcoming (as was all the staff) and upon arrival it is clear they have decorated the place well and were great hosts. The breakfast is kinda light by western standards (but as was every other b&b we stayed in Marocco--so I can't knock them for that) and occasionally there would be a passing unfortunate smell of the riad's former life as a stable but every Riad in Marrakech has that problem in our experience. We'd stay here again and will suggest it to our friends--not least because it is easy to reach from Place Moukef. Next time we'd eat out though as it's a better value to do so than eating at the Riad.,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BenjaminB591
Riad Houdou,Catherine Maria J wrote a review May 2014,50,A riad you will surely rave about!,When I was planning for our holiday in Marrakech the choice of riads was so plentiful it was quite hard to actually decide which would be the perfect place to stay. The reviews however helped me choose Riad Houdou as each and everyone of them were excellent. It was indeed the right choice for us as the minute you stepped in their Riad our two hosts Didier and Eric did everything they could to make sure our stay would be a memorable one. After a welcoming cup of mint tea Eric took us to the famous Djemma El- Fna main square so we could wander around and find our way back easily to the riad. He took the time to explain what to do where to go what to avoid etc.  On the way back we were given a tour of the riad shown to our room and could feel we were made welcome in their realm. The staff was helpful smiling and attentive to your every need. A nice breakfast was served every morning with homemade jams and delicious yogurts. We joined in their dinners every night and were served a variety of dishes which had no comparison to the daily passable lunches we had elsewhere in Marrakech or in the desert. Attention to details authentic food and convivial diners made our evenings very pleasant indeed. Didier Eric and his staff will surely enthuse you as much as they enthused us!

Riad Houdou,Steven v wrote a review May 2014,50,Relax Riad in City Center,This Riad has two wonderful owners. Originally from France the owners now live and work in Marrakesch. They are very familiar with the culture and the people which is great for visiting tourists who can take full advantage of their local knowledge.  Upon arrival the owners suggest you take a tour with them through the Medinas so that they can show you some key waypoints. This is very helpful because unlike most cities in Europe and North America the inner city streets of Marrakesch just seem to weave in and out of random places.  The Riad itself is a jewel within the busy city. Entering the Riad you literally leave the hustle and bustle of everything behind you. It has been designed and restored with special touches from the owners making it a comfy and relaxing place.  From the roof terrace you overlook the city and even see the Atlas mountains in the distance. It is a nice place to soak up sun or even have breakfast.  If you want to stay in a place that has a good character and charm this is certainly a recommended Riad.,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/13stevenv

Didier and Eric were incredibly welcoming and made us feel totally at home. The rest of the staff were so helpful and happy and the general atmosphere was perfect. I really couldn't think of any way they could improve the service or Riad! The breakfasts were lovely and the meal we had in the Riad was the best we had in Marrakech and eating with Eric and Didier and the other guests was a really good start to our trip. We went on the mule trip excursion arranged by the Riad and would thoroughly recommend that as well - the guide was was great as were his family (we ate in his house in the Berber village of Mazek).

Riad Houdou,bev a wrote a review May 2014,50,The Perfect Riad in Marrakech,I don't usually leave reviews but just felt that as this was so perfect I needed to. You can read the wonderful reviews and see the amazing photos on the internet that have been left by other guests but until you actually stay in this amazing Riad you can't fully appreciate the attention to detail and amazing surroundings you are actually in. The Riad is an absolute credit to Didier and Eric as soon as you walk in the reception you can see and appreciate all the hard work they have put in it over the last couple of years and attention to detail their interior design skills are second to none. You will struggle to find food as good (Rajaa the Cook could show Gordan Ramsay and Nigella Lawson a thing or two) check out her amazing homemade yoghurt for breakfast - delicious. My only regret is not staying for longer and eating more in the Riad so will definitely be back. As someone else has mentioned in their review it really is home from home. The location is ideal as it is in the middle of where the local people live so as you walk the 5 minutes to the square you can take in the authentic everyday life in the medina which adds to the experience. Nothing is too much trouble all the staff are wonderfully helpful and kind and I would like to take this opportunity to say a big thank you to Didier and Eric for our amazing stay.,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/580beva

On arriving we were greeted with mint tea and pastries and a welcoming chat about our stay. Eric showed us the way to the square to ensure we did not get lost. I would recommend eating in on the first night the food was the best we had and it saved wandering around looking for somewhere to eat. We ate with the other guests and Didier and Eric joined us it was a wonderful evening.  We took a daytrip towards the mountains and walked by the waterfalls it does get very busy particularly at the weekend.  We had a hammam at the riad this was the most extraordinary experience ever but in a good way. I shall say no more to spoil it for you.

We read something about the location not being top but we have to disagree: just after 1 minute walking in a quiet but safe alley and you are right in the middle of the action and 10 minutes away to Djeema el Fna. The internal courtyard is wonderful and we spent quite some time there planning our activities and transports. We got the smallest room which was ok but I can tell that the other rooms were ranging from great to wonderful. There is a nice terrace and a small hammam. The staff is fabolous from Aziz who helped us with everything and also bargained for us for a luggage transfer always with a smile on to the owners Eric and Didier who are always available.

Oh to be able to cook like that - perhaps I should go back to do the cookery course they offer. The atmosphere in the Riad is very relaxed but the staff are ready to help at all times. The excursion recommended by Didier was superb we went to Amizmiz in the foothills of the Atlas and spent the day walking the beautiful countryside between traditional Berbere villages stopping off at our guide's house for Mint Tea and meeting his family lunch followed in another village - a trip not to be missed.

We had booked dinner on our first night so we could eat without getting lost and it was so good that apart from one very average and expensive dinner at a Jemaa el Fna kiosk ( you have to do it once) we ate at "" Rajaas"" every evening. Having dinner with Didier and Eric is a highlight  so sociable and informative you soon feel like you are staying with old friends not Hoteliers.  The riad is spotlessly clean and well tended and any minor problem is immediately attended to. On the way back to the airport my wife was already saying Marrakech is the perfect place for some February sun and when can we see Riad Houdou again. You cannot have a better recommendation. We missed out on the Houdou Cocktail so will be back soon.

Riad Houdou,saeagle wrote a review Feb 2014,50,Truely Exceptional,It is very difficult to say anymore than what has been said previously.    We chose to visit Marrakech for our anniversary and came across Riad Houdou. I bombarded Didier with emails and he was always quick to reply. I am sure that he is now glad we have been as he can have some piece and quiet.    We arranged a taxi from the airport which was waiting for us as we came through the arrivals. This was a great start as the driver was very informative and showed us some of the sites on the way. It was a bit nerve racking when we stopped in the medina and our suitcase was unloaded and put in a trolley of some random person. We really should not have worried as the roads were simply too narrow for the van and we were on our next adventure to find the riad. We follwed the gentleman with our bags through the hustle of the streets turning off onto a quite road past the public hamman. We were then introduced to the serentinty of the riad and our hosts for the weekend Didier and Eric.    We had requested dinner on our first night as we were a late arrival. Whilst dinner is usually around 8/8:30 Didier Eric and the other guests had waited for us. We had a quick cocktail with everyone and then made our way to dinner. WOW. I thought i could make a decent tagine; the meal was simply delicious. From Starter to dessert. The advantage of eating at the Riad is that you can have 2nds. We actually ate here twice (and myself once more when my wife wasn't feeling great). It was the best food we had in Marrakech. The breakfast was great and was a good way to start the day. There was always something different with the breakfast and you could ask for eggs if you wanted.    The roof itself was very well designed and plenty big enough for 4 nights. there had obviously been a lot of thought put into the design and it showed. The Riad itself is again beautiful and it is apparent that Didier and eric take a lot of pride in what they do. the staff are also great and even though they don't speak a lot of English will always try and have some fun with you.    The Riad was a perfect getaway from the square. The peace and quiet (and pure lazyness) was only interupted by the need for cocktails at 7:30 before dinner. It was about a 10/15 minute walk to the square which was enough time to take in the hustle before fighting the real salesman in the market.    We loved our time at the Riad. I very seldom give 5 stars but this place was totally deserving. Perhaps my only critiscm was that the pillows were quite hard but that is really just me being picky and trying to find at least one fault.    We are already looking when we can come back. Keep up the great work.,Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saeagle
Riad Houdou,Nicola S wrote a review Feb 2014,50,Home away from home,Didier and Eric of Riad Houdou are by far the best hosts I’ve experienced. I’ve travelled to Tunisia and Egypt and stayed in some lovely guest houses but Riad Houdou really felt like you were coming to stay with old friends.    The chilled and relaxed environment created just a few steps from the hustle and bustle of El Moukef souk was just what we were looking for. No request was too much hassle for Didier and Eric and his wonderful staff and everything was handled swiftly and always with a smile. This included a first trip to Jemaa el Fna to get our bearings advice for the souks organising the Hammam peelings and activities for the day.    We stayed in the Babouches themed room with its own private terrace. I’m so glad we booked this room as sitting there each morning having our breakfast in the sun was such a treat and so private too! The setup of the rooms in the Riad and also the discretion of the other guests meant that you really didn’t feel you were intruding on anyone and they weren’t intruding on you.    One thing I regret….only enjoying one evening meal in the Riad. The three course meal was better than the other meals we ate in the Medina and these did come with good recommendations by Didier and Eric. But their company at dinner and the other guests and the service from their lovely staff really did make the meal special.    It was only 4 days but it was perfect! I’m already looking forward to returning to Marrakech as it’s an amazing and easy place to check out the winter sun provided the heat needed and the locals and their banter was really good fun. But we didn’t even scratch the surface of Marrakech and I wouldn’t want to stay anywhere else. I’ve found my home away from home.

Riad Houdou,Monica H wrote a review Feb 2014,50,Very nice Riad in the center of the Medina,We spent 3 days at Riad Houdou and found the hospitality of Eric & Didier exceptional! We got good information in advance by mail and after our arrival Eric went with us to show the way to and from Jemaa el Fnaa. We found Riad Houdou very well situated in the historical part of the medina and it was just an advantage not to be too close to Jemaa el Fna which we did not find very interesting at all actually!  At Riad Houdou you feel more like in a family than in a hotel which can be very nice and we remember very well the nice evening with dinner and traditional music together with Eric Didier and the other guests!

Riad Houdou,kmoore61 wrote a review Feb 2014,50,'Joie de Vivre',To Eric Didier and all the staff at Riad Houdou we cannot thank you all enough. From the moment we made our reservation the customer service was second to none. Whatever our requests – nothing was too much trouble.  As other guests have said – the Riad is beautiful and they have thought of all guests’ needs. The food is fabulous and a wonderful way to socialise and meet other guests. Drinks are plentiful and rather inexpensive – (15euro) for a lovely bottle of Moroccan red.  We will miss our new friends and have come away with lifelong memories from Marrakech – you couldn’t ask for anything more.

Starting from the reservations we received a welcome email instructions to the riad and options for new years celebrations. Upon arrival our room was perfectly decorated clean and fragrant. Didier even went so far as to walk with us to the main square in order to show us the route so we wouldn't get lost. When we asked about visiting a hamam Didier suggested that one of the hotel staff accompany our journey to a local spot- and we had a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

Didier Eric and the rest of the team were fantastic hosts we were met at the airport on arrival and on our first morning given a guided tour to show us the way to the main square as well as some tips on where to eat and visit. The breakfasts were delicious and we also enjoyed an evening meal in the Riad on two occasions.    Didier and Eric have obviously put a lot of thought into decorating the Riad and it shows. The small quiet courtyard is especially beautiful with orange and lemon trees and a fountain it was a very relaxing place to eat breakfast or enjoy some mint tea. We stayed in both the Spice Suite and Teapot room during our stay and would recommend either.

Riad Houdou,Timothy O wrote a review Dec 2013,50,A great birthday treat,I took my wife to Marrakech for her 30th birthday and it was the first time in the city for the both of us. It was simply the most ideal place to stay and at the risk of repeating what many others have already said an oasis in the chaos. We were picked up from the airport and arrived at the Riad to be met by Didier who with the help of his enthusiastic team laid on a homemade Moroccan feast. Our room was at the top of the Riad with views over the rooftops and our own balcony where we had breakfast every morning to the sound of the streets below.  On the first morning Eric took us to the main square pointing out their favourite shops and providing some vital tips on handling the locals along the way.  After a tiring day of navigating the streets and haggling with the wily shopkeepers it is a perfect retreat for a nightcap or simply to collapse into the very comfy beds. Eric and Didier are fantastic hosts and a font of local knowledge.

Riad Houdou,Sarah C wrote a review Dec 2013,50,What wonderful hospitality!,I came to Marrakech with some friends and we were delighted with the welcome at Riad Houdou especially since our flight was delayed and we didn't get there until about 11pm. Our room was charming beautifully furnished with local accessories we were very pleased. The next morning Eric took us on a trip to Place Jmaa el Fna to orient us in the maze that is the medina. I believe this is a tradition at the Riad without which we would have instantly been lost but with Eric's guidance we began to feel we knew you way around - although as Eric said you will probably get lost anyway which is true.  Eric Didier Aziz Rajaa and all the staff at the Riad were our friends while we were there and nothing seemed too much trouble for them. Breakfast and dinner were excellent and on the occasion when we ate elsewhere we were even escorted to the restaurant.  All of the reception rooms are beautiful with added local features - watch out for the little tortoises!  I went on from Marrakech to spend some time in the High Atlas mountains but chose to return to spend a night at Riad Houdou on my way home - I could have gone directly to the airport but opted for an extra night at Riad Houdou as a treat. After 5 weeks in the mountains and a busy last day in the medina it was so good to come back to the Riad for a quiet dinner (with excellent local menu) and interesting conversation with Eric and Didier.  I cannot speak too highly of the care and hospitality received - I love Riad Houdou and everyone there and hope to return before too long.,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Leamington Spa, UK",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/732sarahc732
Riad Houdou,Parrotlink wrote a review Dec 2013,50,An oasis amidst the chaos,Just come back from 5 nights at the Riad Houdou our first visit to Marrakesh and it was wonderful. The location was ideal for the Medina and close to the square. The staff were delightful and extreemely helpful and polite. The owners Didier and Eric were gratious hosts nothing was too much trouble and they went out of their way to make us feel welcome and at home. There were fresh roses in our room and rose petal decorations everywhere.  The Riad is very tastefully appointed and decorated.  We ate at the Riad every night as the food was so good and varied. We were entertained by a local street musician one evening which was great fun he got all the guests dancing and singing along to the local tempo.  The location was perfect for everything and although our initial impression of the Medina area left us wondering how we were going to manage we soon realised that for 2 women travelling alone there was nothing to worry about. Yes we got hassled for money to guide us but no more so than any other tourists did.  I would highly recommend the Riad Houdou and shall certainly be recommending it to our friends and will definately stay there again on our next trip to Marrakesh. 10 out of 10 in all aspects of our stay.

Owners Didier and Eric showed great hospitality and truly cared about the guests' needs and had an answer to each question or problem. The staff were also great and enthusiastic and I truly felt like being at home in this wonderful small Riad. The room (Tagine) was nicely furnished and I especially liked the bathroom with the wonderful shower ""cabinet"". Common areas were comfortable too and the lemon and orange trees downstairs were marvellous. As a solo traveller it was nice to have a chat every now and then with the other guests and the owners too.    Enjoyed the dinner too certainly one of my top eating experiences in Morocco. Breakfasts were top level too with freshly squeezed orange juice & home made stuff (even though I rarely eat breakfast at home here I enjoyed eating it too).    Location is central but quiet enough Djemaa el Fna square is located about 10mins away and the owners are willing to show you the way so that you won't get lost in the maze of the Medina.

The Riad is beautiful a real calm oasis in the hustle and bustle of the Medina and you are made to feel so welcome by all the staff that work at the Riad. Especially thoughtful is the guided tour Didier took us on the first day so we knew our way to and from Jammaa el Fna as it is easy to loose your bearings. The supper we shared on the first night with the other guests strongly recommended the food is amazing and Eric & Didier obviously enjoy sharing their beautiful home with their guests.

The very first day Didier showed us the way to Jammaa el Fna square and he adviced us on some key landmarks and locations to bet back to the hotel easily (it's a bit tricky at the beginning as all streets are narrow and look like the same).    Breakfasts were awesome and gave us strength for a hard day walking and sightseeing...dinners at the riad were also special. We have dinner with the rest of guests sharing experiences and stories and dancing and listening to live berber music..

The Riad is few minutes walk from the Medina it has been recently renovated and sports great decor throughout thanks to the good taste of the new owners Didier and Eric.  Each room is furnished according to a theme (we stayed in the ""teiere"") which adds a lot of character and uniqueness to the place. We had dinner at the Riad twice: the food was great the service and preparation impeccable.  On our last night since it was my wife B'Day Didier and Eric organized for a musician to play during the evening took care of arranging a surprise cake on my behalf and were so nice to buy her a present. Really unexpected thoughtful and super appreciated touch.  Didier and Eric are by far the best hosts we came across in 20 years of travelling across the world. They are super nice friendly and will take care of you and any need you might have as if it were their only mission in life.

Riad Houdou,Vaughan T wrote a review Aug 2013,50,Calm in the City,Service was super at this delightful riad. Even before we arrived the owners had tracked our plane realised that it had been diverted to Agadir because of a sandstorm and rearranged the lovely evening meal to account for our late arrival. And the following day we were escorted to the main square so that we could find our bearings in this complicated city.    The hotel was a true respite from the hubbub and when we visited in August the heat of the medina. As the temperature rose we would return to the hotel to relax and read around the pool ready for the evening's outing.    The rooms and the courtyard were beautifully decorated more a home than a hotel. Breakfast was lovely with home-cooked Moroccan food.

Riad Houdou,meech76 wrote a review Aug 2013,50,A refreshing change.,We visited after a friend recommended us for my boyfriends 50th. We arrived early in the morning with a warm welcome and unexpected gorgeous breakfast. After we went straight for a nap! On awakening we were guided to the square also unexpected. We had splashed out and the room was beautiful we didn't really want to leave it! It was brilliant to be able to head back to the calm and beautiful surroundings when the busy streets became to much for us. There we would re charge before we'd head out again. it was close enough to be able to do this easily.    I had noticed on the website (though it has now changed) that vegetarians were also welcome. As a vegetarian I felt VERY welcome which makes a refreshing change. The meal here was by far the best of my whole trip. (shame it was the first night. Next time I would leave it till the last!) Everyone else also survived with out the chicken! So maybe now it has been taken out of that option...?!    Everyone there and the surroundings made my boyfriends 50th one he'll never forget.

Riad Houdou,608DJC wrote a review Jul 2013,40,An oasis,This a really beautiful place to stay in centre of Marrakech. The streets around are very typically Moroccan - exotic busy etc; and from the outside the Riad Houdou is almost indistinguishable from the houses around.    But inside it is wonderfully peaceful and beautifully designed. We only stayed for one night but immediately wanted to stay longer!    The hosts could not be more welcoming and helpful.

Riad Houdou,Duckbah wrote a review Jul 2013,50,Beautifiul riad and lovely hosts,We stayed with Didier and Eric for the last 2 nights of our visit to Marrakech. We were a group of 4 adults and 3 children and the riad was able to comfortably accommodate us all. We were given a very spacious and beautiful room with a large bed and 2 single beds and the second room with a large bed and 1 single bed. Our hosts made us feel welcome from the moment we stepped into their lovely home with homemade pastries and delicious mint tea. The dinner prepared by their cook was absolutely delicious even my kids cleaned their plates! The location is a bit out of the way but that didn't really bother us. There is a little plunge pool which our kids loved and kept them busy in the summer heat.

The interior design of this small romantic Riad is breathtaking it's heart is Moroccan but there are other influences to be found. All that you see touch and smell within is beautiful and interesting. The warmth love and life experience not to mention hard work that went into the recently completed refurbishment (undertaken by Erik and Didier) is inspiring. The food is superb breakfast hours flexible (we had ours at 11.30 one morning after an enjoyable evening with our hosts) the staff very well chosen beds are extremely comfortable and its well situated inside the Medina.  my wife and I enjoyed Marrakech a great deal and we are already planning our next trip Neither of us would consider staying anywhere else but the Riad Houdou.,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Aljezur, Portugal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlastairK780

The owners and the personnel are warm and kind and take care of your wishes : Didier one of the owner even brought us to a short night tour of Marrakech (the riad is in the heart of the souk few minutes from place Jemal El Fna).  There is no restaurant in the riad but dinners can be arranged on demand ; we had a dinner in the patio with a great tajine lamb.

Riad Houdou,Dave_O_the_World wrote a review Dec 2012,50,Authentic Marrakech...fantastic owners and staff,If you want to eat at McDonalds or shop at Zara then this is not the place for you. If you want to see the areas that look and feel like the Marrakech you've dreamed of then stay at Riad Houdou.  It's located in the Medina down a little side street. About a ten minute walk to the square and very close to the Tanneries and Photography Museum.  It's a beautifully restored Riad and the owners Didier and Eric are fantastic. They help with anything and everything. The food is probably the best I've had in 10 days in Morocco.  Is it easier to find find the Sofitel on a map?...Yes.  Is it easier to stay at a chain hotel you know from before?....Yes  But places like this are worth stepping out of your comfort zone.

Riad Houdou,Christina R wrote a review Nov 2012,50,A little piece of heaven on earth!,For all those that want to feel truly and pleasantly surprised try the Riad Houdou! When the driver dropped us off and we were guided through a maze of little streets of the medina (old city) we were wondering where we had landed! But once the door to the Riad Houdou opens it is as if you enter a piece of heaven on earth. This beautiful Riad has recently been redecorated in a very elegant style but keeping with the traditions of the country. The Riad is held by two very nice French men who have given us a warm friendly welcome and who have been most helpful during our trip (showing us the way through the medina giving us tips changing their menu to suit our desires etc). One night we stayed in and had a lovely dinner in the court yard with other guests and nice traditional music. If you are looking for a friendly clean place with cosy ambiance then try out this Riad!

Riad Houdou,PMT1231 wrote a review Sep 2011,40,Peaceful relaxed riad.,I stayed here with my husband in April. At first I was a bit disappointed because the rooms were not quite as presented in the photos in Trip Advisor. i.e. no curtains or scatter cushions and the low wattage made the rooms appear dulll/dingy when we arrived in the evening.  However once I got used to the fact that a Riad is not like a hotel I enjoyed the difference and the romance of it.  We ate there the first night and the food was great.  Zhara gave us a guided tour to the Square the next day explained where everything was and made sure we knew our way back thorugh the maze of the Medina. She also gave advice on taxi fares etc and helpfully booked tables and a hamman for us at our venues of choice.  The breakfast was great and plentiful.  We did not use the plunge pool because we thought there was something wrong with it but only found out when we were leaving that if we had wanted to use it we should have advised Zhara and she would have put on the filter. It would be good for future guests to be told this at the start of their stay.  The Riad was a good 15/20 minute walk from the Square but handy for walking to pick up a taxi to go to the new town.  I did recommend the Riad to a friend on my return.,Date of stay: April 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PMT1231

Zahra the owner created a very relaxed and friendly ambience and the breakfast of homemade breads and pancakes with fig jam was delicious. Our room was basic but pleasant and the main courtyard is stunning. Riad Houdou is well located close to the souks but we found it quite easy to get totally lost - all part of the fun/experience of Marrakesh.

Zahra who runs it was extremely helpful and friendly but not imposing (even gave us a short tour down to the souk area). She definitely gave her place a very inviting atmosphere. And her kitchen staff although we couldn't speak Arabic with her was so very kind and helpful too. It was nice to be a bit away from the extreme hussle of the centre of the medina but only a short walk to there.

Riad Houdou,BandJWilson wrote a review Apr 2011,40,Nothing was too much trouble,We stayed here as a group of 4 couples in our late 40’s early 50’s. The riad itself was a tranquil and calm haven hidden away behind an unobtrusive front door from the madness of the medina. We arrived in the early evening we had arranged to eat at the riad on our first night; we were given a traditional soup fish tagine fresh fruit salad followed by coffee the meal was served in a tastefully decorated room off the central courtyard it was typically Moroccan and was an enjoyable experience we were also very relieved to find that reasonably priced wine and beer was available in copious amounts if needed. We were met on arrival by the owner Sara/Zara who I can only describe as being extremely helpful and very ‘hands on’ she helped to serve dinner/breakfast showed us around her riad and let us choose which rooms we wanted to stay in. On our first morning she told us about all the different activities that we could do whilst in Marrakech she advised us on what prices to pay for different tourist attractions which came in extremely handy she advised us on local restaurants and told us where we could find eating places that served alcohol. She took us down to the main square and showed us some of the main points of interest nothing was too much trouble. On our second day the general ‘handyman / night porter’ at the riad offered to take us around the tannery which was 5 minutes away. Everyone at the riad was extremely helpful.    If you are looking for a luxury hotel then this riad is not for you; my husband and I have stayed in some really wonderfully luxurious hotels and we probably wouldn’t have stayed here out of choice but we were going away with a group of friends and we fitted in with what everyone else wanted to do. We were pleasantly surprised and it was very good value for money. We were not overly happy with the position of the riad (although some of our party thought it was great) it took about 10/15 minutes to walk back from the main square at times we didn’t feel too safe and slightly uncomfortable in our surroundings one of our party was ‘pick pocketed’ the police said they wouldn’t advise tourist to walk through the back streets after dark having said that if you want to see the ‘real Marrakech’ then this is probably an excellent place to stay just don’t carry any valuables with you.,Date of stay: March 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Worcestershire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BandJWilson

The lovely courtyard has lime and lemon trees and there is a roof garden with lounge chairs and tables a great place for drinks at night to see the stars unimpeded by bright lights of sky scrapers office buildings. And they even have a tiny swimming pool  a wonderful treat to sit in after being out in the hot hot dusty but ever interesting medina. Though we are both seniors with difficulty climbing stairs we were relieved to find that the one staircase to our room was easy to manage because the steps were not too steep and the railings were very good. When the A/C in our room stopped working Habib the friendly and attentive manager upgraded our room to their Suite. He also cooked the best lamb tagine dinner we had in our 2 1/2 weeks in Morocco!.

Riad Houdou,my_honest_opinion1 wrote a review Apr 2010,20,Do NOT go to this riad.,The riad is not conveniently located. Its on the outskirts of the medina and unsafe to return after dark. For the price it charges the quality of service is undelivered. There plenty of riads that offer better facilities for the same price. We ordered dinner which is way overpriced 18 euros pp! and when it came we saw cockroaches scattering from the dish. We were horrified. There's also no TV and absolutely nothing to do in the riad after dark.    But the final let down is the attitude of the owner a french woman who's only incentive is to milk as much money from your pockets as possible. They wanted to charge us 400 euros for a trip to the Sahara when the competitive price across all travel agents and hotels is 70 -100 euros. She was also extremely unreasonable and unsympathetic when we wanted to cancel the rest of the booking as a result of the let down in service. We argued with her for hrs and finally settled to pay for the nights we stayed at the riad instead of the entire booking period (which is only fair as we dont believe in paying for services we are not going to receive) the transaction was complete there and then. But after I returned from holiday I saw that she charged me again! She took money from my account without consulting me and completely violated the agreement we discussed onsite. I'm planning to sue her for this. She is not trustworthy extremely argumentative very narrow minded and only has money rather than customer satisfaction in mind.

Riad Houdou,sunshineaddict666 wrote a review Apr 2010,10,Don't stay here!,Firstly as other people in their reviews have said although we had arranged via email (with written confirmation) to be collected from the airport this didn't happen. We called many times before someone reluctantly agreed to come and get us which meant we waited for over and hour & half at the airport. It was around 38dgs with nothing to do at the airport ... not a good start. The taxi / driver dropped us in the main square and we weren't warned that it was a 30min walk to the Riad with luggage through the tiny streets. Talk about sitting ducks! The Riad is quite complicated to find and road names don't exist so if you do stay take note of how to get around.    The Riad as someone else has also mentioned had a constant smell of sewage. We don't know where it came from and no-one ever explained the source of the smell or made an effort to disguise it. This alone was enough to make our stay unpleasant. The Riad is small and could do with some updating in areas. There were three of us we had booked a 3-bed room but were led to a tiny room with one double bed and one really small seat which was supposed to be the third bed. We complained about the room but were told that the Riad was full so we couldn't move until the following night which we did to a suite which was lovely and twice the size. However they charged us extra for this even though it was their error. Many arguments ensued and none of us were impressed with their attitude. We were then told that this suite was booked for the last night of our stay so had to move yet again!! Appaling given that we had pre-booked well in advance. The plunge pool was tiny and quite dirty with leaves and muck so none of us were brave enough to go in. We sat there one evening and all of us had scarves over our faces to block the smell of sewage so I can't say that Riad was a relaxing oasis of calm.    The female worker was lovely and worked so hard by herself. She was up before dawn to make the breakfast then spent ALL day cooking cleaning & preparing rooms. The breakfast consisted of yoghurt fresh orange juice tea breads & jams fresh pancakes then got a little less with cooked food each day but was really nice. We didn't eat there in the evening so I can't comment on the meals.    I agree that many charges were hidden. We were given a welcome glass of mint tea on arrival but weren't told that it would be charged to the bill (am not being picky but we were on a budget and already charged extra for a bigger room even though we had booked for 3 not 2). We also weren't told despite booking & paying a deposit by credit card that final settlement of the bill had to be in cash no credit cards accepted. No-one wants to walk around with that amount of cash and machines aren't close.    The roof terrace is OK but nothing special and it wasn't easy to get drinks etc during the day. The owner wasn't particularly helpful and even less so after the fiasco with the rooms. We also asked about booking trips but these were much cheaper organised elsewhere.    Marrakech is a fantastic place and don't miss going to Les Bains Spa for a truly pampering relaxing day it was fantastic. However if you want to escape from the hustle & bustle back at your Riad this is not the place to do it. I wouldn't go back there if you paid me.,Date of stay: August 2007,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Beach babe in Brighton,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunshineaddict666

Riad Houdou,Leeds81 wrote a review Feb 2010,30,On a downward spiral,My wife and I stayed here in July 2009 on the final night of our trip to Morocco before we returned to the UK. The riad was not too difficult to find and nearly accessible by taxi (a rarity). It had a pleasant courtyard with lemon and orange trees but a strange smell of effluence that hung around and made you wonder whether:    a - you'd stepped in poo in the medina  b - the drains were blocked up  c - the riad was next to the main sewage outpipe for the medina    The smell wasn't pleasant and it didn't go away. The redeeming quality of the riad was the presence of air conditioning in the rooms (a welcome relief from the scorching heat). The owner told us that she had only recently bought the riad and had moved from France a couple of months before. Now not wishing to sound too critical here but you could really tell she was new to the whole 'hospitality' industry.    On the evening we returned from a meal in the Djemaa and she was sitting up with one of the staff. We asked to put the TV on to 'zone out' for a few minutes to which she replied 'it doesn't work'. We then asked whether we could watch a DVD (as advertised on the website). She said that wasn't possible as she didn't want us to use it and suggested we played a game with tarot cards instead. Not being into the occult we passed on the opportunity.    When we requested a few hot drinks that evening we might as well have requested she attach wings to the riad and fly us to the moon. To say she was reluctant to make them was an understatement.    We left the following day feeling that the Riad had been far more successful under previous ownership (as the other reviews seemed to suggest) and wondered whether she would ever get the hang of hospitality. Unfortunately she seemed all at sea and hadn't yet made the mental jump from viewing us as people in 'her' riad to paying guests that wanted to feel like they weren't disturbing her 'me time'.    Not great. Don't bother going.,Date of stay: July 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Leeds,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leeds81
Riad Houdou,ARTravel82 wrote a review Jan 2010,20,Rip-off,The riad is located in a central yet not too touristy part of the medina. The walking distance to the main square is approx. 20 min. Our room was not nearly as nice as it is presented on the website was not entirely clean and generally had a dated feeling (towels were very old and dirty toilet seat half broken). The breakfast was nothing special (toast eggs jam) but the real reason for my negative review is the level of service. We never felt like we were treated like guets as the only motive of the staff was to extract as much money as possible from us. Whenever we asked for advice or assistance (i.e. taxi restaurant recommendations) we were given ridiculous quotes and we never felt like the staff tried to help us out with local advice (instead they aimed to maximize their proceeds). Given the rich rate we paid for our room I expect and entirely different level of service.... There are hundreds of Riads in Marrakech and I recommend to anybody planning a trip to seek accomodation elsewhere.,Date of stay: December 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ARTravel82

I was ill when we came back form our travels and the staff were concerned that I did not come down for breakfast and offered to get a doctor and when declined offered to send anything I may request up to the room. Later when my family were out I answered a knock at the door and one of the kitchen staff had brought me a specially made soup to ""cure"" my upset tummy.  I was extremely touched by their empathy and hospitality.

Riad Houdou,JRGGRl wrote a review Apr 2009,40,Excellent but some lapses,We really enjoyed our two night stay. The atmosphere was quiet and relaxing. The reception was friendly and relaxed. There was also good practical help in getting around the Medina and in dealing with the usual nuisances.  The main lapse was that the arranged collection at the airport did not materialise. This was compounded by the fact that the telephone number quoted in the email exchange to arrange booking was out of date. There was also no hot water on our second night.,Date of stay: March 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Epsom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JRGGRl
Riad Houdou,veneziaDorset wrote a review Mar 2009,50,Haven of peace.,I booked this riad without any reviews to base decision on. From the moment I contacted the host via e mail until the moment my friend and I left Lachen (?spelling) could not have done more for us. We had a tasty hot meal cooked for us on arrival without pre booking. Breakfasts were great Lachen booked a wonderful local restaurant (Le Fondouk). He told us how to get to places and told us to ring him if we were lost. I cannot praise the service too highly. My appalling sense of direction would have benefitted from a more obvious location so it seems unfair to mark it down for that. Lachen even wrapped a plate that I had bought to ensure it made it home. I would highly recommend this riad.,Date of stay: March 2009,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Dorset,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/veneziaDorset
Riad Houdou,el015e wrote a review Mar 2009,50,A beautiful Riad - well recommended!,My partner and I stayed here for 3 nights in March and had a wonderful stay. The Riad is an absolute haven compared to the crazyness of Marrakesh! We were 'helped' by two guides to find the Riad - we would have NEVER have found it otherwise! You should definately call the Riad when you get dropped off as it would be impossible to navigate the narrow streets. After the initial shock of Marrakesh we were soon well aquainted with the souks Medina and the Jamaa El Fna and everything was easy to navigate! The breakfasts at the Riad were delicious and the service and welcome we recieved was fantastic. We had a lovely stay and our host booked a really good spa for us for a Haman - really reccomended! Also Founduk restaurant is quite expensive but well worth the service food and surroundings! Having said that the grilled meats and sausages that we had in the square was just as delicious at a fraction of the cost!,Date of stay: March 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,el015e,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/el015e

Riad Houdou,iwon2654 wrote a review Jan 2009,50,The accommodation that made our holiday extra special,Riad Houdou is an oasis of calm and warm hospitality amongst the chaotic sensory overload that is Marrakech. We stayed for four nights over the 2008-2009 new year and our butler Simon was the host from heaven. The welcome tea and cake on our arrival in the warm living louge was already indication we were to be spoiled for the rest of our stay. No request was too much of a trouble and the attention to detail in terms of service and decoration were extraordinary. Whether it was a last minute request for dinner on our arrival or having breakfast at 5:45am (we had an excursion to the High Atlas departing at 7am) our host accomplished all of them with a smile and efficiency. Most rooms had their own private patio or terrace and everything was decorated beautifully in the fusion style of French and berber. The photos you see on their website www.riadhoudou.com is exactly what you get.    A tip to would-be holidayers is to call the riad on arrival in airport to arrange a pickup. There is no way I repeat NO WAY you can find the riad on your own even if you have visited Marrakesh before. Phone cards are cheap and available from tabacco shops in the airport. Our pickup arrived in 15 minutes and the transport took us to as far as large vehicles could go and our butler Simon met us there and led us through the chaotic narrow streets to the riad which was unmarked and was at the end of a very dark alley.    We enjoyed our stay very much and we tipped Simon well. I would definitely stay here again.,,,Mechelen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iwon2654
Riad Houdou,theyolomum wrote a review Nov 2008,50,"If you want the experience of a Riad, this is a good choice",There seems to be hundreds of Riads in Marrakech so if you haven't been before it can be a nightmare trying to decide which one to choose. But first you need to decide it's definitely a Riad that you want. If you want a real moroccan experience where you are in amidst the real hustle and bustle of Marrakech go for a Riad. If you want a standard tourist holiday go for a hotel. Most of the hotels are in the new part of the City but most of the Riads are in the medina which is the old City close to the famous Djemma el Fna. To see the real Marrakech I would recommend a Riad.    First the practical things about the Riad - clean safe constant hot water and everything you need about 5-10mins quite straight forward walk to the square which is where you will probably spend a lot of time. At first if you haven't been to Marrakech before it seems like the Riad is in a dodgy area however you soon realise that's just how the old city is and it's much more fun with much more character than the new City.    It's a really cozy pretty house and a haven after you have spent a day out in the medina it's like a mini palace hidden behind walls. The roof terrace is nice and good for sunbathing (it was sunny and around 25C when we were there). Stayed in the Atlas room which has it's own small terrace which is good for breakfast and sitting out for a drink at night. Breakfast was lovely and filling.    The management and staff at the Riad were so friendly and helpful. Big thank you to Simo who did everything for us - nothing was too much trouble. He even walked with us to the square to show us where it was and also came to the souks with us one day to help us negotiate the best prices. They can organise anything you need at the Riad and will advise of the best places to go and what to do. The transfers we booked with the Riad were also straight forward.    This is the only Riad I have been to so I can't compare however I really liked it and would definitly go and stay there again. You can probably turn up to Marrakech without accommodation and find something once you are there for a cheaper price. But if you want to be sure of what you are getting especially if you have never been before I would recommend booking something in advance and this Riad is a good choice.,Date of stay: November 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Manchester UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theyolomum
Riad Houdou,HarryTCat wrote a review Aug 2008,50,Amazing Houdou,My husband and I have just got back from an amazing trip to Morocco and while in Marrakech we stayed at Riad Houdou and it made our trip to Marrakech even more special.  The riad is a little oasis in the medina and I would reccomend this riad to anyone who wants to stay in a stunning place a little of the beaten track.  The staff are amazing and go that extra mile for you. The breakfast is really yummy and sets you up for the day. We also had a meal there one night and it was amazing (we are vegetarian and so they adapted their normal menu for us)  We stayed in the Atlas room that has its own private terrace and is at the top of the house so quite private and great for honeymooners.  The staff arranged for my husband to go to a local Hammam that was not touristy. One of the members of staff also walked with us to Djeema El-Fna square on our first day to show us the route it is about a 10 minute walk and we did it both during the day and at night ( we got a bit lost one night but just asked someone who pointed us in the right directing)  As it is tricky to find initially ask for directions or for someone to meet you.  The riad also has a small pool that was really nice to have at the end of a long day in the souks and city.  I would not hesitate to stay here again and look forward to my next trip.,Date of stay: July 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HarryTCat

Riad Houdou,Geordiegirl_8 wrote a review Apr 2008,40,Oasis in Marrakech,We stayed here during Easter week so it was a bit more expensive than usual. We found Riad Houdou to be very good - clean peaceful and relaxing. It has a lovely tranquil atmosphere and fits the picture of a good Riad. We had had clean sheets and towels and fresh flowers every day. The breakfasts were cooked everyday and were healthy and plentiful. In the last night we ate in the Hotel and had a beautiful meal on a rose-petal strewn table. We were in the Atlas Room on the roof and liked the atmosphere and balcony    It took us about 20 minutes to reach the main square going along a twisty lane and through the souks. Everyone including local people gravitates towards 'The Square' at night time and local people constantly direct you towards it (even if you don't want to go there). However at night time it is different (and dark) and we got taxis back (after lots of negotiation). The Riad is in the Tanneries area so it doesn't always smell wonderful and there are very local shops nearby. There are no cafes and the nearest restaurant (Foundouk) is very upmarket and you have to book. Don't expect local cafes and restaurants - this is not a tourist area    A word of warning - we wanted to travel a bit and found it hard to get any organised coach trips. We eventually went on an excursion with Sahara Expedition to Ouarzazate via Ait Ben Haddou. I would advise against this. We ended up in a very old minibus with no seatbelts or suspension. There were nine English Tourists and the driver didn't speak English. The so called 3 hour journey with an hour in the Ait benHaddou village turned into 9 hours on the minibus a photostop at the Village and just over two hours in Ouarzazate. This was a rip off    I would recommend going to the Coast though - we went to Essaouria on a local bus (Supra Tours) which was much better. Essaouria is an attractive but windy venue. You had to buy bus tickets in advance.    We found out that a number of people hire a jeep/car with a driver to visit somewhere. The Riad can book this for you. I imagine it's cheaper safer and more enjoyable than the 'excursion' companies.    Marrakech is an interesting venue and is rapidly changing. My impression is there are several types of traveller: back-packers/young people; day visitors who descend on the souks in hordes; people who stay in upmarket hotels outside the medina (old walled city) and the newer Riad dwellers. There are not a lot of sites to see like European cities but instead there are venues souks and a very different type of atmoshere. We liked the Museum Marrakech/ Madrasa (get the ticket for the 3 venues) the Dutch Anthropologist's Museum - Maison Tiskiwan(a true treasure) and the Majorelle Garden (once we found it - maps here are not very accurate). Just walking along the souks (and getting lost) is enjoyable in itself.,Date of stay: March 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Geordiegirl_8
Riad Houdou,Sarai2879 wrote a review Mar 2008,40,Perfect for our last night in Marrakech,We had 3 criteria for the riad for our last night in Marrakech- nice terrace for sunbathing a splash pool and nearer the main square than our riad earlier in the week. This place ticked all the boxes superbly. We stayed in the lovely blue twin room on the main terrace with our own private terrace too! Spent the whole day lounging about and refreshing in the freezing splash pool in its own courtyard. Then in the evening we had a lovely short walk for last minute shopping in the souks and soaking up the atmosphere in la place. Lovely furnishings throughout lemon trees in the courtyard and great breakfast. Loved the water fountain with fresh flowers in the courtyard and the gorgeous painting of the souks in the lounge (I tried but could not find one for myself in the souks that evening). My only complaint was the rather stagnant smell from the plants on the terrace but some things can be lived with especially for the lovely fuscia coloured flowers!,Date of stay: March 2008,,Sarai2879,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sarai2879
Riad Houdou,Loz3377 wrote a review Mar 2008,50,Sanctuary in Marrakech,I'm not normally a reviewer. However my new husband and I have recently returned from a five night honeymoon in Marrakech during which we stayed at this tremendous Riad - decision helped by a review on Trip Advisor. I feel compelled to share our experience so that other lucky travellers can benefit like we did all going well as it did for us - granted everyone has different experiences and expectations. It surpassed ours.  Few rooms so really peaceful. So much so that you could hear the courtyard birds delicately tweeting to each other and the relaxing water feature bubbling away. It is beautifully decorated & clean and has fabulous staff. The girls cook wonderful food (you must eat there at least once. We had breakfast every morning and ate dinner there twice). An extremely thoughtful attentive polite friendly manager (named Lassan) and lovely night watchman (named Abdel). Don't worry if you can't speak French... but it really helps if you do - in general in Marrakech. There's a view of the Atlas mountains from the terrace we didn't expect to see quite the way we did. Absolutely stunning on a clear day.  We left it too late to book the suite which was already booked - wouldn't normally consider a suite but it was our honeymoon afterall. However we stayed in the Atlas room instead based on a review from Trip Advisor. Great choice - best choice for us. It was tucked away at the top of the terrace and was bijoux and perfect; especially with it's own privte terrace (like the review said) where we sat with wine listened to music and played cards in the early evenings while the sun went down before going out at night. Despite not booking the suite the most excellent manager Lassan whom I feel was like a close friend after the five days made up the unoccupied suite for us to stay in on the Saturday night as a gift since we were on our honeymoon - what a treat what a thoughtful gem!  The doors had padlocks which make you feel that little bit more comfortable when you leave for the day that your belongings are safe. Even if we didn't have that lock we know everything would have been safe anyway; the front door is never unlocked. Not to forget the rooms actually have safes in them.  Admittedly there is a bit of a walk to the main square but we enjoyed that because it allowed us to soak up more of the medina's atmosphere and day to day goings on. An accidental plus point for us. not for everyone I know... it was only 10 mins or so...  Overall our five days in Marrakech was a fabulous holiday enhanced by our selection of the Riad Houdou. Lots of history and places of interest to explore colours vibrant people friendly food wonderful.,Date of stay: February 2008,,Reading,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Loz3377
Riad Houdou,SylviaRoses wrote a review Jan 2008,50,paradise in Marrakech,We had a superb stay in this beautifully decorated riad in november. The courtyard with the orange trees the roof terrace the rooms they were all lovely. The living/diningroom cosy with its fire going something important for the winter nights (there were heaters in all the rooms and air conditioning for people that go in summer). We stayed in the Noujoum Suite which was lovely.It is situated in the middle of the medina off the tourist track at about 10 min. from the square. The minute you walk into the riad the peace and serenity welcomes you and you can withdraw from all the bustle outside with a glass of wine.  The staff was excellent. Lahcen the manager pampered us and made us feel like kings. He showed us the way to the square the first day and pointed out some of the sights we should go and see.

Riad Houdou,pupsan wrote a review Dec 2007,50,Wonderful service,We have just returned from 3 nights at the Riad Houdou. We booked the Riad after reading all of the great reviews and we were not disappointed. The Riad was beautiful and the staff were fantastic often going out of their way to help us. One member of staff seemed to wait up until we returned (no matter how late) and magically opened the front door just as we reached it. And then he would be up bright and early in the morning making the delicious breakfast but always had a friendly smile.    Marrakech itself was a wonderful friendly place and once you adjust to the hustle bustle and banter you realise that the majority of the locals are genuine and do just like to stop and converse with you. The ability to speak French is a definite bonus as English is not widely spoken. There are a few incredibly persistent people but remain firm and polite and eventually they will get bored and leave you alone.    All in all we thoroughly enjoyed out trip and would recommend Riad Houdou wholeheartedly to anyone planning a holiday to Marrakech.,Date of stay: December 2007,Trip type: Traveled with friends,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pupsan

The service from the staff was excellent and meals were delicious and beautifully served.  The only difficulty was finding the riad; the petite taxis can not quite reach it and there are two streets with the same name.

If you've seen the amazing pictures on the website i can promise the reality is just as good.

Riad Houdou,chipmonkcharlie wrote a review Sep 2007,50,Lovely tranquil riad with first-class service,We had a fantastic stay at Riad Houdou. We were in the Atlas room which was very pleasant and comfortable and had its own private terrace and a nice view - when we arrived there were rose petals sprinkled around the room which was a lovely touch. The riad itself is not too hard to find - once you get onto Rue Issebtiyne the Derb el Hammam is then signposted - It is only a 10 minute walk to Place Djemaa el-Fna.    The riad was lovely and tranquil with lime trees and a fountain in the courtyard and the birdsong of little birds hopping around the roof terrace. A perfect respite from the hustle and bustle of the surrounding streets. The breakfast was delicious and included homemade yoghurt pancakes flatbreads and omelettes.    When we arrived the manager Abdou gave us some mint tea and some really helpful maps including a hand-drawn one to direct us back to the main square. Abdou's hospitality (as well as the rest of the staff) throughout our stay was fantastic the best we experienced in Morocco. He was discreet and helpful and did whatever he could to make our stay enjoyable bringing us some spontaneous mint tea when we were relaxing on the terrace and even preparing a small breakfast for us at 4.30am on the day we left - far beyond the call of duty!    We would highly recommend this riad to anyone staying in Marrakech.,Date of stay: September 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chipmonkcharlie
Riad Houdou,tiggerHorsham wrote a review Aug 2007,40,quite retreat,we stayed in the noujoum suite as it was a special occasion and it lived up to our expectations from the images on the internet. The room was such a welcome retreat to get away from the hustle and bustle of marrakech life. The riad has an adequate terrasse to chill out on when the temperature starts to drop. This is very relaxing. On the ground floor is the court yard were you have breakfast of yoghurt bread and pancakes and of course the best fresh orange juice of which you can get anywhere in morocco its a must to cool your thirst. Also on the ground floor is the splash pool which is a god send when you come back from all your shopping in the souks.  The staff are very accomodating it does help if you do speak french but dont worry a guy called Sied can speak some english so if your french isnt up to scratch he will help out. Also Sied will help you with directions call taxis and generally make your stay as comfortable as possible.    The only problem which I need to point out is the location of the riad. We caught a taxi to get us to this place and the taxi driver wasnt too keen about driving us through the never ending passage ways. These passage ways do get quite narrow as either side there are street sellers and the general daily hectic life of people coming and going. So make the taxi driver know exactly where this riad is and also clarify how much you are going to pay him. We paid 50Dh but this was from the bus station.    One word of warning the taxi drivers love to try and rip you off also if your lost the local kids or even some guys try and do the same. Apart from that we will return to morrocco we love it.,Date of stay: August 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,horsham,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tiggerHorsham

The riad was within 10 minutes walking distance of Djemma El Fna (the main square) and was nothing short of a little oasis away from the hustle and bustle of the main streets.    Upon arrival we were given some mint tea and lovely cake and then whisked away to our room. The room was on the small side (but I think all riad rooms probably are) but clean comfortable and furnished with a heater - very useful during the cooler nights.    Breakfast each morning was served in the courtyard and absolutely delicious: freshly-squeezed orange juice coffeehome-cooked pancakes fresh yoghurt bread jams and omelette presented in a tagine.    There was a lovely roof terrace which we used extensively; the riad does not have a pool but given the time of year we visited (April) we did not find that an issue.    The service levels by the staff were wonderful; they could not have done enough for us. Whether it was giving us directions checking local forecasts providing us with drinks making sure we were comfortable on the roof terrace or carrying our luggage to the nearest taxi point (5 mins away) they were highly attentive.    Unlike another reviewer we were able to pay by either credit card or by cash - however there is a 6% surcharge if paying by credit card (thanks to the complexities of the banking system) so I would recommend thinking ahead and pulling out the necessary cash from an ATM.    We will certainly go back to Riad Houdou when next in Marrakech!,Date of stay: April 2007,,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnelisedeMoravia

This they did and I accepted both quotes. When we arrived at the airport there was no-one to meet us and when I phoned the Riad the manager clearly had never heard of us. I eventually persuaded him to send someone for us and we arrived in the Medina.    The Riad Houdou itself if lovely but be warned it is situated right in the middle of the Medina and you do have to walk to get there. Once we arrived the manager maintained that there had been no request for a taxi despite me showing a copy of the email they had sent me. He also knew nothing about the day trip. Eventually he claimed that Mahmoud who had sent the email no longer worked there and arranged the trip to the mountains for us.    On our last day when we came to check out we queried being asked to pay for another taxi back to the airport as I believed that I had been quoted (30 Euros) for a return journey. At this point the manager became quite aggressive and we were forced to back down and pay the extra - even having to go to the airport cash machines to get more.    Also I was not informed at the time of booking that the Riad did not take credit or debit cards despite being able to pay the deposit with a credit card. This meant that we had to go to the main square and withdraw a substantial amount of cash to pay them - something that given the citing of the Riad I felt quite unhappy about.    I would definately not recommend this Riad - the service from the manager was appalling and extremely unfriendly. Also the location of the riad in an unlit back alley could be quite intimidating and it is a good 10-15 minute walk through very crowded streets to get to the main square.,Date of stay: November 2006,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrslab
Riad Houdou,Roverford wrote a review Aug 2006,50,Fantastic,We had booked a family room at the riad houdou for 2 nights. It was not shown on the tourist map and no taxi driver will want you to take you there because it is located right in the heart of the souks. We took a taxi to the main square (jema el fena) and then hired a cart man to take us and our luggage to the riad which is about a 15 mins walk. However taxis can get a few yards from the riad because we took one from there to the airport this was at crack of dawn so there was hardly any traffic. For some reason you do not know it is a riad until you get there which is a bit surprising because a sign on the front would definitely attract more customers. Anyway once inside this is a certain paradise. It is an environment of calm and comfort compared to the outside just a few yards away in the souks. Our room was very well presented and had air conditioning. There is a family atmosphere and the staff were polite and attended to any problems. A jacuzzi size pool the sun terrace and tv room were the other areas that we used during our stay. Breakfast was brilliant. Infact no other people were staying at the riad while we were there so we had it all to ourselves. Totally luxurious.,,,Walsall,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roverford
