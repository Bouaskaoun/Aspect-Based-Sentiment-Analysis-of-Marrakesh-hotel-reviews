The Central House Marrakech Medina,ivana n wrote a review Mar 22,50,Best hostel of Marrakech,I went with a very large group of 46 people. The hostel was so flexible and the people and the owner so friendly. They did everything they could to make our stay as good as possible. They helped me with reservations for dinner with this big group and made sure we could get breakfast every day. The hostel itself is a place of calmness in the chaos of the medina. It is beautiful and relaxed vibes when you go to Marrakech you really should stay here! The location is also perfect because in a few minutes you are in the middle of the medina.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vakantiegirl

The Central House Marrakech Medina,Braxton P wrote a review Mar 13,50,Best hostel I've ever stayed in,This hostel is in the perfect location and is very safe feeling. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. They gave us tips on where to go for food shops and even what time to arrive at the airport. They had 3 levels with an upper rooftop and a bar downstairs with food that we ate every morning lunch and dinner. Only negatives were that the pool was freezing the hostel was a little strict (12am bedtime),Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/209braxtonp
The Central House Marrakech Medina,Janet wrote a review Mar 12,50,By far my best trip all in all.,Despite going on a solo trip - my first ever..I still can’t express enough how much fun I had.  To begin with every single staff member here is amazing and so accommodating especially the bartenders. Very clean and good sized rooms you have privacy but I’d say it’s also very easy to socialise with your roommates (stayed in a 6 bed female dorm) if you want to as well as other guests! The location is in the centre of pretty much everything easy to walk to places and not actually complicated to reach if you ask me all the reviews I read saying it’s hard to locate were exaggerated (provided you have data and use maps you’re fine).  Also Marrakesh in general didn’t feel scary for me as a solo traveller either so long as you don’t come home past 11pm ish by yourself!,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled solo,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jan2342

The Central House Marrakech Medina,Melanie R wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Great accommodations for your trip to the Souks,Absolutely great stay at the Central House. Easy to book online with accurate room descriptions and decent prices. Clean rooms with A/C and heat comfortable beds and nice bathrooms/linens. The breakfast was wonderful as was the very helpful front desk staff. Our party spent plenty of time at the fun bar in the hotel's beautiful courtyard. We enjoyed drinks great music provided by the best bartender named Mouad and a flavorful menu. A fitting end after a day wondering the souks of Marrakech.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Curaçao,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melanieDCr
The Central House Marrakech Medina,Stuart F wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Oasis,Marrakech is a very bustling city but this is an oasis of calm in the busy medina. It is bigger than other riads I stayed at and as a result can afford a professional front desk and much better facilities. There is a beautiful large rooftop deck as well as a ground level swimming pool. It is by far the best place I stayed in Morocco.,Date of stay: January 2023,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stuartfP3760OH

Cars can’t drive in there so porters want to carry your bags which is fine but they are not happy with what you give them. I saw another family come in and the porter demanding more.

The Central House Marrakech Medina,Milo Browne wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Most luxurious hostel I’ve stayed in. Big thank you to all the staff- amazing stay!,BEST hostel I’ve stayed in anywhere over the world. I stayed for 4 nights and even though it is more expensive than some other hostels- there is no comparison. The building is beautiful and clean and facilities are top top class for hotel let alone a hostel; not many have a bar a huge roof terrace with sun loungers and a courtyard pool. Well located in a buzzing part of the medina. This is all without mentioning the most important part- the staff! They were some of the most helpful charming and friendly people and went out of there way to help chat and entertain. Lots of chat about football and plenty of laughs; I was actually sad to leave! It’s clear that they all enjoy being here and that shows through in the places relaxed professional and happy vibe.

The Central House Marrakech Medina,Oskar H wrote a review Jan 2023,50,A bit pricey but definitely worth it.,Cozy and comfortable hostel in the middle of the Medina in Marrakech. Short walk from the main square and more. Slightly pricy but definitely worth it as it is extremely clean and feels very safe. Nice after a day of people trying to gusset you in the Medina. Great place to meet likeminded travelers and make friends. Would recommend spending a bit extra for the cleanliness and safety of mind.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Barcelona, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oskarh524
The Central House Marrakech Medina,Katie M wrote a review Jan 2023,50,Fantastic dorm experience,Great Riad in a fantastic location. The building itself is bright and superbly clean with a great roof terrace.    The hostel dorms have crisp white bedding with loads of under bed storage for big cases and backpacks. The dorms were super comfortable even for an older traveller!    The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful and the level of customer service was top notch.    The only comment I would make would be that shared bathrooms in the dorms could be cleaned more thoroughly but all other areas were spotless.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled solo,"L'Alpe d'Huez, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T9889RDkatiem

This Hostel is the essence of beautiful Moroccan design and decor. The bed mattress was thick and firm. Everything was clean. Location was just off the souk and big Medina.

The Central House Marrakech Medina,Theresa J wrote a review Dec 2022,30,Short stay in Marrakesch,We had a good stay at the Central House in Marrakesch. But it sad that at the time we arrived (9pm) the door of our room could not be opened because it was defect. So we had to wait more than one hour in the cold after a long journey to get it the room.  It was also not that good that the shower had no curtain so after having a shower the whole bathroom was wet.  Besides that the hostel is very beautiful.,Date of stay: December 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theresaj211

The Central House Marrakech Medina,Davina G wrote a review Dec 2022,40,One of my best holidays,This riad is stunning super clean and good food and drinks at the bar if you want to stay in.  We stayed for 3 nights in a 4 room dorm we hit the jackpot with the guests we shared with and had a blast !  My highlight of the hotel was the staff members my absolute favourite was Nassima who works on front desk- she made my trip!! Nassima found us Hammams ensured she secured prices organised transfers - recommended places to eat and things to do for n this majestical city.  On my first encounter with Nassima she tied my head scarf in a traditional way so I felt comfortable. Nassima treated me like family !  I owe her soo much for her kindness  There were a few other staff members that were awesome including AhmedKarima Ashraf Hamza and Mouad and not forgetting the Ops manger Olivia.  I must say the hostel is tucked away but Nassima showed us Maps me - which helped us navigate.  Hostel has strick rules about talking in their communal areas after 11pm and there is no where for guests to chat and chill after this time and we were often told it’s management policy we should be in our rooms after that time - which felt heavy handed for a holiday especially if you are sharing a dorm and not ready to sleep.  We were told this was policy it was if the staff were at times not permitted to use their discretion. Overall was a great stay and I would stay again especially to see Nassima and Ahmed who were exceptionally professional and authentically kind  Hostel needs to invest in soundproof room for solo travelers to mingle and talk about what the city has to offer  Deffo try strawberry mojito -it’s lush !!! Their chicken Tagine was also yummy.  Beds are comfy in the dorm cleaning lady Radeya was super sweet too.  Towels available to rent deposit needed under bed storage available it dorms. You need a padlock available to rent as well with deposit  There is no lift so would not advise large luggage unless you are prepared to carry it up and down stairs.  Not sure about accessibility for disabled guests too.    Very pretty riad and the main Gem was Nassima.,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/01deedee10
The Central House Marrakech Medina,Imari wrote a review Nov 2022,30,Solo Backpacking at the Rodamon,I think this is the perfect place for first-timers to the Hostel scene or solo traveling; the place in many ways is more like a hotel than a hostel and this is very pleasing. The staff is friendly amiable & the security is top notch. Finally the beds are comfortable and the bunks modern.    However having a “lights out time” the surrounding area and the price are its main drawbacks.  I don’t believe versed travelers will enjoy not having an area to chat & chill with fellow travelers after the restaurant & bar closes; I presume that’s why many would book this instead of an Airbnb or Hotel. Also for the price I think the eight-bed dorm which I booked was more on the expensive end when similar places offer cheaper four-bed dorms. Despite the surrounding area being out of their control be sure to be vigilant when returning alone late at night.,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Wilmington, North Carolina",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ImariN1

After a day you feel like a family.  - For a hostel the rooms are very clean  - The place itself is gorgeous the pictures don’t do it justice!  - Excellent area!    The only negative (and it’s not that much of a negative; it’s just not perfect) :  Breakfast was plain and nothing special.

The Central House Marrakech Medina,Daphne wrote a review Nov 2022,20,"The place is lovely all in all, but the staff made a mistake and wouldn't take responsibility for it","The hostel and its facilities is indeed really really nice. But I had a very weird incident with the staff and I don't know who's to blame for it - either the hostel policy or the specific staff that was there... but it really made my stay unpleasant.  What happened was I inquired about a pick up from the CTM bus station and was told it costs 150 dirham and that it is booked. I took a taxi for this exact ride a week before therefore I knew its twice the price that a taxi takes so I wrote exactly that and got a response that this is a fixed price for a shuttle so I responded thank you I'll just find a taxi and arrive independently. I didn't get a response to the last email. When I arrived at the CTM station a driver from Rodamon was waiting for me. I tried to explain that this is must be a misunderstanding but he didn't speak English so he called his boss which said I need to take the taxi and sort it out with the hostel. at the the hostel they said that they indeed got the email but it probably fell between the chairs as they had busy days or some kin of problem with the internet and I do need to pay the whole amount. they also said ""so why did you take the taxi then"" (which is a very weird approach ) and refused all in all to take responsibility even though they admitted it in some evading way. and it is simply and obviously their fault. VERY basic thing in hospitality.  the staff was very unkind and unhelpful and a bit childish as well. This is NOT a personal thing but they acted is if it was and just wouldn't take the blame... It was super weird. Eventually they agreed that I'll pay 80dirhem and they will pay the rest but ""threatened"" me that I will not be able to book any other rides with them anymore. oh well..",Date of stay: November 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaphneMaayan

Super friendly and helpful staff who are happy to give local recommendations for food navigating the souks and what price you should pay for taxis etc to help you not get ripped off.

The staff are lovely too and feels very safe. Breakfast is extra and ok. I marked 1 star down as they don't really organise group hostel tours. They only help arrange expensive private tours so I had to find all my walking tours and excursions online separately. Would be good to have hostel tours as would help meet other backpackers.

The Central House Marrakech Medina,151Brodiew wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Don't look any further just book this one,I'll start by saying I'm very picky when it comes to choosing accomadtion I spend hours looking at airbnb booking.com and googling places.  So I'll do you a favour by saying dont look any further just book this place.    It's up there with some of the 5 star hotels I've stayed at.    We had a double room with its own toilet and shower. The room was huge and simple but beautifully decorated. You could hardly hear any noise from outside the room.  Most of the guests at the hostel are around there 30s so it's not loud at night.    The whole hostel is immaculately clean.    And don't get me started on the staff every single staff member was so friendly helpful and just pure amazing.    The morrocoan food on the menu was some of the best food we had whilst here.    The Strawberry mojito is delicious.    The location is the perfect walking distance to everything the area was safe enough I wouldn't walk around as a female alone but I feel like that's anywhere you stay in Marrakesh.    If there was one thing I think could be improved if I had to be picky would be the double bed was two single beds pushed together so a mattress topper would be nice so we didn't feel the crack in the middle but once again not a big deal the bed was comfortable with comfy pillows.

The atmosphere in the common areas is so much nicer than many hostels.  Most of the staff is kind and helpful.    The breakfast is bellow average. If you're adventurous you may be better off finding your first meal somewhere else in the Medina.    The spa that Rodamon partners with is definitely in the budget category. It's ok if you're trying to get the best price possible. However by paying just 20% more you can have a better experience at some of the highly rated spas and hammams that are in the immediate area.,Date of stay: August 2022,,"Austin, Texas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidDD82

It’s really a boutique hotel an oasis on the Medina. The staff from the front desk to the bar and restaurant are possibly the most welcoming staff I have ever had while traveling. The food was better than any restaurant I had around town and well priced as well. Literally everything was perfect.

The Central House Marrakech Medina,bry_bry91 wrote a review Aug 2022,50,Great staff in some beautiful accommodation,Rodamon Riad is a beautifully renovated and maintained accommodation. There are a variety of room options and the small swimming pool and bar area was a welcome relief in the heat of Marrakesh.  There were also lots of opportunities to meet other people which was very welcome as a solo female traveller and the staff were consistently approachable helpful and welcoming.  The location is good as it is close to some of the highlights of the northern Medina however personally I did find that area slightly more difficult to navigate in comparison to the southern end of the medina.  Thanks again to all of the great staff there I absolutely would recommend.,Date of stay: August 2022,,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bry_bry91

The Central House Marrakech Medina,Gaby C wrote a review Jul 2022,50,Amazing hostel!,Staying here in marrakesh during the summer was amazing - felt very luxurious even though it was still affordable! The courtyard and pool were a great escape from the busy Médina (and 45 degree heat) while still having a great central location and air conditioning in the rooms was great to have. As soon as we arrived we felt very safe and welcome and the staff are extremely helpful. We even received a free mint tea on arrival!    We also booked the airport transfer which was more expensive than a taxi from the airport would have been but they did take us directly to the hostel whereas a taxi would not have managed through the narrow streets.    We stayed in one of the female dorm rooms which was cleaned every day including them making our beds daily. The bathrooms were also lovely (two showers and two toilets as an ‘en-suite’ to the dorm).    The terrace was also a great place to relax (or have a rooftop shower!!) especially in the evening when it was a little cooler and the restaurant did good food which though a little pricy did huge portions.,Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gabycW15BS

A special mention for Younes and the young girl taking care of the bar in the mornings for their outstanding service!  Everything is greatly organised for a smooth stay. They are reasonable while very professional. The location is fantastic with easy access to taxis in the north and in the actual beautiful medina. The patio is as refreshing as it can be under the blasting heat in July.  Shared dorms are clean and look brand new.

The Central House Marrakech Medina,Kara M wrote a review Jun 2022,50,The best place to stay in the Medina (old city)!,Rodamon Hostel-Marrakech was more than we could have hoped for. An oasis in the middle of the old walled city of Marrakech. The hustle-bustle of the souk and Berber markets are right outside the door and inside you feel calm. The pool is refreshing the air conditioned rooms are beautiful and contain everything you need.  Our family of 3 stayed in a private room with a king bed and two bunk beds in a separate area; with a private bathroom and shower. Daily housekeeping similar to a hotel. The restaurant and bar on site are very convenient if you don’t want to venture out to the Medina for a meal.  The staff was EXTREMELY helpful and welcoming with clear directions and ideas for outings.    My advice is to email ahead to arrange for a pickup from the airport or train station when you arrive as the hostel is hard to find on your first arrival and cabs cannot drive right up to the door but take you as far as they can and will bring your luggage the rest of the way on foot. Private transport to hostel was 150 MAD ($15) paid to the hostel directly.    After a few days (and the awesome maps.me app) we found our way back “home” easily. Same for your departure if you arrange for transport at the desk of the hostel your driver will come gather you and take you to where he has parked his vehicle.,Date of stay: June 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Boulder, Colorado",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kara_felice

The Central House Marrakech Medina,Andrea B wrote a review Jun 2022,50,Hotel quality Hostel,I absolutely loved my time spent at the Rodamon Riad Hostel in Marrakech. My first stay I was in a 4 person female dorm room. I'd never stayed in a dorm room before and the experience couldn't have been better. Not only did I have wonderful roommates the room itself was clean well organized had air conditioning curtains on the beds and the option to lock your luggage in your own storage space. I appreciated too having a locked room that was only accessible with a key. My second stay later in the week was a private room that felt like a hotel room. Once again it was clean well stocked and safe. All of the staff I interacted with were incredibly helpful whether it was with booking activities (I booked a walking tour hammam visit and 3 day desert tour through them) or helping me when I spilled water all over my duvet. They were all ready and willing to help. I really appreciated it too when certain staff remembered my name - its always a nice touch! The common areas of the hostel were beautiful and well kept especially the rooftop! Such a beautiful place and I hope to come back someday.,Date of stay: June 2022,,"Provo, Utah",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anjb90

The Central House Marrakech Medina,Quest362661 wrote a review Jun 2022,50,"Fantastic staff, beautiful environment",I booked this hostel directly via their website and it was an easy process. The price was fair and provided good value for high quality accommodation.    The reason I chose it was that I was attending a weekend-long event there organised by the hostel itself. Both the event and the hostel were a totally positive experience from beginning to end.    The female dorm was spacious with a comfortable curtained bed individual light and shelf a massive locker for rucksack and hooks to hang stuff. It was a good temperature and there was plenty of space in the private bathroom attached to the dorm.    The common areas were beautiful on each level - a massive roof terrace with tables and also sun loungers and a various of spaces downstairs too. All of it was impeccably clean and taken care of.    Each member of staff was smiling and charming always ready to joke and help. I loved that they were happy and relaxed enough to express their characters too even in small ways. This really made a difference to me to feel that extra sense of individuality and connection with people enjoying their work.    Thank you all so much for a memorable weekend. I am very grateful to have been able to create a collection of happy memories at your hostel and I wouldn’t hesitate to return or to recommend it.

Staff were brilliant: I hounded Nassima Ahmed and Gemma constantly for recommendations and just general info about Marrakech and they were always very helpful. The breakfast lady and another male helper were always very friendly too.  Social spaces were beautiful and spacious: ground floor bar/restaurant area with pool great for meeting others or just relaxing; roof top area also huge and again beautiful (bar up here would be great!).  Rooms were good size and really clean; curtain private lamp and socket for each bed was very convenient. Even the bathroom was designed with Moroccan architecture in mind which I loved.

It is centered to Medina and you are pretty much near every place. Rodamon has definitely the best staff they were so much helpful and kind to us. It is also very clean.

The Central House Marrakech Medina,VictoriaG wrote a review Feb 2020,40,Oasis in the medina,The hostel is more like a hotel and perfect for a couple in a private room. The decor is gorgeous and so peaceful from the medina outside. The roof terrace was perfect for sunbathing and the bar serves alcohol and nice food. Our room was clean and the hotel staff were constantly cleaning painting and tending to the plants. It is a very well looked after Riad.    The location is also perfect within walking distance of lots of restaurants (Les Jardins du lotus Limoni Le Jardin Atay Cafe). I would definitely recommend staying here.    One thing to note is that we arrived late in the evening and the Riad isn’t accessible by car so we had to walk through the medina which was a bit scary for our first time here.

The Central House Marrakech Medina,Vezsapien wrote a review Jan 2020,50,🇲🇦MARRAKECH EXPRESS🇲🇦,We came here on a personal recommendation from a member of staff and friend at the Rodamon Riad Hostel a group of four (brothers) lads on a short break wish we had more time to spend there with staff who made our stay most hospitable & couldn’t do enough to do so I’m still shocked that this is referred to as a HOSTEL it’s more like a hotel really. I visit Morocco 🇲🇦 on a regularly basis pretty much every year sometimes even twice or three times a year from the onset we were greeted warmly by a hostel representative at the airport for shuttle transfers we would have normally made our own way to the city or main square but on this occasion we were going into unfamiliar territory plus it was quite late in the evening. We arrived at the hostel and were greeted by Hamza at reception who had arranged a 4 dorm room with private bathroom. we had mint tea whilst checking in and a brief warm chat. I have to say the design and architecture of the hostel is the immaculate I have stayed in many hotels riads and hostels in Morocco however this is unlike any hostel I have stayed in Morocco or overseas by that matter. This place is beautiful spotless the attention to detail is impressive along with members of staff whom made our stay very very welcome. The canteen kitchen/ dining area is located on the bottom ground floor next to the atrium courtyard and pool adjacent to it is the bar area. There was live entertainment on the night we arrived which had a relaxed chilled feel wish we there to see more of the events & activities scheduled. Also the rooms on different levels are beautifully executed to say the least you have the options of mixed dorms to separate suites or double rooms excellently maintained. Breakfast buffet is served which you have to pay for (usually) this was more than acceptable also we were told by a friend the restaurant canteen does serve meals but we didn’t get chance to taste the wonderful meals being served maybe next time. The top open terrace floor is my favourite spot “you could have an amazing party up there I reckon” amazing views overlooking the atlas mountains. The hostel is located at least a good 10-15 mins walk through the heart of the medina onto the the square you have to be a confident adventurous traveller I’d say to get about in the medina and square however with four brothers we managed to work this out we must have gone back and forth to the square at least 8 times or more day and night. I would be quite vigilant though if I was alone or even a group of females or a couple walking alone about this part of the medina as this is an area we have not explored before so if you love an adventure then go at it with confidence. The time here for us went quick as always we loved the feel of the place I can imagine what it’s like in the warmer months with more travellers backpackers and a mixed bohemian type of crowd I’d say that’s the vibe I got anyway. I will cone back at some stage with either friends or family (INSHALLAH) It has been a pleasure meeting members of staff and making friends whom no doubt will be still there when I re-visit again with that said me & my brothers extend our humblest warmest thanks & gratitude for making our stay not only memorable but one that hasforged a long friendship I hope and pray. (BEZAAF SCHUCRAAN) to all the staff @ Rodamon Riad Hostel AbdelwahdHamza the shuttle transfer drivers and the wonderful Hostel manager Gemma (thank you so much) take care all the BEST ... I hope to see you all again ... In’sha’allah 🙏,Date of stay: January 2020,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vezsapien

The Central House Marrakech Medina,Kate H wrote a review Jan 2020,40,Beautiful Hostel in Great Location,The Rodamon is a beautifully decorated hostel right in the heart of the medinas. The rooms are clean modern and well equipped (we stayed in 8 dorm room and there was plenty of space). Staff were super friendly and attentive always smiling and willing to help. Food was great and reasonably priced we especially enjoyed the breakfast!    The pool/bar area on the first floor does get cold if you're staying during Winter but as this is an open space it can't really be helped. Although the pool and rooftop lounges always left our clothes wet after sitting on them (the seats were initially dry upon touching) they may be old and in need of a change? Also the Wi-Fi is very spotty we didn't have any in our rooms and would often drop in and out.    Would like to have more of a social scene as they have a lot of common areas maybe if the hostel had organised social events or host activities it would be easier to meet other travellers. As when we were there we did find it difficult to meet other travellers and there were a lot of families staying there too.,Date of stay: December 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N6699PQkateh
The Central House Marrakech Medina,Frances W wrote a review Jan 2020,50,A superb base for exploring Marrakesh,We loved the Rodamon Marrakesh - we had a family room with double & a bunk bed not large but adequate for 3 nights. The pool area is lovely too cold for a dip in December but beautiful to sit by - the roof terrace is also great and there’s a bar serving alcohol which is not a given in Marrakesh. The staff were all professional and pleasant. They kindly arranged our transfers to & from the airport at very reasonable prices even when we were staying at a different riad for the second half of our trip to Marrakesh we had the Rodamon arrange this for 350 dirham less than our other riad. Breakfasts were also excellent and reasonably priced. And we are tagine and pasta dishes one evening which were also very good.

The Central House Marrakech Medina,Heather W wrote a review Jan 2020,50,"Lovely Riad, great location, helpful friendly staff",We just spent 5 nights at Rodamon Riad; it was an all round wonderful experience. This was our first visit to Marrakech so we had little idea what to expect the first surprise was that the Riad is right in the Medina Souk so foot access only - but it didn't matter at all we loved every minute of our time in Marrakech and Rodamon was excellent.  The property is beautifully maintained to a high standard; we had two superior double bedrooms both rooms were a very good size and the beds were super-king with fresh clean linen and very comfortable. There was not much storage for clothes a small closet to hang things in but no drawers so much of our stuff had to stay in our suitcases but this was OK for us because our room had lots of floor space it might be tougher in one of the standard or dorm rooms.  The bathrooms are on the small side but finished to a high standard and the showers are very good with no shortage of hot water and clean towels every day.  The roof terrace is lovely its a great place to sunbathe or just chill out in the afternoon especially after the hustle and bustle of the Souk.  The menu is very decent not exceptional but this is a Riad not a 5* hotel we were well catered for.  The one thing we hadn't bargained for is the cold; we were there in December and although by mid-afternoon the temperature in the sun was up to about 25 degrees in the shade it was cool and as any Riad is designed and built to stay cool it was never warmer than about 18 degrees within the building. We had A/C in our room so no problem with staying warm/cool at all but we were cold at breakfast time so if you go in winter take plenty of layers!  Finally the staff: I can't praise them enough they were endlessly friendly and helpful; we're reasonably self-sufficient and didn't need a ton of help from them but any time we did need anything they were right on it and every interaction was warm and friendly they are terrific.,Date of stay: December 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W5930RQheatherw

The man and woman at reception were so helpful in explaining the city map and the various do's and don'ts. The woman also kindly printed our boarding passes for us and arranged a number of excursions for us which was super helpful as a guide collects you from the reception and drops you off with a driver.    The whole property is spotlessly clean with fresh sheets and towels every day.    Breakfast is good value at just under €4 per day.

As a solo traveller it was a relaxing place to be but there was no social atmosphere and was mainly couples. The front desk staff were really kind and accommodating and sweet - not the same impression I had of the cold manager. The main problem I had at Rodamon was the fact that I paid for a tour from them (40€) turned out I paid double than everyone else on the tour (17€) - a cheap tripadvisor tour when they sold it as a privately organised tour. I trusted them. They refunded me a tiny portion of 5€ and the manager refused to talk to me.,Date of stay: November 2019,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Milan, Italy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hectorbabencojunior

The Central House Marrakech Medina,Kaithlyn R wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Highly recommended hostel - great place to stay!,Booked the pick-up from the airport with the hostel & started off our Marrakech trip with the friendliest man ever! The best thing about this place is the staff. Everyone is extremely nice and accommodating. Next is cleanliness. Have you ever been to a hostel where they clean your sheets on a daily basis? In a dorm room?!?! The private bathroom in the dorms was great. Always spotless. Airconditioner worked well. Beds are comfy. Laptop area downstairs is great lots of places to work if you're a digital nomad. The pool was cold so we couldn't swim in it at the time. But maybe when the weather is warmer. It was lovely having it there thought! Food was honestly pretty great as well compared to the tajines you could get outside.

The Central House Marrakech Medina,Raonaid M wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Rodamon Riad Marrakesh,This is the most Beautiful hostle I have ever stayed in. It’s spotless clean! To be honest it’s more like a 4* hotel with bunk beds. The grounds and staff are lovely and very helpful!    It is bang in the middle of the the Médina which is in the heart of the Kissel and bustle of Marrakesh. As soon as you step inside the hostle you could be a million miles from the chaos.    It’s absolutely immaculate too.    We booked a few tours through them too.

The Central House Marrakech Medina,Marša G wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Nice and modern,Nice riad everything is modern and clean. The terrace is beautiful. The staff is kind and helpful. The only issue was we didn’t get towels in our room which is a hustle for every traveler as you try to fit everything in your small bag. But you can get big one for 25 dh. We didn’t have breakfast included so we had to pay 40dh for it. The location is a bit far from the main sqaure (20 min cca) so at first you can get easily lost but once you learn the way it is okay.

The riad-style makes the place feel really spacious and open. The pool is small but perfect for sitting around.    I was really surprised how reasonable the price was here! Definitely getting value for money! Myself and my friend stayed in a 4 bunk female dorm which had it's own shower and toilet. We could also get decent wifi from our room.    We had a snack in the pool-side bar (chicken strips and fries to share) and a wine. Really reasonable prices again (about 100 dirham for food and drinks). This bar had music and lots of people socialising which created a nice atmosphere.    Later on we visited the square which isn't too far from the hostel and came back to have a drink on the rooftop. There was plenty of space and some sofas which was nice to relax in after the busy town.

The Central House Marrakech Medina,Cristinejs wrote a review Apr 2019,50,Great place to stay!,We ended up in Marrakesh after 5 days in Morocco. We had heard that the city was very crazy and busy and that we probably wouldn't want to spend 3 days here but we are happy we did! Rodamon hostel was more like a resort hotel. It was very relaxing and very well situated in the Medina. Our beds were very nice and comfortable and the breakfast/ food was delicious. It was a great place to come back to and relax during the day. The only downside is that they have a strict night policy where you are not allowed to hang out in the common areas so when we would come back at like 11pm we would have to just go to bed. We did end up finding another hostel called Layla Rouge that had a super amazing rooftop patio and very relaxed staff that we ended up spending some time at to enjoy some chicha and the roof top sunset views. Also our room was VERY hot at night and we were there in April so if you are travelling in the summer you may find it to be even more hot. I believe they do have air conditioning in the rooms though but I did not check or ask.    Overall a beautiful spot to enjoy and relax! Would definitely go back and would recommend to others.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Niagara Falls, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cristinejs

Located in the north east of Medina it's only 2 minute walk to Le Fondouke Fernatchi Spa Photography Museum of Marrakesh. About ten minutes to Cafe Árabe and Le Jardin Secret. Another ten minutes possibly to Jemaa el-fna and the madness that goes on there. Taxis are available about 5 minute walk away but can drop you off just outside the Riad. The place itself is stunning. Lovely little pool / bar area where you have your continental breakfast in the morning relax in the afternoon and have drinks at night. There's also a roof terrace. Staff are very helpful and friendly. The room was perfect - ensuite traditional and nicely decorated comfy bed and cleaned daily. I'd definitely stay here again.

The Central House Marrakech Medina,tomalley4 wrote a review Jan 2019,20,Style over substance,We stayed here for two nights. The first in dorm rooms (because private rooms were sold out) and the second night in a private room. First of all it is a beautiful looking hostel and the poor area is brilliant. It was a nice place to retreat to from the busy streets of Marrakech. I very rarely complain about places I stay but there were a few points I was not happy with about Rodamon Riad Hostel. Firstly beforehand we booked two beds in the same dorm room however upon arrival we were told that a larger party had arrived and they accomdated them and changed our booking so we were in two separate dorm rooms. This wouldn’t have been so bad but my girlfriend was spending her first night in a dorm room and was slightly nervous. Throughout the night the noise travels around the hostel and you can hear every door that is slammed. The breakfast in the morning was reasonable and ok but some of the buffet items ran out and took a while to be replaced. On the second night in our private room it was a good size. However the shower was blocked and kept flooding so we could not even shower before we had to fly home. All in all it is a nice looking hostel but I feel this is at the expense of the basic requirements of a place to stay. The location is good and you can get a beer here which is useful but it overpriced for what you get. It is ashame because I was really looking forward to staying here and it could be a great hostel but we did not have a good experience.,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomalley4

From here you can easily reach all the tourist sights and the souks. The hostel itself is sooooo beautiful! It’s a riad with green and white mosaique tiles. The roof terrace is huge and offers a lot of possibilities to sit or lie and enjoy the sun. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We stayed for 4 nights in a 4-bed-dorm which was nice and clean. The only thing missing was something to hang our jackets and towels. Next to the entrance there is also a café-area where you can hang out and also eat and drink something. I had a couscous/veggie tajine on the evening we arrived which was ok. But I would recommend to eat in one of the near-by restaurants instead.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Munich, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kathrin43

The breakfast is 40 dirhams and includes toast juice tea cereal yogurt some fruit (usually just grapes) cake tomato cheese butter jams and sometimes small pancakes. It is all very well maintained clean and modern and I would definitely recommend it to other people coming to Marrakech. The only downsides are the wifi not working sometimes and the pillow wasn’t all that great but to be honest it is pretty standard for a hostel.

The Central House Marrakech Medina,Aqeel wrote a review Aug 2018,50,A relaxing haven inside the crazy madina,If you're like me the first thing you do before you book somewhere is read review after review to find a regular theme of either good or bad and then make a decision.    That's exactly what I did with Riad rodamón and with the very small amount of negative reviews it was not enough to put me off and if I'm honest i do not see how this place can get any negative reviews.    I'm going to make this simple if you want to experience the madina and culture of true Marrakech but also want to balance this with relaxation and clean environment then this is the place to be.    The Riad is within walking distance of the main square Jemaa el-Fnaa and there are a few shops/huts near by that you can buy water drinks and snacks to take back to the hostel.    The riad itself is the most clean and beautiful hostel I've ever stayed at. I booked a superior double private room for my stay different from my normal shared dorm because of the reasonable price. The room was amazing with Moroccan style decor and AC for the boiling heat during August.    The roof terrace is such a cool place to relax catch some rays and hangout with friends or meet new people. The only thing that it didn't provide is the view as it suggests due the walls being high but that was very minor because you could see a beautiful sunset.    The pool area is amazing and relaxing with its garden style feel and water fountain feature sending you in to a zen state of mind. The pool itself may not be huge but it was a good size to cool off and hang with new people to talk to.    The staff there are the most helpful and polite who will go out there way to make sure your stay is everything you need. They help with taxis tours or guide you to where you need to go.    They also offer a nice food selection for the evening but limited during the day regardless still delicious.    I would 100% come back to this riad. The value for money the location cleanliness customer service and relaxing vibes is everything you need.    Oh and for any bloggers this is a heaven place for you to take pictures!

The photos don't lie. The staff is also excellent the rooms are clean and the place is just stunning.    The only problem is the location. The hostel is deep deep deep in the Medina making it a nightmare to find. After dark it's easy to get trapped in the closed souk where a local teenager will approach you and try to show you the way out. He'll then shake you down for money and not in a polite ""can I have a tip please"" sort of way. Felt more like assault. This happened to my friends and I on 3 separate occasions over 2 days. It was a common story among many of the travellers staying at Rodamon. The staff seemed well aware. It can be a very frightening experience for younger or single travellers. One fellow in my dorm was shaken down for a total of 800 dirhams in one day (about 80 euro) the moment he stepped out of Rodamon.    Friends at other hostels did not have this problem.

The rooms are great really well set up with plugs and lights etc. The breakfast was yummy and people were friendly! The only thing I think they can improve on his the taxi company they use. I booked a private taxi pick up from the hostel to bring me from airport and the taxi man made me wait 45mins for guests staying in another hostel to arrive... the taxi man saud I would still have to pay the full price to the hostel.. 150Dh. Even though he made me wait for others... plus the average taxi cost from medina to airport is 100dh I later learned. Then when we were living to go to bus station we were told the taxi company charges 150dh for that trip too.. even though it's much closer. We agreed as we didn't want to be wasting time negotiating taxi prices on the street without bags.. but the taxi was late and also made us walk the whole way about 10-15min through the medina with our bags instead of parking close by where we were initially dropped off. All in all... I think the hostel should negotiate a better contract with the taxi company or change company or do their own pick up!,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Cork, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michelleireland1

The Central House Marrakech Medina,Hlen wrote a review Jun 2018,10,A Word of Warning: Rodamon is Not a Safe Space,Warning: Victim-shaming racial bias and prejudice.    I'm sure this is a rare case in all hostels but my roommate was a racist. She held preconceived opinions about my identity. She made unwarranted remarks about my nationality ethnicity the way I spoke and even my hairstyle even though I was barely in the shared room. Her condescending remarks eventually escalated in her grabbing my throat and digging her fingernails into my neck. I found out later that the night before when she had caused a scene at 2:30 am about the air conditioning she had tried to attack me but the security had stopped her. At the time she told the manager that everything was my fault and he seemed to buy it while I was frozen because I felt traumatized.    I spoke to the manager the following day after the attack – when I had finally digested most of the situation it took a very long time to get him to empathize or at least sympathize. Finally a staff member explained to him that the woman was indeed racist. He took some action and assured me he has blacklisted her (I cannot confirm at this moment if that is true).    I truly felt that the situation could have been handled better. I was told I could have called the police or spoke up the night of the attack but I was traumatized by the event. I felt that the management did not know how to properly deal with situations like mine. I was sent straight to my new room no tea no water nothing was done to help me come down from my trauma. In fact it sounded like the whole situation was assumed rather than investigated.    They promised me an emailed formal apology and proof that the woman is blacklisted. But has yet to send me any of this information.    ***** So if you're a traveller looking for a safe space and a place that can help you when worse comes to worse in a foreign place – I would not suggest going to Rodamon hostels. They are not trained to deal with guests who a prejudice given that there seem to be no policies in place on investigating situations fairly.    It is your basic level hostel and it is very photogenic. It will do the job as long as the worst case scenario does not happen to you – which I hope it does not.    Overall I would say be warned. They will not call the police for you if you are in trouble. They will not help you feel safe at the hostel. They will not comfort you if you are distressed - I've been to a few hostels that I've seen do so and you're better off investing your money in that type of hostel.

Most people will choose a hostel over a hotel so they can meet other people especially in their rooms this place didn’t give that opportunity as some part were sectioned off.

We were originally in Room 1 (a 4 bed private) and I wouldn’t recommend it...it’s directly beside the breakfast area and reception so it’s very noisy and doesn’t have any natural light through the windows as they lead into the lobby area. However we were moved to the 2nd floor and our room was perfect. The beds are very comfy and the sheets/mattress feel very clean. They also have a cleaning crew that comes in and cleans your bathroom and makes your bed every day! It was a lovely surprise.    We organized a desert tour to Zagora through the hostel. It was excellent value (65€) but the overall quality of the tour was sub par. The organization seemed to lack once we made it to our camp. However it was an incredibly memorable experience and we loved the camels! Perhaps do some research prior to going on the overall experience but if you decide to go to Zagora this is definitely a great price for the trip.    We also did the Hammam through the hostel and it was a great experience! Seems to be a good price as well. They picked us up at the hostel and brought us to the spa which was nice as we didn’t have to navigate the busy streets to find it. I would recommend doing this through the hostel.    Lastly the staff were amazing! Hamza and the team made sure our stay was incredible and advised us on every excursion we wanted more information about.    Definitely stay at Rodamon! 10/10 experience :),Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Tamarindo, Costa Rica",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aszaboday
The Central House Marrakech Medina,AAATravel2017 wrote a review Jun 2018,50,"Great staff, great quality.",I loved everything about this place especially the helpful staff (went above and beyond) the nice rooms (I was in a private room) the breakfast and the bar. I did the desert trip which was far but totally worth it (3-day- bring warm clothes and a flashlight/portable charger) and the Hamman spa which was a great value (and they walk you to it). The bar had a nice social area food was ok    The place is a little confusing to find but most people around on the streets know where it is the only thing is if you accept their help they will expect a decent sized tip. My only complaint is that the wi-fi was pretty much non-existant.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AAATravel2017
The Central House Marrakech Medina,rjliahonaburgos wrote a review May 2018,40,Feels like a hotel,With your maps.me it is easy to find this road in the heart of the Medina. It is an epitome of irony--its walls and entrance being bland and unwelcoming but once inside you will be mesmerised by its intricately designed interior. Spacious clean not the typical hostel. The guy in the bar area and the chef were really entertaining though and Karima was helpful too. :) One night a girl in the dorm room was puking so hard that it was a pain to use the toilet so I requested the receptionist at 5 in the morning if I could use the other room's toilet and he did not disappoint me.

The Central House Marrakech Medina,rosie b wrote a review May 2018,50,Amazing place to stay!,The hostel is one of the most beautiful hostels I've stayed in- it felt more like a hotel. We had a 4 bed female dorm. It was clean and light and the beds were quite comfortable. I really liked the individual lights and plugs. We used the roof terrace when it was sunny but it was still not warm enough to use the pool. The staff were so friendly and accommodating nothing was too much for them. We met a few other travellers one evening but it was quite laid back about social events. The hostel arranges excursions walking tours and a hammam visit.

The Central House Marrakech Medina,Karamoore wrote a review May 2018,50,Best value hostel in Marrakech,I did a LOT of research to find a good hostel within my budget in Marrakech. I narrowed it down to this riad and it did not disappoint!! The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. I felt very comfortable asking for anything I needed during my stay. I booked a walking tour through the hostel as well as a treatment at the hammam. Both services were fantastic and I was very impressed with the hostel’s recommendations. When I needed to get a taxi at 3:15 in the morning I simply spoke to the person working at the front desk the night before and they had their driver bring me to the airport for a good price. As a solo female traveller I would highly recommend this hostel. I felt very safe and met many other women travelling solo in the female dorm.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled solo,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karamoore

Gorgeous from top to bottom. Plenty of common space spread out over four floors a terrace with day beds a small pool amongst a courtyard of Islamic tilework a bar a top breakfast. Staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. Dorms weren't all that spacious though the beds were comfortable and had individual power sockets and reading lights.

The Central House Marrakech Medina,GrizzyCDG wrote a review Feb 2018,50,Magical place in Marrakech,"This was our first trip to Marrakech so we have contacted the Hostel prior our arrival to arrange transport which we think it is necessary so you can avoid high prices with cabs outside the airport.    The transfer stops 2 min walking from the Hostel because it is located in a small street and can not enter.    Once in there we have been welcomed by Ilham and Simo special thanks to these two for helping us with a smooth in and out recommending places to visit and also to eat.. ""El Haj Moustafa it's a must"" they have the best meat we had in our lives.    For couples we recommend the superior room it is perfect enough space closet huge bed really nice typical moroccan bathroom and A/c-Heater.    If it's sunny which is most of the time in Marrakech you have the swimming pool in the ground floor or the rooftop terrace which is perfect for chilling having a drink chit chatting with other travelers and having fun.    One night we had dinner in the restaurant and it was very delicious and the plates were pretty big we recommend to try it at least once during your stay.    I have to say that for the price they offer we couldn't find anything better in the city because we had plenty of things to do in the main hostel also.    Last but not least a huge thank you to Jordi the Hostel Manager for taking care of all the details he was up to everything we needed and this kind of service can not be found anywhere.

Simo and Ilham are some of the best people you will ever meet - they made me feel so at home helped with anything I needed and were just so friendly fun and lovely.    The hostel is also obviously beautiful. It is a very friendly fun hostel feel to it with a great atmosphere that makes it easy to make friends as a solo traveller or even as friends/couples travelling together but it is in the setting of a beautiful Moroccan Riad. It is so stunning it is just like one of the expensive boutique hotels around but better!    The dorm rooms are lovely the beds are comfy and have curtains on them so you can have privacy/block out the lights and each bed has it's own cute little Moroccan shelf with a lamp and a plug socket in it! The bathrooms in the dorm rooms were also BEAUTIFUL. The private rooms also looked so beautiful like amazing hotel rooms.    The food and bar was also great! The man Salah on the bar was a sweetheart and was always smiling and friendly. The staff also organised a transfer for me from the airport (for just £10) which was great and saved me lots of hassle! Also Hamza should get a mention because he was super nice too :) and the breakfast was amazing and the girl who tended to the breakfast was really sweet! I was also a bit sick with a cold and all the staff looked after me giving me boiling water whenever I needed it and generally being lovely.

The Central House Marrakech Medina,Capres T wrote a review Jan 2018,50,Safe Haven in the midst of a Crazy City,This Riad is very stunning and the staff are just wonderful. From the moment you arrive (after tackling the crazy souks) you are greeted with smiling faces clean surroundings and a comfy bed. I stayed in one of the female only dorm rooms and was very very pleased with the value for money. This Riad surpassed my expectations completely. The breakfast was good and even on the morning of my departure before breakfast had started there was coffee and cake available for a morning kick. I saw many people taking pictures of the interior and exterior of the building as it is beautiful to look at and maintained to a high standard. Also sometimes staying in Morocco bed bugs can be a problem but whilst here this did not cross my mind at all! This place is absolutely spotless!    Sadly the only negative I have to write about is the location. It is in the absolute heart of the Medina -Old Town- which seems wonderful at first...you have to weave your way through the bustling souks to find the small safe haven which is very exciting. The problem is some of the local people of Marrakech (I do not wish to generalise) do sadly see tourists as ATM machines and you are liable to become victim to scams/robbery/assault if you plan to visit the night market/explore after sunset. I have discussed this with the staff and I'm sure they are very tired of having the same conversations about this. It is a real shame as the country is very beautiful and this Riad is so so so lovely but beware (I was a solo female traveller) and often did not feel safe until I was inside the Rodamon walls!,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caprest2018

Located in the heart of the Medina close of Ben Youssef Madrassa and only 15 minutes from Jeema el-Fna has security 24h and is among the best establishments that I've been in my whole life.  Seemed to me that the hostel has been recently reformed so some doors doesn't close or open really well.
