Royal Mansour Marrakech,Kazi A wrote a review Sep 2022,50,More the Excellent truly THE BEST Place to be. Treated like a Royalty.,It is truly THE BEST Hotel I have stayed so far in my travels to over 40 Countries. Its a true Gem of Morocco & its an experience by itself. Very nice & helpful Staff. Perfect location with in minutes by car to most Marrakech Attractions.    Food is good. Riads are Beautiful & Private like your own House. Very tastefully decorated & furnished. Do keep in mind they are 2-3 storied & not all have elevator. Some have Plunge Pool on top floor & very nice sitting area.    Breakfast was included & was Excellent with wide choice of Menu to choose from. Its Priced as Luxury so if you can afford then this should be your choice  no 2nd thoughts.,Date of stay: September 2022,,"Orlando, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/436kazia

Royal Mansour Marrakech,retnyc wrote a review Mar 2,50,Perfect trip,This was our second visit to the Royal Mansour. We had planned to come back in 2020 but everything shut down because of covid. We decided to go back to celebrate my birthday . The hotel and grounds are exquisite and beautifully maintained Even the “smallest” accommodation is a three story riad with every comfort that you can imagine. It looks like what you see in a palace or a museum Every detail is perfect the tiles the ceiling the furniture. The complimentary sweets fruit wine and flowers waiting for us in the room were lovely. The bed was very comfortable and the pillow menu has an wide selection. The tub was huge and shower was invigorating. The toiletries were of the highest quality and were replaced during the twice daily room cleaning. The breakfast was delicious - everything is brought to your table you are not going to a buffet picked over by other guests. The bread and pastry basket fresh squeezed juice and delicious coffee all wonderful. Lunch and dinner was also well prepared delicious and reasonably priced for the setting. The gym is well equipped spotless and towels water fruit and everything else you need for a great workout are provided. Both the indoor and outdoor pools sparkled and were at the perfect temperature. But what really sets the Royal Mansour apart is the staff and the service that they provide. On arrival our riad wasn’t ready and we were offered a lovely complimentary lunch. We had a few minor flaws but they were handled by M. Ayoub who resolved everything ! I mentioned my birthday and the waiters sang happy birthday at breakfast with a delicious cake. Champagne at dinner What a treat! M.Ayoub and Audrey the concierge were both incredibly kind and efficient and really made our visit perfect. In fact every single person we came into contact with was friendly warm caring concerned helpful and provided outstanding service. It was really the best birthday ever. Icing on the cake was when we had to catch our flight at 5 am and we were presented with a beautifully wrapped care package for breakfast as we got into the Bentley for the short ride to the airport. Our driver contacted the fast track guide at the airport. Absolutely the best departure from a hotel EVER! Thank you M. Ayoub and everyone at the Royal Mansour for an absolutely perfect stay. We will never forget it and can’t wait to go back!,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/retnyc

Royal Mansour Marrakech,LegendaryJ wrote a review Feb 2023,10,A den of thieves. Terrible hotel.,After what seemed like a pleasant trip in an aesthetically beautiful hotel with fabulous rooms the staff robbed us of money in riad 49.. The worst part was that the staff didn’t act shocked and made absolutely no move to help. The next morning we had to complain again and insist on seeing the manager who then came out and told us to go and report to the police because there was nothing they could do about it. They claimed to have over 500 cameras in the hotel and till today have not come back to us on their findings. They didn’t care and couldn’t pretend to. It seemed apparent that they are all in on it.,Date of stay: February 2023,,"Lagos, Nigeria",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LegendaryJ
Royal Mansour Marrakech,Nickaros S wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Magical Experience!,Prepare for a magical experience at the Royal Mansour! Mr. Jean-Claude Messant and his team create an environment of welcoming warmth absolute peace wonderment and inspiration. From the moment we were greeted at the airport (really nice ride to the hotel) during our stay and our final departure the team tended to our desires (and made it look so easy). We were able to meet Mr. Messant while waiting to be checked in. After watching documentaries on the hotel it felt like meeting a celebrity; however he made us feel like the celebrities. He took the time to sit with us and listened to our plans for my wife's birthday. On the following day of our dinner at La Grande Table Marocaine he greeted us and our friends (even though it was well past his time to retire home). They arranged an amazing table with live Moroccan Music the most delicious Moroccan cuisine and a special gift from Mr. Messant. We will never forget that dinner experience! Kudos to visionaries Chef Yannick Alleno Chef Karim Ben Baba and Chef Jerome Videau (for keeping up the high standards). If you visit Sesamo you will be amazed at Italian glass works and detailed placements of the glass art. Afternoon tea sessions will satisfy your sweet tooth and leave you with the wonder of a kid in the candy store.    If you love architecture engineering or just beautiful settings the hotel's craftsmanship (and your riad) will keep you inspired. You will see that every detail is clean beautiful and admirable. The tourist attractions in Marrakech may not even keep up. Every door seems to be a delicate puzzle of individual pieces constructed together to make a unique work. Every fixture seems to be exotic. Even the art and where it is placed in the spa seems to invoke thoughts from the artist. Feels that every part of the hotel has something different and unique to see. Take your time and enjoy the hotel grounds. You will get lost in the intricate designs and her beauty.    You will notice that the staff are always paying attention to guests and demostrate great attention to detail in their work. Bumping into Antoine Berche I felt as if I were meeting an amazing coach having felt his passion and service in training the staff. They truly become your friends during your stay. Mohammed became a friend to us all (even our friends who were not staying on the property). He was so attentative and made everyone feel so welcome that they want to return and stay at the Royal Mansour!    Warm Welcomes Attention to your desires both spoken and unspoken Absolute peace and wonderment we did not want to leave. We shall return!,Date of stay: October 2022,,"Miami, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Footprints211311

Royal Mansour Marrakech,AmericanMusafir wrote a review Jan 2023,20,"A beautiful place with unfriendly, rude, and disorganized staff, with potentially racist attitudes.",The only thing that Royal Mansour has going for it is its physical architecture. It is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful hotels one can experience. They have an excellent albeit slightly dystopian looking hammam.    However beyond that there is little to recommend. The biggest issue with the place is the attitude and behavior of the staff. Sexism toward female staff who seem to be the only ones doing actual work is openly on display. There was some behavior by the staff which seemed potentially driven by racism. It is a bit hard to say since their overall behavior was sooo bad that it might just have part of the general attitude.    So let’s start with booking. After I booked the rooms on the hotel’s own website I received an email stating that I will be required to pay 50% 21 days in advance of the actual date of reservation. I proceeded to duly pay the 50%. However a day or two after I made the payment I received an email from the hotel saying that I am required to pay the remaining amount as that is hotel policy. I asked the manager (Mohammad Attaf) to provide any evidence of this - I was not given any. I then sent him the email the hotel had sent on confirming the reservation specifically stating that only 50% needs to be paid. He response was that the email was wrong. I proceeded to pay the remaining amount as I figured pissing off the manager is not going to help.    Oh wait but there is more. I wanted to reserve an area by the pool. I took multiple emails with conflicting information from the staff to eventually make such a simple reservation. We ended up booking an area along with breakfast/lunch to be delivered there. On the days leading up to the reservation we were asked to confirm this reservation multiple times which we did. On the day of the reservation when we got to the area we were told that not only is the restaurant not open but that it wouldn’t be open for some time. Why precisely then were we asked to confirm that we will be there multiple times? We were then again told that there was a problem with the system.    We had similar experiences at their in house restaurant until my wife started speaking in Lebanese at which point things improved    During this entire time pretty much every employee we met was grumpy and looked positively miserable. If the Royal Mansour cannot treat its guests well I imagine it doesn’t bode well for its employees. The tenor of unprofessionalism seems to be set from the top by the manager.,Date of stay: December 2022,,"Blacksburg, Virginia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmericanMusafir
Royal Mansour Marrakech,Katherine G wrote a review Jan 2023,50,An royal experience,I have traveled the world and this may have been my most luxurious experience. Every detail has been accounted for. From being who made past the line at customs to the rooftop breakfasts this was an experience that should not be missed. The staff was so friendly and accommodating. They are both available at a moments notice and respectful of guests privacy. The craftsmanship is overwhelming. There must be millions of hand placed tiles and painted floors ceilings and walls. In my opinion the hotel website does not come close to describing how magical this place is. There is a sprawling garden booth indoor and outdoor pools courtyards lobby’s it goes on and on. If you are debating where to stay let the debate end here.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T5997SHkatherineg

Royal Mansour Marrakech,bmegless wrote a review Jan 2023,50,Amazing Riads and Service,My wife and 12-year old daughter stayed at the Royal Mansour for 4 nights in early January.    Overall we had an amazing stay.    The Riad we staying was unbelievable. Lots of space. Very comfy bed. My daughter had a nice bed in the downstairs living room and she liked having a lot of space and separation from her partners. The rooftop plunge pool was small amd lacked much of a view but it was a nice secluded place to be outside.    The service was amazing. Everyone was so helpful. Special shout out to the concierge especially Audrey who make several great recommendations and reservations for us.    The food was good (not great). But offered lots of variety beautiful settings and good service. One knit: one night at La Grande Table Marocaine they couldn’t make a pretty simple accommodation for my daughter which seemed odd.    Overall would highly recommend crossing this off your bucket list.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Austin, Texas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bmegless

Royal Mansour Marrakech,LoveAirplanes wrote a review Dec 2022,40,Service not impeccable,The place is magical but the service can be unreliable. It seems that the culture of service has not been well established throughout the organization. Some employees went out of their way to provide 5 stars service. For example an employee escorted us to our room when we ask for help to locate it. Yet other employees seem to require more training Here are some examples: 1) We waited 15 minutes after we finished our dinner for our plates to be cleared from the table even though the restaurant was empty 2) I received a very impolite response from one of the porters when I kindly ask him if I could take his picture 3) We misplaced the room key and we felt scolded when we asked for a replacement 4) Even though there were 3 ladies standing by the reception of the Spa doing little to nothing none of them was aware that the indoor poor facilities needed to be attended to. I had to request to please pick up the used towels and get some chairs ready for us. This is one of the most expensive hotels in town that claims to deliver impeccable service.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,Jolyon_11 wrote a review Dec 2022,40,The problem with enormous expense...,We went to The Royal Mansour for lunch and took the time to look around the hotel itself - How magnificent! I can see why it is really the King of Morocco's Chambre dotes for his guests. The decoration was spectacular in every way the staff helpful the ambience opulent and calm.    Then my husband and I went to Le Jardin for lunch and this is where my review whilst not exactly taking a nosedive becomes somewhat more critical. The prices as you would expect are eye-wateringly high for a peasant such as myself. The starters anywhere from £18 - £40 main courses going up to over £100. I started with two portions of Har Gau (£20) and then had the roast turbot ( £50.) with some baked vegetables. It was nice. It was very pleasant. The Bollinger slipped down a treat but it wasn't worth the money. It wasn't spectacular. And the service fell below the perfection I would expect at these prices.  Look this is the trouble when you set yourself up to be the apex of perfection and when you have very demanding guests such as Lawrence and I; polite but expectant alas it falls below what we would expect.  I am used to paying through the nose in London but usually walk out of wherever it may be (Zuma Roka Hakkasan etc.) feeling that that was worth it and what a lovely lunch or evening - I cannot give the same accolade to The Royal Mansour.,Date of stay: November 2022,,"Etchingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jolyon_11

Royal Mansour Marrakech,totalhoteladdict wrote a review Nov 2022,40,Good but no longer excellent,I stayed here on several occasions 4 and 6 years ago. I had great memories of an extraordinary hotel but on this occasion was disappointed to see little signs of decay in the hotel and in the service. The finishings are still as extraordinary as the first time we came. But ....  - the garden candles that used to be lit at night have been replaced with fake candles which they don't even bother to remove during the day. So you have them flickering (those whose battery hasn't emptied) during the day as well creating a very absurd scene. This might be menial but it is this kind of detail that makes a hotel like Royal Mansour even more extraordinary. And this time it wasn't.  - every floor of the private Riad has a service door. The idea is that you never see the cleaning or waiter staff walking around the grounds of the hotel. But the problem is that you can hear the staff speaking loudly behind those doors. So to be honest I think I would rather walk past a chambermaid in the garden than be lying in bed and suddenly hear loud voices and have the impression that they are inside the room even though they are behind the service door. Very unsettling.  - the spa used to be extraordinary. Now you have a non descript menu in the room which doesn't even describe every treatment. Even a mid range hotel would make the effort to explain the benefits of each massage etc.  - the relaxation room in the spa which is beautifully made with wood separations has an ugly minibar plugged in a corner on the floor. Clearly an after thought but that shows the decadence of the original exquisite service.  - we had a hamam. And we will probably never do it again at the Royal Mansour. We had tried it during our last stay and loved it. But this time it was frankly unacceptable. We lay for one hour on the hot slab of stone but the therapist was present maybe 15 minutes out of the whole hour. They quickly put whatever oil or scrub and then just left you there. Because of the echo you could here them chatting away. I have had many hamam treatments in my life and this was clearly the worst one. I suggest they go to Hotel Cap Rocat in Mallorca or to the Hamam at Sultanamet in Istambul two examples of extraordinary hamam treatments.  Royal Mansour has lost its magic. It is a very beautiful hotel and still probably the best in Marrakesh. But unless they return to the impeccable standard of years back it no longer makes my list of top five.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,France,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/totalhoteladdict

Royal Mansour Marrakech,AVDB wrote a review Nov 2022,50,Flawless,"We spent 3 nights at the Royal Mansour in October as an establishment it has somewhat restored my faith in luxury properties. I have spent so much money over the years staying at various ""top-notch"" hotels around the world only to end up feeling like a fool buying into smart marketing or worse believing some celebrity's social media post.    Royal Mansour was worth every penny. Stunning property service was flawless everywhere you turned EVERYONE greeted us with the biggest and warmest smile matched by the best service you could ever ask for our butler Karim was a dream. Food was amazing. Spa was WOAH. Never saw housekeeping but the Riad was always spotless. There was a constant supply of fresh fruits snacks drinks skincare products and fragrances! Every morning on the way to breakfast we would find a rose on our path!!! This is a place I would go back to again and again and again.    In contrast some of the other properties would have their GM greeting you upon arrival then what? Nothing else works. So what's the point?

Royal Mansour Marrakech,TLZZE wrote a review Oct 2022,50,Only about the afternoon tea,Having only a few hours in Marrakesh and wanting to do something special off the beaten path my family of 4 decided to book an afternoon tea. Being avid amateur photographers we were looking forward to the many opportunities the Royal Mansour was bound to provide.    Arriving 30 mins prior to our appointment the staff were all very friendly and accommodating In fact they were able to move our reservation to an earlier time slot which was great. This gave us an opportunity to roam around the gorgeous grounds and take pictures.    Even though we were only here for the High tea the grounds were absolute luxury. You could tell there was much attention given to the details cleanliness and upkeep of the place that lived up to its reputation and class.    High tea-the cakes and pasties were delicious the sandwiches had room for improvement and overall would rate it as good given the steep price of 450 MAD (approx 45US) per person. Servers were on point and attentive and although we found them a bit reserved they did crack a smile or talked only when you initiate the conversation.    Cons: Understandably security and privacy were very high on the radar. However it was very uncomfortable to be followed around by security as we took pictures (and they requested we do not take any pictures of people but just the grounds/settings). Videos were not allowed either and it felt at every corner around the main riad and at the restaurant we had eyes on our backs. Perhaps a bit more discretion on their part may help even with visiting guests.  Also-the lack of providing any insight on places we could visit or not visit for photos etc would have been really helpful. This is a missed opportunity gap for the hotel.    Overall this was a one-time experience but not something that would be comfortable to do again as we were made to feel like outsiders that did not belong. Unfortunate as this I am sure is a wonderful place to vacation and visit and chalking it up to a one-off circumstance.,Date of stay: October 2022,,"Oakville, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TLZZE

Service is exemplary …concierge service detailed…professional and extremely knowledgeable…. It’s hard to beat this deluxe hotel.  The two on site restaurants world class.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,RandolphPhillips wrote a review Sep 2022,10,The Marrakech Jewel is Tarnished!,The Royal Mansour continues to prove that it is still tarnished and not he jewel of Marrakech anymore. I had to question if the hotel had been sold and not belonging to the Royal Family of Morocco. This is my second stay third time experiencing some of the most unprofessional service in the hotel industry. You think I am a glutton for punishment but I give second and this being the third try to an establishment.  Our experience started from the moment we arrived at the airport and the debacle at the airport. Two Royal Mansour employees could not find our reserved pickup. Once they did they did a bit of chaotic back peddling to try to correct the mishap. Prior to arriving we arranged transportation with the hotel and was informed that we could not have the Bentley (we booked prior my best friend accepting an invitation to Marrakech) as we were traveling with 3 people which I completely understand. No one wants to experience the front seat with their knees cramped to their chin. The chauffeured Bentley experience should be done with two guests. We were confirmed by the hotel via email that another alternative would be arranged to accommodate three guests plus luggage. No one had record of this and I had to provide the email for there reference.  Arriving to the hotel begins the second disaster. We had two separate reservations in which they did not have the names correct and had two of us in a Riad that was wrong. They had all the names and information for each Riad prior to arrival. At this moment I inquired why is it that the “Kings’ Hotel” a supposed 5 star hotel cannot get there act together for a simple reservation and airport pickup and at least get the names and accommodations right. This seems to set the tone for the whole experience. At this time we questioned about returning to our usual hotel AMANJENA where they do things seamlessly. Unfortunately we had prepaid our reservation of more than $3000+ per night and staying for four nights we were locked in to this mediocre hotel experience. This should be a red flag for any future reservations. You will have no recourse but to be a the hands of the hotel.  We are escorted to our 2 bedroom Riad (our friend had a one bedroom) and met by the butler of the Riad and here we go with the third disaster. We requested for our luggage to be unpacked arrange a cocktail reception in our Riad for 7 guests. Pretty simple for a hotel of this caliber and has built their reputation you would think. Well not at the Royal Mansour. It seemed we had a trainee with no experience and could not fulfill any of our requests. Informing multiple times to the front desk with no resolutions we decide to ask room service for ice. We encounter Fadil the first staff member that seemed to know my frustrations and made everything happen to our expectations with no question and seamlessly. I asked him if he could be our butler for our stay. I called the front desk to let them know we would like Fadil to accommodate our service. This is first positive thing of our experience in the Royal Mansour. Still no one has addressed our issues from management after numerous calls.    The second day came so many excuses from a hotel with no real solutions to be offered. I don’t expect anything except the service in which I pay and expecting an elevated level of service as the Royal Mansour touts to provide. Excuses are verbiage when you are not doing your job correctly. When your establishment is owned by the King of Morocco there should be no room for excuses. We did not ask for anything above or beyond the simple things that should be accommodated with a normal hotel much less a hotel on this level. The service should be seamless and exceed expectations.    Needless to say we will return to a tried and true place where you want for nothing and service is provided that you did not even know you needed this is Amanjena Marrakech!,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Dallas, Texas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Randolph66

Royal Mansour Marrakech,okayf wrote a review Aug 2022,50,I didn't want to leave!!! But will definitely return!!,Everything about my stay here was perfect. I have been lucky enough to stay at lots of beautiful hotels around the world and this truly surpasses them all. The design is beyond spectacular: everywhere you look some detail will catch your eye or you will just be blown away by the overall impression!! Particularly the ceilings - do look up!! I ate at both the French restaurant onsite and the Moroccan restaurant and the food and service were impeccable in both. The spa deserves paragraphs to itself and goes far beyond the standard offerings. I was able to do everything from chakra balancing with singing bowls to a traditional hammam to having custom insoles fitted for my sneakers!! The concierge was also extremely helpful in suggesting things I might like to do and could not have been more efficient in setting up a wonderful program both inside and outside Marrakech!! I should add that this was my first visit to Morocco and due to unexpected circumstances I was a last minute solo traveler. Knowing that everything had been organized through the hotel concierge gave me an extra measure of confidence and I felt totally safe at all times.  Beyond the sheer stunningness of this hotel what made it absolutely unforgettable for me was the staff. From the moment I was met at the airport and fast tracked through customs I was made to feel not just welcome but genuinely warmly welcomed and at home. I have to single out my extraordinary butler Abdel Karim. If you think you don't need a butler think again!! Aside from making sure that every single little detail of my stay ran smoothly and that I always had absolutely everything I needed Abdel Karim was a pleasure to talk to and patiently answered my many questions about life in Morocco. I stayed in the 2 BR Privilege Riad and while this was a little excessive for me in my solo state it would be ideal for two couples or a family as it has a substantial amount of indoor and outdoor living space in addition to the bedrooms. This was a magical introduction to a magical country and I truly can't wait to return to both.,Date of stay: August 2022,,"Houston, Texas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/okayf1

A kinder and more helpful person cannot be found. I told her that I expect her to be the general manager of the hotel someday - she is just that smart and capable. She took our five-star experience to another level.    The spa was beautifully appointed and the services excellent. I booked a private spa room and it was totally relaxing. The Hammam experience is not to be missed as well as the Dr. Bastian pedicure.    All meals were delicious and perfectly prepared. Breakfast was excellent.

Private exclusive setting which is made even more luxurious by the personal 3-story Riads. The pool was also large and incredibly inviting.    Regarding dining the breakfast was good not great. I wished it had more local options we were getting bored of it by the 4th morning. But the service in the room was perfect. And the Moroccan restaurant where we celebrated my 50th Birthday was top-notch a taste of the country with excellent service.    Few things that could be better - we were told to arrive at the spa up to an hour early for their ""rituals"" but instead were made to wait until the massage was ready with no attention. Staff on the ground were mixed some were very engaging and friendly and others not at all.    Finally the Riads by design can be quite dark with zero views - our bedroom felt like sleeping in a cave which some people might like but I prefer to wake up to the sun.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,RandolphPhillips wrote a review Nov 2021,10,The Jewel of Marrakech is Tarnished!,This is my fourth time to Marrakech my third time to the Royal Monsour. It was to be a Birthday celebration spending 2 weeks in Marrakech. First stop is my “Second Home” Amanjena spending 10 days. I wanted to introduce my mother to the Royal Monsour as she is a Queen; it was fitting and expected to have her an experience she would remember for a liftetime.  We booked RM through American Express Centurion Black Card. We arrived in Marrakech on October 29th checked in to Amanjena to a flawless experience. We have not heard anything from Royal Monsour at this point for any pre-arrival arrangements. Amanjena reached out 24 hours after our booking to ask our flight schedule Covid requirements preferences that would make our stay more enjoyable fast track upon arrival and transfers. Still not one word from Royal Monsour.  Our Incredible Butler at Amanjena (Hamza) became aware of our concern about not knowing if we actually had a reservation. He reached out to RM to ask if we had transfers (which is included with our two Premier Riad at the Royal Monsour) and the RM could not give him any information but would get back. In the meantime we reached out to the Centurion asking the same question. They too received NO RESPONSE. We are in complete shock! Spending $5000++per night and this is the service or lack there of we look forward to?  November 3 2021 got a bit concerned as we are checking-in Saturday November 6 2021 and still not one word from RM. Is this really happening? We decide we cannot chance not having a reservation they don’t know we are in Marrakech and have not given us the courtesy to welcome us give us requirements for Covid for the hotel arrival time etc. We felt very wary about this hotel so we asked our butler Hamza if we could extend our stay here at Amanjena. He could not have been more gracious in assisting us. We are able to extend a few more days but they have anther guest arriving for our Riad. He assisted us in booking a two bedroom villa at the Mandarin Oriental and went above and beyond to personally relay all our desires to make our transition smoothly.  Needless to say we cancelled our 5 day stay at the Royal Monsour as we still had not heard from them nor did American Express nor Hamza at Amanjena. Mind Blowing!  So I still wanted my mother to experience at least the common areas of Royal Monsour so I thought we could have lunch experience the spa and have dinner. Our butler Hamza arranged lunch for November 4 2021. Our Amanjena driver brought us to the Royal Monsour. We arrived to the entrance in a Mercedes S Class to the entrance at 1:30pm got out of the car at the front gate not the lobby and were met by 3 gentlemen who looked at us and asked what we were doing here. Not welcome to the Royal Monsour. I said we have reservations for lunch one says “what restaurant?” I responded I don’t remember as our butler Hamza booked the reservation. I gave our names and they looked at us and then looked at each other and spoke in their native tongue. They were extremely curt and I was waiting for machine guns to be pulled out. We were extremely uncomfortable and turned and got back in our car. Our driver was so aghast of what happened and we drove back to our hotel that welcomed us so warmly and apologized for something the Royal Monsour mishandled.  This experience has caused me to leave such a negative review that I hope future guest will pause before booking this Awful Unprofessional Disgusting Customer Service.  Consider Amanjena if you are booking Royal Monsour!

I am so thrilled that we opted to stay here finally! From the moment we were collected by the Mansour and delivered to our Riad it was just totally spoiling. We were upgraded to a three storey Riad that was just breathtaking in its layout and furnishings together with delicious treats left for us to enjoy. We had our own plunge pool on the roof of our Riad that was lovely to relax by but also loved lounging by the main hotel pool to enjoy a cocktail and the most delicious lunches. The bar in the hotel was brilliant for pre dinner cocktails and so relaxed. We had our anniversary dinner in the Italian restaurant which was unbelievably delicious and faultless it felt very spoiling and special. We always eat quite late and we were happy to see diners still arriving at 10.30pm. The breakfast was the best I have ever had in any hotel. The hotel spa and grounds are just beautiful and a pleasure to explore. What is so clever about this hotel is how brilliant the staff are at making you feel completely relaxed looked after and spoilt where nothing is too much trouble but all without you really noticing...this is not a level of service that many hotels can achieve. We cannot wait to return and I just hope it won’t be too long!,Date of stay: March 2020,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Wiltshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PoppetSouthWest

We stayed in a large private house and it was stunning with a private pool on the rooftop and a private discreet butler whom we adored and appreciated. We felt like we entered the movie Aladdin upon arrival because of how the bell men were dressed and it was so exotic! The Christmas decorations were phenomenal like royalty being welcomed.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,Marina A wrote a review Mar 2020,50,One of the best hotels in the world,The hotel is magnificent! Every detail handcrafted (almost 80% was made by hand) was jaw-dropping. The room which is actually a riad has 3 floors so you have a private living room plus powder room in one floor the room plus bathroom in another and finally your private terrace with a heated pool. The staff was so kind and helpful in every possible aspect. The spa is a chapter by itself even if you don’t want to experience the tradicional hamman you must get a massage and enjoy the beautiful architecture. Take at least one day of your stay to spend by the pool either the outdoor or the indoor the environment is perfect to relax enjoy the nice weather and have a perfect lunch at Le Jardin (the sushi was delicious). For dinner you have 3 options so you better book at least 3 nights moroccan italian and french/international cuisine. We booked the moroccan and italian and it was delightful.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,Brutally honest with an accent. wrote a review Jan 2020,40,High end but...,"Decided to visit this high end hotel as it was suggested for drinks and dinner. The highly praised & priced hotel had some really beautiful moments but most of them where a clash of bad taste & confusing decor. Seems like the decorator could not make up his mind & remain with a theme. This beautiful location could be 10 times better specially for the price it is. The staff is great friendly & welcoming. The bar & drinks were great as well. The Moroccan restaurant lacked a lot of personality & atmosphere. Again the staff & service were great & the food eventhough not the best meal we've had was really good. The problem with ""fancy"" places like this is that the miss their true culture & start to feel like a theme park hotel in Disney or Vegas.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,SteeleB09 wrote a review Jan 2020,50,One of my Favorites,Stayed here for the first time on business and had nothing but positive experiences. We stayed in a 2-bedroom Riad and it was just amazing how much space we had. But if you don’t like stairs you might want to look into making sure that isn’t an issue in your accommodation. From check in to check out the service was very good. We needed a ride to a restaurant one night. No problem complimentary hotel car service. The property is ideally located for exploring on foot walking distance to the Medina. But when you are on property you wouldn’t know you are in the city. Very quiet and secluded. Spent a few hours at the pool. It was very nice and with great poolside service.  Perhaps my favorite part of the stay was breakfast. Started with a selection of pastries and warm Moroccan breads. They had a variety of homemade jams and butters including a warm homemade peanut butter that was to die for. Everything was fresh and tasty. A little slow at times but if you are in a hurry just let them know. In short I would go back in a heartbeat.,Date of stay: November 2019,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Heber City, Utah",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteeleB09

Royal Mansour Marrakech,Eruch1 wrote a review Dec 2019,50,An Experience for the Ages,I have had the good fortune to travel widely and stay at some excellent properties. However as I entered the Royal Mansour I instantly realized that this was going to be beyond spectacular.    The level of craftsmanship across the entire property is unmatched in the quality of materials and workmanship. Fully ablaze in holiday decorations inner courtyard was breathtaking.    After a brief tour of the main building we were escorted to our riad (#25) and were walked through the amenities across all 3 levels. This riad was 1500 sq feet with an inner courtyard sitting area guest bathroom and kitchenette on the ground level. Bedroom and en-suite bathroom on the level above. The top level had a plunge pool fireplace and lounging chairs. I have added some pictures below which will not do proper justice but enough to provide perspective. As a special touch the hotel provided me with personalized stationery with my name embossed in gold leaf in case I felt like penning a letter. This attention to detail emphasizes this hotel's tremendous attention on the guest experience. The bed and linens were high-end and very comfortable. The showers are great too! The riads are all serviced from rear doors at each level and hidden tunnels by the staff. Any request was promptly executed.    During our stay we ate poolside at Le Jardin Sesamo (Italian) and Moroccan restaurants. The food was exceptional and the service was very personal and extremely accommodating to any request. The cocktails were delicious too.    The hotel has a wonderful fleet of Bentleys and Range Rovers to whisk you around.    Of course at any hotel the team are a pillar of excellence and the staff at Royal Mansour did not disappoint. Warm friendly courteous helpful welcoming efficient are just some of the words that come to mind. Our guest relations manager Yassine Quassir was beyond excellent. He was always available extremely helpful with all arrangements had great tips on what to do and where to go.    This stay was by no means inexpensive but when I think of the experience and memories; I feel confident that it will stay with me for ages...,Date of stay: December 2019,,"Boston, Massachusetts",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eruch1
Royal Mansour Marrakech,naplesinsider1 wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Actual Palace - Far above 5 star standards,This place is called the Royal Mansour for a reason. It used to be a palace. This place is one of the best ever because of the nice room service and food.  Our room was very nice. First our room had a cool fountain in the middle. Second it was very ornate. Third our bedrooms were very good looking. Fourth the food was outstanding. In conclusion the room was grand.  The service was outstanding especially our personal butler Mamadou. Food was Michelin star caliber and overseen by a 3 star Michelin chef.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,Marc Ko wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Excellency throughout. Must stay.,I travel all over the world because of my business and I can say with great confidence that the Royal Mansour in Marrakech Morocco is one of the best if not the best hotel experiences one can have either on business or vacation. The three floored riad with spacious rooms will give you plenty of space and privacy along with perfectly managed gardens and facilities. Also Mohammad (I hope I’m spelling his name right) at the restaurant was just amazing with great personality and services that would make anyone feel great about the day to come. He took time to explain about the Moroccan foods and his hometown Berber and his impeccable service was far from machine-like services filled with superficial mannerisms that you may experience from five star+ hotels from time to time. His friendly yet professional services were just so pleasant.    Overall I’d highly recommend staying at the hotel and enjoying the facilities here that the royal family owns.

We chose the champagne afternoon tea at 750 MAD.    It was very disappointing. The cakes arrived first and eventually after waiting 15mins we asked for the savoury platter. Afternoon tea is usually savoury followed by sweet. We had four tiny sandwiches each which were very disappointing and all in sweet brioche bread.    Then we had a dessert each which was chosen for you. I had white chocolate my friend dark and another table had a Mille feuille.    There was little atmosphere and 3 other tables.  In afternoon tea terms it wasn’t good and it wasn’t deserving of a hotel of that calibration - coupled with the fact the shop was open but no one to serve and yet many many staff standing around.

A wonderful location with easy access to the souks (we recommend using WithLocals for an intro tour to get comfortable with them).    We dined in all locations and enjoyed them all over the top. We did find the amount of breakfast served ridiculously large so much wasted food which was disappointing. We would suggest they find a way to get a better sense of how much food the guests want before serving.    Spa was lovely an enjoyable hammam for me and my husband reported his best massage ever unfortunately his manicurist took a chunk of skin off one finger so that pretty much ruined the rest of his spa experience.    It is difficult when a property has such strong accolades (99 on AH list) and you have high expectations walking in that are not fully met although I still rated the property as excellent as it really is. Many staff delivered superior service. With that said there were several lapses in communications and service over our four days that if they had been handled well would have dramatically improved our experience (which I believe is what the RM is trying to achieve). At this price point it does come down to those small details.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,James C wrote a review Aug 2019,30,A lot of hype for no reason.,"We ended our luxury hotel trip by two nights at the Royal Mansour and to be completely honest we ended it on a lackluster note as this was by far the worst ""luxury"" hotel in Marrakech we stayed at.    The hype is real with this one we stayed in a luxury riad the top ones with the ""pool"" the riads are extremely small and laid out with 4 flights of stairs (no lift available). The bath is almost as big as the ""pool"" and it is a small bath.    The hotel is very noisy even at night and the beds are extremely uncomfortable. The sheets felt like wax paper with all the starch put on them and they are of inferior quality. Whilst the hotel looks rich a closer look shows that all the inlaid wood is faux workmanship with no real workmanship. And although I might understand this is not probably common in all the riads ours was full of ants (including on the bed). Not to mention the SMELL !!! the smell inside the riad was horrible like a musky (old room) smell.    When we grabbed the attention to the top points at reception we just got a ""meh"" in return. As expected the drink and food is extremely expensive but also here the bistro we tried seems like it can't decide what type of cuisine it wants to be with an effort in being a thai/japanese/med fusion but failing on the taste it delivers.    There are no luxury items available at the hotel this is where it gets confusing. This hotel offers nothing which can't be obtained from everywhere else just at 10x the price. The same brand of beluga caviar which in London cost me €150 in the Royal Mansour they are charging €660 for it.    As I said very disappointed the royal Mansour is a typical tourist trap promising luxury and delivering nothing in return except for high prices for common items.",Date of stay: August 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C2839ALjamesc

Royal Mansour Marrakech,Claire Higgon wrote a review Aug 2019,50,An absolute dream of a hotel,My mother and I have just returned from a two night three day stay at this absolutely wonderful hotel.    I booked their 'short break' offer which means for the standard two night price there are some lovely extras included - spa treatments riad upgrade and dinner at La Grande Table Morrocaine . It's certainly not a cheap place to stay and nor should it be for what they're offering I believe its great value for money.    Everything about this hotel is flawless here's what we loved:  - Being met at the airport minutes after getting off the plane and being whisked through security. The team who met us even completed our immigration cards. Nothing is too much for the team even before you arrive at the hotel.    - The short return transfers to and from the hotel in their Bentley made us feel like royalty.    - The employees that we met throughout our stay. I'd like to specifically call out the team at the swimming pool. The iced smoothie we were served every day upon arrival their smiley welcome when we arrived at the pool as soon as they saw us they were there to help us get comfortable in our preferred spot and made sure we always had an ice bucket full of water bottles at our beds. After the first day they realised we loved floating on the pool bean bags and they were offered to us as soon as they saw as heading towards the water. Also Mohammed Adil in the concierge team - he is an absolute asset to this hotel and really made us feel looked after with the arrangements he made for us and looked after my mum.    - The spa was beautiful and the hammam treatments were the best I've ever had anywhere in the world.    - The Privelege Riad - spacious beautiful comfortable luxurious stunning - there are not enough words that can do the Riads and the rest of the hotel justice. The tiles the woodwork the upholstery the gardens - every corner of this hotel is stunningly beautiful and immaculately kept. The beautiful fire places the multiple dressing rooms in our Riad the private plunge pool Netflix on all of the TV's the yoga mat provided in the bedroom the morrocan products provided in the bathroom a bathtub big enough to swim in. The way the staff can enter and leave so discretely.    - The food at the hotel is delicious from breakfast in our riad and at le Table restaurant to the food we ate beside the pool and the special dinner we ate at La Grande Table Morrocaine. Dining experiences at this hotel are on another level.    - We were made to feel so special the reason for the trip was to celebrate my mothers 70th birthday. She has had trouble walking recently and the hotel ensured they gave us a Riad with a lift so she didn't have to navigate the stairs between the 3 floors. The special birthday dessert at the fine dining restaurant on our first night and the team singing happy birthday to her. The personalised stationary the welcome goodies. The fresh little cakes left in our riad every day.    - One of our daily highlights was retiring to our Riad late in the afternoon and ordering mint tea to be taken in our Riad living room.    This hotel is a total oasis and we were so sad to have to leave. What makes this place so special outside of all the things described above is that the experience is truly Moroccan. There are plenty of amazing 5* hotels in the world that are beautiful and offer amazing service however this hotel is so true to Marrakesh and the country in which its located it made our stay just that little bit extra special.    I would probably go as far as saying I've finally found a hotel that knocks my favourite hotel of all time Le Bristol in Paris off its top spot.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,Tamar wrote a review Aug 2019,50,Pure Magic,It has taken me a little while to even write this review as words cannot describe just how perfect this hotel is.  Each room in this boutique hotel is its own riad with a beautiful courtyard. Every architectural details is meticulously thought out and executed to perfection. Staying here is an experience for all of your senses: small orange groves surround you with a heavenly fragrance and small water streams add soothing sounds to your stroll. The staff is so warm friendly and helpful and the food so delicious that you will never want to leave this beautiful resort. This hotel is a whole new level of luxury and Marrakesh itself is a must-see destination.,Date of stay: April 2019,,"Toronto, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TROYT50

Royal Mansour Marrakech,THE TRAVELLER wrote a review Jul 2019,50,Hotel with no bedrooms or suites !,Yes- thats right. No bedrooms or suites but a series of individual Riads each with their own rooftop plunge pool ! ROYAL by name and more- this place was a 'concept' of the King of Morocco himself. No money has been spared to deliver an ultimate get away experience. - which starts before you arrive as they fast track you through airport security to a waiting hotel car ! Design is very traditional - the very best of material and fabrics have been used to create a stunning environment. Staff to customer ratio is high but you dont always see the staff who move around premises in a series of hidden corridors and tunnels! The grounds are just beautiful- manicured and fragrant. Whole range of dining options and menus as you would expect. Stay at the Royal Mansour and you will be treated like Royalty. Obviously this all comes at a price and expect to pay €1200+ per night.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,SPEXX wrote a review Jul 2019,50,Exceptional experience!,We booked this trip to celebrate my 50th birthday and also my wife’s and my 21st wedding anniversary. There was a limited window for us to visit Marrakech so we had just 3 nights all spent in the wonderful Royal Mansour.    This is a very long review so be prepared - I hope it’s useful.    As part of the stay at the hotel they organised fast-track through security at the airport. All Royal Mansour guests get this I think. As we came through towards passport control a lady held an iPad out with our name on and took us through a separate passport channel. She indicated that doing this probably saved about an hour in the main passport control because the evening flights into Marrakech arrive at a similar time apparently. The fast-track lady (sorry can’t think of a different title) then waited with us until we collected our luggage then came through the luggage security check and finally out to meet up with the driver from Royal Mansour who was waiting outside of customs.    Our driver Zacharia then escorted us to the waiting Bentley Spur. Wow what a car! Real luxury and great way to travel the short (15mins) drive to the hotel. The driver was very chatty and answered a few initial questions we had on the way.    The hotel entrance is spectacular as is everything else about the hotel. It truly is a stunning property. The quality and detail in every part is beyond compare. The property was (I believe) conceived by the King and he owns the property - it really is palatial but at the same time has a relaxed atmosphere.    We were met by Ayoub who then gave us a very brief tour of the main areas of the hotel. It was night time but everything is lit so beautifully. He led us to our Superior Riad where they had arranged for a lovely bottle of red wine for us with chocolates sweets and fruit as a way of celebrating my birthday/anniversary. Ayoub had a great manner and couldn’t have done a better job of welcoming us. He even asked if red wine was okay for us - I mentioned that my wife isn’t a big fan of red wine so he offered champagne instead and in the end said we should keep the red wine too.    The riad (#7) was incredible. I think they all have three levels. On the ground floor there was a huge lounge area with fireplace (not used because it was July but must be wonderful if you come in the winter). They had left personalised stationery which was a classy touch. No mention of it just left for us to find. There is a separate kitchen area on the ground floor with a fridge sink and coffee machine etc with a good supply of free still water which was replenished every day which we really appreciated. There is also a loo on that floor.    Upstairs to the first floor was the bedroom and bathroom. The whole room had been sprinkled with rose petals and there was a heart of petals on the bed and candles up the stairs - a lovely surprise. There was loads of wardrobe space in both the bedroom and elsewhere. The room was big but cosy. Aircon and lighting all digitally controlled from a panel on the wall - worked perfectly. The bathroom was gorgeous with very nice complementary shampoo/creams etc. There was a walk in shower alongside a deep bath. So much beautiful detail in the tile and stone work.    Finally another flight of stairs up to the roof terrace where we had two loungers under an umbrella a table and chairs and a plunge pool. I’m sure some of the riads have views; we didn’t but that wasn’t an issue for us.    We arrived late so were quite hungry and tired. We decided to go to Le Jardin restaurant which is situated behind the pool area. It primarily serves asian food in the evening and we actually went twice during the stay and the food was great both times as was the service.    Breakfast every day was very excellent. Full table service. Lots of choice and very good quality. Service was a little hit and miss - everyone tried very hard and were very polite at all times but occasionally ordered items took a while to arrive or were forgotten. We were very relaxed about it but it probably could be a little slicker to be up to the exceptional standards of everything else.    We used the concierge a few times. They were always efficient and helpful; providing maps and guidance on where to visit and booking restaurants/cabs etc when needed.    We had pre-booked the day trip to the Atlas Mountains which was a highlight for us. This was a private tour run by the hotel. Our driver Akram was absolutely fantastic. He was great to talk to throughout the day. Very attentive and always keen to ensure that we were comfortable and getting what we wanted from the trip. He has been with the hotel from day one and it showed. I won’t go into detail on then trip but we stopped off at a Berber village for moroccan tea. The berber house was great and you got a glimpse of their lifestyle etc which was very interesting. He knew the owner and they clearly knew and liked him. TIP - have some change with you to give to the owner as a thank you.    In the same village was a cooperative that supported widows and divorcees. They make Argan oil the traditional way along with other products. It’s interesting but in all honesty mainly centred around selling a variety of their products. We didn’t mind this; it felt like a good cause and my wife had actually wanted to buy some argan oil during the trip so this was a good opportunity. We also stopped at a berber carpet/rug cooperative. Again this was interesting but this a bit of soft sell so be aware. Actually the rugs are beautiful but we simply wouldn’t have had anywhere to put one!    The rest of the the trip is winding through mainly smooth mountains roads on the way to our lunch spot that we had arranged at Kasbah Tamadot. This is Richard Branson’s hotel in the mountains. I will try and get around to doing a separate review of our lunch there but it was excellent. On the way back after lunch we took a more direct route so better roads and much quicker.    The trip is not cheap at all but you’re essentially hiring a driver and top spec Range Rover for the day. Had we not have had to get back for the Spa we could have taken a detour to a lake in the mountains. I’m sure it would have been brilliant but someone else will have to tell us. Overall a great day out. As I said Akram was great. Full of information and always a smile on his face.    The Spa is beautiful! It is separate from the main building and beautifully designed. My wife had a Signature Hammam which she loved and really wanted to experience for the first time while we were in Morocco. I had a back and shoulder massage which was great. There is a relaxation room to spend time in afterwards which is fantastic and I presume if you really wanted you could use the indoor pool etc. We didn’t.    We were unsure what we would do on our final day because check-out was noon and our flight was at 7.45pm. I had sent an email prior to our stay asking whether it was possible for a late check-out but they weren’t able to confirm. When we checked on the morning of our departure a manager there on duty confirmed that we could have the riad until we were due to leave at 5.45pm. This may have been an easy decision for him but was amazing news for us and we were thrilled. It meant we could really enjoy our last day to the full. After a brief trip into the souks we then spent a few hours at the pool.    The pool is beautiful. I heard a couple of people comment how much better it was than the pool at La Mamounia. The staff were attentive but weren’t constantly pushing you for drinks which you can find in some hotels. The water was a perfect temperature and it was a very peaceful time. We had lunch there which we enjoyed. We had some sushi rolls and a burger; very nice.    The hotel had arranged for our transport to the airport again. Akram saw us in reception shortly before departure and decided to surprise us by deciding to work beyond his normal hours and take us to the airport. He wanted to make it extra special so arranged to take us in the property’s red and silver Bentley Mulsanne (?). This was so thoughtful of him and typical of the quality of the staff at the hotel. More impressive because we knew that this was his final day before his holiday. We felt like royalty - thank you again Akram.    The final thing to mention is that you also get the fast-track treatment on the way out. Again we were met by a fast-track lady who took us through the various security checks and made the whole experience a lot more pleasurable than it would normally be.    In summary this hotel is incredible. It is one of a kind and made our short trip to Marrakech so special. It exceeded our expectations in almost every way. It goes without saying that this is not a cheap option. There are clearly many very good hotels and riads in Marrakech that you could choose to stay in. For this special occasion I believe that we chose the best there is. Not only is the hotel beautiful in design and the detail but the service is exceptional and the all of the staff went out of their way to make our stay the best it could possibly be.    If you decide to do Marrakech in style you really should stay at the Royal Mansour.,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Esher, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SPEXX

Royal Mansour Marrakech,aprotraveler wrote a review Jun 2019,50,A Palace Built for a King!,Royal Mansour -This property represents great value by relative standards. All the rooms are massive multi room suites with pools and large entry courtyards. The Kingdom of Morocco developed and owns the property about 8 years ago. It is located just inside the medina. The King commissioned all the best old world artisans to create every detail of the property and did a stunning job of replicating old world hospitality with all the modern conveniences.    The staff to guest ratio is enormous and I doubt many properties have similar horsepower running the joint. What is so interesting is that all of the staff move about the resort through a series of behind the scene underground corridors and tunnels so they are rarely seen.    The swimming pools spa and restaurants are off the charts on virtually all fronts. I would go so far as to say if you are an ultra-hotel snob it is worth a trip to Marrakesh just to take it in. We toured the property including the massive gardens and had lunch by one of the pools after seeing a couple rooms and much of the common space. The food on offer was diverse and marvelous and the service and décor were as good as it gets. Just to give you a sense for the menu there was everything from traditional Moroccan Tangine to Sushi to burgers to pasta. And the deserts would make any French pastry chef asking for baking tips.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,New York City,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aprotraveler

Royal Mansour Marrakech,Speaks32 wrote a review Jun 2019,40,Afternoon Tea,I adore the Royal Mansour Hotel and when I visit I like to book in for afternoon tea and drinks. I emailed prior to travelling to Marrakech requesting an afternoon tea at 5:30pm ( serves from 3:30pm- 5:30pm) my email confirmation came back that I was booked in at 5pm.    I arrived at 4:55pm and informed i was booked in. I was left in the hallway whilst someone went to get assistance.    I was then told I was late and that they stop serving afternoon tea at 5:30pm and I was booked in for 3:30pm. I explained that my confirmation was for 5pm not 3pm. I was told that I was mistaken and they too had email confirmation and was booked in at 3:30pm. I was upset and asked if I should leave. I sat in the bar and was then told as I was now here I could have afternoon tea. By this point I was upset and made to feel unwelcome.    The gentlemen who served me my tea were lovely and very friendly but I was still upset. I asked for the WiFi code and checked my email confirmation. It was booked for 5pm!!! I showed this two two members of staff who said not to worry. However I was not apologised to for being made to feel stupid.    I did enjoy my afternoon tea but felt a little awkward and as I was dining alone I still felt upset and asked to take away the remainder of my cakes.    I wanted to purchase from the boutique but had to ask for someone to assist me. Sadly they couldn’t find what I wanted despite there being one in the cabinet by this point I just wanted to leave without further fuss.    The staff who waited on me once I was being served tea were lovely and very attentive if it wasn’t for them I would have left. The hotel is stunning and the afternoon tea a real treat and a nice way to relax after a long day.    This is my 3rd visit to Royal Mansour. I would normally review with 5 stars.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Cheltenham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Speaks32

I wrote the hotel in advance as I wanted to surprise him with some special things.    First we went to the gorgeous bar for pre- dinner drinks that was so special. Thank you to Yassine for your wonderful service. I ordered a rum and pineapple drink and it was served in a gold ornate pineapple! Wow!    We were then given a great tour by Safah in Guest Relations who explained the history of the hotel and showed us around explaining everything in great detail. The Royal Mansour should be on everyone's list when they go to Marrakech.    You can go for a drink lunch or dinner. It is beyond belief! Commissioned by the King of Morocco- it took 1000 people 7 years to build. The architecture is so stunning with gold and marble etc. Nothing was spared when building this hotel.    It is also a people watching place just sitting in the lobby or bar.    The staff in the hotel are all dressed in Moroccan costumes and of course also in the restaurant. Our waitress Robia was the best. She was so attentive to us and provided impeccable service.    Before dinner she brought to our table a silver pitcher to pour water over our hands ( to clean them) -over a silver bowl. What an experience!    We started off with the Moroccan Salads and then had a chicken dish and a fish dish. All delicious and presented on beautiful china.    The wine and water glasses were all ornate crystal. Everything was over the top- Opulent!    Many of the staff at the restaurant including Robia came out and surprised my husband and sang to him Happy Birthday in two languages.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,gamogirl wrote a review May 2019,10,Pure aesthetics over genuine service and quality,"Went for spa lunch drinks and shopping over course of several days. Well-dressed with luxury signifiers of jewelry and handbags to appear ""worthy"" of at least decent service Treated best when we arrived in luxury car with driver but still felt like third class guests.    Once inside hotel staff ranged from indifferent to outright rude! Impossible to find someone to direct you seat you or serve you. Clearly the staff has been told to disregard outside guests to focus solely on internal clients. Although this may sound appropriate overall why allow outside visitors instead of purposely treating them poorly? Were told there were no tables for lunch one time and dinner another time when both restaurants were empty (other reviews mention this too). Food was underwhelming too. Had to walk around bar area for several minutes to find help to order then again to wonder about delay in drinks and finally again to pay. Drinks were good but bitter aftertaste even lack of service.    Shout out to the haughty traditional dressed young staffer waltzing around the bar area thinking she is above her paying guests---you are truly one of the most rude uncaring and unprofessional people in over 20 years of luxury hotel stays--this is not the career for you. Very poorly reflects on hotel of this supposed royal caliber.    Spa is beautiful but not functional. Lobby also serves as wait area when you are robed--who wants to be exposed like that?! Lockers were tricky to operate and front desk staff switches out every few minutes so took over half hour to get someone to help open the stuck lock! Post massage area is again lovely to look at but took several minutes of wandering outside to find someone to bring the tea. At first the staff asked if we could just drink water instead as the tea pot was empty--ummh no! Not at these prices and supposedly level of luxury. Massage was worst I have had in many years-- masseuse was late hurried and not well trained.    Gift shop was sad. Not enough high quality products and crafts. Sales lady did not know her stock and was preoccupied with wrapping something instead of attending to live customers.    Usual high end hotels have friendly knowledge staff that want to engage with clients--not here--which alas was general theme of our experience. Perhaps they get so many visitors they don’t want to bother but still reflects poorly on the management and leads to loss of business.

We got picked by the express security line person inside the airport and they took us to speed up the security process got to our hotel car and sent us to the hotel very promptly.    We checked into a villa that has 3 floor the first floor is living room with kitchen and a bathroom second floor is our bedroom with my wooden dream closet a full size bathroom and the third floor is a rooftop with swimming pool hang out and dining area and a bathroom also.    Everyone fall in love immediately it was just such an extraordinary place to be. We stayed at a lot of luxury places but this is another level of luxury - so rich in Moroccan craft it is literally everywhere and everything you see. They just don't buy a table or a chair someone a team of hundred of craftsman and women must have worked together days after days to create all these amazing furniture door light all these decor. Those are the things that amazed my husband and i and I still am very amazed by the display of all these flavourful objects.    The kids enjoyed the pool upstairs and we enjoyed a special meal at the rooftop celebrating a birthday with a staff magician and also a dedicated staff member to serve the meal.    We needed help for shipping some of the 5 blankets that we bought and the staff handled them very smoothly and promptly. We also dined at their Moroccan restaurant and that really add to our collection of memories for this trip.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,haagensena wrote a review Apr 2019,50,Beautiful hotel. Almost perfect.,I’ll start with the good points: the hotel is absolutely GORGEOUS. It’s quiet and the gardens are magnificent. The flowers and citrus groves fill the air with the most delicious intoxicating smell. The pick up service from the airport is amazing. The breakfast and afternoon tea would make Queen Elizabeth envious. The pool is one of the most beautiful pools I’ve been to. The fact that they bother to monogram the writing paper in your room with your name in gold letters gave me goosebumps. The concierge staff specially Aggi (? spelling) is SUPERB. The Spa is beautiful.  Now for the bad points: the Moroccan restaurant is bland and left much to be desired. The food in general is unimaginative and waaaay too expensive. Lunch for 2 at the pool was $163. Dinner at the Moroccan restaurant was close to $500 for 2 people. In comparison Dar Rhizlane in the Medina was amazing and less than half the price. The drinks at the bar were boring. We were charged $25 just to look at the list of movies on TV. The hotel store is very small and there is not a lot of merchandise to pick from. The choice of drinks at the room’s minibar also left much to be desired. The rooftop plunge pool was too cold to go in even after they supposedly heated it. Overall it’s so close to perfect that it’s a pity that the food and drinks were so expensive and subpar.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,Saltyhanif wrote a review Apr 2019,10,Afternoon tea,Absolutely stunning hotel away from the hustle and bustle of central Marrakesh. We had booked afternoon tea in advance for our group but realised once we had sat down and were giving our orders that there were very limited savoury options. We slightly adjusted our original order from 4 Moroccan and 4 English teas to 6 Moroccan and 2 English teas.  We were most disappointed in the service we received from that point onwards: having been told we could have refills of our drinks as is standard practice in every other decent to high-end afternoon tea establishment including the Dorchester Savoy etc we were told in patronising and arrogant terms that no we were wrong. The sandwiches served with the English tea were measly with stale bread being used in one of the sandwiches I had. Again as is standard practice for afternoon tea we asked for more sandwiches as the servings and fillings were paltry. Again we were told that we would be charged extra for them. At the end of the meal we were left with a huge amount of untouched cakes and asked for them to be packed for our driver; again we were refused in rude and patronising terms.  When one of us went to talk to the management at the reception desk she was treated with rudeness and arrogance again ( being talked over and reprimanded for “raising her finger”). I certainly won’t be returning to this hotel as the attitude of most of the staff was so arrogant.    Plus points: 1) there was one lovely member of staff who was most friendly and accommodating patiently taking group photos of us. 2) beautiful design and interiors; really stunning environment ( although again we were told upon arrival that we could not walk around all the grounds).,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saltyhanif

The staff are wonderfully trained and are there to make sure that your experience is flawless. Imagine having a private three story riad probably the equivalent of 10 fabulously appointed rooms complete with your own rooftop pool and lounge area! Apartment servicing is done with a system of underground tunnels so that you never see anybody! It’s magic!  The grounds are kept in perfect order as if you are in a private botanical garden. The king built this property and regularly entertains here. Special thanks to Abdullah Mohammed and Yaseen.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,Tfb2018 wrote a review Apr 2019,10,Truly shocking service for such a ‘top’ hotel,Had afternoon tea booked in advance for a friend’s big birthday with 7 other ladies from London. One of our group asked if there were free refills for tea and coffee. The maitre d’ clearly said yes. Later we asked for the refill and were denied by the manager. When we reminded him what his staff member had said he replied ‘I’m pretty sure he didn’t say that’... ! We all heard the opposite. It wasn’t the fact that the refill was denied (but really - how much would it have cost them to provide more tea coffee ??) but the ATTITUDE of the manager  not taking into account 8 guests hearing his staff give inaccurate information. The foolish maitre d’ was a coward and denied he’d ever said yes.  We would have valued an apology of communication inaccuracy instead of sheer arrogance and brushing off guests.    If you come here for tea be aware: there is abundance of sweet stuff but not enough savoury - ridiculously tiny sandwiches in the English Tea and no refill (but that was made clear when we asked so we have no issue with this communication).    The Moroccan Tea has no savoury option and the whole thing can be a bit of sugar rush. We all have a sweet tooth but were craving something savoury.    The most disappointing thing from our visit was simply the service of the manager and his maitre d’ who made a mistake but were not responsible enough to own up to their shortcomings. I would not come back and instead find another hotel with less arrogance.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,mollyms619 wrote a review Mar 2019,50,A Dream Come True,We have been lucky enough to have stayed at some of the best hotels in the world but none have been able to match the level of design luxury and service of the Royal Mansour. The moment we were picked up by their driver in a Bentley we knew we were in for a treat and our expectations continued to be exceeded from there.    The hotel itself is beyond stunning. The level of design and craftsmanship is so much beyond a five-star hotel - I would liken it more as the opportunity to live in a historic royal palace (such as Alhambra). Everywhere you turn are gorgeous details - from the staff's wardrobe to the light fixtures to the textiles to the glassware in the dining room. It is truly a showcase of the best of Moroccan design.    The grounds are vast lush and beautiful. We visited during spring and were greeted by hundreds of orange trees covered in fruit and the most intoxicatingly fragrant blossoms. The pool is amazing - massive and gorgeous. Although the hotel was at capacity it never felt crowded or loud - a true oasis from the chaos of Marrakech. The spa was incredible - a hammam is a must if anything just to witness the gorgeous spa suite. The individual riads are all laid-out to replicate the medina - meaning it's easy to get lost but that's half of the fun!    Each 'room' consists of a three-story riad that is truly more beautiful and luxurious than words can describe. All of the amenities are so thoughtful. We loved having two wood-burning fireplaces (just a quick phone call and a riad butler would be there to light it) and felt so incredibly comfortable and relaxed. My favorite element was our private rooftop where we swam ate dinner and sat by the fire.    The staff at Royal Mansour are truly amazing - we have never felt more taken care of and valued. Every single person we came across during our stay from the groundskeepers to the housekeeping to restaurant staff always greeted us with a big smile. Nothing was too much to ask. Their concierge team helped us plan the most incredible five-days in Marrakech. It's so incredibly obvious how much pride each staff member takes in their job and is truly in my opinion what makes the Royal Mansour so special.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,samyj87 wrote a review Mar 2019,50,The ultimate luxury experience!,I was really looking forward to staying at the Royal Mansour and then I had the misfortune of getting sick the night before we checked in. But if there is a place to be sick it’s the Royal Mansour. The staff are so kind and helpful and provide the best service we have ever received. They have a nurse onsite and an on-call doctor. Not to mention I was “confined” to a huge luxurious riad :)    Aside from the healthcare services that most people won’t take advantage of the architecture decor food service people landscape etc. are absolutely amazing. It’s a modern day palace that goes above and beyond for the ultimate experience. We got an outstanding breakfast served on our rooftop terrace every morning walking through the grounds were so beautiful and peaceful. All of the staff knew our names and would even ask how I’m feeling... almost creepy. Almost.    It’s so simple to book tours with the concierge and they provided a great convenient USD to MAD conversion. From the decor to the staff the attention to detail is beyond anything I have seen before. Worth every penny!    The only note I would make is that this place may not be completely suitable for the elderly or handicapped. Our riad was 4 floors and although we didn’t mind going up and down those stairs all day my parents would have had some issues. Certain riads are offered with elevators but they said it’s not guaranteed unless it’s a larger and of course more expensive one.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samyj87
Royal Mansour Marrakech,MaryKay519 wrote a review Feb 2019,50,Fit For a King...Literally!,From the minute we drove up to the entrance to our departure 3 days later with multiple staff members waving us farewell our experience at the Royal Mansour was incredible. To begin the hotel is situated inside the walls of the Medina making exploring very easy which was the primary reason we initially selected this property. However the hotel itself was so amazing that there were times I had no interest in actually leaving the grounds. Our room was a riad and consisted of 3 floors - the lower floor had 3 living spaces a powder room and a mini kitchen. In the middle was our spacious bedroom several closets and dressing rooms and a fabulous bathroom and to top it off on the 3rd floor we had our own private pool fireplace and reclining area overlooking the rest of the property. All of the rooms were beautifully appointed and exhibited spectacular tile work. Morocco at its best. Breakfast was included in our accommodations and one day we took advantage of dining in our room with the fire lit...what a way to start the day. When dining in the breakfast room itself the offerings are wide and plentiful - eggs fruit moroccan tangines etc. You will definitely be sated! Be sure to explore the beautiful grounds filled with lemon and orange trees. Sadly we did not have enough time to lounge by the pool and eat at the restaurant poolside...but it looked amazing. I could go on and on about how lovely the property was...but turning my attention to the staff - they could not have been more engaging warm delightful and helpful. From our initial greeting to the virtually invisible people who delivered ice pillows etc. while kudos to their training I can't help but think that the Moroccans are just naturally welcoming and wonderful. Without question we will return to Marrakech and when we do we will return to the Royal Mansour...counting the days starts now!,Date of stay: February 2019,,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryKay519
Royal Mansour Marrakech,AKD wrote a review Feb 2019,40,Brilliant service but the Food sometimes let it down.,"Staying at the Royal Mansour was an amazing experience with brilliant service staff and accomadation. the service was wonderful and you would call up reception to do this that or something else and a couple of minutes later sombody would come through the service door to the rescue. One thing that wasn't so good is that occasionally when you called someone to come and light the fire it would take them a very long time. For example on a late wednesday afternoon it took him more than an hour to turn up.  The room was full of amazing detail and everytime you walked through the door you couldn't help but look around and go "" wow."" the room was clean and there was absolutely no dust anywhere the floors were spotless and the windows looked non-existent they were so clean. the resources within the room were great within loads of things to eat or snack on. the only thing within the room that was a little annoying is that the TV didnt really work. Occasionally it would disconnect itself from and we would have to sort it. The food was usually good with breakfast in the main restaurant and lunch in 'le jardin' being brilliant. Dinner some nights was a bit of a let down. Twice the meat was either a bad cut becoming chewy and fatty or undercooked meaning that we had to send it back. Other than this it was a brilliant stay and a hotel that i would definitely return to.",Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happiesttravelling15
Royal Mansour Marrakech,ryu0803 wrote a review Feb 2019,50,Magical,Staying at the Royal Mansour was an unforgettable experience. The hotel was stunning and there were more to see inside the hotel than in the Marrakech Museum. There was exquisite craftsmanship on every wall and at every corner. Every room was different and they were all gorgeous.    Owned by the King we were given the royal treatment being the guests here. Service started the moment we arrived Marrakech. We were met soon after we got off the plane and we were escorted through immigration and customs. We arrived the hotel with a team of staff waiting at the entrance showing their welcome. Staff we met during our stay were very friendly and courteous. Everyone was there to make sure we were enjoying our stay. Concierge was responsive and attentive to details. All our activities were perfectly arranged before our arrival. We had a great time touring the beautiful city in the hotel Bentley with an experienced tour guide.    We stayed for 2 nights and our 2 bedrooms riad was elegant and spacious. There were separate entrances for the staff to use and they appeared very soon after we called for service. We had the hamman treatment at the beautiful spa and it was an interesting Moroccan experience. Food was very good at the hotel. We had lunch at Le Jardin dinners at La Table and La Grande Table Marocaine. We enjoyed all our meals especially the Moroccan restaurant with the 1001 nights ambience. Service at the restaurants was impeccable.    We highly recommend this hotel for a unique Moroccan stay. Just do not visit the hotel for meal only.

From the beginning to the end Ithese have been dreamlike holydays in this palace. Everything starts with the welcome service in the airport with a fast track passport control which is just priceless considering how long I would have wait in the queue line. The pick up in Bentley car was just the perfect detail to tell more of what you can expect in this hotel. My room I should rather say my home was just beyond any expectation: a personnal 3-floors Riad of 140 sqm !! Everything is done to make you feel pampered and at home as the service is done without you can ever notice anyone.The whole hotel is inspired from Morrocan style but with a great sense of details and all the modernity you need. This property is really deserving all the awards they received !  I travel a lot and always choose high standards hotel but Royal Mansour really overcomes everything I am used to. Seems like they provide you with all you need and all you would not ever think you need.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,FlyinFinn1 wrote a review Dec 2018,50,"Superb Stay, Exceeds Expectations","For the price pedigree and reviews we expected a lot from the Royal Mansour and it lived up to all of the hype. The architecture and décor is opulent with no expense spared; every inch of the place is hand made carved stitched and cared for. I understand the hotel was constructed at the order of the king with an unlimited budget and it shows - it's quite unbelievable.    We had the best service of any hotel in the world period. They greet you by last name regularly and wait on you hand and foot literally. It's to the point of running to pull out and push in your chair replacing plates if there's a crumb carrying shopping bags to your room and having a fleet of Bentley's to take you anywhere. Plus they were accepting of us as a gay couple. We told them in advance and there was not a problem on email or in practice. We didn't advertise it with our wedding rings and PDA but they knew and were fine.    The room is crazy grand and HUGE. Too big in fact for one couple to use. We didn't know what room to use on any given day. However people should know it is designed like a traditional Moroccan riad which means it's broken up into different rooms and many levels with a lot of stairs. It's also dark but for a reason as riads are designed with few windows to keep heat out and emphasize introversion and privacy. We loved this cozy feel but I know (and heard) one American who didn't like it as Westerners often prefer lighter décor and more open floor plans. We enjoyed this style for when experiencing Moroccan culture. I will say though that the first floor living room felt a little like a nice hotel lobby perhaps a bit impersonal. We spent most of our time in the second floor wood paneled bedroom which was gorgeous.    The food is absolutely delicious here. We didn't have a bad meal. The breakfast buffet is sumptuous. Le Table for dinner had amazing French food. Le Jardin for lunch had fresh terrific sushi and dim sum. Le Grand Marocaine had wonderful Moroccan fare. We honestly preferred not to leave the hotel as we enjoyed the food so much.    The hotel arranged exciting excursions for us - to the Atlas Mountains Yves Saint Laurent's house Serge Lutens' lair by side car. They have special access to many places other hotels don't have but be forewarned - with access comes mandatory charitable donations that get into the thousands of dollars. The hotel tells you this in advance but quite casually so watch the fine print. They definitely assume their guest are not financially constrained in any way.    We only had a few niggles the biggest of which is that the spa is a big let-down. At first it's strikingly beautiful in a stark white way. But you quickly realize it's designed quite poorly and confusingly. It's huge but the employees are tucked in the back and they aren't helpful at explaining how the spa is designed or where to go. There are random small changing areas throughout but where was the sauna? At least one employee was rude and asked why we where there 30 minutes early - why your supervisor emailed us to come early to enjoy the amenities.... ""Oh OK"" to which she vomited out a bunch of words about what the spa has that was incomprensible and ran away. She was the kind of person who was rude when she was alone with us and smiled when her colleagues were around. The massage itself was fine nothing special but not worth the 20% mark-up vs. comparable 5 star properties. We cancelled our other services after our first visit.    The only other issue was another woman hostess in the restaurant who at first was cold perhaps because she thought we were tourists not guests and was kind of intimidating following us around the hotel with her hands behind her back. But after a day of my staring back at her she got the hint and made a course correction. I will say the hotel clearly favors guests over visitors who they often turn away.    All in all for food décor and service one of the best hotel experiences we have had in our lives.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,IVMorrison wrote a review Dec 2018,50,Best stay of my life,The staff at the Royal Mansour are the masters of detail. Yes it's an astronomically expensive stay but worth every single dirham. The VIP airport service is well worth splurging on as well. The car was luxurious the staff filled out our customs paperwork they even brought us straight to the front of every airport queue much to the chagrin of the many people in line (felt a little bad about that).    The property itself is breathtaking. Spotless and beautiful at every turn. It felt like Shangri la. Our riad was customized specifically to us and no detail was left unattended.    The butlers were discreet and efficient. Entering as we shut the door behind us and exiting before we re-entered.    My only disappointment was the excessive waste at the restaurant. The quantity of food served seemed wasteful and could've been better planned to avoid such waste. We let the chef feed us so we didn't make any menu choices.    The best part of the Royal Mansour was the feeling of having the entire property to yourself. We rarely saw another person or staff member while roaming the grounds or swimming.    And the spa. Good lord the spa will take your breath away. It's really one of the most opulent beautiful man-made structures I've ever seen.

It is well located near the Médina great pool amazing spa high quality pool welcoming staff. However it misses on some levels of service. I give housekeeping two stars. The first night we came back to find our room not made up and had to wait 45 minutes to have it done. The hotels response was you left the “do not enter”red light on. Two days later it happened to the couple we were traveling with and they received the same hotel response. A few days later we were invited to a group dinner at the Kasbah Tamadot and the group had also just been at the Royal Mansour. A number of them said their rooms had also not been made up at various times. One traveler also mentioned that the RM had not called at their specified wake up time and they almost missed their appointment. According to the hotels segment on Amazing Hotels the housekeeping staff is always in contact with the hotels reception desk thereby knowing when you leave your movement to and from the Riad. In reality that is not even close. We were in the entry level Superior Riad ($1000+ per night) which was small (especially the bedroom) and dark. HOWEVER we did enjoy our stay at the property.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,Jonathan F wrote a review Nov 2018,50,Drinks & Dinner,Staying at La Mamounia for five nights we strolled around the corner for drinks and dinner at the Royal Mansour. It is difficult to find the superlatives to do justice to the experience. The scale of the public rooms is palatial the qualilty of the Islamic decor is genuinely breath taking. The building is a tribute to the skill of Moraccan craftsmanship in creating a stunning interior. It is not simply a hotel it is a powerful statement of the beauty and sophistication of Islamic architecture and design on an awe inspiring scale.    Beyond the setting the meal was beyond words and every impecabbly trained member of staff was faultless in both their attitude and ability to deliver a very high service.    On reflection I came away from it all wondering if I felt totally comfortable being treated in such a reverential way. If you are an oligarch the sort of person who likes to waited on hand and foot you will love it!    For mere mortals like us it was surreal a regal experience!,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonathanfI701LG
Royal Mansour Marrakech,Bob N wrote a review Nov 2018,10,Horrible treatment,Worst experience ever I called their restaurant for lunch and they said they were open and it was about 2.30 pm and said they had plenty of room. I showed up with a group of 6 and the doorman to the hotel said that all restaurants were closed and I told him it’s impossible as I spoke to them 15 minutes earlier and then he specifically told me that we are not welcomed in the hotel pretty much unheard of.  Long story short he was simply the rudest man I have ever spoken to in my life and me and my guests were turned away over a lie.  So I went back to my hotel at La Mamounia and inquirered to speak to their general manager and I had him call the Royal Mansour hotel and they told him restaurants were open and just very frustrated with their lies and bad treatment.  I have no doubt that this is a fine hotel but no excuse for what they did.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/178bobn

Morrocan tea was a variety of local pastries with Moroccan mint tea and the French tea had a great selection of French patisserie- eclairs opéras etc as well as savouries and a choice of coffee or tea (Earl Grey in my case).All beautifully presented  Hotel is stunning and the staff courteous and attentive.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,billyoats1110 wrote a review Oct 2018,30,Don’t waste your money on the high tea,Went with a friend for high tea. We were curious as reviews of this hotel are epic and reviews were mixed on the high tea    We thought ok let’s go find out for our selves. It’s not the cheapest so we were expecting Titz style  Having done over 30 high teas I can say it’s not even close to the Ritz    We booked online. Put in our dietary request of no seafood. Allergies.  Every high tea we put in dietary requests and the high tea is catered to this and ready upon arrival.    We arrived. Found reception and they seated us in the court yard.  Then asked us what high tea we wanted. French. Moto con or English  We said we had put this in our booking. English high tea.    Then when it came out. Sandwiches had seafood. We said we had read menu online and as such made request in our booking.    So away goes the high tea and cows back out. Much to our disappointment it’s just replaced eith more cucumber sandwiches    Where normally they make up something different to what’s on the menu    The bread was a bit dry    Blueberry muffin a scone and cakes  The top was of the three tier platter was pink and white marshmallows.    This is disappointing when you pay a decent price to be served up marshmallows?????    The teas were ordinary. Darjling . Earl grey. Celylon etc. No special blended teas that you would normally find    Service was average    Came out to take order serve food and never to be seen again    Wanted to pay and no one came. After waiting half an hour I finally went to reception who said someone will come    Monk e came so I went up to the bar to pay.    For a hotel of this stature the staff are very unfriendly or attentive as you would expect    The court yard itself was pleasant. Very quiet. However annoying that there are smokers allowed while your trying to enjoy the high tea    I love high tea experiences. But this one is not do again. It wasn’t worth it to pay $65 and get served marshmallows is a joke You’d never get that at the Shard. The ritz or even simple high teas in a Sofitel around the world .    My strong recommendation. Save your money and go enjoy something somewhere else.    Very average.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,Basil A wrote a review Oct 2018,50,Dream land,Although the hotel room was a little expensive it was worth every penny.    Very fancy Moroccan style Riad. Nice staff (except for the receptionists 😄). The one thing that made me very mad is that they preauthorized an extremely high amount on my credit card at check-in for extra services (MAD 10k) which will take around 2 weeks to be refunded to my credit card after checkout.    We had dinner at The La Grande Table Marocaine. The food was unbelievably delicious 😋 and the atmosphere of the restaurant is wonderful and romantic. We ordered Lamb Tangia which was sooooo tasty but it does take very long time to be cooked and served (it took over an hour of wait).  Would highly recommend the hotel and its restaurants.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,LP21129 wrote a review Oct 2018,50,"Exceptional, Luxurious Resort with Your Own Private Riad","A group of six family members stayed at Royal Mansour in September. Upon arrival at the airport we were greeted by a representative who fast tracked us through customs and waited with us while we retrieved our luggage. Then we were led outside to Royal Mansour’s Mercedes SUV that took us the short ride to the resort. Upon arrival at the resort we were greeted by the general manager and staff and then introduced to our butler who took us to our riad.  The resort consists of 53 riads (traditional Moroccan house with a courtyard in the middle). It has a few indoor restaurants a pool and poolside restaurant a spa with its own large pool a piano bar and a beautiful courtyard lobby area. The grounds are beautiful and immaculate with gardens palm trees and decorative water fountains.  We stayed in a 3-bedroom riad and it was luxurious. The first level consisted of a bright and airy center courtyard that was open to the retractable ceiling and around it was a living room dining room kitchen study and a sitting area. It also had a patio with seating off the living room. The second level had three bedrooms each with a private bathroom and another sitting area in the hallway. The sitting areas on the first and second floors were built in banquette seating with beautiful pillows. The third floor consisted of a beautiful spacious tri-level rooftop terrace with a small plunge pool patio table and chairs a cabana with seating and additional lounges located on different levels of the terrace. On the terrace there was also an indoor space that had a bathroom shower and a ""hammam"" - a traditional Moroccan steam room. A butler is assigned to each riad. The butlers and other staff use private elevators that go from your riad to their underground city where all of the behind the scenes preparations take place. Because of the extensive underground network of elevators kitchens wine cellar laundry etc. you don’t see the staff going to and fro.  Our butler Mohammed made our stay extra special. He was friendly polite easy to talk to and accommodated our every request. At certain times during the day there were figs and pastries in our living room. We never saw them being placed there but we happily indulged. A couple of days we had breakfast in our riad and Mohammed saw to it that our orders were placed and delivered. When we hung out on the rooftop terrace one day Mohammed brought cold drinks. When we decided we wanted to dress up and have dinner at the resort’s traditional Moroccan restaurant he made reservations and led us there.  We could have stayed at the resort and in our riad with its rooftop terrace the entire time enjoying being pampered and the luxury of our riad and the entire resort. However we did want to see more of Marrakech and the Medina so the concierge arranged a tour guide for us which was excellent. Overall we enjoyed the resort and all it had to offer and enjoyed seeing the sights in Marrakech.",Date of stay: September 2018,,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LP21129

Royal Mansour Marrakech,Ruizhi L wrote a review Sep 2018,40,"Great, but not perfect.","Stayed here for 3 nights. Overall we were very pleased with Royal Mansour. The hotel is architecturally stunning and amenities plentiful. With all the information on social media and television we certainly came with high expectations. I have to say Royal Mansour checked most of the boxes though fell short on a few. Is it perfect? No. How does it compare to some other leading hotels around the world? I won't say they're the best among the ones I've stayed at. I would have given a 5 star review but one incident prevents me from doing so which I will elaborate in the review.    Pros:  The airport fast track service and transport to/from hotel was a nice experience.    The concierge desk was very helpful and helped us planned our three day experiences very thoughtfully.    The riad and hotel ground is stunning. Royal Mansour is unbeatable in this regard.    I loved the Hammam bath at the spa such a great experience. You cannot get similar treatment in any other hotel spas.    The Moroccan restaurant at the hotel is another highlight with amazing food living music and super friendly and attentive staff.    The daily fresh fruits and treats were a nice gesture.    The gym is well equipped and there are two pools to choose from.    The staff here are very professional and attentive in general though (perhaps due to language barrier and culture differences) they sometimes can come off as a bit brusk and impatient.    I highly recommend the guided tour. Our guide asked for our preferences and spend a good chunk of the day showing us some authentic Moroccan experiences.    Cons:  We found a cigarette butt in the bath salt container the first night we checked in. I called the front desk and they sent house keeping to take the contaminated one away. The house keeping staff apologized profusely. It wasn't a huge deal and I wouldn't blame house keeping on this. It's more of a nasty previous guest situation. With three floors and more than 7 rooms to clean and turn down I would say the house keeping did fantastic jobs. It's unreasonable to expect them to inspect every container of the bath room amenities. However I did not hear any follow-up from the management which is very unprofessional and shows a lack of attention to details regarding guest relationship. I wasn't expecting any comps or free night a simple follow-up and ""we're sorry"" would suffice. Royal Mansour fell short in that regard.    It's nice of them to provide international adapter however the one placed in room was not functional and I had to call to have it replaced. The replacement didn't fully function either (the American outlet was broken).    I spent 30 min in the spa relaxation room prior to my treatment during my entire stay there was no cold water and no clean glasses to use for the juices.    Quite a few locks in the locker room were broken and there wasn't clear instruction on how to use the locks (nor were instruction given by staff).    This was a bit odd but there was only one of each type of coffee cups (one espresso one medium and one large cup). You would think they should all come in pairs given there are two guests in a riad.    This was for the Moroccan restaurant before offering drinks I would appreciated if price were informed. I guess most guests here don't care that much about the price but 40 euro for a glass of champaign (just for comparison the retail price at Binny's in the US is around $50 for the same bottle) is a bit a rip-off.    The guest relationship team gives out the vibe of ""we're the best and people will come to us no matter the reviews"" rather than some other places where the team is actively cultivation position guest experience.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,DFWTraveler78 wrote a review Sep 2018,50,Amazing Spa!,I've wanted to visit the Royal Mansour for years and thought a spa treatment and tea would be a nice way to experience it (without staying there!). When you enter the grounds are gorgeous and every detail of the inside of the main hotel are amazing - simply breathtaking. They spared no expense and didn't overlook anything - it is a beautiful space! I ordered Moroccan tea and didn't realize that came with some exquisite pastries and honey - which was quite a lot for one person but totally worth the splurge to just sit in the bar area and take in everything while sipping on hot tea. The spa area (I had a facial) was also gorgeous - the detail of the waiting room was so pretty - I could've just sat there taking it in for an hour. The service was impeccable there was always somewhere standing by ready to assist - whether it was showing me to the spa area (a short walk from the main hotel lobby) or walking me through my spa treatment. The facial itself was great - even for just a facial I got my own spa suite that was huge!

On entering agreed magical and beautiful .... Unfortunately having travelled around the world and stayed in some seriously luxurious properties this place was a huge let down! Who on earth has employed such a bunch of useless staff who quite frankly have no customer service etiquettewe wondered around for half an hour wondering where everyone was then finally came across a restaurant with a waitress who is in desperate need of hospitality training or maybe just get herself some plain manners!  On explaining to her why we there we were literally shooed away !!!?? because we were too early for out high tea and apparently she was busy with one client whom needed some kind of privacy. Helllooo young lady wake up to yourself if your ONE customer needs that much privacy?? and they are the only person in the restaurant .??... room service is surly the answerwho behaves like this in a so called 5 star hotel? A huge tip for you silly girl tell your customers where they can wait a bar reception look around .. a gift shop etc etc etc  Out of the blue three other staff members all turned up didn't even looked in our direction and huddled in a corner for a chat and also ignored us..this is to say we didn't bother staying for tea and went back the MO where their staff know how to behave. I would of stayed at this hotel next time i was in Mksh however have come to the conclusion with such badly behaved obnoxious staff even if YOU paid me stay there I'm afraid i would have to decline...poorly done Royal Mansour.,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anaher5

I booked a reservation for their High Tea in the late afternoon after a full day of sightseeing. What a gorgeous hotel! I chose to sit in the stunning courtyard/lobby despite the warm temperature because it was so beautiful! You have the option of sitting in the bar piano area or the lobby/courtyard. They offer multiple tea services so I selected the Moroccan High Tea. Everything was so beautifully presented and tasted amazing. The selections were highly almond-based so if you have a nut sensitivity you need to reconsider or communicate to the staff. The service was top-notch and although I wasn’t staying at the hotel they treated me as if I was a guest. The courtyard is so serene. The hotel feels very private and the food service is definitely 5-star.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,Melody5 wrote a review Aug 2018,50,Supremely Opulent and a Worthwhile Extravagance!,I have been fortunate to travel very well in my lifetime. I have stayed at numerous luxury properties (many of which I haven't yet posted on TripAdvisor) but nothing compares to the Royal Mansour. It is by far the most opulent and luxurious place I have ever stayed in. Where do I begin?    For starters the place itself is unbelievably beautiful. I mean flawless. Though it is extremely expensive you get an entire 3 story riad of your own to stay in complete with butler rooftop plunge pool and so many extras it makes all other luxury properties pale in comparison! Everything is so sumptuous and they do not skimp at all on the amenities.    For instance each night we came back to the riad to a stunningly presented cake or pastry or treat that was set out on china etc. Not just the lovely chocolates on your pillow or bedside that some luxury hotel provide. And the bathroom products were incredible! Full sizes of luxury shampoo and conditioner and fragrant rose hand creams all of the highest quality and packaging. They even included a wooden hair brush and comb also of the highest quality. And everything was wrapped up like a gift. Just incredible. Not only that after I used them the first night they provided new ones the next day!    Each riad is like a palace unto itself! Every door hinge door handle shade pull and light switch is flawless and a work of art. Even the shower drain was unbelievably beautiful!! It is like a precious jewel everywhere you look just a feast for the eyes. The king of Morocco designed the place and so it is no exaggeration to say the place is fit for a king. It truly is! The mosaics the carvings the fabrics everything was supremely luxurious and comfortable.    The food was out of this world from the lovely cakes and pastries they left in our room to the amazing brunch and fantastic dinners. Everything was perfect. Even at brunch the waiters wore white gloves. The service was flawless and warm so attentive in fact that I even had one of the restaurant hostesses escort me all the way to the restroom! No tacky pointing me in the right direction as you so often encounter at other places. She treated me like royalty walking me all the way to the door and then politely bowing off to her post.    The spa/hammam is every bit as beautiful as you see in the pictures. You must have a spa treatment. I thoroughly loved it and completely delighted in the relaxation time afterwards... my own private curtained canopy bed with fine linens and pillows. The curtains were closed all around me as I peacefully napped for about 30 minutes only to be politely awoken by a staff person bringing me hot tea served on the most beautiful little Arabic tea set.    This is a very expensive hotel but well worth a visit if you can afford it. If not save up your pennies and plan to stay at least once in your lifetime.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,JimMacNaughton wrote a review Aug 2018,30,Slightly disappointed.,The building is incredible the architecture is phenomenal and the attention to the construction detail is superb. Apparently it took 3 and a half years to build and I can see why truly amazing hotel. My disappointment is with the staff who seem to have only just met each other message were not passed on service we asked for were not done. We were supposed to be going on an evening camel ride that was cancelled due to a sandstorm absolutely no fault of the hotel at all so to surprise my wife I went to the hotel gift shop where she had seen a stunning blue dress. I had spoken to Samantha in the shop the day prior she wasn't on duty that night another dark haired lady was. She was not in the shop when I arrived but came a few minutes later as I was wearing my beach shorts (as I was going on the evening camel ride) she tutted at me walked to the rear of the shop under the stairs and talked on her mobile. Needless to say the dress is still in the shop. Upon leaving the hotel on the final day we were told our bags would be collected from our room. Just about to leave checked and no bags they were then hurriedly collected placed in the boot of the car we drove off before the boot was shut cases fell out damaging 2. The spa is a massive disappointment too any other 5 star hotel in the world allows hotel guests to use the spa facilities steam room etc not this one you have to book a minimum of an hours treatment first.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,zebracat wrote a review Jun 2018,50,I still daydream about Royal Mansour...,In terms of architecture beauty and luxury this hotel is a perfect 10. From your own riad to the grounds spa lobby area and restaurants the overall design is truly outstanding and you could easily spend your days here just marvelling at the attention to detail. It is certainly the most beautiful property I’ve ever stayed at and although very expensive a once-in-a-lifetime experience that every traveller who appreciates the finer things in life should save up for. After our 3-night stay we definitely felt like we spent our money well. It’s a magical place and you’ll truly feel like royalty for the entire duration of your stay – but be prepared for the reality outside the walls of Royal Mansour. I must admit that it made me feel a bit uncomfortable at times. Such as being picked up in a Bentley at the airport; don’t get me wrong fast-tracking immigration and bypassing long queues is amazing. So is having somebody pick you up and driving you to your hotel. The type of car was perhaps unnecessary in my own humble opinion. But I suppose this is a very subjective matter and it makes sense since you are after all paying a somewhat ridiculous amount of money per night.    The highlights:    - A spacious riad on 3 floors with an amazing downstairs patio area heavenly bed plenty of high-quality bathroom amenities and a plunge pool at the top floor (with partial views of the Atlas Mountains).    - Dinner at La Grande Table Marrocaine : Fabulous food excellent service and very romantic decor. The pigeon pastilla was outstanding. And Chef Yannick Alleno himself was even there on our first night!    - The spa experience was much better than expected and the private Hamman session was fantastic. Very professional and qualified staff really good massage as well. (We were a bit sceptical since this was our first ever Hamman and some of the spa reviews we read prior to our stay were a bit mixed.)    - The grounds are wonderful. We spent a couple of hours just walking around and exploring taking pictures and being amazed by the picture-perfect scenery.  Bottom line: we were happy to just relax on one of the floors of our own riad most of the time and it was very difficult to leave the premises. Royal Mansour is definitely a place for those not needing or seeking plenty of activities and constant action.    Room for improvement - considering the price you pay I have to express some criticisms:    - Service overall could still be improved. Upon check-in we weren’t really given much information about the hotel and the services they offer nor of the inclusions of our Romance Package. We basically had to find out everything ourselves. Check-out was very slow and it took them 30 minutes to finalise. Service at the spa was equally slow and somewhat inefficient.    - Breakfast which we ordered to our riad each morning was not up to standard. The ingredients in themselves were ok but the menu and the dishes lacked inspiration creativity and finesse. Eggs benedict which I ordered soft were overcooked the pancakes were bland... Unfortunately very far from the quality of the dishes at La Grande Table Marrocaine.    - I’m not too keen on the day visitors they allow in. We stayed at Royal Mansour slightly off season but saw a fair few of them wandering around the grounds by the pool the spa and the restaurant areas. I hope they limited the number of guests they let in (especially during peak season) or else it will get too busy and no longer feel like a magical private and tranquil place. It was already borderline ‘too busy’ for our liking.    Luckily these things can easily be improved and the overall experience was still so fantastic that I would not hesitate to return.,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Luxembourg City, Luxembourg",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zebracat
Royal Mansour Marrakech,Francescag5 wrote a review May 2018,50,4 days of complete decadence,Oh. My.  This hotel (series of Riads) is the most beautiful place I have ever stayed. I booked the superior Riad and was upgraded as it was my sisters 40th birthday. Breakfast on the roof terrace of the Riad is a must and then a Dip in the private (small) pool to cool off. Only a 5-10 min walk to the souks. The Ftour meal was outstanding. The staff were so helpful but incredibly discreet. Nothing was too much trouble. Nearly forgot to mention that we were whisked through security and cleared the airport in minutes. Private transfer (included in the price) in a luxury vehicle. Happy days.

The individual riads are just so lovely and cosy- and the labyrinth underneath the ground ensures that it’s totally tranquil as the service element is just not seen - from housekeeping to room service - everything is moved under the ground and you see nothing they just pop up into the riad and the grounds remain serene and private.

The property is absolutely beautiful and right near main attractions of Marrakech (if you can drag yourself away from the property). There are gardens and a labyrinth of pathways that wind around to different areas. The spa itself is stunning with sky high ceilings. I received a Hammam treatment a facial and a foot refoundation. The facial and the foot massage were excellent if typical of other luxury spas. The Hammam was nothing close to typical. It was different and interesting and relaxing and good and my skin was baby soft afterwards.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,Demaluxury wrote a review Apr 2018,50,Like staying at the king’s palace.,I rate it ten stars ⭐️  I think staying in this property is the closest thing to the king’s palace.👑    The hotel architecture:    Breathtaking the craftsmanship is at its best in this property. I haven’t seen anything like it in the whole of Marrakech.    From the walls to the doors i cant have enough of its charm.  When im in the bedroom every corner u see beauty... its not a hotel villa its a true palace.  We had the second category of the riyadh  Which is larger and prettier than the basic one if luxury and interior is important to u..    I did a shooting at this hotel bought two kaftans. The photos were amazing the photographer was recommended by the concierge team.👌🏼 the concierge team were amazing. Specially the head concierge . He truly gave us prices suggestions..    Service  Was impeccable.. from the concierge to the staff in the breakfast area.. to the housekeeping manager who made sure we were happy.  The products in the villa was of an amazing quality  They even provide milk makeup remover.. bath oil hair mask instead of normal conditioner.. hair comb and hair brush.. all in different colors of silk bags..  Products are another level of luxury.    Spa  is breath taking...    Even the cars used when we request private transportation are again another level of luxury  Not standard s class Mercedes or range rover or bently. No..  the most special edition special order ones. The kind that u order for ur self..    I used to laugh because before i came to marrakech i was compairing and thinking which hotel should i stay in . Mainly between royal mansour and la mamounia.  There is nooooooo comparison what so ever!!!  Went to la mamounia its really hard to compare any thing with royal mansour to be honest.    Breakfast  Was a very royal breakfast. Special rich morrocan cuisine is displayed wonderfully.    They had amlu 🌰which is amazing nut butter with toasted argan oil i ordered 20 pieces to take home.    If i would suggest a place to go to dinner in marrakech:  dar yaqout . Has an amazing ambiance set menue.  And maison arab the food was good and charming hotel.

The level of service how well trained staff are how helpful they are and how polite everyone is makes the experience a relaxing and exceptional one. This truly is one of the leading hotels of the world no doubt about it.    The property itself is beautiful and artistic perspective. Its a very heavy Moroccan style - so if you're looking for a Four Seasons type decor or a modern hotel this is not the place to stay. If you're looking for a unique experience where you truly feel like you're in a Moroccan palace - this is the place to stay. Its one of these hotels that must be experienced to be appreciated. The taste isn't for everyone and its not necessarily somewhere you go to multiple times but definitely worth experiencing at least once.    I stayed in a 2 bedroom riad and its huge with multiple seating areas lounges private dining area private kitchen rooftop plunge pool rooftop lounge multiple fire places and more! Expect a private butler there the whole time helping with pretty much anything you need.    Food at the poolside restaurant is really special creative & perfectly executed with refinement.

The reception when you arrive is amazing people are friendly and speak many languages. The rooms are huge they are more like 3 floor apartments where you have a living room in the Lower level then the room and then a small private pool. The breakfast and the service at the breakfast is amazing. Now the spa service is terrible staff are not friendly at all tried to book a massage two days in advance and not only they didn’t book it but were rude about it. Then I went to have dinner at La Grande table marocaine and the food was so so the service was friendly but they took like an hour and a half between courses and the food was nothing spectacular expected much more. The staff overall is good but when you pay what you pay for it you expect absolute perfection. I sincerely think that the service at the aman resorts is better for example. Overall I liked it a lot.

The only problem:  We got hungry so went to the spa restaurant (which was a private room for just us which we absolutely loved) but the food is just bad... It is very pretentious Los Angeles ""detox"" stuff. I understand they wanted to have a very light menu for the spa but it was just inedible.  It was a lot of cucumber a lot of quinoa steamed bad fish with more cucumber...  We are in Morocco give us some nice food not cucumbers and kales...

The hotel is gorgeous so it's worth a visit even if you're not staying there. We had lunch outside in the garden which was lovely and delicious (and they serve wine! which is hard to come by in Morocco). Then we went to our spa appointments. The spa is stunning! You feel like you're in a palace. We got there early and relaxed by the pool and the garden. We all did the basic Hammam service and I was skeptical at first because I've never done a hammam before. But it was really great! I booked a private room and you really do feel like a queen in there. It's a big beautiful marble room all to yourself and then you get this amazing relaxing spa service. My only complaint is my lower back & tailbone started to hurt from lying on the marble for an hour so at one point I just grabbed one of the towels in a nearby cart and laid it under my lower back which solved it.

All you need to know is in the middle of Morocco this place has electric candles and a gas fire in the bar. Just hideous.  In the evening a tuneless songstress does dark things to a Marvin Gaye classic soullessly piped around the ground floor on a cheap sound system.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,dtdunk wrote a review Feb 2018,20,For those with more money than sense,Care to guess how much a small can of Pringles cost in the minibar? $16 USD.    In a way that explains everything you need to know about the Royal Mansour. This hotel seems to be a competition to see who can spend the most money while caring the least. For the rest of us the exorbitant prices might be justified if there was exceptional service or design. Sadly the Royal Mansour falls short on both.    Service was a disaster for a hotel aspiring to be five stars. Across our 12-day trip in Morocco we had the least most disinterested service here despite this hotel being by far the most expensive. I attempted to bring up some of these issues with a manager and was directed to send an email to the generic info address. Upon checkout (with an incorrect bill nonetheless) and still no response from management I mentioned some of the issues with our stay and again was offered nothing expect a half-hearted apology they couldn't even find the email. The fact we were unable to speak with management after several attempts should explain everything about how this hotel is run.    The design might appeal to some guests but for my taste it screamed gaudy and pretentious. The common areas were better than the rooms which feature a tiny bathroom despite the significant space throughout the riad. Competing materials textures colors and patterns are a theme throughout your personal riad where some editing would have gone a long long way. Also be well aware the common areas of the hotel will CONSTANTLY be filled with visitors posing and taking photos throughout the day.    The famous spa was equally underwhelming. Once again the common area is filled with people posing and taking photos which is not too relaxing before your treatment. Much like the rest of the hotel the spa is also outrageously expensive but does not live up to the price charged. My massage begin 15 minutes late and finished 5 minutes early and I was offered no apology or explanation. You very much feel like a cog in a machine with no personal touch care or attention to detail.    Save your money and stay elsewhere unless you have so much of it that the thought of a $45 USD cesear salad or $70 USD tagine on the room service menu seems entirely reasonable.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"San Francisco, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dtdunk

The bling is appropriately matched by its traditional grandeur.    We had the Moroccan and the English afternoon tea between us and we were accompanied by our 5 year old child. The english tea is as is usual from a posh tea bag so nothing spectacular and the sandwiches / cakes looked exact as you would expect. The moroccan tea was very nice and the cakes etc were very sweet / detailed / beautiful. No complaints there.    All that said we did not feel the service levels matched up to expectations or the amazing standard of the venue e.g. compared to afternoon tea at the Shard in London. They made no accommodation for our 5 year old which is surprising giving the high service levels in Marrakech generally. The staff were entirely inattentive they served us the tea etc. and the next contact was us asking for the bill. In between we had to ask for a moroccan tea top up because the table was a little tight and it was left at the bar so out of reach.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,John I wrote a review Dec 2017,50,Once In a Lifetime Experience,The Royal Mansour Marrakech is an absolutely dazzling hotel. The location of the hotel is great. It is only a 5 minute walk to Koutoubia Mosque and Jemaa el-Fnaa square which are both can't miss attractions. Everything about the hotel and each Riad is amazing. We moved from #3 to #21 because some pigeons were roosting in the #3 entry area. For both Riads #3 and #21 the entry area living room bedroom bathroom and rooftop deck including plunge pool are all spectacular. We spent lots of time in our Riad to enjoy it's beauty. The staff is absolutely phenomenal. Particularly the guest service staff and notably Ikram Bouabid who is charming responsive and very professional. We celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary at the hotel and Ikram had our Riad strewn with beautiful rose petals accompanied by small romantic candles. Also we ate at the hotel's wonderful French restaurant and Ikram had the staff make us a wonderful dessert with happy anniversary writing and candles. Also the concierge staff were all great including Touria and Abdellah (sp) and their restaurant recommendations were spot on. Additionally the doormen were wonderful including David. The breakfasts were amazingly good and the service was over the top. The grounds and pool area are all drop dead gorgeous. All the furnishings and common areas of the hotel are beautiful and very tasteful and no detail is overlooked. The only small caveat is if you are offered the use of the hotel car be aware there is a significant charge for its use. We were not aware of these charges for twice using the hotel car and when I asked them about these charges the hotel graciously removed them from our bill. The hotel is expensive but worth every penny or dirham as the case may be. I am generally not one for hyperbole but our 4 nights stay there was truly a once in a lifetime experience and I would urge everyone to stay there if it fits within your budget.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,EightRoadsTravelCo wrote a review Nov 2017,50,As incredible as you think it’ll be and more!,My boyfriend and I stayed with Royal Mansour in November for a few nights. We absolutely LOVED our time here which was without fault and totally relaxing.  We were picked up in the resort’s gorgeous grey Range Rover complete with ochre leather seats and whisked into heaven! The property is as you’d expect totally immaculate tended beautifully.  We were walked immediately to our Superior Riad which took both of our breath away. This is traditional Moroccan design at its pinnacle. Spotless beautifully designed individual little palaces.  You’ll want for nothing. We loved the daily cakes and extras and dining in the Riad was fantastic. The club sandwich here is amazing!!  We also loved our Butler who when he heard me say I loved the financiers he left popped back with 2 more without me even knowing - it’s touches like this that make this hotel stand head and shoulders above others.  The thing I loved most about Royal Mansour? This is possibly the best hotel in the whole of Africa and one of the best and most exclusive in the world but it is completely unpretentious. It’s wonderful. Staff are so friendly and sincere and kind. We wandered around in shorts and trainers and nobody cares. Even for drinks. If you’re staying here you’re staying here and I loved that. It felt like home albeit home in a huge vast palace. Credit to the GM here and senior team for creating such a lovely atmosphere.  Breakfast is divine. Don’t miss the mint tea or the orange jam. Incredible.  The spa is out of this world and you’ll soon see why it’s award winning. The hammam is superb definitely book in for the 1 hour treatment even if you do nothing else.  Location is PERFECT. A 10 minute walk to the souks and old town and a 10 minute cab to Gueliz.  If you’re coming to Marrakech and want something traditional but the absolute ultimate in luxury the world over then there’s no question you MUST stay here!,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EightRoads

It was probably no definitely the BEST HOTEL I'VE STAYED IN BAR NONE. Everything from the service accommodations amenities gym/spa restaurant/food were impeccable. Upon arrival (after being dropped off in a gold S-Class) I was immediately greeted by Marie my hostess and was checked in inside my Riad all while being offered mint tea and an assortment of desserts and fruits. All of the ""rooms"" here are Riads basically stand-alone houses with your own personal roof deck and pool. Through Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts I was IMMEDIATELY UPGRADED to the Prestige Riad a three-story house with my own roof deck and soaking pool. The entire property is set-up as a mini medina and is a mirror of Marrakech in which it's located. The complex is pin-drop quiet and feels supremely exclusive while being steps away from the central market Jemaa-El-Fnaa. This really felt like a real 5-star experience no expense was spared whatsoever. Through Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts I was given a complimentary bottle of wine a $100 spa credit and complimentary breakfast in my Riad every day. I was even given my own stationary embossed with my name (talk about being spoiled rotten). Everything about it was pure opulence and luxury.

You would not be disappointed. But I must say it is starting to look a little tired. Will need big renovation by 2020. The staff are extremely polite and helpful. The lady manager for concierge there Touran is very good. She is an excellent business woman who will go far. She was highly professional. Her English was very good. She knew how to manage in a five star top rated hotel. I would not be surprised if one of the top Dubai hotels snatch her.  Other staff were also very helpful and accommodating.  The food and snacks are extortionate and shamefully expensive. A small bottle of coke £12. A soup £50 etc...  On the whole I would recommend this hotel if you don't want to get upset on your visit to Marrakesh because the other places and Riads are inside the actual old city and that is not a place you should stay. The smell of sewage will knock you out...it's very bad. You should visit the Suka and bazaar. Within walking distance of the hotel.  The wash basin in our bedroom bathroom was blocked and took for ever to drain. Otherwise very good. Be warned the Riads of this hotel have hundreds of stairs. You have to be fit.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,sambfh wrote a review Aug 2017,50,Palatial but not quite perfect.,Like a previous poster we had a two stop visit to Marrakech spending two nights at the RM and eight at the Mandarin. The RM is a very beautiful sublimely furnished and elegant option and I can fulsomely commend it - but for us the MO was the better hotel.    We booked a two nights package through LHW that included a dinner at the Table Marocaine an upgrade to a Prestige Riad and a couple of hammam treatments (which we did not take up). We were not offered an upgrade which was disappointing (both because of the package and because one is normally offered to LHW members in any event).Moreover we were told that the hotel was not busy ( we saw very few other guests) so there was really no excuse for not offering an upgrade IMHO.    The corollary of the lack of upgrade had only one significant repercussion for this fair skinned Brit - the outdoor space in the Superior Riad (unlike the Prestige Riad) had no shaded space which made relaxing on the sun terrace an uncomfortable experience. There were of course umbrellas by the pool but both of these hotels were chosen by us for privacy and peace. I should also mention that the bathroom was in my experience of very high end hotels somewhat poky.    Another slight irritation was the wait for the car at the airport on arrival; fellow passengers from our flight were whisked off to the hotel. We waited around for some 20 minutes for a car. At these rates there are many chances for hotel service to not quite reach the zenith of a perfect stay.    That said the food at the hotel is very good. There service is also very good but as a previous contemporaneous guest pointed out not without its glitches. We had to call for our Riad to be serviced on day 1 (well after midday)    The hotel is a short walk from the souks (a walk not without its impediments and irritations but this is Marrakech) and it is a blissful experience to return to the cool welcome of the RM.    I am separately reviewing the MO which in my view is the better hotel. No-one should be put staying at the RM it is quite beautiful and the service is good without being obsequious but when paying some £1000 per night one should be picky in order to give fellow travellers the full picture. The MO beats the RM for warmth of service size of accommodation tranquillity and sense of privacy. The RM just edges ahead on food but I must say that this advantage is outweighed by the frankly ridiculous uplift on prices; this is Marrakech and there is really no excuse for taking the proverbial in this regard.,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Jersey, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sambfh
Royal Mansour Marrakech,WandererFantacy wrote a review Aug 2017,40,Rare Luxury,Royal Mansour (RM) is without any question a very luxurious property with all the dazzling art works designs and hardware that it should be proud of. The soft services as some reviewers mentioned is a slightly different story and may seem inadequate depending on how you interpret it.    Unlike the modern and chic Mandarin Oriental (which I also stayed and reviewed) one may not feel the bubbly social interactions here at RM. Instead one feels a clear sense of pride that with possible language barrier could potentially lead to negative impression. You won't see a lot of big smiles and greetings as RM seems to be more about being distinctive and private. And indeed the setting of private multi-story riads and staff's generally mellow and uninvolved attitude set the tone for this property. I did not find this particularly problematic as I enjoyed the private and tranquil moment after some hustle and bustle in the city. With that said if you are looking for a more amicable and social atmosphere RM may not be the right choice.    I loved the short stay and truly appreciated the unbelievably detailed and beautiful architecture and design everywhere in this property and would definitely consider staying here again when I return. Honestly this type of luxury and the value is very rare anywhere in the world. However given a true luxury demands excellent quality in both hard and soft services in my opinion I suggest RM management pay a little more attention about its customer facing (e.g. proper communication with customers before during and after services; understanding and managing services to meet a variety of customers). This is not to say it should abandon the great pride and respect to its core customers' preference for privacy and comfort. But a little friendliness could go a long way (e.g. genuine smiles welcoming attitude for all customers).,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Chicago, Illinois",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WandererFantacy

Royal Mansour Marrakech,sx_sk wrote a review Aug 2017,10,"Nice hotel, poor staff attitude","I had afternoon tea at the Royal Mansour. While the food itself was fine and the staff members at the bar were lovely I'm afraid that the other services which I received at the Royal Mansour did not reach up to the appropriate standard.    When we reached the hotel lobby after we arrived there was no one to lead us to the bar. We had to walk around by ourselves to find the location of the bar. There was no sign or map to provide directions either.    After we finished our afternoon tea we stayed at the lobby for a few minutes to take some photos but a staff member at the lobby entrance kept staring at us suspiciously which made me feel uncomfortable.    Then we tried to find the spa to see if we could check it out because we were interested in booking a spa treatment for today or tomorrow. A lady then stopped us and asked if she could help us. I'm not sure if she assumed that we were tourists who did not spend any money at the hotel and would simply walk around. I explained to her politely that we just finished afternoon tea and would like to know if we could visit the spa. She said no firmly because we did not make a spa reservation. Since we are customers who are interested in making further bookings shouldn't the hotel staff be willing to show us around and explain to us the spa options?    Since she refused to show us the spa we did not argue with her and we decided to go back to our own riad. After asking her to get us a taxi to go to the medina she looked at us sceptically and asked if we were sure that we wanted a taxi and if we would want to take a ""short"" walk back to the medina by ourselves. Considering that the temperature was 44 degree celsius outside our riad in the medina is 2 km and more than 20 minutes away from the Royal Mansour and that we explicitly asked her for a taxi I don't think it was appropriate for her to tell us just to walk! We felt very unwelcome and belittled because of the way she spoke to us.    Before we visited the Royal Mansour we looked up online reviews and saw that many other customers were taken on tours around the hotel before their meal bookings with staff members telling them the hotel history and taking them to see various hotel facilities. Since the Royal Mansour is one of the most expensive hotels in Marrakech we expected the services to be top-notch. I'm afraid that our afternoon experience has been completely spoilt and let down by such services.    I sent a feedback/complaint email to the Royal Mansour to tell them about my experience. Management did not bother to reply to my email.",Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sx_sk

This hotel offers only Riad accommodation in various sizes meaning they don't have rooms but the traditional Moroccan houses with inner courtyards. As such you have perfect privacy and a level of service I haven't found anywhere else. You can literally call someone to unpack and repack your luggage when you arrive and then when you leave... There is a personalized notepad with each page engraved with your name on it as well as envelopes with the same. And every bill notification from the hotel to you is delivered on a silver tray in an envelope engraved with your name. All these little touches make you feel like royalty if only for a day.    The entire hotel is made up of Riads and small streets between them so its like a small village. There is a central building with the reception restaurant shops and a pool. We loved the incredibly detailed and luxurious Moroccan architecture and design witnessed everywhere from the buildings doors furniture lights floors fabrics...    We didn't dine outside our Riad no need to leave such a beautiful house but we ordered room service. It was delivered by our Buttler dressed in a Tux and wearing white gloves. And it was delicious and huge in portion also we had the moroccan tea and English tea menus in the afternoon which are whole meals by themselves. The breakfast was entirely a-la carte as you would expect in this hotel and made in the same moment you order it.

I was expecting good things partly because of the hotels reputation and partly because of the price we were paying but the hotel exceeded in so many areas. Firstly the property itself is truly stunning. The architecture the guest riads the interior the furniture the gardens every aspect is visually stunning and a destination in itself. Next the food everything was absolutely amazing from the breakfast to the bread and butter to the room service. Naturally this was to be expected given its overseen by the hotel's 3 Michelin starred chef but since leaving nothing tastes as good as the food there! Lastly the service right from the airport pickup with fast track immigration to the way the staff will adjust to your style the whole 'experience' from staying at the hotel was spectacular.  I would highly recommend a stay at the royal mansour and in hindsight I actually look at it as good value given there are more expensive properties in the world and that we have created some fantastic memories in a truly stunning property.

I feeling like a Guest of the Moroccon King exclusively with the highest standard of Hospitality. But this is the past unfortunately! After the opening of the new Garden with the large Pool it changed a lot included a lot of Kids. Some changes it's hard to understand far away from the point to accept them. For example around the Pool all day long noisy Party Music at the evening continues with a DJ who is playing Music. Some Riads are directly impacting by them.The open also the pool for outside guests can't understand or accept this at all. The Service getting worser and worser far away from that what the Royal Mansour standing for at the past. The Management don't really care about the Guest something arrogant! The GM never showed up to say Hello which is for me as a repeating guest something strange. Also the other Management members don't really care about the need of the guests looking like the care the money but not the Guests. Shameful when I'm thinking back what the Royal Mansour was standing for really for something special/uniqiue in the world.  We talk about a place with a average rate per night around USD 1'500.00 up! For this I expect much more like the currently offer. The Question is what they like to be? A normal Hotel or something unique as before?

Royal Mansour Marrakech,GingerPl wrote a review May 2017,30,"Beautiful space, very mediocre spa","We did not stay at the Royal Mansour but reserved treatments at the Royal Mansour Spa as we had heard so much about how wonderful it was. The hotel itself and the grounds are absolutely beautiful and the interior of the spa is certainly stunning - beautiful lace-like wrought iron and glass in the lobby and the treatment spaces full of lovely carved marble. The architecture was impressive but the spa treatments were NOT.    My friends and I had booked a hammam treatment and one friend also booked a massage. Upon arrival we were shown into a paneled locker room to change but the room had an overwhelming sewage odor. When asked if we could change elsewhere due to the terrible smell the staff said there had been a plumbing problem there and showed us to another changing area on the other side of the spa. If there was a known problem and another space available why bring us there in the first place??    After changing we were shown into the treatment room - a large space with ""stalls"" divided by carved marble screens. We were each given a stall to lie down in - on the marble floor which was wet and heated from underneath. The staff then exited the room and we were left to lie on the marble floor for so long we wondered if they had forgotten about us entirely. The wet floor also felt uncomfortably warm after a while and I began to feel as if I were being sauteed. When the staff finally returned we were each rubbed down with an exfoliating gel and given a full body scrub to remove dry skin. We were then taken to sit in a cool plunge pool for a few minutes before being given robes and shown to a lounge area to relax and have tea. That was it - no lotion or oil after exfoliating nothing else so while my skin did feel smooth afterwards it also felt very dry. Of the hour spent in the hammam 2/3 of the time was spent lying alone on a warm wet floor. Not the experience we had in mind. My friend who had the massage after the hammam said it was also mediocre. Certainly not what we expected given the price and the reputation of the Royal Mansour.    After finishing tea in the lounge we returned to the changing area to get dressed. There was a sign noting that complimentary products (deoderant hair brushes etc) were available but they were not to be found in the changing room - we had to return to the front desk in the spa lobby with wet uncombed hair to request them. Would have brought my own things with me had I known but again I expected better amenities from the Royal Mansour.    Overall a beautiful spa setting but poor service and very mediocre treatments.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,Albelia V wrote a review Apr 2017,50,An Oasis in the Medina,My husband and I have travelled the world and stayed in many excellent hotel properties. We would place the Royal Mansour's riad at the top of our list. The property is very tastefully designed. It started with a very delightful courtyard. Once we entered there were to sitting rooms one with a working fireplace. The bedroom and master bathroom were truly palatial. Even the cosmetics were of excellent quality. The riad had so much space for storage. On the third level we had a lovely terrace with two long chairs a sofa canapé a plunge pool and a fireplace.    The gardens around the property included orange and lemon groves along with jasmine plants. Each morning as we walked to the delicious breakfast we heard birds chirping and smelled the fragrances from the gardens. This was so refreshing and a great start to the day.    We enjoyed the food in all of the restaurants at the Royal Mansour. The breakfasts are amazing with so much choice. In contrast to many other five-star hotels breakfast was served at the table. It was not buffet style. We also dined at La Grande Table Francaise and La Grande Table Marocaine. While maybe a bit on the pricey side they were both enjoyable experiences with excellent food.    The service from the hotel was of excellent quality. Everyone was friendly and helpful. In the evenings prior to leaving for dinner we asked the concierge to light the fireplace at a certain time and when we returned to our riad we had a cozy fire.    The location of the Royal Mansour is perfect. It is just a few minutes walk away from Jemaa el-Fnaa.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/albeliav
Royal Mansour Marrakech,Samantha M wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Top 10 Best Hotels In the World,Wonderful location the spa was incredible the architecture is amazing service is fantastic food is extraordinary rooms are so beautiful. I can talk about all the wonderful parts of this stay but I would remind people that this is a very expensive place to stay. I really only found one flaw. When you stay at this hotel you will not want to leave the hotel and you will only want to stay at the hotel. I recommend that you stay at this hotel to recover from jet-lagged and just spend time at the hotel. Then when you wish to view the city stay at another cheaper hotel this way you will spend more time visiting the city and you won't feel bad about all the money you are spending on the hotel. Otherwise I highly recommend this hotel it was incredible and everything was perfectly planned out.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Denver, Colorado",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/223samantham
Royal Mansour Marrakech,T R wrote a review Apr 2017,10,Disgrace!,"Well first of all I give top marks to the architects designers craftsmen and financiers of this truly magical place! It is so classy beautiful elegant.. So from a place like this one would expect a little bit of a decorum... Instead our one day of much needed rest was completely and utterly ruined by a bunch of people who moved to the riad next door. I dont know for sure but it seems that the riad was used as an office for a sports team. All of last evening and all of today there has been someone or the other outside our door making telephone calls... I counted 23 times ( that was from 2 pm). I politely asked the people to take their calls inside--no success. Well clearly they are uncivilized ignorants so I dont expect any better. But the really disappointing thing is that I called and spoke to the reception desk and the concierge twice! They were ""sorry""... but nothing beyond that!  I am so so heartbroken and upset! It costs a lot of money to stay here and the place is magical.. Such astonishing ignorance on behalf of the management is just unacceptable.",Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,New York,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/997tr
Royal Mansour Marrakech,Nicholas B wrote a review Apr 2017,40,Pavillion experience - a warning!,We went to Royal Mansour for the pool pavillion experience. At 3500 Dirhams it includes pool access with your own pavillion lunch and a treatment in the spa for 2 people. We thought this was a bargain in such a luxury hotel. It was truly an amazing experience with great service and the pedicure was relaxing and extremely professional in a wonderful spa.    We left having had an amazing time and were even planning to to return in the future to stay at the hotel.    However back at our own hotel in the evening we were informed by our receptionist that Royal Mansour had rang to tell us that we had forgotten something and to give them a call. I thought this was odd as I am very OCD about checking a place before we leave. We called Royal Mansour and they said they had forgot to charge us 1000 Dirhams and wanted payment and they were sending a taxi so it could bring us back to the Royal Mansour to pay!!    We obviously felt very uncomfortable with this and refused the person on the phone then said they would send someone to our hotel to pick up the money! We could not believe such behaviour from such an upmarket hotel and were shocked. We ended the call and they called back a few minutes later (obviously having realised how awful what they were suggesting was) to say that it was a terrible mistake and not to worry about the money they forgot to charge us.    The whole situation really put a downer on things and left us feeling very uncomfortable on our last evening in Marrakech.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nickbrazel

The la table morroccan was a lovely experience Pastilla and tagine were great finishing with a refreshing mint tea. We also dined in our Riad and it was a nice change butler serving you in white gloves and having a complimentary bottle of wine was just perfect.    The Spa has the best massage and the decor was so special. Heavenly...    Its place that you can experience once in your life...I felt like a princess where all your wishes come true.    Of course it comes with a price but the experience is all worth it.    The pool was nice but the service was letdown compared to the rest of what we experienced.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,RovingMouth wrote a review Mar 2017,50,Beyond a Hotel: Redefines Luxury,"Yes the Royal Mansour is frightfully expensive yet it is an experience that so marks its guests that so transcends what are categorized as luxury hotels that it is well worth the price of admission. My stay in December was so replete with moments of amazement that I am returning this May.  A visit to the Royal Mansour begins with meeting a representative of the hotel before hitting customs and immigration at the airport. This gentleman took me and my friend to a VIP kiosk bypassing all lines and we were quickly ushered to baggage claim and outside where the hotel's driver installed us in a Bentley. Minutes later we were luxuriously driven to the hotel where handsomely uniformed men opened the drive's three-story doors revealing the palace's glorious entrance.  Hostesses took charge of us and gave us a tour of the facilities then on to our riads three story homes we were to call our ""rooms"" during our stay. On the ground floor my riad (the most basic they propose) had a living room with access to my private garden three story atrium restroom and kitchen area. Mary my hostess seeing my glee at having a Nespresso machine (I'm a serious espresso drinker) asked what my favorite coffee was. Sure enough multiple sleeves of Roma mysteriously appeared within minutes in the kitchen while we toured the other floors of my riad.  On each floor there are doors making the riad accessible to the Royal Mansour's staff so they can service the riads and deliver items where desired. The second story revealed my bedroom and bathroom the third a roof terrace with a working fire place lounge chairs and a dipping pool.  Words cannot describe the craftsmanship of the floors walls ceilings furniture and art in the riads. My friend a famous interior designer was incessantly wowed by what she saw describing for me the intricacy of the work in the carving leather work stitching etc. While I'm not into design I was constantly awed by my surroundings constantly seeing new things around me (the bed-board marble work inlaid ceilings sculpted plaster walls etc) that wowed me. She a well-known professional who designs homes for billionaires was equally awe-struck.  The level of service equaled the surroundings. Team members are neither seen nor heard traveling from the main building to the riads in underground tunnels and appearing only when wanted and then instantly. Truly amazing.  I wish I were able to describe to my fellow travelers just how luxurious the Royal Mansour is but I cannot find the words.

It is so beautiful from the moment you enter you almost forget about seeing your room because you're taking in the workmanship that has gone into making this hotel magnificent.  Then you get to your Riad...Words cannot describe (we were in the Superior Riad)! We don't want to give away too many spoilers as we liked seeing elements of the room we didn't know about from their website or TA but it's beautifully crafted with so much attention to detail.  One thing to mention is the staff - all very good but you hardly ever see them! You definitely get the feeling that this place is made for the Royal family and they extend (at least part of) that service to their normal guests as well.  We would definitely visit this place again so much beauty that you don't even feel like leaving your room! Breakfast is out of this world (they deliver to your Riad).

The food at the hotel is beyond excellent cooked with the healthiest ingredients the local food the international menu and the breakfast are all perfect.

The gym is one of the most comprehensive and the trainers are amazing and helpful where they offer stretching tips for you. The sauna room is large & private where you can enjoy a full session alone.    THE HOTEL IS ULTRA ULTRA LUXURY but not only with its expensive construction made to perfection to depict real palaces and riads of old Morocco but also the service which is European in its standards but warm and humble staff with Moroccan hospitality.

An ornate archway combining the elegance and grandeur of moorish and andalusian architecture welcomes you to the lobby.

The stunning beauty and tranquillity soothes your spirit and the haunting sound of the muezzin adds to the charm and grace of the experience.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,mustbefivestar wrote a review Feb 2017,40,La Grande Expensive Table Marocaine,This is a beautiful restaurant perhaps one of the most beautiful rooms we've ever eaten in. However whilst I don't mind expensive there is always a borderline when it moves from enjoying great food and great surroundings to feeling like you are being completely fleeced. The prices here are over that line in particular for the wine list where I have never seen such ridiculous mark-ups. It was a lovely experience and the food expertly prepared but a clam tagine starter was a small bowl with perhaps 12 of the most juicy clams at over £30. it was over £100 for a king prawn and white bean tagine dish. Delicious but difficult to see where the cost went. A gorgeous box of sweets to take away was a welcome treat. In short this is very high end and not a place to go if you're after a nice relaxing cultural experience in Marrakech. It's for dressing up and forgetting about the cost. Budget at least £250 a head if you don't want to have 3 courses and a half decent bottle with service.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,CedricDamourParis wrote a review Oct 2016,50,The best,« Words cannot do justice to Royal Mansour’s unique beauty. Royal Mansour is more than a palace; it is the embodiment of Moroccan living as an art form ». The first time I read those words on the Royal Mansour website I wondered how it would be to actually stay at « more than a palace »...    Derived from the arabic for garden a riad is a traditional Moroccan home where peace and privacy are paramount. The riads at the Royal Mansour are not any typical Moroccan house though. They are as every inch of the hotel (the restaurants libraries lounges bars pools and spa) a living testimony and a showcase of Moroccan’s elite artisans’ craftsmanship : every detail you see is handmade handcrafted handsclupted… A place to see without being seen – with the latest in-suite electronic systems.    As every riad at the Royal Mansour mine was spread over three floors and was built around a central atrium : a private open air garden with the relaxing sound of trickling water in the fountain.    No detail has gone overlooked in this incredible resort. And the quality of service is unmatched. If you order room service you can request your food be served on your rooftop terrace. The breakfast alone is worth seeing : a smorgasbord of viennoiseries eggs bacon and other local staples served on a white table cloth. The staff move about throughout the medina and riad using a « behind the scenes » network of tunnels and lifts to discreetly tend to every whim and need including retrieving your sun glasses a mere two floors below if you’re feeling lazy !,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Paris, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CedricDamourParis

A world of the most amazing and beautiful Moroccan architecture gardens waterways and fountains that you give you a sense of total peace and solitude service the likes of which I doubt you have ever experienced before and accommodation that will quite simply take your breath away! Your Riad will be over three floors with a top floor open space complete with sun beds a fire for the cooler evenings a moroccan tent (in the Premier Riads) a private plunge pool and views out across the rooftops of Marrakech!  We ate in all three of the restaurants all amazingly designed with such care and service in each of them that was faultless caring and friendly! The food in each was perfection and if you stay in this Hotel I urge you to try them all!  The attention to detail with everything at The Royal Mansour is pure perfection. Each and every member of staff could not do enough to help us and the levels of service are quite frankly off the scale!  Our thanks to everyone that looked after us oh so well especially Salah who welcomed us showed us around and kept an eye on things during our entire stay Amin in Le Table Restaurant the care and consideration he showed us was exemplary the three Concierges Touria the Head Concierge together with Adele and Abdullah the very best Concierge service we have ever had in any hotel throughout the world and Rachid the Sommelier in their Moroccan Restaurant.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,TJP-Scottsdale wrote a review Oct 2016,50,One of Best Hotels in the World,As mentioned in my other reviews we're highly seasoned 5-star+ travelers - we're casual but very critical of the luxury hotels where we stay. For 1st trip to Marrakesh we researched Marrakesh resorts significantly to ensure we landed on the best - and for sure we did. The Royal Mansour is (as mentioned in the title) one of THE best hotels in the world. In a world of 5-star hotels The Royal Mansour is nothing short of 7-stars. Until you visit and experience it's hard to explain the level of luxury and accommodation in this resort. The individual riads are simply spectacular - the finest luxury accommodation we've ever encountered. The construction & architectural detail in the riads is some of the best I've ever seen. As for service - no comparison anywhere - every request accommodated. We booked directly with the hotel and experienced unbelievable follow up from our reservation coordinator (Jaafar) - just a hint of the great service to come. From the moment you step off your plane Royal Mansour representatives escort you through baggage and customs. Upon arriving to the resort we were greeted by a large welcoming staff - from there all of the staff know you and address your family by name. Of special mention the morning breakfast is unbelievable - again every request accommodated. We were there for 4 nights - could have easily stayed much longer - my family was disappointed when we had to leave. Location is also perfect - directly across street from the Medina and main square - and short walk to some really cool restaurants (out the back gate of the resort). The resort is now also expanding for a broader pool & garden area which will make it even more spectacular - we highly recommend The Royal Mansour - and look forward to another future stay.,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Scottsdale, Arizona",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TJP-Scottsdale

Royal Mansour Marrakech,LaCarmina wrote a review Oct 2016,50,Royal Mansour is a travel blogger and photographer's dream come true,Royal Mansour is one of the world's most luxurious hotels and deserves the title. King Mohammed VI hired over a thousand craftsmen and spared no expense to make his artistic vision a reality.    Marrakech’s Royal Mansour is only minutes from the bustling Square of the Dead but the atmosphere couldn’t have been a bigger contrast. We drove through opulent gardens and arches to the grand entrance where a lobby girl greeted us in a military-style outfit and white gloves.    At Royal Mansour guests don’t stay in rooms. They get their very own three-storey riad or house with an open courtyard. I had my own kitchen rooftop terrace with a swimming pool elevator. Every detail from the antique star lamps to the cushions with glass beads was exquisite.    Outside the gardens were blooming with bougainvillea and pomegranate trees. The landscape artist – Spain’s Luis Vallejo – also designed the Alhambra palace gardens.    I had the dinner of dreams at one of Royal Mansour’s restaurants La Grande Table Marocaine. It’s overseen by Yannick Alléno a chef with three Michelin stars. Seamless service by servers in white gloves and Moroccan dishes executed with finesse. For a travel writer and photographer this stay was a fantasy come to life.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Tokyo, Japan",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaCarmina
Royal Mansour Marrakech,holiday73 wrote a review Oct 2016,50,Took my breath away ! The Spa is out of this world.,Went for spa day with my sister and it was the best facial we have ever had in our life and I have been to many Spas over the world.  We were shown around and even saw one of the riads which was stunning.  It did feel a little intimidating though as it seemed very elitist and we felt we were being looked down upon a bit by the staff.  We were just in casual clothes and that was a shame and I was charged £5 for a glass of water!!  It's probably not a place I would stay as people seem to stay in the riads and it was a shame we were made to feel this way.  But I would do the spa again in a heartbeat!!,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,london,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/holiday73

Royal Mansour Marrakech,nikolfri wrote a review Sep 2016,50,One of the best hotels we've ever been to,Spectacular! When we were shown to our room ( three floor moroccan mini house)  my jaw dropped and I couldn't pick it up for a while. You have your own little garden roof deck with small pool second floor bedroom first floor two livingrooms kitchen and three bathrooms. Moreover there are back doors on each floor for the stuff you don't see them at all. The hotel property is spectacular as well it is a town inside the city. Architecture design and everything else inside the hotel is very well thought out. Its never crowded sometimes i felt like i'm in my own private house. The security is very tight service is impeccable. I think the concierge can literally do anything you ask. This place definitely compensates for the dirt and stench of the medina.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,mpmpmm wrote a review Sep 2016,50,Authentic Oriental Luxury,"We spent a very relaxing weekend at the Royal Mansour. It was like a little village composed of only 53 different 3-story ""buildings/riads"". We had a one-bedroom riad with the living room on the ground floor the bedroom on the second floor and a small private pool on the roof.    The hotel really values the privacy of its clientele so much so that the employees have an underground matrix that allows them to get from one place to another without disturbing the customers. They come into your Riad through a back-door virtually unnoticed.    The breakfast was excellent and it was clear that the staff was very well trained. The gym was really nice and we got to work out a bit. Then we went to the indoor pool and enjoyed the jetted jacuzzi afterwards.    This hotel is great for people who want complete privacy or celebrities. The only con for this hotel understandably is the hefty price tag that comes with the reservation!    It was a memorable experience and to be honest we didn't want to get out of this little haven for the entire weekend - and preferred to just relax at the hotel. The staff and property were both impeccable and this hotel is literally like a shrine to moroccan arts and craftsmanship. This hotel is the epitome of traditional Moroccan architectural luxury. While the rooms are not really my style [i prefer modern over traditional].... it was impossible not to be impressed by the quality of the decor and the impeccable attention to detail. It was really another level and it makes the Sofitel and even the Mamounia look like 2nd tier hotels.

Cannot say enough good things about the staff. From the luggage porter to the concierge to the bartenders and the wait staff and the chefs - incredible service through and through.

Enjoyed both the bars in the evenings even though sometimes we were the only people there. They even let my partner play the baby grand for me. I felt like we were in our private home.

This is a place where you absolutely get what you paid for and more. The riad is on three levels the ground floor had a large dining room for six the mini-bar was majestic and opposite the dining area was a Moroccan salon with tv.

In addition you have walk in dressing area/ wardrobes and again beautifully carved wood tiling and marble surrounds you! The third floor was our sun roof with large dip pool sun loungers and tented area as well as wc and a very beautiful shower. Cleverly designed so even though other riads are very close by you are not overlooked at any point and are assured of absolute privacy.  The food at the hotel - exceptional. We had breakfast in our riad each day and were delighted with fluffy omelettes eggs benedict fresh croissants and pastries breads fruit yoghurts all served by our 'butler' who came with the riad! Lunch and dinners are prepared under the eye of a three Michelin star chef so I need say no more!

We had a VIP pick up at the airport which was superbly handled (reverse on the way out). It took 20 minutes from walking off the plane to checking in at the hotel. Everyone knew our names as we arrived and throughout our stay. It felt very personal.  Every aspect of the hotel is decorated in a very ornate tasteful Moroccan style as you would expect from a hotel owned by the King. Each individual Riad is split over 3 floors and is discretely set apart from each other. Our had a courtyard with fountain toilet two lounges and a kitchen on Dthe first floor the bedroom walk in closet and bathroom on the second floor and a plunge pool sunbathing area a tented chill space kitchen and toilet on the the top floor. Each floor had a discrete entrance for butler service.  The spa was divine and rated as one of the top 20 in the world by the Telegraph. Very professional.  There was a wide breakfast choice and all was cooked and presented well. This was a la carts not buffet style.  We ate in both restaurants - one Moroccan and one French - both supervised by a 3 star Michelin Parisian chef. We chose the sharing or taste menu in both restaurants. The Morrocan was a typical wedding breakfast - each beautifully presented and delicious although far too much for two persons. For the French restaurant we chose a blind menu where the chef chose dishes using best products from the market to our taste. Again this was superb.  Fantastic hotel and one of best hotels we have ever stayed in and that includes many of the top hotels around the world.,Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,horsham,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/boaster

The French Restaurant La Grande Table Française is a very much fine dining experience and very polished with great food and some amazing wines. One of the best wine lists I have ever seen!

Everything in this hotel is just perfect. They have ""riads"" of 1 2 or 3 bedrooms all of them disposed in 3 floors. The smallest ones have 140 m2 or 1500 sq ft. Ask directly at the hotel if you need an elevator. They have one accessible riad of each kind. It is like your own house in a small village. You rarely see other guests as the hotel is very big and has only 53 riads. Very exclusive beautifully decorated using the best of moroccan craftsmanship. The 3 restaurants are amazing serving the best food in town: one french one international and one moroccan. The staff is very well trained and extremely kind always anticipating your needs.

The buildings are beautiful in the style of the medina but with fresh modern architecture. The entrance is gorgeous as are the restaurants. The spa is a temple of light and relaxation with a well equipped gym and Pilates studio and fabulous pool under a domed conservatory. But we loved our Riad most of all: it was set over three stories with a salon bedroom and roof top. The salon and bedroom were beautiful with dark wood and intricate touches and we spent a lot of time on the roof terrace with its plunge pool and fireplace. However what really makes this hotel is the staff. Everyone was very friendly and professional and they got it perfectly right every time.

I'd recommend it to anyone.    After three great stays at the Hotel this time we brought my in-laws. The staff and surroundings were as wonderful as ever. My husband and I were excited to share the Royal Mansour with two people we love and it worked out beautifully. My in-laws can be a handful (they know they're characters and don't mind laughing about it) and the hotel treated them like royalty. The happy senior citizens raved about the details and hospitality. I hope they noticed they were in Marrakech because all they talk about is how amazing the hotel was!    My husband and I will return perhaps next time with friends. It's a spectacular place with stunning details highlighted by a team of lovely people. Thanks to the all at the Mansour for giving us so many wonderful memories!

Royal Mansour Marrakech,Couple_advisor wrote a review Oct 2015,50,From Rags to Riches...,Booked on the net flew with Easyjet but from the moment you are met at the entrance of customs whisked through immigration by a member of Royal Mansour you feel like Royalty.    Our greeter even went behind the baggage belt to find our luggage before the belt had even started!    We were taken to a Range Rover and given the local facts on our way to the hotel. A 15 minute drive.    Greeted by numerous welcoming staff we felt like frauds! Surely this couldn't be just for us?!    The hotel is out of this world set in its own private estate within the medina. Owned by the king and Africa's top hotel and it's evident why.    Every inch of the hotel is covered in detail and beauty.    We arrived at 10.30am and our private riad was ready and waiting with a burning log fire purely for theatre. And that's what this place is theatrical heaven.    Our one bedroom riad covered three floors of serenity. Private and peaceful it felt like our royal retreat.    The ONLY dent in the illusion is the realisation that this hotel is not cheap! And so when you pay so much for breakfast (450 Dirams) you expect impeccable service and on our second morning we were not the only disgruntled hungry couple. Zinadine zidane and his family however were waited on hand and foot.. The staff seemed distracted and if your a football fan then we guess rightly so...    This place is the BEST hotel either of us have ever stayed at. This hotel is beyond a dream.    It's not cheap but sometimes life is too short.

I never thought for one moment that a place on earth could be so grand so refined yet it was found at Royal Mansour. This spectacle which took over 1000 artisans working around the clock 4 years to complete will dazzle your imagination. Our 3 story riad had no detail forsaken or overlooked. We used the concierge to book an English-speaking guide named 'Bin Bin' for the day. Truly invaluable! Our request to heat our personal roof deck pool was no problem. Enjoyed evenings on our pool deck with the fireplace and a bottle of our favorite wine. Our visit in late September was off-season so the surroundings were quiet private and enjoyable. Meals are an additional cost but be prepared to have your taste buds tantalized by the French Moroccan or Mediterranean restaurants on site. The 3-star Michelin chef was in Paris during our stay yet the food and services were impeccable. Be prepared to experience white-glove service where requesting a cup of tea is a presentation to behold.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,MOKAMAMA wrote a review Sep 2015,40,What a lovely hotel,So when we booked we were hoping for a resort in Marrakesh. While the hotel is incredibly beautiful and the service perfect I wish I had stayed either in the middle of the Medina or out in the Palmerai. The house we stayed in was lovely and had a little dipping pool on the roof. The main pool is really not welcoming and feel odd where it is located. It would be nice if there was a more casual dining area by the pool and if it were more populated. The grounds are occupied by other hotel rooms/ riads so you cannot walk around the grounds without having a destination. There are no gardens within the walls or outdoor spaces to relax in. We always went straight to our riad to relax. So I think my concept of a resort in the city was not really met. The Mansour seems like the perfect place to literally retreat and not be seen. Perfect for the Princess of Thailand who was staying there while we were. Not so perfect for me.,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,Altadena,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MOKAMAMA
Royal Mansour Marrakech,Adriano B wrote a review Sep 2015,50,"It does not get better than this, my friends.",I'm a fairly sophisticated and seasoned traveller focused on unique experiences across the globe and on unique properties. I spend a weekend with my family at the Royal Mansour and am pretty compelled to say this is best hotel experience one can find in the whole of Africa and certainly one of the most amazing hotel properties in the world.    I believe it takes a very specific type of guest in order to fully appreciate the splendour and full potential of this property as the RM is not a standard luxuty hotel. They're a private palace with royal-type service and unthinkable beauty.    Every single architectural/interior decor attraction in Marrakesh pales in comparison with the RM. You wont want to leave the property. Words cannot describe the level of details and beauty of every corner of the hotel. Hat's off.    The service is another amazing highlight. They're at the top on a global scale. The personal butler for you rhiad will virtually do anything to create a unique and unforgettable stay. Roasted lamb (delicious) dinner on the terrace with hundreds of candles? no problem. Wine tasting with amazing stem ware and absolutely perfect wine service. Every type of small surprises for my children. And all this with a type of friendly warm attitude that is very hard to find these days. Creativity is required from the guest at the Royal Mansour or you'll leave value on the table.    Service outside of the hotel is even more impressive. Their set up in Marrakesh is unbeatable. At the airport they will make your life 100% hassle free both on the arrival and departure - and this is huge in Marrakesh. I felt like a US ambassador being whizzed from one ultra fast track to another. Their guides are amazing a true encyclopaedia of all things Marrakesh. They have access to the hidden attractions shops ateliers etc which guarantees a visit to become unforgettable. Make full use of the concierge and guides as they're the best in the city by a long distance. Again here your imagination is the limit as to what can be arranged.    The food is excellent. I only ate Moroccan cuisine so I can't opine on Alleno's cuisine there. The lamb and the tagines there are spiritual quality stuff. The wine list while not cheap is full of amazing wines you can only find in the best michelin restaurants in Paris NYC London.    The Spa is surreal. I'm not a big fan of spending too much time in a spa but there at the RM I felt obliged to. Amazing hamman and suites for couples whcih can be rented for half or full day. Amazing couple experience here.    Two pools. The covered one is amazingly beautiful and atmospheric. Crucial for the very hot days.    Location is perfect very close to the center and less than 10min from the airport.    In summary I believe this is the right choice for those who are looking for the ultimate Marrakesh luxury experience but also must have the stamina and knowledge to explore all the potential of the hotel and its services. The premium over the Mammounia is easily justifiable and worth it as they are worlds apart in every sense.,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/503adrianob

The staff are world class (the concierges especially noteworthy) and the decor is astonishingly beautiful and the outdoor space is wonderfully landscaped.    The French restaurant is a wonderful ""secret"" (in that it's not listed in Trip Advisor) where you get food cooked by a three star Michelin chef from Paris and can have the entire restaurant to yourself as we did. You'd need months of lead in time just to get a table at his Paris establishment. Instead hope on a plane and you could dine at his Marrakesh restaurant tomorrow! Needless to say the Roos was astonishing fabulous with wine pairings to match.    My ""best"" hotel in the world for a long time has been Las Ventanas in Los Cabos Mexico.

The only downside was if you have mobility problems you might find the accommodation being on 3 floorsdifficult.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,massimiliano wrote a review Jun 2015,50,Perfection,For those who had the patience to read my boring reviews I always said that I am not a traveller but more a luxury tourist....well Royal Mansour was my paradise.  Since the moment you land at Menara airport every single details has been carefully checked by the staff of the hotel. Maybe hotel is not the right definition as every single room is a riad with a butler individual swimming pool and a lot of amenities and you have more the feeling to live and enjoy a riad in the medina more than a luxury hotel.  I loved to have the breakfast in my terrace enjoying the beauty of the gardens surrounding the property but the area where the breakfast is served in nice too. Facing the main swimming pool is an oasis of calm and peace..  The spa is simply perfection. I had a private hamman and was gorgeous. The moroccan restaurant I super expensive but for sure the best food in town.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,aimeefay28 wrote a review Jun 2015,50,Just wow....,This place is stunning!! My friend and I visited this month and fell in love with it the second we pulled up. The lovely door men opened our doors on the car and greeted us which made us feel so welcome. A lovely lady gave us a tour of the inside and around the riads at the back. Every member of staff we passed said hello and asked how we were which I find so polite. We stayed for a drink in the bar (drinks are a little pricey at 250-300 Dirhams a cocktail) but most definitely worth it! The cocktails were freshly made and come with little nibbles of chocolates fruit jellies cashew nuts and olives. The waiters were so polite and made us feel so welcome. Unfortunately we went at night time so we couldn't see the gardens in day time and really appreciate it. However from what we did see inside and out this place is a beauty!

Royal Mansour Marrakech,Kate_London_123 wrote a review Jun 2015,50,Royal Indeed!,Royal indeed!    Let me start by saying that I haven’t stayed in this hotel as a guest nor did I have a meal there. I simply happened to walk by and wanted to take a photo of its inner yard. I was noticed by a member of staff who did not ask me out quite the opposite she asked me if I wanted to have a look around. I didn’t know what it was and she explained to me that it is a hotel. Stepping into the hotel (I think the word Palace would describe it better) grounds my breath was taken away! It is definitely the most beautiful hotel I have ever seen. Staff was friendly and let me walk around with my camera taking shots of the hotel I am happy to publish few photos here on Tripadvisor.    Lavish yet elegant opulent yet practical this place is a true craftsmanship masterpiece. Every detail every piece of furniture it utterly regal yet usable and approachable. I marvelled at every painting and every tile. I can’t express how gorgeous this place looks. Needless to say everything is spotlessly clean and hotel staff takes great pride in their work.    New fabrics materials and styles meet old tradition in its elegant décor it is not overpowering but it is quite intense. I felt so much respect for people who put all the little details together to create such a wow factor.    Royal Mansour has 2 beautiful restaurants (one Moroccan and one French) Moroccan being with more intricate décor and French being more minimalistic yet elegant and stylish. The fresh flower bouquets were fragrant and nicely put together. This place is like a fairy tale fit for a princes.    Royal Mansour has a nice library a bar an outdoor swimming pool with beautiful sun loungers.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,DCY wrote a review May 2015,50,Wow,Over the top luxury. The quality of everything in the construction is amazing--leather padded walls in the bedroom tile work design. Then add in perfect service just a world class hotel.  Pros-above plus food in the international and french restaurants. The French restaurant was elegant quiet with excellent food and service wine pairings were spot on with a great somm. Expensive though--$500/person.  Cons--The 3 story riads get a little tiring after a day or so it seems like you are climbing the stairs constantly. The plunge pool/upper deck area is a little boring decor wise after the rest of the interior. They also are skimpy on the towels limited to 3 towels in the bathroom. Expensive to a crazy extent--$27 martinis $17 beers $45 for a glass of champagne ? Charged $10 to make a collect call in my room. I also thought the Moroccan restaurant food was very mediocre although again the staff was excellent.  Went to La Mamounia for a drink and was glad I stayed at Royal Mansour--totally different atmosphere--more hotel/resort like as well as more stuffy and dark.,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Des Moines, Iowa",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/626dony

Royal Mansour Marrakech,rmariff wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Ultimate luxury. Period.,Morocco is one of my favourite country in the world although the visa application process is less than desirable.    This time we had the great opportunity to stay at the ultra luxurious Royal Mansour for 2 nights.    First thing first; no other hotel can match the Royal Mansour. The architecture service food facilities are all super high end. Its not great when you kept comparing your next hotel with this one.    As many reviewers have noted you get a whole riad for the price you pay which consisted of 2 levels and a rooftop plunge pool. The view out to the Atlas Mountains is spectacular. The room is vast beds very comfortable and the bathroom is beautiful.    We were there to celebrate my sister and my brother's birthdays and the staff made it extra special by arranging a birthday cake for them during one of our dinners at the Le Table Morocaine. The food was scrumptious.    The whole hotel complex is magical with fruit trees palms and little waterways in between the riads. The Spa is a must visit even if you are not a guest. Try the hammam or the massages. The pedicure is not as great as its only a dry pedicure treatment and not the spa pedicure. Thats the only glitch I do hope they will consider to upgrade the mani and pedi treatments to the spa version.    We dined in all the restaurants at Royal Mansour. My favourite is the La Table Francais. The service is outstanding and elaborate with courses after courses. The food is simply sublime.    Kids Club; big area with several activities every day. My daughter had fun there. They have snacks on offer which is a plus point.    The riad is like a small palace and you are made to feel like you are princes and princesses with the stunning surrounding and immaculate service. You do not want to leave and if you eventually have to leave you'll be thinking of the next time you are staying here again.    Should you have a special occasion to celebrate this is THE perfect place.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,JPA38210 wrote a review Jan 2015,50,THE SPA AT ROYAL MANSOUR - A DREAM,I was in Marrakech for a much-needed three-week break - my 30th visit since the mid-1980s. I had heard of this fabulous hotel but as I had not visited the city for a few years had not seen it. Meandering into town one day from the Hivernage residential just outside the city by a tranquil short-cut there was the hotel's spa (and even more discreetly a 100 metres further on the hotel's main entrance). I recalled a raving review regarding the Hamman so popped in for 'a menu'. This was eye wateringly expensive but I threw caution to the wind and booked a hamman for an hour followed by a massage for the same period. It was the complete pampering experience. I was treated like a king and came out floating on air and feeling and feeling and looking 10 years younger. Albeit the the same weight I was £240 lighter. Worth it?

Royal Mansour Marrakech,StacyBA wrote a review Dec 2014,50,Height of Luxury,Royal Mansour is a resort unlike any other I have seen. The resorts uncompromising and unwavering desire for reclusive privacy for their clients cannot be matched. So much so that upon reaching the hotel I missed the entrance to the side street that it was located on. I took Boulevard Al Yarmouk from La Mamounia and walked right past the entry street on the right. Heading towards Cyber Parc Moulay which the hotel backs up to on one side I knew I was close. I hailed a cab and laughed at the bemused expression on the taxi driver's face when I asked her to take me to Royal Mansour. I knew it was right there but couldn't see it. She shrugged her shoulders and said o.k. We went approximately two minutes down Avenue Mohammed V.    The exclusivity and privacy of this resort stems from its purpose in design. The reflection of a small medina housing 53 riads was specifically designed by King Mohammed VI to house the royal family's guests. Stepping into the walled medina and moving through the vast labyrinth of passageways to each medina I wondered how guests were able to find their home for the next few days. But this was the fun of it. It truly represented the medina so close in proximity to the resort itself. The only thing it lacked were the water bearers snake charmers and juice stands.    There were two bellmen upon entry onto the property and even though they were gracious and friendly I couldn't help get the sense that they were also intent on watching for anything out of the ordinary. The lobby is a work of art. In tune with the traditional riad-style the lobby had an open atrium with rooms to the side. The center of the entryway as seen here was beautiful. The perfectly placed roses within the water feature was an exquisite touch and added the texture and color needed. The hotel lobby consists of these seating areas. As you can see the height of the ceiling as well as the openness of the courtyard brings in quite a bit of light. The details of the design are mesmerizing.    Yannick Alleno the Michelin starred chef supervises the hotel's three restaurants La Grande Table Marocaine La Grande Table Francaise La Table. Each offering distinctive meals themed nights and entertainment. As you enter the lobby the Moroccan restaurant and the French restaurant flank each side of the courtyard The food was wonderful of course. The pictures below are of the appetizer and dessert portion of a meal. They have a designated pastry chef that can customize the pastries present. We were only one of two guest dining at that moment. Service was impeccable.    Moving into the interior of the property the maze of alleyways appear and if you did not have a staff member directing you I would think many of a guest have gotten lost in trying to locate their riad upon first arrival. When found though it is sheer luxury that awaits when opening the door. No detail has been left untouched including the retractable ceiling that can be operated by the touch of a button. Each one to four bedroom riad has three floors of living space. Each are designed around the open-air courtyard and has a lobby outdoor sitting area living room and bar. Additionally the larger riads have a dining room and a gallery. Another extraordinary design feature were the behind-the-scenes tunnels that connected each of the riads that the staff members us in order to service their guests. The ultimate in discretion allows guests the highest level of privacy.    One of the best features and a major selling point would be the rooftop terraces. Each have a plunge pool lounging area with a fireplace and the larger riads come with Bedouin tents as well as a personal hammam! The views are spectacular overlooking the park and Koutoubia Mosque. This would be a perfect place to unwind at the end of the day or even spend a whole day!    The spa is true decadence. The entry way is bordered by running water as if you are crossing a bridge into another world. Once entering the spa you are transported into a dream-like whimsical setting with white-infused walls floors and decor. The latticed wrought iron design in the seating area mimics a bird-cage design carrying that same fanciful mood throughout. These alcoves enable guests to sit for their initial consultation where a personalized line of treatment is suggested. The spa also spans three floors of treatment areas. The ground floor houses two hammams a salon private treatment rooms as well as a second floor offering private rooms for couples. It also has a roof top terrace for a place to relax between treatments. There is also an indoor swimming pool for spa guests. The spa uses leading beauty brands such as MarocMaroc Dr Hauschka and Sisley for facials and body treatments with Chanel facials and make up also available. Leonor Greyl products are used in the hairdressing salon.    Overall this property is true luxury at its finest. Every detail exquisitely handcrafted and intentionally designed to exude the level of clientele it was originally designed for. In choosing this property though clients should understand that at the level of privacy offered and the limited number of riads it is a very quiet resort. This is not a place to see or be seen. Clients for this property are looking for privacy and discretion. With that said I did see a family with young children. I can imagine they were seeking the comforts of home for their children. This would be a very private family by nature though because even with a kid's club on property I can't imagine there being enough children on property at one given time for it to be interesting.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Porto, Portugal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StacyBA

The hotel is not ""a splurge"" because their service quality and space is arguably worth more than the price paid. The staff (housekeeper driver etc) are so polite well-trained competent and spoke great English when compared to other hotel's staffs in Marrakech (we also stayed at Palais Namaskar & La Villa des Orangers).    Your Riad: Beautiful 3-story riad all to yourself. After visiting so many Kasbahs and historical sites throughout Morocco this hotel blew all those away with all the intricate hand-made details of the place. Despite all the elegance the riad also was very functional comfortable (feels like a home!) and technologically advance.    The location is also excellent as you can see from the map. It is right inside the Medina but it has its own private gate for the hotel guests.    We felt very pampered and well-taken care of from the moment we arrived with the welcoming team greeting us all the way through the check-out and even at the airport! Our driver took us through check-in and handed us over to another airport staff that took us through custom formalities and security bypassing all queues all the way to the VIP lounge. Then the lounge staff took us to airplane gate to board our flight. While this VIP airport service is similar to what you could receive at other countries Royal Mansour's service stood out because of the extend of how much they take care of you - from the moment you step outside of your Riad all the way to stepping on the plane.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,JonathanKingOfHits wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Fabulous experience,About 50 years ago as a young student I first visited Marrakech staying at a tiny hotel (Jasmin?) which had no pool. I was directed around the corner to the Piscine Municipale. Absolutely packed with locals. Impossible to swim but fantastic to watch. Now half a century later it's been demolished and rebuilt as this luxury hotel owned by the King. I swam in a gorgeous empty pool and had delicious tea of lemon cheesecake apple tart and Earl Grey. The place is beautiful calm spectacular and very expensive. Chatted at length with the staff. Well worth your pennies.,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JonathanKingOfHits
Royal Mansour Marrakech,Weegschaal wrote a review May 2014,50,What a great hotel,I've stayed at the Royal Mansour for 4 nights and can only talk positive about this hotel.    It already started at the airport where an employee of the hotel waited for us to direct us to the business lounge. After recieving drinks a limousine was waiting to bring us to the hotel.    Hotel is stunning and very beautiful. Our riad was wonderful and all of moroccon craftmanship is shown here. You have 3 stories... A living room bedroom and enormous bathroom ( the bath was even for me (1.96m) huge). And you also have a private terrace with swimming pool on the roof.    Staff is very nice and helpfull whatever you want they arrange it. I wanted to play golf on a course that wasn't open yet to the public and they arranged it for us.    Food is great ( tried La Table and the Morrocon restaurant) and also breakfast is sublime ( le pain perdu is one of the best i've ever had) in the moroccon restaurant portions are huge.    Final comment : great hotel and I will definitly go back,Date of stay: May 2014,,"Nieuwpoort, Belgium",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Weegschaal
Royal Mansour Marrakech,raymontecarlo wrote a review May 2014,30,Visit to Moroccan restaurant very pricey disappointing.,We went to the Royal Mansour to try the Grand Table Moroccan  Restaurant .  The setting is impressive and we sat down in the very grand surroundings.  Service was most polite but slow .  The pastille was good but the rest not worth the wait.  The shoulder of Lamb was tasteless .  The mixed salad starter was tiny and also poor compared to what else is locally available.  The ambience is good.  However the cost is above London prices so value wise  not worth it.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,R S wrote a review May 2014,50,Treated like royalty.,This is the most lavish stunning jaw dropping hotel I've ever been in and we've stayed in the top resorts and hotels all over the world. To call it a hotel is almost misleading and it feels more like you are on palatial grounds...and then the doors swing open to your own private 3 or 4 story (I lost count) riad. Ground floor stunning terraces lounging alcoves stunning living room powder room service kitchen second floor 3 walkin closets master bedroom a killer master bath 3rd floor rooftop pool fireplace lounging areas. The staff mysteriously appears out of nowhere...always white glove. We ended up canceling some dinner reservations as our riad was so beautiful we preferred to stay in and have room service.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,pmsnowdon wrote a review May 2014,50,Stunning decor and ambience... everyone must have a drink here!,We only learned of the hotel via our concierge who said we must visit this hotel owned by the King himself. There are two restaurants French and Moroccan. We didn't eat but visited for drinks as we wanted to checkout the supposed best hotel in Marrakech... and it was incredible. It was the finest example of Berber/Moroccan design we had seen and the word 'exquisite' doesn't even do the place justice.    We visited for drinks before moving on to another restaurant. Drinks are very expensive... think top London hotel prices (£22 for a small Cosmopolitan cocktail) but it was worth it. Definitely recommended... simply stunning.    As an aside the restaurants looked quiet which is what we feared so didn't book BUT if you can tell me the restaurant does get busy and has a great atmosphere I will endeavour to visit next year.,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Shropshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pmsnowdon

Royal Mansour Marrakech,Catriya wrote a review Apr 2014,40,The spa and dining experience was divine...,The spa at the Royal Mansour was jaw droppingly beautiful. A quiet unprepossessing corridor led to a room with enormously high ceilings and separate alcove waiting areas seprated by beautiful bird-cage like structures in white. We arrived 2 hours early to relax in the pool and were greeted by lovely staff. They lost my reservation (I booked for an hour of hammam and a facial) and was told I had only booked a hammam but that was quite quickly sorted out and I got what I wanted after several rounds of speaking to the staff. The pool was set in an enormous greenhouse with high glass ceilings which let the light in and kept the temperature nice and warm. The courtyard outside was filled with lemon trees which were pretty and kept the place looking beautiful and green.    The real fun started when we were led in luxuriously thick fuzzy bathrobes to the hammam and scrubbed within an inch of our lives with a gorgeously thick black soap on an almost unbearably hot marble slab. Once clean I was offered a fresh robe and ushered into a gorgeous waiting room with daybeds and hot tea and fluffy pillows and sheets. My facial was the best I have ever had. I had the purifying facial using maroc maroc products and the extraction hardly hurt which is a surprise. They didn't have availibility in the ordinary rooms so we were upgraded to the spa suite. A super confortable bed/chair was positioned directly underneath a skylight conveniently shaded from the searing afternoon sun. You can watch the clouds scudding lazily by as luxurious products are smoothed onto your skin. The sun was shining (but not in your eyes) the birds were singing (and none of them were doing it too loudly to preventing you from having a bit of a snooze). It felt like unicorns and fairies were consipring to make me truly happy. It was an unbelievable experience.    They lost my dinner reservation (as well as mucking up my spa reservation!) but everything turned out well as they were able to squeeze us in at the Moroccan Restaurant. Again the unicorns and fairies were hard at work because dinner was divine. Yes the 50 euro flute of champagne was exorbitant as was the 25 euro glass of fruit juice but the chicken tagine was divine and the orange pearls for dessert (little pearls which exploded with fresh orange juice when you bit into them) were sublime. Staff were charming and very hospitable genuinely getting excited about introducing specialities and making sensible recommendations.    We were a little sad to see our humble little taxi motoring its way along the drive alongside the bentleys and rolls royces to take us back to our Riad but I'll be back one day to try out the hotel,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Catriya

We were given a tour around the Royal Mansour prior to our dinner--the library the spa the cigar room the bar...everything was beautiful. Each room they walked us through had us in awe of all the details meticulously put in. La Grande Table Francaise is a place if you want to have dinner in an opulent majestic setting. Service is impeccable. The food is pricey but the food was outstanding. Fresh local truffles that they showed us. The Wagyu beef melts in your mouth and the chicken breast was cooked perfectly that it was still juicy and tender. The entire meal was delicious no complaints whatsoever. At the end of the meal the chef came out and introduced himself.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,Hildawho wrote a review Feb 2014,50,Every single exquisite detail left me in awe,This review is for LA GRANDE TABLE MAROCAINE one of 3 restaurants at Royal Mansour Hotel. First walking through the hotel... I have never before seen such beauty in a hotel's grounds and interior. Every single exquisite detail left me in awe. I felt this was what royalty must experience as every turn revealed more intricate beauty and elegance. Next a drink... The bar's lounge was silver golden and pearly decorated in the roaring 20s fashion. It had to have been the most expensive mixed drink I ever had at about $40 but I was intoxicated with the surroundings.. is this heaven? The way to the restrooms is magical with mosaics reflecting pool and fountains and drapes and drapes of silk curtains. Finally dinner... again down to the finest detail the silverware the candle lights the china the staff with gloved hands the music being played just at the right volume tempo and tunes... WOW! This is opulence I've never experienced before. I have to mention the staff again - they were incredibly professional discreet and attentive. I ordered the mixed salads and they were very good though I must admit Fatima at our riad topped them. The bread was fantastic and the butter was even delicately seasoned. Overall everyone had very good meals but the absolute winner was the pigeon pastilla. Wow! Unfortunately I didn't order this but after my friend generously offered a bite I wanted to jump over the table with my fork and knife wielded and gobble it all up. That certainly would have broken the magic of the scene. It was already quite a memorable night.,Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Chicago, Illinois",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hildawho
Royal Mansour Marrakech,TheLadyinRed03 wrote a review Feb 2014,40,Good food in opulent setting,We chose to eat our last dinner in Morocco here at the advice of our guide who thought we would appreciate seeing the stunning architecture in the central public spaces. Indeed the riad is absolutely stunning. What a meticulous renovation.    We very much enjoyed a relaxing drink in the main bar before heading to dinner at La Grande Table Marocain.    Dinner here was delicious but the food wasn’t any more delicious than other restaurants charging significantly less. Moreover service was a bit clumsy and unprofessional at this price point. My husband and I joked that this is probably not only the most expensive restaurant in Morocco but likely on the entire continent of Africa. While I’m happy that these prices enable the riad to employ so many people it was tough to see the “value-proposition” of desserts that cost $40. For reference our meal here cost more than many 3-Michelin restaurants where we’ve dined and the food was not at those levels. It was very good but again you can get equally good food at for instance La Maison Arabe (where we stayed and also where we enjoyed an outstanding New Year’s Eve dinner tasting menu).,Date of stay: January 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheLadyinRed03
Royal Mansour Marrakech,Walter N wrote a review Feb 2014,50,Living the life of Riley,Grandeur and opulence are the first thoughts coming to mind when passing through the gate of Royal Mansour. It truly is a good rendition of someone's imagination of a palace out of 1001 nights. We had dinner at the Moroccan restaurant serving indigenous dishes at perfection. The service was attentive without being obtrusive. However the staff easily outnumbered the guests as it did in all restaurants and bars of the hotel. There is a great wine list but be aware of sticker shock as a meal for two can easily run in excess of $ 500.00.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,TravelingHT wrote a review Dec 2013,50,Dining Heaven!!,Pure heaven!!!! Without doubt the best meal I have every had ANYWHERE in the world.    After being seated in a w beautifully decorated room and sipping on a champagne I had the  sharing menu:    The starter was salads bot 3 or 4 but 7 salads. Heaven #1 - a toss up between the spinach with orange blossom foam and the beetroot orange - beetroot jelly and marinated orange all red and rich yet fresh and light!! The spinach was fresh salad spinach served in orange foam and tiny chunks of orange. Eggplant cannelloni! The tiniest most tender baby Artichoke caramelised in carrot! Pumpkin and dates with nuts crunch and then super smoky and delicious peppers and eggplant; and a not so humble tomato cucumber and green pepper salad each time 3x3 mm cube exactly the same size!    I've been travelling all around Morocco for the last 7 weeks in search of the perfect Pastillia and I just found it!!!! The Royal Pastillia. The fluffiest filo I have EVER eaten anywhere in the world (and I get around) succulent and rich pigeon (at least 3-4 pigeons I expect due to the amount of meat) and nuts / almond meal. With just the right amount of sweetness although I do admit to removing some of the icing sugar....    Next came the tagines: the piece de resistance: lamb shoulder Mechoui style - lamb shoulder - cooked for 26 hours!!! Steamed and then crisped up in the oven and you sprinkle salt and cumin on it to your taste!!! Seriously melt in the mouth! I eat lamb all the time and this was the most delicious lamb I have ever eaten!!! chicken with olives / lemon tagine was not the standard fare but a very refined smoothe version with the onions olives and lemon cooked till a soft almost purée sauce. And to top it off vegetable couscous with gentle tomato dripping sauce that comes with all good couscous.    Dessert - often goes wrong in different countries. Not this time. Royal Mansiur Orange Pearls - multiple tiny Orange exploding balls of juice and flavour sitting on a soft orange jelly/ puree topped with a slither of date and a tiny mint leaf in a delicate orange foam. Topped with a sprinkle of cinnamon.    Next amulu ice cream and a delicate Afgan oil chocolate crunchy gateaux with a ganache of Afgan oil and preserved lemon.    And of course tiny thumb nail size moroccan pastries - dates pistatio and white chocolate and a crunch tiny drop of a pastry with the odd sesame seed and a touch of Annis.    All washed down with a lovely glass of champagne and a coffee!

Royal Mansour Marrakech,Brum74 wrote a review Sep 2013,50,simply sublime.,We ate at the French restaurant at Royal Mansour on our recent trip to Marrakech. I can't find a separate listing for the restaurant so I am posting this here. I had read lots about this hotel but nothing could prepare me for how beautiful this place really is.    Right – let’s get the easy (but painful) bit out of the way. This place is expensive. Very expensive.    Now that I have cleared that up I must say the experience food ambience decor and service meant that our bill was worth every last Dirham.    Upon arrival through grand entrance gates you are greeted by doormen who were very friendly and helpful. Then another person greets you to take you through to the restaurant or if preferred a bar to have a pre-dinner cocktail. The way to the bar is through the lobby – and it is gorgeous. The staff member was very knowledgeable about the building its contents etc.    We were shown two bars – both beautifully and facing each other. The piano bar has a pianist playing and was beautiful but we opted for the other bar as we could still hear the piano. There were about 4 other couples in there and it had a lovely atmosphere.    A couple of excellent cocktails later we were taken seamlessly through to the restaurant. We were surprised we were the only ones in there but it didn’t matter at all. We just had the most amazing restaurant to ourselves.    We opted for the a la carte menu and I had prawns followed by the lobster with a light ginger broth. Absolutely amazing. My partner had guinea fowl which he declared one of the best emails he had ever eaten. They provided lots of little things to eat in between courses. The food the wine and service were all beyond doubt the best I have ever experienced.    We told the waiters how wonderful the evening was and they invited us back the next day to have a look around the hotel and gardens. We took them up on the invitation and were shown around by guest services manager Badr. Badr was the friendliest most knowledgeable member of hotel staff I have ever met – and we weren’t even staying there! He showed us around let us see a couple of guest rooms (all individual riads and extremely well appointed) and firmly implanted in my brain the idea that I need (must) to return as a guest. Our sincere thanks to Badr and the amazing restaurant team.    If you really enjoy fine dining and can afford the splurge then I would honestly say just do so.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,wholewideworld wrote a review Apr 2013,50,Magical Mansour. A compound with a few barriers.,"If you're lucky enough to stay in a private and beautifully appointed three story Riad perhaps gratitude overrides most criticism. With that said the pros: the compound is spectacular with lush plants fountains jasmine/orange scents and gasp-inducing design. Passing time in our Riad was like staying in a glorious museum or King's guest house. The details were astounding from the fountain in our tiled courtyard ornate painted panels opulent ceilings three bathrooms (two half baths) three staircases two fireplaces lanterns galore sizable private plunge pool and roof deck. One could write decor essays about each room from the pillows to the tile work to the gigantic ""dressing rooms."" The Riads could easily sway tourists to forget the city of Marrakech all together. The included breakfasts were delightful feasts served expertly on the outdoor patio under palm trees. It is a short walk from the Mansour to the Medina. We had one issue with a private tour guide which was generously corrected by the gracious head concierge and hotel manager. Cons: Keep your wallet wide open. There is a lack of variety for in-hotel dining and no casual or light menu though the food was excellent - particularly when served on our private rooftop among the lanterns. Employees everywhere greeted guests politely but many had trouble understanding French or English causing some laughable then irritating mix-ups. Some of the staff was not as finely tuned as hotel itself. Their kindness helped diffuse occasional frustrations but there were a lot of clueless three star moments in this five star palace. Tips: If you get to stay at the Mansour walk in with clear questions and work your way up the chain until you find suitable answers. Very little explanation was given regarding the inner workings of our Riad and we didn't realize the array of services included in-room until the end of our stay. The complimentary VIP airport services are lovely in theory though there was no communication whatsoever about how the process works. We were whisked here and there not knowing what was to come while porters took our passports and instructed us to wait. All said the Mansour is utterly unique. Sitting in a private tented cabana under vast blue skies while hearing the mysterious calls to prayer over hundreds of bird songs is transformative. Skipping down your own marble staircases just to wander the rooms explore your gifts of fresh fruit and dried figs or to feel the Moroccan breeze through your courtyard...well...perhaps some fantasy vacations can happen without leaving your own room.",Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wholewideworld

We went in one evening for a pre-dinner cocktail and sat in the rose gold bar room. The cocktails we chose were 'signature' and lovely. There was live piano music filtering and it was a great way to start our evening. So why only 4 stars? Down to service mainly it was probably just bad timing but we were sat in the bar for quite a while before someone came to take a drinks order (we helped ourselves to menu's in the end) and then there was some confusion with calling a car to take us on to our restaurant (they gave ours to someone else so we had to wait for another one).

Royal Mansour Marrakech,AlastairCookieNYC wrote a review Nov 2012,20,Spa - gorgeous to look at but a disappointing & frustrating experience,"I wanted to experience a traditional hammam scrub and also to see and experience the design of the Royal Mansour Spa. It comes highly rated in many places. I was extremely disappointed. It was the only hammam treatment I did in Marrakech so I can only compare it to spa experiences in other countries (Japanese baths Korean Spa scrubs regular western high end spa experiences in the USA UK Australia) and this fell short in terms of my overall satisfaction.    It was by far the most expensive treatment in town. I knew that when I chose it. 1400Dirhams for a 60 minute traditonal scrub plus I chose to tip 10% as the treatment people were nice and competent at their part of the experience. Fatema was my scrubber and she was warm friendly & made me feel comfortable.    One thing that was annoying - at the end of my treatment I was wrapped in my wet towel then my bathrobe wrapped on top then my very wet hair clipped on top of my head - I was starting to get a bit cold then led upstairs to the ""relaxtion room"" where I could lounge and read magazines (none in English none of any quality all trashy - I flipped through French Glamour. I did my best to be patient & enjoy myself when all I wanted to do was take off the wet layers (ill-fitting treatment thong wet towel wet hair wet robe) and put some moisturizer on my face. I waited 10 mins for my tea then drank some so by the time I got downstairs I was colder than I wanted to be and my face had completely dehydrated. In the scrub they scrub you face too so it was stripped clean and they apply no moisture layer to you. By the time I got downstairs to the change rooms where the Dr Haushka face moisturizer was available I had a very badly peeling nose and my body skin was drying out on the extremities. I blow dried my hair slathered my whole body in Dr Hauskka products then was very ready to leave.    Overall complaints. Lack of common sense in the staff. No-one shows you around the premises - you are supposed to be allowed to use the sauna the pool the jacuzzi before your treatment yet when I got there 40 minutes early (they told me to arrive 30 minutes early on the phone) no-one knew who I was why I was there & I was left sitting for 5 minutes (with a beverage which is nice). It took me a bit to realized no-one was coming to help me and I explained who I was. I was told somewhat indignantly that I was early which I thought was rude and defensive and not a professional start. Then I asked to do the sauna and was told it was not turned on could I wait. I said fine I will swim for 10 mins. After swimming and showering 20 minutes later I asked to sauna and was met with some inexplicable resistance but I was insistent as I was feeling very cold. The pool is heated but not that warm. I get to the sauna and it is not turned on I am told to sit and wait again by a new staff member. I get angry and say I had been told the sauna was turned on 25 minutes ago he says sorry let em go find out. I am left alone cold and wet under my robe and after 5 minutes I go upstairs and say you know what I think I will just leave. This is ridiculous and I am not having a good time. I am not relaxed. I am cold. This is a terrible US$200 experience so far and just not acceptable. Then a very sweet woman apologizes a lot and talks me into staying then Karim the hairstylist smooths everything over with his EXCELLENT manner. He is an asset to them really good sense of how to handle customers I relaxed in his chair while he applied coconut oil to my hair.    The Scrub:  If you like Korean style body scrub this is not for you. This scrub experience is very very mild. You receive one mild going over with the exfoliating glove and a black soap. It's fine but notjhing I couldn't do myself it is not particularly thorough or vigorous (unlike a Korean scrub where you see old dead skin coming off you in gray fragments and ribbons this is mild to the point of ineffectual). Then some ""mask"" (looked like scrub again) is placed all over you but not rubbed in just left to sit on you then washed off. Then some gelatinous moisturizing layer is added to you and you lie there some more. Then your face is scrubbed and your hair is washed. You are lying down on hard marble the entire time. My low back ached by the end. My neck ached from when I was lying face down on the marble. There is a towel folded like a pillow but marble is hardly a comfortable surface for an entire hour.    Overall I was shocked by how many people there are in spa uniforms all being super sweet and sort of trying to ""help you"" being and friendly and warm while everything just seems really illogical & you dont feel well served. I suspect the size and physical functioning of the space that is not helping the staff - the fact that it is divided over 2 floors and has a lot of rooms but still perhaps it is also the system in place by management on how to flow a guest in and out of a treatment? Perhaps it is poor training - no-one seems to have service industry common sense. Whatever it is I had a really rocky and expensive experience only salvaged by Karim's efficiency and good service instincts and then Fatima's ability to make me comfortable (it's not her fault I think the scrub is just not a thorough treatment I dont think it was her application I think it is just the nature of this kind of scrub - too mild for my taste).    To top it all off on my way out a nice receptionist was accompanying me to the main door to outside. She had just given me directions to my hotel and we were walking in comfortable silence down a long and poorly lit corridor and it did not occur to her to point out that there are lots of shallow wide steps and I did not see them. I twisted my ankle and almost fell. It was a moderate twist 3 hours later it still throbs a bit plus I spasmed my back from the jar/jolting action if stumbling so at the time I just stood still on 1 leg for 2 mins waiting to be able to put weight on it agaon. She offered to get me a cab but I really really wanted to leave. So again - the complete lack of service common sense caused me to have a bad experience in this case in the form of an injury. It seems obvious to me - a client new to the space who arrived in the day and leaving by night plus relaxed post spa-treatment it seems only common sense to say ""Please be careful there is a step here and a few more ahead"". She was perfectly nice but nice didn't stop me from tripping. Common sense and proactiveness would. With all of the reception staff at this spa there seems to be no service instinct or common sense beyond the warm smiles.",Date of stay: November 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,NYC,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlastairCookieNYC

Royal Mansour Marrakech,happytraveler00 wrote a review Nov 2012,30,"Royal, but not comfortable",There is no question that the Royal Mansour is among the most beautiful hotels perhaps the most beautiful hotel that we have ever stayed in. Every surface is hand decorated by Moroccan craftsmen and no detail is overlooked. It is a remarkable place to stay. However it is an extremely formal environment and every little thing you might want while available is charged at a ridiculous rate. A cola from the minibar is $10; a sandwich from room service is $50. The negative reviews one regarding the restaurant asking someone to leave for failing to dress sufficiently formally and one regarding the staff ignoring problems in the rooms do not surprise me. The hotel is not focused on making guests comfortable. It is focused on creating the most luxurious and royal experience possible for people for whom expense is irrelevant. If you want to wear your designer silk suit and be served by waiters in white gloves then the Royal Mansour is the right place to stay. If you are looking for a place where you will feel a warm welcome and where luxury means truly personal service then Royal Mansour is not perfect for you. Just to give you a sense of the place every time we returned to the hotel on foot we were stopped at the gates by staff who politely inquired who we were (apparently you are not allowed on the property unless you are a guest). They didn't seem to get that we were guests at the hotel and I guess the fact that we were walking and not in a private car made them question whether we belonged there. They always seemed mildly surprised when we showed them our room key. In the end we enjoyed our stay but have some reservations.,Date of stay: November 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"atherton, ca",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happytraveler00

One had no hot water another not enough cold water. I slept in a basic room. First my door lock didn't work. Then I almost fell over door matt that curls up because it doesn't fit under door.  Crazy detail: no good shower. Just a small hand shower. Afraid to use it as an electric lamp hangs just above you if you stand in bath.  Got back to room at night to discover no light near door. Once inside a strong sewer smell coming from bathroom. Had to sleep with door shut and ventilation high. Bad night.  Wonder if designer ever tried his own hotel room.

While staying at Royal Mansour is a bit pricy the restaurant La Grande Table Marocaine is a must to celebrate a birthday or any special occasion. I had made the reservation directly by email and received an immediate response; when I inquired if a birthday desert could be created with included dates and figs I was informed that they would ""do our best to make this moment truly memorable and the first step in the Royal Mansour discovery.""    The hotel is amazing; the King brought all artists and artisans of Morocco and had them do what they do best.... magical. Definitely make time to tour the grounds.    The dining experience is amazing. White gloves on the staff. Music from a gentleman in the entrance hall; so the sounds are just far enough from the table so as to be enjoyable... you want to hear it. Subtle.    The service is an important part of the adventure... so be adventurous with the food. Pigeon pastille was amazing! We sampled The breads addictive.    The desert that was created included pastry and ice cream. My girlfriend loved it. Then there were cookies... which we asked to take with us. No problem; a cute little box was presented- but not for the cookies that were on the table... they brought new cookies!    Expensive. Yes. Worth the expense. Yes.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,TopTripie wrote a review Oct 2012,50,The Royal Mansour - a very Moroccan Experience.,You can’t help but be impressed - it’s a very slick operation.  Well hidden in sumptuous gardens it’s very discreet.  It’s approached through what almost looks like a back road that wouldn’t appear ( at first glance ) to particularly lead anywhere. It’s classic Moroccan style everywhere with an excellent staff to guest ratio. Obviously it’s at the top end of the price scale but the hotel always exceeded expectations. The Bloody Mary Cocktail came up exactly as ordered ( extra hot and spicy ) whilst the Lychee Martini was the perfectly cool foil.  Ideal to do business in - especially for “sotto voce” discreet meetings.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,dunn j wrote a review Jul 2012,10,a nightmare in Royal mansour,I am writing to share with you the unbelievably unthinkably out of the ordinary experience my family and I had at Royal Mansour “Palace” Marrakech.  We were staying at Palais Namaskar and we wanted to explore the best Marrakech has to offer. We were told Royal Mansour Palace with its restaurants will be the spot to hit. We were eight and were happy to celebrate my little daughter’s birthday in a place we wish we didn’t go to…  Once in Royal Mansour the entrance was like a dream; our breath was taken away by the beauty of the scene. We all agreed on having Royal Mansour as our hotel of choice for the next visit to Marrakech.  We were greeted with smiles and led to the restaurant where we were supposed to dine. We asked the head waiter if we can be sited outside we were informed that the terrace was booked although it seems that the hotel was completely empty hence the reason! But we were happy with a table inside. The sommelier helped us selected the wine.  Just when we thought we will be spending a night to remember (and it for sure will be) the head waiter came and asked us that we cannot dine there because of my shorts (that were not shorts they were pants way below my knees). I thought first that was a joke of some sort. But the man seemed to be embarrassed and proposed me a transfer to our hotel so I can change my pants.  My whole family and I were in a complete shock of what we went through. We travelled all the way to Marrakech and came here to be embarrassed in such an unimaginable way.  I never in my entire life wrote a letter of complaint about a bad service I received but this I had to vent my anger and I hope the proprietor of this magnificent palace is aware of what’s going on in his propriety.

We stayed in our own Riad - 3 stories high with a pool on the roof. The service was impeccable. Every need was anticipated and filled with gracious kindness. The concierge took care of our dinner reservations transportation shopping needs. The hotel keeps tight security and so we felt safe and insulated from the heat and madness of the streets. The food at the hotel was outstanding - even breakfast was served with gloved waiters. Most of the staff spoke English. I can not recommend this hotel highly enough.

Just worth it however (although some of the menu items are just a little unreasonable - a dish of couscous is £35 for example).    If you submit to the open wallet sugery that takes place it is just incredible. This place ""feels"" so special & the staff are so calm and organised.    The main draw is the hotel itself - it's genuinely exquisite. Sensationally glamourous and cool - it's unlike most very expensive hotels I've been too - there is an X-Factor to the place that is hard to describe.

Right from leaving the aircraft you will be met by 'Royal Mansour' reps taken into the VIP lounge...passports checked and no queing.  Bags were taken to the Range rover waiting for us 15 minutes drive to Palace then met by Management and showen to our Amazing Riad.  Room keys were given in leather wallets we were showen our Riad and how touch screen lighting/air con system works 3 floors of opulant furniture and little touches were making me feel like a Celebrity.  Fresh fruit and Morroccan sweets were in lounge on arrival bottled water supplied and Coffee machine with pods and tea. (microwave & fridge was available in mini kitchen area)  The bedroom was Beautiful with Gorgeous En-suite luxury products included..shampoo - hair mask - make up cleanser - exfoilating soap - body lotion plus more..luxury robes and slippers for use.  Menus were available in Riad for breakfast/lunch/tea/drinks and dinner... prices were more than expected but its a once in a lifetime treat.  There were 2 plasmas in Riad one downstairs in lounge and one in bedroom my husband loved the fact that you could pause the film your watching on one Tv and then continue watching on the other. ...various films free of charge in languages to suit.  On the top floor was the plunge pool 2 sunbeds and seating area... bliss in the sun.  The breakfast was included in our package ( it was 450 dirahams pp on menu )... served by white gloved butlers and a good selection.  Currency exchange was by Reception and had a good rate than the UK  We didnt see the spa but apparently it was amazing  The palace was walking distance to the Jemma square we went here in the day and night and both times were different its quite an experience.  We went on a tour of Marrakesh but the best they showed had no comparison to our Hotel I felt the tour should of showed our Hotel and it would be the Highlight.  We returned to the airport via a Luxury heated/massage seats Mercedes S Class and were taken care of with the Reps we did not que and our passports were checked VIP style...then taken to the VIP lounge for coffee/drinks  Amazing stay Thank you very much Royal Mansour.,Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Jersey, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Taurus_World

As soon as we touched down in Marrakech and before we had entered the airport building we were whisked away from the ""normal"" holidaymakers to the beginning of 2 days of heaven.We were taken past all the usual checks and escorted to a Mercedes Limousine where we were taken to the Royal Mansour Hotel.As we gently arrived through the huge entrance gates and up to the front of the hotel both our doors where opened at exactly the same time with great precision and then we were presented to the staff of the hotel. I found myself wondering if they had picked up the wrong people and were expecting royalty or someone like that. We were then shown to our Riad and words cannot describe what we saw as we walked through the door It was just incredible the attention to detailthe size of the Riad and not least the immaculatley presented staff are such an asset to this hotel. Three floors of Morrocan oppulence were shown to us as we walked from one exquisite room to another. We decided to eat in the Morrocan Resturant for our first evening meal as it was my wife's birthday we thought we would splash out a bit. The food was out of this world and the service was fantastic.As we climbed (and I mean climb) into bed I didnt want to sleep because I couldn't take all of this in -but sleep I did - so much in fact we were late for breakfast. But again nothing was too much trouble we were escorted to our table on the patio and were attended to like a king and queen.A tour of the hotel is a must just to see the work that has gone on to create this ""palace"" is breathtaking.For the second evening meal we chose to eat on our terrace under the starsonce again nothing was too much trouble and whilst we were playing with the huge internet tv our private butler was getting dinner ready. Dinner was fantastic and so we climbed into our huge bed and dreamt that we didnt have to go home. But home we had to go to and our leaving was as perfect as our arriving. After thanking the Manager and his staff for an absolute mind blowing 3 days and 2 nights we had to say goodbye and get back into the limo for the ride back to reality.

I enter through the gates into a decadent luxuriant palace.The Lobby is something out of 1001 Arabian Nights. I need a thesaurus to help me get close to describing what I am seeing and even then I will only fail .  ’  I get shown to my roomsorry my ‘Personal Riad’As I walk through the private courtyard with its pretty fountain past my welcoming area with a daybed strewn with beautiful cushions for awaiting guests  into my sitting roomI know that I am experiencing something special.  If only my words were as ornate and well crafted as my sitting room.I find it hard to convey the details of the wallswith inlaid Cedarwood panelling bordered by beautifully carved plasterwork(the plasterwork is all hand preparedit was laid flat and the an artisan created the intricate designs)then the golden silk panelling reaching up to the heights and more beautifully sculpted plasterwork that join a wooden ceiling full of colours and richness.Oh Lord I am crap….I cant’t do itmy words simply are not skilful or technical enough to explain the richness of this room. Even a photograph won’t do.No you have to get on a plane and come and visit Royal Mansourbut mind you bring that big fat chequebook.  Throughout the riadthere are marble floorsThe sitting room and guest waiting room have grey marble floorsThe stairways which lead to the sleeping quarters have inlaid marblethe bathrooms have a beautiful brown marblethey must have emptied a whole quarry somewhere in Italy !  The bedroom is warm it has wooden floors and wooden lattice work separating the dressing areathe doorway leading to the bathroom beats anything I saw in the antique shops.There is a very pretty dresser/ desk set into a window alcove with an ornate chair placed carefully in front.The bed is grand and wooden and there is a bench at the end upholstered in a rust coloured velvet.A Huge armchair is placed in the corner next to the brass mirror.The walls are adorned with more of the splendid wood panelling and handcrafted plasterwork.The piece de resistance is the ochre coloured wooden ceilings with handpainted beams with Moorish patternwork.I think it would be fair to say I love this room.  There is the obligatory oversized bath (also marble!) and a huge shower with you guessed it marble walls and pretty lantern lighting.There is a throne room fit for a prince very spacious with toilet and bidet and a beautiful patterned opaque glass door.  There is also a novel ideaa luggage roomto keep those ugly suitcases away from the beautiful dressing areas.  The light fittings also are special from the black candelabra in the sitting roomto the crystal chandelier in the hallwaythe beautiful silver and leaded lights in the bathroomthe pretty lanterns lighting up the stairwells and the copper star shaped light above my bed.  Then up another set of marble inlaid stairs I progress to the roof terrace where there is a rustic bright coloured daybed set in its own petit marquee with at its centre a pretty patterned wooden coffee table there are matching side tables .This will be a wonderful place to take a breakfast 4 tiled stairs lead to a small private heated plunge pool and 2 towel bedecked sunloungers next to an open fireplace.Home!!!!!!!!  On each floor is a mystery doorit leads to a secret set of passagewaysthat in turn lead to the kitchens and storage areas of the hotel.No member of staff appears at your front doorinstead the smartly dressed butlers arrive through these portals as if by magic.  My favourite part of the hotel however are the lighting and aircon controls.They are all electronicthey are easy to use and they actually work.Until today I have sworn that we will not use domotic engineering in our new hotel as it is far too complex you need a manual on how to use itand the blasted things malfunction half of the time.I find myself closing curtains when I wish to switch on the bathroom light.Not hereno no no…The Royal Mansour has got it right. Fantastic wall panels with touchscreen panels that even a technophobe can use. Yes that would be me!  I also love the keysan electronic card like normalbut presented in a beautiful leather wallet.It really gives the feel of sheer luxury.  Okay enough of the gushing room description and on to the stay.    Once I have cleared the tears of joy from my eyes on entering the riadI see a plethora of goodies waiting for me.Fantastic patisserieswonderful fruitsI will not need my lunchbut I might need a new pair of trousers to fit intoque gordo soy yo! I am shown the room service menusall 5 of themthey are beautifully presented on a stand.There are 1 each for BreakfastLunchAfternoon tea and Dinnerand there is also a Drinks menu to complete the set.As I head off to tour the hotelI am told they can unpack my bags….Prince Weingard thinks ‘why not !’.  I am shown the restaurants which are in a separate restaurant riad the 2 main restaurants are French and Moroccan.The consultant chef is Yannick Alleno Head Chef at Le Meurice.I ask which is the best place to eat.I am told the Moroccan restaurantwhen pressed a little further I am told the French restaurant is full.Moroccan it is then!To give you a brief insight into the French restaurant however I will list a few dishes and their (g)astronomical prices:  Langoustines crues assaisonees au caviar 1500 MAD (USD 170/EUR 135/GBP 110)  Faux Filet de Boeuf Wagyu Roti 1600 MAD (USD 180/EUR 140/GBP 115)  The Menu degustacion is however a well priced 2000 MAD ( USD 235/EUR 180/GBP 150)  I then take a tour through the Spa and view the indoor swimming pool. All of which are as opulent and splendorous as you would expect.  I head back to my room and pay a quick visit to the Kids club which to be honest seems small and disappointing in comparison to the rest of this grand abode. I go back to my room and start writing.  I shower with the beautiful soaps and shampoos and then dry off and change.My first real complaintthere is obviously a small problem with the drains and the bathroom is left with a nasty odour ( and no it isn’t Mark made).  LaterI decide to sample room service and order a glass of rose champagne with a little foie gras as an aperitif on my roof terracewhat else would Prince Weingard order .My first drink of the New Yearwhat the hellI may even drink some wine with my meal.  The Moroccan restaurant is beautiful but feels like dining in a library.There are people sitting at just one other table and there is no music.I order a mix of Moroccan salads followed by Turbot done 2  ways and then a Moroccan fruit based dessert.The wine list is exclusively French except for a few Moroccan wines.Yes I know I should go for the Moroccan winesbut I plump instead for a wine from Cotes de CatalanesI am getting homesick obviously.  As my first course is served the silence is broken by a wail of a man in obvious pain.Moroccan music is obviously not my cup of mint teahow I wish to be back in the library of 15 minutes ago.  The food is simply sublimethe service excellentI go to bed full to the brim.My room has had no turndown servicebut I could not really care or complain as I sink into the mattress and have one final look at my Moroccan masterpiece of a bedroom and royally sleep.    I awake the next day very earlyas there was no turndown service the curtains were wide open and I rise with the sun.I order breakfast and then run my bath .I am told my breakfast will take 30 minutesI have ordered everythingthere is a set price of 450 MAD (USD 53EUR 40GBP 34) .After 15 minutes my bath is hardly filledI hop in anyway and lie back and promptly smash my head on the hard marble edge of the tubsquare baths are not comfortable and especially half empty square baths.  I head upstairsmy aperitif from last night is still on the terracenot cleared away.I sit down and start writing and wait ….and wait… and wait.My breakfast takes 55 minutes to arrivebut I will say it was a breakfast fit for a prince a very fat prince leagues better than Amanjena.  I ring down and organize another little tour of the hotel.The lovely Khadija is there to meet me.She informs me that it took 4 years for 1000 craftsmen working 24 hours a day to build the Royal Mansour.The hotel is owned by the King of Morocco himself.She shows me around all of the public spacesThe bar is incredible with a marble ceiling and a beautiful bed of leaves sculpture covering the marble.The function room upstairs has a wall covered with a wallpaper made from silver and leather.But none of this is flashy or lacking tasteit is simply beautifulthis hotel is a modern day wonder.I could take you on a verbal tour of all of the spacesbut I wil simply run out of superlatives.    I ask for the butler to help me pack my bags he does it very wellmuch better than I could.I run around taking some last photographs and making last minute notes and then bid farewell to my room.    I pay my very high billwithout flinchingknowing that I have just had a fantastic stay in a wonderful place.The service is very formal and not warm like at Amanjena but it is a far better hotel in every other aspect.  Would I recommend The Royal Mansour? The answer is Yes and No.If you are going away for a weekend break to Marrakech with your loved one and want to splash outTHIS is the place.If on the other hand you want a family holidayforget it. I wouldn’t bring my kids as I would be scared stiff of them breaking something or just making noise.It is a little too formal for mebut then Royalty is about formality.A princely stay.,Date of stay: January 2012,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Island of Malta, Malta",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markwlugano
Royal Mansour Marrakech,ZioL B wrote a review Nov 2011,50,a real experience,"I stayed at the Royal Mansour last week  This is ""the experience"" in Marrakech. It is like living in a Medina. Everything till the very last detail is extremely accurate.  They have no rooms but only Riads i.e. a small house. I stayed in one on 3 floor with a courtyard living room one bedroom two bathrooms and a terrace with plounge pool.  Public areas are not as huge as you can expect but this is in line with the ""philosophy"" of the property.  It is like living in a museum with arabic handicraft and architecture spreaded everywhere.  The property is just 5 minutes walk from the centre but you really do not feel feel it because it is quiet and relaxing.    There is a magical atmosphere and I would strongly recommend this property if you are travelling with your companion.",Date of stay: November 2011,Trip type: Traveled solo,roma,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZioLB
Royal Mansour Marrakech,jcoyangu wrote a review Aug 2011,50,Simply Incredible,I stayed 2 nights in the Royal Mansour Hotel the last weekend of July 2011 and really I continue astonished. The riad is incredible about 180 sq. meters in 3 floors with a private pool and a terrace in the 3rd level. The decoration is very luxury and comfortable (you are as in your own house) and the service is always perfect. The restaurants are also at the same level of the hotel: La Table is perfect for the brakfast and casual lunchs and La Grande Table is one of the best restaurants in Marrakech.    If the day is too hot you can use the swimming pool with air conditioned that there is in the SPA building... perfect after a Marrakesh tour.    For me it have only two small problems: this is the most expensive hotel in Marrakech (minimum 1.000€ each riad per night) and it's too calm and relax (no noise no lot of people... only thought for your relax).,Date of stay: July 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Madrid, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcoyangu
Royal Mansour Marrakech,Atric wrote a review Aug 2011,50,Wow! But stay away if you are a penny-pincher.,This place is a palace - quite literally as it belongs to the king of Morocco. The very high standards of quiet elegance sophistication and unobtrusive yet attentive staff are very difficult to find almost anywhere in the world and rare indeed on the African continent.  Don't get me wrong. It is VERY expensive both for room rate and the cost of services but this is a deliberate ploy to make sure that it doesn't attract the 'wrong' sort of people and it succeeds - In spades!  If you can afford it I can highly recommend this place for a relaxing elegant and pampered stay close to the heart of Marrakech. If you want a standard 5 star hotel and are looking for a bargain I suggest you look elsewhere. You would be like a fish out of water in this place.,Date of stay: July 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Barnsley, UK",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Atric
Royal Mansour Marrakech,holsgal wrote a review Jul 2011,50,50th Birthday celebration,Stayed at this hotel 20th-24th July 2011 . The weather was kind to us only in the mid 30's instead of mid 40's! Wouldn't normally go at this time of year but can't change my birthday.The hotel is a selection of riads small 3 story houses that are so beautifully designed it takes a good day just to explore all that it has to offer. We had a one bedroomed riad and enjoyed a courtyrad a living room with tv bar etc  then upstarirs to a bedroom with beautifully appointed bathroom & full of luxury goodies .No need to take toiletries with you as they even provided face cleanse nail varnish remover hairbrush as well as all the usual stuff. Up another fligth of stairs & you come to your own private rooftop pool & sunbed area. It has a fire for the winter evenings which i think would be very romantic.The hotel was built to the Kigs specifications & on arrival you are treated like royalty as you are met practically att he aircraft steps & taken to the VIP lounge whilst the chap gets your passports checked & brings your luggage to you! Then a mercedes whisks you the 10 minutes drive to the airport.On arrival at the hotel you are then taken to your room amazingly your lugagge gets there before you! Every day we were given a plate of fresh fruits & a plate of dried fruits fresh roses were everywhere in amazing displays. The service in this hotel is refined discreet & elegant. Not too many people there when we stayed so we had the pool in the gardens to ourselves.  Although expensive it is an experience well worth trying even if just for one night.,Date of stay: July 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/holsgal

Headed by the same Michelin-starred chef of Le Maurice (Paris France) we'd great expectations about the degustation menu with wine pairing. Started feelings symptoms of food poisoning immediately after. Realize now why the hotel occupation was so low. Wrote a complaint to the customer service dept and got no reply...

Royal Mansour Marrakech,HelenaMi wrote a review May 2011,50,This hotel will give a taste of how it’s to be treated like royalty,I don’t think anyone can say something negative about this fantastic hotel especially if you know that this hotel was commissioned to be built by the King of Morocco Mohammed VI.  Without any doubt this is a number 1 hotel in Marrakesh. I’ve travelled a lot stayed in very good hotels but this one is really SOMETHING!!!!  The service is superb but it’s the design that takes the breath away. Rooms are very big each room has it’s one roof terrace with plung and pool.  There is also a huge spa two swimming pools and a hammam with hot mild and cold rooms created with combinations of light steam and water. There are also the usual beauty fitness and gym facilities.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,Reyad_Kesri wrote a review Feb 2011,50,The Most Refined Hotel In The World,"I travel often and have been in the most luxurious hotels especially in the Middle East.    Nowhere have I experienced a more exclusive service in such a wonderful facility. The ""hotel"" is located at a walking distance to Jamaa Al Fna the heart of Marrakech. I have used quote marks because this facility can't be described as a standard 5 stars hotel.    The facility is composed of 50 unique Riads 3 restaurants and SPA not from this world!!! Each of these Riad serviced by a private buttler is worth writing about (I have used 3 and visited 4). Once inside every detail of the architecture design layout fabrics furniture private swimming pool and so on ... contribute to a sensation of serinity.    The SPA located in the compound is perfect. The food was excellent. But I definitely recommend out dinning and explore Marrakech multitude of restaurants.    Last but not least what made the stay truly memorable was not the refinement of the materials or the luxury of the facility what made it truly memorable was the excellence of the service.    My thanks to : The buttlers Parvez Mario and Pico. Sarah of the kids club. Jerome Salah and Karim from the SPA the housekeepers the maintenance people and gardeners and of course ... Mr. Chaumard himself for his kind attention.

Royal Mansour Marrakech,cb12345MI wrote a review Nov 2010,50,"If you've got it, flaunt it.",Marrakech has it and the Royal Monsour shows it off beautifully. The Morrocan craftsmanship and detailing of the property are very impressive and tastefully done. If you have the resources stay in one of the raids. If not put on chic and have a drink in the bar which will enable you to see the public spaces.  Because the hotel is so new there are a few minor service glitches but nothing to prevent you from enjoying this oasis of calm in the wild ride which is Marrakech. The Royal Mansour will improve with age under the guidance of the manager Jean-Pierre who is concerned with the pleasure of the guests.  We enjoyed the services of the available cars and escorts which a hotel of this level should provide. The food in the onsite Moroccan restaurant was better then the one medina restaurant we tried for dinner. Room service food was so-so. The army of staff is well hidden which add to the atmosphere of calm.,Date of stay: November 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Michigan,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cb12345MI
Royal Mansour Marrakech,Richard D wrote a review Nov 2010,40,"Good, but a very long way from the best.",Not wishing to cover the same ground as previous reviews the architecture is certainly impressive. The attention to detail in the decor is second to none.  However posting this half way through a 6 day stay I really have to comment on some aspects that fall far short of the best hotels.  Arriving late the first night we ordered from the room service menu. Mistake. Filets of turbot turned out to be deep fried fish sticks (if you are serving goujons say so!) Preserved lemon chicken had been preserved far too long tough and tasteless.  Breakfast the following morning in the ''La Table'' restaurant was poorly presented (eg egg benedict was a single poached egg atop a 50cm diameter toast with a thin layer of turkey. No garnish just a sorry looking egg on toast.)  However this was exceeded on our second evening.  We had reserved a table in the French restaurant. After drinks in the bar we went to the restaurant which was closed! On enquiry we were told that since they had just the one booking they decided not to open. Well the one booking was us and nobody bothered to inform us. As a hotel positioned where it is restaurants are a service not a whim. You open and if nobody comes cést la vie. I can honestly say that I have never heard of any hotel anywhere at any price let alone 2000 euros a night that would take such action. Imagine turning up to the Mandarin in Hong Kong and being told Pierre was closed as they had few reservations. Hotels simply do not do this.  Finally I guess a cultural issue. Almost everywhere we visit now is non-smoking and it was particularly intrusive having to sit in the bar with cigars and cigarettes contaminating the air. Even talking to the concierge yesterday a corpulent gentleman with an equally corpulent cigar felt it was simply not necessary for him to consider others. My wife and I left before completing our discussions such was the choking smoke. By all means cater to smokers but those of us who find it revolting should also be considered. No such luck at this hotel.  So would I recommend the hotel? Difficult call. The place itself is impressive but at their present state of development you may be staying in a palace but do not expect royal treatment. This will undoubtedly change and improve in future but when?,Date of stay: November 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Hong Kong,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richarddC2382ZW
Royal Mansour Marrakech,Tm_06 wrote a review Oct 2010,50,The most luxurious hotel on the African continent and maybe abroad,"We are used to stay in the world's most luxurious properties and we have never been impressed more than any other hotel so far. From very first second you feel that you are guest in one of the most fantastic hotels of the world. First class transfer to the hotel (they have pristine S600 V12 cars) check in experience public areas are just the combination of traditional finest zeliges and craftwork of the country mixed with the most tasteful and elegant touches of decoration (baccara lalique ...etc). Then when it comes to your private Riad we had the first category and it was just HUGE and so so so ELEGANT ! Passing your door you enter a nice patio with fountain and seating area on ground floor we had one morrocan salon plus two european style salons. On the first floor (which is basically already a second floor since the ceiling is 6 meters high on the ground floor :) ) a dressing room for ""Monsieur"" a very large room with a dressing room for ""Madame"" (wood sculptures are exceptional as a separation with the bed zone) wide bathroom with still tumost refinement and taste in the choice of materials and amenities. Then you can go on the second floor with a spectacular terrace (morrocan salon nice water bassin fireplace and sunbeds). You feel very ""special"" and privileged by staying there. The 3000 sq.meters spa is impressive the ""white cage"" concept decoration in the main lobby of the spa is breathtaking indoor swimming pool is just a rare quality and size treatment rooms are extremely large and boast the very last technology. Absolutely nothing is missing. Just perfect. Three restaurants (international French and Morrocan) with the finest cuisine you could ever dream of. The bar and cigar lounge are as well above any expectations. Location of the hotel is unique right in the heart of the Medina of Marrakech. Staff is very well trained and even when we were there the hotel was in pre-opening we could immediately understand that the staff was coming form the world's finest properties. Utmost service. By the way your Riad has a buttler and service doors on each floors so you never see them going through the door ! So SMART ! Top technology (climate control with touch screens sonorization etc - you can be in the Morrocan mood music they have a very large selection of music)  More than recommended you will definitely pass something in your life if you do not stay at the Royal Mansour Marrakech no more.",Date of stay: July 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,France,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tm_06

Royal Mansour Marrakech,Abdellah E wrote a review Jul 2010,50,Heavenly!,"I've stayed in numerous hotels in my life but for the first time I fall short of words to describe the experience we just had at Royal Mansour Marrakech. I am literally speechless!!! Words like Sublime Awesome Marvellous etc...simply don't do it justice. I will then stick to my 9 year old son's verdict: he said ""Dad I remember you saying that when we die we go to a place between earth and heaven. Could this be it?""    I can safely describe this as the most beautiful hotel in the world! Architecturally it's the embodiment of millennia of the finest Moroccan craftsmanship. Intricate mosaic work on walls floors and courtyard water fountains; artfully painted and carved wooden and gypsium ceilings plus what's probably the world's largest collection of paintings by all-Morrocan artists; are all a feast for the eyes and senses.    We ate at the Table Française where its 3 star chef (whose name I can't recall) treated us to French gastronomy at its best. The service be it in the restaurant or in the Riad (where you get your own personal butler) is reverential yet unobtrusive.    Expensive? Yes but definitely worth the expense for special occasions.
