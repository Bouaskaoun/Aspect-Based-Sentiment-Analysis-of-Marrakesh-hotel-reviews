Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Catherine B wrote a review Mar 17,50,"Glamorous, friendly, and kid-friendly too!","My husband had a conference at the Lounge & Spa and wanted to bring our whole family. Since we have 4 kids (ages 5-13) the only room type that could accommodate such a large family was a suite in the Palais Imperial. My husband was hesitant because the photos on the website made the decor look a little dated but the halls are beautiful and our suite is clean new and very elegant.  Everything in the hotel is so fancy I was worried that children would be less than welcome but the entire staff is kind solicitous and so warm towards our kids. The Kids Suite was tricky to find at first but the front desk gave us good directions. It's not as high-energy as some other resort kids' clubs we've been to but after days of strenuous traveling it was a welcome break. One thing we didn't realize was that it's included in the room rate! The kids went for a couple of hours for a change of pace; they colored learned to write their names in Arabic made crafts played games and had a good time.  Everyone on staff speaks good French & English though sometimes it took a little bit of explaining for some of the waitstaff to understand my 10-year-old's celiac needs. We had the easiest time navigating gluten at the buffet breakfast at Le Jardin each day; there was a whole shelf of GF bread & pastries--both French & Moroccan--and when we asked for separate Nutella to avoid cross-contamination they understood immediately and brought generous portions to our table. Restaurants & Room Service have ""Prince & Princess"" menus of familiar foods in smaller portions and I was very surprised at how quick Room Service was. They brought us macarons every day & there were Moroccan pastries & fresh fruit waiting for us in our room at check-in.  The whole hotel smells of orange blossoms spices & bergamot there are bitter orange trees and bougainvillea all over the property the pools are beautiful (only one is heated) and the whole place is kept meticulously clean. Room cleaning and turn-down service was always thorough and quick.  In short it's been one of the most unique and comfortable hotel experiences we've ever had.",Date of stay: March 2023,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catherinebN6555QB

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,andyh67186334 wrote a review Jan 2023,50,Five Night Stay at the Palais Imperial,I stayed for 5 nights at the Palais Imperial and from the moment I checked in until the moment I Checked out my stay was very special indeed.  My accommodation was a Luxury Room with garden and pool view. The room was comfortable a good size and kept very clean. The public spaces such as the lobby were very luxurious and welcoming. There were plenty of spaces to sit both inside and outside with an extensive outdoor pool complex.  Breakfast was of a high quality with plenty of food and drink choices in a buffet style arrangement.  There were other restaurants within the hotel but I did not try them as smoking is permitted which is a common trend in Morocco which needs to be addressed.  The biggest asset of the hotel was the staff. They were so welcoming and friendly and most addressed me by name as I always made an effort to interact with them.  The hotel's location is convenient for all of the major attractions and I walked everywhere.  I thoroughly recommend staying at this hotel.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Coalville, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andyh67186334

The lighting at night is very poor. When we asked to be moved the answer was no. We then asked to speak to the General manager or even a duty manager who failed to get back to us despite several requests through guest relations. Very poor customer service .

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,dadio77 wrote a review Apr 2022,30,A relaxing stay in a busy city!,This was a nice resort rooms were clean apart from a problem with a drain smell in the shower that despite being reported never really went away - staff were generally helpful breakfasts were just OK though it's fair to highlight Sofitel is a French chain and caters more for the continental palate! We adapted quite quickly.    The pool area is excellent for some reason only one of the pools is heated though and as many others have mentioned there is an extortionate charge to use the indoor pool!    Lunch and Room Service was very hit and miss - for not far off European pricing most meals were very average at best.    Location-wise many places were either a walk or a few minutes taxi ride away so very convenient but outside the city walls so more relaxed.    Finally the room we were staying in looked nothing like the pictures on the website so although we booked 'Palais' I think we were in the 'Lounge' and Palais seemed to be closed - bit naughty really but not the end of the world - there were however some very irate guests complaining about the wrong room allocation as we were leaving so not everyone was as accepting!    This was our first visit to Marrakech and if we were to return I would stay for a shorter time but splash out on La Mamounia which we visited for lunch and was spectacular.,Date of stay: April 2022,,"Bromsgrove, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dadio77
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,AUDREY F wrote a review Apr 2022,50,5 star hotel bedroom,Beautiful refurbished Sofitel Palais imperial. The prestige suite has 2 bedroom and 2 sinks and 2 toilets. The finish has been done amazingly. The service is so good we got plenty water in the room too daily.  Everything is brand new even the windows. The rooms are very quiet and the balcony with the Atlas view is breathtaking.    We will definitely go back . We usually stay in the lounge and spa but since it was refurbished we decided to stay in the side of Palais imperial.    Both restaurant are so beautiful and have been refurbished too and the breakfast is the best . Allways a good service from Rachida my favorite and all their colleagues Bachkar Said Ilhan Ibrahim Farah Abderachim and Hicham. They a good team and look well after us at breakfast and help my son get his breakfast as we usually there in the last 5 min as we get up so late.    The oasis restaurant even made us some orange ice cream for the week as my son is allergic to lemon and strawberry sorbet so we were pleased thanks to the p√¢tissier too for making it even if we did not see him much this year. Because of Ramadan they did not have the pancake station and the ice cream station.    Thanks for the snack bar as well to prepare us a crudite salat that was not on the menu.    The only think that could do with improving are the beds . Some had ice cream on them and were not cleaned up afterwards the food is left out for hours by the pool there they could tidy up a bit sooner. And the waiter don‚Äôt go round to ask guests for drinks  it‚Äôs up to the guest to call a waiter or order at the bar. Maybe because they were understaffed or because it was Ramadan.    We will definitely go back another thing are the taxi fare because you stay at Sofitel it‚Äôs more expensive. They just seem to charge the same prices as England or France.

We should not have worried. This hotel is fantastic. We were given a great newly decorated suite which was serviced by the astonishing Wifi (I hope we have her name correct). Her cleaning was spotless and she always welcoming and friendly despite the mess we made. The conceige and front desk team were also amazing. Zak Reda and Adil stand out. For example our packing failed given our local purchases but immediately the team sent out for a local bag for just a few dirhams so that we could pack successfully. They also arranged for a local guide Adane for trips around the city and into the Atlas mountains. He was just perfect for us. He was great company with fantastic local knowledge and (importantly) a great sense of humour. The gardens and pool areas were also very well laid out with ample room for ""proper swimming"" and great mature palm trees everywhere. After swimming the staff at the Palace Darkhum were always welcoming and hospitable. If this all sounds too superlative this is just what we felt! The proximity of the Medina was a further bonus and we could stroll in for a meal. One weakness we did feel was the room sevice menu was unimpressive given the other standards of the hotel and was too expensive for what you got. However would overwhelmingly recommend this great hotel and certainly stay here again. Thank you again to all the fantastic staff who are certainly the hotel's greatest asset1",Date of stay: April 2022,,"Folkestone, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nomad790285

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,justineb417 wrote a review Feb 2022,10,"Dirty , tired , unhelpful staff and way overpriced",I would like to make a complaint and am totally dissatisfied with my stay at the Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial.  We booked and paid for Luxury Rooms  After emailing to say we would like to check in at 3pm we arrived at the hotel at 3.30pm to be told our rooms were not ready and to come back in half an hour. We did this and was told again sorry it will be another half an hour until our rooms were ready and the hotel was very busy. The hotel did not seem busy at all?  We had been up since 2am and were so tired. We were pointed to the other side of the hotel and not taken to our rooms. Once we caught up on sleep and showered we realised the room was not luxury. There was a pile of cut pubic hair left of the ledge in the shower. The shower glass curtain did not contain the water and floor was flooded wetting all the towels. There are only 4 coat hangers in the wardrobe and you are only given 3 coffee sachets for 2 people. Trying to get more coffee was impossible. The carpet was coming away from seam and there was all white cream/powder around the door handles. The tiny balcony was so small you had to take turns to sit down on the chairs to both fit in to sit down. I phoned reception for 30 minutes before giving up. My daughter called them from her mobile and again no answer. If there was any emergency we would have not had any help at all. After complaining to reception they said they were dealing with an incident at that 1 hour we were trying to ring them. The next morning we got moved to then main nicer side of the hotel in a better room and given a bottle of bubbly ( we left it in the room as we do not drink alcohol) and some chocolates to apologise but again in the morning on closer inspection the same again. Only 4 coat hangers for 2 people staying a week. The tissue box cover was covered in thick dust. The telephone so was sticky and filthy I had to take a picture. The carpet had so many stains on so to sit down next to the mirrored wardrobe to apply make-up we had to put a clean towel down on the floor. This is totally not luxury or 5 star .  Also having chose a spa hotel we wanted to book some treatments. However on trying to contact the Spa reception you can never get anyone to answer the phone so I went down to book treatments. The spa opens at midday. So midday I went down to the spa and was met by the PT gym man and he said they don‚Äôt open until 12.15pm so I said I would wait. I wanted to wait by the main water feature but he didn‚Äôt want me to sit there for some reason. He also said do not go in the pool as it costs 500MAD I said I was a guest at the hotel and he said yes I know the indoor pool is not free!! When the spa receptionist arrived she informed me there were not free appointments today and tomorrow only 1 appointment left at 4.30pm. which I couldn‚Äôt make. No apology or anything. To say this is a 5-star hotel is a lie. I have stayed in cleaner Premier inn rooms. We paid a lot of money for a much-needed break and we were totally disappointed and feel as though we have been totally conned and overpaid for a basic unclean and dirty room.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Ganzmanica wrote a review Feb 2020,10,Total disappointment,We booked this hotel almost 8 months in advance l only to arrive here and wait for hours in order to check in.  Don‚Äôt let yourself foooed by the beautiful pictures and reviews. Most of the things you see in the pictures are very deceiving.  First of all the service is very slow. You ask the waiter for tea he‚Äôll tell to another waiter and the other waiter will tell you another one and so far and with everything else. By the time you get your tea or whatever service you need you might as well just go and make it yourself.  Second the hot water in the shower is barely dripping. No pressure at all. Guess what this is my third day at this hotel we complained numerous times talked to the manager of the manager‚Äôs manager (at least 3 managers two of them called Hanna and Imam). All we got was: ‚ÄúQui madam‚Äù... and nothing else. Nothing was fixed.  Third first night after trying to somehow to shower myself waiting for the hot water to make it to our focet I realized there‚Äôs no hair dryer in the room. Called the reception and they sent us a hair dryer. When I plugged it in the shower socket it wasn‚Äôt working. Called the reception once they said as always: ‚ÄúQui madam‚Äù. Waited for an hour nobody came. Called again the same story. For 2days in a row I called several times went to reception talked to 2 managers and until this day I cannot dry my hair. I had to dry my hair in the dark hall of the room on the floor since that was the only mirror and working socket in the room. At all my complaints calls requests the management did absolutely NOTHING. They finally sent a guy to check out the socket. And here‚Äôs another interesting development. It seems the Sofitel Marakesh hotel showers are not exactly for women‚Äôs needs. The socket is the shower is only for men‚Äôs beard shaving machines use. NOT FOR HAIR DRYERS. Now the funny part when I asked where I‚Äôm supposed to dry my hair I was told to go somewhere else. And use any other socket in the room. Once again there‚Äôs only one mirror in the room in the hall which is very dark even with the lights on and small. This is outrageous!! I have never seen or heard anything like this before.  Fourth the hotel has a beautiful pool which is not heated. In fact the water it‚Äôs so freezing that nobody is getting into the pool. The pool is always empty. They do have a smaller heated pool for $50 a day per person.  The bar and restaurant prices are ridiculously expensive. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. Don‚Äôt waste your time and money this hotel‚Äôs not worth it.  There‚Äôs a construction going on in the building so prepare yourself for the noise and the dirt around.,Date of stay: February 2020,,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ganzmanica

Check in took well over 30 mins once they were ready for us and although some staff pleasant (but incompetent) others quite rude.

But I was there for the Marrakech marathon which means I needed an early night. Yet I got a call at 10 pm fully 5 hours after checkin after having left a deposit asking me to come back to the reception to re-make a deposit with the card I'd used to make the booking.    Worse: I got a call from someone in Room Service at 1 am (!!!) asking if I'd called and needed something. Who does that???    Finally: if you're next door to a night club invest in double-glazing or soundproof your rooms. Because the noise was just scandalous.    Voil√† all these requests can be verified by hotel management to ensure they are not held in bad faith.

The hotel would be fabulous if they sort the breakfast. Situated in the bar which turns into a make shift breakfast in the morning. I like to browse and find my own breakfast in the morning. Very disappointed with layout. No reason why a omelette bar or some form of hot food bat cannot be set up. My omelette was cold and burned. Butter situated far from bar. Staff are very attentive but the whole stay was destroyed by the breakfast. For ¬£238 I expected a lot better breakfast and this was not a 5 star experience,Date of stay: January 2020,,"Belfast, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/louiseokane
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Kathy S wrote a review Jan 2020,50,Lovely stay at Sofitel Marrakech,We stayed here for a week last October. This was our second time staying here. Pool area is amazing fabulous sun mattresses. The pools were not heated unfortunately but one of them did seem to get warmer halfway through the week when we mentioned it. Breakfast had lots of choice and good quality but the service was a little chaotic at times despite lots of staff around. The breakfast chefs were very jolly. Hotel was very clean and the gardens well kept. We stayed in a suite with a lovely view. Walking distance to the medina but we did take petit taxis if we went to restaurants in the evening. We really enjoyed going to a couple of rooftop bars in hotels nearby. We really must mention Mokhtar one of the poolside waiters. What a lovely man so helpfulfriendly and polite. We really missed him when he had a day off. Some small issues with the bill when we checked out but it was sorted out to our satisfaction . All in all a lovely stay we would definitely come back.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Uxbridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lyingunderapalmtree
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Zineb K wrote a review Jan 2020,10,Worst exp√©rience ever in a sofitel,We are actually out to marrakech for a relaxing weekend . We choose sofitel to be sure about the quality and cleaness as we use to get to this hotel branch all over the world . However big surprise in the reception the table was dirty with cigarette Durst . We said it may happen . But the worst ever was the outdated room . It is 7am I am up because of a horrible mattress and my back is all hurting . I can not even understand how they get the 5 start not providing the basic which is a comfortable night sleep. They turned out weekend for a nightmare . As we wanted just to relax and stay for the whole weekend in a good hotel and now we have to change it with all the movement and stress around .    The food was great  the people in the reception welcoming . But the room far from cory not comfy.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,pugmom61 wrote a review Nov 2019,40,Mixed Feelings - but generally a very good hotel.,I have very mixed feelings about my stay at the Sofitel Palais. It is a beautiful property within walking distance to many great restaurants and clubs. The rooms were beautiful - but there is an odor that is quite noticeable when you first open the door to your room. Housekeeping is good but not great. My room was not vacuumed for the week I was there (I know because the same piece of tissue was there the entire time). The carpets definitely need cleaning or replacement. The wait staff at breakfast was very inattentive as were the waiters at the outside bar. In general expect slow service. We did thoroughly enjoy the So Spa. Katia the manager was very gracious and made us feel welcome and well cared for. I had the best facial and massages with Jalila. She is a true treasure. Her hands are magic and her smile would brighten any room. Also worth acknowledging was the Head Concierge - Reda Benjaroub who took care of all or our reservations (listen to him he knows his restaurants) as well as arranging a private full day excursion with an experienced guide and driver.,Date of stay: November 2019,,"Croton on Hudson, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pugmom61
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,SharonHarv wrote a review Nov 2019,40,Amazing Refurb of the Palais Rooms,We were travelling as a group of 4 female friends for a long weekend sunshine and relaxation. Well here we found it. We were very lucky to be the first guests to use the newly refurbished rooms in the Palais part of the hotel (imagine being the first person to sleep in the hotel bed :-) . The new rooms are AMAZING the service from Housekeeping & Room Service were top notch 5 star all the way. The check In procedure was awesome lovely cold towels fruit Tea & Moroccan Pastries.  The only areas that need improving are the food offerings for lunch as it is quite limited and not really good quality for the ¬£¬£¬£. Breakfast was also a bit hit and miss with Cold Coffee & Milk being brought to the table on various occasion's. If they can just get the F&B a bit better then the whole place would be 5 stars from us.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Whitney wrote a review Nov 2019,30,Mediocre,This hotel was a five-star property maybe 15 years ago--it should no longer have this rating. The entire property is in dire need of an update. Our room which was a suite was very basic and outfitted with dated decor. I can see how this place would have been viewed as top-of-the-line in 2000 but not 2019. The beds were very uncomfortable--stiff/hard mattress that ranks among the worst I've ever slept on at a hotel.    Overall the employees were not friendly or helpful. They seemingly did the bare minimum. When we arrived at the counter to check in the man behind the desk did not look up or greet us immediately and when he did acknowledge us he said ‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôll check you in since it‚Äôs my job.‚Äù My friend went up to the desk on our second day there to inquire about a restaurant and the clerk just looked at her and said ‚Äúthe concierge desk is over there‚Äù and pointed her to the other side of the lobby.    The one shining memory of our stay at this property was the lovely gentleman Hakim who is in charge of tea service. While we were waiting to check in Hakim brought my friend and I tea. He was such a friendly and warm individual talking to us about our journey and telling us a bit about himself. He invited us to come by later so he could make us his specialty tea with saffron. We went to see him later and as promised he made us amazing saffron tea. Hakim is a real gem; whenever we saw him in the hotel he greeted us by name and always offered to go out of his way to help us. I hope the management realizes how wonderful he is.    Additionally we did have an issue with the room while we were there and the manager (I forget her name) was very helpful in her efforts to rectify the situation. However it‚Äôs an unfortunate commentary that the two instances of good service stand out so much because the rest of the time we had sub-par experiences. If you‚Äôre at a ‚Äúfive-star‚Äù property every interaction with staff should be exceptional.    Overall not a place I would recommend. It‚Äôs not terrible but the value is poor and the only positive is the location. You should definitely be getting more for your money. If it fits in your budget stay at The Selman. We stayed there the first half of our time in Morocco and it was a true five-star property with amazing service.,Date of stay: October 2019,,"Boston, Massachusetts",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Whit387

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,keeeseee wrote a review Sep 2019,40,Great Property 4.9 stars,Location    The property is in the hotel zone which is a little walk from the main attractions in the City. However; hiring a taxi is easy and the price is pretty cheap when you convert. You can pay anywhere between 20 and 30 Dirham which is about $2.00-$4.00 US depending on how willing you are to negotiate. I pretty much saw all I wanted to see. Bahia and Badia Palaces the famous square and the medina and the different gardens. We pretty much got around by footing it.    Service  Excellent service the staff is well trained courteous and professional. I must mention the concierge who helped me to map out the city and the different attractions I wanted to see.    Rooms and Infrastructure  I really loved the suite we booked. It was quite big and offered great views of the facilities and the surrounding areas. Of all the hotels that we stay during our vacation they had the only bathroom where shower did not leak. I guess this is because they had tubs. They toiletries were also top notch too. The only problem I had with my room was the separated toilet and bidet that had no vanity for washing hands. I guess they expect the guest to wash their hands in the bidet.    The facilities were great. Please take some time to enjoy them during your stay. My two year old loved running through the little pools and there were so many tents and nooks to lounge and relax in.,Date of stay: September 2019,,New Jersey,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keeeseee
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,MyriahL wrote a review Sep 2019,50,"Gorgeous property, good walkability - food and bev prices crazy!",This is a gorgeous property in Marrakech complete with luxe amenities and beautiful rooms and facilities. The pool is wonderful and breakfast had countless delicious options. Rooms and beds were very very comfy and everything was immaculately clean.    The downsides were that the staff was a little surly on more than one occasion - we needed some help with train tickets etc and even though no one was at the counter no one at reception would help us and sent us to wait in line for the concierge. This was the same on the phone - the concierge never picked up but the reception staff wouldn't help us.    The top downside is the price of food and drinks beyond breakfast - alcoholic drinks especially were atrociously priced and the food was not good value for money (and did not have many local choices mostly Western food options).

The old city is at a walking distance where you can plan all your touristic and shopping activities.  The check in and out speeds are efficient. We came early for the check in and had to wait a little for the room to be ready while enjoying a welcome drink.  The room is big clean and cozy. All local touches were supported with a dark ambience. The sleeping comfort was excellent. The room has a balcony facing the fool or the city depending on your reservation.  The restaurant is amazing with all kinds of tastes for the breakfast.  The only disturbing point was the sound of a local music which is playing 16hrs a day I believe all around the hotel which is hearable from the room during midnight and also early in the morning.  There are 3 pools serving the guests. The colour selection of the poolside stuff are motivating you for a stay.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,tdillsav2016 wrote a review May 2019,50,Perfect location and friendly people!,Stayed here for 6 nights and the Palais is beautiful! The view from the room was beautiful we had a balcony with flowers outlining our view of the pool. While sitting on the balcony we saw the smallest hummingbird I have ever seen visiting the flowers. The location is perfect. Within walking distance to the souks a grocery store and mall and lots of restaurants. The people at the front desk were great! Always answered our questions with a smile. I would highly recommend this hotel. One of the pools is heated although the other pool was not and was too cold to use. One is all we needed.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Deborah D wrote a review May 2019,40,Great hotel,We arrived in the evening so the entrance looked amazing all lit up in pink. The lobby had amazing decoration and the pool area with all the lamps looked amazing. Our room was in the more modern side. The 4th floor a garden and atlas mountain view very quiet with a balcony. The room was spacious clean and had everything you needed but for me it lacked any morrocan charm at all it was decorated just like any other modern hotel very beige and boring which was a shame and a little dissapointing. I would have prefered the older rooms which are decorated more traditional. But this was a friends pick so we stayed in this side of the hotel. All the staff were very welcoming and helpfull and we really enjoyed our mint tea in the lobby chatting to the staff helping us with helpful phrases. The pool area is designed really well and looks amazing with lots of different areas. We enjoyed all the food on offer we are vegetarian but had enough of a selection at breakfast we had the evening buffet with the band on another night and enjoyed the poolside restaurant where the chef adapted the menu to us. We had only one issue the lift the button was broken an open hole with wires showing and the doors did not sense a person and did not stop closing this was reported but never repaired during our 4 night stay. The hotel is in a great location just 10 minutes in a taxi to the heart of the medinas. Or take an evening carriage ride tour around the old city not so hot or busy in the evening. Overall we really enjoyed our stay. A note to folks the lobby's are full of fresh roses which look beautifull but if like me you don't like flowers or strong smells it was a bit over powering and I could not stay inside long as it made me sneeze. Overall I would recommend this hotel.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G4468EIdeborahd

We had to make a downpayment for one night and they were going to clarify it the next day. Reception did not get back to us the next day we went twice to the front desk and I even spoke with reservations and she insisted our reservation had been cancelled . I went later again and said they had found the voucher. I went then to the front office manageress and told her how upset I was..... and she was rude and didn‚Äôt even apologize. Another occasion was that we came back to the hotel after a long day and our room wasn‚Äôt ready. I rang the reception and was told that someone would come to clean the room 15 minutes later I rang again as no one had come and she very arrogantly told me to call housekeeping myself!

The general rooms are quite small and darkalthough adequate.    The service is appalling - 30 minutes to get a diet Coke at the pool bar- seriously.    Only food available in the evening is either room service of the fine dining restaurant which is to be fair not very fine. My food was cold and tasteless.    Worst of allI had two items of clothing go missing frrom my bedroom. While I spoke to the duty manager at the time who promised a full investigation I have still not heard a word from the hotel (3 weeks now) despite contacting them by email and telephone.

The grounds around the pool were extensive and while it was to cold to  swim it was a great place for a pre- dinner drink.  Our room was older style but had a wonderful view of the mountains in the distance. Worth requesting.    My sister had a modern renovated room which lacked the ambience of old style  Morocco but was very nice anyway.    We thought paying 200 Duran to use the inside heated pool was expensive but nice to swim in. Tea was offered as part of the fee.    I thought the service for breakfast was great and I could see senior staff constantly being in the look out for issues.

Cheap....er no!,Travelled in March with excellent weather at 30c and glorious sunshine!!    Location; Doesn't get much better walking distance to jemaa el fna square and lots of good other restaurants/bars etc. The local supermarket is close by also which is useful for avoiding the high cost of basics in the hotel!    Accommodation wow book 487 if you can! And thank you sofitel for putting us in it! Stunning city view and more balcony than you can shake a stick at! Bit noisy but come on you miserable lot that have previously complained you are in the heart of the city!!    Pool area simply stunning and luxurious! All manner of different lounging options including day beds loungers and seating etc....all with matching provided towels...so no need to bring you own!    Negatives; Bit of a faff at check in. Coffee in room? Two measly sachets not replenished the next day what is it with Marrakesh? The last hotel we stayed here didn't even have a kettle so at least the Sofitel is ahead. But guys it costs peanuts to replace each day I found myself roaming the hotel looking for a maid or even a trolley that I could take from when no one was looking. And I had to order a small jug of milk from room service.    The cost of a beer was high...about ¬£8. This may have explained why the bars were empty? It was odd the pool being busy breakfast rammed and the bar at night like a zombie wasteland?? Charge less and get more punters in me thinks?? And the restaurants...where are they no clear directions map provided and unlike breakfast you cannot follow the herd?!    Staff very good in our humble opinion. However I do need to highlight one issue on the day we arrived whilst waiting by the pool we ordered two cokes as we did not have a room number we paid cash we paid with a 200 dirham note (¬£16) and the chap despite me explaining I wanted change didn't come back. He spoke excellent English there is no excuse it's theft. Which is a shame because the rest of the staff we encountered were really hard working and friendly. If sofitel which to contact me about this please do so you should find this employee and fire him.    Positives; Beds so comfy we have missed it! Speed of room service wow never had such quick service! And we were at the far end of the hotel just brilliant...thank you. Location great. Pools and sun beds exceptional. Free wifi (good speed). All common areas have a feel of elegance especially the foyer. Breakfast good.    Summary; Brilliant hotel in a cracking location. Other than above the staff are to be commended.

Also one of the restaurants had jazz music nightly. Very close to the square and the souks about a 3 minute car ride for $3 US. Also plenty of restaurants near the resort. There is also a casino about 100 yards from the entrance. This is a nice hotel and the common areas are great. However the room we were in was dark and in desperate need of an upgrade. The room also had a musky scent to it and a lack of outlets. The bed had a huge lump in the middle and you had to use your cell phone to see anything in the room. Also didn‚Äôt like the fact that you had to pay $40/pp to use the heated infinity pool. The common areas  of the resort make up for the room but a hotel of this caliber should have better rooms in my opinion.

You must run around or beg for them...    2.We always try to hang ''Do not disturb'' on our door as service always making their own order and afterwards we must to do big job to return order to way we need.    Why to place back 6 pillows on my bed and red stripe  if I am using and kept just two?  3.Why to place 7 pillows on my sofa which I must put down on the floor as with them sofa is out of use?  4.Why to cover all curtains which I must open when coming back?

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Caroline B wrote a review Mar 2019,40,Much needed tranquility,"Stayed here in February on a 5 night break to Marrakech. Welcome and check in was excellent and the mint tea and cold towels were a lovely touch.    Pool and sun loungers were a perfect area to relax and not too busy. I had a treatment in the spa which was very relaxing and the service offered was excellent.    We had a lovely meal in the upstairs restaurant on one evening which was the set Moroccan meal and was delicious although expensive.    In the evenings fire pits were lit on the terrace where you could have drinks which offered some welcome heat from the cool evenings. Cocktails were fantastic albeit a little pricey.    Breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice.    Staff were friendly particularly the door staff. Geographically it is very well located and within a 15 minute walk from the main square.    Downside was that our original room we were given (room 193) was extremely noisy from the street noise as it was located above the taxi rank and from about 11:30pm onwards we got no sleep. We complained on the first morning but were told that ""that was the room we booked"". We didn't make too much of a fuss but the following evening was unbearable (to the point where we both put tissue in our ears to try to block out the noise) and we got no sleep due to the outside noise. We complained again the next day (especially as we had specifically requested a quiet room) and after some back and forth were eventually told that we would be moved to an alternative room. Once we moved we had a lovely quiet and relaxing stay at the hotel.",Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hertfordshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E8863LDcarolineb

Pool area at hotel superb in all respects food excellent with drink (including all types of alcohol) prices very high when compared to UK prices carefour supermarket with alcohol section in basement 10 min walk away. Go for room with pool and atlas mountain view on a high floor. Rooms very nice but lighting could be a bit brighter for reading/dressing. Currency exchange at reception a very competitive rate with zero hassle take GBP and exchange as required dependent on daily needs. You need to be patient at airport escpecually getting through security on departure so allow pleanty of time. Can only use dirhams at airport for local items and shops will accept part dirham part GBP/Euro payment. Tobacco great deal at 22 to 25 euro per 200 depending on how many you buy much cheaper than on aircraft.  Great time go for it and enjoy.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Cornwall, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/harryhorsey

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Samir A wrote a review Feb 2019,10,Very rude front desk / Staff! NOT Recommended!,Don‚Äôt expect much from this hotel regarding service. Checked in 5 rooms in the morning and had 2 guests to join us later on because their flight arrived later on and they suddenly refused to check them in and refused to listen.    Being a Accor Platinum Member I have never seen such a low standard for a 5 star hotel. The First surprise was that they are not able to retrieve your status because their system is not capable to do so. I have travelled a lot but such a attitude and rudeness I have hardly discovered. The management should train their staff better and teach them that in the Hotel Business it‚Äôs all about customer service. Giving a good experience and being polite creates a good experience for the guests who will return again one day.    We wanted to stay for 5 days but decided to check out today. We are not willing to pay 400$ a night and get treated badly. There are many better 5 Star Hotels who will appreciate our business more.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samir1760

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Nawal Z wrote a review Feb 2019,50,Sofitel teams up with Moroccan hospitality,We visited for a short weekend to see family. From the check in to the departure we felt welcome and taken care of.  The rooms are nicely decorated Moroccan style and very comfortable. The bed is exactly what you need after a long flight or a long day walking around discovering the red city.  We tried breakfast at the main restaurant and room service and both were great a wide variety of international and Moroccan breakfast must have dishes.  Plenty of open space and recreational facilities one of the pools is heated in cold weather.  The service throughout the hotel is very good.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,RNPARIS wrote a review Dec 2018,30,"Good location, poor service",This hotel is well located but the service and attention to detail lets it down. I had a renovated room but there was one bright light behind some shelves that could only be switched off with the master switch which also cut the bedside lights. On the other hand the lighting in the bathroom was totally insufficient. A bit of decorative netting hanging above the bed made access to the bedside table difficult. The safe in the wardrobe was not attached to the wall but was just loose on a shelf.  The breakfast was good. Service in the bar which we used each evening after dinner was slow and inadequate. The cocktails were not comparable with those at The Mamounia which is only a 5 minute walk away.

Reception area lovely as are the external seating areas.    Room was a nice size with good views of the gardens and mountains in the distance.  Cleaners actually cleaned the room properly which was great to see ( rather than the cursory wipe and polish you often now get in hotels)  All the staff were polite and service was very good ‚Äì apart from at the bar again where I just gave up and walked up to ask for service several times.    Breakfast ok but a mixture of good average and frustrating ! the insistence on serving you pretty much all the drinks except smoothies is very frustrating as you have to wait to catch someone‚Äôs eye - so much easier to do self-service.  The pastries were lovely but the pound cakes (all 5 choices) are tasteless and hard.  The fresh fruit was limited and there were shot glasses with tiny bits of cut fruit in them - looks great but you would have to take 5 of them to get a small portion ?    Bread very poor ! Rolls like bullets as well  Only 2/3 types of fresh un cut bread ? So poor    The cooked food ‚Äì well over 50% of the choice is different types of Morrocan breads? The rest is cooked European but in covered pots so you can‚Äôt see what is in each ? the area is really cramped as well    The continental selection was good    Location is good ‚Äì 10 min walk to big supermarket 5 mins to various good restaurants and sky bars and 20 mins to the Medina and Square.,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carse66

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,THE TRAVELLER wrote a review Nov 2018,30,Beautiful hotel let down only by its staff !,We stayed for 4 nights and had a very mixed experience in terms of service levels. Certainly not what one would expect from a 5 star hotel charging these prices!  The location is excellent. The premises are stunning in both public areas pool area grounds restaurants and our suite.  We arranged to be met at airport by hotel car which worked brilliantly. Driver was lovely. We were seated at chairs in reception lounge to await private/personal check in. We were given a mint tea and a pastry but the reception staff had forgotten we were there and so check in was delayed! We were advised apout the spa and the nightclub amongst other hotel facilites- however we went to the spaonky to find it had been closed for a refurb!! So wrong information at check in. We were also told the nihhtclub closed at 5am- wrong- its 2am !  Escorted to our suite which was just beautiful - even a qelcoming hittle of water some pomegranates and small pastries- the next day sime small oasties and next 2 days - a bittle of water!!! We paid the same money for each nights accomodation and so expected the same (or at least similar everyday). That is not unreasonable.  The daily cleaning and servicing of the suite was hit and miss ! First night we had a turn diwn service and 7pm which worked brilliantly. The next day cushions and a thriw qere left off the bed amd we did bit fet a turn diwn service. Tea and coffee were not replaced! I complained to reception and got an apology but returned to our room later in the day amd tea and coffee had not been replaced!I went down to reception to complain and a manager gave it her personal attention amd we had tea and coffee within 15 minutes. However the following day they were not replaced again !!i also complained to the manager about the lack of turn down service and so she sent someone to do it at 17.45- before we had even got ready for dinner- and so a pointless exercise. The suite had not been serviced that day until between 3-4 pm (annoying in itself) and so this was just plain rediculous. The final night we received half the turn down service at 21.45!!!- far too late.    The breakfasts at this hotel are amazing and the best I have ever had. However the difference in service levels over the days was amazing!day one was wonderful as we had breakfast on the pool terrace. Day 2 we ate inside amd struggled to get the attention of waiters. At one point i actually placed dirty plates on the neighbouring empty table as they had been ignored for over 10 minutes !! Day three was even worse!!  We had booked a hotel car for return trip to airport. We had an early departure and so i decided to pay the bill on the night before departure- the receptionist was rude and objectionable and did not even ask if i had enjoyed my stay! I decided to just reconfirm pick up time of car with concierge- he hadnt got it in his diary? He asked who had booked it with and when i said it was with him- he denied this- no apology. Just rudeness! So- we could have missed our flight !!  So- in summary- a beautiful hotel - let down so very badly by its staff. The only staff who made a diffference to our stay were the wonderful pool staff and the driver! 5 star prices. 3 star service levels in all other areas !,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Malaga, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kingpaul100

It was totally not his fault that I had to wait around. I had a couple beers while I wanted. The beers cost 70 dirhams each. At the stores a Casablanca beer costs about 15 dirhams and in bars they may cost 30-40 dirhams so 70 is just absurd. My beer was served with walnuts and pistachios. They gave me a small dish to put the pistachio shells in! That is such a small convenience but I was shocked because I have lived in Morocco for a year and have never seen that before. Amazing! There were some pigeons and small brown birds that kinda got into my nuts.

It is close to the main city attractions the staff are helpful  it has an amazing swimming pool that unfortunately I couldn't use nice food helpful staff ...etc.    I stayed in this hotel for 5 business days. It is a close to the other main hotels. The hotel is around also 10-15 minutes from the town Souq - Market square which is great if you want to have a quick visit there.    The rooms exceeded my expectations they are plenty of room clean ‚Ä¶ definitely excellent rooms.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,ShammaBinySied wrote a review Aug 2018,50,An incredible hotel in an incredible city!,Wow!  This hotel has the best ambiance in town. The staff are so kind and welcoming. You almost feel like you‚Äôre at home. The rooms are clean and cozy. They even leave flowers on your bed (so cute!!) the views and pool are amazing. The bathrooms are also incredible. Everything about the room is beautiful. We had a balcony with our room (see picture below) which everyone enjoyed. But putting everything aside I feel like the most important thing in a hotel is the staff and the atmosphere and this hotel ticks both boxes. Definitely the hotel to be in when visiting Morocco.    ‚ù§Ô∏è,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShammaBinySied
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,573dk9999 wrote a review Aug 2018,40,Good location while visiting Marrakech,We stayed here on a package tour. A nice large property with modern rooms lots of services and facilities. Since we were there in December it was too cold to consider the pool which looked very nice. Several choices of restaurants and bars. We used the gift shop to scope out items to look for in the souk.    The one dinner we took in the hotel we chose the Orangerie and had Moroccan dishes. Probably a little adjusted for Western tastes but still a chance to try something new.    One advantage of a big place like this is that all of the taxis and horse drawn carriage drivers know where it is.    If we return to Marrakech we will consider staying here but don't feel strongly about it.,Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Iowa City, Iowa",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/573dk9999

The hotel is very glamorous offering a sophisticated elegance with its luxurious decor & gardens.    Checkin - nice warm welcome as Platinum Accor members.    Room - we were told we had an upgrade but I‚Äôm not sure we did as the room looked exactly the same as I had booked.    Regardless we were very happy with the quality of comfort. Although the room was looking like it needed a makeover. Our room had nice views of the pool with a sweet balcony covered with bougainvillea .    Facilities- enormous swimming pools which was extremely crowded & not very inviting due to the crowds. Getting a deck chair would be arduous work. Luckily we didn‚Äôt feel like swimming.    Location- 10 minute walk from Koutoubia Mosque & 15 Minutes from Jemaa el Fna Square.    Restaurants- we enjoyed a lovely French dinner at the fine dining restaurant L Organerie & drinks at the Lawrence Bar.    Pool restaurant was okay but the service was extremely slow mainly because the pool  Area was extremely crowded.    Breakfast- good variety however the room was extremely busy we felt like we were apart of a tour group.    Overall - comfortable stylish stay  spacious room interesting amenities & restaurants.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Yaz0123 wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Truly Exquisite Hotel,Stayed at this hotel for a week and I can‚Äôt recommend it enough. From the smooth check in process to the customer service. The hotel is truly exquisite from the Moment you walk in We booked a deluxe junior suite which had a walk in wardrobe living room and 40inch TVs in both the rooms. We had amazing views of Hivernage especially in the evening when the hotel is lit up. The only negatives are the fact the rooms aren‚Äôt sound proof you can hear the music from SO Lounge however when we complained about the music they turned it down straight away that‚Äôs what you call fantastic customer service. The room didn‚Äôt include a balcony which was quite disappointing however the view made up for it. A big shout out to Ahmed in security every time we came back to the hotel and left he always greeted me by my name which was a great touch. We were truly spoilt with the widespread breakfast buffet the pastries and bakery was on point they have live crepe and omelette stations and cook to your taste.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Arthur F wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Elegant French Service in a Fabulous Moroccan City,My wife and I recently spent three days at the Marrakech Sofitel as part of a small high-end group tour of Morocco. It is a beautiful well run hotel offering a nice bit of French style and elegance to travelers.    The rooms are large and well-appointed with all necessary amenities nice views of the Atlas Mountains and the pool/outdoor dining area of the hotel. Staff is very well trained and the food offerings are superb. We experienced both the breakfast and lunch buffets as well as a lovely private group dinner. The buffets were among the most extensive ever experienced with wonderful French cuisine.    One final comment. On the day of our arrival we noticed a small leak in the bathroom sink. We reported this to the hotel management and it was repaired promptly. In addition the hotel manager offered us a meal of our choosing at the hotel's expense.

Asked several different servers for some only to be told they would get some but never returned. Finally approached the host who got some for our table.

We were originally given an old unrenovated room that smelled like cigarette smoke and boasted stained carpets- not 5 star at all. We were satisfied once our room had been changed.    The bad:  -terrible service. Hotel seriously understaffed at the restaurants and pool. Very difficult to even order a meal let alone get served or have a towel.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,AdventB4Dementia wrote a review May 2018,30,Worth a Stay,This hotel was booked by our tour group. After staying at the Sofitel in Casablanca it was a great improvement on aesthetics. These things matter if you are staying more than a night I think. It appears to be a favourite of the French. The pools are amazing it has some fabulous artwork throughout. The room was terrific bed and linen fabulous. We felt safe here.    We did experience some problems with translation. Numbers are wrong on phones e.g. to ring laundry (housekeeping). Reception giving wrong number to call. Staff training in subtlety and when to leave guests alone. E.g. had dinner in our room and when finished put tray outside as we wanted to sleep after a long day but got a knock on our door to see if we‚Äôve finished and could our tray be taken away.    Breakfast was fun. Never was a table set properly. Had to go looking for cutlery. Staff just took cutlery etc from another table. Then the next guests came along and same problem just snowballed. Watching staff appearing to argue about who was responsible for doing what was interesting. But the breakfast spread was terrific. Had all the breakfast delights to set you up for the day.    The lifts have had their day. Must be very old. They were supposed to take 250kilos but could only manage Two or one with luggage.    On checkout our bill didn‚Äôt have all the expenses we had booked to it. We weren‚Äôt the only ones. Lucky we are honest.    Overall this hotel was lovely to stay in and would stay there again.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,David M wrote a review Apr 2018,30,Poor 5*,I will try to be as brief as possible.    Sofitel Marrakech is not a 5* Hotel in any shape or form.  Let‚Äôs start with the one positive. The pool area and the loungers ( sun beds ) are great.  Now with the negatives:    Rooms are not kept well at all. Only after asking why our bed had not been changed after 6 nights along with no vacuuming and generally poor housekeeping did we see an improvement. We had to ask for that basic service.    Breakfast although we laughed about it after a couple of days the staff were constantly arguing with each other. You ask one person to do something and they asked another person to do it which resulted in nothing being done. Generally the hygiene of the tables was asking for tummy upsets. No leadership skills anywhere to be seen.    Staff generally but not every single member was miserable. No smiles. Everything was just too much trouble.    Restaurants. We ate at all of them and although not poor not good. There are some great restaurants all within a KM or 2.    I have stayed at many 5* hotels in western and 3rd world countries so I appreciate that their standards are never the same but unfortunately the Sofitel was well below any standard it should be.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,denverroadtrip wrote a review Apr 2018,40,Well Run at All Levels,I was concerned as I approached the hotel after reading of aloof staff. Yet everyone was lovely. The bellman who took our bags and sat us on the sofa (in a vip section according to a placard) was warm and professional. He informed the front desk staff of our (early) arrival. We were given tea and comfortably went through the check in process. The concierge visited to give us maps and suggestions but seemed to really want us to hire a tour guide for the day. When I said I was not interested (having been in Marrakech for two days already) he vanished.    After waiting for an available room I approached the front desk and upon realizing we were there only for 1 night were upgraded to a lovely corner room (w/two terraces- nice!). The room had all the touches of a 5 star hotel as did the bathroom. Later in the day we returned to a tray full of sweets which were yummy.    We used the spa and enjoyed the breakfast buffet. Both were what's expected from a 5 star hotel- luxurious and near perfect. The indoor spa pool was sublime. The outdoor pools and lounge areas were large welcoming and once again luxurious. All the public spaces were well appointed and interesting.    PROBLEM: I killed too many ants in the room and even on my leg.    It's a shame some people had staff problems because we found everyone to be warm and professional. I would be excited to stay here again.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,V&A wrote a review Mar 2018,30,Lovely property,First of all this is a large hotel. The entrance and the reception area is lovely. However given the size of the property the trek to your room can be a long one.    The hotel is in a central location and is within walking distance of most places of interest. Rooms are large though poorly equipped in terms of storage and places to put things away especially if you‚Äôre not alone in the room and if you are staying more than a day longer. Front desk is difficult to reach probably because of the sheer size of this place. The breakfast buffet is outstanding in terms of selection and service though getting your coffee delivered to the table may take a while hence the word of the advice: order immediately upon arrival.    The pools are lovely though for some weird reason they close at 6 pm. The bar closes at 11 pm. We got there at 10:40 pm and no one would serve us and when we asked we were told they are about to close. Go figure.    Room service is very slow luggage was misdelivered and it took a few hours to get it.    In summary a nice property with average service and decent restaurant.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Furby98 wrote a review Mar 2018,50,Beautiful Hotel,We have just returned from a long weekend in Marrakesh staying at the Sofitel.  When we arrived we were sat in reception and greeted with towels to refresh our hands and then were given mint tea and macaroons . As we were too early for check in they took our bags and we were free to explore the hotel.  We decided to stay in the hotel and had lunch on the terrace by the pool. The food was delicious and we were very well looked after by Mohammed.  The hotel is very comfortable and the pool area is stunning . Plenty of large beds but we sadly didn‚Äôt get to try them out as the weather was just awful. It turned very chilly and the rain was relentless.  We were able to get into our room for about 3pm and were very impressed. We had a very large bed and the room had a very luxurious feel about it. The lighting is a little dim but you can just lie in bed and switch everything on or off.  The shower was to die for ... it‚Äôs a walk in shower with a large shower rainfall head and very powerful.  We were able to freshen up and relax in the lovely dressing gowns and slippers.... the stress of the travelling drifted away.  Breakfast is just amazing ... lots to choose from and offered freshly cooked omelettes or any type of eggs ... all sorts of breads  huge variety of fruit freshly made waffles and crepes .... meats cheeses  olives  pastries ... just too much to chose from all polished off with a choice of teas and coffee and lovely orange juice.  There are only one or two things to say that could be better.... if your French speaking you seem to be served quicker .... when we checked in we could have been given a nap of the area and suggestions of what to do / where to go... we had been to Marrakesh the year before so we‚Äôre not daunted by finding our own way around but had this been our first visit to the area this could have spoilt our break. Saying that I‚Äôm sure if you asked for help or advice the friendly staff would have gone out of their way to help .  As you walk out of the hotel you are jumped upon by guides saying they work for the hotel touting for business cab drivers called to the front of the hotel charge you more than if you walk around the corner and get your own taxi or you can jump into the horse and carriage... make sure you negotiate the prices!!  Because your walking out of a lovely hotel they assume your rich and charge you more !!  I would thoroughly recommend the Sofitel as an Calm and safe environment away from all the madness of the M√©dina .  We will definitely book again ...

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Rachel T wrote a review Mar 2018,40,Fabulous stay but 1 warning,Our second visit to Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial did not disappoint. Beautiful grounds make this a really spectacular location for a few days relaxing and we were lucky enough to have a great pool view one side of our room and the Atlas Mountains from the other.    Highly recommend dinner at The Orangerie food was fab and not too expensive considering the quality.    The concierge is super helpful and offers very personal service.    Unfortunately when we were checking out and paying our final bill which we chose to do via Dirham it seems as though one member of staff was keen to rip us off. We luckily had counted our remaining currency before checking out and when presenting the money to the reception they informed us they had a money counting machine to determine how much was there. We gave him 4000MAD however after putting through the machine he told us it was just 2000MAD. When we asked to get him to put it through the machine again he then said it was actually 3000MAD and asked for the remaining balance to be paid on card.  We demanded he count it in front of us in person and of course there was the full 4000MAD in his hands. I would like to think this was just a mistake of the machine however his attitude and the fact he did not apologise makes me think would have liked to have pocketed the 2000MAD he miscounted for himself. So word of warning please do not assume their note counter is correct!,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/670rachelt

Their kindness is sincere and will surprise you.  - The rooms the three pools the restaurants all perfect.  - Get the breakfast it is really good and a lot of choices.    Having stayed in many Sofitel this one is not for everyone. It won't likely be for me next time: It is a large hotel for a Sofitel with hundreds of rooms. We were there in February and it was already quite busy. I can't imagine how crowded this place can be during the peak season with many kids running around.  And then there is the smoking. I live in California. I'm not used to this anymore. But you will see people smoking all around the public area: Lobby restaurants etc. Very annoying.    Most people will find this hotel a 5 stars. For me it was a 4 stars and not one I will likely return to because of the negative points mentioned above.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"San Francisco, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chris9876543

However what made our honeymoon fabulous and memorable was the first class service we received from the staff especially Wuassife Sarah Mehdi Sana from the Palais Darkomm department and Atoul Mahdi Bentaleb Mehdi Laanibra from the reception department and Nasir from So Lounge was just exceptional they couldn't have done enough and went out their way to make our trip very special going beyond to meet our expectations.    Thank you again for the cute surprises you had provided us throughout our stay truly amazing.    I will definitely be booking up to stay with you guys on my next visit very soon.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SKN1984
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Fontenelle A wrote a review Jan 2018,50,lovely hotel,This is a nice hotel. The pools are lovely but its a pity we did not bathe in it because the water was cold but nice for relaxing in the sun. All the restaurants are amazing. Room service was quick as well.The night club was great. There was a live band every night during our stay and they were wonderful. I find the rooms are a bit dark as there were not many lights and the room numbers are a bit confusing as there are so many different elevators. But we had a beautiful view from our balcony.,Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fontenellea
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Mary Jo Z wrote a review Jan 2018,50,"Amazing Hotel, Service and Breakfast",We were a large group and we were worried about travelling in Morocco so we stuck with one of the hotel chains we knew and did not regret the decision. The hotel is spectacularly beautiful and the service amazing. The breakfast had everything you could imagine and was maybe the best hotel breakfast I have had. There was something for everyone. The hotel is large and it can be difficult to find your room as well as a long walk from the lobby to your room.,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"The Hague, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maryjoz673

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,GiuliaFarr wrote a review Jan 2018,50,Definite-must for Marrackech,I'm a fan of the Sofitel brand and the Marrakech edition was spectacular. The lobby was so inviting as well the pool-side restaurant that was available for lunch. I even enjoyed the hotel's spa and hammam. Although I've stayed in a riad before the Sofitel will always be the choice for this city. Also it's located in the new city and for those visiting for the first time it would be a better choice since the medina might be overwhelming for some.,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Sarasota, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/giuliafarr19

I would like to especially mention two people who were particularly outstanding: Saad at the front desk and Jarid Ikram.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Justin R wrote a review Jan 2018,50,A fusion of Morocco with a little French flair,Great location just outside the Medina but easy walking distance to Jemaa el-Fna. A fusion of Morocco with a strong French influence.    Prestige Suite was very nice. Excellent house keeping and great service from our butler Zakaria. Suite was a lot nicer than the pictures for the room shown on Accor.com    Food and drink in the hotel high quality although expensive. Breakfast buffet very good. Loved to Moroccan pancakes and excellent citrus fruit.    Service was friendly although a little slow on occasions but that is Morocco. Slow the pace and enjoy.    Nice pool area although can get busy although pool beds always available.    What we did not like is the absence of non smoking restaurant and bar areas. A excellent lunch or drink too often spoilt by high level of smoking guests in restaurants and bars.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Sophie wrote a review Dec 2017,20,Not worth it,I‚Äôll be concise hope it‚Äôll be helpful. Stayed there 6 days during Christmas in a room on the first floor.    The good:    - working WiFi throughout  - large sun beds  - outdoor pools & grounds  - the staff at breakfast‚Äôs omelette station  - the raspberry cocktail at Lawrence bar    The bad (long list):    - the long freezing corridors to get to room (10mins walk each time)  - pricey drinks (140dhs cocktail) and food (190dhs salad)  - the bedroom‚Äôs old and dusty decor  - walls not soundproof you can hear everything from kids club to people next door. Cannot rest properly.  - the bed which was too small for the frame causing multiple leg bruises  - the 30cm gap between the bed and the nightstands impossible to reach for anything (see picture)  - the small bathroom with dripping oil/paint(?) a bit gross. (See pics)  - lack of body lotion  - products not being replenished each day (had to call twice to get cotton swabs)    The unacceptable :    - the Spa manager‚Äôs disdainful attitude and  total lack of service. She was my trip‚Äôs biggest disappointment the reason why I didn‚Äôt buy any products in the end didn‚Äôt swim once and the reason why I shall never go back to this hotel.  She (short hair glasses) does not deserve her job.  - the lack of skill and courtesy from unhelpful concierge (the big one)  - one night we came back to room without a drop of running water. Hence cannot wash hands cannot shower cannot go to WC. It took 3 phone calls and over one hour of insisting and speaking to manager to get the issue fixed.    Conclusion :    - a 3 star hotel at best  - not good enough to be named a Sofitel  - not coming back so many other great places to stay in Marrakech    @management: please do not copy and paste your usual reply to this review. Use the time & effort to just get better.,Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sophieflies

From the service at the valet receptionists breakfast room pool stuff and room service -all have exceptional service. The hotel is located at the heart of hivernage which is the center of everything. Lots of bars restaurantsclubs shopping and all are only steps away. The first thing that you notice when you enter the hotel is the Rose water smell which is an amazing smell the welcome tea and moroccan cookies they serve is just delicious. The decoration is just stunning. It is fancy yet authentic. The pool is just huge rooms are spacious and clean! Food at breakfast was very delicious and there is a big variety.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,SpencerHanlon wrote a review Nov 2017,40,OK - Faded property and service was not consistently five star,My wife and I travelled to the Sofitel for four nights in the sun before Christmas. The hotel is nice there are plenty of loungers around the pool and places to relax. Food in the hotel was very good. Two very nice lunches by the pool and the breakfast buffet is well worth signing up for. A real treat.    The room was spacious being a suite but quite dark (not enough internal lighting) and looked dated. The balcony was nice and a great place to relax.    Standout was the WiFi which is very easy to use you are always connected and quick enough to download and even watch NetFlix by the pool.    As an Accor Platinum member we were upgraded on arrival which was very nice but for some reason did not receive the 10% discount on food and beverage which I was surprised with.    Service was mostly friendly but somewhat slow - a long time to take orders and then a long time to come back which was strange as there are loads of staff.    On checkout - the service was gruff and not friendly. Which is a shame as it left a poor impression on leaving the property.,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Beaconsfield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SpencerHanlon

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,larissabatt wrote a review Nov 2017,40,Very nice but not 5*,So let‚Äôs start with the positives: the pool area is very nice the bed is super comfy (as one would expect from a Sofitel) I appreciated the kettle in the room there is a nice little gym breakfast was pretty good in terms of food the location is great - it‚Äôs in the quiet new town but you can still walk to the souks etc. I thought the price was good.    Room for improvement: service is the main thing. It took forever to get served coffee at breakfast I was quoted one price on Saturday to get my hair blow dried and another price on the Tuesday (I had to challenge the spa to give me the original price quoted). In the restaurant we were told one set of information from one waiter and something else by another regarding prices and the buffet etc    The other thing was the lighting in our room was really poor - if I didn‚Äôt have a kindle with a back light it would have been near to impossible to read in bed. Also they should consider having a magnifying mirror somewhere because the mirror in the bathroom is quite far away and it‚Äôs really difficult to do your make up. Our room was on the ground floor - my father-in-laws room on the third floor was much better in these respects.    All in all I would stay again because of the location but I would lower my expectations and I would request a room not on the ground floor.,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/larissabatt
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,LouisSaintCalbre wrote a review Nov 2017,40,October perfect...,You want sun warmth good food and a place to chill...the Sofitel is a great place for that.    The personnel is friendly and professional. The overall atmosphere is soothing and elegant enough.    It's not perfect few places are but it is a very good deal for the money.  We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite which could use a redecoration and a real 2nd bathroom but was nonetheless very comfortable.    The pools are super. There are 3. One is heated great for kids and folks who prefer warm water. There are 2 main restaurants for lunch and the same for diner though you may want to venture out after a couple of days.  Breakfast is awesome.    There is a kid's club and the hotel will find you a nanny if you should need one at night or during the day.    It's located in the golden triangle. A 10 minute ride to Jemaa El-Fna...and its great smells and bustle. Stay away from the food stands. There are assuredly a couple of decent ones but its a lottery unless you have a strong recommendation.    You can walk to Morocco's most renown Casino. There are a couple of clubs and bars 3 minutes away.  La table du March√© across the street from the hotel is a very nice little restaurant and they are super with kids.    All in all I would recommend the Sofitel despite its shortcomings it is Marrakech after all.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Paris, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LouisSaintCalbre
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Robyn T wrote a review Nov 2017,30,A little disappointing for a Sofitel,"The hotel was lovely but the concierge was not well supervised. He booked a city tour for us and hired an acquaintance who was impatient condescending and ended the tour early. The cost of the tour seemed to be whatever the concierge could convince you to pay and his take came off the top. We agreed on $180 for four people to tour the city for the day. He then attempted to take 180 euros saying it was a ""misunderstanding"". Our guide left us after 3 hours. We spoke to another couple at the pool who paid $25 to the same concierge for two people to have a day tour. Their guide told them they were ""driving him crazy with their questions"" and he too left just short of 2.5 hours. Don't use the hotel for anything other than your room. Their airport shuttle is 10 times the cost of other shuttles. We were charged $11 for two  10 oz bottles of water on our bathroom counter.

Also the tv in the room didn‚Äôt work although it was later fixed the problem is that they have very few channels for English speaking people basically cnn and bbc news.The first time I went to the pool they gave us semi wet towells I suposse they had already been used also the furniture at the pool is kind of old and somewhat dirty l.

The setting with the infinity type pool the warmglowing sunsets and the comfortable seating was given a special touch by the Manager Wiam and her supporting staff - Ciam Tariq and Medi.They could not do enough for us and made our evenings before dinner a sheer delight.

This Hotel has 2 sides to the same place and all facilities are shared. Exception being the Spa side has more modern rooms. Otherwise it is the same Hotel.    We were in a Superior Double room on the ground floor. The room was clean and the A/C worked great as it was much needed with the 40 degrees Centigrade outside!!    Pool was very clean with waiter service and food that could be purchased. Lots of available extremely comfortable beds and umbrellas. Hotel Towels are laid out in the morning on all beds but extra towels can be requested.    Overall food was of very good quality and tasty we stayed on a B&B basis  and the breakfasts buffet was very varied but please don't expect a full English Breakfast!!    In the evening there were a couple of restaurants on-site but we chose not to eat in them. Lunchtimes there was the Pool restaurant which as stated was very good.    Facilities include excellent free Wi-Fi throughout. The common areas are very nicely appointed and are very comfortable.    Staff were very friendly throughout although the evening Bar was on occasion had quite slow service. The staff also went out of their way to help you.    Most of the other guests were French or Moroccan with a scattering of other nationalities. So French speakers will find it to their liking. English was spoken by the majority of staff but not every single one could speak it fluently.    This is one of the luxurious Hotels in Marrakech and some of the food and drink prices were much higher but there are a few other restaurants within easy walking distance if you wanted to eat out.

We were on Half Board a little confusing I would stick to BB just because the hotel have a complicated way to account for your dinner or lunch which either you choose to take. took an hour at check out to sort and the Guest Relations Manager to assist again lovely Man shame we met him upon check out.    Our rooms one a deluxe twin lovely really authentic our room was a junior suite lovely spacious room problem was our balcony was over grown and pigeons nested in the plants we ended up being moved after a few days as pigeons came in the room something I have never experienced before or wish to again so be aware a lot of bird life big and small all over the hotel.    little things took a long time and I thought us a British need to relax go slow and enjoy our vacation but it wasn't that staff genuinely didn't respond to requests. coat hangers more required to 4 conversations Milk for nespresso machine never came gave up ordering drinks around the pool took for ever plenty of staff on hand. staff would talk among themslelves rather than be delivering excellent service. Dinner food quality was good but again allow 3/4 hours service is slow.    The pools lovely pool beds comfy towels plenty around lunch around the pool good standard of quality and service good.    There was a pool party one day didn't see what the whole concept of it  meant also they have a lovely spa and each day the ladies walked around the pool oppportunity missed if they interacted with the Guests many would have loved some form of treatment but they again just stood talking. a lot of scope to improve customer service by staff being more attentive. hotel is lovely good location we explored and ate out and some fantastic restuarants it is a real gem of a hotel and has some very good staff two around the pool we were room 420 they will remember us from the UK  one last note drinks expensive but they are in all hotels selling branded alcohol.,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Rhodes, Greece",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachaels686

The service was good the rooms were nice pool area was great but the concierge is a total rip off! We booked with Reda and he demanded cash instead of credit card or charging to the room.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Jim H wrote a review Jul 2017,10,Nowhere near as good as it thinks it is.,Initial appearance of the hotel has a wow factor as did the lobby and welcome drink. The 'please take a tea' while we checked in dragged out to over 30 minutes whereby we're told that there was a problem with our booking made through an internet travel agent as our credit cards didn't match the booking. Of course they didn't. The travel agent had booked with theirs. We were made to feel like criminals as we were told that the credit card used to book must be the same as presented on arrival. This was not sorted out until the day of check out when we had a preauthorisation refunded. Bedroom was dark and bed and pillows far too soft. Laundry service poor needing a search for shirts to be made and the food/drink while acceptable was stupidly expensive.  The predominant type of patron was young and self-entitled. At one stage we saw an obese young man filming one of the staff on his phone and making him sing. Whilst the member of staff complies with the guests request a punch in the face would have been a better response.  Despite ordering a car for our departure it was not there when required and turned up late. Flight was nearly missed because of this.  Would I stay here again? No.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Harlow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jimhA5202GY

They told us to wait for 5mins which became half an hour. After a long flight we were very tired but they didn't care. After a long time which seemed like a century the luggage man who seemed the only nice person there took us to the room. The room was located at least a km away and we had to use a old elevator. The lights in the room were not working. Overall service bad. The smell in the hotel not good. Similarly another customer had made a reservation but the concierge had a problem locating that too.

The location is perfect with wonderful restaurants nearby and is also very close the Jamaa al Fna square.    The hotel is maintained to a very high standard the staff are amazing and humble and its nice seeing a friendly face. I am also impressed that when I return each year they have done something amazing to it whether it be building a new pool or completely refurbing the rooms/lounge or pool area.    I have just returned from Marrakech after a 4 night stay celebrating a girlfriends birthday and although we had a few minor problems initially at the beginning I was impressed with how they turned everything around. I also have to highly praise/congratulate Ikram Jarid (Rooms Division Director) for the personal service she gave our group.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,PRJ wrote a review Jun 2017,40,Family visit,This is a nice hotel. Not perfect but a good standard.  Firstly it was both clean and maintained to a good standard. Breakfast was well managed and enjoyable. We ate in one of the restaurant's during the evening with a mainly well heeled local crowd. The manager took great pride in showing us the many different foods to try.    What we have found is that during Ramadan things don't always happen very quickly. At the weekend service around the pool is sporadic at times.  Staff are well turned-out and I especially wish to compliment the female staff at reception for their friendly welcome and ability to keep smiling throughout the long summer days.    There was some renovation work on one wing but this should not intrude on your visit or enjoyment. Ideally located.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,AgneRa wrote a review Jun 2017,40,"Great food, dated rooms and spa",Surrounded by lush greenery this hotel is a proper oasis in the madness of Marrakesh. It's only 10 minute walk from Medina which is perfect for sightseeing.  Pool area does get crowded. And it should be as everyone wants to spend some time (or whole day if you like!) on those comfy sun loungers. Pool bar is delish!  This part of the hotel is in need of a facelift however I would personally opt for it again simply because rooms in Lounge & Spa side are too Europeanish.    DO:  Try the restaurants they are perfect! Most of them offer local dishes as well as European / French ones. Portions are enormous! Breakfast is incredible too with so much choice you will end up going a size up.  Book a tour to souks - we gave it a try even though we felt we could do it ourselves; you will get to know more about the city people and history from a local than you would on your own.    DON'T:  Take a taxi from the hotel or just outside it you will pay double the price.  Expect a fast service. It not the way it goes in Marrakech.  Go to their spa. It's overpiced and dated. Massage was alright though.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AgneRa

Room was spacious and spotless although bathroom a bit""motel like"".  Dinner and drinks are very expensive and after one night we went outside. They seem to want it to be a nightclub outside.    Apart from the expensive dinner and drinks there are 2 little things which kept us from rating it 5. One is a cold jacuzzi (?) weird. The other is a concierge who cons guests into using the very expensive limo cars. We were told that taxis not reliable for going to the golf course/ won't pick you up etc. So were charged 500 (he said 600 at first) for transport. Next time we went we got a taxi who happily picked us up after. For 50! We found they make you feel scared so you pay out unnecessarily.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Alison wrote a review Apr 2017,30,0 star service for 5 star prices,For the cost of this hotel you get absolutely 0 service. We have stayed in several sofitels recently including one in Bangkok that we thought was phenomenal but the sofitel palais in Marrakech was one of the worst experiences we've ever had service and experience wise.    The hotel lobby is very beautiful but the rooms themselves are small dark and outdated. Whenever we asked for the most basic request they would go unanswered unless we repeatedly called/chased someone down. It was as if they would hope you would forget what you asked for so they wouldn't have to do their jobs. Nothing was delivered on the first attempt. We had to flag down a waiter several times at the outdoor bar to take our order in fact the waiters actively avoid eye contact and one literally jogged away from us when we tried to get his attention.    Sadly from there the service only got worse. I called and asked for toothpaste and a towel. 45 minutes later still nobody had arrived. I asked a waiter at the pool for a menu so I could order lunch. He just never returned. For the prices we are paying there is a certain level of service warranted this was not delivered. Twice someone tried to enter our room using a keycard when I wasn't dressed. The first time was a service person delivering something who chose  to enter without knocking. The second time someone attempted to come in and I pushed the door shut as I was in the bathroom which was terrifying. When my husband opened the door 10 seconds later whoever had opened the door had run away. We went to the front desk to complain as we weren't sure if it was staff or another customer whose key card still worked. They offered to check security tapes. They never followed up. When we went back to ask them they had the audacity to ask me if I was sure if someone had tried to enter our room and brushed us off again. They said they would again check the tapes. Still no response. Considering what a major breach of privacy that was you would expect a sense of urgency. But that is par for the course for them to ignore the issue and hope it goes away. As such we don't even feel secure in the hotel. We haven't asked for the room to be cleaned and since my husbands valuable camera equipment could not be left alone in the room and will not fit in the safe we are forced to keep everything on us when we leave the hotel room. I know there's a cultural difference but we ate out every night and never encountered the same experience.    Overall I have been extremely disappointed in sofitel. I write this review at the pool 45 minutes after I have asked for a menu and nobody has returned. I wish I had used the money on a much cheaper riad known for their service versus a well known brand hotel which is clearly leaning on the brand name and caring absolutely 0 about their customers. I will not be returning nor staying in another sofitel. Wear your sneakers when you come to this hotel because you'll be doing a lot of chasing after things if you're hungry thirsty or in need of a towel. I got the sense that their motto was the customer is always wrong.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alisonl741

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,DaveChicago_Illinois wrote a review Apr 2017,40,Resort Hotel,Most of the hotels that you stay in in Morocco are a place to stay while you do business or see the sights. This hotel is a resort location with a big pool area. I believe that it was spring break in the Paris region while I was there and there were as many kids as adults in the hotel. What I'm trying to say is that is was a little loud although French kids are the best behaved in public as any that I have seen in the world.    I was staying in room 420 and the first night they were moving furniture until 11:00 at night in the room above me. Furniture was being dropped and things being rolled around. The rooms themselves seem very dark but they are comfortable.    The check-in is very weird. You go in the main entrance but then go about 200 feet to the right to check in. However you check out at the main lobby.    Trying to figure out the elevators drove me crazy. For the first two days the call button for the elevator at one end of the hall on my floor didn't work so I went down a floor and got on the elevator. There was another elevator nearer to my room but it never worked in the morning but worked in the afternoon and evening. Go figure.

Worst are breakfast staff; They are plenty but are more busy chatting or looking busy than actually doing their job)    A general remark: in France the service have improved over past 5 years. Hotels and restaurants have no longer the ""old French attitude"" to tourist. They have upgraded.    Sofitel in Marrakech still is having this combination of ""old French attitude"" combined with North African efficiency. You can imagine the outcome!

During our stay in February 2017 the weather was perfect making it perfect for a poolside lunch or snack. Our room had a separate ‚Äúwater closet‚Äù with the tub and sink being in a separate room. All were large clean and well taken care of. The bed was very comfortable there were multiple large closets and there was an in-room safe big enough for a large laptop.    Our room had a beautiful balcony facing the pool area and it was warm enough for some brave souls to use the pool. Absolutely our only negative point about this hotel is that birds seem to spend every night on the hanging ceiling lamp on our room‚Äôs balcony necessitating cleaning the floor by the maids every morning. (I suggest they buy and install ‚Äúbird repellent spikes‚Äù on those lamps.)    Being in a very modern urban area within a large city there were a number of restaurants and store within walking distance some of which we went to. The hotel is very conveniently located.

The location of the hotel is quite good and is within easy walking distance of the Katubia Mosque the Medina and other areas of interest. There is also a grocery store about 3 blocks away which I used one day when I was too tired to go anywhere. I picked up fresh bread olives dates cheese and a bottle of wonderful white Moroccan wine.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,John H wrote a review Mar 2017,40,"Beautiful resort, but paper thin walls!","I spent 3 nights at this hotel which looks beautiful from the outside (especially when it's lit up at night) and it is conveniently located for everything you'll want to do in Marrakech. The resort property is beautiful -- huge pool poolside dining at lunch nice terrace bar . . . the lobby is spacious and beautifully decorated. I didn't use the spa but it looked inviting.    The hotel is in a good area of the city so it's safe to walk to area restaurants and there are many. Best to know that some do not serve dinner until 8 p.m. You can ask the concierge for information but you might not get a lot of help -- I asked about the area restaurants and the answer was ""They are all the same. International."" Well they are not all the same -- across the street is a very good Moroccan restaurant and about 2 blocks beyond there's an excellent Italian restaurant.    There is a casino a block away but I did not visit.    I walked about 15 minutes to the old medina (city) and that was interesting. You pass through the old walls that were built to protect the city and you pass by a huge park that includes a mosque. You'll eventually arrive at a square where there's a variety of nighttime entertainment -- but mostly you'll find cafes restaurants and a variety of shops.    I hired a guide to give me a tour of Marrakech and we spent a great deal of time in the medina which includes an old palace that's worth the visit. Of course guides are ""entrepreneurs"" and they have their favorite places where they can get their commissions if you buy . . . I didn't mind that my guide took me to a berber carpet shop and also to an oils and perfumes shop. If you don't want to buy just say so.    There are two downsides to the hotel. First the sleeping rooms (while spacious) have paper-thin walls. So one night I was awakened by a woman yelling in Spanish -- she was yelling into her phone to someone back home -- I could hear someone yelling back at her because she was using the speaker on her phone. This was about 1 a.m. Next night 4 a.m. the couple next door arrived and ""carried on"" for about an hour. I've stayed in many hotels through the years and I've never had this bad of an experience with hearing the neighbors.    The breakfast buffet is huge and all of the food that I tried was excellent -- but good luck getting the attention of the wait staff. Same crew on duty all 4 mornings that I had breakfast. Twice I chose a table that was on the end so that the wait staff had to pass me and I figured it would be easy to get their attention for coffee and juice. Not so! They are more interested in discussing their social lives than they are in paying attention to customers. I wouldn't have minded getting my own coffee and juice but that wasn't possible. This is more a matter of bad management than it is bad staff.    I rated the hotel 4 stars because there are so many positives about it -- but in truth I would never stay there again.",Date of stay: February 2017,Trip type: Traveled solo,"West Palm Beach, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/John52342

Have to say we are bitterly disappointed with the standard of the hotel which just isn't up to Sofitel standards. We have stayed in many Sofitel hotels and this one is frankly a joke.  We have stayed in their so called Opera Suite which is supposed to be their best room. Suffice to say the rooms are outdated and the bathrooms are frankly bordering on revolting they are so old. The pool area is nice and the service is ok at best - there does not seem to be many members of staff who understand much English. It is advertised that they have a kids play area- they do not apart from an old plastic playhouse in a dangerous edge of the complex where chairs are stacked up and which looks like it's been there many years and I would never let my kids play in.  The indoor pool we are not allowed to use with kids- would have been nice to have been told this before we booked given that the weather at this time of the year is sometimes a little unpredictable.  Generally I would not recommend anyone to stay here.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,MJOMH wrote a review Feb 2017,10,Do not stay here!!,We have stayed multiple times at 5 star international hotels but this hotel's service is below 1 star.  The breakfast staff is completely incompetent! Every morning we had to order our coffee tea and water multiple times because either they did not bring our order at all or brought the wrong drinks. The table was dirty as were the chairs. The staff just wiped the previous guests' bread crumbs with their hands from the table (missing half the crumbs around the table deco and the rest landed on the chair).  Also my wife's glasses were stolen from our room. My wife was 100% sure that she left them in the room however I convinced her to ask at the reception if they were found at the poolside (benefit of doubt). We requested to speak to the manager who indirectly called my wife a liar because we asked if they were found at the poolside therefore the glasses could not have been stolen from our room. We tried to follow up with the manager however she responded that they will not look further into the issue. We have more than enough money to purchase the glasses again but how the hotel reacted and dealt with our complaint is disgusting and disgraceful.  Also twice staff followed us after their shift ended to the city centre and tried to take us to stores (to earn commission) and did not leave us alone although we insinuated we don't want to buy anything.  I recommend everyone to stay away from this hotel if you are used to a decent service. Sofitel should train their staff better or not call them self a 5 star hotel.

The bed is so painful not the Sofitel standard I am used to (woke up with back pains everyday). And the service is the worst I have ever seen. No one really understands English you pretty much wait 30 minutes for a coffee or a glass of water which had to be re-ordered multiple times.

The hotel staff follow you when you you leave the hotel to go to to the square they approach and walk with you and try to get you into the their ""brothers Argan oil store"" to earn commission (this happened to us twice) exploiting hotel guests to make money on the side is absolutely disgusting and I pretty much see it as harassment.    I will never come back here again. Sofitel should evaluate their standards and educate their staff on how to provide good service.

Nothing was done...  Came back to the reception the ""public relations manager"" overheard the conversation I was having with the front desk personnel and he intervened asking me to go back to my room pack my stuff and they would call me shortly to change my room.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,bournesupreme wrote a review Nov 2016,40,Amazing stay -,I arrived at this hotel with my friends to begin our 3 night stay in a Luxury room with views of the Koutoubia and ramparts. Upon arriving at the reception lobby we were asked to take a seat and hand over our passports. Whilst we were waiting for the check-in formalities to be completed a staff member came across to us and offered us nice cold towels to cool our tired faces and hot mint tea to ease our parched throats.    The check in was completed within 15 minutes. Although the staff member did actually charge my friends credit card for the incidentals as opposed to preauthorising it. Once identified the matter was quickly resolved.    The lobby is open and spacious scattered with comfortable sofa cushion style seating. We were taken to our room and upon first impressions it became clear that all the previous criticisms of the room lighting being low and not bright did seem true. However this did not bother me a great deal. If I was staying with children then this dimly lit room would have been more of an issue. The room has a quirky layout. As you walk in there is a toilet and then you go into the main section of the bedroom. There was a 42 inch Philips Ambilight TV was a good feature. The entrance to the bathroom is right next to the bed side which I also found strange. The room layout is old and lacks modernity. The balcony was small with views of Koutoubia and rampart. I would have preferred a better view but it did look good at sunset with the bustle of the traffic and the sound of the local activity breaking out.    This hotel is a dated 5 star which still has an ambience of luxury about it. The hotel had 2 swimming pools. There was one which had a jacuzzi outside it. I often swam in the second pool which was heated. There are plenty of sunbeds and lounging sofas scattered throughout. We did order pool side service once opting for the iced tea and strawberry milkshakes. It was refreshing. We also played a game of table tennis which was pretty good fun.    One of the criticisms of the hotel is that no one at the check in desk made us aware of the facilities on offer. For example we would not have known of the Lawrence bar which we stumbled upon accidentally. We would spend most of our early evenings here for a shisha and pot of mint tea. The atmosphere was relaxing although service was ridiculously slow at times.    We did take a tour of the SO lounge which seemed really good. However it was always dead quiet on the outside area partly because of the weather as it was cold in evenings.    Overally I would definitely recommend this hotel and I would stay here again. Although if I was to compare it to my stay at Es Saadi Palace the luxury factor was a lot higher in the latter.,Date of stay: November 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bournesupreme

My room was booked for a trade fair and my friends had a room booked via Expedia. No problem with my booking but my friends were told their booking had been cancelled by their travel agent - only problem is that I am their agent!!  The situation was very poorly handled and they had to wait 4 hours for their room - after I contacted Expedia.  Wouldn't stay here again - not just because of the problem. The rooms are tired - in need of refurbishment urgently. Staff very nonchalant and arrogant.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Gordon C wrote a review Nov 2016,40,Big resort in a quieter part of Marrakech,First of all Sofitel Marrakech Palais is a big resort conjoined with Sofitel Marrakech Lounge and Spa. The two share facilities. There are hundreds of guest rooms. It's not your typical boutique style Sofitel in an European capital.    The grounds are very well-maintained. The suite I had was spacious and comfortable. I didn't experience any of the maintenance issues described in some previous reviews. During my stay the staff were generally very pleasant and helpful although sometimes it could take awhile to get assistance if they got busy simply because of the sheer number of guests they had to taken care of.    The good:  1. Beautiful hotel ground with several nice swimming pools.  2. Excellent breakfast buffet with nice selection of pastries and fruits.  3. Comfortable bed wand luxurious bathroom.  4. The location is great just far enough from the hustle and bustle in Medina but still within walkable distance of one feel like venturing into the centre in the evening without the need of a taxi.    Not so good:    1. The cashier was a bit funny about currency exchange. The first time I tried he limited the amount I could change to ‚Ç¨100. He grabbed my money and threw some local currency back at me without counting it or explaining to me about exchange rate. The second time was in the evening just before my taxi arrived to take me out to dinner. He obviously had piles of currency in front of him but refused to service me. Instead I was diverted to a currency exchange office 5 minutes down the road.    2. The only place they serve dinner apart from room service is the terrace restaurant. The service was extremely chaotic and slow. It took 30 minutes just to get a glass of wine and put food order in. The food was disappointing too. The lamb tagine arrived lukewarm rather than hot. It was obviously cooked in advance and not warm up properly. The meat and fish parcels selection were hot but sitting in a huge puddle of oil. They didn't even bother to drain them after taking them out of the deep fryer.    3. During the day it can be difficult to get a spot by the pool to sit or relax. Even though the pool area is huge. It's just not big enough to accommodate everyone. I noticed that at about 8.30am straight after breakfast some guests were already setting up by the pools to ensure they get a spot for the day.    Overall I'd still recommend this hotel so long as one has the right expectations.,Date of stay: November 2016,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/794gordonc
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Shakeel J wrote a review Oct 2016,20,Beautiful Hotel...AWFUL Room,The hotel was generally very good... amazing staff and amazing facilities (pool/spa etc.) but our room was not up to standard at all.    We stayed in the opera suite room 410... supposedly the best room type in the hotel. Unfortunately the number and nature of the issues were just not what I would expect from a 5 star hotel.    First and foremost the toilet had an unbearable sewage-like stench coming from it which could be smelt from the hallway it was so bad!  Aside from this we had issues with both showers in the suite as neither had working thermostats and we could not get a comfortable temperature for any reasonable amount of time... very frustrating! We also had other minor issues such as doors which would not close shut a patio door to the balcony which would not lock a jaccuzi bath which didn't work and a plug socket which literally fell off the wall revealing bare electrical wires. I do understand that hotels of a certain age can expect to have a problem or two but there was just so much wrong with our room that it was unacceptable.    To be fair to the hotel they did try to resolve the problem by offering us a new suite (which we could not take as we had just too much to shift amongst other reasons) and they gave us complimentary breakfast after a bit of nudging. The staff and management were excellent. For this reason I give a 2 star overall rating rather than 1 star!  A room in a 5 star hotel from a luxury brand should just NOT be presented in this way.,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,Leicester,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/badshak

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Haddock1910 wrote a review Oct 2016,30,"apart for the pools, not that happy",after having spent the previous few days in the mountains and prior to the the desert in smaller hotels we promised our 5 year old boy a big hotel with big pools for our last day in Morocco. Thus we chose the Sofitel. I saw that it didn't really have the best rating but thought it can't be that bad.    Sadly we were disappointed.    The good stuff:  - the outdoor pool area offers loads of space for hanging around the pool  - the pools are large and one of them is heated  - the pool bar is good and the service is attentive    What we didn't like:  We arrived early roughly around 11:00 and could not yet access our room which of course is no problem at all as we were early. They told us we could access our room after 2 p.m. which we didn't mind as we had all the pool stuff ready. We left the rest of the luggage next to the reception on the trolley. At 15:30 our luggage was still wear we had left it. No one thought about bringing our luggage up to the room which would be expected from a Sofitel.    I requested them to do that and at 16:30 when I wanted to go to my room for the first time with our boy our luggage was still in the lobby. Getting to the room I realized that no sleeping facility had been set up for our boy.    After calling the reception to request them to do that they wanted to charge me an extra EUR 50.00 for an extra bed. I must add that I reserved a Suite one of the smaller ones but a Suite so we would have enough room for our family. Further I reserved a room for 2 adults and 1 5 year old child. Asking extra money for a bed is bad further the amount is ridiculous.    Style and Design is always a personal matter but it simply wasn't authentic enough for our taste.    It was the first time in Marrakech we usually stay at Les Jardins de la Koutoubia. We much prefer this place and we further remain our address of choice in Marrakech.,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Donnacona, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Haddock1910

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Regis H. wrote a review Sep 2016,10,Invest in soundproofing,Ok folks if you are up to all the selfies show off with a massive swimming pool a fantastic building with a lot of marble looking polished stones and an amazing decor this is the place.  The hotel design is fantastic the breakfast abundant with wathever you feel like and there are so many members of staff present at all times everywhere that if you sneeze there will be at least 10 people giving you a tissue.  If you plan to stay in for the night and sleep it's another story. We stayed at the room 375 which happen to be across the street from the infamous sky bar that will play music so loud that even though the windows are closed it feels like the party is in your room. We changed room after a couple of nights to the 93 after complaining of noise which actually happens to be 2 floors below the initial one and the so called sound proof (which is part of the features on some booking websites) is inexistant or very very poor to say the least.  As a result not only we still had the same sky bar crappy music to listen to but the upstairs neighbours as well on the top of things.  So the first night our upstairs neighbour brought a girl at 5h40 in the morning (but the only thing he managed was to sweet talk her and make her laugh a few times) the second night he came back with his mate a little bit after 6 and the third night thank god he only made some noise until 00h30 which was brilliant as it was 20 min after the bar next door stopped tge music. It was monday night though.  We stayed 5 nights and didnt have a single resting night which for 200‚Ç¨ a night in a 5 star hotel is pushing it big time.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveler330406

On arriving it is a very impressive looking hotel however at reception we were told our rooms was not ready. We had arrived early so we were told to come back closer to 3pm. So we went across the road and grabbed some lunch at cafe extrablatt - nice food. We came back and was informed our room was ready but it still took them 45 mins to check us in. Before long one of our group started arguing with one guy at reception I was told he laughed at my friend who replied 'why are you laughing'. Anyway our room was away from everywhere and everyone took 5 mins to get there. Rooms are tired and need updating. Pool areas are nice granted. Food and drink are way over priced in this hotel. For example a pizza by the pool was 3 x more expensive than the cafe across the road.  Also at So club next door you should get complementary entrance however they will try and get you to pay - not good when we spent an equivalent 500 euros on drinks the night before. Top club however.    Was at Atlantis Dubai in August service and experience far better. I will think twice before coming back here again.

We sat in the hotel lobby for around 4 hours.We were eventually  led to our room which was supposed to be a deluxe room .  The room was not worth even a standard room.  The carpets were dirtymattress was not the size for the bed stead being 6 inches shorter.and all lumpy and well past its  Life span.  We rang the hotel desk were put on hold for 15 minutes and  then got cut off.This happened twice.  Eventually we managed to speak to the desk who sent over a maid who could not speak a word of English.  An hour had been wasted so my wife rang the tour operator Dial  A Flight back in England who sorted this out within 10 minutes.  We were upgraded to a junior suite which was more comparable to deluxe rooms we had stayed in other hotels in the past.    The cleaning maids also failed to replace the face flannels a couple of times.  Also on one occasion I asked one of the cleaning maids that  we needed some toilet roll and she replied she would do it later  on.I said a few strong words to her and she brought it around  straight away.  Also the waiters by the bar and the pool were often more busy  talking to each other rather than attending to the hotel guests.    The management need to sort these issues as there were another three times that we experienced different guests in  heated arguments with the management.  This is not expected of. a 4/5 star hotel.    On the positive side the spa and services there were excellent.  and we made the most of our holiday.

I kept fumbling for light switches - many of which did not work. I never got the lanterns next to the bed to work.    The room I was in had not been refurbished. I suppose keeping things uber-dark helps hide the serious wear-and-tear.    The pool is vast and nice.    The breakfast buffet was splendid. I did have dinner and had to send back my chicken tagine - it was dry and something in it had turned. They did not charge me for it and I then ordered a grilled tournedos with foie gras and pepper sauce which was delicious.    The staff at the front desk was not very efficient - even seemed a bit clueless at times.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,ACNM wrote a review Sep 2016,30,4 star hotel with 5 star prices,I had high expectations of this hotel having read the many glowing reviews yet I left feeling I had paid far too much and received too little in return. This is a premium hotel which sits at the top end of the Marrakech price spectrum so I had expected to relax in the height of luxury without a care in the world.    There was an article published recently in which the author outlined how hotel chains are saving money by making subtle reductions that the majority of people would fail to notice. They specifically called out lighting. Keeping a hotel lit is an expensive business therefore large chains have determined that if you reduce room lighting by a certain amount the customer will likely not notice yet the hotel can make substantial savings. The challenge is knowing by how much to reduce this as if you get this wrong then this becomes a problem. Sofitel have got this wrong. I love Marriott hotels yet still have a problem with the darkness of their rooms yet they are positively glowing in comparison to this Sofitel.    We had opted for a junior suite and were 'upgraded' to a pool view junior suite which to me felt like no upgrade at all. The front of the hotel is perfectly nice so why facing the pool versus the front gardens is considered an upgrade I have no idea. In any case the room had a total of 7 lights one ceiling light at the entrance two bedside lights on each side of the bed one desk lamp and one floor lamp yet will all of these turned on and the curtains opened to reveal the balcony I could still hardly see my shoes on the floor. Our week's stay required us to use our mobile phone as a torch whenever we wanted to find anything.    The room in general was quite nice despite the musty smell and the somewhat tired look. As a junior suite we had a Nespresso coffee machine (first 6 capsules free but you could pay extra for each additional one) a desk sofa and flat screen TV. There was also a Bose sound system with 30pin iPhone dock which we were unable to use with either of our newer style phones. The bed was incredibly comfortable though the pillows were very thin so I requested an alternative which was brought to the room but was so much bigger I couldn't use it.    Our room was on the second floor above the hotel bar which I assume stays open until the last person leaves as they were playing music until around 4am. There is also a night club attached to the hotel open to the early hours. We didn't sleep our first night which must have been obvious as we came down to breakfast as we were approached and asked if we were ok. We were asked to let them know if the problem persisted on the second night.    Breakfast is amazing and certainly among the best I have experienced. While many of the larger chains offer a good selection and good service to boot this felt exceptionally good. The juice bar and wide selection of options served personally were great. My only complaint being that many items had no labels so you din't know entirely what you were getting.    The pool area is spit across two main pools and is surrounded by a mixture of built in padded 'beds' normal sun loungers four poster covered 'beds' and hammocks. In the heat of August the pool is wonderful and was never too crowded. We did however have problems ordering ice buckets and would normally need to ask two or free times before we received these. As ice is free we felt that the waiters weren‚Äôt interested. If you fancy a beer or a cocktail or even a soft drink or food these are all available poolside but come with plenty of cash as their prices are dizzyingly high even for hotel standards. The cheap local beer that they serve is around 90c in the local supermarket but expect a bill ten times that for a small can at the hotel. Needless to say we didn‚Äôt buy any alcohol from the hotel.    What we did want to do was use the indoor pool sauna and gym. These are all located in the basement within the spa complex. The spa complex offers a variety of massages and treatments for a price as is almost always the case however I have jet to stay at a hotel of this class where you have to pay for access to the spa area (pool sauna steam room). While the gym is free (and very good) relaxing by the indoor pool or taking a sauna will set you back around $25 each which I felt was was a rip off.    The hotel has a further outdoor pool elevated above the main pools with a wider panoramic view which is awesome ‚Äì however again you have to pay to access this pool at a rate of around $40 per person. Another thing I felt was a rip off.    Our second night was equally as noisy as the first so that on day three we were almost comatose through lack of sleep. We requested a change of room and were provided a new room two floors above our previous one. Equally as dark and sadly a little smaller than our previous one we did at least get some sleep here for the remainder of our stay.    Accepting that there was a lot that we wouldn‚Äôt be able to do at the hotel without paying the exorbitant fees beyond the already high cost of the room aside from breakfast the pool and the gym we spent most of the time out of the hotel complex. On our final full day we had an early morning departure for a 15 hour excursion and headed down to breakfast at 6.30am having confirmed the day before that this was the time breakfast started only to find the dining room shut. Returning to reception we were told that breakfast starts at 7am. How is it we were told differently? Do your staff not know even this basic information about their hotel? And so we left on a 5 hour journey without so much as a coffee.    On our return in the evening I asked to see the manager in order to complain but they were not available. I requested that the manager call to my room when available and I would return to discuss the matter. No call was received. The following morning we were due to check out but I was keen to express my annoyance at having been fobbed off. Again the manager was not available therefore we headed to breakfast with instructions that I would like the manager to introduce herself to me in the restaurant however she again failed to show. Finally locating her in the lobby we did receive an apology an extended checkout and a free taxi to the airport. She also offered to provide us a free poolside lunch at 12.30 which we could finish just before checking out and heading to the airport. 12.30 came and went without any sign of lunch until around 15 minutes later the manager came over to confirm that lunch would be with us shortly. At 1.30 lunch arrived but alas we had a plane to catch so lunch went unfinished with the waiter standing there with a large and delicious looking plate of chilled fresh fruit desert as I explained that we had to leave and she should have been there an hour earlier.    The bottom line then is that this hotel is nice. The pool the breakfast buffet and the gym were excellent. Everything else though was way below par with tired rooms sloppy service and overpriced extras. If this is an example of the Sofitel brand then it‚Äôs not one I would recommend. Would I stay here again? Most probably not but if I did I would certainly take a torch.,Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ACNM

Also this appeared to be a 'party hotel' as there is a bar/night club with loud music playing every night and half naked people walking around so wouldn't recommend for family and respectable type of people.  A shame as Sofitel is a good brand hotel in other parts of the world just not here in Marrakesh!,Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Greater London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/266sunshine
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Zamaan I wrote a review Aug 2016,50,Great hotel made excellent by the staff,My family and I have recently spent time at this hotel. It has everything you'd expect from a 5-star hotel and more. We had two rooms and got a great view of the Atlas Mountains from one and a city view from the other. The pool and sky bar are top quality along with and excellent garden area. However the strength of this hotel is in the hospitality of its staff. All of them spoke enough English that we had no problems getting by. The breakfast staff worked extra hard to make sure we weren't left wanting at any moment. We were fortunate enough to get served by Fatima Rachida Hicham Querfi Azly Ilham Berd and Ritm. They really took care of us every morning. They were excellent at socialising with us and ensured we didn't have any trouble communicating in regards to specific foods. We also had a birthday during our stay and while an issue popped up Jihan quickly and professionally ensured that we'd get a cake on time.  The only cons we had was that the rooms facing the city can hear the music pretty loudly from the Night Lounge.,Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zamaani

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,shafique78 wrote a review Aug 2016,50,Absolutely perfect stay at the Sofitel Marrakech!!!!,We came with a large group of 15 people to the Sofitel Marrakech. The stay was superb as was the location. We spent a lot of out time at the poolside where we were made to feel very welcome all of the time no what what time of day. I must state that if you come with family you should request to be near the poolside or away from the So Lounge club as the music and bass can go on till the early hours of the morning. Regardless the stay was nice. Aziza and team including Nezha Hind and most important the best barman in marrakech Mohammed made our stay pleasurable and could not do enough.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Flip f wrote a review Jul 2016,50,Three nights in Marrakesh,This is a great hotel in a great location. The lobby is the kind of lobby you see on TV commercials. Huge Lobby. Plenty of activity. We arrived from Madrid early in the afternoon. We took a taxi from the airport it's about a ten minute drive from the airport. I paid 200 Dirhams about $20 US. I took the tan colored taxis from the airport. The hotel can arranged a ride from the airport for $30. The taxi I took had no Air Conditioning. Itt was about 105 degrees. But Im in Morocco. The check-in was nice I was offered tea and water at check-in. The hotel has a restaurant and pool and very good air conditioning. The front desk staff was very helpful at check-in. The room was very clean and not noisy. This hotel is huge. There is free water in the rooms. The bathroom very nice. We did not eat at the hotel we took a taxi from the hotel to an area near Jam El Fna We took the taxis outside the hotel gates. Again no air conditioning the same colored taxis at the airport. This hotel is 5 minute drive from JAm el fna about 4 0r 5 dollars. Make sure you negotiate a price before you get in the hotel. I turned down several taxis to get to the one with the right price. We ate at Mabrouk restaurant which is 200 yards from Jam el fna. After eating we went right back to the hotel to wait until night to venture out. The hotel has a night club right next door. There are horse drawn carriages all over the area. Very cheap. we took one back from Jam el fna about 3 dollars. The next time I go to Marrakesh this is the only place I will stay. we did not walk around the area of the hotel because of the heat. There are restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. Really nice area.,Date of stay: July 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Denver, Colorado",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flipf

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,GorgieDrew wrote a review Jul 2016,50,Paradise. Absolute paradise.,"With a lot of hotel reviews you need to take the photos on the review with a pinch of salt. They use professional photographers and fancy lighting which makes everything look perfect and only photograph the best parts of the hotel. With the Sofitel however all the glamorous photos in the review are exactly how the hotel looks. This place is breathtaking.    You drive up to the hotel with lit fountains greeting you and a car park full of Range Rovers Mercedes and BMWs. By the time you get to the front door you've already said ""bonjour"" to more staff then you get in an entire hotel in the UK. Let's not mince words here; this is a very classy place.    The staff in the hotel are impeccable. From the concierge who will help arrange any excusrions to the reception (Zakariah getting an honourable mention) to the restaurant to the pool side (Ava) all the staff had a such a high level of customer service that it's almost impossible to describe it in a single word. And all the staff wear beautifully tailored outfits leaving you in no doubt that this hotel is professional.    The interior and the grounds of the hotel are maintained to the highest standards. All the sun kissed photos you see of the pool are exactly how it looks. Sun beds hammocks and various shelters are dotted round a beautifully landscaped pool area which comprises of the larger busier main pool - or the quieter side pool depending on your mood - and 2 shaded bars when the heat gets too much. Upstairs overlooking the main pool is an infinity pool terraced bar and restaurant - a restaurant which maintains the high level you have now become accustomed to in this oasis.    We'd chosen the basic bedroom - which was still better than most bedrooms you'd get for twice the price in the UK - and there were no complains with it. King size bed with a mattress made of clouds and candyfloss ample sized bathroom which could accommodate a couple getting ready for a night out and a patio door straight on to the poolside.    In summary my girlfriend and I stayed here for a week and could not honestly fault one single thing in the hotel. I very rarely visit the same place twice but we are seriously thinking about going back next year",Date of stay: July 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GorgieDrew

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,41483489 wrote a review Jul 2016,50,Satisfaction,Good eveninghow is everyone today  I will like to shear the wonderful experience have with friends at the sofitel palais imperial hotel in Marrakech  We had 3 rooms the hotel is clean well kept.  The pool is amazing and the rooms are of a good size with a walk in shower.  We stayed here during Ramadan and the place was fairly quiet which meant there was no problem getting sun beds poolside.  The breakfast is amazing with a wonderful spread.  The drinks in the bar are a little expensive but this is usually the same in other 4 and 5 stars resorts.  The hotel is about 10 to 15 minutes from the airport and again the same time into the main medina square.  There's a shopping mall next door which has restaurant and ATMS in it along with a Carrefour for that all important water and snacks top up.    Thanks to all reception staffers  Aida and Ibtissame and the concierge Hicham..

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,matthewbriggs84 wrote a review Jun 2016,40,Charming place well-suited for those requiring a holiday of relaxation.,On first entrance to the lobby in the hotel it certainly had a 'wow' factor with reception members who were very keen to help and assist me during my stay at any moment. The pool was a highlight and was great for us to relax basking in the sun. Set in close proximity to local restaurants it is a great place to stay. Having spend 10 days here it was certainly a worthwhile break with many opportune moments to rest. The men who worked at the pool delivering drinks were all very approachable and keen to meet the needs of the guests. Moreover the Spa was excellent and very relaxing. Perhaps for the hotel to improve the quality of the food left something to be desired with the evening 'A la Carte' menu overpriced and not of the calibre that one would expect. I would strongly suggest guests to eat out as there are some delightful restaurants close by. There were some problems but Ibtissame who worked on the reception was a delight and always presented a positive and enthusiastic demeanor. Hopefully other members of staff can learn to follow suit.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Leeds, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matthewbriggs84

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Stephan A wrote a review Jun 2016,20,Terrible service after booking a pool day pass,My girlfriend and I booked a day pass as we had heard great things about the pool here and wanted a relaxing afternoon. To cut a long story short we paid 800dhs for two day passes (¬£80) which was more than a nights stay in our hotel. We weren't given a receipt and got accused of stealing by a pool attendant who made me walk around for 15 minutes and find the man who sold us our day passes to confirm that we weren't in fact trespassing. I then had to wait over two and a half hours for a bottle of water after asking several waiters and making a complaint to reception. Finally when we came to leave we asked if there was a changing room we could use as we wanted to get changed and showered and head straight to dinner we were again kept waiting for half an hour. I then went back to reception to find out what was going on and they told me that courtesy rooms are only for guests. Only then after I completely lost it did they suggest that we could change in the spa changing rooms. We were really looking forward to visiting the Sofitel but were so disappointed by our awful treatment. I'd say unless you're a guest don't bother. We felt like because we were a young couple who had only bought day passes no one cared about us or took us seriously. They only positive was a young pool attendant called Younes who did his best to look after us after we were initially left waiting over two hours for a bottle of water.,Date of stay: June 2016,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephana647

It is not done in a stand-up desk they invite you to sit in a confortable armchair offer you a fresh towell and a hot mint tea. The desk woman give you a friendly wellcome. Just two signatures and a credit card and its done. The suite is pretty nice well decorated large and comfortable. Maybe a bit dark.  The location of the hotel is perfect just 5 minutes walking distance to the entrance of the Medina. I think that is good place to enjoy Marrakech for foreigners due to the Medina could be a bit stressing. The quarter where is located is plenty of good restaurants and very quite.  The pool area is nice palms and balinesse bed averywhere. Nice towel service and bar and restaurant service like a beach club. Three big pools make a delicious of the kids. Staff are really kindly they know the name of my both sons and where really kind with them. Restaurants and bars are high quality.  Breakfast service are nice continental and all that you could want.

The breakfast looked like a cruise ship buffet it was simply HUGE with very good quality and well presented.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Ellen23456 wrote a review May 2016,30,Lovely on the Outside - Stay in the Updated Rooms on the Spa Side,"I stayed at this majestic looking hotel outside of the Medina (about a 20 minute walk) for five days. I didn't realize it until researching after my stay but the hotel is actually two Sofitel properties in one large complex which until 2008 was listed simply as the Sofitel Marrakech Imperial Hotel and Spa. The decision was made to effectively split the hotel in two creating the Sofitel Marrakech Lounge and Spa marketed as a modern art hotel with spa facilities and the more traditional Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial.    My room was on the Palais Imperial side so if you like ""older"" aka outdated decor dark rooms that are not equipped with enough lighting a toilet situated on the opposite side of the bath/sink room...then this is for you. On the other hand my friend's room was on the Lounge and Spa side and it was a 180degree difference. Large bright white room and decor modern toilet (and bidet) locate in one room with the shower/ sink coffee press...very nice! I felt like I returned to the dungeon after being in my friend's room.    The swimming pools spa and restaurants are available to guests at either property and while there are offcially two separate entrances and reception desks the hotels are linked internally so there is nothing stopping guests of either hotel from entering and leaving as they wish. The buffet breakfast was very nice and substantial and the wait staff was very good. The air freshener that is continuously pumped out of a machine in the hallways and lobby is a bit overpowering so go out and enjoy the lovely poolside patios to get some fresh air.    I likely won't stay here again as there are so many options in Marrakech. Definitely stay on the Spa side if you do make a reservation.

My first time in the city and it did not disappoint!  Hotel is well situated and only a 10min walk to the main would.  Pool and terrace areas are excellent well maintained and clean.  Breakfast is buffett style with a fantastic choice of fresh fruits breads and hot breakfast food items and can be eaten outside on the terrace.  Staff are very friendly and always happy to help.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,U2746ONmarkb wrote a review Apr 2016,40,A great place to stay on a first trip to Marrakech,I spent quite a long time looking at where to stay either near the Medina or at one of the hotels further out of town. I am very glad I chose the Sofitel which is modern but right on the edge of the Medina. So we started off badly as the hotel forgot to pick us up at the airport so we stood around for 15 minutes looking for our car and ended up making our own arrangements. Then told the reception who then completely forgot and still tried to charge us. We then hung around for our 'butler' for our suite. This was irritating we wasted time after a long trip waiting on our 'butler' instead of just checking in right away. The 'butler' thing was a waste of time. We seemed to have to keep him happy as he whisked around the place. Also - buttering appears to be doing some bookings and checking you in and out. Not what I think of as a butler at all. Anyway it did not seem to be his fault just the way things are run. The room was a bit confusing - we thought we booked in the Lounge and Spa wing but our room appeared to be in the other wing. However the Suite was very pleasant with spacious balcony bathroom shower room bedroom and sitting dining room. It was pleasantly and tastefully furnished. Bed was not as comfortable as the usual Sofitel beds for some reason. All was fresh and clean and in good order. Excellent room cleaning staff. Pool side bars and restaurants and breakfast restaurant were all pleasant and the staff were mostly very good. Sometimes when things were more quiet they would chat with their backs turned to customers so it was difficult to attract attention. Food was averagely expensive alcohol it seems everywhere in Marrakech was very expensive. We drank a lot of champagne as it was her birthday trip and that came in at around 170 Euros for a basic bottle of Laurent Perrier normally 80 Euros in a European restaurant. We also tried some local white wines which were fine but not something I would repeat order. Pool side was comfortable and the pool side staff were good. They have one of the pools heated which was great - all the other pools were freezing in early April. Altogether a good stay and a well appointed hotel. On the whole desk staff were not very attentive or bright as I felt the waiting staff were. We had a courtesy room for a late departure. This was a fairly grotty looking room which was not cleaned but at least we had clean towels and a shower before getting dinner and leaving for the airport. Checkout was very drawn out as they were trying to charge me for the non existent airport pickup. I found that the car we did take from the airport was good and we booked him ourselves for some of the local outings to restaurants and the Medina - this was Transport Touristique - a good modern SUV with a good driver who was very prompt and cost effective. Our butler wanted us to take a taxi to the birthday dinner at La Maison Arabe which was ridiculous so we booked ourselves. On average a good experience at Sofitel with the things wrong with it so easily remedied if they sent their front desk staff to other countries.,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Scotland, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U2746ONmarkb

My stay here was fabulous the staff and service was A plus. Everyone would acknowledge you from doorman to reception to waiters pool staff room service. Adeel at reception was extremely helpful as he arranged our excursions. We had a little misunderstanding with the tour guide on first day and I called Adeel and he sorted it out immediately for us. Being a clean freak I can say the hotel was nice and clean breakfast variety was fabulous and staff constantly coming to top up and carry your food for you. Will Defo be returning to Sofitel. We also used the spa facility and had the massage done and I can say it was bliss totally pampered overall I can't fault the hotel for anything everyone has a different experience but mines was great.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Andy1w wrote a review Mar 2016,40,Comfortable but showing age,I stayed one night only while passing through on business.  The hotel is in Hivernage so quite close to the airport but quite a long way from the city centre.  The hotel is large sprawling and rather worn. My room was a long walk down some rather dark corridors. The room itself was quite large and reasonably comfortable and well equipped but quite dark and also in need of a refresh. Fine for a 4-star at an attractive price but not for a 5 star hotel at this price.  Staff were friendly and helpful but a bit slow.  I didn't eat dinner in the hotel and left before breakfast started so had breakfast in the room and this was fine.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled on business,England,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andy1w

The situation in l'Hivernage outside the Medina is very central just 5minutes from the Mamounia for instance. It has a car access.  There are 2 parts: The Sofitel Lounge & Spa (more modern) and The Sofitel Imp√©rial (with Moroccan decoration). Both are confortable not ""waouh"" but ok.  The So beds are very bery confortable as in all Sofitels the wifi works perfectly and the breakfast is really nice and with a huge choice of fruits breads eggs etc.  The best part is obviously the garden and the heated pool (on the Imp√©rial side). The other pool is not heated! Around them you'll find confortable sunbeds and hamacs perfect to relax.  The hammam + Moroccan scrub (500 Dhs/30min) is nicely done but for a better more charming and cheaper treatment the Sultana (in the Medina) is a better option if you have time.",Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled on business,Gen√®ve,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smilysg
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,cadidevile wrote a review Feb 2016,40,Great Hotel with lots to do but one major issue,We stayed for 6 nights and had a great time as the hotel is in a great location and the onsite bars are great. The only issue we had for 4-5 of the nights is the noise from 8am to 11am. I think it may be the people cleaning the rooms but this did impact our sleep. We like to sleep in but we could not because of all the moving and at times shaking of the room. We thought one bad night | morning but it was a daily loud noise for over 3 hours. We were in a jr suite on the 5th floor. The hotel is great and the only reason I would think about it twice is the noise. Most of the staff is friendly and I can see the impact of the other reviews and how the hotel is trying to address them.,Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Athens, Greece",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cadidevile
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,PB0001 wrote a review Feb 2016,30,"Charming building and that's it - Not worth of Sofitel brand, nor a 5-star hotel, forget customer service",Dropped off by an airport taxi at the end of the pond as entrance to the property was gate fenced and guarded by hotel staff; Employees of the hotel simply watched guests pulling the luggage over the pebbled road no one offered to help.    Once up the stairs and inside the lobby someone decided they could help and take the luggage from us - Better late than never but we had already done all the hard work so far both on the pebble road and climbing the stairs...    Checked-in at 8pm and reception was as uninterested as if checking in at an B&B; Not impressed... someone then came by with a tea - finally a first Morocco touch !    Check-in procedures done we were informed to go to our room and luggage would arrive afterwards.    First impression of the building: it is huge much of it on the dark side dimmed lightening kind of worried to amble on those long deserted corridors. Once in the room lightening was as dim as on the corridors; In the room no welcome note no welcome fruit plate nothing for an elite Platinum Accor guest.    Furniture of the room follows an Arabesque style - old and non-renovated style one seems to have gone back in time to an old castle where the landlord decided not to update premises and keep them since the seventies as they were once.    The positive spin of the room was the view but so far not impressed with the whole concept/price. We decided to tour the premises to find the gym and every corridor stairs and parts of the building seemed as deserted and eerie as the first impressions. Going to the gym was an aerobic exercise itself due to the amount of stairs going down and walking through corridors - unsure if I would be able to easily find that same way back.    Then we discovered that while we can use the very small gym with guests using the equipments without charges access to the heated pool incurred an extra cost even for resident guests which was a let down. I am not sure of the exact amount but it was around 30-40 usd per guest.    Later on we found out that swimming on the infinite pool also charges an extra cost of 40 usd for each guest - Thus the two of us in one room would be charged 80 usd to swim for 10-15 minutes... each day ?! Attached you have a photo of the warning.    At this point we pretty much found ourselves in a tourist scam after having paid to be a guest of the hotel - our only entitlement would be the bed and the bathroom.    The next morning after a shower in our room we found out that both towels had definitely seen better days; The bath towels were absolutely old and ragged which would not be ok elsewhere but at an expensive five-star property it was simply carelessness of management. The following days those ragged towels had been replaced by better ones though not fluffy but rather stiff.    The high point of the property was the breakfast in the restaurant due to being included in our rate; Otherwise guests are charged 50 usd/each. Thus if you can get a rate that includes breakfast that will surely be the highest point of the whole stay. Staff at the restaurant seem to be from another property so welcoming and pleasant they are to please and accommodate guests' doubts about food on display and best choices. Quality is fantastic and food is so tasteful that reminds one of really being in Morocco.    Checkout procedures also had incidents as property claimed that breakfast was to be paid to the restaurant despite guest's insisting it was included in the booking. Guest was made to prove with a paper reservation that later on the reception noticed that guest not only was correct but they also had that very document with them. Charges were finally dropped with help of an aggressive senior member but no excuses for the attempt scam were produced. All the experience was uncalled for; If there was a glitch politely excuse yourself do not challenge customer and by being aggressive try to make the erroneous charge to the bill.    By the way this property despite sharing building with the Sofitel Lounge & Spa offers no Executive Lounge for premium guests a facility commonly offered to guests to relax and help themselves for tea/coffee/biscuits throughout the day.    We know five-star properties are about infra-structure and customer service. The later at this property is lagging so behind the minimum received elsewhere at lower level properties that lack of training at employee level is self-evident. I have been more welcome at an Ibis than at this Sofitel. I totally fail to understand how this property may carry the Sofitel brand.    For tourists it might be worth visit the beautiful building after sunset both outside and inside but staying at this property is not worth it - and I do not consider it by any stretch a five-star property; Unless you can have your breakfast included in the rate and you are interested in tasting the best of the Morocco cuisine.,Date of stay: January 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sao Paulo, Brazil",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PB0001

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Stavros P wrote a review Feb 2016,40,"The bed, the location the people","Ok yes I am a Sofitel fan... So another Sofitel review this time on the Palais Imperial. This is really two different hotels joined by the same lobby an older and a newer wing sharing some facilities like reception restaurants spa etc. I stayed in the older wing and the room as such was a bit old but spacious and clean. I was on the first floor overlooking the gardens and the view was not much to talk about but ok overall if you are not looking for top notch. What was really fabulous was the bed. Sofitel raves about their bedding and they also sell them on the Internet. It is good! Very good! A box spring structure with a feather over mattress you feel that you are in heaven when you lay down to sleep! Amenities and extras in the room is all what you would expect in a Sofitel.  Breakfast was generous with various stations offering sweet and savoury I found it to offer a good selection but for a 20USD in Marrakech I would not expect less. keep in mind smoking is widely allowed in Marrakech and if you are sitting outdoors you may find yourself next to a smoker even at breakfast.  Despite a hick up during check in where the hotel staff at first had the wrong reservation for me which took a good 30 mins to sort out I did get an early check in and overall I would commend the staff on being super friendly smiling and willing to help with any detail. You do feel welcome though it can also be a ""Morroccan thing"" these people are very service minded. Gratuities are appreciated but not expected as mandatory.  The hotel is situated in the Hivernage district which is close to the city centre -about 20 mins brisk walk. We did go out to the souk and bought spices overall an experience not to miss if do not mind the hassle noise and chaos of the souk environment.  We did not try the hotel restaurants but being in Hivernage you are spoiled for choice. The concierge was very helpful making reservations at The Comptoir and at the French restaurant at La Mamounia the first Morrokan international and trendy the second classic French both offering good food but then La Mamounia was an overall superb experience with amprice to match ;-)  Taxis are available right outside the hotel ask the concierge on the approximate rate for where you want to go and pay no more -there is no meters used and the drivers will try to get more from you!  A good experience overall and if I would return to Marrakech I would probably stay at the Sofitel again -most probably in the new wing though.",Date of stay: January 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Zurich, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/globetrotterg2013

We ordered 2 burgers mine was way over cooked! the waitress did not ask me how I wanted my burger! we also had skewers and vegetables which were tasteless. Considering the premium price you pay when you eat at the Sofitel this was a very disappointing experience and probably the last visit. I have reviewed the car park as not free as you get harassed by the hotel valet to park your car which you then have to tip. I don't have an issue with tipping but I don't like when they make you use the service and tell you there is no space at the car park to make you use the service.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,April W wrote a review Dec 2015,30,"Just OK for ""luxury hotel"" status",We stayed at this property following a stay at the beautiful Palais Faraj in Fes. When comparing the two they could not be more different.    Sofitel Pros:  Great breakfast  Lots of amenities (for us the pool was the only amenity we found useful)  Great programs for kids (my 4 year old would not let us leave her alone)  Beautifully decorated  SO Lounge for nightlife if that's your interest    Cons:  Loud - it took two calls to security before our neighbors upstairs quieted down  Thin walls - I was sure I could smell smoke in our room from neighbors on balcony  Lacks cultural experience - there are many riads in Marrekesh that offer the beautiful Moroccan architecture.  Rooms facing streets are subjected to motorcycles and yelling - worse than NY hotel rooms!    Tips:  Allow yourself time for check out. I'm used to American hotel check-out where it's rather quick and often can be done from your room. I would highly advise checking out at reception as we were erroneously charged ~$30 for transportation we did not take.    Ask for a room which does NOT face any streets. We were woken up by motorcycles and loud talking.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,JDH50 wrote a review Dec 2015,40,A Hotel that tries hard,Stayed at this Hotel on a number of occasions the most recent during this quiet period before Christmas.  Hotel in general is of a good standard throughout a main large reception area which initially can appear confusing even intimidating to the first time visitor. For those whose natural direction is poor the layout can also be confusing at first however as one afflicted I had worked it out after the first night.  Restaurants and bar seating areas are substantial in size and cater for various tastes. There is various evening entertainment depending on the time of year and this was well received. The pool area is very good and attractive with plenty of quiet areas to hide in.  Our room was as always adequate rather than stunning this includes the suites. No major problems although I would consider some of the furniture to be slightly 'dated'. It is an impossible question apparently to put to the industry in general however if there were more light in the room guests may appreciate the accommodation better!  A point on the Wi-fi: this has greatly improved to a point where it can be said this does now work well.  Staff: always try many times just too hard. They are polite always and pleasant however there are only so many ways you can be asked if 'everything is ok'. When the Hotel has few guests the staff ratio to guests can be overwhelming.  All in all this is a large Hotel that tries very hard to live up to the hyped Sofitel luxury brand. Actually it does a decent enough job at a price which is not cheap nor way over the top. There are many worse Hoteks in this area!,Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled on business,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JDH50

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Caroline Martin wrote a review Nov 2015,50,Beautiful hotel with super service!,My 3 kids and I have just returned from a wonderful 6 night holiday at this lovely hotel. On arrival the staff gave us such a warm welcome making the kids feel very special. The hotel is very beautiful with a really exotic feel. We had a two bedroom suite overlooking the pool which was lovely. The Concierge was such a super chap kindly arranging a private driver to take us to places of interest locally. The pool was fantastic! The kids' club staff are lovely but don't speak english so tricky if you aren't a french speaker. After trying Morrocan food for 3 nights the kids were pining for a spot of pizza which was found at a lovely Italian restaurant a minute's walk away at Del Cafe in the Pearl Hotel. It was my son's 9th birthday during our stay and the hotel staff made it so special for him by bringing a delicious cake at breakfast and singing happy birthday. Without exception the staff in all parts of the hotel were incredibly warm welcoming and professional.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,TheReids wrote a review Oct 2015,20,Enjoy your vacation - book elsewhere,"Very rude condescending staff at the reception desk - the worst welcome we experienced in Morocco in a 3 week driving holiday. Arriving at 1:35 pm I was told coldly to ""sit over there and wait for your room (for 1 1/2 hours!!!!) and that I had no right to complain until after 3 pm when a room should be ready for me"". Nothing in my booking indicated that I had to sit travel weary in the lobby until 3 pm before I could freshen up or change into more appropriate clothes or a swimsuit. Surely not all people checkout at 3pm or that absolutely no rooms are ready until miraculously at 3 pm every room is suddenly ready and absolutely all new guests checking in are then at the same time to be assigned rooms.There were several other disappointed women standing around waiting besides me but no one on the staff deigned to acknowledge this or to attempt to make them feel more comfortable. Definitely not 5 star hotel behaviour that we have ever experienced before.    There were only 2 positives with staff: first was a young man (from a village outside of Tetouan who has retained the good manners he was taught as a boy) who served welcome tea and 2nd was Jahine who interceded to get us into our room once she became aware of my angry face. BTW the room was in fact ready and waiting for a new guest!    Staff throughout the grounds were stressed and snapping at each other while serving lunch (very slowly!) around the pool. Where by the way arriving at the pool we asked for pool towels which never arrived and the storage location was not visible so we could obtain them ourselves. Fortunately we could drip dry from the sun after our brief dip in the freezing cold pool.    Our Luxury Double Room was comfortable but very plain and awkwardly configured much less appealing than any of the Riads we stayed in.    The terrible welcome put a damper on any pleasure we might have had with the opulent setting; we just wanted out of there so we took all our meals and drinks elsewhere.",Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Vancouver, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheReids

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,NeilW933 wrote a review Oct 2015,10,Very Poor Service,Unfortunately I had forgotten I had stayed here before and how poor it was. Here are a few pointers from my recent stay:    I wanted a meal or snack just before I went out to work at 6 pm. I was told to have room service (room service costs an extra 150 MAD or ¬£10) or have food in the reception area but it would take at least 30 mins or if I wanted I could go outside the hotel. It was not the fact that it would take 30 mins ... it was the attitude of the staff.. Take it or leave it !!!    At the same time I noticed that the staff had monkeys on leads on the outside bar area actually on the bar when no guests were around. I had eaten lunch served from the same area earlier.    On the first morning I came down to reception. At the time staff were arguing between themselves and I had to interrupt them to ask where I could get breakfast.    Throughout the stay the staff were rude and unhelpful.    My advice ... Do not stay here.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,sital c wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Hotel stay that trip advisor has seriously under rated,Whilst we love exploring and trying new stuff when it comes to having a great reston holiday;we are quite discerning! When we were planning our trip our prerequisite was a place where we could get our head down and somewhere that had comforts of a good hotel. We saw lots of riads that were really well rated and was quite surprised that Sofitel was so low down in people's views! I cannot agree with that. This is our 2nd day and I feel so passionate about how good it is compared to what I read I had to write about it. We thought took a risk booking it because of trip advisor ratings and yet pleasantly surprised at how friendly the service is it's clean although agree a little dated but doesn't deserve the criticism it's had! Breakfast is probably the best we've had and that's comparing it to le Meriden Dubai the Danna langkawi. It's beautiful though could do with a facelift. It's in a great area right in the middle between old and new town so you have the best of both worlds in hivernege! Restaurants are nearby if you don't want to eat at the hotel restaurant or 15 minutes and you could be in medina. If you want to have the choice to be in or out of the chaos I would say this is great! We found that many of the riads in the old town and medina area are hard to find and down small streets and whilst this adds to the authentic experience if you want a simpler experience Sofitel should not be ruled out just because of the current ratings. We have the best of all worlds where we are and we don't need to stay in the noise or chaos of medina. Riads are beautiful but we found looking for one with a great comfy bed that's not dingey and in a side street that takes an hour to find was tough.

So we decided to eat at there very luxurious buffet which filled our hunger. The food was lovely choices many choices the waiter staff Karim was very welcoming attentive and pleasant to our needs without fault an excellent waiter with good English which made it easier to communicate as we did not speak French or Arabic!    The hotel looked exactly as it does in the photos beautiful inside and outside especially at night : )  my room was comfortable but would have liked to have been escorted to our room considering we waited so long for it. It got a bit confusing when trying to find our room we were tired and did not want to be searching for our room. Our room was very clean and welcoming it was also maintained by housekeeping Aicha a lovely lady who was very pleasant to us throughout our short visit.    The facilities are excellent loved the night club the waiter Mabooss made my birthday night special getting the live band who were brilliant to sing happy birthday to me in front of all who attended on that night. Making me feel very embarrassed but special at the same time : ) I loved it ! we ate dinner stayed for the night club were the Dj Akram played a diverse selection of music partying the night away : )    Our last night we had spa treatment a full body scrub in a steam room which was lovely very refreshing.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Saas888 wrote a review Sep 2015,20,Not worthy of the Sofitel name,I regret that this was easily the worst Sofitel hotel we have visited and as an Accor gold member I have experience of quite a few.    The check-in was poor and no welcome drink was offered. Our initial suite was next to a noisy road with no view (an Atlas view was booked). After complaining we were eventually upgraded to a Palace suite but a this should have been done automatically with Accor club gold status.    The overall service level was appalling. Many staff are poorly trained and have no interest in serving guests. On one occasion we walked from the pool to the main reception and saw a total of eleven staff talking to each other and not helping guests. Staff at the pool were the worst. No towels were offered vacant sun beds were not cleared of dirty towels and the hotel policy of allowing outside guests to use the pools made it difficult to find sun beds.    Ordering drinks in any bar was an endurance test with waiting times of 20-40 minutes before a simple glass of wine arrived.    The main a la carte restaurant was closed with only a fraction of the menu available in the alternative restaurant.    The concierge failed to efficiently organise a guide for us to the old town and could not answer basic questions about Marrakech..    On the plus side food service at the Oasis poolside restaurant was efficient as was breakfast.    I asked to see a senior manager to complain but was told that there was no one available. No member of the management team subsequently tried to contact me.    This poor state of affairs is the responsibility of management who need to improve standards so that the hotel is worthy of the Sofitel name. Perhaps the management team should visit the Sofitel at Essaouira where service and other standards are excellent.,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saas888

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,essySpeyside wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Fantastic ! Has the Wow factor!,From our arrival at Marrakesh airport the hotel collected us in a super comfortable Mercedes -to our departure a couple of days later we were so thoroughly spoiled and pampered! We had a gorgeous suite and Mustapha the butler appointed to take care of us was worth his weight in gold. He did so much for us helping with onward transfers which the next Sofitel had messed up. He anticipated our every need and we felt we were making a mistake spending only a couple of days and going to a resort on the coast!  The one thing we didn't enjoy was our evening meal in the restaurant. We did enjoy lunch by the pool though. Yes food and drinks are very pricey but its a very glamorous and VERY well run hotel.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,yasmin_richardson wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Incredible hotel in a beautiful country,We stayed at Sofitel for 3 nights at the end of August.    Prior to our departure we had arranged for a hotel taxi to meet us at the airport. This process was very straightforward we arrived slightly ahead of schedule but our driver was already waiting with a Sofitel board to take us to the hotel. The hotel taxi may be slightly more expensive than a regular taxi but I would definitely recommend paying the extra.    We knew the hotel was lovely hence booking it but we were blown away when we arrived. The hotel is very impressive!  After being greeted and told to take a seat and enjoy our welcome drink we were informed that our room wasn't quite ready yet but that we would be upgraded to a Prestige Suite free of charge!    Our hotel room was beautifully decorated very spacious and had all the mod cons you would expect from a 5* hotel and more. The bed was huge and so comfortable that it was hard to leave in the mornings!    We found the prices of food and drinks to be very reasonable contrary to some of the reviews we had seen on TripAdvisor before travel. Prices were no more expensive than you would pay in a nice restaurant in London perhaps even cheaper! We found the food to be very enjoyable and portion sizes to be good. Would recommend the burgers they're heavenly!    We ordered room service on more than one occasion our hotel room was just too good to leave! Our food always arrived quickly was served with a smile and tasted delicious.    Staff were very friendly and couldn't do enough for you.  As part of our room upgrade we had a housekeeper come in every evening to prepare the room for turn down. This involved the curtains being drawn the pillows being arranged slippers at the side of the bed a bottle of water and a class being placed on each bedside table and the breakfast menu laid on top of the bed. We found this to be a lovely touch it made the experience more personable.    The hotel gardens were well maintained and very beautiful. Fresh flowers were found throughout the hotels communal areas and candles lit in the lobby of an evening which made it feel very homely. They also have some sort of fragranced air freshener which makes the hotel smell heavenly!    We had a wonderful time here our only complaint was that we couldn't stay longer! If we were to return to Marrakech we wouldn't hestitate to return to this hotel nor would we hestitate to recommend to friends and family.

Have been a regular client of sofitel Marrakech for years but really have to say have been truly disappointed by the quality of the food which has become really appalling. And totally overpriced : for example 40 eur for a very average risotto with 3 shrimps. It seems the management does not care as most of the clientele is local and values other elements of the hotel such as the garden and location. At a minimum of 300 eur per night (closer to 400eur for high season) they are now far better options around such as the four seasons.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,michelle g wrote a review Aug 2015,20,A big disappointment,Facilities are pleasant. we enjoyed the 3 swimming pools and had lunch every day by the pool . Food and staff are ok though over priced . Rooms were tiny and frankly quite old  the corridors look also poor maintained for a Sofitel. However the worst of all was the guests staying at the time at the hotel. Please avoided take your kids teenagers or parents there.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,thomsondoha wrote a review Aug 2015,50,"Location, Hospitality, Morrocan Hospitality",Having travelled extensively all over the world I only write reviews of hotels when are extremely good or extremely bad and this hotel is extremely good and is worth mentioning to my fellow travelers. The hotel has several positive elements a great location is one of them as it is only a 5 minute drive from Marrakech Train station and the commercial centre of Marrakech and it is also nicely nested between the casino as ES Eaadi Palace Hotel on the left hand side and the Grand Mosque Square a five minute walk to the right hand side of the hotel you may also walk out of the hotel walk across the round about in front of the hotel and you will find several amazing cafes and restaurants to chose from comptoir is an experience on its own with a great atmosphere belly dancers and great live music. you may also want to experience Jad Mahal Restaurant located within 2 minute walk from the hotel at the first right turn outside the hotel.    Having very little expectation from the hotel I soon experienced the customer centric approach of the staff and management of the hotel and was highly impressed by their quick action whenever I had a request and its all thanks to Mr. Soufienne the guest relations manager and his team who will most definitely take your customer experience requirements very seriously Mr. Soufienne an amazing hotelier and a highly articulate individual who is a great pleasure to deal with is always there looking after the hotel guests try to find him and say hello great insight into Morocco and Moroccan life was shared by him during one of the conversations we had over a cup of mint tea. A special mention also to the wonderful house keeping ladies who are so hard working caring and sweet they event brought me extra water one day when I did not feel well due to the heat.    Now it cant be all perfect right? room service can be improved as it can be a bit slow especially at night an order may take up to an hour and a half to show up in your room. and Taxi drivers are annoying and will approach you outside the hotel to the level of harassment they over charge massively walk away from the hotel before you stop a cab and you will get a much better price the average I paid for a short trip was 50 Derhams and it should be 10 or 20 but no chance you will be over charged.    Places to visit: Oreka in the Atlas Mountains wow my best experience in years beautiful green mountains hills and farmland with amazing waterfalls and small farmers communities plenty of places to eat the most authentic Moroccan Tagines cooked to perfection on charcoals as amazingly cheap prices please do go to oreka I hired a private driver for the day in an air-conditioned car and it only cost me 150 Dollars if you take a car from your hotel the price will be at least 250 Dollars but if you are sharing well worth taking the hotel car. Oreka impressed me so much I went back several times you will want to live there... you also need to visit Jamea Al Fana Square during the day and at night time and take some amazing photographs there are however lots of hustlers and people who will try to make you part with your money be careful pickpocketing is rife there keep your head on and enjoy the snake charmers are a pest and can be annoying they event flung a freaking cobra on my shoulder while not looking and busy taking photographs I lost the power of my legs for a few seconds and nearly passed out and then they had the nerve to ask me for Backsheesh (tip).. Another place that is worth seeing is Assoueira an old port town and a great place to go to the beach and see markets and the old medina shopping is great there and so is fish tagines they are famous for it this place is a two and a half hour drive from Marrakech and again you can hire a driver with a private car or hire a car yourself and drive there easy to get to.    if you have time then a couple of Days in the seaside city of Agadir is advised what a party town. great views and loads of good clubs and bars speaking of which in Marrakech you may enjoy several clubs 555 Tiatro (right next to the Sofitel) and So located within the Sofitel Hotel.    one of my favorite experiences is sitting at the Garden restaurant at the front of the hotel and within its ground and smoking shisha and drinking Moroccan tea with great music being played there is always a DJ great lighting and atmosphere and lovely staff always did that before I went out on the town. for those of you who want to do something good take some presents cloths sweets foods books and visit the Marrakech orphanage the girls and boys there are amazing and longing for some love and attention is an experience like no other and highly rewarding.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Jovialtaurus wrote a review Jul 2015,20,"Anything but ""manifique""",On a whim I decided to spend the weekend in Marrakech and ended up booking at the Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial. The hotel is conveniently located within a short taxi ride from the Medina and Gueliz. Whilst the Sofitel has potential it is let down terribly by complacent management and aloof staff members who virtually acknowledge no guests in passing.    The public areas and the guest rooms look worn and neglected. Room Service trolleys with dirty dishes idle for hours in the guest hallways. Ordering a cold beer at the Pool Lounge requires getting up twice to obtain the attention of the staff members nearby who were engaged in socializing among themselves.    Offerings at the breakfast buffet are adequate yet the joy of a leisurely breakfast is inhibited by staff members who could care less about guests. Chefs and Waiters can be observed sitting on couches inside the restaurant chatting and playing with their mobile phones. An order for an egg white omelette was met with a sigh and rolling eyes. A humble request for more hot water was met with a sneer.    There are plenty of choices in regards to comfortable and enjoyable accommodation in Marrakech.

I asked if we could check in and we waited 30 more minutes. We arrived to our room where we had 2 twin beds though we paid for 1 King. You won't notice the difference they said. I think I would notice my husband in a different bed on the other side of the room from me.

Paid 400dirhams each for standard guest pool access 500dirhams for luxury guest pool access.  Go for standard until they clean the infinity pool!!  Have to disagree with others re pool staffing comments staff in both areas were fantastic both days! Couldn't do enough to help especially today in luxury!  However there ends the positives.    Infinity Pool today was dirty stones / debris on the pool floor green mildew where the wall meets the floor and the water smelt foul. Might be imagining it but ears are already starting to hurt hope to god the water's not given me an ear infection.  Young girl yesterday said they are learning re luxury area and would appreciate comments big comment from me is clean the infinity pool!!    Food and drinks good both days but crazy Sofitel prices.    Looking round the whole hotel needs a spruce up. Dead plants hanging off the walls bird poop everywhere and dirty stains down the walls.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,genyit wrote a review Apr 2015,40,"Very comfortable, very charming hotel in Hivernage",The Sofitel Marrakech Palais in Marrakech is somewhat of an oasis just outside the medina (just a 5 minute walk) in the Hivernage neighborhood. The classic decor has many Moroccan features with a french influence. My king bed room overlooked the pool area with a view of the High Atlas Mountains (off in the distance). My third floor room was comfortable had a small balcony with chairs and table and a modern marble-tiled bathroom. My one complaint about the room was that it was quite a walk from the main lobby. My room rate included the breakfast buffet which featured the usual breakfast fare and traditional Moroccan items. I found the service to be attentive helpful and polite. Most of the hotel staff are fluent in English French and Arabic. There were several decent restaurant options (Moroccan Italian Thai etc.) within a short walk from the hotel. There were no concerns about walking out and back to the local restaurants at night. The area immediately outside the hotel has several hotels restaurants a casino and upscale apartment buildings.

The hotel itself is in a great location. If you are looking for a really nice hotel with a great pool to relax this has it it is also a perfect distance from the main town for wandering in.    As mentioned though the service is appalling. The pool staff do not get you drinks or if they take your order will forget. The restaurant staff ignore you the bar staff will just walk past you the reception staff will refuse to help and housekeeping do not bring towels    Even the simplest things are a challenge for example I am an Accor member and have stayed in Sofitel's around the world normally all my points are credited to my account. However despite asking them 3 times to ensure I was credited they managed to loose my member details each time still to this day I am waiting for this to be resolved as they didn't invoice me correctly.

I paid the single supplement and was assigned a room all to myself. The good news stopped here. My room faced the pool and garden. The view was beautiful. But the minute i walked in i could smell a stench or foul odor near the entry of the room. I thought if i open the window and turn the fan on high the odor would go away It did not. My tour director and i requested to change a room but there was no room available. I requested a room change the next morning again and was promised by the front desk night staff and day staff. So i packed up so they can move me while i went on the day tour. I was disappointed to find that the request was not entered into the computer. After 20 minutes talking to the staff in no vail . I threatened to sleep in the lobby. The stench was so strong even my tour director and the bellhop thought it was really bad . The manager came out and upgraded me to a junior suite. This was an accommodation they could have offer me the first night. The view was not as nice but i was fine with any room at that point as i was exhausted. The total time spent with the front desk was over 1 hour and i was extremely frustrated. By the time i finished the move i was late to join the group for dinner. The staff was nice and courteous but inefficient and incompetent. ( they later told me that they found the request with a wrong room number entered. )  This is a 5 star hotel with a 3 star operation. Hopefully the odor in room is cleaned up.  We stayed three nights. But my first two days were ruined by their incompetency.

The location is great it's about 10 mins walk to reach that famous big market 10 minutes taxi to their biggest mall and about 15 mins taxi to other famous attraction.    But then    1. I got the upgraded room the one that have a balcony facing the mount atlas when i got to the room i found (lots of) birds poo on the balcony's floor. i can't even listen the guy talking about how beautiful that mountain is all i can think about is lots of disinfectant and a mop to clear out that mess    2. The upgraded room i got surprisingly didn't provide a single toothbrush so i asked on from the room service our room was located at the 5th floor near the house keeping room and i assume 15 mins is enough to deliver the toothbrush. But i'm wrong call them again after 30 mins and wait for 30 mins more yet no toothbrush appeared. I went and knocked on the housekeeping room no answer (surprise surprise) then i go down to the reception and the not so helping receptionist (read detail on point number 3) is just telling us to wait they made a few call after i said ""i'll wait here until i got my toothbrush"" then the toothbrush drama ends    3. Most of the staff  specially the receptionists and won't consider you a human being unless you speak french. They'll talk to other french speaking customer WHILE you're not done with them or sometimes answering a phone call WITHOUT saying sorry to you WHILE you're not done talking (if this a local culture here then ignore this point)    4. The breakfast doesn't have enough option for a International Hotel there are four section and 3 of them are just sweets cake more sweet more cake and more sweet pastries. You can't even find any single bacon come on! breakfast? without bacon? (lol) but seriously you need to work on that breakfast menu not everyone can eat only sweets in the morning    5. The most terrible part is on the last nigh of my stay the aircon on my room broke down called the room service in 15 mins. a technician come (if i know this i'll call the technician to bring me toothbrush lot of faster lol) after 10 mins of cleaning the aircon the technician done with his work. I realized after 20 mins that the room is still hot as hell then i called them again and they say they'll send another technician that didn't appear after 20mins waiting so i went down AGAIN  The only explanation they have is ""the whole building having the same problem"" but yet i feel cold in the reception area (nice work at lying there gal!) so i said ok then i'll sleep in your lobby then!  Now they change their answer that ""the problem is at the 5th floor"" (getting clever honey but not working for me your building your problem not mine)    After i said i have a morning flight to catch and didn't have time for this right now they offer us another room at 3rd or 4th floor i forget and that room's ac is FINE (eat that problem is in the whole building reason!)    So yeah! i guess the hotel's staff loves you so much that every single request you made requires you to go down to the receptionist and talk to them off course if you speak french they'll respect you more too bad i'm just Indonesian that barely speak english.    once again i'll repeat my title WORST.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Cath H wrote a review Apr 2015,50,A Perfect Paradise,Myself and 3 girlfriends have just come back from a 3 night stay for my 40th birthday. All I can say is WOW!! Fantastic hotel!!  The staff (especially Sofia the manager) were exceptional.  The location is perfect (a 10-15 min walk to the medina) or merely step outside the door for a taxi!!  It is sumptuous welcoming and beautiful.  I could not have had a better stay. So thank you!! Try the VIP upstairs pool lounge for a day of sunbathing and pure decadence!!  Few tips on restaurants - Le Marrakchi in Jemaa el Fna Square (overlooking the square) and La Mamounia Moroccan restaurant (950 or 750 dirham fixed price menu. Expensive but the food & service were exceptional)  The hop on hop off bus outside the hotel is great! Only 145 dirhams for 24 hours.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Fabrice N wrote a review Apr 2015,20,SO disappointing!,Third stay at this hotel. But disappointing experience this time around.    The negative experience started when I checked in. Although I specifically asked for a non-smoking room I was given a smoking one. Given that all rooms in that aisle had a garden access apparently all the rooms on that side were evidently for smokers. Which I only realized when after asking several times to get a new room I was moved to another room again for smokers!    Then a day later  I left a cup of coffee on a bed table before leaving the room at twelve. The cup was still there while my bed had been done.    I found the staff quite unresponsive as evidenced by the following:    - you're passing by three members of the staff chatting by a door and none of them hold the door for you  - it took me four calls and 60 minutes to get two bottles of water that had been replaced when the room was made earlier.    Compared to the first two stays I found a lower level of service quality. I'm not sure that I will go back there.,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Libreville, Gabon",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FabriceN634
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,egamkatz wrote a review Apr 2015,30,It's the little things... :(,"My husband and I went to Morocco to celebrate my 35ht birthday. When we first got there we were totally excited! The Lobby is beautiful and grand! The people that worked there seemed super welcoming. We got to our room #430 and it was ok. The Decor was kinda outdated. Then i used the toilet and thats when i started having second thoughts. The toilet is in its own room separate from the sink and the shower. The toilet room smelled like urine. I thought maybe they haven't used this room in a few days maybe the stink will go away we were there 3 nights and the smell never went away. I always made sure i wore my slippers because i was afraid maybe it was the floor that smelled not sure. We had Dinner in one of their restaurants and it was lovely the steaks were tasty. We had lunch buffet down stairs by the pool. The first time i went in to the buffet area i was in awe. The presentation was great! However coming from America i was quickly discouraged by the selection of food since nothing seemed familiar. So i decided to fill myself by eating from their wide selection of desserts which were all pretty tasty. I enjoyed eating there so much that we went there again for lunch the 2nd day. The 2nd day was not so good. The sun was out after it had been raining since we got there and i thought it would be great if we could get a table under the sun. When i told the hosts they put us in a nice table under the sun. However we were moved immediately as the supervisor told the host that the tables were reserved. So they moved us to the patio area where the sun did not hit and we were freezing. I asked the supervisor 2 more times to move us and the options he gave us were either eating inside or moving to a table closer to the heater and that they could turn it on for us. However i never enjoyed my meal because i was so focused on wanting to sit in a better spot. Afterwards they brought our bill and i looked at it for the 1st time and it was 1045 DH which is about 105 $ dollars for a buffet for 2 plus 2 drinks!!! Oh i was upset!!! So we are paying 105$ for a lunch buffet and they can't please us with a a simple request to move us to a a table under the sun?!?! And to top it off the table the supervisor had said was reserved was never occupied the whole time we were there. So we decided that that would be our last time eating at the hotel and we decided to eat in a nice italian restaurant by the mosque in the medina where we spent 35 $ dollars in lunch for 2!! The last day we were there which was the 4th day i called concierge to ask for more shampoo. (Mind you we are not in America where you can easily find a CVS Walgreens or in England where you can find a local Boots so you highly depend on the toiletries in the hotel) It took them about 20 minutes to bring me 3 little bottles of what i thought was shampoo and they left. I was about to hop in the shower when i read the bottles and realized they had brought me 3 bottles of body gel!!! I called again i told them the situation and i even told them i could run downstairs and get it myself and they said ""no no we will take it"" I waited 40 minutes!! I got tired of waiting and ended up using the body gel to wash my hair! They never came with the shampoo!! Another thing that i think is strange is that i felt some guests in the lobby got more attention than others and i don't know how that is determined. Anyway that's my list of troubles. Oh and Another thing that was difficult is the language barrier. Most employees only speak french and arabic. I know i might sound like a fuzzy guest but this hotel is considered a 5 star hotel and the service was not 5 stars!! I LOVED Morocco and I will probably go back but I will NEVER stay at the sofitel there again!! I'm sure there are plenty of other hotels that will welcome our stay much better.",Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/egamkatz
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,seafood17 wrote a review Apr 2015,40,Great views of the Atlas Mountains !,We enjoyed our recent stay at this 5 star hotel. We were met with a welcoming fresh mint tea while we checked in. Our room was a junior suite which was a good size with ample space. Excellent view from our balcony overlooking the pool and directly ahead were the snow peaked Atlas Mountains. Very comfortable bed all facilities you would expect from a 5 star property (coffee machine luxury toiletries bathrobe and slippers). Wifi would cut out so hot√®l should improve this. Breakfast was good a little chaotic at busy times. Service was a bit slow; there appeared to be a lot of staff walking around yet not doing much. They would walk past our table clearly see empty plates waiting to be cleared but they needed prompting to clear them. The only truly attentive person was the Restaurant Manager we presumed he was the Manager as he would walk by the tables greet customers and clear plates where necessary; he was very much 'on the ball'. The Waitering staff at breakfast need to be proactive. Reception staff were always readily available to answer any queries or make recommendations on local restaurants.  The outdoor pool area was well kept and clean and comfortable sun beds. Didn't stay long enough to try out any treatments at the Spa. Overall an enjoyable stay at this hotel !,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seafood17
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Moontarin_Ansar wrote a review Apr 2015,50,An oasis of calm in a central location,We were here for 4 nights on a short break. The staff were friendly and attentive. The hotel looks beautiful. Our original room was above average. However one day the air-conditioning unit started making a loud noise at 4am hence we were moved to a suite within 30 mins to allow us to pack which we were not expecting. However the suite was stunning with a sitting room and dining area with balcony near the garden overlooking the pool.    The buffet breakfast was better than other 5 star places I have experienced and special mention has to be given to Mr Abdellatif Bennouby the Food Services and Restauraariety nt Director for the enitire hotel who noticed us on the first day as we looked a bit bewildered at the sheer size of the breakfast lounge extending outdoors. He showed us round the breakfast bar explain the variety of world foods. Everyday he was extremely helpful and to him everything was a pleasure. As a gesture of goodwill he even sent us up a lovely basket of fruit one day.    The hotel was nice but it was the staff that made it special.    We bought a sim card INWI for 150 DHM ¬£11 at the airport and then for a further 150 dirham used this to tether. The hotel helped top it up as everything with in Arabic/French with the telecom company. There is a Carefour Supermarket and many restaurants within a 30 -60 dirham taxi ride. The poolside area is nice and has areas of privacy. The rooms are a little dark but this helps to keep them cool with the window tints.    Caution is needed as taxi drivers will try and charge you three times the fare the best tip is find the price and mention you did the trip the day before at the same time of day. The cost to airport is 70-100 dhirhams depending on time of day.,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Dundee,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Moontarin_Ansar

Breakfast was once again the perfect start to the day with so many choices along with fresh fruit juices that were delivered to our table each morning along with our omelettes. The service from the staff here is second to none. We would like to say a special thank you to Mustapha who greeted us every morning with a smile and an effortless service.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Lesley B wrote a review Mar 2015,40,"Warm welcome, lovely hotel",We chose this hotel because of its location near the start/finish of the Marrakech marathon. The welcome was warm with hot towels and traditional Morrocan mint tea. We booked a Junior Suite with view of the Atlas Mountains. It was a lovely room very well appointed and the view was stunning. Free wifi included.    The pools and gardens were well maintained. Day time temperature in early February was 22C and the outdoor heated swimming pool was perfect. Lunch and drinks from the L'Oasis pool bar and restaurant was good value with a wide choice on the menu. Service was excellent.    We ate supper at L'Orangerie and So Good Lounge both in the hotel. Both restaurants were excellent food well prepared and delicious. We chose local dishes and were not disappointed. The hotel restaurants are a bit pricey but still very enjoyable. We did find the entertainment in the So Good Lounge rather mediocre and left before the show finished.    Overall this is a beautiful hotel set in lush gardens with a good food and beverage service.

Nothing was too much trouble; the food was excellent both at the wonderful breakfast buffet and in the Orangerie restaurant. Although the weather was not hot nevertheless a couple of days by the pool also was greatly enjoyable with attentive but unobtrusive staff. The hotel is in a quiet area just down from the Nouvelle Ville but also in easy reach of the old town so has the best of both worlds. The Spa complex in the hotel was also luxurious and included a gym and small swimming pool as well more traditional Hammam steam room and massage treatments etc. staff there were also friendly and appropriately courteous.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Jo D wrote a review Feb 2015,40,"A palace, indeed","This luxury hotel is located in the ""Hivernage"" area of Marrakech's new quarter but is not far from the Medina (old quarter.) It is a palatial building with a classic Moroccan look. The entrance has a deep portico with seating the lobby has a section for enjoying the Moroccan mint tea ritual (which can be made there for you by one of the staff.) The pool and gardens are gorgeous and most rooms have a good view of the Atlas Mountains (those that do not face the street on one side.)    The restaurants are very good--there is a full service restaurant for breakfast and lunch a club for dinner and a poolside bistro. I tried the bistro and enjoyed a delicious sandwich and the breakfast lunch and room service left nothing to be desired.    My room however was a bit dingy and dark. The carpet could have used a cleaning and the bed was very uncomfortable. I had to have the feather pad on the mattress removed (allergy to feathers) and so I had a blanket on the bed but nothing underneath and no suggestion to the staff could remedy sleeping on what was essentially like a box spring. It hurt to sleep on it and others of my party remarked their bed was lumpy.    The lighting even when every lamp was lit was still too dim to light the room sufficiently.    There was a pleasant small balcony with small table and two chairs for coffee sipping while looking at the mountains. The room is supplied with an AEG A Modo Mio espresso capsule machine and you get six complimentary capsules; additional will cost you 44 dirhams apiece. Sugar was not replenished during my week but capsules were.    Other than my carpet the hotel room bathroom and common areas were spotlessly clean and the staff was attentive (except for the bed issue) and kind.    Food by the way had plenty of choices for anyone who is vegetarian. Exceptional food even if you don't eat meat-- even on the room service menu there were choices that were vegetable based and really good.    I enjoyed my stay. Would I stay again?

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,ChrisABeaune wrote a review Feb 2015,50,Excellent,Our room with a little jasmine-covered veranda overlooked the pool complex utterly delightful. The hotel's public spaces are splendid particularly the dining room with breakfast buffet. What a buffet - extensive and gorgeously presented even during the hoards descending on it during a golf tournament. Staff was very attentive.  Dinner was very French and very good: an amuse-bouche of celeriac smoked salmon and caviar set the taste for a terrine of roasted vegetables and then rack of lamb with creme brulee for dessert. A very expensive wine list.  It is worth spending time to explore the grounds with all the art and outdoor-living spaces. Truly a hotel for the senses.

I wandered onto the balcony to check the view ( front of hotel in a corner opposite The Pearl)....almost locked myself out of the room as I closed the door thankfully quickly noticed no handle on the outside????....phew a near miss. Decided to take a bath to wash away cares of the day prior to evening out bath quickly filled sadly the water started to pour away almost as quickly when I immersed myself....a problem with the plug which I asked the front desk to deal with as I departed for the evening (I had assumed it had been dealt with until the next time I had a bath & found the answer was to keep a heel firmly on top of the plug) After lovely evening at Le Comptoir I was looking forward to a good nights sleep in what looked like a very comfortable bed I turned down the sheets and for those of a faint disposition I shall spare you the details (but photo can be provided :) suffice to say it was more than evident that it was not 'Goldilocks' that had been sleeping there possibly 'Daddy Bear' and the sheets hadn't been changed :( Call to reception meant Housekeeping duly arrived to strip the bed short wait for new bedding but this did mean not being able to attempt sleep until almost an hour later then planned (I am old & need as much Beauty sleep as possible) So tired slept soundly but it would have been nice to have received some kind of acknowledgement the next day ( a little note of apology?) from Housekeeping or Customer Service for the inconvenience caused especially as I hadn't made a fuss or demanded another room. Unfortunately the next night I obviously wasn't tired enough as I was woken at 3 a.m. to the sounds of the exuberant guests leaving the nightclub directly opposite the Hotel and the revs of vehicle engines. As I was now wide awake I decided to use Internet but possibly because I was some distance from reception this was rather intermittent so attempted to read a book but it was then I discovered the light above bed was missing :( The other thing I would like to mention that surprised me was the charge of 250dhs for guests to use the indoor pool during the winter season this may be the only opportunity for guests to swim.  The Good: In an attempt to balance this review the staff at the Hotel are lovely and the Management should be very proud of the work they do special mention must go to Hassan who worked on the Breakfast station on the Terrace of Le Jardin & Hassan who managed this area delightful & excellent customer service! Also the food choice available was wonderful & delicious.  Not Ugly: The public areas of this hotel are superb smells wonderful excellent Artwork & comfortable beds around the outdoor pools. As well as 'Le Jardin' the 'So' Restaurant is a great place to eat outside on a warm evening.  Prior to this last minute trip I had already booked a holiday to stay in the 'Lounge & Spa' in June so 'I will be back' but I shall be checking the beds lights etc. as soon as I arrive in the room :),Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,East Sussex,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tillie12gardner

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Obayed1 wrote a review Feb 2015,50,Splendid customer service,Too many names to mention but had an awesome stay at the hotel.    Was not very happy at the room which was allocated but didn't really mind. On the first day walking to the pool I met a chap called Abdul Rahman he generally spoke to me in kindness and asked if my room was okay I told him it's okay but as soon as I said but he made sure I was moved to a fantastic room. All this was done through Abdul Rahman and his colleague Jihane who were fantastic all throughout the stay.    There was also a young lady at so lounge not sure of her name but she was awesome and helpful all throughout the stay.    The only slight issue I'd say was on Monday when I went for a swim but the heated swimming pool was just not warm enough I asked many waiters weather they could turn it up they advised they will check with management but never did get back to us till we were about to leave about an hour later advising they cannot turn up,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Obayed1

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Trelawney F wrote a review Jan 2015,40,Five Days in January,We arrived at dusk on the Monday. J had been here the previous October. A and I liked the look smell and feel of the place immediately. Outside the birds were making a ruckus as hundreds of them fought for their roosting perches among the greenery climbing up the back of the hotel. We found the majority of the staff - especially Taoufik the foyer porter who looked after our bags and hailed taxis throughout our stay polite and attentive. Though as another reviewer has noted service by waiters could be erratic. Each day at least one of our orders for tea or beers went AWOL and we would have to repeat our requests. The traditional night with belly dancers in the hotel night club was a little disappointing. The dancers were elegant and bewitching. We paid the set fee up front only then to discover no drinks were included and the price of a small bottle of Casablanca beer was 100 Dirhams. So if we had been inclined that way it would have cost the equivalent of virtually ¬£100 for just one of us to get merry. But excellent service from the staff compensated for this. We took only one other evening meal at the hotel our night of arrival. I asked for a carafe of the house wine. However there was no house wine. We were pointed to a bottle of red Moroccan priced at 800+ Dirhams. We appreciate hotels are run to make a profit but this level of mark-up is excessive.,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrelawneyF
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,ALAMI44 wrote a review Jan 2015,40,Good but not as good as it was few years back,I have been a very loyal customer of Sofitel for the last 8 years since we are from Casablanca it's only two hours away. Unfortunately in the last years we notice the standards of the hotel went down a bit it become a bit noisy especially around the swimming pool area( summer time and vacations). I don't know why they let people from outside the hotel to acces the swimming pool (100 or 200 Dh I don't remember how much) .around the pool some people are very disrespectful :playing loud music with the stereos  shouting and fighting.  Other than this I have to say that the rooms are nice the breakfast is one of the best in Marrakech the swimming pool area is fantastic (when there is no gangsters around). Service also changed a lot before people were saying hello and smile much more than now. Actually service depends on people people like butlers mostafa and imad are very professional and do the best they can others you really don't understand what are the doing there.,Date of stay: January 2015,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ALAMI44
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,youke_worldwide wrote a review Jan 2015,30,Luxurious but forgettable,On entering the hotel one is struck by how luxurious the hotel lobby is. There are two lobbies and the decor is completely different. There is nice art and we could feel we were in a five star hotel. Breakfast was a lot of food for what seemed like hardly any guests. Big pool area and large deck chairs but it was too cold to laze around the pool. It just lacked atmosphere - I could be in any luxurious hotel in any part of the world and it didn't feel special for the history and culture that is present in Marrakech.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Tommy S wrote a review Jan 2015,20,The most inconsiderate general management for a 5 star hotel on 5 continents,We are seasoned world travelers and highly acustomed to 5 star and luxury hotels. Our last experience at the Sofitel Marrakech was the worst experience with hotel management ever. I would like to single out the Hotel General Manager Mr. Benkirane. We have tried to talk to him for 8 days regarding issues we were having with our stay at the hotel. We were never able to!!!! He and His staff kept on lying and giving excuses including calling us at 10:30 at night to schedule an appointment that never materialized.    A 400 euro a night hotel management should be a bit more attentive to client needs. Let me start with the room we reserved a suite to find out it is just a room to be exact 40 square meters with a Bathroom that has not been renovated since perhaps the 90's and water temperature that can not be maintained so the water can run hot and cold when you least expect it. The sink faucet water never got very hot. You have to turn the shower on first then the faucet for water to get hot. The carpet had spots and was not even vacuumed some days. The sliding door to the balcony did not close luckily we were on a high floor so risks were limited.    The furniture was cheap and absolutely not fit fir a 5 star 400 euro a night a hotel. The only advantage is the location close to the Medina and the spa whose staff was friendly.    We were utterly disappointed with the attitude of the management and their incompetence at simple things like check out. The Accord group needs to give its general manager at this hotel a lesson on being amire considerate to its customers. I actually just chose another hotel other than the sofitel for a business meeting for a large group.  I do not recommend the Sofitel Marrakech. You can choose many others with much better service.

After touring the chaotic Medina the hotel which is in walking distance serves as a relaxing oasis. We were traveling with a 5 year old and took advantage of the hotel kids club. Two points regarding the kids club... make certain there is a staff member that speaks your child's language and do not let your child attend the disco without ear plugs - - they do not consider the sensitive hearing of children when blasting the music! Regarding the spa I had a very mediocre massage (could have been the language barrier but I would not waste your money) My wife did not find her experience in the spa any better.

The morning buffet/brunch is wonderful. All kinds of pastries crepes fresh juices smoothies fruits cheeses and the chefs make eggs to order on the spot. The restaurant is a bit formal but we ate very well and our servers were friendly and sweet. It was too cold outside to use the pools but they looked very inviting. Our rooms were spacious and well appointed with a beautiful view of the High Atlas mountains from the balcony.    My only complaint is that there is an overwhelming smell of jasmine (at least I think that's what it was) in this hotel. I don't know if they pump it through the vents or what but It was pretty overpowering every time we walked in the lobby and in the rooms. As a result I wound up with an epic headache a few times - the headache would subside when I left the hotel but start back up again as soon as I came back in.

After a bit of a wait we realized that nothing was happening so we approached the deskwe had seen other guests being taken care of where they were seated but not us.A charming desk clerk named Amina handled our registration.I mentioned that I had upgraded the room to Mountain View with Expedia.es I was given the key to the room and off we went.On entering the room which was beautiful we saw that it was not a Mountain View I returned to the desk to complain.  Amina looked up the reservation and said that was the room that was in the systemshe then contacted the person who deals with Expedia bookings and was informed that the hotel never received the request for the upgrade!!!! Anyway our room was changed to a Mountain View in fact I think it was an even bigger upgrade as we had a corner room on the fourth floor with a huge terrace and a view to the Medina and the Mountains! The hotel was very luxurious and had all the amenities that one could possibly wish having said that we felt the Front Desk service was not up to par for a five star hotel. There were a lot of staff constantly milling around behind the desk but it appears that each one had a specific job.My husband wished for some change and he stood for ages waiting for someone to acknowledge himbut no one did and finally he spoke up and was told the the person that takes care of that had left for a moment! A little more organization would help also trainingwe were informed that the Darkum Palais would open at 8:00am for coffee and pastries but that was not sowe needed to get a early start for a tour. There is no excuse for mis-information!

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,PDA68 wrote a review Nov 2014,40,Very good hotel and location to visit Marrakech,We chose this hotel in the Hivernage quarter to have some quiet after visiting the medina and it was a good choice. Check in was fast we arrived early in the morning at 10 AM. We we're offered some tea and after a 5 min. wait our paperwork was done. Our room wasn't ready until afternoon. Luggage was taken care of but as some already wrote the luggage stays in sight of everyone. So when the hotel called our room was ready we asked for the luggage to be taken to the room which was done. The room with view of the gardens was very far from everything. You had to take at least 3 hallways to reach it. Room was good but not perfect. Lamps above the bed where not working and they we're never fixed although we mentioned it by phone. Room was quiet dark and the view of the garden was a corner of it. So the extra pay wasn't worth it as we found. We had another stay at the end of our trip in Marrakech and booked a room in the sofitel lounge and spa which had a garden and pool room with excellent views and near everything. The difference is the interior of the room. The rooms in the palace are rather more Maroccon style.  The restaurants are serving both sofitel palace and lounge and spa. So no mather in which wing you stay you eat in the same restaurants and use the same pools. Breakfast was super! Everything you can think of and a real holiday treat. We ate 2 in the Orangerie and it was excellent too.,Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Adinkerke, Belgium",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PDA68

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,GaryD03 wrote a review Oct 2014,40,Nice Hotel but beware when you go out,We travel a lot and I must say we were very happy with the hotel. Service was excellent anything we requested was dealt with very quickly. The food is good and served by very helpful staff. Read the stuff about the pool when we got back late afternoon we always got a sun bed the pool staff are really accommodating and always find somewhere and are on hand with towels. Rooms clean and serviced by mid day. No complaints at all.    However we asked the hotel to call us a taxi to go to visit the Synagogue in Mellah. We were quoted 40 dirhams. Taxi driver offered to stay and wait and we agreed 100 dirhams. The first stop was a carpet shop the second stop a pharmacy who tried to sell us Moroccan Oil third stop another carpet shop who tried to convince us it was a Synagogue. We may be British but not stupid he then told us the Synagogue was closed at which point after an argument we forced him to take us back to the hotel. Not a hotel car so not there fault but they need to make sure the taxi company they use are honest.    If you are a photographer the going rate to take a picture in the Souk is either 900 dirhams or you buy in the shop. These guys are very aggressive and hassle you all the time. If you don't buy they chase you and tell you not to take pictures.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,IowaTraveler50021 wrote a review Oct 2014,30,Mixed feelings,Background upfront....we were two moms traveling with her college-aged son and his classmate after they had studied abroad.  The good: the hotel is picturesque especially the lobby and grounds. The pool is a must do in the hot desert heat. The breakfast was very nice with many western and local foods. The beds are very comfortable. While it is a walk you can walk to the medina and save on cab fair.  The bad: the hotel is in need of an update. The bathrooms are small and there were never enough towels. The walls are paper thin especially by the desk!!?? It's like the person in the next room was sitting by me as I could hear everything through the outlets. The air conditioning does not cool the room enough. The elevators were slow and didn't work at times....not fun when you're on the 4th floor and it's July.  The ugly: the service is not what I'd expect from a Sofitel. Having stayed in Sofitels across the world this was an exception. It was slow and lazy....never an inch more than what was necessary. Examples....check in was 30 minutes. Yes we had tea which helped but not for 30 minutes! Breakfast.. For three days every morning I had to ask for every refill on juice coffee and water. When the boys were with us service was better. When they were not....WE WERE INVISIBLE. In 6 hours at the pool we never had someone come take a drink or food order. We motioned sought help directly from the attendants and the bar. I expected women to not be treated the same on their own in Morocco when we were in town but thought it'd be different at this western hotel.  I did share this with Sofitel on my return and they were very apologetic. That doesn't change our trip though.,Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Ankeny, Iowa",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IowaTraveler50021

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Sabah A wrote a review Sep 2014,20,"Disgrace to the brand ""Sofitel""",Ok where do I begin from...  1. Check - in took 20 mins oh and guess what we were the only ones in queue. They kept telling us please relax and take a seat and we wanted to take our room and feed my 9 montn old.    2. House Keeping Service: We pre requested for a microwave (which until my checkout didnt arrive) and an electric kettle which after calling the reception 3 times and then shouting at them to deliver asap as I didnt have warm water to feed my son it finally arrived 2hrs after our request. Oh and the cherry on top was when I opened the kettle it was filled with burned calcium and some weird oil. I called millions of times but now they just didnt pick up. I had to personally go down literally shout at the team leader threatening him that I wouldnt pay him unless I have a kettle. He finally moved his butt and got me a proper clean one. Worse part was my son had diarrhea and I need to give him warm water ors frequently. I was warming the bottle in the hotel toilet by running it under warm water to feed him!!! Worst experience of my life!    3. Main Reception: First staff is extremely not welcoming. If you ask them something they look at each other and the query goes from one to the next. It was endless. Better figure it out yourself.    I gave 2 points simply to room service who delivered our food warm and in lesser time than they promised. And to Yousuf the waiter who works in the restaurant that serves mainly breakfast and lunch. He was very warm welcoming and great at his work. Thank you Yousuf!    All of this team leader apologised and waived the breakfast charge for one person MAD 250DH.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Jamesey1973 wrote a review Sep 2014,40,A little bit of luxury...,We booked this hotel through Kuoni in the UK and got a pretty good deal (we thought) Then we arrived and realised we had got an excellent deal! A lovely hotel and amazing breakfast (many thanks to the breakfast crew Hicham Fatima Rachida Nezha Berd Azlimand and Abderrahim who made hotel breakfast much more than just food). The hotel itself is very relaxed the pools are amazing with lots of loungers and beds to relax on and there is a superb spa with hammam and sauna where I had one of the best massages ever...if you're going to Marrakech for a few days and want somewhere convenient for the medina as well as the new town you could do a lot worse than here.,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jamesey1973

I can highly recommend it from the moment we entered we knew we had made the right decision. The hotel is very well situated and access to all areas is excellent. The room we had was beautiful and the bed was fantastic so comfortable with the air conditioning in the room a must. The staffs attention to detail was excellent in all areas of the hotel. We had dinner most days by the hotel pool and the food was very good.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,D A C wrote a review Aug 2014,20,"Good hotel, but poor service let it down",A lovely hotel in an excellent location within walking distance of the old town and the bustling market square and souks. The spa is also fab with a lovely quiet pool area the best pedicure I've had for a while. Tried all of the restaurants and all served great food particularly the traditional Moroccan restaurant where both the food and service were excellent. What let this hotel down was the extremely poor service at breakfast and around the pool. I think that quite a few of the reviews for this hotel are fake - staff have no interest in serving you at breakfast you have to ask repeatedly for tea/coffee and cutlery/crockery the only thing that is done efficiently is the clearing of tables. A lot of the waiting staff in the pool area stand around talking to each other (except when a manager appears) and ignore you or walk away when you call them to order food etc. My husband went and asked one of them for a menu one day and they directed him to the outdoor restaurant area. My teenage children went to the pool on their own one day and asked repeatedly for towels and were ignored eventually a man on the next door lounger intervened and towels were provided. Twice we arrived back from a day sight seeing (around 15:00) and were told that there were no towels left! All in all fab food fab location but EXTREMELY poor service around the pool and at breakfast. I should mention that there was one afternoon when the service was what you would expect - as a group of men in suits moved around the pool area obviously inspecting and discussing the hotel. A great shame that they weren't there for the entire week!,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dac249

Unfortunately the fact of it is that when I am travelling I need to be able to stay connected for both personal and business. The wifi at the Sofitel is bad and I mean really bad to the point at which it is unusable 9-5. It seems to be a capacity issue so easily fixed by management spending some $$.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,LatLong125W wrote a review Aug 2014,40,A lovely Oasis,My husband and I stayed here for several nights upon our arrival in Morocco at the end of April beginning of May.  It is a spacious hotel with a large courtyard and 2 lovely pools. The courtyard is surrounded by beautiful Bougainvillea‚Äôs cascading off the balconies and lots of pool chairs. It truly is a wonderful way to relax after your day of exploring.  The rooms are a little bit older but they where doing some upgrades while we where there.  We found the staff at the pool and the restaurants very attentive which made our stay most memorable. It is very close to the airport and the famous Medina of Marrakesh. It‚Äôs close enough that you can catch a horse drawn carriage to take you there!  The staff at the hotel were extremely helpful with all our plans and arranged the most excellent guide to take us through the Medina!

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Derek_Lorraine wrote a review Aug 2014,30,Five star hotel but................,"Stayed in quite a few sofitels around the world but I'm sorry to say this one isn't their best.  The arrival check in the hotel and the rooms where all fine and we were made very welcome.The location is excellent just a 15 min walk to the Marrakech square.  I feel that for a five star hotel it lacked in service quality and attentiveness. For the prices the hotel demands the service should be better.  It's wrong that I always felt I was chasing them to get served anywhere in the complex.  A meal in their special Sol Resteraunt was a disaster from arrival to main course was just short of two hours ( 50 minutes between the end of starter before the main). Numerous requests to find out were the food was spotted the chef and asked him to sort. It then arrived and was cold and bland lots of apologises from three individual managers but no actual action except join us for a drink tomorrow! Reported this to the reception and received yet another apology.  Requested a drink at the pool after a day trip! Not a big request but the staff forgot and I end up chasing for service to get a beer. From initial request to actually get the beer was 20 minutes.  A visit to the reception bar was not a lot better I actually walked to the staff requested a drink and demonstrated where I was seated. I left 15 minutes later still thirsty without the drink.  Maybe I should have a drink from the mini bar I did three days ago and I'm still awaiting a refill.  A visit through reception to inform them of the problems resulted in another apology and a brief meeting with the customer relations manager she again apologised on behalf of the hotel.  You must also be aware of the ""special Atlas mountain trip"". A very expensive drive to the mountains and a vist to an inferior souvenir shop a visit to a ""real"" Berber village who will sell you argon oil at inflated prices. The drive then proceeds up to the special waterfall. The car parks and then the walk begins. We are a reasonably fit couple in our 50's shod in sandals and flip flops and where requested to make a kilometre climb that seriously a mountain goat would have struggled with. Not a path but actually climbing! My wife was unable to proceed and had to wait at the half way point I succeeded in finishing but it really wasn't worth the effortit most certainly wasn't what was being sold. On our return it was commented on by the customer relations manager that we should have worn trainers if we'd known then we may have reevaluated the trip! You tend to trust the concierge in a hotel of this quality.  As for the pool area which had a nice ambience had problems. I thought I was passed leaving towels out before breakfast! If a bed wasn't reserved before 9.00 then forget it. It was all the more frustrating to see so many beds unoccupied for such long periods during the day. Guest arriving mid afternoon to claim their spot. Surely the management need to step in to stop this abuse. Maybe a two hour window that if a bed was not used for this period it was passed on to other clients of the hotel. There were occasions when towels were unavailable for guests at 4.00pm. Surely not something that should happen at a five star hotel.  Overall I enjoyed my break here at the sofitel in marrakech it such a pity that they let themselves and the hotel down too often. Five star prices should be reflected with five star service.",Date of stay: August 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Derek_Lorraine
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,vickyandsteve wrote a review Jul 2014,40,A lovely place to stay...but not to eat,Don't get me wrong. The hotel is beautiful It was nice and quiet and the two pools were great.By the way- I would strongly suggest you get a hotel with a pool in Marrakech if you are staying more than a few days. But unfortunately the food for what it was was just way too expensive. On the plus side and if you don't mind a 20 minute walk the square is good value for money and an eye opener to say the least.  Mine and my Mum's personal opinion is that there isn't a lot to do in Marrakech. I would suggest no more that a week tops! We really enjoyed going to the Atlas mountains and waterfalls but if you do fancy it take trainers or appropriate shoes. we went in flip flops and was very challenging and it was almost like going rock climbing. ( my Mum is 60 and loved it and was so happy she did it )  The people in Marrakech really are lovely if a little pushy in the shops. But that's all part of the experience you expect there  Just go enjoy the experience culture and foodbut outside of the hotel!!,Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vickyandsteve
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,North Yorkshire Traveller wrote a review Jul 2014,10,Overpriced,I came here twice to use the pool as my Riad has no pool.    We had drinks by the pool the first time and although the water was 45 dirham and a glass of wine was 90 dirham I didn't mind so much as they let us use their nice pool. Chips were 50 dirham and pizza was 150dirham. Way overpriced for Marrakech even.    2nd time was a disaster. We walked 3-4km in 40c heat and when we got there we were told it was 400 dirham each to use the pool. I repeat - 400 dirham each. That's 80‚Ç¨ for two people to use a pool. Disgraceful. Then we said we would be having lunch so why not let us in to use the pool. They then said 700 dirham for pool and lunch. Each.    We said no then walked over to the Novotel who charged only 200 dirham.,Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"North Yorkshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NYorksTravel
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Bliksimstrale wrote a review Jul 2014,40,"Excellent hotel, average Spa",Hi there. Thanks for reading my review. We spent 4 nights at this hotel and it was comfortable clean and tidy. Its a very traditional looking hotel with a nice outside area that includes a pool and plenty of sun loungers and couches. The finishings in the rooms is not to 5* standard and the feel of luxury is not quite achieved.    We did book a few spa treatments. They advertised that they could give us all a manicure and pedicure together outside by the pool and we booked it like that. We didn't however get what we asked for and neither did we get couples massages. We got individual massages and ended up spending the afternoon separately. We were celebrating my wife's 30th and thought that we would spend the day together but they management at the spa had other ideas!    I did leave a complaint with the spa management and they have been very apologetic and offered us a free 1 hour treatment each when we visit them again. The weird thing is they charged us 500MAD for a taxi to the hotel from the airport and 600MAD for the return.    So all and all a very good hotel with excellent service. Off course there were a few hick-ups but not anything that would put me off staying there again.

The hotel is just beautiful but it is a luxury hotel in which the details are very important. Some areas are being restored and there is no care to covering these areas from guests. We reserved a king bed room and we received double beds the tv was not working as well as the safety lock. Room was beautiful as well as the area. Walking 10 min from the old city Medina.

From the moment we walked through the hotel door we were treated like royalty. It was lovely to be greeted by every member of staff. Our room was spacious clean and overlooked the pool area with a backdrop of the mountains. It also overlooked the construction site but this did not disturb us in any way. However the pigeons on the balcony were a bit of a nuisance. Our beds were the most comfy of any 5 star hotel we have stayed in before. The Concierge was very helpful and checking in and out was a breeze. We thoroughly enjoyed the breakfasts and were always impressed with the service we received. We were also looked after very well at the pool. Hassan and his team were very polite and friendly Abdelilah was always smiling and happy to help. Whenever we had a request we were always told ‚Äúno problem‚Äù and there never was a problem. The team in So club looked after us every evening too. Zakaria and his team get a special mention as they made sure there was a table for us whether we wanted to sit inside or out on the terrace. They were very polite and nothing was too much for them despite our cheeky requests. The evening entertainment/band playing can however get a bit repetitive for hotel guests as they play the same cover songs every evening!    We really got a 5 star treatment so many thanks to all at Sofitel.    This hotel is in a great location we felt very safe walking around during the day & evening.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,AlsterHamburg wrote a review Jun 2014,20,Not a luxury hotel,upon arrival our driver had to carry the luggage out of the car up the stairs to the hotel and then the porter came to carry next to the reception. Now the procedure for check in was starting. 2 desks and 4 ladies were working behind. I was the only (!!!) guest waiting for the check in. Nobody was caring about me. After 5 minutes of waiting time I have asked one lady if she is able to care about us and our check in. Then she asked for passports and for the credit card. The room was already paid in advance. We should sit down in the lounge. 5 minutes later a lady came and wanted us to fill in the form for staying in the hotel. Before I wanted to do it I have asked to get back our passports before because I did know that her colleague has already made a print of it. Then we got back the passport but not the credit card! She has forgotten to print and to charge it (!!!) because you need to pay an additional deposit of 1000 Dirham per day (about 100 ‚Ç¨ !!!). So she returned to make this print and charge! Then it took another 5 minutes to get the keycard for our room. In the meantime we have got some tea and of course the qualified lady knocked down the tea which was poured over the form...  Then we walked with our keycards for the room trough almost dark floors in the ground floor to the lift and have entered the wrong lift. Of course the porter who was walking behind us and not ahead of us told us that we are in the wrong lift (elevator). So after a while we could enter the room and were very surprised that there was not a luxury furniture or decoration or interiour design. Even the materials are cheap! A little bit of luxury impression you can see at the lobby ground floor. There was no information about the hotel facilities or phone number in the room. The breakfast was poor and the staff prefered to play with children of the guest or to talk with colleagues. So we needed to wait 10 minutes before a waiter has seen us and felt able to ask for our wishes. The choice of marmelade jam or cold cuts was poor.When one man behind a breakfast bar has cut a slice of salmon he took it with his naked hand wearing no gloves to put it on my plate. This is the best example for perfect hygiene and you will have a good chance to become ill! In the bar at evening or night it was empty. The drinks are very expensive and of course you will get only little bit of alcohol. Although in the bar there were no other guest we needed to wait a long time for our bill. The reason was simple. The waitress has forgotte us. She has prefered to talk with a colleague at the bar..As a result I cannot recommend this hotel. The value for money is poor!,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Cannes, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlsterHamburg
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,MatthewCF33 wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Great Experience - Highly Recommended,This was my first trip to Morocco so coming in I had no frame of reference. However traveling straight from Nice France (and based on previous international trips) I assumed the hotel would be comparable to the basic European hotels I was used to. I was pleasantly surprised as it was much nicer than expected and especially for the very reasonable rate I paid for the room. The amenities compare favorably to a nicer US hotel however with the charm of Marrakech. The service was exceptional the pool area lovely and the restaurants superb. This was truly a resort and was nice to spend time there when not exploring the Medina and other activities in Marrakech. The only issue I had was a slight online booking/billing issue but when I arrived Hanane BOUGUETTA the Reservation Manager was able to quickly and effiiciently resolve the problem to my satisfaction -- she was great (along with all the other staff).

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,SWCSW14 wrote a review May 2014,30,A let down,"Having stayed in the medina at the start of our trip we wanted a more generic hotel for the end of our trip in order to relax by the pool and not a lot else. We wanted to be looked after so we booked one of the largest suites in the Palais Imperial part of the hotel which was a fantastic room with excellent housekeeping and an absolutely brilliant bed.    The hotel does lots of things well (as you would expect from a luxury hotel) but is let down in a few areas:    1- breakfast could be a heap better for 250dh per person. I'd expect their standard of breakfast to be included in the room rate - it was a good breakfast but I've certainly had better without the hefty price tag first thing every morning (it sort of starts the day badly to pay that much for a tea and some fruit if you don't want to stuff yourself with eggs). The service at breakfast was also quite shambolic with too many staff meaning that actually things got overlooked with each thinking the others would probably be sorting things out. Make a bit of a fuss and you get looked after but it shouldn't require that.    2- the hotel seems to be aiming for a hip crowd with its SOlounge swimming in decorative magnums of Laurent Perrier and grey goose but the bar has 5 cocktails and asking for a straight vodka martini got blank looks and a ""no sorry these are our cocktails"". It can't be hard to employ someone with experience of making cocktails and would surely be a wise investment. Maybe we are spoiled in London but my local pub has a better selection for half the price.    3- the smultzy entertainment in the bars (think bad Buble and Adelle cover band). I'd prefer no entertainment and in fact they interrupted a relatively good dj to perform a live cover set which was so bad we left!    4- some of the staff around the pool give the impression they think they are too cool to do their jobs well. Ask for something and it will get done but sometimes without any words/niceties at all - not even a ""yes of course"" or ""here you are"" or even some eye contact or acknowledgement that you have spoken just a sort of brusque attempt to look nonchalant which isn't really cool to anyone over about 16 years old and definitely isn't 5* service. It didn't bother us a great deal but enough to point it out.    Generally if you've stayed at top hotels in European cities you may feel that the place is a little bit ""white Bentley"" if you get my drift... Possibly this is sustainable/a good business model for Marrakech but be aware before you book. If you are expecting it (even if it isn't your thing) you will probably have a fine and relaxing time here.    One more thing - if considering this as your only hotel in Marrakech then yes it will give you the safety and comfort of a 5* chain hotel but I'd urge you to consider something in the medina as well because you really could be anywhere at this place. Also worth noting that the pools are one wall away from a busy main road which was unexpected but not disastrous- the birds and poolside music mostly drowned out any traffic noise.",Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Richmond-upon-Thames, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SWCSW14
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Arani wrote a review May 2014,50,Luxury stay!,This was our first trip to Marrakech and the Sofitel hotel and staff made it a great time! We spent 6 nights last week in May. The hotel was beautiful we were greeted with mint tea at check in and also upgraded to the prestige suite which looks even better in real life than the pictures- it was huge! And had a balcony overlooking the pool with its own table and sofa where we had breakfast a couple of times. The hotel is within comfortable walking distance from the souks and the koutoubia so we for the most part avoided using taxis at all.    The staff were all so friendly and helpful and service was excellent all over the hotel. They helped us organise a camel ride in the desert which was good fun. The food was also excellent and there was a good selection at the main restaurant and the So Lounge too. Actually we had a great friday night at the So Lounge club it was busy the live band were really talented and so much fun and the atmosphere was just great for a good party! And open till 6am!    The spa was beautifully decorated and has a nice quiet heated swimming pool that you can use after treatments. It made for a very relaxing morning! The outside pools are huge as well- freezing cold though!    There is some construction work going on at the far end of the hotel near the restaurant but this didn't affect our stay at all.    All in all this was a fabulous trip and this hotel was in a great location so well maintained and with such friendly staff it made it just perfect! We would definitely come and stay again!,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/araniu

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Mikko T wrote a review Apr 2014,20,Not even close to 5 stars,The property itself is relatively nice especially the pool area.  Elevators in the hotel are slow. We stayed in a junior suite facing the main entrance and it was spacious but a little worn out. Unfortunately the service at the hotel is horrible! You order a mojito and you get a pina colada. You order a burger and 40 mins later when you ask for it you are told that they forgot about it. Room service was ok but the food was cold when it arrived (burger pizza and caesar salad).    Being a platinum member with Accor we didn't get any benefits. No upgrade no newspaper delivered to the room no gift no late check-out before the very last moment..Also Marrakech is pretty warm and all we got in our room was two small bottles of water per day.    I hope to find an alternative hotel in Marrakech for my future stays. There's a Suite Novotel accross the street.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,jrchannon wrote a review Apr 2014,20,"Pool Day - good service by the pool, poor in the restaurant","We paid for a day's ""pool pass"" and ate lunch here. My partner had regularly stayed at the hotel before (on four previous occasions) and wanted to spend a day by the pool as our Riad did not have one. The hotel was undergoing some construction work close to the pool but this did not interfere with our experience. We were well attended to by the pool for drinks but our experience at the pool side restaurant for lunch was not good and spoilt the visit slightly. We were offered a table by the pool. Although the restaurant was well staffed and not particularly busy the table was not cleared of the dirty plates and cutlery for 10 minutes as our waiter was busy arguing with the manager (which continued sporadically during our visit). Having spoken to the manager we were sent over another waitress who cleared the table and took our order. This was not the end of our problems unfortunately. I was delivered the wrong dish this was taken away and I was left with my side orders of french fries and vegetables. A replacement did not appear for over 20 minutes and only on request. By which time my side orders were cold. The mayo requested to go with the chips never appeared. When we had finished and paid we were then chased for a missing bit of paper at the pool an hour later. We did not have this as everything was left at the table. The food was average by the standards of all the restaurants we ate at during our stay in Marrakech but expensive.    We were offered no apology for all the failings in service and I am therefore unable to recommend this restaurant to anyone. Sad because we enjoyed our day as a whole and paid for the privilege of spending the day by the hotel pool.",Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Poole, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jrchannon
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Alastair G wrote a review Apr 2014,40,Almost perfect,As in so many instances the service provided by the staff can make or marr a holiday. In this case the service was almost faultless. One over-enthusiastic waiter removed our teapot and half full cups while we were at the buffet selecting the next course of our breakfast! While on the catering staff Fatimah is a delight and is always ready to go the extra mile to help. In the Orangerie both the serving staff and the wine waiter were extremely knowledgable and helpful. Vassime in charge of the poolside catering had his attention drawn to an anomaly in the pricing structure where a dish of roasted vegetables served as a started and the exact same vegetables with the addition of three strips of wafer thin cheese differed in price by almost ¬£10 making it the most expensive cheese on the planet! He realised immediately that something was wrong in the system and reduced our bill so that the two dishes were billed the same. Being of the opinion that problems are not problems it's how they are handled which can be a problem Vassime scored full marks for his handling of the situation. Along the same lines there was an issue with one of the bedside lights and within five minutes of calling to report it two electricians appeared and had it fixed almost immediately. The breakfasts are expensive if you opt for the restaurant version but you have the option of ordering what you want by the poolside which works out at a fraction of the cost. The location is ideal near enough the old town to have the Jemaa el Fna an easy ten minute walk away but sufficiently removed to feel that you can escape the crowds if need be. We would recommend checking your bill on departure even if the taxi has just arrived. We didn't and found out later that the hotel had charged for items from the room's mini bar which were not used. Overall a great place to stay if visiting Marrakech.  One last tip when you leave the hotel to walk to the city you might well be approached by someone who claims to work at your hotel (they probably wait to see which hotel you have just left). They don't! He will offer to guide you to the centre of town but you could easily end up in his uncle's carpet shop.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,NatalieNK wrote a review Apr 2014,30,Not a 5* - but some shinning stars within..,After reading through reviews now having stayed at the hotel - I understand what others are saying - it is branded a 5* with 3* service.    Upon arrival neither myself or my partner was offered even a glass of water or towel to freshen up even though all the other guests around us had we were left waiting for 20mins to have anybody even remember we were waiting to check in.    After an appalling check in and several room changes (listed below) and yelling at the front of house manager things did get better....    Room 1 - Ground floor next to the kids suite - screaming children from arrival and balcony door not locking - did not comfortable at all on the ground floor requested room change - was first lied to and told the hotel was at max capacity and this would not be possible - then spoke to another member of staff who sent a somebody to collect our bags - we had to wait 30-45 mins for this to happen and had to call reception again to remind them.  Provided a free drink - which we never took up on as compensation for our problems.    Room 2 - higher floor with a view of a fully grown olive tree even though we had paid for a garden/pool view - did not expect the garden on my balcony; requested another room.  At this point it had been 2 hours and all we wanted to do was change and go enjoy the sunshine by the pool - after asking for a room the change we were provided one in the Sofitel Lounge & Spa hotel next door.    Room 3 - Finally hoping this would be it we walked into the room to have two beds and not one as per our reservation - by this point 4 hours later and being awake for over 12 hours I was totally fed up and ready to check out. I was offered a lunch by the pool for free which was for was not satisfactory at all the lady was rude and couldn't care less and informed me she would call the manager - instead of wasting my time he could have been called prior to the several room changes to resolve the matter at the earliest opportunity.    Nevertheless the manager did have another complaint to deal with which had myself and my partner waiting for another 20 mins by 6pm the manager had to deal with the yelling and me taking it out on him. He was very understanding and apologized and did the best that he could do with the situation. He made the effort where others wouldn't and did continue throughout our holiday to check up on us. He deserve recognition for all his hard work.    The pool butlers decide who they want to reserve beds for - I reserved a bed and came back after 2 hours to find it had been occupied with my magazines missing. The next day the same bed was pre-reserved with my magazines for over 5 hours with nobody turning up to take it. The pool butler decided to argue with me and then report back to his manager whom I had not even taken the issue up with as I didn't want it to ruin my day.    The manager decided to come over to my table at breakfast outside in front of other guests and argue - this same manager had ignored myself and my partner for every other morning but decided to approach my table to discuss the matter. I explained my experience the day before and asked him to leave as before 9 am (not even having my breakfast) I do not wish to argue over contradicting matters. Nobody turned up to dispute me using their bed being taken which I was on nor the three next to me - they were left empty all day instead until late afternoon when it was obvious nobody was taking them.  Other pool problems - waiting over 30/40mins for one bottle of water and waiting over 45min for food to arrive ‚Äì usually cold.    I must agree with other reviews on T.A and warn other guests if you are not able to speak French you will more than likely receive a poor service within this hotel - and guests do come second to the locals which is a true shame.    Concierge - Reda is great - always pleasant and proving a good service.    Special recommendations are to go to Said(bell-boy) and Abdelilah (Oasis Restaurant waiter) their exceptional service was what is expected within a 5* establishment and they deserve true recognition for all their hard work. They made us feel welcome and looked after us throughout our stay! I except a generic reply now from the Hotel Manger ‚Äì I would prefer a message to say that Said and Abdelilah will be provided with recognition for their all their hard work.,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NatalieNK

The garden area has hamakas and dehors. The breakfast is really good and you'll find lots of different food ( both european and from morokko).    - the customers service level is not a 5*; there're no towels enough for the customers at the pool if you're looking for an umbrella you must be very lucky they're not organized on bringing you what you ordered and it takes 30 mins to get a bottle of water.    Overall they're even having some renovations glad i did not have the room close to that location.    In the end the pool area is open to locals and often the hotel customer comes after the local people.

We asked the front desk to have it cleaned during our lunch. During lunch I did not find pepper on my table and the waiter said she would get one and brought me an empty one.When we returned to our room it had not been touched. A maid came running up and got on the cleaning task. I went back to the front desk and asked if they had a Quality Program and they said there was a questionnaire in the room. Guess what... There wasn't. Check out was not smooth. Stood in line several minutes to discover check out was at another desk.

I could not believe the expensive prices for the quality of food beveragesservice and rude staff!    Besides breakfast buffet food takes very long to prepare and it is not up to par! (It taste like dog food).I had to go to other hotels to enjoy a good meal.    Asking staff for anything in this hotel in English - they will totally dismiss you.  I felt such a huge sense of prejudice for not speaking the language or French. I compare this to going to other hotels during my stay in Marrakech.  I wish I would have spent an extra 100 or 200 to stay at Four Seasons La Mamounia or Pearl.    The service at the pool by a server Yosef was the worst service I ever experienced in my life.  There were no towels to lay on the day beds or dry off from the freezing cold pool. It also took 2 hours and yelling at a manager to get any service at the pool.  At the hotel bar in the evening they frequently snubbed our table too!  The level of unprofessionalism is shocking! I am still in awe.  The hotel was not even close to capacity for that to even an excuse.    The hotel has a vintage feel with dirty carpets clogged sinks and sewage smells.    During our stay we got weird knocks on the door in the middle of the night and felt very unsafe. Calling security for this matter and calling front desk for anything I found our calls getting transferred to multiple people disconnected and long hold times which was really frustrating!!  The staffs favorite word in this hotel is Sorry because they kept making errors.  The key players at this hotel is Zacaris and Abderrahmane.  These two tried to help out and stood out for trying but the experiences at this hotel were so negative I would never return here even if they paid me themselves!    Overall my stay was a nightmare. I wish I could have enjoyed my stay because the area and city is beautiful. It was stressful and a burden to stay at this hotel. I would not recommend it to my worst enemy.

Management is very attentive at signs of guests' dissatisfaction which can happen in Morocco due to extremely friendly but slow service. Current construction work unfortunately mars the peaceful atmosphere at the pool which has great lounging beds hammocks & assorted elegant furniture. I gave 4 stars despite the construction as I have been there before and the pool area is really wonderful. To be recommended with or without children as there are separate areas to enjoy different atmospheres. Prices for food and drinks are equal if not higher than continental Europe.

Food and drink in the hotel are quite expensive but pretty standard for a 5 star hotel. We stuck to non alcoholic cocktails which were ¬£8 each. Alcoholic ones were obviously more expensive. The breakfasts in the hotel were lovely- there was everything you could wish for and it was all freshly prepared. The location is great- its just a short walk into the main square. The only problem that we had were some noisy people staying below us that were screaming and shouting all night outside our room but the hotel security did try to quiet them down and this was not the fault of the hotel.

The hotel is centrally located we could walk to the medina in 10 minutes. It looks very luxurious from the outside as you are welcomed by a large fountain and the bell boys will come and carry your bags for you. We had booked a junior suite which had really nice views of the Atlas mountains. Couldn't fault the room and the bed was heavenly. We ate breakfast at the buffet and again the staff were very attentive and the food was really well cooked in front of you. The weather was nice enough for us to spend some time at the pool and I can have no complaints about the endless Corona's that were bought to me and a very nice lunch was also enjoyed. The highlight for me though was the So Lounge restaurant and bar. We have a lovely dinner in there with a fantastic band playing and was the perfect way to end our trip. The only think to watch out for is that signing everything to your room can be quite a shock come the end of your stay.

Hotel also charges expenses in home currency and takes a 3% upcharge.

I work for international travel company and I was working a local tour company hotels restaurants and other venues to host a financial services company for an incentive trip.    Working in a foreign country always has it challenges but that staff at the hotel went above and beyond to meet our group's need. Khadija was our primary contact and she stood by our side throughout the entirety of the program. It would not have been a success without her hard work and dedication to excellence.    Outside of the sales and events group there were plenty of stand out staff. From the gentlemen greeting guests at the front lobby to the staff at the restaurants. I was impressed with their genuine charisma. One young woman working in the breakfast restaurant (le Jardin) was very especially friendly and accommodating with our guests. Siham Jablane always went above and beyond to be welcoming and hospitable. She greeted guests with a big smile and made real conversation with them as she took them to their tables.    I would recommend the Sofitel to anyone looking to visit Marrkech.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Andrew S wrote a review Jan 2014,30,Sofitel Imperial Palace Marrakech,My wife and I stayed in here in January on a golf trip.  The hotel is undoubtedly a quality and impressive hotel with many of the sort of amenities bells and whistles that you would expect at this sort of hotel.  We did however get off to a bad start when we arrived after the long and tiring trip in the early afternoon to be told our room wouldn't be ready for two hours ! I have seen reviews on this hotel complaining about the same issue and if anyone from the hotel is reading this - GET IT SORTED - your reception is very poor.  The hotel could only have had an occupancy of well under 50% so why this should happen is beyond me - after a long trip you need to get into your room make yourself a cup of something sit out on the balcony ( which had a wonderful view of the Atlas mountains) and relax.  On the subject of making a cup of something - all hotels I have stayed in have a ketle and complimentary coffee tea and uht. Here we have an expresso coffee maker that you have to sort out how to use and 6 coffee capsules - all very well if you like tiny cups of strong expresso. After we ran out on day 3 I went to get some more and for some reason asked if they were complimentary only to be told that the first 6 are - the rest would cost 30dr (best part of ¬£3 each)! - I was not impressed. When I came to settle my bill I said that I would make mention of the 120dr for 4 coffee capsules in my report to trip advisor at which point they were immediately deleted from the bill!  The room itself was very pleasant and clean as you would expect. The lighting however was very dim - probably meant to be atmospheric but not good I'm told if you're trying to put on your mascara.  The breakfasts were superb and we were well looked after by a swarm of friendly waiters and the concierge service was every bit as good as I would expect in a hotel like this - friendly and knowledgeable.  The hotel is ideally situated being only a 15 minute walk into the medina but a taxi ride into the new city.  I would have no problem recommending this hotel if they ramp up their reception and put a kettle & some tea bags in the room - simple.,Date of stay: January 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Shrewsbury, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewsH3232EE

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Philipp_J1968 wrote a review Jan 2014,40,working in Marrakech for almost a month,I stayed here during December 2013 for a work event. Overall my impression of this hotel is very good. This hotel has really a lot of rooms - my office room was on one side of the hotel my sleeping room on the other and it took around 5 minutes of fast walking to get from one side to the next. The rooms have different setups all of which are quite fine. The condition of the rooms varies somewhat but in general is pretty fine. One problem I had and which I heard from several of my colleagues as well were the showers they had no water pressure and temperature was changing from very hot to very cold in an instant uncontrollable.  Sleeping quality was excellent bed pillows blanket all perfectly fine.  Breakfast has a good selection of everything needed. Cheese as well as ham often looks like it was sitting there already for 2 days but I can assure you it's fine to eat.  Lunch was always very good as well buffet with different choices all really good - and I can very much recommend the dessert buffet.  The staff at this hotel are friendly mostly although not always very efficient. The later we got in our event the more we were asked for gifts and souvenirs of our event it came to a point where we could not have lunch or breakfast without having staff asking us stuff - this I found somewhat unprofessional given their position and income etc maybe it is understandable.  Location of the hotel is quite good the interesting downtown area with Souks and the grand place is within walking distance.  Tip for going out: All kinds of people will want to talk to you guide you or show you things as soon as you step out of the hotel. Often they claim to work at the hotel etc... try to ignore them!,Date of stay: December 2013,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Canton of Aargau, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Philipp_J1968

We celebrated our daughter's birthday in the restaurant and had the Oriental menu. All our dishes were superb. Tip. Don't order a big starter. You receive a complimentary meze platter which is quite filling in itself. Breakfasts are superb - the same high quality and range of food you expect from a Sofitel hotel.

Our stay was pleasantly surprising- room was a good size (junior suite) but the most attractive aspect is the location (close enough to walk to Jamma El Fanna and the Plaza).    I think the hotel can definitely improve on certain aspects. Cleaners walk into room without knocking found insects in room and they don't replace water bottles frequently. Furthermore staff can at times be less focused (not opening doors and not serving promptly). All of the above is the least you should expect for a hotel striving to compete with the best.

On checking out the extremely rude cashier told us they had no record of us having booked half board despite me showing him proof from Thomas Cook.

Benefits from being a global chain but with a big taste of Morocco. High attention to detail in decor & ensuring that you feel that you are in Morocco. Live fires around the pool at night candles incense etc.  Service is fair but not excellent but I did not see any better service in Morocco.  However the food is absolutely excellent. The buffet breakfast is unbelievably good with so much choice from smoothies to your recipe pastries to rival any French patisserie omelettes authentic Moroccan pancake etc and a cute kids corner with mini pastries.  On site night club pools spa business facilities are good - break out snacks were irresistible but not healthy but who cares for a few days!

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Babar M wrote a review Oct 2013,50,Better than the reviews indicated,The hotel was v comfortable and had all the benefits of a first class organization. The staff was particulary friendly and courteous everyone had a smile on their faces which made you feel welcome. Special mention of Rachida in the breakfast restaurant who came all the way to our room to bring special tea to my wife who was feeling unwell and was so gracious and friendly Kareema in the restaurant who would bring a special glass of juice for me despite my protestations Mohammad who would come every afternoon to enquire if we needed any thing in the room and Mehdi chi chi who would serve the omelettes with a smile and Ameena on the front desk who made us feel welcome from the first day. it was a great experienceexcept for one small incident on leaving when the counter person on the desk Mehdi did not have change owed to me and i had to go ask for it a couple of times and when i advised that though it was a small amount i needed it for tips etc and he suggested that i use larger amount of coins that i already had after keeping me waiting and feeling guilty he handed over the amount owed. I let him have a piece of my mind regarding the principle of the matter never mind the smallness of the change owed. This was not expected of a five star hotel. Apart from this I would highly recommend the hotel and the staff which was one of the highlights of our trip.,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,london,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/894babarm

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Marc Lemmers wrote a review Oct 2013,50,Excellent and great hotel,Almost perfect and a real 5 star +++. A minor point but today important is the wifi which was very slow in the Suite and can be much better. Excellent and very kind staff at entrance and reception. Also for children the staffs are very kind and especially at the pool.  The food at the restaurant ‚ÄúOrangerie‚Äù was very good and the restaurant Staff (Mrs Wiam mgr Kabir and Atika) were very helpful and gave us an excellent service during the 2 times we had dinner.    The service at the restaurant ‚ÄúLounge‚Äù can be much better.  Regarding our room it was also very nice styled and well cleaned. Also the Staff is very attending and made it very comfortable during our stay.    Last but not least also compliments to the hotel managers Mr Benkirane and Mr Winckler who follows everything from distance for details to make it for everyone very comfortable during the stay.    The location of the Sofitel Imperial is also fantastic and close to the Medina. For me it is a real 5+ hotel.    Stayed end September/October 2013 with friends for a short business trip.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,RSE2 wrote a review Oct 2013,20,Looks the part but attention to detail and service absent.,We stayed at the Sofitel Marrakech for a long weekend in late September 2013 with a group of friends. The hotel is located about 10-15 minutes walk from the Jemma el Fna (main square) and the Souks. The Sofitel is very impressive from the outside set at the end of a wide boulevard fronted by fountains and with an impressive entrance fa√ßade.    We arrived after a short flight from London and had arranged to be met by a car from the hotel ‚Äì for which they charged a not inconsiderable 600 dirhams. The car was late and it took several phone calls to the hotel before the car arrived. It is our belief that it hadn‚Äôt even left the hotel when we first called. This meant an extended wait of almost an hour in the arrivals hall. On arrival the check in procedure seemed to take forever too with numerous forms to be filled in on top of the usual passport formalities.    The communal areas of the hotel appear to have had a recent facelift and both the main lobby and some of the secondary areas ‚Äì including the Art Hall - are very successful. What was slightly disappointing is the general lack of colour used in the d√©cor throughout the hotel. Marrakech is a city of vibrant sights sounds smells and colour but the palate of colours used in the Sofitel is much more muted. We felt this a bit of a shame. Outside there are two large pool areas with huge day beds and a plentiful supply of towels on hand. Some felt the water in the pools a little chilly ‚Äì probably unheated ‚Äì but generally the communal areas are pretty successful.    The breakfast buffet was reasonably extensive and food generally well cooked. There was a little bit of a lack of choice of cooked items though and for some reason the orange juice tasted slightly insipid. We did not eat in any of the restaurants so can‚Äôt comment on them.    One of the major problems in the hotel is the quality of service - aside from Reception and The Concierge who were generally helpful and personable. Put simply the standard of service both at breakfast and around the pool was woeful; just not up to standard for a 5* hotel. Everyone in our party had a similar experience. Waiters were inattentive. Food and drinks took ages to appear and often had to be asked for twice. The vibe they gave off was one of ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt care less‚Äù.    The bedrooms are nicely decorated ‚Äì albeit a little dull for Marrakech. Particular mention should go to the bed linen which was high quality cotton with enormous duck or goose down pillows and a wonderfully comfortable bed. The room was also fitted with black-out curtains so there was no sun pouring through the window at dawn! However there were some issues in both of the bedrooms that we stayed in that smacked of a lack of management oversight and/or staff training. These included: blown lightbulbs loose bathroom fixtures broken plug cracked sink leaking shower screen (free) internet that was on then off then on non-working telephone‚Ä¶ I could go on. I have all these sorts of small issues at home but then I‚Äôm not paying 5* hotel prices to stay at home.    In summary then Sofitel Marrakech is a bit all talk no walk. It has a great location and wonderful presence but it is badly let down by a lack of attention to detail in the bedroom and bathroom and a quality of service which is really not good enough. In a city like Marrakech which has such a wide variety of choice of hotels riads and villas it felt a real shame to have chosen Le Sofitel for our accommodation.,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, UK",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RSE2

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,hibachi wrote a review Sep 2013,30,"Pleasant international style hotel, walking distance to medina","Stayed here with group of friends. Nice place if you understand up front what you're getting and not getting:    - international style nice upscale hotel. Spacious lobby rooms and pool area.    - This is not a riad or ""quaint and quirky"" local place it's a Sofitel. But it's also not a Ritz Carlton. (it's funny to read the other reviews -- some people complaining that it's ""not local/authentic enough"" -- other people complaining that the food/drinks are ""too expensive"" -- and yet others complaining that the service wasn't awesome enough. Look it's an mid-upper-tier Euro style hotel period with all the pros and cons that implies.)    - food & drinks are not cheap (see previous point of this is an ""international style hotel""). However they do have a range European/American food items for when you're tired of Moroccan style food/tagines etc. are homesick or just physically sick and want comfort food. Food quality was OK not great but can be good to have familiar options.    - close enough to the old town to walk but why bother when you get get a cab for cheap at the front door (ask at the hotel what the price should be before you get in the cab).    - too far from most other locations to easily walk there for dinner. So if you come back to hotel to rest before dinner you will likely need to either stay in hotel to eat or take a taxi to/from another location.    - nice for coming back and relaxing if you are overdosing on culture clash or sensory overload from traveling in Morroco. Quiet spacious both inside and outside (garden/pool) areas to relax.    - good for traveling families with money due to the pool and courtyard areas where kids can play.    - note: none of the above comes cheap. So whether you will like this place depends on whether you value what it can offer in this location at this price.",Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hibachi
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Farahway wrote a review Sep 2013,50,Amazing staff and hotel,"I can't really fault this hotel at all. Before goingI read some not so good reviews but I couldn't see this at all when I went 6-11th september    There is so much to do in the hotel itself - spa and hammam plenty places to eat and restaurants shisha lounge nightclub two pools gym pool tables foosball table activities for children for example blackboards go karting and massive chessboard in the garden. The hotel staff and concierge are also very good at helping you plan your holiday and can help to pick out activities and excursions for you. I would recommend going to ""chez ali"" a spectacular show. Ourika valley and the waterfalls are also good to see.    The staff are so helpful especially a young lady called Lubna at reception who was unbelievably helpful friendly and went out of her way so much to help us I cannot praise her enough.    The location is close to the main square so you can walk there or get taxi's from right outside which the hotel staff help with. The security is very good too and there are always staff around including late at night.    There's plenty choice for food - you can have typical moroccan and french food tagines bbq quick snacks etc... The restaurants and deco are all so nice it definitely looks and feels like a 5 star hotel. Breakfast was really good so much choice. Same for lunch and dinner - I didn't eat at the hotel but I walked through the restaurant and saw the choice - it looked amazing.    We got upgraded and the room was massive and had everything you needed and more. Cleaned regularly and always left us more toiletries/tea and coffee if we needed.    I would definitely recommend staying at this hotel we did not have any bad experiences at all.",Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/farahway10

I would have to agree with other postings that the breakfasts are superb and cater for every possible taste.

Another and the biggest commendation to Reda the concierge. Reda was always delighted to see us and was very enthusiastic and bubbly and arranged numerous restaurant bookings transfers etc for us. Mme Catherine (it's Catron but near enough) was very impressed and even more so when he tried to disuade me from Marrakchi and on hearing that I had already been that week put it back on his list to recommend to other clients which I thought was a nice touch.    Now for the little but...this comes in the form of the fact that the night club on site is very very popular with the moneyed locals resulting in a traffic jam ouside the hotel most nights and lots of honking and engine revving from the owners of the porche and ferraris which turn up at night. If you want a good nights sleep don't get a room at the front of the hotel....though my step son thoroughly enjoyed photographing the flash cars from the bedroom window so he was happy.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Miss khunam wrote a review Aug 2013,40,Overpriced and lack of service,We arrived half an hour early prior to our check in time.. We were greeted nicely were given cold damp cloths and Moroccan tea. We was then showed to our butler who gave her her card and a quick tour around.    When it came to our actual check in times we was told our room wasn't ready and luckily my brother his wife and baby had a paid for a huge suite where we relaxed and waited for mine and my sisters room.    After 45minutes our so called butler rang on my brothers door and said our room was finally ready but it was just a hassle dragging our suit cases our room was on the other side of the hotel on the second floor.    We was happy we got a balcony room and the beds are real comfy. You can even charge ur iPhone on the little dock besides ur bed.    The reality that we found was that although the hotel was so very busy we still thought to deserve a better service for a five star luxury premium hotel. Our room cards didn't work a few times when we came from outside activities and this also happened to my brother mr Rahman its a pain when u are carrying a baby around from all days outdoor activities then to find ur room won't open so you have to make your way back down a floor and walk right back.    Also be-careful when you check out check ur bills as we got charged things from the fridge that we didn't use and u get charged hell of a lot for drinks that are not included in any of the buffets.    The hotel is huge and beautiful amazing scenery! Lovely pool and great facilities we paid for the spa and enjoyed it very well. Just a little shame that u have to pay for sauna for a bit extra.    During our stay we had The breakfast buffet and lunch sometimes dinner buffet depending on our plans on that day. The breakfast buffet wasn't so impressed by the tastes but the atmosphere was beautiful. Different counters had different things but it was always the same things everyday. Try going to the almaza mall it's 5mins drive away and is cheaper u have tgi Fridays a bit supermarket cheap water bottles etc... U have Pizza Hut ur have cages and shopping etc.. We realised that dinner was a rip off at our hotel with what was on offer. Cous Cous and oily meat camel meats etc all Moroccan style... But would've been nice for the extortionate price to have some international foods as well.    We didn't know how packed the hotel would be and waiting for a cab by the hotel wasn't so bad but I would've thought that there is someone who is always waiting to take tourists around..    Overall it was a nice place to stay you gota go and try the red house restruant 5mins walk from hotel. Was amazing a bit pricey but worth it live entertainment live relaxing music and not so packed we had one to one device and the food had variety of international and morroccan style foods.    Checking out of the hotel was a headache with all the bills they made up for us some I could understand like baby's milk or Extra drinks when we had buffets. But using fridge foods and saying that we don't get a transfer from hotel to airport in which we paid for in our package and arrived exactly the same way. Lack of communication and would be good if someone spoke English and also understood our English.    I did enjoy myself we all did and the hotel wasn't so bad if u have money to splash its all fine I guess. The service is over hyped thou I would say it was average for the price u pay. And as for our butler wel we never heard from her again after the first visit. So we more or less booked everything ourself. The desk on the very right with a large gentleman who wears glasses is the only guy who speaks lovely English and guided us on what to do he have grey advice always ask for him. He knows a lot!

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,subzy wrote a review Aug 2013,30,Expensive and over rated,We stayed from 11/8-16/8 with two kids aged 8 and 11. We booked two standard interconnecting rooms but arrived to find that they had not allocated interconnecting rooms. After 45 minutes of fuss they upgraded us to a 2-bed suite. Not a great start but at least the kids were staying close with us.    The hotel was packed mostly with French people. The pool was overcrowded if you asked for a towel the response was always 'there are none left'. Once towels are laid out in the morning there is no chance to get any later. My kids had to come through the lobby dripping to get to the room.    The food and drinks are extremely expensive. A bottle of mineral water (750ml) will set you back around ¬£4. There is NO concession for kids at all. Sadly it took us 3 days to realise that if we stepped outside there are many cafes that offer great food and drink at a quarter of the price.    There are no non-smoking areas in the hotel. The lobby is full of smokers as are all the restaurants; it's not what we are used to but that's to be found in all places around the city.    Breakfast was fine provided you arrived before 9am otherwise it was chaotic you'd be waiting for cutlery or water (which was in short supply) or beverages. Again probably due to the amount of guests. The choice of food was good.    The concierge was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. They planned a tour to Ourika Valley for us and we ended up starting our trek at almost midday because we left the hotel at 10am. The trip was very expensive and the driver was mute there and back there was no desire to tell us about anything despite us trying to ask him questions. (See my Ourika Valley review under Marrakech Tours coming soon).    When we asked the service men standing outside how much a taxi would cost they shrugged their shoulders and replied we should ask the driver. We asked for ESTIMATES and they refused to give us an idea. At one point I got cross and asked him how long had he been living in Marrakech and how come he didn't know the price to a local site. He walked off speaking in French. Naturally we paid over the odds for rides and the taxis were all parked outside the hotel and staff communicated through walkie talkies.    The hotel is located very well near all the major sites that you'd want to see. It's a little dated and the rooms a little shabby. The junior suite was large but there was only one bathroom which proved to be a minor irritation. Room service was OK. There is also a kids club which the kids enjoyed.    There are many hotels in this area of town and probably much cheaper. We like our luxury but did not feel pampered here at all. Some of the problems were due to the number of guests but others I feel were a direct result of poor management and lack of care.,Date of stay: August 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/subzy

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Shiv S wrote a review Aug 2013,30,Bottom line,-the staff from the doork men to housekeeping restaurant staff servers chefs were all wonderfull. They are polite courteous always helpful. Some can speak English mostly French. You can manage.    The hotel itself is located well close to the Medina. It looks a bit outdated. The suites are smaller then other Sofitel hotels.    There were issues with ants in our room to AC not properly cooling. Maintenance was quick to resolve the issues.    Overall as much as I appreciated the service it is not one of those properties that has an Wow affect. There is issue with a foul smell so they use a scent all over the place.. If you have allergies good luck.    I think most hotels in the area are similar if your use to US standards you may be dissappointed For Europians this might be acceptable or even exceed expectations.    The food is of good quality but is generally bland in Morocco and this was no exception. They need more international options and not just French or Moroccon. The food choices are very limited in Morocco after a while you get tired of the same old.    Overall it is well located safe place and most of all a great staff who are always ready to help.    If you decide to stay here chances are you will walk to the square in the evening caution must be exercised. It's only about 2 km but there are people who will stalk you then start talking nice to you will claim to be a staff at the Sofitel and are off duty. Will advise you for a place to eat etc.. they are just crooks not Sofitel employees avoid them at all cost.    The Square is another beast.

It is grand with an excellence service beautiful pool staff that care ideal settings.

We were greeted nicely were given cold damp cloths and Moroccan tea. We was then showed to our butler who gave her her card and a quick tour around.    When it came to our actual check in times we was told our room wasn't ready and luckily my brother his wife and baby had a paid for a huge suite where we relaxed and waited for mine and my sisters room.    After 45minutes our so called butler rang on my brothers door and said our room was finally ready but it was just a hassle dragging our suit cases our room was on the other side of the hotel on the second floor.    We was happy we got a balcony room and the beds are real comfy. You can even charge ur iPhone on the little dock besides ur bed.    The reality that we found was that although the hotel was so very busy we still thought to deserve a better service for a five star luxury premium hotel. Our room cards didn't work a few times when we came from outside activities and this also happened to my brother mr Rahman its a pain when u are carrying a baby around from all days outdoor activities then to find ur room won't open so you have to make your way back down a floor and walk right back.    Also be-careful when you check out check ur bills as we got charged things from the fridge that we didn't use and u get charged hell of a lot for drinks that are not included in any of the buffets.    The hotel is huge and beautiful amazing scenery! Lovely pool and great facilities we paid for the spa and enjoyed it very well. Just a little shame that u have to pay for sauna for a bit extra.    During our stay we had The breakfast buffet and lunch sometimes dinner buffet depending on our plans on that day. The breakfast buffet wasn't so impressed by the tastes but the atmosphere was beautiful. Different counters had different things but it was always the same things everyday. Try going to the almaza mall it's 5mins drive away and is cheaper u have tgi Fridays a bit supermarket cheap water bottles etc... U have Pizza Hut ur have cages and shopping etc.. We realised that dinner was a rip off at our hotel with what was on offer. Cous Cous and oily meat camel meats etc all Moroccan style... But would've been nice for the extortionate price to have some international foods as well.    We didn't know how packed the hotel would be and waiting for a cab by the hotel wasn't so bad but I would've thought that there is someone who is always waiting to take tourists around..    Overall it was a nice place to stay you gota go and try the red house restruant 5mins walk from hotel. Was amazing a bit pricey but worth it live entertainment live relaxing music and not so packed we had one to one device and the food had variety of international and morroccan style foods.    Checking out of the hotel was a headache with all the bills they made up for us some I could understand like baby's milk or Extra drinks when we had buffets. But using fridge foods and saying that we don't get a transfer from hotel to airport in which we paid for in our package and arrived exactly the same way. Lack of communication and would be good if someone spoke English and also understood our English.    I did enjoy myself we all did and the hotel wasn't so bad if u have money to splash its all fine I guess. The service is over hyped thou I would say it was average for the price u pay. And as for our butler wel we never heard from her again after the first visit. So we more or less booked everything ourself. The desk on the very right with a large gentleman who wears glasses is the only guy who speaks lovely English and guided us on what to do he have grey advice always ask for him. He knows a lot! Very helpful he was wish I remembered his name.,Date of stay: August 2013,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jkhanum

Our room had ""garden view"" which might lead to wrong interpretation we had indead a view on the garden which is a piece of lawn between the building and the surrounding wall and behind is a quite busy street fortunately rooms are sound proofed but you can't keep the window open in summer.  A part from that a perfect stay which ended with an amazing breakfast buffet with food of all kind in top quality have never seen such a choice for such a high quality standard..

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Pruce1 wrote a review May 2013,10,"Lovely Pool, lovely bed.........but awful service from staff!!!!",The hotel picture of the pool are exactly what you get however the service is very poor.  The Pro's- Pool and day beds were great comfortable bed in room the service and greeting on arrival was good- massage was good  The con's- Just given a key then its try to find your room the service around the pool was poor drinks were incorrect wine was warm lemon tart cost approx ¬£12.00. The room we were allocated was 275- this overlooked the night club and on a Saturday night at approx 3am its a song of people's car horns that keep you awake- however when I mentioned to the front desk they are aware of this yet in a hotel 50% full they still put guests in them. On leaving the hotel I was chased and interigated over a bill of ¬£7.00!!!! However I had already checked out and was served by a gentlemen called (Hellum) who was incrediably rude and paid my bill which was a large sum of money. This gentlemen was the face of the Sofitel and he was an insult to a really good chain of hotels- this is just a bad one!!!! I really would visit Marrakech however I wouldnt rebook at this hotel sadly.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,AliHampshire wrote a review May 2013,30,Good on the surface but once you dig deeper...........,We picked this hotel primarily for the pool area and proximity to town. The pool is freezing so far we have seen 2 people brave the icy waters they didnt last long. The jacuzzi is also freezing. The beds around the pool are good and comfy with lots of cushions so you can get into some interesting sunbathing positions.  Service around the pool is rubbish. It is slow and it is hit and miss whether you get what you ordered. They will bring you the wrong beer and not change it and bring warm wine thinking that we would want to drink white wine that was warmer than the pool temperature !!! The drink prices are high so come prepared to spend a lot if you want to have a few warm drinks around the pool. We did complain but we were just ignored cold chipswarm drinks all to be expected or so it would seem.  We had lunch from the pool menu and the food was ok. Not worth the money but hey ho we are on holiday.  The rooms are ok nothing fancy but nothing grotty. The beds were super big and comfy. They could do with bit of love and attention. Do make sure you are not in a room over looking the nightclub as you will not sleep the boom boom boom of the music is nothing compared to the noise of everyone leaving and revving their engines at 3 am. Free wi-fits a bonus.  They seem to have a lot of staff just not sure what they all do. Lady concierge was a bit scary. Watch the taxi prices we asked for a taxi was told it would be 60 d only to get in the taxi and be told he wouldn't take less than 200 d. The hotel needs to arrange taxis that don't rip the guests off.,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Marrakech, Morocco",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliHampshire
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Carol wrote a review May 2013,30,Sadly not what we were expecting,We are currently staying at the hotel and have been here for 7 nights.  Positives first  Beautiful pool and surroundings lounge area etc  Clean and fresh smelling throughout the hotel    Negatives - quite a few unfortunately.  It's the weekend and we were maxed out at the pool area today with locals and all of their children screaming children at that. They are allowed in to use the pool by paying in and if it wasn't so busy perhaps this would be doable but we spent the whole day listening to screaming children and loud people on their phone and it was sooooo awful and really made today very unbearable and definitely not relaxing. We also had to compete with the non residents for beds this shouldn't be the case. This all happened beside the larger pool which normally doesn't have that many children just a few can't imagine how bad the other pool would have been. Surely the hotel is making enough money from everyone staying there with the quite expensive pool side bar menu and drinks that they don't have to use it as a public pool also???    If you want a bed you have to be a very early riser we have had to set our alarm to get a bed that wasn't beside the kiddies pool most beds are gone by 8/830am and we have witnessed a lot of the pool side staff holding a selection of beds for some of the residents for a fee one occasion the pool side attendant had held three beds so the lady could choose which one she wanted and this was at 10am when everyone was walking around looking for one this shouldn't be allowed.  To make things worse we were asked for our room number as we tried to get to the pool this morning as the door man was saying how many people come and try and use the pool for free which is what he was insinuating we were doing so quite insulting.    The poolside food really is mediocre and the menu very limited only a few dishes to choose from and it hasn't changed all week with not very healthy options either. Service at lunch isn't too great either.    If you don't have breakfast included its quite expensive ¬£50 for two for a buffet which is nice enough and lots to choose from however if you're not looking for such a big breakfast as we were not it was a bit of a waste of money. We discovered a great cafe right opposite which is part of the hivernage hotel called la table du marche and they do wonderful breakfasts at less than half the price and their lunch menu is much more variable with great fresh salads and again half the price would totally recommend trying there. They also have the most amazing cake selection!!!!!    All in all l wouldn't return to this hotel as the rooms were pretty basic and ours very far away from everything....gym was very tiny and two machines were broken and the only great thing is the pool so l guess it depends on what you're looking for in a holiday but the hotel sadly does not have the feel of a 5* hotel......,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolmae
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Jee Young K wrote a review May 2013,10,Pleasant but BEWARE - dirty and unhygenic,"I will be short - we have three girls aged 5 4 and 12 months old. also took my parents aged 64 72. We stayed in 2 Junior Suite room.    My baby 12 months old vomited 2 mins after eaten the mashed potato from pool bar/ restaurant at the hotel. (suspect they used rotten milk/ left mashed potato outside for the flies / birds to endulge?) Salad was clearly old / smooshed from being left outside too long.    My mother had diarrhea from the salad let alone my baby. I asked to speak to the manager but he didn't even give us a refund but offered us juices which probably was left outside overnight or something (didn't feel like it).    Service of some of the waitresses are crap - not very professional. This waitress at the pool bar didn't even bring any glasses for children to drink water in the heat takes away the plates without asking and we were still eating!!!    My baby's diarrhea was so bad we had to ask for a Morroccan DR for medicine.    The rooms are not cleaned when we arrived (bathroom floor had blood stains!!!) and clearly they don't hoover the carpets in the bedroom while you are staying! (perhaps they only do that when new guests arrive?? ""if"" they do!)    Housekeeping - TVs sound don't work suddenly overnight patio doors to the balcony is broken heating doesn't work in one of the rooms there is no kettle at the room (you have to ask for it!) when you ring for housekeeping or room service it takes ages to get to talk to someone else.    Just overall felt like it was not very well managed.    So I wouldn't personally stay there again unless the management is changed and train their staff to be more hygenic and housekeeping is well managed.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,doc_skid wrote a review May 2013,30,Could have been better for the money,We escaped the medina and a riad for a little peace and quiet at the Sofitel. Nice grounds great bar tender and good bar food. Breakfast was quite good the next AM. BUsy loud buffet but once you sit down in you space to eat the nose fades.    The hotel was very busy with a Grand Prix race occupying most everyone's time... maybe that is why the staff seemed so inattentive? The room was not ready on arrival so we went to the patio for drinks. Even after several hours we wnet in and the room still was not ready. After being delayed we were finally given keys around 530 PM and on arrival in the room found the toilet not cleaned.... urine dried around the toilet and floor. yuck I am dude and was bugged by this. The bed was fine and the patio/terrace was nice as well. The area in front of the hotel and in lobby was a little loud but honestly I was OK with this as the grounds out back were quiet and lovely.    For the money spent I was more than a bit disappointed.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Tony1Tony wrote a review Apr 2013,20,Marrakech disappointment,The Hotel is a lovely building but it has problems . Our room faced the city and we were woken every night with terrible street noise and also at 4 am a blast of wailing from the Mosque. On the first day we were given a small free juice by the pool. Many of the small glasses were still by the pool and on the edge of the flowerbeds when we left . The pool area was not regularly cleaned. Also the 2 steps into the pool were broken and very dangerous. The restaurant food and service was average and we expected better. On the third day I had to ask 3 times for our room to be made up  it was finally done at 4 in the afternoon!. We had an early flight on our last day so I paid the bill the night before . Then as we left the hotel at 6am I was accosted by the front door porter who demanded my room number . I asked why and he said he needed to check we had paid . I refused to give him my number and explained to him that what he was suggesting was not a good thing. I told him I had paid my bill . I virtually had to push him out of the way to leave the building . He then rushed to the front desk and the duty manager came out  recognised me and did not pursue the matter !!! I do not expect this treatment in a luxury hotel.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,JMP1977 wrote a review Apr 2013,30,"Beautiful setting, great location, overall service levels a bit lacking.",I recently stayed at the Sofitel in Marrakech to escape the long winter in London having previously stayed at the property for a conference. Overall the stay was enjoyable and relaxing however the service levels are a bit schizophrenic with staff often more concerned about earning a tip than providing excellent customer service. The one exception to this was the staff at breakfast mainly a young lady by the name of Fatima who took the time to get to know us remembering our likes and dislikes from days previous and always providing excellent service with a smile.,Date of stay: April 2013,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMP1977

Rooms are spacious and have Moroccan touches. Appreciated welcoming Moroccan pastries and strawberries provided. Service was friendly. Breakfast is good with Moroccan and european food. Pools are nice with attentive towel service.    Negatives: Street outside hotel is NOISY with conversations and cars on Saturday night (no such problem on Sunday and Monday night). The noise continued until 6 AM and made it impossible to sleep. The room windows badly need double if not triple glazing. As well it was a loonnng walk from lobby to my room. And I didn't like that the toilet was in one room and the sink in a separate room around the corner - this seems a French or Accor thing a Novatel room in Paris had the unergonomic design.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Ottawa, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WarrenL677
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,tommyuteiverden wrote a review Apr 2013,20,OK hotel - poor service !,The hotel is OK - no more no less - given a 5* rating. Service were in general slow and poor. Slow check-in: The receptionist asked for our passports left us for 10-15 minutes (no welcome-drink provided) came back then asked us to fill in forms (including name passport number etc - nothing filled in beforehand). Then gave us the key and left - without telling us where or how to get to our room!  Cleaning of room were variable throughout the stay. First day we left at 9am only to return at 5pm to an uncleaned room. Housekeeping then came at 5.30 as we were showering and getting ready to go out for dinner. They asked 3 times the next 30minutes only to the same message from me: Come back after 6.30. I assume the cleaning lady did not understand english so I called housekeeping and asked them to come back after 6.30. Provided drinking water were not resupplied this first day. Minibar not refilled. Shampoo was not resupplied. No price list of minibar. Later 3 bottles of water were suppled only to no supply again. The room was OK stained furniture in the room (bed linen were clean).  Stained chairs in the L'Orangerie restaurant.  Had breakfast at the hotel breakfast restaurant one of the mornings ($25/person) - were seated by the head waiter who then quickly left. We were seated at a conference room of some sort next to the restaurant and with very bright lighting. No ambiance for breakfast for us. Table with stained tablecloth. No cutlery provided by the staff (had to pick it our self from a nearby table) no staff came to take order for coffee - had to look for staff and ask twice to get regular black coffee! And the breakfast buffet is cleared on-time: Make sure not to be late! Food was just okey - no value for money !  Then some pro: The staff are friendly and always greets you with a 'bonjour' or 'bonsoir' when you pass them. The concierge were helpful and friendly (though a mistake made us to arrive at a restaurant booked by the concierge 90minutes before it open - however the concierge swiftly called a nearby restaurant as a replacement). Also pro: Nice garden and pool area.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,GarryDesAmours wrote a review Apr 2013,40,Excellent location with top service,Perfect location! Our room (429) had a perfect view of the pool and the Atlas mountain.  The bed was very comfortable.  The heated pool was great considering the cool temperature we experienced during our stay in Marrakech.  Kudos to the staff - from the Reception to the Concierge recommending some good restaurants the folks at the Restaurant (Jardin des Senteurs - Rachida Sihom) and even the housekeeping lady. Everybody was so nice to us. They made us feel at home.    A few minor glitches:  The lighting of the room was really poor.  Internet access was terrible and sometimes it didn't work at all  A water leak at the wall of the WC - although we never reported it - was annoying  Expensive food & beverages e.g. A bottle of water at the restaurant at $12 was a total rip-off - same thing for a beer at $12. Breakfast at $30 is expensive if you only have an omelet some juice and a cup of coffee. Sunday brunch at 500 DH (>$60)was ok for me for expensive for many.  I wish the hotel would have an Excursion desk. They concierge quoted 200 Euros for a day excursion to Essaouira for 2 while we did the same excursion for 50 Euros via Sahara Tours with a guide. A city tour at 700 DH (almost $90) was a scam since the objective of the guide was to take you to expensive places to buy carpets and other stuffs. He didn't even take us to the places we were supposed to visit.  Our Junior Suite was just a mere Superior room not a junior suite per se.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,43reds wrote a review Apr 2013,50,"Stay at the Palais Imperial, not the Lounge & Spa",We stayed at the Sofitel at the beginning and the end of a bicycle trip around Morocco and had two very different experiences. While the Palais Imperials and Lounge & Spa share a facility and management by all appearances our overall experience was far far superior at the Imperial.    We found the reception cold and somewhat surly throughout our stay at the L&S. Check-in took an eternity (particularly painful for those arriving from overseas) and lacked warmth which was pretty much true of every encounter we had or witnessed at the front desk. In fact we had to make four calls -- finally seeking assistance from the Accord folks who had to patch us through -- just to get someone pick up the phone there to book transportation from the airport prior to our arrival. We had reserved a room with two beds for the kids and got a double and they made no apparent effort to accomodate a request to change. We were sent off to find our rooms on are own upon arriving and the service failed to improve after that.    We had just the opposite experience however at the Imperial where the staff without exception welcoming friendly and eager to make sure guests felt appreciated. We were escorted to our room by a guest service specialist greeted by name every time we walked through the lobby and saw the same specialist who checked in with us a few times during our stay. Everything in the hotel smells fresh and floral - there are beautiful bouquets throughout and lovely furnishings.    The Spa is pretty and calm. Indoor dip pool there is for adults only and the small gym is just that - small and quite aromatic not in a good way. Another area of the S&L has a foos-ball table and pool table which is fun but the noise from folks playing can be heard in the rooms above.    The pool area (shared by both hotels) is simply fabulous - vast and gorgeous with ample comfortable seating and pool beds (including the world's most comfortable hammocks) two bars chair service (slow but friendly) and cute touches like a cotton candy/gelato stand and small swinging cribs for infants. The food was decent at the poolside restaurant and people watching marvelous. The entire area is covered with flowering vines and gorgeous landscaping and feels very special.    Breakfast is great at the restaurant buffet but the lunch less so. Service is very spotty. At no meal was the service particularly efficient or friendly and pretty much the same can be said for the terrace off the main lobby where we were twice ignored entirely and once waited more than 20 minutes for a simple drink. We had one meal at the Orangerie which was good but for the sticker shock when it turned out that our two Kir Royales were charged at US$ each!    The rooms are lovely with comfortable beds nice bathrooms Hermes bath products and nice robes/towels. Our suite in the L&S was so poorly lit you couldn't see a book to read after the sun set but the suites on the Imperial side are wonderful on every count. The views are fab of the Atlas mountains and pool area.    Westerners should not worry about what to pack for a stay here as it is anything goes at the pool restaurants and lobby area. Most guests dressed quite fashionably and few felt to compelled toward the modesty in dress that would be more appropriate in a Riad within the medina or in areas frequented by locals.    There are several restaurants and clubs an easy stroll from the Sofitel if you aren't up for the chaos of the walled city and the souks although that is a must-see at some point during your trip. It is more fun and less intimidating with a guide as it is truly chaotic and VERY easy to get lost. Taxi to the airport was a fixed rate of 150 dirhams.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Alexandria, Virginia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/43reds
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Ashley J wrote a review Apr 2013,40,Great chill out,We have been to Marrakech quite a few times in the last few years and have always stayed in riads. Now don't get me wrong riads can offer some of the best servcie available but can take on a bit of a 'house party' atmosphere where you can feel obliged to socialise.    This is not what we wanted on this particular occasion. After a stressful few months we wanted to chill in a relaxing environment not too far from the action and not feel obliged to 'join in'.    Having had drinks in the Sofitel on a few occasions before and having stayed in sister hotels before we were confident our needs would be met and they most certainly were.    Upon arrival we were advised our room was not ready no real surprise at it was only 11.30am so we had a long leisurely lunch and checked in at about 2.30pm. We had been upgraded to a suite with pool and Atlas views.....very pleasant. The room was very comfortable with all of the amenities you would expect.    We always stay on a room only basis so i cannot comment on the food save for the pool bar which whilst a little on the expensive site it was not over the top and was very pleasant.    The hotel is within 15 minutes stroll of the square where all of the action is and 10 minutes from the new town.    In all i would recommend this hotel and would stay again.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,martin1England wrote a review Mar 2013,40,Very Good! Definitely a place to stay!!,Having stayed in a Riad in the Medina a couple of months earlier I decided that as I was returning with my partner son and daughter it would be better to stay in a large hotel so that the girls could chill around tbe pool whilst my son and I went mountain biking! We had a two bedroom suite and it was very nice!  The check in was a bit of a faff as they spend a bit too long trying to make it special whereas I would rather they just gave me the key and let me get on with it!!  The breakfast whilst fairly costly was excellent!! They did not charge for the kids even though my 15 yr old son is a monster who ate twice as much as us!!  The guys around the pool worked really hard and kept everyone happy (even the French...)  Only grumble was the staff on the ground floor terrace at night  who despite outnumbering the guests still managed to take around 30 mins to conjure up a basic cocktail!!  Would happily recommend this hotel though close to all the action yet very relaxed!!,Date of stay: March 2013,,"Hunstanton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martin1England
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,JE_UK wrote a review Mar 2013,30,In honesty you can do a lot better,"I don't want to run this hotel down; it has a nice pool and gardens and is fine if you are only looking for the bottom end of the 5* market. However if you can possibly spare just a little extra money you really should stay at the Four Seasons. The Sofitel is fundamentally fine if you are using it as a B&B (although beware of the overzealous concierge). However if you are travelling with a family or looking for any service above bare acknowledgement you must go to the Four Seasons.    I do not work for the FS and have stayed in lots of hotels in Marrakech. The service in the Sofitel is just weak and at times rude. The selection of food is low if you are here for more than a couple of days and the hotel is quite simply totally inflexible and boring. For example if you would like a snack in the outside lounge you have to order from the room service menu and the room service chap turns up with his trolley and bill; there is no joined-up thinking and if you ask you are just ignored.    We had a ""butler"" during our stay; in short my 4 month old baby was more use and told less lies.    The Sofitel is ‚Äúokish‚Äù but lacks leadership (the management are invisible and when asking for a manager you are fobbed-off) and you will get considerably better value for money at the Four Seasons.",Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Cheltenham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JE_UK
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Angi00 wrote a review Mar 2013,10,Do not go.,Travelling with two young kids. This hotel is on a busy road. Rooms are old noisy and dirty. We were given a room that smelled of sewage and could not get a replacement until late night. When threatening to leave we were offered a replacement room that was old dirty with not working taps. Staff at front desk is unprofessional does not pick up the phone and takes ages to perform the basic tasks. We booked a 5 day holiday and left after a nightmare of a night and a never ending discussion with front desk. I would advise not to book this hotel: there are lots of equally priced and better managed properties in Marrakech.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Mindful_Travels wrote a review Mar 2013,40,Hotel does not treat all guests the same.,The two Marrakech Sofitels are situated together (look like the same building) and it is hard to tell which is which when you arrive. Once we figured out which hotel we were staying at we checked into the rooms. The room which was assigned to us was at the very back of the hotel facing a busy street and had noisy neighbours. The room was old dirty and showing the age of the hotel. Things were falling apart in the room such as the hook on the back of the door fell off and i stepped on it as i walked into the room.    After being kept awake all night long from the noise we asked the next day to move to another room but even thought we had stayed more then two weeks in a Sofitel hotels across Morocco it did not matter to them. Finally after emailing the general manager something was done to assist us. Finally they moved us to a room which was not as noisy except for the final night.    When i mentioned that my partner was not well the staff went out of their room to make him a bath light candles and spread rose peddles around the room.    Be careful if your room happens to have a coffee machine. There is nothing that indicates that there is a fee for the coffee but they charge you when you check out. It is the same machine that was in our Sofitel hotel in Casablanca which does not charge for the coffee. The machine did not work right and we ended up using a couple of the coffee pouches and received no coffee    The hotel is perfectly situated so that it is an easy walk to the Medina.,Date of stay: January 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"New Delhi, India",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mindful_Travels

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Blink76 wrote a review Feb 2013,40,"Pool/gardens excellent, everything else alright","There's a lovely big swimming pool and a nicely maintained gardens with fountains with lots of nice places to sit. All the communal areas look great. There are actually 2 pools and an outdoor jacuzzi but the larger pool and jacuzzi aren't heated so would only be usable in Summer.    The location is great: walking distance (15 mins) to the Jemaa el-Fnaa but far enough from the hectic city centre to feel relaxing. There are always taxis outside but they never use the meter and charge more than London taxis if you don't haggle.    Apart from that it's ok. Our room wasn't very 5 star. It looked more like the average of every 3 star hotel room I've stayed in but with nicer toiletries and an ipod dock. Other services are a bit over-priced and average; e.g. slightly tasteless coffees expensive spa so we tended to go elsewhere - and there are plenty of places nearby.  - There's a grocery store and an off-licence behind the apartment block on Mohammed VI that faces that road's junction with Avenue El Kadissia.  - The excellent Comptoir Darna restaurant/bar is 3 mins away on Avenue Echouhada.  - For hamman we went to the lovely Bahia Riad & Spa.    Our stay wasn't without gliches: the key card stopped working the TV stopped working twice and had to be replaced and someone else's minibar was billed to our room. There was confusion about whether breakfast was included - the hotel voucher we received from Expedia didn't say and the receptionist said ""your breakfast will be served here"" and there was no price listed anywhere so we thought it was - the buffet receptionist just ticked off our room number on a list so we were suprised to get a bill at the end which the hotel later agreed to remove from the final bill. We probably should have checked on check-in whether breakfast was included so I would advise other guests to check. Service was generally a bit slow but friendly. The one thing that's off-putting is that right outside the hotel wall there's a strip of land covered in rubbish; the Sofitel really should clean this up.",Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blink76

I recommend highly,I stayed at the Sofitel on a short business trip with colleagues from the UK in Dr Nazar's group and found the hotel to be very comfortable and the staff very accommodating. I would like to mention a few names that went to extraordinary lengths to make this the best hotel I've stayed in whilst in morocco.    The head chef Ahmed El Defaa is a true gentlemen and a superb chef. He prepared my favourite Moroccan dish for our group even though it was off the menu. This level of service is not readily available in other hotels of a similar calibre.    Other staff that deserve to be mentioned for their excellent manners and etiquettes are - Farah Anas Abdel waheed Btissam Hicham Rachid Jamal Ydrys Rabii Zanti and Bonging Mohamet.

Greeted with mint tea and refreshments and didn't have to queue to check in as you are seated in a loung area and the hotel staff come to you to book you in. We had an outstanding room with a balcony overlooking the pool. Breakfast on the balcony in the sunshine was a very relaxing start to the day and extremely well presented.The bars and restaurants are amazing especially the ""So Good"" restaurant in the adjoining Sofitel Lounge & spa hotel which you can enjoy full facilities and still charge to your room in the other hotel. The staff are some of the most helpful I've experienced anywhere and can't do enough to help and make sure your stay is as comfortable and relaxing as possible. The Souks left me feeling a bit uncomfortable as they are very overbearing but you HAVE to visit them they are exaclty as you would imagine them. A trip to the Atlas Mountains is a must as well but be warned that to see the waterfalls you have to walk practically vertical over quite dangerous rocks. It was easy to get the currency at the airport as its not available outside of Morrocco and as long as you keep your receipt they will exchange it back on departure.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Piers K wrote a review Jan 2013,50,Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,I stayed here on a weekend visit to Marrakech to run in the Marrakch Marathon. It was a great choice of hotel for this as the start/finish of the marathon was only a 5 minute walk away. Although outside the city walls they are within sight and it will only take 15/20 minutes on foot to reach the Koutoubia and the main square.  The hotel grounds and 2 large pools are very well kept and the water was crystal clear with loads of comfy loungers and beds to sit out in the sun around the pools. The meals seemed a bit pricy but you can't fault the breakfast for quantity and quality.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,John D wrote a review Jan 2013,50,New Year in Marrakech,This hotel provided fantastic accommodation and a New Year party to remember. However when we arrived just after lunchtime on 31st Dec and tried to run a bath there wasn't any hot water. In fact there wasn't any water coming out of the hot tap at all. We reported this to the front desk but nobody came to investigate and after about an hour some hot water did start to dribble through. Not what you would expect from a five star hotel. We had hot water for the rest of our stay and I would say that this was the only disappointing feature of our stay there. The food is first class especially the buffet breakfast and the staff couldn't do enough for us. The New Years eve party was really well organised and considering they were catering for a couple of hundred people the service and quality of our five course meal was exceptional. We had a junior suite with a view over the pool and gardens. However it was the distant view of the Atlas Mountains especially first thing in the morning that took our breath away. The hotel is conveniently located only 15 minutes walk away from the Medina but you do have to watch yourself crossing the roads. Stick close to locals crossing the road and go when they go! If you fancy doing something different next New Year then check out this hotel and its party but be prepared to wait for the bath to fill!,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Stockport, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnD597

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,JK-foodie wrote a review Nov 2012,20,Unimaginably Poor Service,Dear Sofitel Marrakech    I am writing regarding an almost comical string of mistakes and mismanagement that very nearly led to my recent holiday at the Marrakech Sofitel Palais Imperial becoming a disaster and certainly left me with a poor impression of your hotel. I would like to ask for compensation as described over the course of this email.    This email has been sent to Sofitel Marrakech front desk Sofitel Marrakech reservations and Sofitel head office and also posted to tripadvisor. Please cc each other in any response ‚Äì the first response I receive will be posted to tripadvisor.    1) Booking: We attempted to make a corporate booking through your reservations desk Meriem was dealing with our request. The whole process was a disaster ‚Äì entire strings of emails went unanswered for 3 ¬Ω weeks in the end in desperation we gave up and decided to book directly through the Accor hotels website. It transpired the ‚Äòcorporate rate‚Äô Meriem had secured us (or would have if she ever answered phone or email) was in fact substantially more expensive than your standard rate. We booked online. I booked a superior room with mountain view for myself and my travelling companion.  2) Upgrade: We complained and Meriem offered us an upgrade to a junior suite by way of apology. I booked and prepaid for airport transfer for 600Dhiram each way through Meriem. Two days before our trip we reconfirmed that the upgrade had been put in place. We flew to Marrakech.  3) Arrival: We arrive at Sofitel Marrakech. Check-in is slow but eventually (after being given another guest‚Äôs checkin forms including their credit card number name and address) we are checked in. I am given the key to room 277. I go up. It is a small double room the carpet is peeling from the floor there are brown stains on the bathrobes the view is of the carpark the windows don‚Äôt close properly so the noise from the adjacent road is deafening and there is a strong smell of damp.  4) Complaining: We come down to complain that the upgrade hasn‚Äôt been applied to our room and could we please move to a Junior Suite. ‚ÄòBut you have been upgraded to a mountain view room‚Äô comes the reply. I say that in the first instance my upgrade should be to a Junior Suite and in the second instance my room overlooks the carpark when in any case I already paid extra for a mountain view. ‚ÄòNo you paid for a standard room ‚Äì we upgraded you to a mountain view‚Äô. I show my original booking confirmation for a mountain view room ‚Äì the reply is ‚Äòit doesn‚Äôt matter what it says on your confirmation ‚Äì on our paperwork it says we upgraded you to a mountain view room‚Äô. I show the email confirming our upgrade to a suite ‚Äòwe have no suites available‚Äô. We ask to speak to a manager. Surprisingly there isn‚Äôt one. The receptionist whose name I think was Othoman was rude both in the content and tone of his speech. The best we get is a promise that the hotel will move us the next day and refund us for the first night‚Äôs stay.  5) Complaining again. The next morning Saad (at reception) is very helpful ‚Äì we will be moved by midday and at the time we will be told what our compensation will be ‚Äì he agrees we should get the first night‚Äôs stay for free and some free spa treatments but he needs to confirm first with his manager. In the end we move rooms at 4pm (hotel ‚Äòsystems‚Äô were down so he couldn‚Äôt expedite room service to prepare the suite) still not confirmation of our compensation as ‚Äòthe manager is still in lunch‚Äô. The next day by the way we are again three times promised confirmation of the compensation which again and again fails to materialise ‚Äì Saad is unable to reach his manager (here a plea ‚Äì I think Saad was the one person during our entire stay who attempted to help us and I don‚Äôt want him to get into any trouble). Still at time of writing I have no idea if you intend to compensate as agreed. In fairness the junior suite is delightful well maintained and has a view of the mountains.  6) Insult to Injury: 5pm and hour after we have checked in to our room. I have just showered and am lying naked on the bed. My travelling companion is in the bathroom. The door opens (no knock) and two other guests enter. I wrap the sheet around myself and find out they have just been checked in ‚Äì to my new room. They leave embarrassed. I too am left embarrassed.  7) Departure. I have prepaid airport transfer for 1200 Dirham in total to and from the hotel for my group. On my checkout bill is 250 Dihram for transfer from the airport and 350 Dihram for transfer from the airport. I am in a hurry not to miss my flight but it takes 20 minutes of showing my email confirmations and receipts to the receptionist before he begrudgingly agrees to remove it from my bill. I am left perplexed as to why you charged me double the price as an advance booking that I would have paid at the hotel. The receptionist says he will get the concierge to meet me outside the hotel and show me to my car. 10 minutes later I go directly to the concierge and ask if my car is outside as he has yet to come to meet us. ‚Äòhave you paid?‚Äô he asks. Yes I say and lead him to the receptionist who helped me. The concierge takes another 20 minutes to be convinced that I may in fact be allowed to board the car I paid for. Incidentally the journey to the airport takes about 5 minutes. I prebooked the transfer to avoid being ripped off by unscrupulous taxi drivers. I believe a taxi would have cost 50-100 Dirham each way perhaps one tenth what you charged me and then attempted to charge me again. I nearly miss my flight as a result of the delays at checkout.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Qianloong wrote a review Nov 2012,20,"Almost, but not quite",The negatives experienced in this hotel are pretty horrific yet there are several positives that mean you can't eliminate the possibly that one day it might work. The issues i experienced in staying at this hotel for 14 hours were;  1. Blood on my bedsheets that was from an unknown source. Not enough to suggest a prior murder but too much to ignore even though it was not a full moon.  2. My pressing was 20 mins late in being delivered despite the Laundry Dept having 12 hours to press one suit and one business shirt.  3. The breakfast buffet was a meeting point for all the local flies.  4. No-one answers the phone.    The positives;  1. They corrected point 1 very quickly.  2. Some of the staff are excellent. Especially on the Front Desk although they don't seem to waste time to answer the phone. And the team in the flyzone breakfast restaurant try hard.  3. The fountain outside.,Date of stay: November 2012,Trip type: Traveled on business,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Qianloong
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,pip1945 wrote a review Nov 2012,30,A Lovely Hotel Spoilt by Poor Service,Having read the comments here prior to travelling I was not quite sure what to expect; opinions seemed to vary considerably. Let's be clear this is a quality hotel - excellent facilities lovely ambiance very good and spacious rooms and well above average food. However the service was most diappointing. Check in and out was laboured; I'm sorry but I don't want to sit in a foyer for half an hour after a long and tiring journey with lots of apparently busy staff rushing around with seemingly little purpose. The service in the restaurants was seriouly poor. Don't misunderstand me; there were plenty of reasonably polite staff around who were either in animated discussion with another member of staff or doing I simply know not what - not serving us for sure! I really don't expect to have to wait 15 minutes for a pot of coffee and asking for it several times. Perversely on our last morning there was a head waiter to greet us at breakfast and within a very few minutes our party had everything we wanted. Wow! What a difference! I will conclude these remarks by saying that with a few notable exceptions the staff lacked warmth.    This is an excellent hotel in many many respects but speaking for myself I would forgo some quality for quicker more efficient and friendlier service. Good management could put my criticisms right in a few weeks,Date of stay: November 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,britsol,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pip1945

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Miss_Snooty wrote a review Oct 2012,40,Beautiful,The frontage and foyer to this hotel aptly named as the Imperial Palace are both stunning and I got a thrill from walking in and out every day. The check-in was a little slow and I wasn't given clear directions to my room which meant I quickly got lost but at least this gave me a chance to appreciate the immense size of this place. The location of the hotel is excellent too - only 8 minutes bus ride from the Airport (when arriving) as the driver dropped me off before the fountain at Bab J'did. A single bus fare costs 30dh (about ¬£2.10) but Airport Transfers are available from the hotel for ‚Ç¨25. This would save the elderly infirm or precious rich people from walking with their suitcases for 5 minutes.  My room was at the budget end of the scale and although a little dated in decor was adequate for my needs. There wasn't much light in the evening unfortunately and the lamps were fixtures which were not conducive to reading or popping in my suitcase. Also my room faced the very noisy nightclub opposite (the Jad Mahal?). It was extremely noisy at night particular Sat night/Sun morning when at 5am there was a feeding frenzy of taxis all vying for drunk passengers.  The pool areas were lovely with plenty of towels and places to lounge. Service and food in the Orangerie were both very good and I didn't realise that there was a terrace there which was unfortunately fully booked the night I chose to eat in You could find better/cheaper dining options but this was convenient for me on one night. I didn't opt for breakfast (240dh/¬£¬£17) as Extrablatt (from 39dh) was ideal for my requirements. It is less than 5 minutes walk away and is excellent. The gym is adequate but the spa treatments way over priced. 1000 Dh for 50 mins massage? The average WEEKLY wage in Morocco is only 750Dh......think about it.,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled solo,France,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Miss_Snooty

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,ehtravelabroad wrote a review Oct 2012,30,A Disappointing Change within range of all the perfect bits of Marrakech,We went to stay in the Sofitel Imperial as it was a cheaper alternative to other hotels we had stayed at such as La Mamounia. We had booked in the Imperial rather than the Lounge as it seemed more modern from a recent renovation and thus had a slightly higher price. We had booked two rooms one with two beds in it however were pleased to be presented with two upgrades to junior suites. The suites were quite small compared to other leading 5 star resorts it was not as luxurious as expected and it turned out that the room didn't have two beds and it could not be arranged either. The rooms took well over the allotted time to be ready with its cleaning and we ended up being admitted to the rooms over 2 hours after the reception had promised - be careful with them. We tried to change one of the rooms into the original two beds standard room only to find that they had already rented out our allotted rooms leaving us with no choice but to stay in the junior suites. The suites were quite small and the TV and other electronics were basic and suggested that they only wanted us to be in the room for sleeping. The decor of the hotel was wonderful and the pool was also the decor of the rooms was dark miserable and quite frankly terrible. The room had a very dark feel with very little light for the night time as well as natural day time light however the balcony was satisfactory. The restaurants were average however not worth the price - one can find much better food elsewhere in Marrakech. The pool area was nice the pool if not a touch cold. The hotel was situated in very small grounds and everyday we had to take a taxi ride away to play either golf or tennis of which we did in the new and quite incredible (however for us fully booked with a corporate event) 4 Seasons. Overall it seemed a good financial choice with lots of places within reach however presented itself with quite a few problems later on. The service was generally good however many tend to ignore you and wonder around the hotel on their breaks smoking.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,PaulyC1966 wrote a review Oct 2012,50,"Sofitel Marrakech is an excellent Arabic, French experience, luxurious in easy reach of local culture",We had a slight issue with our room when we first arrived but the General Manager Hamed and his team did all that they could to resolve the issue which they accomplished and I can now see that Sofitel Marrakech is worthy of all of the great reviews that it gets.  There are some excellent staff from Fatima who serviced our room and made a real effort for my wife's birthday to the concierge who booked us into some fantastic restaurants from traditional Moroccan (Palais Solemain) to modern Buddah Bar type restaurants (Bo Zin & Lotus Club).  The team at Sofitel put on a welcome night on Monday night and it was a great way to meet the staff and other guests in a friendly informal atmosphere. One of the managers Yassin sang a few songs and it is worth going just to hear that; he was excellent!!  The pool staff (particularly Jumal the life guard) were all very helpful and could not do enough to make your stay comfortable.  School boy French is definitely beneficial because many staff and locals do not have a great command of English.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,LadysmithJack wrote a review Oct 2012,40,Anglo Saxon expectations in a Francophone world.....,Look this is a really nice hotel very well located nicely appointed a varied offering of different restaurants and bars The pool area is particular good offering two separate pools and a mix of spaces that break up the area so you don't feel like a bunch of tourists trying to secure your own little bit of territory in a crowded world.    I have eaten here two nights and the food in the Orangey Restaurant like the service has been top notch    I write this from the external bar of the So nightclub/restaurant having just pointed out on Facebook that my night cap is being nursed as some 'young un's are just going out.    Bedrooms. I am in a very tidy room with views South to the Atlas Mountains. Well appointed and boast the Sofitel 'my bed' with its under duvet which makes for a really comfortable sleep.    I have no problem recommending the hotel it offers a real quality experience that is probably a lot better value than other brands with more of a North American heritage.    If you come here and you are Anglo Saxon in temperament and I include my American and Canadian cousins you just have to accept the pace of service and attention to detail is different not wrong but different. So don't always expect staff to fall over to serve you. Test understanding of what you have asked for.... This is true for the whole of Marrakech and try and find a degree of patience - The West End of London or downtown Manhattan this is not.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,mmxbreaks wrote a review Sep 2012,40,African escape with European comforts... but pricey!,"Pros: Two nice outdoor pools comfy bed huge room extensive breakfast ideal location away from the ""mayhem"" of the markets but still within walkable distance staff are great with kids (not that we had any with us) when I got ill a doctor was called to my room within 30mins  Cons: Drinks were stupidly expensive no ""adult only"" pool area not really much of a view (despite paying out for ""mountain view"") shower pressure/temperature a little unpredictable    If you've always wanted to visit Marrakech or the wider realms of the desert then a lot of the centrally based hotels - while lovely from what I've seen - just can't match up to the Sofitel in terms of location or grandeur.  The room we had was the size of my London two bed flat. It was massive more like two rooms than one. The bed was comfy everything was clean the balcony was lovely and the only minor blip I can almost moan about - and this is at a push - is that the shower temperature occassionally drifted from hot to cold unexpectedly. Hardly something to call the police about.  The swimming pools too are both huge - far larger than what you'll find elsewhere nearby except possibly in the northern ""golfers paradise"" part of the town. For my money though that's just too far away. This Sofitel on the other hand is situated far enough away from the madness of the market square for it to feel chilled out and relaxed but close enough to easily walk in and experience some of the other sights and culture. Or use it as a base to get collected by a tour guide and go explore the mountains or elsewhere.  It was after eating something dodgy however (nothing to do with this hotel though it was something from outside) that I got ill. The staff were excellent in calling a doctor to my room. He was here within 30mins checked for apendicitis confirmed my gastroentiritis gave me a bunch of pills to put it right and dull the pain and all that cost a mere ¬£40.  The only reason this property doesn't score five stars is down to the other prices. The rooms are expensive but I accept that. I'm talking around ¬£7 for a small bottle of beer which considering this is Marrakech in Africa that we're talking about is just grossly overpriced. The staff are a little slow in service too.  I like to lounge about on holiday and have a few bottles but after the two of us had drunk about four each (that's only two pints) we had a bill that was around ¬£55. More than it cost to put my health right as outlined above.  Very few bad words to say about this one though.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Nicetocomehome wrote a review Sep 2012,40,Relaxing hotel in a good position,My wife and I have just returned from seven days at the Sofitel Palais Imperial. After a miserable summer in the UK our holiday was primarily to spend long hot days doing nothing other than sit peacefully by a swimming pool reading and swimming and the evenings trying out the local restaurants and wandering around the souks. The Sofitel met all our requirements perfectly. Its situation midway between the Medina and the airport is ideal. The airport transfer by taxi is quick and easy and it is only a twenty minute stroll to the chaos of the Jemaa El Fna and souks.    There are two swimming pools one more lively than the other but both surrounded by gardens and trees giving a real sense of space in an otherwise built up area. There were always sufficient sunbeds available for everyone which avoided the need for guests to place their towel on ‚Äòtheir‚Äô bed early in the morning. This allowed us to enjoy long and relaxing breakfasts on the outdoor patio each morning. All very civilised.    Our Junior Suite a hike to a far wing of the hotel was decorated in Moroccan style. The air conditioning was very efficient the bathroom had a bath and a shower but the highest marks go for the bed which must be the most comfortable I can remember in any hotel for a long time. After an evening wandering around the souks it was something we could really looked forward returning to and had difficulty getting out of in the morning. The room was on the ground floor with no real view which at first was disappointing. But it backed on to the garden and allowed us to come and go from room to pool very easily and without having to traipse through the hotel or catch a lift as there was no toilet or shower in the grounds. Something the management may wish to consider.    Finally a word in praise of the staff. Everyone was extremely helpful and friendly from first arrival until departure. There is a sense of sycophancy and of trying too hard to please which can at times feel over-formal and overbearing. But step forward Ydrys who met all our breakfast demands cheerfully and efficiently.    We would willingly stay at the Sofitel again and I would recommend it for anyone looking for somewhere to relax in Marrakech.,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nicetocomehome

The decor is detailed and interesting and the rooms are like small apartments with amazing airconditioning. The spa is also world class.    The service however isn't consistent. The concierge requires cash advance payments for excursions? Is that normal? At the pool one of the employees basically threw towels on the chairs for us maybe we asked the wrong person for towels? Our waiter was amazing and willing to go into town to get batteries loved that.    Which brings me to another point there is absolutely no place in the hotel or nearby to get items like aspirin batteries ect. That along with the language barrier takes away from the experience.

Great hotel in a good position in a safe upmarket area of marraketch  close to restaurants  up market shops Louis Vitton etc.  This hotel is side by side with the lounge and spa. Both hotels have a different feel  lounge and spa more contemporary and the imperial slightly posher.  Breakfast is expensive at 24 euros and not worth it unless it is included in your holiday. There is an excellent cafe 100 yds from hotel which is great fro breakfast or lunch and dinner if you wish.  Drinks are very expensive at the hotel with a bottle of beer costing 80 dr about ¬£6 and water costing the same.  You do get water each day given free in the hotel room minibar is expensive. Hotel has a great gym included for free but massage and cleansing is charged out at a high price.  Taxis are cheap 20dr to the city square to buy you souvenirs. Horse and cart also reasonable.  Hotel rooms are smart with good showers and balconies looking onto pool or gardens...  Hotel has three restaurants  but very expensive better to go out and find a nice restaurant for moroccean food.

If you are looking for a Riad and want to compare this to a Riad it is an unfair comparison. This is a large modern hotel run like a modern hotel - not a small Riad or boutique exprience at all. It's location just outside the city wall is conveninet but a major road runs at the back of the property and traffic noise is prelevant.    We had a ""Junior Suite"" and I believe there are 2 levels of room below this - I would not like to be in either of them as I would class our room as adequate for this claa of hotel - nothing more. This is one area I would class as 4 star. WE had a balcony over looking the pool and city wall abd it has a mini bar small seating area etc but the bathroom is small the shower glass divider allows water all over the floor and the showe is over the tub. Barely 4 star in my book. There is a separate toilet and bidet that helps but this is a dated design and cramped. Room carpet worn and stained walls thin enough to hear neighbours TV.    The areas of the hotel that stand out are: The 2 pools - definitely 5 star large with masses of quality loungers & large bed like seating areas plenty of towels parasols and staff to manage. Never had an issue getting a space and the staff worked hard to try and please everyone. There are 2 outside bars and one luncheon area with severl waiters taking drink orders etc. The only thing I would change is to make the smaller pool adult only - nothing worse than enjoying a cocktail by the pool but having to listen to screaming kids that have no adult supervision. The larger pool is where that should be.    Restaurants and bars: well run and nice cocktails. Had dinner one night in the Orangerie and it was at best rather middle of the road - plenty of good alternatives elsewhere thank you. The breakfast spread is impresive and if you like a full breakfast then worth the $30/head. However we are more coffee and croissant folks and on our first visit I was handed a $60/bill - I protested and they cut it in half but not wanting to have an argument every morning we just skipped breakfast - they should have an easy continental option of juice/breads & coffee. Again there are alternatives nearby.    Staff: We found the staff very accomodating polite and with a generally good attitude. Sometimes they are a bit stretched at peak times around the pool but generally good. Check in was easy changing money was easy and housekeeping good. Having read the reports of the concierge we booked 2 trips directly with a tour company to the Atlas Mountains and Essouira but they did arrange a guide for the old town and gave some recommendations for dinner that mostly worked out - one was a bust. So while I can see that they have their schemes they did not put us wrong. One last comment on staff was that we extended our check out until 3PM as I had a case of ""Marrakesh Express"" and that was appreciated - I had to push a little for it but it was nice of them as the hotel was very full.    All in all a decent experience - not a cultural experience but if you want a western hotel type stay then this will deliver that combined with the great pool area makes it a decent alternative.",Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Eureka Springs, Arkansas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LiamBuckley
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Quinonostante wrote a review Jul 2012,30,Beautiful but soulless...,Indeed an grand looking building attached directly to the sister hotel 'Le Medina' and having spent several days in Essouira enjoying Soifel service I had high expectations of this hotel.    Check in is quite unpleasant - and confusing.    Taken around a myriad of corridors to a rather pleasant room not the 'double' I booked because apparently there are no double deluxe rooms only twins (be aware)!    Pool view room was really a tree view room with a balcony which couldn't be locked..an engineer had to be called.    Similarly the air conditioning is poor.    When we commented to guest services they offered to zip up the beds to make a double and give us a complementary lunch...we never got the lunch!!!!    Beds comfy and room quiet but very badly lit no shaving light or mirror for example.    Breakfast was plentiful well presented and service immaculate.    Pool areas are possibly the best feature here plenty of lounging areas and two pools. Very clean too.    A five star? When I compare it to New York or London - the building may well be five star but reception experience is soulless and not welcoming.    Not the jewel in The Sofitel crown by a long shot.,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"North East England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Quinonostante

Whilst this place presents itself well for a large hotel scratch the surface and the service s really poor. On arrival we were kept waiting for ages to check in despite being whisked into the 'quick' you have a reservation area! Aircon in the rooms works well but in other areas of the hotel it is poor.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Mahaguru wrote a review Jun 2012,40,Great BUT Mohamed is RIGHT about Concierge,"Warning! Family travel perspective here: GREAT hotel and facilities. Perfect place to come back to after tourism. Perfect garden to hang out in. Genious pool/garden in fact. Breakfast and lunch buffets are truly excellent. We had a truly great hotel experience in that Madame got her retail therapy son got a bit of culture-shock but had the most fabulous pool to return to and yours truly enjoyed himself thoroughly. We booked in here due to the recommendation of Italian friends who moved out of three bad hotels/riads before finding peace at the sofitel. I hesitated before booking the big hotel chain but very happy I did.  THE UGLY: The Concierge is crooked (surprise!). We were subjected to an attempted ripoff after booking a ""tour"" with the concierge. Having none of it we returned to the hotel and demanded an immediate audience with hizzoner the manager. The chief concierge came running of course - he'd been updated by the aspiring thugs I imagine; offered us just about everything the hotel had to offer to make us forget about it (and the scamming would go on and on). Sadly for him he picked the wrong people to offer freebies to. He melted away once a very nice and professional executive assistant arrived. She seemed genuinely bothered but then the big dog arrived. He slid into and half off the couch before lighting up the 100W smile. He COULD have cared less. Sofitel is a big franchise. The Palais Royal is the perfect spot for a family and many others (I suspect) given it's features. The staff is overall very good. I am just really bothered by the concierges and the manager who seemed to think way too highly of himself. The assistant on the other hand stayed on our case and made sure we enjoyed ourselves for the rest of the stay. If I return to Marrakesh I will most certainly have the Sofitel at the top of my list (but I'll do my tourism business elsewhere thankyouverymuch)",Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,Bermuda,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mahaguru

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,TravellingDudeMan wrote a review May 2012,40,"Top notch rooms, service and hotel - for a price.",We recently stayed at the Sofitel in Marrakech for the second leg of our honeymoon.    We had the option of staying at a riad for our visit but opted for a bit more luxury and the more 'traditional' hotel experience. We are happy we did.    The Sofitel is located in the Hivernage neighborhood of Marrakech. This is the 'upscale' neighborhood of the city - you won't find the hustle and bustle of the square of the souqs here - rather you'll find traffic lights cars following the rules of the road multi-million dollar homes high end fashion boutiques and high end hotel chains.    The hotel is situated about 10 minutes by taxi from the airport. Expect to pay about 150 dirhams for the trip. By foot you can reach the Djemaa El Fna (the square) in about 15 minutes or via a 5 minute taxi ride. Be careful if by foot getting through the traffic in the roundabouts!    First impression of the hotel is simply opulence. It is big it is expensive looking and it screams 'luxury'. I think they must own over 10000 pillows. There are outdoor sofas everywhere beautiful furnishings and decorations and upon entering the hotel you're entranced by a wonderful scent of orange blossoms and perfume.    Check in is painless but somewhat slow. You sit in a lounge area and are treated to a cold cloth to wash your face and sweet mint tea. Then you fill out forms. And more forms. Finally you get your room!    We had a standard king room. Think your regular style hotel room but with 'Moroccan' touches here and there and you wouldn't be far off. Not a lot of storage room but livable. The balcony is a place you'll want to spend some time on - another outdoor couch with pillows and a wonderful garden view. Others will be able to see the Atlas Mountains. Will depend on what side you are on.    The bathroom is straightforward large and well finished. My personal pet peeve with all European style bathrooms is showers with half doors but I can't fault the Sofitel for this. Bathroom soaps are L'Occitane. I'm told this is good.    The unabashed star of the room however is the bed. Oh what a bed. Feathery soft wonderful sleep inducing comfort. A bed that will make you want to spend all day in it. One of the best beds I've ever slept in!    Note for others - you may want to check the connecting door of your room if you have an adjoining hotel room. We found ours open on arrival and it was quite a pain to close properly. As there is no lock on the door (!!!) it needs to be closed completely and tightly or else your neighbors can have full access to your stuff if you're not careful!    We had a couple of opportunities to use other hotel services.    Lunch was had by the hotel pool on our arrival. Fairly tasty kefta and Moroccan salads but hideously overpriced for what we got.    We also had the breakfast buffet 2 days - although very expensive at 250 dirhams each it was fabulous quality and quantity with just about anything you'd want - smoothies eggs meat cheese breads and the most fantastic croissants and pain de chocolat we've ever had.    Lastly we visited the on site spa after deciding against a traditional hammam. Although more expensive it was exactly what we were looking for with a half hour facial massage and a half hour back massage. We followed this with a jacuzzi and a solid hour in the spectacular on site heated pool at the spa in the basement. Pure bliss! A wonderful touch afterwards was the spa manager treating my wife to a complimentary bottle of body mist for our honeymoon and also giving us the jacuzzi compliments of the hotel.    The Sofitel was exactly what we were looking for however do keep in mind that the luxury comes with a price so you should expect to pay at least 40% more for anything you get through the hotel. All avoidable however what's the point of staying at a hotel like this if you don't splurge a bit too?    Next time we'd stay at a riad just for the experience but don't be afraid to try the Sofitel Marrakech out if you want opulent luxury!,Date of stay: May 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Toronto, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellingDudeMan

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,EastCoastGuy357 wrote a review Apr 2012,40,"Rough start, but great ending....","After a very long trip from Boston via Paris I finally arrived at the beautiful Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial. When anyone is ""traveled out"" the last thing they want is a dirty noisy room. I began looking around the standard room I had booked. On initial inspection of the room I found dirty hair in the bath tub and the mini-bar open and half stocked. Also the new U.S. Ambassador to Morocco and his entourage were staying at the hotel which was causing quite a lot of noise in the hallways. I notified the front desk and was taken to another room in this immense hotel. This time I asked the front desk person to stay with me until I had taken a look at the room. Worse than the first room....The sheets and tub were filthy. Something I had experienced in a Motel 6 in Memphis but not the kind of housekeeping that I'm used to at a Sofitel. By this time my jet lag had kicked in and I was not happy. The front desk manager arrived. I was taken to another wing of the hotel. It was a huge suite. I checked out the cleanliness thanked them and fell into a deep sleep. When I woke up I opened the curtains to a huge balcony and an unbelievable view of the Atlas Mountains ! I ordered room service and savored the view over my espresso and croissants. The grounds and multiple pools were immaculate more than I could say about the first two rooms that I had nearly forgotten about...The suite was one of the most beautiful I had ever experienced ! Pink roses in multiple vases and exotic carpets and draperies adorned the room. I went down to the front desk to thank the Manager from the previous night for the great upgrade. I don't suggest that anyone immediately begins complaining about their rooms in order to get an upgrade but room cleanliness is paramount. The rest of my ""Birthday"" trip was wonderful ! The Hotel staff became my friends after I suggested to a very rude cigar smoking French business man who was tearing the front desk staff apart to take a hotel down the street if he didn't like this Sofitel. I returned to my room and was surprised by a beautiful fruit and date basket and a complimentary dinner voucher for putting the rude guy in his place. The chicken tangine dinner and red wine from the vineyards of the Atlas Mountains was superb. When I checked out most of the staff that I had interacted with was there to personally wish me ""Bon voyage"".

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Dr Andy S L wrote a review Apr 2012,50,One of the best places to stay in exotic Marrakech!,We began our 2 week adventure in beautiful Morocco at the luxury Sofitel Marrakech. We booked a suite online and received a special offer of 33% off by prepaying before arrival (no change/cancellation allowed). The hotel is reasonably new and very fresh and elegant. Outside and in the architects and designers paid heed to traditional and cultural sensitivity. It resembles a traditional Moroccan palace.  Our suite was spacious and extremely comfortable and spotlessly clean. The bed was heaven. Anyone will sleep like a baby. The bathroom had all the most modern fittings. Free wi fi was included. There is a fantastic pool and enormous deck in the back which we didn't use. Also didn't have time for the fitness facility. We got a free cocktail which we enjoyed in the lovely outdoor bar.  Unfortunately breakfast buffet was expensive and not included. Each morning we walked less than 100m down the road to a neighbouring hotel where it offered a tremendous a la carte breakfast for a song. With so many fine dining options in Marrakech we did not have a chance to use the hotel restaurants either.  The hotel is just on the edge of the Medina though it is a good 20 minutes walk to the world famous Djemaa el Fna the heart and symbol of this wonderful city. For us the Sofitel was perfect. I found the medina very touristy congested noisy and at times unclean. So it was nice to be able to see it at our leisure and then retire for the night at a safe quiet and very upscale section of town.  The Sofitel is also only 20 minutes walk from the New Town built by the French 50 years ago. Though it is no where as interesting as the medina it is still worth spending half a day here for a look at the difference. Another big bonus is a Europcar rental desk on site and as we needed a vehicle to continue our tour of Morocco after checkout this feature was a huge convenience for us.  It is relatively expensive for relatively inexpensive Morocco but by choosing the Sofitel you will be choosing a very classy upscale establishment.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Walkers5 wrote a review Apr 2012,50,A jewel in Marrakech.,We traveled to Morocco with our three children and this hotel was one of the highlights. Situated perfectly in the city of Marrakech we walked or secured a car through the concierge to all the sites we wanted to see. The medina is within walking distance as are some wonderful resteraunts. We never felt unsafe walking in this area. The pool is fabulous and the service fabulous. The younger kids spent a great deal of time using their pedal carts and course in the front of the hotel. wouldn't seem like a big draw but they had a ball. The rooms were wonderful an I would definitely suggest the suites that overlook the pool. There had been reviews that i had read that the service was not helpful. I speak very minimal french and the rest of my family none but we never had an issue nor anything other than other the top service. Their concierge service was excellent.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Global LuxuryTraveller wrote a review Apr 2012,30,Some good Some Bad.....,We stayed in a suite - room was very noisy because the floor was part Tiled and footsteps below and above could be heard as well as some muffled conversations and doors closing etc. The Hotel was very busy - the staff helpful and the Breakfast although expensive was very good. The rooms also only had 1 toliet for a 2 bedroom suite which was a little inconvenient when travelling with children - the rooms were fairly basic and looked 'tired' None of the windows or Doors shut properly so noise could be heard even several floors up from the pool area and outside seating areaswith not in our opinion 5 star decoration (despite Bose sound systems) and the rooms being dark too we were disappointed in the level of luxury (no cushions on any sofas or chairs ? ) for what we paid for a suite (rack rate was ¬£600 we got this discounted prior to arrival on a web deal). We thought the choice - of in hotel eating was limited and a 3 person dinner with 1 course each and 4 drinks came to ¬£ 100 for very average food. There are charges for the steam Hamman which is okay (250 dirhams) indoor pool nice - The Pools are laid out (trendy style like Hotel Costes look alike with red cushions everywhere outside) but the seating is not that comfortable and quite cramped - and very close to the rest of the hotel eg not peace and quiet if thats what you are looking for ....The hotel was extremely busy and bustling and people hang around outside the hotel and hassle you as you walk out - the hotel staff do nothing to stop these intrusions (Ferraris and Mercs parked at the back of the hotel so lots of wealthy local guests - all the top of the range cars had local number plates ) we got the impression that the hotel was somewhat complacent - value for money we wont be returning and when we got to the hotel we were shocked that the pool photos have been somewhat expertly taken - eg giving a very generous impression of size.and situation...that said the Hotel has lots of good reviews so may be we just had a one off bad experience - Hope this helps however.,Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,Europe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel6Star
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Dakers86 wrote a review Apr 2012,50,A fantastic birthday break!,Absolutely fantastic hotel that we couldnt fault in anyway! Staff were fabulously helpful and attentive. We went in April which didnt seem the busiest of times so we had no problems with finding a 'bed' by the pool! Towels were provided by the hotel and placed onto your bed by the pool attendants.    We stayed in a Junior Suite and had the most amazing view from our balcony of the 2 pool areas and the Atlas Mountains in the distance. Absolutely beautiful view to wake up to each morning! We had a few 'dull rainy days' whilst we were there but we happy enough on the balcony looking out at the rain and the mountains as one visit to the old town and souks was more than enough. We were more than happy to be self contained within the hotel during the day.    We had a meal at l'Orangerie and So Restaurant both in the hotel and could not fault either of them... worked out at the same price as going to a very nice restaurant at home for a 3 course meal and plenty of wine / cocktails! The breakfast was a buffet style with both continental and cooked options this proved to be a little too expensive for what it was - ¬£25 per person no matter what you ate was too much. Luckily the supermarket at the end of the road provided our continental breakfast on the balcony!    Very good location for both the old and new towns with other restaurtants situated near by (which are less expensive as the hotel ones and just as nice!)    We didnt use the spa whilst we were there but we did make full use of both pools and jacuzzi outside... one warm pool which attracted the children and another colder one which was an absolute godsend in the heat of the midday sun - iive never felt so refreshed!!

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,JNSB14 wrote a review Apr 2012,40,Nice hotel in a great location,"The hotel is in a great location just outside the medina wall and a gentle 10 minute stroll into the central square.  The rooms are very comfortable and well serviced with the only draw backs in ours being a shower that simply flooded the bathroom every time we used it and and the air-conditioning was almost useless (this despite requests to fix it) it was just as well that the weather was not too warm.  Breakfast was excellent with a huge range of dishes and an attentive staff most of the time. We didn't eat in the hotel other than breakfast but the concierge recommended a riad for dinner one evening which was a wonderful experience.  Just a comment on service. It took us 45 minutes to check in as you are required to sit in the lobby while they serve you mint tea and they bring the registration forms to you. It didn't seem particularly busy but there were only two staff working with the others ( I assume managers - I called them ""the suits"" and during check in I counted five of them at one point) simply standing around or talking on their mobiles. The same thing happens in the bar in the evening; lots of ""suits"" wandering around and a couple of hard pressed waiters trying to keep up with the flow of orders.  One thing to look out for is the approach of what I am sure are ""touts"" as you head into the medina from the hotel. On two separate occasions as we left the hotel and turned to walk towards the gate into the old city a man stopped beside us as we waited to cross the road. He asked if we ""were staying at the Sofitel"" and when we confirmed it he claimed to work there had just finished his shift and as his way home passed through the square he would show us the way (different men but same story on the two occasions). We responded pleasantly and they walked alongside us. As we approached the centre they offered to show us a good restaurant and some of the sights away from the square. We politely declined but they persisted and in the end we simply thanked them and walked away without looking back. My guess is that they ""target"" those that are staying in the better hotels and walk you into the chosen restaurants etc. No threat and easily concluded without to much hassle but a bit distracting.  Marrakesh is a wonderful vibrant city with friendly people and loads of restaurants and bars; the Sofitel is a great place to stay if you want a central base to explore from.",Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Letchworth Garden City, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JNSB14
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,LeeGinLondon wrote a review Apr 2012,20,"Beautiful Hotel, Horrendous Service",I so wanted to love this hotel it's beautiful and we were off to a rip-roaring start when we pulled up after our 2 1/2 hour drive from Essaouira with our three young boys and they had a bicycle go-kart course which they loved. Sadly the came up against experience after experience of tragically bad service while we were there. We spent only one night as we were flying back to London the next morning. Our first issue arose from trying to get a crib for our room which we requested at the time that we made the reservation.... and again on arrival.... and again when we brought our sleeping one-year old back to the room after dinner at L'Orangerie in the hotel.... and again an hour after that. During that saga we dined at L'Orangerie which we had booked on arrival however when we arrived they did not seem to have any record of our booking. We had to ask for water for our children four times before we were able to have it served to the table. We attempted to gain internet access both from our rooms and the lobby of the hotel but the connection was so dreadfully slow that we were unable to download a single e-mail. The next morning when we arrived at breakfast at 7am we were never offered coffee or tea and had to track someone down to get it after we had finished eating. We then proceeded to the hotel lobby to find that our airport car reservation which we had also made through the hotel could not be located. They finally obtained a car service for us however we nearly missed checking in to our flight due to the hour that it took for us to find a replacement car. And all of this for US$700 excluding our meal at L'Orangerie (which was very tasty I might add).

We are definitely sure that the very expensive golden pearl necklace with platinum was on the desk when we left. We are given the answer of no by the staff even we asked them to check and ask the cleaning staff again. The only thing we can do now is to tell this true story here. I hope the manager could see this and check this again. This is a behavior of stealing to some extent!

The swimming pools are fantastic so is the service that is offered by the attendants. The reception & concierge staff will make you feel at home and anticipate most of your needs. The only minior disappointment was the noise from the street below if you have a room on the east wing of the Hotel. Every morning at around 3 am local moroccan partygoers leaving a local club are very noisy thus disturbing your sleep.,Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndrewEC1

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,JeromeMarrel wrote a review Jan 2012,40,a nice hotel just outside the city walls,Sofitel is a good brand and the Palais Imperial is of the Sofitel standard. Although the rooms are a bit small they are well appointed with an outdoor balcony or terrace near the pool.  Amazing buffets for breakfast and lunch which allows you to taste the local fare as well as the French culinary heritage.  The property is large so expect a good 5 minutes walk to the far rooms. But once inside peace and quiet everywhere.  Nice and helpfull staff quick check in and perfect housekeeping.,Date of stay: March 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Goa, India",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeromeMarrel
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Tony A wrote a review Jan 2012,50,Excellent Hotel with Great Facilities and Friendly Staff,"We have just returned from a weekend trip to Marrakesh. We travelled with Thomson and stayed at the Sofitel Imperial Palais in the city. The flight was usual fare but with no complaints.  Arrival in Marrakesh was smooth (when you walk out of the airport - look up - the airport canopy is beautiful architecture). You need to get some money out at the airport and find somewhere to change it into smaller coins. This is because you will need a 10 Dirham coin (about 70p) to tip the transfer taxi driver (even if you have paid for airport transfers). You will also need another to tip the porters (In fact it is worthwhile keeping a few on you at all times because everyone wants tips.    The hotel is lovely and although it is outside the city walls in Hivernage this is the 'posh' end of town and it is literally five minutes walk through the city walls and back into the city. The area is safe - we saw no trouble and there are some uniformed police but also many plain clothed police around.    There are two large outdoor pools (which were a bit chilly in January) but there were people in them. The sunbeds are amazing - double beds towels provided cushions tables. Really confy and plenty of them. There is also an indoor pool and steam room.    There is an onsite nightclub called the ""So Bar"" which was brilliant. The food was amazing and the band that was on were great - including the two giddiest girls dancing you could ever see. Sadly it was their last night of a winter tour but well worth a visit all the same.    Marrakech is a fantastic place for a short visit but I would not recommend taking young children unless they are very young (i.e. in a buggy) or old enough to find their own way back to the hotel after getting lost - you will loose them. In fact you are likely to loose each other if you go into the souks (markets).    If you do go into the souks be prepared. It is manic. Firstly you will get lost. If you see something you like buy it then you will never find that shop again! If you do get lost just ask someone the way out - everyone except you seems to know! The souks are by far the cheapest place to buy things but you do have to barter. We got our stuff for about a third to a half of the first price quoted but you can probably get them down further if you can be bother. Evenso the same products were double that in the shops and at least trebble in the airport.    It is very safe except for one thing - the traffic!!! Sadly when the Marrakeshi's ousted the French they decided to keep their approach to traffic. Do not hire a car to drive around the city you will die!. Plus it only costs a maximum of about ¬£2.50 (30 Dirhams) to get anywhere in the city by taxi. As a pedestrian do not be fooled by what look like zebra crossings painted on the road or traffic lights - no-one (except the busses) takes any notice of them unless a policeman is stood there.    When crossing the road look left right in front behind up and down before stepping out. Thankfully all of the mopeds (and there are thousands of them) make an horrendous noise so you will hear them coming you just won't be sure fron which direction. They expect YOU to move out of their way - they don't swerve they just come straight at you. It is very scarry - particularly in the main square.    Back to the hotel all of the staff are lovely and very helpful. They all greet you with Bonjour or Bon Soir. They appreciate it when you reciprocate but that is the limit of the French you will need in this city almost everyone spoke English.    We hope you enjoy it.",Date of stay: January 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Manchester, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyA724
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Eric L wrote a review Jan 2012,50,Marrakech in early January 2011,I had always dreamt of visiting Marrakech in January Winston Churchill's favourite winter destination. We were delighted to discover how convenient and well-appointed the Sofitel Palais Imperial is. All the attractions of the Old Town are within walking distance and we were extremely well looked after. The outdoor swimming pools are spacious and warm and we basked in glorious sunshine during the whole five days of our trip.  The bedroom suites are magnificently spacious and well decorated in the local style but not at all garish. Excellent service. Courteous reception. Good food in the two hotel restaurants.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,ENTP wrote a review Jan 2012,40,Opulent and reassuringly international,Sofitel a French company is playing to the home crowd here at Hivernage the verdant smart suburb of Marrakech where international hotels and designer boutiques rub shoulders just a short walk from the fragrant chaos of the Medina. Staying at the Sofitel brings with it the usual benefits: one can't help but be impressed by the swaying palms soaring fountains and acres of marble that grace the public spaces. The bedrooms are an appealing if predictable mix of ample space fine cotton and Hermes amenities. Breakfast is a vast affair replete with both hot and cold buffets juice bar omelette station and Viennoisserie that clearly passes muster with the largely French clientele. Although this visit was in the height of winter it's easy to imagine whiling away a summer afternoon beside one of the glorious swimming pools that cleverly weave their way amongst the palms. And if you've forgotten a handbag or heels Loius Vuitton is just up the road.  It is however at one remove from what makes Marrakech unique. Riads and ancient souks are pretty thin on the ground in London Paris or Rome and if you're making the journey to Morocco then I'd recommend staying a little closer to the action. It is also difficult to create something truly international in a city in which the majority of the inhabitants still live in relative poverty. Although the Sofitel has staff in abundance most are willing rather than skilled and the service is deliberate rather than efficient. We had to ask three times for an ironing board and twice for more shampoo. In a similar vein the restaurant is good (but one can eat better for much much less 15 minutes down the road) and the spa is a delight (but 25 EUR to use the thalassotherapy pool is extortionate given the rack rate).  None of which makes the Sofitel Marrakech a bad choice. On the contrary if you're not on a budget and you want the warm glow of movie star treatment in a grand hotel then you can do much worse. It's just not very 'Marrakech'.,Date of stay: December 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Oxford,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ENTP
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,C-MACTofino wrote a review Nov 2011,50,Like Coming Home,"I stayed at the Sofitel last year on an extremely rushed business trip. This year I added a couple of days on either end of my meetings and was thrilled to have the opportunity to relax and enjoy this hotel.    Walking in I felt like a returning queen. I was greeted with recognition and by name; the staff seemed genuinely happy to see me back again! The Guest Services Manager welcomed me to tea and the Clefs D'Or Concierge was extremely helpful with suggestions and directions into town.    The hotel is a quick 10 minute walk to the medina and it is easy to get around from its central location. One thing I will mention is if you are in the Sioux for shopping there is a ""Sofitel"" price you pay so it's better to say you are staying in a hostel if asked by a seller.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,MissSurrey wrote a review Nov 2011,50,Fantastic hotel & friendly staff,This is a beautiful 5 star hotel is set about a mile away from the hustle and bustle of the centre of Marrakech. The service was excellent and the staff were extremely friendly polite and helpful. They spoke perfect English.    We pre-arranged a transfer with the hotel from the airport at a cost of 25 Euros. I don‚Äôt think we would have paid much less with a normal taxi from the airport and for the convenience of not having taxi drivers hassle us in the arrivals area it was worth it.    Be warned of local taxi drivers who take you on a tour of Marrakech when all you want to do is go to Djemaa el Fna (as happened to us). The driver was very friendly and chatty then pulled up to a shop switched off the engine and told us this was a great shop to spend time in as the square was not busy yet. We had to be very firm but polite and ask him to take us to the square (‚Äì where it was fairly busy). Our guess was that he was on commission from the shop owner to take gullible tourists there‚Ä¶    The outdoor pools are beautiful and our 18-month-old son loved splashing around especially as they were heated (perfect for October).    The d√©cor is very tasteful and elegant and in the older part of the hotel the photography hanging on the wall could be out of a gallery it was fascinating to look at.    We had a junior suite room with a lovely view of the pools. The room was huge with a hall area lounge bedroom and two bathrooms one with a shower and one with a bath. The staff set up a cot for our son (a proper wooden cot not a travel cot which was a nice surprise). The bed was huge too and very comfortable. The only downside to our room was that the coffee machine didn‚Äôt work and leaked water over the floor when we switched it on. We forgot to mention the problem to the staff though so we can‚Äôt complain as they probably don‚Äôt realise it‚Äôs broken.    The breakfast was vast; a huge choice was available. But it was pricey at 25 Euros per person. The staff at breakfast were particularly very friendly and polite and helped us entertain our son who was trying to get out of his highchair and run around.    The two downsides for us as a family with an 18 month old toddler was that firstly the hotel was not closer to the centre of town to find some family friendly restaurants in the evening. We would have had to take a taxi in the evening into the main area to find a suitable restaurant and with a tired toddler than wasn‚Äôt an option. Although the upside to this ‚Äúproblem‚Äù as I have said is that you are away from the noise and bustle of the city centre. If we were travelling as a couple this wouldn‚Äôt have been an issue at all.    Secondly it would have been a benefit to us again with a toddler to have a family friendly restaurant within the hotel. Difficult to do in a 5 star hotel I assume we ended up eating our dinner in the corner of the hotel bar with our toddler next to us. (It was delicious by the way). This in itself we were grateful for the staff arranging as we should have eaten in the posh restaurant next door to the bar but the staff understood our situation and set two dinner places on the coffee table!    The food was generally expensive within the hotel it is a 5* hotel of course but be prepared to pay a lot for food and drinks.    We used a fantastic private transport company called Travel Link Morocco to take us to the coast after our stay in Marrakech. Admittedly I was concerned about transport the state of the roads safety of the car provided and if they would provide a car seat for our son ‚Äì all of my fears were unfounded the car was a high-class people carrier with a very polite driver who spoke perfect English and our son‚Äôs car sear was very safe. The driver drove very safely and we felt very safe on our journey to the coast. They also do day excursions. Highly recommend.    p.s Hotel provides highchairs in the restaurants but this is not the case when you eat at cafes and restaurants away from the Sofitel. It is worth buying a travel booster seat for those with little children.,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,Surrey,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissSurrey
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,CTheWorld84 wrote a review Oct 2011,50,"Beautiful hotel, nice location and friendly staff","We stayed at the Sofitel for 6 nights during our honeymoon and overall it was a very pleasant experience. Layla who managed and arranged our stay ensured we were given a complimentary upgrade to a room with a balcony and our room was redecorated with rose petals every day which was a really thoughtful touch. If you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city at the end of the day then this is probably one of the best hotels to do so given that it offers all the luxury and facilities of a hotel but is only a 5 minute taxi or 15 minute walk from Jemma El Fna.    There are plenty of facilities offered by the hotel which are worth trying too with the most noteworthy being the ""So Bars"" a collection of three bars offering different experiences; one has a live band singing old and new songs every night which is really good fun and another allows you to sit in an area in the middle of the swimming pool and have tea or do sheesha - contrasting but equally good experiences.    Plus points were:    - View from the balcony was beautiful at day and night  - Close proximity to Medina and Jemma El Fna.  - Beautiful clean hotel  - Friendly and accommodating staff    Negative points:    - Our WC room smelt of cigarette smoke every night so there must have been a vent connected to a smoking room and despite the efforts of housekeeping it didn't go away.  - For some reason housekeeping didn't clean our room on one day despite requests to do so.  - There were some extra charges added to our bill which had nothing to do with anything we had done at the hotel so I'd strongly advise checking the bill carefully.  - Restaurants are expensive.  - The city tour guide organised by the concierge wasn't that great and deliberately delayed time to ensure he got paid extra.",Date of stay: September 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CTheWorld84
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Sun_seeking_ginner wrote a review Oct 2011,40,Most impressive...,I was met at the airport by the shuttle service as arranged its a bit pricey (250 MAD compared 150-200 MAD in a taxi) but the air conditioned Mercedes was a welcome relief after a grueling journey.    I was checked in by friendly and helpful staff and when I double checked to make sure I¬¥d got a non-smoking room they upgraded me to a junior suite at no extra cost. Whether I got the upgrade because I asked for a non smoking room or because I have an Accor Silver card I don¬¥t know. I was offered a drink whist waiting and was sat down whilst I filled in forms etc.    The room was HUGE. Separate lounge area coffee maker (shame I don¬¥t drink the stuff) huge bed two tvs two showers with a huge balcony which unfortunately didn¬¥t get much sun. I have never been upgraded ever before so was a little bit chuffed! The room was a little dark but that meant I slept fantastically and the bathroom and wardrobes both need a little work/upgrading but overall no complaints with my room at all.    The interior and exterior of the hotel are beautiful the pool area especially so with a variety of sun lounges and chairs to choose from and plenty of shade for those that burn easily. I must admit I fell asleep in the shade in one of the extremely comfortable hammocks on my first afternoon! The pools are both a good size and the slightly heated pool made all the difference for my early morning swims! The fitness centre is well equipped but unfortunately the power plate was not plugged in and no plug could be found for it. I went to two of the restaurants L√ìrangerie where I had an excellent tagine whilst being entertained by traditional Moroccan music and dance and I had a salad at L√ìasis on my last day. The service in both was excellent.    The hotel is only a 15 minute walk to Djemaa el fna square so the location is great although the road going past just outside the pool area wall can be a little loud at times.    Staff were very helpful and friendly and I really cannot give enough praise. Yes sometimes their English isn¬¥t great but then the Sofitel is a French hotel chain and Marrakech is a French speaking country so it is to be expected.    I would recommend this hotel especially if you want a little pool time.,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Oslo, Norway",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sun_seeking_ginner
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Denis G wrote a review Sep 2011,10,"Looks great, but ....",We arrived last night. First issue: the reception clerk asked me to sign a pre-authorization credit charge amounting to about twice what my total hotel bill is likely to be. Second Issue: they could not provide a suite with twin beds for our daughters claiming that had not been specified on the reservation. Third Issue: they moved us to the other older building where the rooms are priced cheaper but claimed this was simply a different concept and the price would be the same. Fourth Issue: the air conditioning did not work properly in that second room we had so that after two hours of unsuccessfully waiting for the room to cool we were moved to a third room back in the section we had reserved. Fifth Issue: they claimed they had just moved us to a more expensive section (the section I had reserved and paid for) and would have to charge us more!!!!

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Martyn W wrote a review Aug 2011,30,"great location, nice hotel but won't be back",The hotel is ideally situated for the Medina and to see most parts of the town. The room was a nice size (although felt like a railway carriage as it was long and thin) but was very dark inside. The rooms were very clean. The shower in the bathroom was very poor. For a five star hotel I would have expected better. Bathrooms not clean to the level of detail I would expect from five star hotels. The pool area was nice. Good size swimming pools and nice sunbeds. The service was mixed - some great staff others not interested. The biggest problem was the constant sound of music from the bar. From 7:30 to 0:30 this could be heard in the rooms. When we asked to change rooms on the second occasion we were told the music would be turned down. This never happened. It made sleeping in the evening difficult and I was awoken by the noise. It also meant siestas could not happen. For this reason I would advise against this hotel and not stay there again. Although food prices in five star hotels go with the territory this was exceptionally overpriced. Furthermore considering the price there was no free transportation between the airport and hotel.,Date of stay: August 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Thatcham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MartynW_11

The hotel itself is within walking distance of the Medina and is a very convenient spot to stay in Marrakesh.  A number of the guide books say that you do not need to have a guide to visit the Soukhs and whilst this is certainly true you will see much more by having an official guide (not the ones who hang around the hotels and Medina areas) and this would make the visit even more interesting and enjoyable.,Date of stay: November 2010,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Jersey, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/b00jum

The hotel seems to offer daytime activities for families as we saw a cute little cooking group for children promenading through the restaurant and pool area one afternoon.    There are a lot of nice touches that service seems to distribute randomly: I received a dozen white roses one person in my group received leather hotel slippers many of us received rose petals sprinkled on our beds and all rooms are given both complimentary bottles of sparkling and still water. The hotel offers every service however they seem miss a lot of basics: Used room service dishes and trays languish in the hallways for 24hrs or more and table service at dinner is miserable and slow (we sat down at 7:30 and didn't receive the main course until 9:00).,Date of stay: October 2010,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Saint Louis, Missouri",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nellie1919

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,sbcarrvp wrote a review Jul 2010,50,Sofitel Marakech offers splendor and superb service...well worth it!,First off the Sofitel experience is just that...and experience right from the reception with cleansing rose water towels and mint tea as you go through the registration process. All to make you feel important and valued as clients.  The complex is undergoing some renovations which were largely transparent to us. We ended up in two of the older rooms which were well away from the lobby and the pool area. While not ideal it was workable just a bit of a jaunt to get to the pool. The rooms were well appointed very clean and quite comfortable. The beds were superb and made for an easy comfortable sleep.  The service provided by the staff was simply outstanding. Everyone from porters to management is polite friendly and helpful....always! Amazing how the staff could always appear immaculate in dress and conduct in 38 degree heat...and still smile constantly....well done! Our rooms included breakfast which was available in a buffet style and was simply amazing! Superb french-press coffee and freshly-squeezed orange juice delivered to your table.  On a note for improvement the service poolside was slow and occasionally orders were forgotten. Whether this was due to language issues or simply the fact that it appeared there were insufficient waiters available to cater to all the demands it could be improved. In our case we ordered some stone fired pizza that was cold by the time it was brought to us. Overall though...a minor issue for what was a terrific stay.  Having stayed at the Sofitel Agadir as well we can highly recommend this chain as a top-notch 4 and 5 star quality in service amenities and accomodations.,Date of stay: July 2010,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Edmonton, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sbcarrvp
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,MJManchester wrote a review Jul 2010,50,The place to stay,Went for the second time in a space of two months and on both occasions enjoyed the hotel and its hospitality very much. Fronm the moment you enter the hotel till when you depart you have welcoming and pleasant staff. Free complimentary internet access at the pool side also helped with keeping in touch with the office whilst enjoying the poolside wih the family (some may say this is sad but regretably had no choice). Hospitality was extended whenever you were sat in the reception by being offered hot traditional tea. (They get me addicted).  Having stayed at other 5 star hotels in Marrakech i would not look beyond Sofitel in the future.,Date of stay: July 2010,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Manchester,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MJManchester
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,joeyjump wrote a review Jun 2010,30,beautiful hotel.... terribley bad service!,hotel was lovely... expensive but what you would expect for a 5 star hotel. we had payed for a pool view room and were not given one.. we complained and were upgraded to a junior suite with pool view room was lovely but too dark and the air con was definatley not cold enough.. we complained and they fixed it but it was still the same we discovered that it was the same in all the rooms. The service was so poor waiting 40 minutes for drinks i wouldnt have minded if they were cocktails but simply cans of coke and fanta and in th sweltering heat its umbearable to wait that long for a drink. The food in the resteraunt and pool bar i felt were poor and not to a high standard and very expensive and also waiting around an hour for your meal to come! overall a good holiday but the poor service definatly lets the hotel down.,Date of stay: June 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joeyjump
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,valkjes wrote a review Jun 2010,40,"nice hospitable place, well situated, quiet.",We spent a week in this hotel. Room ( junior suite) well equipped fresh flowers every day and a beautiful view of the Atlas mountains. The garden is pretty and everything is well maintained and it's nice to come back to this place with 2 swimming pools after an exhausting day in the centre of Marrakechwhich is not too far away. Personnell is taking good care of clients they are very efficient and hospitable. We had a good time here and we would go back there if we would consider returning to Marrakech.  Breakfast is the only thing that we skipped after one try; too expensive for what they offer and the service is rather unkind  plus there are good alternatives quite near the hotel.,Date of stay: May 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,holland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valkjes

The pool area is very good although the pool itself was freezing!You have to pay to use the indoor one.

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,alfalove wrote a review Apr 2010,30,"Big, but without a soul - service not for a 5 star",It's a complex with many wings and basically two hotels in one (the other one is the Sofitel ... & spa). You can basically walk for quite some time before getting to your room.  Rooms are spacious nicely decorated. The staff is totally incapable of managing a good service with very long waiting time and with the staff going around without paying any attention to you.  The garden is nice but could be better and bigger for a 5 star hotel.  I wouldn't rate it as a 5 star hotel. On the other side prices of the extras (e.g. drinks) are at a level of 5 star.,Date of stay: March 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Milan, Italy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alfalove
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,William G wrote a review Mar 2010,40,Pleasant...,A pleasant hotel with attentive service. We were given a small double room upon arrival that was in front of the children's pool (the worst location possible) and had to request a change. I suspect this was because we had booked at a special rate online and naturally it left us with a bad first impression. In any case a move to a large double on an upper floor with a nice view was quickly affected and we enjoyed our stay. The staff as in most good Moroccan hotels is outstanding and the buffet breakfast--in particular--impressive. The site is convenient for visiting both the new and old areas of the city.,Date of stay: February 2009,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Chicago, Illinois",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WilliamGodley
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,SecretTester wrote a review Mar 2010,20,Worst reception service ever,The reception is the first impression you get of a hotel. It seems that the Sofitel doesn't really care about that. Reception staff is rude unfriendly and does not even attempt to help or resolve problems. Maybe they should retrain the pool & garden staff for reception duty as they are very nice and friendly.  Hotel is o.k. (beds were terrible though) but far over-priced. They charge 100 MAD for an hour internet which is ridiculous. We will never stay there again and will take a nice Riad next time instead.,Date of stay: March 2010,Trip type: Traveled with friends,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SecretTester
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Robert O wrote a review Feb 2010,20,"Overpriced, overated","If luxury means bad attitude and condescending service than Sofitel is the place to stay! If you look at the website it appears as if there are two Sofitels in Marrakesch; the Sofitel Palais and Resort and the Sofetel Hotel. They are in fact one and the same hotel with one wing being the ""resort"" and the other wing being the regular hotel with check ing desks at either end of the same lobby. They both share the same pool restaurants and ameninties so don't be tricked into paying the higher price to stay in the ""resort' side.  I had requested a nonsmoking room and the first night we were ushered into a room the smelt like stale cigarette smoke and had so many cigarette burns in the carpet I could not begin to count. Although the terrace was nice it was always a challenge to clean the pigion droppings. The room albeit spacious was very tired and in need of updating. The carpet was rippled the wallpaper peeling.....  When I asked the concierge about hiring a car to go to Essouria I was given a lecture about only hiring the hotel cars and becuase times were slow I could arrange a special deal with him and he started to bargain like in one of the souks. I do not expect this of a concierge nor of a supposed five star hotel. The location is slight away from the Medina and there are few amenities around. We found the best coffee shop to be at the hotel on across the street from the Sofitel and the restuarants at the hotel to be over priced and over rated. Find a nice Riad and you will probably be much happier and pay a far better price.",Date of stay: October 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Toronto, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertMichaelCanada

Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,sbrantley wrote a review Nov 2009,30,Take a lot of money with you - A LOT.,It's a shame about this hotel because it has a lot going for it. The location to the medina is great and it's walkable to several good cafes and restaurants. The rooms are nice. So is the pool. That's about as far as I can go because the Sofitel Palais Imperial just nickel and dimes you for everything. And then of course you have to the tip the concierge or doorman for having just nickel and dimed you. The young women at the reception desk are out and out rude. Then there's the food which is just this side of atrocious. On our next visit we won't be coming back here. There are so many places in Marrakech that we're sure to find something better elsewhere.,Date of stay: November 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Valley Forge, Pennsylvania",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sbrantley
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,JohnLLondon wrote a review Nov 2009,40,"Excellent service, good location, just a bit bland",I was here on a business trip/ trade show.  Good points - excellent service everywhere uniformly friendly and plenty of staff  Decent sized rooms with attractive balcony pretty landscaped gardens with one heated pool which was a bonus in late November. Extensive seating/day beds around pool.  Minus points - breakfasts seem to be the same every day a bit dull after 5 days  pool restaurant is expensive and the menu is a bit limited.  Decor looks a bit tired in places. A very long walk to most guestrooms. no separate shower cubicle. The whole experience is just a bit bland nothing particularly memorable. If you are going to Marrakech you should stay in a more personable riad. for same price.  Only really bad point is the spa where you have to pay ¬£25 to use per day even if you are a hotel resident which is absurd. Granted the hammam is attractive but this is a crazy fee and residents should get a much reduced price or FOC.,Date of stay: November 2009,Trip type: Traveled on business,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnLLondon
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Ivan W wrote a review Nov 2009,50,This indeed is a fine hotel,After reading reviews of Sofitel Marrakesh it was with some trepidation we set off for a 2-week holiday in early November - however we are so glad to have had the pleasure of our stay there to form our own opinion.  This indeed is a fine hotel with beautiful pool facilities and staff with a kind friendly and helpful disposition.  Being somewhat mobility restricted we had requested a ground floor room near facilities and this was awaiting us. 2 other requests regarding the room were attended to while we had dinner. The courtesy and helpfulness of Ikram Bouzeema and colleagues at the front desk were matched by the attention of Rabbi and Nadia serving dinner each evening.  The grounds and 2 sunny pools (especially the heated one!) were a delight facilitated by solicitous pool staff ( a hand-rail to ease entry to the warm pool would be greatly appreciated).  The room was spacious bed sumptiously comfortable plumbing faultless and food excellent - though a change in dinner menu would have been good. A bit more variety in the European breakfast section would be a bonus unless you prefer to break your fast with soup and dates.  Location is ideal with a ¬£3 trip by petit taxi to the square - the culture shock of becoming familiar with the Souk is absolutely fascinating and really good fun. The new town is greatly more sophisticated than on our last visit 15 years ago.  Rugs were haggled for and amazingly were delivered to our home in Scotland the day after we returned.  All in all we are reflecting on a wonderful 2 weeks of a relaxing but stimulating holiday with fabulous weather - even eating outdoors each evening.,Date of stay: November 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Aberdeen,Scotland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IvanW799
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,Al M wrote a review Nov 2009,50,"Excellent, well-located hotel in Marrakech.",I have stayed in this hotel several times but this is my first review. I found it to be a very well-located hotel convenient and well maintained. I think the price is a little high for what you get but this is really the same situation for all hotels in Marrakech and pretty much all of Morocco.  The service on check in was superb. Mint tea while you are waiting to fill out the hotel registration card was appreciated. A damp scented washcloth was provided for your hands and face.  The room was perfectly acceptable. It was clean the bathroom well maintained with plenty of hot water and the air conditioning functioned acceptably.  The breakfast buffet which was included in my room rate was well above average for Marrakech. The price if paid separately was quite high and you should therefore bargain to have it included in your room rate.  I have stayed in many many hotels in Marrakech and the Sofitel is one of my favorites.,Date of stay: November 2009,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Cedar City, Utah",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/morocco_traveller
Hotel Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial,ianoona wrote a review Nov 2009,50,Pleasant surprise,Having read some recent reviews my wife and I did have some misgivings about this hotel. However when we arrived for check in I was pleasantly surprised. The receptionist asked me to take a seat whilst she started our check in. My wife and I and my daughter and son in law (who were not checking in) were offered scented towels and our registration documents soon brought over for me to sign. A member of the reception staff showed us to our junior suite which was an even bigger surprise. The junior suite was larger than many full suite's we have stayed in and really nicely decorated. We had a double balcony accessed from both bedroom and lounge and approximately 25' wide. The lounge and dining area consisted of a comfortable 3 piece suite and a table an 4 chairs . The bathroom had a changing area a bathroom a shower room and a seperate wc.  The quality of the hotel continued into the public areas and out to the two pools outside.  I found staff to be courteous and friendly and the hotel location was ideal for restaurants. Value for money the hotel I thought was excellent with our junior suite costing 142 Euro pn!!,Date of stay: November 2009,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Cheshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ianoona
