Hotel Almas,Alisha wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Exceeded our expectations:),Very nice hotel. Location was good everything’s close by. Kawthar at reception was so kind and helpful and helped to make our special occasion even more special. Service is 10/10. The only thing I would change a little is the breakfast it’s the same everyday however the juices they serve were the best we’ve had :).,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beautybyalisha
Hotel Almas,Wajahat Ullah wrote a review Jan 2023,50,Exceptional Stay,At first I was hesitant to book this hotel but it came as a wonderful surprise. This hotel is located just behind the shopping street of Guilez where there are multiple eateries around. The check in was quick and the room was spacious and clean. The bedding was clean and comfortable. However the bathrooms were small but the shower constantly had hot water in the cold weather. Great value of money will definitely come again.    important tip: please book your rooms without breakfast as the breakfast selection was quite disappointing.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Karachi, Pakistan",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_Sheikhwajahat
Hotel Almas,Eddie C wrote a review Dec 2022,50,Great budget hotel,Stayed here with my brother for a four night stay in Marrakesh. The hotel is great value for money. The rooms are clean and spacious. The complimentary breakfast is good it's continental with cereal yogurts and selection of pastries. The hotel is located in the Gueliz area in the Ville Nouvelle. There is lots of restaurants a few bars serving alcohol and a modern European style shopping centre. It's a 20 minute walk or short taxi ride from the Medina. Facilities wise it's just the roof top pool but for a base for those wishing to explore Marrakesh it's ideal.,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Kettering, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/295eddiec

Hotel Almas,Shirin E wrote a review Sep 2022,30,An Average hotel with potential for improvement,Towels definitely have seen better days they have been used and they used to be white probably at some point in their life. The room we stayed in was ok and clean it needs improvement like getting rid of the old carpet. Unfortunately the room where food is served is very depressing most of the time the curtains are closed we only had breakfast in there although our tour package included dinner as well unfortunately after our first dinner when we arrived at the hotel we realized that this is not a place to eat dinner. Marrakesh has a strong culinary and I do recommend to adventure out of this hotel for food.,Date of stay: September 2022,,"Munich, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShirinE20
Hotel Almas,Jason JG wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Worth the money and best budget hotel,The hotel is surprisingly good for a hotel at such a budget price. The room is clean the balcony is cute the bed is comfortable the roof pool is well maintained and most important the staff are very friendly. I came early at the noon before the regular check-in time but the receptionists accommodated me and found a proper room in minutes.    It’s located at the center of the new city and also not far from the tourists attractions in and surrounding the old city.    People said the facilities look outdated. But I found they are working perfectly fine. You get what you paid.    I really enjoyed my stay here and will come back again.,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Tucson, Arizona",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/188jieg
Hotel Almas,santpedor wrote a review Aug 2022,30,Room for improvement,The man in reception was not friendly and helpful and when I commented that I would post this on tripadvisor he just laughed. Certainly not a good professional !!!!!!  The hotel is well situated and reasonably clean and comfortable. However there is a fishmonger next door and there was a strong fishy smell.  The rooms at the back have a balcony but our bathroom was rather small.,Date of stay: August 2022,,"Barcelona, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/santpedor

Hotel Almas,Frank D wrote a review Jun 2022,50,Good Hotel Great Location,This is a nice hotel with a really good location. The breakfasts are certainly nothing to brag about. A help yourself gathering of fruits and breads and some meats and hard boiled eggs. If you happen to see anyone the 'chef' will do eggs or an omelet for you.    My room was a bit small but adequate and very nicely finished. I especially liked the balcony/terrace where one can smoke - but NOT IN THE ROOM. There is also a nice pool and deck area on the roof.,Date of stay: May 2022,,"Slidell, Louisiana",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/755frankd

Hotel Almas,Kaz2061 wrote a review May 2022,30,Good position,After reading the reviews on here I must admit it raised concerns but we stayed here our first and last night in Morocco and it was fine bearing in mind we travelled during Ramadan so the meal on our first night was OK but nothing special and we had arrived early evening we just put it down to it being a budget hotel and it was OK  When we arrived for our last night we had a different room and the food was really good  The staff were a different team and a lot friendlier too,Date of stay: April 2022,,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kaz2061
Hotel Almas,NYC86 wrote a review Mar 2022,30,Great Location so-so Hotel,The hotel's location is its best feature. There are plenty of bars restaurants and shopping within a 5-10 minute walk of the property. Its also only about a 25 minute walk to the medina (or a 5 minute cab ride if preferred). We chose the hotel because of its location and were not disappointed with that aspect of the stay.    The rooms were spacious and we had a balcony which was great however in February the hotel does not offer AC. Marrakech in Feb can be quite warm and there were days when it was above 80 degrees. The room got quite hot with the only solution being to keep the balcony door open in the evening while sleeping. The balconies are not entirely private and it would be easy for someone to go from one balcony to another easily - all of this goes to say that this option left us feeling a bit uneasy. When asked if they could turn the AC on the hotel said flatly no that was not possible because it was February.    Hotel staff also spoke minimal English. This was fine because I have a working knowledge of French but if someone did not speak any French they would be in a bind getting themselves understood.    The restaurant was fine - nothing special. Breakfasts were disappointing but dinners were adequate.    We were touring the city all day most days and didn't use the pool but were told there was one on the top floor. Overall I'd have a hard time recommending this place and if I went back would certainly not stay here again.,Date of stay: February 2022,,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NYC86
Hotel Almas,Rosie P wrote a review Mar 2020,30,Excellent location & clean but small annoyances,We stayed here for 6 nights in March as a couple.  Location was excellent in newer part of town with lots of restaurants & bars close by plus the shopping mall if that’s your thing. We actually walked a couple of times to & from the medina but also very easy to grab a cab.  The room was very clean towels replaced regularly & staff really friendly & helpful in all areas. Strong WiFi in room the only place it didn’t work was by the pool.  A couple of English channels on the tv too.  Down sides of this hotel- not a huge problem but the rooms are furnished very darkly which makes the whole room appear very dark & could do with an update.  The shower was hot good power but the shower door leaked. A lot.  A nice little pool area on the roof which never really got that busy whilst we were there & free towels & sun beds provided- no bar here but easy to order via the guy that’s on the towel stand. Well it is when he’s there!!! He seemed to disappear quite a lot which left us waterless. So make sure you bring your own! Also make sure you bring cash I’m not sure if you can order to your room number but everyone we saw just paid in cash.  There were no coat hangers at all in our room & I requested a hairdryer 3 times twice via email before we arrived (which they ignored both times) & once at the desk but it never appeared. Again not a huge problem but just annoying!  My partner hated breakfast I thought it was ok & did the job of a quick in & out to fill you up before a day out but he thought it was low quality & not much choice but I didn’t mind it. The restaurant could also do with an update on decor.  We booked a day trip via the front desk- day was excellent but just check what is definitely included for the price. There was a lot of confusion as to whether the tour provided at the location was included or not it was only 3 euros per person but a lot of people in the group got very angry that this wasn’t explained properly.  Overall it was a good stay clean & great location which is all you really need!,Date of stay: March 2020,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rosanna_Pittock_
Hotel Almas,Lars Skaug wrote a review Mar 2020,40,Nice hotel,Stayed at Almas for 3 nights. Nice located .  The rooms where clean and friendly staff.  On the roof it was a little pool and some sunbed’s where you can relax from the city noise.  The only thing that make my grade 4 and not 5 is the breakfast. Not so much to choose from but still good enough.  I recomend this hotel.,Date of stay: March 2020,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Trondheim, Norway",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/larskaug
Hotel Almas,CharlotteRodgers wrote a review Mar 2020,50,"Clean, quiet and great location",Our 4 night stay was great. The location was good. On a quiet street with no noise at night from outside. There were lots of restaurants within a 10 minute walk and only a 30-35 minute walk to the Médina/souks. All very safe to walk around and paths well lit.  The hotel room was clean warm and comfortable. Bed slightly on the hard side but still fine.  The breakfast was good enough for a quick snack before going out for the day.  Taxi organised to the airport for 150 dihram which we thought was reasonable enough.  Addition of the pool was nice. Quite busy in the afternoon though with few options to sit down.  There is some noise through the corridors of people going to their rooms but this doesn’t last long and wasn’t disturbing for us.  Would certainly be happy to stay again.,Date of stay: March 2020,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Reading, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlotteRodgers12
Hotel Almas,Sarah S wrote a review Mar 2020,10,STAY AWAY,The staff here will make your trip one of your worst! The staff (particularly one of the reception members) have been openly sexist and offensive. When my sister tried to deal with this and speak to the manager all of the staff were purposely evasive!

He is sexist rude and should be fired. He refused to share his name when it was requested. If you are considering staying here I strongly recommend you do not. Please speak to you staff and fire those who behave this way.

Hotel Almas,Alana_sb wrote a review Mar 2020,10,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,Worst hotel I’ve stayed in. The staff are RUDE. We arrived at 1am on Monday 1st March to find a man behind reception talking on his mobile. I had 2 small children who were shattered from a 4 hour delayed flight. After 10 mins I asked if there was anyone to help. He yelled at me to say I am here are you blind? I said you are on your mobile and ignoring us to which he shrugs. I said look I have 2 small kids who are not well. Another couple walked in and he started to serve them. I said excuse me we were here first. He carries on. The young couple said please serve them as they have kids which was decent of them. I said why are you so rude? Do you understand the meaning of customer service? He shrugs again. I said I will report this to booking.com. He said am I bothered? After so long we finally get a room. This was the worst part of the holiday. When my husband returned downstairs for the WiFi password the man says to my husband you are Muslim why don’t you beat your wife. Then she won’t be so rude and obnoxious. He continued to insult me by saying she wears a hijab (scarf) so as a Muslim woman she should be seen and not heard. I have never heard anything so disgusting in my life from another let alone a staff member dealing with the public!!!  Room was never cleaned well or sheets changed in 5 days. The bathrooms were disgusting hair in the shower which meant the drain kept clogging and overflowing. The breakfasts were appalling. Never enjoyed the food as it was limited and cold. The location is quite rough. Never felt safe outside.,Date of stay: March 2020,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Sittingbourne, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alana_sb
Hotel Almas,andre_ctx wrote a review Feb 2020,20,You can get other better 3 stars hotel,I know I booked a 3 star hotel and did not expect any kind of luxury. But this hotel is much worse than any other 3 star hotel I have been to. First of all I was in Marrakech in February and although it was winter during the day it was hot and I wanted to turn the air conditioning on. However the hotel reception informed me that the air conditioning in the rooms do not work in cold mode until April (???). It only works for hot air. This is absurd as it does not allow the guest to choose the temperature/mode that I like. The bathroom was not good it’s old and the drain was always clogged. The shampoo provided by the hotel was bad. The hotel was very noisy I could hear all the conversations of the other guests in their room. This even disturbed my sleep. Breakfast had few varieties. The card to enter the room always had problems and I had to return to the reception to get a new one. I do not recommend this hotel and would not stay again.,Date of stay: February 2020,,"Sao Paulo, SP",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andre_ctx
Hotel Almas,amazing world wrote a review Feb 2020,40,Good hotel which is well located away from the crowds and easy to get to Medina by bus.,Hotel Almas is conveniently located as there're restaurants nearby including seafood restaurants. It has a good decor and friendly staff. Breakfast is continental which is adequate. You can take a bus to town. It's only about 5 minutes walk from the hotel across to Rue Mauritanie and it's bus #1 at Avenue Mohammed V. Ask local people for the bus stop to Medina as it's not easy to spot one.,Date of stay: January 2020,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fshpal
Hotel Almas,Jani J wrote a review Dec 2019,30,Great location and nice rooms,The room was really nice spacious and to warm. I was shocked of such a huge bed just for myself. Bathroom was clean. I really liked long walking shower I had never experienced something like this. Staf was kind. No noise from the street and shops. And you have really everything in walking distance. Breakfast was average. The cons: because of so many good comments i was really expected a lot more! All the evening till 00.00 was so many disturbing noises. I mean what are people doing in hotel if they can’t properly behave etc! Stay at home!! Even my earplugs didn’t shut it. Bed leanings were toooo hot! Air in room was to dry the curtains were not dark so the outside light you can see inside ... imperial holiday hotel where i was for 3 nights was a big dump but the quality of sleeping was there much better!

Hotel Almas,Trinderh wrote a review Nov 2019,30,Average,We stayed here recently the hotel room was nice and big and the hotel was always nice and clean.  However my partner is vegetarian so at breakfast there was very little choice so we asked for scrambled eggs which they charged us for but upon speaking to reception said we shouldn't of been charged. The next morning was fine but the following morning the restaurant were awful and basically told my partner he had to go down to reception to sort it out. This is awful customer service because the restaurant staff should of called reception. Once that was done every morning after it was fine but I don't feel like it should of been that difficult to get scrambled eggs for breakfast.    The reception and security staff are lovely and very helpful and friendly.  The hotel is a good location but you would need to get a taxi to the Medina unless you fancied 20-25 minute walk.    The roof top pool is absolutely freezing which is a real shame so we had to go to another hotel to use a warmer pool.,Date of stay: November 2019,,"Bath, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trinderh

Hotel Almas,sunl0ver7 wrote a review Nov 2019,40,Hotel Almas - Well worth a visit,We have just returned from this hotel & would certainly go back yes it’s not ultra modern & yes it’s decor can be a bit dark this is part of its character. The BIG PLUS this hotel is clean they work tirelessly keeping it that way. Breakfast is plentiful pastries boiled eggs fruit fresh juices etc fab coffees & tea. If you wish a cooked breakfast this can be purchased for a small charge.  The Pool is located on the roof & again is cleaned every morning being an early bird I can vouch for this. There are plenty of sun beds & umbrellas you can order Lunch from the pool boy & have it delivered to your sun bed both food & prices good.  Location is fab you are just 2 mins from all the main shops & £3 in a taxi to the medina & souks .  Beds are massive both bed & pillows are comfy.  Looking forward to returning thank you to all staff for making our stay fab. Yes some might not smile but that doesn’t mean they are not nice or helpful.

Hotel Almas,shuzzyx wrote a review Sep 2019,40,"Good hotel, centrally located, nice pool, helpful staff",We had a one week stay here and certainly enjoyed the experience. The pool is certainly one of the better ones and it was so refreshing on a hot day to have a dip on the roof. The room was big and had enough space for all four of us. The only thing we were missing for two nights is a fourth bed. There was some miscommunication here as apparently we only booked for two people still awaiting the outcome of this. The receptionist Khadija was very helpful and quite acommodating. Some say she doesn't smile but I found her to be quite pleasant. Sarah was certainly very smiley and was happy to chat. The location is great for quick access to all sorts of shops food outlets and entertainment quick and easy to walk to. We were hampered by the very hot weather so couldn't walk too far. Breakfast wasn't great to be fair we did have quite a limited choice and things weren't always replenished when finished. Our room did suffer slightly from loud noise late into the night from outside People just dont sleep round there. However this wouldn't be an issue if your room is not facing the side street. Recommended and would stay here again.,Date of stay: August 2019,,"Dewsbury, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shuzzyx
Hotel Almas,Shoaib Tariq wrote a review Aug 2019,10,Disappointing!,I can’t believe how disappointing this was!    Arrived to check in and asked for a balcony room (as booked! I read previously to make sure to remind reception about this as they will give a standard room instead) the receptionist said we have not booked a balcony room. We provided our booking confirmation which proved we did and the receptionist reluctantly gave us the balcony room! We had booked and paid for a room with a balcony so why shouldn’t we get what we paid for?! She said “our systems say you don’t have a balcony but I will give you one anyways” - wow! Your not doing me any favours your giving me what I paid for!    She then asked have you booked any excursions.. we said yes and she instantly told us it was a bad price and she could do better. We paid £100 on getyourguide.com for three day trips for 2 people.. not bad! She offered £140 for the same 3?! We generously declined. From this moment on the receptionist was off with us for our 7 night stay.. we were only 10 minutes in yet! Her name was “Khadija” avoid her if possible.    Throughout the week the Air Conditioning was very intermittent it would work whenever it wanted to. It was 40 degrees outside and felt like 50 degrees inside without air conditioning. Engineers were called about 5 times and we had 3 nights out of 7 that the AC worked. The other 4 it was terrible.    The WiFi is extremely slow.    Room service was strange! We ordered a pizza and on the phone we were told it was made in house but it arrived in a takeout box. When I looked up the name of the takeout box it was literally the takeaway next door! What a joke.    The breakfast is basic but good. The rooftop pool is slightly small but you get what you pay for! Any more than 5 people in the pool and you have to wait your turn to enjoy properly.    There is a security guard called “Bedro” who is genuine and nice he often helped us and would answer any questions. Good man.    Another receptionist called “Sarah” is also very nice she often helped us translate to French and even helped us order food one night! Amazing lady.. she deserves better.    Overall a bad experience. Never again.    AVOID THIS HOTEL UNLESS YOU DON’T HAVE ANY OTHER CHOICE.

Hotel Almas,Nataliajames1990 wrote a review Aug 2019,50,Perfect,Just got back from a weeks stay in Marrakech. I have nothing bad to say about Hotel Almas we booked this as a package holiday through on the beach and we were not disappointed. The hotel is roughly a thirty minute walk from the main square Jemma El Fnaa and easy to find. You basically turn out on to the main road find McDonald’s and walk straight up follow Koutoubia you can see it in the distance and you will find yourself at the main square. If not it is only 30DH approx £3 for a taxi for two people. The rooftop pool was a lovely touch it’s not huge but perfect for dipping In and out of to cool down after sunbathing. The roof is a great hot spot! All reception staff were friendly polite and helpful! The rooms were very clean and cleaned everyday. The air con is superb! Rooms are spacious. Nice bathroom very comfy beds. Safe in room free to use. Breakfast was good continental style. Lovely Pastries and fresh juice.    Our friends were able to move to a room with a balcony on request and also allowed to keep their room til 2 with no extra charge which was very nice of them. Not many hotels I have stayed at have been as accommodating!    I would definitely recommend this hotel and stay again.

Even when asked her to print an email she had a really mad moody face / the male receptionist was really friendly . If management is reading this then you should address this ASAP as I don’t think I’ll be staying here ever again ( been a customer for the last 6 years ) . I also overheard a conversation with this receptionist and customer and her customer service was very bad,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,Leicester,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sm_leicester
Hotel Almas,Alex Yeo wrote a review Jun 2019,40,Good hotel for exploring Marrakech!,When I was sorting out my holiday to Marrakech I was at first tempted by the famous Riads in the Medina. Now that I am back I am very glad I stayed here instead! While not the best Hotel I stayed in it was certainly very good and I was chuffed with the value for money.    Location-wise the Hotel is average. It has good public transport connection but is a 20 minute walk away from the Jardin Majorelle and a 30 minute walk from Djemaa el Fnaa the heart of the Medina. That being said I felt much safer taking my luggage the few steps from the taxi to the door than winding through the streets of the Medina. Furthermore in close proximity are plenty of supermarkets and restaurants. Be aware that generally you can't take food inside from the restaurants though.    Rooms here are very spacious! It honestly feels more like an apartment than a Hotel. Bathroom was big and well looked after with a large shower but no actual bath (if that's more your thing). The Bed is comfy and large with Arabesque nooks next to it one with a plug socket. You get a desk a wardrobe with a safe and - my favourite spot - two armchairs and a table. I was lucky enough to get a room with a view of the street below - watching life progress along Avenue Moulay Rachid was a pleasant background for reading.    There is also a rooftop pool - quite a good sized one as well! The view is second to none. I saw as far as Kasbah Mosque and the Atlas Mountains are easily visible. There is also a nice table for those who just want to soak in the view rather than soak themselves.    The food is very good - if you're staying here make sure to get the breakfast! It is an incredible mix of Moroccan and French cuisine with croissants and flatbreads as well as different sweet treats everyday! Plus the shops particularly Carrefour make it easy to find snacks if you have a craving. That being said they do not compare to the hotel food. My compliments to the chef!    The staff here are good. Receptionists are very welcoming and helpful and security is great. Within 10 minutes of arrival I was in my room having checked in and booked my shuttle to the airport. Excellent service. All the staff I spoke to spoke French and English and welcomed my poor attempts at Arabic/Darija!    All in all while it is a bit of a way out from the main sights and experiences in Marrakech this hotel is a star. I felt safe welcomed and looked after. I woke up looking forward to breakfast and eagerly awaited seeing the view from the pool. It was a pleasure to stay here and should I return to Marrakech I will certainly be coming back!,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alex_Yeo1

Hotel Almas,Said A wrote a review Jan 2019,30,"An ""old"" hotel in the modern Gueliz area",My wife and I stayed at Hotel Almas for 6D/5N. We requested a room of a higher floor and we were pleased we were allocated a room on the top 4th floor facing the main road. From our room on the higher floor there was negligible traffic noise. Reception staff was very warm and friendly.    Our room was spacious and clean but the decor was not exciting a bit plain. The colour scheme was not contemporary not bright. Well it was an old hotel we could not have a high expectation. What struck me as a big disappointment was that there was no kettle and no tea/coffee making facilities. It was so inconvenient not to have our morning coffee the first thing when we got up. We in fact bought an electric kettle to serve our need in the room. Our double bed was big; it was two single beds pushed together. Hotel Almas offered an ordinary hotel experience nothing special.    The breakfast had a rather good spread freshly prepared and replenished regularly. A variety of cooked food and pastries cereals fruits coffee/tea and juices were served. The croissants were delicious and lovely.    If you are an English speaking person like my wife and I you would have to struggle to watch the TV. The programmes were in French or dubbed in French!    The hotel was situated in the very nice newer part of Marrakech in the Gueliz area. The hotel location was just great. There were lots of good restaurants nearby. In fact the Winoo Restaurant was just next door to the hotel. We also found Snack el Bahria a short walk from the hotel; this small restaurant served very tasty food. Along the nearby Ave Muhammed V was Carre Eden a good modern shopping complex with Carrefour supermarket and a food court.    A short taxi ride brought us to within the Medina surrounded by clay walls in which was the old part of Marrakech city. We visited the historical Koutoubia Mosque with its elegant 70 metres high minaret. We walked in the beautiful garden surrounding the mosque. A short walk to the north led us to the fabulous square of Jemaa el-Fna the heart and soul of the old city. From Jemaa el-Fna we accessed the warren of the souks where my wife and I had the most memorable experience treating our senses. Our eyes in fact had a fantastic feast looking at the display of merchandise.    The Majorelle Gardens was within walking distance or a short taxi ride from Hotel Almas. This stunning garden showcased cactus plant species from all over the world spectacular bougainvillea and water lilies. A visit to this crown jewel of Marrakech gardens should not be missed.,Date of stay: November 2018,,"Petaling Jaya, Malaysia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/39saida

Rooms were clean not the most modern but for all the time we spent in the rooms we were more than happy.  Housekeepers - so polite and friendly but seemed to be there all day with one lady doing an entire floor by herself and with a smile on her face!  Pool area is small but totally fine. Difficult to order soft drinks while at pool - I did once but didn’t again too much drama for two soft drinks!  Breakfast had different variety of cooked foods daily as well as pastries cereal fruits breads coffee and juices. More than satisfied with that.  Female receptionists were rude abrupt and uninterested.  A male member of reception staff was brilliant and couldn’t do enough for us going as far as to print our boarding passes for us and flagging taxis for us outside.  One night there was a man in our corridor shouting on his phone late at night for a while and I contacted reception to speak to him but nobody came at all and the man continued to scream in the corridor for ages...not great.

Hotel Almas,Donna Louise S wrote a review Sep 2018,50,Excellent hotel and friendly staff,I stayed at this hotel for 2 weeks with my two sons. The hotel is situation in the Gueliz area and is just around the corner from the main shopping centre.    The room was very comfy and cleaned every day by the maid. We had fresh towels each day and bed made and changed on request It was also hoovered each day so all in all we where very looked after all our stay.    We had breakfast which was a good selection for a continual breakfast however if you enjoy a cooked breakfast each day that was very limited with just two dishes each morning.    The rooftop pool is small and it gets very hot up there. If you need umbrella's or sunbed mats you can ask for these at the area where you can get the towels which are also supplied.    I found the staff friendly and helpful but there is a language barrier there as some can not speak very much English    All in all my time at this hotel was enjoyable and if I did come back to Marrakesh I wouldn't hesitate to stay at this hotel again,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donnalouises2018

The location is good as it is in the 'new city' Gueliz and shopping centre nearby with loads of well known brands and fast food restaurants. Breakfast was not exciting at all only a few options available which didn't really set us up right for the rest of the day like many other hotels. Pool was smaller than expected and sun beds would get occupied pretty quickly. Reception team (only ever saw one woman and one man) were a bit stand offish even when the questions were quite simply - it was as if we were disturbing them.

The hotel itself was nice with more modern furnishing. The rooms were nice for what you pay and the wifi quality was good. Overall we found the reception staff nice.  However the only complaint we have is that on our arrival our flight was very late. We arrived at the hotel at 1am with our bank cards and not enough cash to pay for our stay (there was no option to prepay). The hotel receptionist told us that the card machine is not working tonight and he made us walk to the cashpoint at 1am to withdraw cash. He could have easily took the money off us the next morning.

I had a very good sized room on the 1st floor. Plenty of wardrobe space and a decent bathroom with a good shower. The room had a terrace which even though the view wasn’t great was an added bonus at the end of a long day of Médina meandering.    Breakfast was good although it lacked the variety of some of the larger hotels. The roof top pool was fab - clean and long enough for a decent swim.    All the staff were friendly without being effusively pushy (a downside in some Moroccan hotels).    My only real criticism was that the hotel was noisy in the evenings (paper thin walls) but that’s easily solved with ear plugs.    The location is ok - certainly not the prettiest spot but it’s only a 15 minute walk to the Médina and also to the Majorelles Gardens and the fabulous Grand Cafe De La Poste is just two minutes away. There’s also a very good Carrefour supermarket round the corner which is great if you want to buy alcohol or a picnic.

The hotel has some very flattering promotional literature including some inventive photography.  This hotel was recommended by British Airways as part of a British Airways holiday thankfully our stay was only of four nights duration.  The basis of our stay was bed and breakfast.  Located off one of the main street in the newer part of Marrakech decent restaurants were within an easy 10 minute walk. The hotel is in need of redecoration the room we were given was spacious but lacked sufficient storage or hanging space one needs to bring their own hangers as there were only three in the wardrobe and the hotel had no more.  There is no tea making facilities in the room or vending machines in the common parts. Our double bed was in fact two single beds pushed together badly. The carpet was stained and soiled.  The breakfast offered may be at best described as grim this is surprising given the range of restaurants serving great food all within a 10 minute walk of the hotel. The swimming pool was some what smaller than suggested by the hotel brochure the exposed electrical wiring and loose light fittings below the water line proved off putting.

The hotel is within walking distance of the old town and it's an easy walk straight down the main road.  The hotel itself was clean and the staff were friendly and helpful although be sure to get a receipt or record that you have paid the city taxes as due to a mix up we were asked to pay twice and couldn't prove that we already had (luckily a staff member remembered!). Our room was at the front of the hotel and was slightly noisy but not unbearable. Rooms are spacious and clean and the beds a very good size. Breakfast was included and had a selection of items to eat.

Hotel Almas,SuttonTravelNut wrote a review Feb 2018,40,Nothing to complain about...,"I booked this hotel as part of a ""flight plus hotel"" deal that was being offered by British Airways. It was my first time in Marrakech and as I was also travelling alone I didn't really feel I was ready for the full ""Riad in the Medina"" experience and wanted to break myself in gently - this hotel fit the bill very nicely. The street it's on is a little on the scruffy side but head just one street over and you're in the shopping area of the new part of town with plenty of shops and restaurants and a small mall. The main sights are all pretty much in walking distance of the hotel although that may of course depend on what your idea of ""walking distance"" is! One day I walked all the way to the Bahia Palace and whilst not a quick 10 minute walk away I felt it was quite do-able and I'm not particularly fit!    For some reason the hotel has a policy posted just inside the door saying that you're not allowed to bring in your own food and drink and that the restaurant will cater to your needs. I can understand why they say that but at the same time you don't always need or want a sit down meal or to pay the hotel's prices for a bottle of water...I didn't actually witness anyone having their bags searched though. ;)    I took the advice of other posts on Tripadvisor and took my spending money in the form of hard cash (GBP) - on arrival I asked at reception where the best place was to change money - the answer I received was ""Here"" and I have to say they were right! I got the exact same rate as advertised online and they only charged a tiny amount of commission. So I found myself only changing up as much money at reception each day as I felt I would need (if I did happen to need any extra during the day I would just use an ATM to get some out).    The rooftop pool area is a nice place to chill out for a while. I didn't actually swim in the pool (which in January was still on the cold side) but on my last day I had a few hours to kill while waiting for my airport pick up so decided to sit up on the roof terrace and enjoy the views and warm sunshine (which by British standards would have been considered a perfect summer's day!) - on a clear day you can see all over Marrakech and as far as the Atlas Mountains.    Breakfast was fine with a reasonable selection of cereal bread cheese eggs and meat plus a couple of trays of hot dishes one of which varied daily. The coffee and orange juice were good too. They also have other dishes you can order for an additional charge.    My room was perfectly comfortable and I slept well each night. I had one of the rooms with a balcony at the rear of the hotel although I did find on my first day that the balcony door wouldn't lock and as I was on the first floor and level with a flat roof just outside I felt it needed attention. I reported it to reception and by the time I returned to my room a few hours later the lock had been fixed.    Should you be the kind of person who likes to spend your downtime watching TV in your room if you're an English speaker you will struggle to find anything to watch. I only found one channel in English something American with Arabic subtitles so luckily the wi-fi was good and I had taken my tablet and a Bluetooth speaker so BBC Radio 2 kept me company when I was in my room! You should be OK if you speak French Spanish Italian German or Arabic though.    Other than that for the price you can't really go wrong with this hotel.",Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Reigate, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuttonTravelNut

Hotel Almas,Loulou1605 wrote a review Jan 2018,40,Good and practical hotel in the Modern Marrakesh,Great location (close to Jardin Majorelle the Medina and not far from the airport) nice restaurants around you avoid the hassle from the medina and can take a taxi or a bus from there. There is a bus stop just behind the hotel taking you to Jemaa El Fna for 4 MAD much less than what you would have paid for a taxi ride.  All in all we were very satisfied considering other experiences of riads in the medina which were in dark streets without car access to carry the luggage easier.  The breakfast is nice but a bit minimal. UK and US people used to salty food for breakfast might find it a bit too sweet. I would definitely book this hotel again if returning to Marrakesh.,Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Oslo, Norway",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Loulou1605
Hotel Almas,beemarcus wrote a review Dec 2017,50,Great for the night we needed it,We needed one night and two rooms in Marrakech before catching an early morning flight and Almas did the job well. Price was right rooms were clean staff very accomodating. One room was facing front the other back; the latter are better; much quieter and most/all on that side seem to have a small balcony. Lots of cheap and interesting cafes in the area. When we arrived at the airport we discovered we'd left something very important in the room. We called the hotel they found it and sent it back to the airport with the same taxi driver we had on the way out. They were all very helpful.,Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Saint Mary in the Marsh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beemarcus
Hotel Almas,Arvind S wrote a review Dec 2017,40,A good hotel in a central locality,Morocco is known for its hospitality to the tourists. We arrived at the hotel and were given a warm welcome.    The location of the hotel is very central. Next only to the famous Guilez square it is well connected to all parts of Marrakech. So movement is never a problem.    The rooms were cozy and comfortable. Clean. The staff were always ready to help.    Food in the restaurant was ok as there were not many options. However if you are a vegetarian you will struggle for sure.    I was on the second floor but it had the noise from the street. I do not know why but each morning I would hear some strange noise as if two people are quarrelling. That was a bit of disturbance.    Overall it is a very good hotel worth recommending.,Date of stay: December 2017,,"Hamburg, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/390arvinds
Hotel Almas,thomasB2801FT wrote a review Dec 2017,50,Great staff in a well designed hotel,I really enjoyed the excellent service of the friendly staff at this hotel. The hotel has the right size to offer facilities I enjoy without being so large you have to walk miles inside the place. This includes a nice rooftop deck with a pool and a reception/conference room. An oasis in a hectic city. I had a room facing the rear (these are quiet and have a balcony) - very nice. Front facing rooms have no balcony and may experience some traffic noise. For a person in good healt the walk to the Medina is about 20 minutes. The only minor negative is that the carpet in my room was a bit tatty and should be replaced - but not significant enough to loose the best score in my view.,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Oslo, Norway",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomasB2801FT

On first impressions the lady on front desk was quite rude when we checked inwhich we were a little dissapointed about but can say that every other member of staff we met throughout our stay were very helpful and friendly. Lovely rooftop pool which was a pleasant surpriseafter looking at numerous hotels prior to booking I thought this hotel had a pool set in gardens so the rooftop was a very pleasant surprise indeed. The young lad who works at the pool was very helpfulwhenever we went to buy drinks he insisted on bringing them to us but didn't expect any payment as often you find in marrakech. Rooms were lovely and spacious and must say this hotel was very very clean beds were very comfortable and the added bonus of a balcony was lovely toosomewhere nice to sit in the early morning sunshine. The bathroom very spacious too and the shower was awesomenice large cubicle and the water pressure was perfect asfter long days strolling round the city seeing the sites. One of the big added bonuses was the air conditioning it was 50 degrees on our visit so this was a tiny blessing in the warm evenings. Breakfast was of a good standard continental stylewith the offering of boiled eggssausagespotatoes and peppers caring across the daysthere was also a menu form which you could omelettes etc for a small cost. Overall a very pleasant stay and would definatly stay here again if I returned hereideal location to local sights we never paid no more then 20dhiram (approx £1.60) for a taxi from here to the main square.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Willenhall, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/922kayleighe

Hotel Almas,ramkumar721 wrote a review Jul 2017,40,Hotel Almas,On arrival was greeted by friendly door staff who took care of the luggage without hesitation. We had arrived two hours before check in for the rooms which was not a problem at all as we were asked if we wanted to go straight up. One was perfect for the two lads but the other was way to small for the wife myself and the daughter. We went back down to reception and asked if we could be moved receptionist checked and asked us to go to floor 5 room 502.  Have to say this is one of the best rooms in the hotel lots of space and a great view of the city. We'd gone B&B and the breakfast was basic continental was always replenished and fresh.  The roof terrace was for us one of the best things of the hotel very friendly staff (especially Ziad) who couldn't do enough for you and kept the area very tidy.  The location being in the centre was great for us exploring as we did not need taxis and could walk easily to places. A mention for the maids as well who kept the rooms very clean we did on occasions leave personnel belongings in the rooms which were never touched. Oh and you get WIFI in the rooms/ roof terrace not great all the times but worked well. You'd not usually get this in a 3 star hotel so big thumbs up.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Tamworth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ramkumar721
Hotel Almas,Becky Y wrote a review Nov 2017,40,Nice hotel in excellent location,We stayed for 5 nights in a triple room. The hotel is clean and the rooms large and very comfortable. Breakfast was a good buffet.with a selection of continental and local choices. Special mention must go to the chef we stayed on half board and often were the only ones in the restaurant in the evening he made up for this with his service offering to prepare special dishes for us the food he prepared was excellent.  The rooftop pool is clean and offfers great views of the city.  The location of the hotel is in Guiliz 3 mins from a shopping centre and restaurants and only a 5 min 20dr cab ride to the medina. It is only a 20min walk to the Jardin Majorelle which is well worth visiting. As three females we felt very safe in the hotel and surrounding area and thoroughly enjoyed our visit.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Folkestone, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeckyY781
Hotel Almas,DJMuthafunker wrote a review Nov 2017,50,Great little Gem in Gueliz,WE spent our last night here. We had Suite 402 which was beautiful inside. The beds and linen were fantastic.. Nice soft pillows which seems hard to come by in Morocco. We thought the breakfast was fine not sure about the ham though. The staff were so helpful and even got us some bananas which weren't on the set up but went so well with their pancakes and honey. The roof top pool was a lovely addition my only complaint was there seemed to be a strange sulphur smell up there which was off-putting . Also can you sort the speakers out up there as they crackled when the music was playing. But I loved the music and Im just being pocky about the sound quality as I am a Music Producer. Overall it was a greta stay with fantastic staff. Highly recommend this hotel.,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Brighton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DJMuthafunker

How can I miss out the kitchen staff and workers in the breakfast lobby their is a charge to take breakfast in your rooms but we were not charged for my daughter who was a wheelchair user this was so kind of them. The breakfast variety could be improved and their should be a lift to the roof top swimming pool as we couldn't take our daughter swimming due to the stairs and steps leading to the swimming pool.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shermeelak

Main square is a short taxi trip away.  - Clean & hospitable- Staff are very friendly and welcoming. Rooms are cleaned daily and cleaners do a brilliant job.  - Adequate breakfast- Large variety for breakfast considering price.

Adequate for online messaging but inadequate for streaming videos and video calling etc.  - Lack of amenities e.g. irons hairdryers kettle etc. Remember to bring your own!  - Pool area is quite small and not accommodating during busy periods.

There wasn't much of a range to choose from in regards to the breakfast but it was OK. You are in busiest part of Marrakech so other cafes/restaurants are a few minutes walk from the hotel.    Rooms are of decent size convenient and cleaned by the staff on a regular basis. TVs in every room but good luck finding a channel that is in English.    The pool area is actually quite relaxing and good considering it is in the busiest area of Marrakech they have done well with making use of the rooftop pool however the pool is veryyyyy small so don't be expecting to spend a few hours in there. The pool temperature was very cold also considering it was 30+ degrees when we visited Marrakech. If you have clear skies then the view from the rooftop can be quite spectacular.

I reported this to reception on 5/6 occasions where someone was always sent to check the problem fairly quickly. However the problem was never solved and we were not given an alternative. 405 had the same problem. Rooms are not soundproof at all you can clearly hear all noise between rooms. The pool isn't really a pool it's tiny and shallow all the way. Breakfast was not great some cold meats breads pastries boiled eggs 2 cereals and porridge. Liked the fresh fruit juice but I think that was the highlight.    Positives: Some of the reception staff especially one of the taller male staff members is very welcoming and friendly. We requested earlier check in and rooms were ready upon arrival. Activities via the hotel are significantly cheaper than booking online through other companies (you can also haggle and get an even better price). Rooms were comfortable clean and AC was great. We requested upper floor rooms so didn't experience much outdoor noise. Location is good as it's in the heart of the new town.

Hotel Almas,Asif A wrote a review Apr 2016,30,"Clean, good location",Stayed for 7 nights.  Cleanliness - Hotel overall is clean and workers keep on top of hallways/rooms on a daily basis.  Location - Excellent By car 5 mins from Plaza 15-20 mins away from airport and Menara Mall 10 mins away from main Souks 5 mins away from train station. Walking to Jamee el fina and Kourtobia masjid takes 15-20 mins (i walk fast).  Room - Fine for a couple with tv and good wifi everywhere in hotel even by pool. Good English movie channel available with subtitles in Arabic. Bathroom has quite large shower cubicle but quite a rubbish shower.  First night got v.little sleep as we arrived on Saturday and there was a LOT of street noise coming into the room due to location of a number of restaurants which have seating outside. Asked to be moved the following day but times they wanted us to move we were out on excursions so ended up staying whole 7 nights in same room. Luckily noise did die down afterwards but would highly recommend asking for a non-street facing room if a light sleeper. No tea/coffee making facilities in room fridge empty and not stocked.  Breakfast - Buffet mainly breads with cheese cold meat fresh juice tea/coffee selection of sweet pastries boiled eggs..adequate but not really something to write home about. If you order omelettes etc these are charged separately (even if you have breakfast included as part of your stay).    Rooftop pool and terrace is very nice/private.    Nearby there are quite a few restaurants including fish/italian/fast food places which are very cheap to eat out at would highly recommend Winoo which is v.close.  Overall staff are v.friendly and polite. Did have a bad experience on final day checked out late and was told to pay for a room initially then was told even if we pay we could not have a room as the hotel was full. Lady dealing with us was in my opinion just being nasty. We did pay and were able to use the hotel facilities till evening.  Would i stay here again yes...but probably in a non-street facing room.,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Bradford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/921asifa

However the problem was never solved and we were not given an alternative. 405 had the same problem. Rooms are not soundproof at all you can clearly hear all noise between rooms. The pool isn't really a pool it's tiny and shallow all the way. Breakfast was not great some cold meats breads pastries boiled eggs 2 cereals and porridge. Liked the fresh fruit juice but I think that was the highlight.    Positives: Some of the reception staff especially one of the taller male staff members is very welcoming and friendly. We requested earlier check in and rooms were ready upon arrival. Activities via the hotel are significantly cheaper than booking online through other companies (you can also haggle and get an even better price). Rooms were comfortable clean and AC was great. We requested upper floor rooms so didn't experience much outdoor noise. Location is good as it's in the heart of the new town.    Overall I probably wouldn't stay again because of the shower which is the main sticking point.,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/117siraju
Hotel Almas,marion a wrote a review Dec 2015,10,better elsewhere,We booked a room with a cot for a baby which was not available once we arrived. The reaction was 'what do you expect us to do?' The solution a mattress on the floor. There was no ventilation (it was unbearably hot). There was no solution offered for this either. - they were rude and unhelpful - we left.,Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariona397
Hotel Almas,Russell H wrote a review Dec 2015,40,Excellent hotel in great location,Although I booked a single the room I got (#308) was spacious enough to accommodate a family of 3; the bed was massive (maybe 10ft wide!). Everything was very clean and the staff were polite and efficient. It is well located in the Gueliz district which is 25 minutes walk (almost in a straight line) from the medina & Jamaa el Fna or you can take the No.1 bus from the main high street (2 minutes walk from the hotel) which costs 4 DH (about 25p). Marjorelle (YSL) Gardens are 20 minutes walk away. A taxi from/to the airport should cost you no more than 100 DH. The roof-top pool is nice and has plenty of sun-loungers around it for sunbathing. I went at Christmas and had the whole place to myself; the pool was too cold to swim in but it was warm enough (25c) to sunbathe. The breakfast is a bit monotonous but is perfectly adequate for a continental breakfast. I booked 2 excursions (Atlas Mountains (Ourika) and Essouria) through the hotel which were excellent and found that it was cheaper than using the high street travel agencies. It's true what other reviewers say that one of the girls on reception could do with smiling a bit more but I found her perfectly helpful and the other staff were quite friendly. The housekeeping was extremely good and worthy of special mention - perfect service every day and they dealt immediately and enthusiastically with a special request I had (softer pillow; the ones supplied are quite hard). The free in-room WiFi worked fine for me with only a couple of patches of drop-out. The only negative I can think of is that it can be quite noisy as the walls are very thin but it was rarely a problem after 11pm as it is not a 'party destination'. I would recommend a room on the 3rd or 4th floor facing the back (not the main street) in order to minimise the noise from the area. I will definitely book here again next time I'm in Marrakech.,Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled solo,"England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rkhigham

Hotel Almas,Chris-RDD wrote a review Dec 2015,40,Pleasant hotel in a good location,The Almas Hotel was a good base for a short trip to Marrakech. The hotel is located in one of the main hubs of Marrakech with several restaurants in the adjoining buildings. The old part of the city (the Medina) is about 20 minutes walk away. The buffet breakfast in the hotel is simple but sufficient. The Almas seemed to be one of the nicer hotels in the city and was known to all the taxi drivers I came across making it easy for getting around. The hotel has a nice roof terrace with a small outdoor swimming pool (although in December the pool is not heated so too cold to swim).,Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled solo,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chris-RDD

Hotel Almas,ellieh89 wrote a review Nov 2015,40,Booked a 4 night stay in Marrakech and stayed at hotel almas in gueliz.,I booked a 4 night stay in Hotel Almas in the down town area of Gueliz. The location was prime for getting to places with most sites walking distance or a short taxi fare away. The room itself was basic but clean and was perfect for coming back for a rest after a long day out in the hustle bustle. Although central it was off on a side street so wasn't to noisy at night either. The leaudyssee spa was only a stones throw away and treatments are affordable in comparison to other Hamam spas in Marrakech. Upstairs the terrace has some great views of city and pool is clean enough a bit cold at time of year but it would be nice in summer. The only downfall was the breakfast there wasn't a great variety and it was extremely repetitive. My advice opt out for breakfast and eat breakfast from one of many local cafes. Especially when breakfast is 55 dirhams per day you could easily manage to get breakfast elsewhere for that price.

Hotel Almas,Samy wrote a review Oct 2015,40,Great hotel,Stayed at Almas Hotel from 8th - 15Octoberall in all it was a great hotel. There were plenty of variety for breakfast however it was repetitive over the week. Our rooms got cleaned on a daily basis and the staff were really nice.    Unfortunately there is a sign when entering the hotel advising that food/drinks are not allowed to be brought in. The hotel wants its customers to purchase drinks and food from them however it is quite pricey. There is a shop on a side road right across the hotel so feel free to purchase a few items from there and obviously you would need to hide this when going back in to the hotel on a good note the hotel rooms have a fridge which was great.    There are a few restaurants right next to the hotel which serve great food the menus had fixed prices so you wont need to haggle. The only downside was that there are quite a few flies in most restaurants.    I would definitely recommend Almas hotel the view on the rooftop was amazing!,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"West Bromwich, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/544samyr
Hotel Almas,nemo474 wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Well Deserves Its Three Star Rating,My wife and I stayed here for eight nights. Contrary to some other reviewers we were well satisfied with our stay. Our room 110 was large had a huge comfortable bed good shower and effective air conditioning. We were at the back of the hotel on the same flooor as the restaurant and our large balcony overlooked neighbouring buildings.  The room was spotless and attended to each day. The staff were friendly and helpful. Rachid on the door and Khadija at reception deserve a mention.  Breakfasts were substantial but considering the cost and availability it was surprising the choice of fresh fruit alternated each day only between oranges and melon.  We found the location of the hotel just right being within walking distance of all the major attractions. Be aware when walking about Marrakech the lack of street signs makes navigation harder than usual. When in doubt grab a taxi. There were several restaurants nearby where the food was cheap and good.  One last minor point. When considering the internation profile of their guests the lack of an English speaking TV channel was surprising.,Date of stay: October 2015,,"County Wexford, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nemo474

Hotel Almas,JBBB1 wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Brilliant hotel in a great location,Our family of 6 stayed at the hotel for 10 days. The hotel is in a great area of the city located in the heart of the new city while only a 5 minute taxi from the old city. There are plenty of restaurants in the streets surrounding the hotel so getting something to eat is not a problem. It is just off the main road so you avoid the hustle and bustle and are not disturbed when in the hotel. The hotel is only a short drive from the airport a taxi will get you there in less than 20 minutes.  The staff are friendly and most speak English as well as French and Arabic. Breakfast had a wide variety even if it was slightly repetitive. Our rooms had a full A/C unit as well as a digital safe a tv and a fridge. The pool gets quite busy at times so it is best go either early after breakfast or late in the afternoon.  Our only complaint was that the Wi-Fi wasn't always reliable so getting into contact with family back home was a struggle sometimes. However on the whole we didn't spend much time sitting around anyway so it wasn't a huge issue.

Hotel Almas,John C wrote a review Aug 2015,50,Great break from the bustling city!,My family and I stayed in this hotel twice during our stay in Morocco. Our stay at this hotel was so pleasant that we had to return! I was quite skeptical when trip advisor said 'free breakfast' I was expecting a few stale rolls and a bruised apple. I was delighted to find that the breakfast was one of the best I have ever had in a hotel.  The hotel was incredibly clean and light. The pool was clean and great respite from the scorching heat of the city.  Finally I have to give a mention to the staff who went out of their way to help us. Didij the receptionist went to a lot of trouble to get us information on the local land marks and greeted us with a smile every time we came back to the hotel. Zuhir the baggage assistant was outstanding as he swiftly took our cases from us when we arrived and helped is to bring them to a taxi at the end of the trip. He helped us out a lot by directing the taxi driver to the right location saving us both time and money!

Hotel Almas,Margaret C wrote a review Aug 2015,50,Excellent,I was utterly happy with my stay at this hotel. My room was spotless and cleaned everyday. The bed was hard but still comfortable. The shower was also good and powerful. The AC was also very much welcomed. The balconies are small but effective. My room also had a fridge and again this was very handy. The breakfast that the hotel serves is continental. There is a variety of choices but after six days of the same thing you could be forgiven for being bored with the lack of choices.  The swimming pool and roof terrace are stunning and there is always beds to lie on. The pool life guard is extremely helpful too. Personally the snack bar on the rooftop terrace serves food that is sub-standard and it takes ages to get the order that you have placed. I would refrain from ordering or take your own snacks with you.  There are two women that rotate on reception. One is extremely pleasant and utterly helpful her name is Khalidja. Nothing was ever a problem for her. Meanwhile the other one was a surly faced unhelpful impudent person who was more interested in her mobile phone than helping residents!  The hotel itself is located a 2 minute walk from Mohammed V - extremely central - which is ideal. It is also surrounded by restaurants which were always really busy. The noise from the area can be loud but not so that you are kept awake. Overall I loved this hotel and would definitely stay there again and would definitely recommend it.,Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled solo,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/margaretc511

Hotel Almas,acceberhill wrote a review Jul 2015,40,Nice little stay,Visited here recently for 4 nights break with a friend and we had a fab time!    The hotel was in a great location in the new town for shops supermarket and restaurants and the old town (where Jemaa El Fna- the main square is located) is either around a 20 mins walk or a short taxi ride. I did like being in the new town because I felt a little safer and I think they are more accepting of how tourists dress here! But I did love the old town and you must visit it!!! That's where the real culture is.    Our room was a nice size very clean with a fridge TV and air con. Our room was located at the front - facing the road some reviews will tell you it's noisy there however we did not find this an issue even with it being Ramadan!    The rooftop pool was cute with a few sun loungers and towels were provided. It provided a nice view of the the city as well. Wasn't anything special but it made a nice break from walking around.    The continental breakfast was very basic but I still ate it everyday so it couldn't have been that bad and I did like the cute little yogurts!

Hotel Almas,Anna A wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Brilliant hotel after initially staying at a riad,Just returned from a great four night holiday with my mother.    We decided to stay here after reading reviews on the hotel and finding them to be good.  Originally we had booked a riad to stay at with our package but after staying for one night decided that it was not for us.    Arrived at the hotel to find a nice lobby and friendly staff who checked us in very promptly and arranged for the porter to take our bags to our room.    The room was very clean including the bathroom and bed linen which is always a must at any hotel.    The room consisted of two twin beds a small refrigerator seating area and a TV.    The hotel is located on a main road however we did not experience any noise as the window was closed at all times with the AC on full blast. With a country as hot as Morroco what more do expect?!    The pool area is nice the water is cool which is refreshing in 30+ degree heat.    The booking did come with breakfast however the breakfast was quite limited and we did not go again on the second day to try it.    The hotel staff are all very attentive and professional. The hotel is located in a very good area with local restaurants  a supermarket shops such as mango and a mcdonalds all a stone throw away.

Hotel Almas,Sususush wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Lovely little hotel.,Perfect for a long weekend suiting couples or solo travellers best.    Modern fixtures and fittings and beds are really really comfortable with good quality bed linen. The bed alone would make me go back.    Room was carpeted and had a small seating area alongside a small fridge electronic safe and LG flat screen TV. No tea making facilities but this appears to be the norm in Morocco. Bathroom was spotless and had walk-in shower.    I should advise that English speaking TV channels were limited to BBC News and a film channel but I didn't find this a problem.    It is situated on a main road so you have to expect associated noise. There is double glazing so you may opt to keep the window closed and solely rely on air-con. I only stayed one night but I think there may be a few rear facing rooms.    Has a small roof top pool which I didn't use but it was nice to go up there to watch the sun go down over the city as the room had no balcony.    Staff were friendly and professional    Ideally located for local amenities such as the shopping complex which is a 5 minute walk away on Mohammed V Avenue. You can also catch the number 1 bus to the souk/medina on the opposite side of the road to the shopping centre and one of the official gardens is a short walk from the hotel.    I much preferred taking the local bus (4 dirhams) as it was jut too hot to spend time haggling with taxi drivers. It was also nice just taking an aimless bus ride during the day to people watch.    There are several traditional restaurants in very close proximity including next door so there is no excuse for you not to try authentic food what's the point travelling if you don't take in new experiences? If your taste buds are set in their ways there are also Western fast-food outlets nearby.    If this hotel is a three star (can't see rating while writing review) it can only be down to the size of the hotel or something silly like not having baths etc as there was nothing wrong with the quality of what was provided.

Hotel Almas,Kay W wrote a review Jun 2015,40,Brilliant location!,Just returned from a great 4 night break with a friend (we are both 24 year old females) and have so much to say about this holiday some of it I'd wish I'd have known before I went.    The Hotel...  - Location was ideal very close to plenty of restaurants and modern shops such as Mango Monsoon etc. and around a 20 minute walk to the Medina where you'll find Jemaa El Fna (the main square) the souks and old town. We never paid more than 30 dirhams (£2) for a taxi to the medina.  - The room was a great size and the air con was a blessing! Our room faced the main road and before visiting we had read lots of reviews saying we should ask for a room with a balcony on the back of the hotel due to noise from the road on arrival no rooms with a balcony were available on that day but we're told we could try again the next day. However we never found the noise to be an issue as we kept the window closed.  - There wasn't a hair dryer in the room but I'd taken my own so never enquired as to whether the hotel could provide one.  - The rooftop pool was lovely! A little chilly when you first get in but so thankful we booked a hotel with a pool to cool off in the 35+ degree heat! The decking gets so hot as it absorbs the heat so we had to keep our shoes on right until stepping into the pool!  - I wouldn't go crazy for the breakfast. It was a bit basic with your typical continental style...2 choices of cereals croissants bread rolls cheese fruit pancakes and boiled eggs were available.    Other aspects of the holiday that I'd like to share;  Money...Morocco is a closed country only a limited amount of money can be imported or exported. What we weren't advised about was to keep the reciept from when we changed our money into Dirhams. We tried to change our money back in Gueliz at a Western Union but they had no GBP so we planned to change it at the airport. I had 2240 dirhams left over but as we didn't have an exchange receipt the most The would let me change back was 2000 dirhams.    - Jemaa el Fna and the souks are a definite must see! Prepare to be hassled by everyone you come across but it is definitely an experience. On the way out Taxi drivers will openly argue and steal each other's business. We didn't feel comfortable with this so we walked away from 2 arguing drivers and flagged down a passing driver.    - If you go for Street food in Jemaa el Fna make sure you agree a price before you sit down. We were given a menu that said 35 dirhams each (about £2) but they kept bringing dishes that we didn't ask for then when the bill came they wanted 280 dirhams (nearly £20!) while the food was nice and the atmosphere was buzzing we were left a bit disheartened.    - Bartering in the souks is so much fun! If they don't make a sale they will run after you in the street and continue to negotiate a price but usually caved at this point and took the price we offered. We were looking at leather rucksacks with Moroccan carpet and looked at multiple stores for different designs. We were offered anything between 200 dirhams (approx. £17) - 8000 dirhams (approx £520)!! Shop keepers would also disappear and come back with alternative designs.    - We went for a walk around the Medina on out last day and managed to get lost around the souks/Berber market. Some locals would lead us some of the way back to the main square but as I never learnt French understanding their directions was a little difficult. After ending up in the residential part of the medina one local walked us back to the main square but then asked for a coin as a way of thanks. Unfortunatly I only had 1.5 dirhams and he didn't hide his disappointment when this was all I could offer.    - As we travelled during Ramadan everything went a little quiet between around 4pm -10pm.    - We booked an excursion on our way out of Jeema el Fna. We paid 300 dirhams each (£20) for a trip to the Atlas Mountains which included a 30minute camel ride a stop to see how Argan oil is made a hike up the mountains to see a very impressive waterfall a tour around a traditional Berber house and a stop at a riverside restaurant where we sat in the stream to have lunch.

Got to say it was an excellent choice. The reception staff on arrival were really helpful and spoke good English...the porter took us straight to our room which faced the front of the hotel on the 2nd floor  room was comfy with a huge double bed air con etc breakfast was continental and plenty of it...on the roof is a pool which is most welcome with 30 degree temperatures... Unfortunately it's only 0.75 mts deep ? Towels are supplied by the hotel and the attendant keeps it all spotless there's a pretty spectacular view from the roof across the city as most buildings are no more than 6 story's high ! This is were expecting the unexpected helps ... The road outside the hotel was akin to a cross between a race track and a pathway?? No one walked on the footpath and no one drove cars with brakes ??! To cross any road in the city takes nerves of steelthe main road into town and to the main souks is one block away and is lined with restaurants and tea shops ...buses down to the market are frequent and easy to use....you can walk down into the old city but it will take a good half hour  once there during the day you will meet snake charmers who will try to prise as much money out of u as possible  I can only say "" a refusal often offends"" so if your not interested just walk away the Moroccans are experts at selling you stuff you don't really need but haggling is all part of the ride in this city.  You can go into the souk all the way down to the tannery where leather is produced... But the smell is pretty awful and it's pretty easy to get lost and to be led out will require a tip .... The souk in the evening is a completely different place and comes alive with a abundance of street food stalls all fighting for your business. There are dancers and snake charmers and street players acting out comedy type sketches??it really comes alive !! With a large screen facing the souk showing continuos laurel and hardy films it seems Moroccans love their comedy !! The food was fantastic and the smells just lingered in the air ....it did give up a few shocks as its a pretty poor country and as such you will find a lot of beggars on the streets !?

Hotel Almas,Victoria B wrote a review Apr 2015,40,Lovely stay at Almas,Stayed for 4 nights at hotel Almas. We had a pleasant stay after waiting in reception for 20mins on arrival we were upgraded to a suite. We had a comfy bed spacious room big wardrobe and a little balcony. The shower was good and there was a travel hair dryer provided. Food was quite nice and there was a decent sized selection. We stayed half board but we found the evening meal a little strange as we were the only diners on 2 of the evenings so we also ate out. Hotel staff were generally friendly but not overly helpful. The roof top pool is lovely and though it's not heated it is still bearable on a hot day! Would definitely recommend this hotel to friends. As others have mentioned it's walking distance from the Yves st. Laurent gardens and medina perfect location for us. There is a supermarket in the nearby shopping centre which sells alcohol you can keep it cool in the mini fridge.,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/805victoriab

Hotel Almas,MrMcFly1985 wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Excellent Value. Amazing Roof Terrace.,Just returned from a 4 night stay. Whilst the hotel is about 20 minutes from the old town (perfect distance for me) the surrounding area is home to a wealth of bars and restaurants.  The hotel itself is very well appointed with very comfortable beds and ample sized bathrooms. The balconies are a good touch too.  Breakfast was just what I wanted a selection of meat and cheese with yoghurts eggs and salad. Really tasty.  The best kept secret of this hotel is however the beautiful roof terrace with amazing views of the Atlas Mountains and the city itself. Get up there early though as sunbathing spots are limited and worth it!

Note they won't allow you to bring your own food/drink inside.    The reception will organise excursions that run everyday and pick you up.

Hotel Almas,Kamil N wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Great hotel and well priced,Stayed a week mid March in the hotel. The location itself is perfect about 20min walk to Medina walking distance to all other landmarks.  Hotel is located in central Gueliz close to the restaurants and cafes. Just down the road is supermarket where all essentials including alcohol can be bought.  Room was spacious nicely decorated and fairly large It had a balcony that was nice to use after day of walking.  The swimming pool at the roof is an added bonus the pool is not heated but on hot day is all you really need decking around it got loungers and umbrellas.  Staff was friendly and helpful and even kept our luggage for 5 h on our last day after checkout.  Only downside was:  Air con did not work - did not report it as keeping balcony doors open kept the room cool  Water in the shower didn't drain too quick - after two people showering it was like a paddle - again did not bother me at all.    Overall great place to stay.,Date of stay: March 2015,,"Worthing, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/544kamiln
Hotel Almas,Instapav wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Perfect for Supratours,We stayed here for two nights on our way back from Essaouira.    We had a triple occupancy room which was clean and very comfortable. Wifi worked well in the room and around the hotel.    The rooftop pool/sun deck was excellent and very popular with our 3 year old daughter.    Breakfast was good considering the price of the room. There was a range of pastries breads cheeses yogurt etc.    Location was great for the Supratours - walking distance from the depot or a short cab ride if you have baggage.    The airport was around 10 mins drive by petit taxi. This cost us 80dh.    We walked to the square/souks (30 mins) and the Majorelle gardens (20 mins) but both were only a cheap cab ride away (20-25 dh depending on your haggling skills!)    There are lots of budget restauants on the street outside or some higher end options just 5 mins walk away at place 16 November.    The staff we encountered were all very courteous and professional.    We would definitely recommend this hotel as a good value base for transiting Marrakech or some creature comforts on a budget.,Date of stay: March 2015,,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Instapav
Hotel Almas,MariuszPL wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Superb hotel in great location!,It is 3 star hotel but I would rate is as a 4 stars due to its staff very good breakfast spacious rooms cleanliness and nice little pool on the roof with showers and toilets (pool towels are also supplied).    The reception staffs are really helpful and speak English. The rooms have fridge LCD TV and are cleaned every day and they are spotless. Unfortunately they don’t have safe but it is not an issue. Our room which was standard room had two double beds and nice balcony with table and chairs. When we arrived we requested a room which wasn’t facing the main street (due to the noise and smell from the restaurants) and there was no problem to get it.    The breakfast is from 6:30 until 10:00. The selection (check my pictures) is really good and fresh juices are amazing.    The location is superb. In the new town Gueliz about 20mins walk to Jemma el Fna square or a short taxi ride 20-30MAD or just 4MAD for a bus ticket (you buy ticket from the driver).    That is all to say about the hotel. I definitely recommend to stay in Almas Hotel.    We took the taxi from the airport to the hotel– 100MAD in the evening (higher rates-but don’t go to the taxi car park with old Mercedes taxis just in front of the entrance-go straight up the stairs and there is car park for visitors-just wait there for the petit taxi like daciapunto uno etc) and back from the hotel to airport for 50MAD (just wait in front of the hotel –there is plenty of them around). Write the price on the paper and ask the driver if he accepts it. If not there will be another taxi. Even after agreeing the price they still tried to ask for more be firm and just laugh-don’t pay any more!    Now it is time to mention places to eat and visiting Marrakech attractions.    Choice of restaurants and bars around the hotel is huge. The cheapest bar and very good with loads of locals just the first one on the left when you leave hotel. Next on the left is Winoo restaurant with great and cheap fruit and juice cocktails (15-20MAD) – unfortunately the tagines are really tiny so I wouldn’t recommend it for main meal. Opposite of Winoo on the corner there is a fish restaurant-really good you choose what you want and they cook it fresh for you (240MAD for the dinner for two-huge plates with prawns and squids).    The attractions in Marrakech:    First day – take a taxi (max 30MAD) or walk to Majorelle Gardens. Take a taxi (30MAD-40Max) to Bab Debbagh to see tanneries. Spend a while walking around and next go along the main round Rue de bab debbagh into the city centre. On the way on the right side Maison de la Photografie with café on the roof. Next visit Ben Youseff Medersa and Marrakech Museum (buy combined ticket).Next walk through souks to Jemaa el Fna square and next see Koutubia Mosque and finally relax in Koutubia Gardens. Take a 20-30mins walk to hotel - walk through Cyber Park.    Second day – take a taxi (30MAD) to Bahia Palace. Next visit Maison Tiskwin and Dar Si Said if you like museums. Come back to Bahia Palace and walk south to see Jewish synagogue-hided-so follow signs to Riad 73. Next Jewish Cemetery and walk back through Jewish part of the town (lots of little alleys) to El Badi Palace and Royal Palace. Afterwards take a walk to west to Kasbah Mosque and Saadian Tombs and the most famous gate of Marrakech – Bab Agnaou. Walk north to Jemma el Fna  relax in one of the roof cafes and walk back to the hotel.    Third day – do a day trip to Atlas Mountains – Ourika Valley for 200MAD (250MAD if you buy in hotel) per person or Izmil 500MAD or 3 valleys for 1000MAD (they are called smart holidays-they don’t have any signboard but they will give you a leaflet) – buy them on the way to the hotel when you walk from Jemaa square to the hotel on the right side-about 300-400 metres from Koutubia.

Hotel Almas,Paula M wrote a review Mar 2015,40,"perfectly fine hotel, great location",my husband and I stayed here for two nights. Great location.  The room was large and clean toiletries available but I was glad I took my travel hairdryer.  Breakfast was fine rolls eggs cheese and yogurts.  Wifi great in reception but less so in the room.  We were at the front of the hotel and it was noisy the air con didn't want to work so it was hot. If we'd stayed longer I may have asked to move. Roof top pool was lovely but the water was prohibitively cold! I also think the hotel management team should consider buying some chairs not just the handful of loungers. Really good hotel. Tips - buy dirhams in the airport do not pay more that 70 - 100 dirhams for a taxi from airport to hotel and only 25 - 30 for a trip to the square. You can walk there we went via the cyber park (gardens) and it was lovely a real contrast from the hustle and bustle. We visited the market during the day and then went back one evening complete contrast we enjoyed sitting in the cafes people watching. Loads of noise but felt safe. On our daytime trip we ended up in one of the tanneries we were then 'made' to go into the shop we didn't buy anything so we're hassled for money for the tour (which had lasted 2 minutes) they wanted 300 dirhams (£18/19) we said no and were surrounded by men we agreed to pay 100 and hurried off. We didn't buy anything in the markets but it was interesting to wander round. There are monkeys and Cobras performing which is sad. I thought the ponies looked well looked after but felt terribly sad for the donkeys.  When at the airport even if you have checked in on line you need to get your boarding card stamped at the airline desk and fill in a boarding card.  We would recommend this hotel but would suggest a room at the back or check the air con is working. If you're looking for a lovely meal - Amira is around the corner lovely food wine and cocktails. We went back the 2nd night too. 16 in the plaza was lovely for coffee and cake. With 16 on your left and KFC on your right you will see the mosque at the end of the road head down there take your life into your hands at the crossings and use the park as a respite.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Walmer, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulam866
Hotel Almas,stalbans12 wrote a review Mar 2015,40,Nice hotel,As a group of 4 we emailed the Almas Hotel a few weeks before travelling to ask for a double and twin room. Correspondence with the hotel was prompt and helpful. We arrived at the hotel before 11am and only had to wait 5 minutes for the first room to be ready and 15 min for the second to be available. We were given 2 rooms next to each other – a double and twin – just as we had requested.    The rooms were exceptionally clean and tidy. There was a fridge (no mini bar) and a safe was available on request at no extra charge. There were no UK TV channels but that’s not the reason why you travel to Marrakech! There was however one channel which mostly showed movies in English (with Arabic subtitles)    The bathroom was very clean. The bed was firm but comfy. The windows did an average job keeping out the noise from outside at night but no so that it didn’t stop us from having a good night’s sleep. It might be quieter in a room facing the rear of the hotel.    The buffet continental breakfast was a good selection served daily; egg ham cheese fresh bread. Pancakes porridge and cereal were also available and the whole offering filled us up enough to face the hectic souks.    The pool was clean but freezing when we were there (March). The area around the pool was a great place to relax in the sunshine.    The staff were helpful attentive and friendly. They helped us book a trip to the Atlas mountains and helped with all of the queries with no problems whatsoever.    Our only downside was the distance to the old town. It’s about a 30 min walk but it’s easy to get a taxi.,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"St. Albans, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stalbans12

Hotel Almas,Henri K wrote a review Feb 2015,40,Pleasant stay at Almas,I spent a week here alone at the end of January. As a solo female traveller to Morocco I booked this as part of a package from EasyJet with transfers and flights. Upon arrival I was checked in quite quickly and taken to my room by the porter. First impressions were that it was a very spacious room with a rather large bed. Very clean bathroom and shower all spotless. I was given a room on the second floor looking out onto the street. I would recommend asking for a room on the other side of the hotel if you are a light sleeper as the noise can get a bit much with the amount of honking that goes on as the hotel street backs on to the main street in Gueliz. Also if you are a smoker there isn't a balcony on this side just a small smoking area in the room which I found a little confusing not having had a smoking room before leaving the room smelling a bit unpleasant! Beds were comfortable with adequate amounts of pillows. There is a mini fridge in the room however on the entrance to the hotel there is a notice reminding guests that bringing food and drink into the hotel is prohibited so the reason for the mini fridge is a little unclear. Shower gel and shampoo etc are thoughtfully provided. When I arrived the receptionist that checked me in never mentioned the pool on the roof so I was unsure whether or not it was open being the end of January. I stayed half board at the hotel breakfast is served from 6.30am which is useful if you are setting off early on excursions. There is a good variety of continental breakfast. Dinner is one menu with a choice of starter which wasn't bad however I did opt to eat out 5 nights of the 7 the two that I ate there being the first night and after a particularly long day. The chef was very friendly however a couple of the waiting staff seemed a bit miserable but weren't rude. It is quite annoying that they don't want you to bring any outside food or drink in if you wanted a snack or something. However there are a few nice places to eat in the vicinity a five minute walk around the hotel will take you to at least twenty restaurants all which either were or looked lovely. There are some nice bars in the area too as it is the new town I particularly liked Level 5 just opposite McDonalds and a Jazz bar a couple of streets away. It's a short walk to the medina and a twenty minute or so walk in the other direction from the Majorelle Gardens definitely worth a visit! There are several trips that are available from Marrakech itself which if you are there for longer than a weekend are definitely a must do. Marrakech is a very bustling lively city and having spent a day or two looking round the sights such as the Bahia palace Medersa Ben Yousef the souks etc you will probably want to head out of the city for a day or so. Ourika valley and the waterfalls are lovely the seaside town of Essaouira is a couple of hours away and a nice day out and you can spend a day going to Ait Ben Haddou and Ouarzazate in the beginnings of the Sahara if you head through the Atlas Mountains.    All in all a very decent hotel in a great location I enjoyed my stay here and would recommend it.,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled solo,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HenriK536

I had a room on the first floor... although the room was not to far from the kitchen and restaurant the room was very quiet... it had a small balcony with a chair and table if you smoked.. I don't so just opened it for fresh air. The hotel is located in a back street which looks a bit rough... but I can assure you the area is perfectly safe. the hotel is about 30 minute walk from the Medina which I was very glad about..... it was bliss to get from the hustle and bustle of the square. Breakfast was included with my room but I didn't bother with it so I cant comment on what it was like..... The hotel is situated in the new district of Marrakech and has plenty of places to eat from MCds KFC or Moroccan style foods. The only aspect of my 4 night stay which could of been better was the TV only had one English channel..... apart from that I could not fault this place... on the day I checked out I asked the manager if I could have a late check out.... this was granted at no extra charge.....

Hotel Almas,madsox74 wrote a review Nov 2014,40,Lovely and friendly,Hotel is basic but very clean and tidy reception staff can't do enough to help. We arrived at hotel about 22:00 check in was quick and easy our room didn't have a safe but we requested one at reception which was delivered to our room within an hour free of charge. There is a lovely little bar in the street opposite the hotel next to the fresh fruit shop with a few food shops but be on your guard crossing the roads. The seafood bar on the corner to the left is fab but very busy at all times as well as the smoothie bar both places are basic but nice and cheap enough.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Sunderland, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/madsox74
Hotel Almas,Geraldine F wrote a review Nov 2014,40,Great place and they will look after your luggage for you.,Stayed here on my first night in Morocco. Very clean and friendly reception staff. The room was big and had balcony and small fridge. The shower was excellent  the toilet was in a strange position behind the door  nearly knocked myself out getting to it. The porter brought my bags into the room when we arrived and left without looking for a tip. The room is a good size and beds are very comfortable. Found the breakfast room very bland in decor. The food was the same  just something missing from the breakfast. Seemed to be processed food although the buffet looked impressive it looked like something out of the 70's. We left the hotel early the next morning to get to the Supratours depot which was on the side of the train station about 10 minutes walk up the road. We hadn't booked our tickets and had to wait over 3 hours for the next bus. There was no left luggage in the bus station or the train station. I didn't fancy walking around with a big suitcase so went back to the hotel who had no problem minding our cases for us for the 3 hours and also recommended a lovely garden for us to visit about 20 minutes walk up the road and showed us how to get there. Six days later we were back in Marrakesh to fly back home. I had tried to source a left luggage place but couldn't so we went back to Hotel Almas and asked if they would look after our bags for the day. Again the staff were very helpful and looked after them for the whole day. They did not ask for money although we tipped the porter who looked surprised when I tipped him. They advised me how much money to pay the taxi man to get to the Medina. They were so friendly at a time when I needed them to be as I didn't want to have my suit case with me for the whole day walking around on a very hot day. Area where the hotel is is full of local food places we ate in a pizza bar next door and had a cheap and cheerful meal really lovely fresh juices were on the menu although I only tried the orange juice. It was my first night and as a female traveling with my teenage daughter I didn't want to go too far until I got familiar with my surroundings. Hotel Almas felt very safe.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeraldineF211

Perfect location to discover the new town and also not far from the historical sites and the Medina. We really love this hotel and can recommend it to everybody at any time.

One of our group had a couple of maintenance issues but these were dealt with very quickly. The aircon and fridge both worked well. The rooftop pool had quite good views. It is not heated but this hardly matters in Morocco. the food was OK if a bit predictable. The hotel is dry. The Wifi worked well. Only CNN English speaking TV.

Hotel Almas,ShabirPatel wrote a review Aug 2014,40,Hotel Almas,We booked 2 rooms for our family at this hotel.    The staff are very friendly and the majority spoke english. On the first day I discovered that my european travel adaptor was not compatible so I was unable to charge my phone. The young man at reception was kind enough to let me borrow his charger which was very nice of him.    The breakfast is limited in selection but it is very tasty and after a week of it we never got bored of it.    Kids made good use of the pool on the rooftop and the rooms were spacious. Although the hotel is rated as 3 star I would probably class it more as a top end 3 star heading towards a 4 star.    The stay was reasonably comfortable and the air conditioning was a godsend.However on 2 nights we got constant knocking noises all night as if there were workmen working on our floor.    We had 2 rooms one which faced the road (had no balcony) and the other facing the rear (which had the balcony). I would certainly recommend trying to get one at the back as it is a little quieter    On the bad side of things we did report the shower light had stopped working on day 3 no-one ever came to repair it so we left it.    Overall a good stay and certainly a hotel that represents excellent value for money and is pretty central. Carre Eden shopping mall is a 3 minute walk and has some good shops including the Carrefore Supermarket. There is also a nice food court on the top floor of Carre Eden where there is a good selection of food and dessert places.    We tried Al Bahriya next to the hotel which does some good fish platters. We read the reviews on tripadvisor and checked it out. I would probably rate it about 7/10. Also tried Winoos which was also next door. The food there I would say was also 7/10 but their Smoothies are definitely excellent.    The main square is about a 20 minute walk from the hotel and the best time to visit the square is after sunset.......it comes to life at night !!!!    The hotel has free wifi although we found that most of the time you either couldn't connect to the internet or it was extremely slow.    Overall a pleasant stay apart from a few minor issues.

Hotel Almas,ckwl wrote a review Jul 2014,50,Friendly and helpful. Enjoyable stay,Location:  The hotel is situated in the Gueliz of Marrakech. The hotel is easily recognisable by its blue neon sign on the top of the hotel at night. There are a few restaurants near by which have good ratings on Tripadvisor such as Amaia and Al Bahriya.    Getting around:  Getting to Place Jemaa El Fna by petit taxis cost around 20 to 30dh (most expensive at night I wouldn't pay more than 40dh. Getting from and to the airport costed us 40dh after some haggling. Otherwise walking to the walk takes about 25 mins with some nice gardens on the way.    Service:  The staff were friendly and speaks reasonably good english. The porter took us to our room but did not even expect any tips. The rooms were cleaned and tidied daily.There is a swimming pool and some sunbeds on the roof (closes at 20:00) with towels provided. Wifi is free and needs no password. No deposit was required on arrival.There is tourist tax which you can pay on arrival or check out. It was 11dh per person per night. You can also book excursions from the hotel which were reasonable price. (We went on a day trip to Ait Benhaddou & Ouarzazate for 350 dh each). Breakfast was continental and starts from 06:30.    Room:  We stayed in a triple room which had 3 large beds. Pretty comfortable and clean. There is a small fridge in the room. TV and good air conditioning. Although please be aware they do not provide toothbrush and toothpaste so bring your own.    Overall we had a lovely stay at this hotel. Everything ran smoothly with no problems. If you like sea food the restaurant next door Al Bahriya is a must try. You can even get a great take away from there for 40dh.,Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,Brighton,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ckwl
Hotel Almas,ToscaSalomeLouis25 wrote a review Jun 2014,50,"Comfortable, Value for Money",This is the 2nd time we have stayed at the hotel. I come to marrakech every year for business but bring my husband as we enjoy the city the sunshine the culture the food. Previously we have stayed in the Medina - there is no doubt the Riads are beautiful but Hotel Almas is by far the way to go. It's a close walk to the Medina to get into the hustle and bustle but offers a much more calm comfortable experience.    All rooms are air conditioned (a major plus!) great value for money - not to mention the beds are HUGE! We enjoyed the rooftop pool on this occasion which was great to get some sun and then cool off.    There are heaps of great restaurants around the hotel in walking distance. We love Cafe de la Poste and Bagatelle just around the corner. Great value and excellent food. It;s easy to get a taxi from right outside and the staff all speak excellent english.

Hotel Almas,81mikew27 wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Good value for money !,Am staggered by some of the comments about the Hotel Almas - the breakfasts were typical continental breakfasts...perhaps some of the reviewers were expecting a full English complete with bacon and pork sausages !  The rooms were spacey and clean and our room was cleaned every day unless we put the 'Do not disturb' sign on the door handle.  As for the reception staff - we found them friendly and helpful - we were given a map and where we wanted to go was marked on the map for us. Most spoke at least passable English some good.  Would we stay there again....undoubtedly yes !

Hotel Almas,Kathy M wrote a review Jun 2014,10,Never again!,This was my first time at this hotel and I was not impressed. The breakfast was bland and the same thing was served everyday They only served dry bread rolls two selection of pastry the only hot food there was boiled eggs and pancakes which felt like eating rubber. Could not communicate with the hotel staff at reception unless you spoke Arabic or French. Staff was very unhelpful every time you asked for help they would just seem uninterested.    There was no wifi connection in the pool area. I'm shocked that no one used the pool during my stay It was freezing cold! You had to ask to have the bed sheets changed and the housekeeping staff did not understand. There was so many times we were disturbed whilst in our room as they kept entering without knocking and walking in and walked out when they realised we were there. Definitely need to have some sort or hanger to say Do Not Disturb! The shower was so weak no refreshments in the room. There's also a sign saying no food or drink to be taken into the rooms! Lamps were not working had to change our key card like 5 times because it would not open our door.    I was really worried at the security of this hotel. There was no safe in the rooms. Even on the last day we left our luggage in the room near reception people were just helping themselves in the room to get their belongings anyone can take your stuff was not monitored at all! Apart from it's in a good location.

We had a fab stay at Hotel Almas it was a really great location - at the centre of the new town with plenty of bars and restaurants and just a 20 mins straight easy walk into the main square of the Medina. Its location was a perfect antidote to the utter manic Medina.    The staff were really helpful and friendly and the room and breakfast was really nice. It was also great to have the decking area and small swimming pool on the roof which was really lovely and towels were provided. This was a fantastic way to end a busy dusty day in the Medina.

Be sure to check different hotel finding websites as they can differ considerably in price for the same room same dates. Very clean spacious lobby and clean working lifts. Room was large with excellent aircon nice large walk in shower and no problems with hot water supply. great to have fridge in room. Roof top pool nice but need more sunbeds too few to accommodate guests who wish to swim/sunbathe. Staff are very helpful and speak good English this makes up for lack of any written info in the room about the hotel/area/attractions. Post office is at the end of the street you can mail box home to yourself if you buy too much to cope with the budget airline baggage allowances!! Special mention to the hotel receptionists Hicham and Mohammed who anticipate what you need and Imad and Rachid porters who helped with luggage/taxis.

A lot of the time there was only us there so felt like our own private pool - towels provided which is a big plus. The hotel is central to everything both the new town and the old.

Super clean spacious room with the best shower we have had in a hotel for years!! Great A/C and a room fridge (very handy in the heat)!! The breakfast was everything we expected too.  As other reviews have commented its in the new part of town and a good 25 mins walk to the old town... It was super hot whilst we where there so we ended up doing the city bus tour to cool down and rest our very sore feet!  We found our visit very cheap as others have said I think in total we spent £100......  Highly recommend the little fish restaurant( friuts de mer) around 3 to the left of the hotel it's a small ""sister"" of the huge fish restaurant on the corner we stumbled across it on our first evening and it was the best meal we had we returned again for our final meal!

Hotel Almas,hc64 wrote a review Apr 2014,30,Good stay - helpful staff - but we stayed too long!,"After reading all the great reviews on Trip Advisor I was happy to book this stay in Marrakech.  It's obvious that the hotel have been spending money to improve and it was absolutely spotlessly clean throughout.  The rooftop pool was a bonus but it wasn't heated so was freezing and we couldn't use it - even on very hot days.  The reception staff were really helpful and friendly with great English and they made us feel very welcome.  The restaurant staff however were  the total opposite! We weren't offered a drink with our meal until our 3rd night! Then we found out a 1.5L bottle of water was 20 dirhams (About £1.50) - you can buy a 5L from round the corner for 10 - just to put it into perspective! We only made that mistake once!  Every evening you have one choice of meal - one meat one veg plus spagetti/pasta  (really strange mix of food not very Moroccan but tasted good and obviously the hotel have to cater for a variety of pallets!)  The fact it was so limited was was the most disappointing factor for me.  However they did have a lot of salad and sometimes had a soup.  There were plenty of local restaurants and I probably would have preferred to eat out and try them instead!  The breakfast was good but quite basic although there were pastries which were delicious!  The hotel is in the NEW TOWN of Marrakech. We didn't enjoy the new town as the main attraction seemed to be the McDonalds!  The old town - where the Souks and main ""attractions"" were was about 25 min walk away.  We stayed for 5 days but wouldn't recommend it as we saw everything we wanted to see in 3 days and found ourselves just going for long walks to kill time!

Hotel Almas,Davina-Jeff wrote a review Mar 2014,40,Great Stay In A Convenient Location,Myself and my husband stayed at this lovely hotel for 5 nights. Check in was quick and the man behind the reception desk was very pleasant and spoke good English.  Our room 214 was big and clean with doors leading out onto a private balcony. There was a big wardrobe along with shelving a dressing tablea fridge and TV. The room was cleaned daily along with towel change and toiletries replenished. Free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel.  The breakfast was served from 0630-1030 A variety of cereals pastries bread rolls boiled eggs yogurt jam honey semolina cheese cold meat olives dried and fresh fruit nuts orange juice and coffee. You can eat in the restaurant or outside on the terrace. The restaurant also serves evening meals but we didn't eat there.  There's a swimming pool along with sun loungers up on the roof which we didn't use but it looked spotlessly clean. Towels are also provided. All of the communal areas were clean and well looked after and all of the staff we encountered were friendly. I would definitely go back to this hotel if I was to visit Marrakech again.    The hotel is in a convenient location away from the hustle and bustle of the medina but is only a 20 minute walk away. It's situated in Gueliz an area that has plenty of cafes and restaurants to suit any budget. I would definitely recommend eating at the restaurants where the locals eat rather than the tourist places. You will also find MacDonalds and KFC on the main road walking toward the old town.  All the places of interest are within walking distance if you like to walk. There's also 2 big supermarkets which we came across one which sell alcohol.    When you arrive at the airport you will need to change your money into Dirhams. We changed £300 but only spent about £100 so best to try work out how much you may need. We only needed money for food and drink as we traveled light and didn't intend on buying tourist tat to bring home! There's English speaking places within the town where you can change money too if you feel you need to change more. However in town they do not change your money back to your own currency they only do that for the Moroccan residents. If you have money left you need to change it back to your currency when you arrive back at the airport before you go through security. Dirhams cannot be used in duty free. You can use your own currency or euros in duty free and change is given in euros. There's 2 duty free shops in the airport. Check out the prices in both before you buy anything as we found that one was considerably cheaper than the other.  100 Dirhams is about £7.30    We got the number 19 bus from the airport. You tell the driver which hotel you are staying at and he drops you close then gives you directions to reach it. We bought a return ticket for 50 Dirhams each. A return ticket allows you travel back to the airport within 2 weeks. When you go for the bus to go back to the airport just wait by the road where you were dropped off and when you see the bus put your hand out for it to stop. There's no bus stops! The journey only takes about 10-15 minutes and the buses are every half hour.    The driver dropped us outside MacDonalds. Cross over the main road to the phone shop opposite MacDonalds. Turn left down the next street and cross to the other side of the road then take the second right and you will find Hotel Almas a 2 minute walk away    Marrakech is a busy place with lots of traffic so be careful when crossing the roads. People are friendly. The souks are amazing and no doubt you will get lost. If this happens and you see a group tour then tag onto that and you will eventually get out! The food is delicious and the smoothies from the stalls too. I would recommend a mixed one. I only came across a couple of those stalls in the souks so if you do find one try it. They are only 5 Dirhams about 35p. You can also get an ice cream in the square for 2 Dirhams!,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leeds, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Davina-Jeff
Hotel Almas,cheeky_m0nkey9 wrote a review Mar 2014,30,Good hotel with plenty near by.,I stayed here in February 2014 for 6 nights as part of a week-long stay in the city. The hotel itself is clean well looked after with polite helpful staff. The room was large with a huge bed and space to sit and relax. The TV had a number of channels including English channels and a World news channel in French. The room also had heavy curtains (which helped make the room dark) Air-con (although ours didn't appear to work) a fridge and a nice big bathroom and a very comfortable shower. The hotel had a rooftop pool which was freezing cold but actually quite refreshing and in the heat of the day was nice to dip your feet in. The roof had towels sun loungers and a decent view as well. A nice place to chill with a book and soak up some sun away from the craziness at the ground level below.    I do however have a few issues with the rooms:  The rooms had no safe which meant we felt like we had to hide valuables away or take them with us daily;  The air con didn't seem to have any effect what so ever (and it was a hot week when we were there);  The rooftop pool could have done with more loungers as one large family could have occupied the lot in one go; and  The walls were extremely thin to the point that we could hear everything from our very 'active' neighbours.    This final point did become a nuisance as we heard voices TVs and shouting at all hours from the next door couple/family (it sounded like a herd of elephants) and then late night/early morning I was regularly woken up to interesting sounds from beyond the wall.    With regards to the location if you accept you a good 30 minutes’ walk from the central square and night market then it's great. Those that think it's a leisurely stroll there are mistaken. The walk is straight forward but contains mad dashes across roads and is very noisy all day (although equally well lit on an evening which was good). The new town location is close to loads of bars and good restaurants and has a little supermarket a short walk away. But for those that want a more central location a hotel nearer the walls or a riad in the centre are better options.,Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leeds, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cheeky_m0nkey9

Hotel Almas,Pauline453 wrote a review Mar 2014,40,Interesting short spring break.,We came to Marrakesh as a last minute alternative for somewhere to take a short spring break with some sun. This hotel lives up to the other reviews - basic but clean with helpful staff. There were several places to eat nearby and food was very cheap.  The pool area on the roof was clean and well cared for but we did not use it - the weather was pleasantly warm but not really hot enough in mid March for a dip. It was not very large.  Our room was ok. Two large beds pushed together to make an enormous double. Not much choice on tv but free wifi with good reception. We were on the 5th floor facing the road and did not find the city noise intrusive.  All in all I would recommend as a budget hotel located close to everything you want in Marrakesh.,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Braintree, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pauline453
Hotel Almas,Chris T wrote a review Mar 2014,50,A very good 3-star hotel!,For the amount I paid for this hotel I set my expectations low and didn't expect much. First impressions I thought the check in was a bit unproffesional and the amount of English spoken by the staff slightly lacking. Despite this the hotel room was large and comfortable with a large double bed and a beautiful shower. In addition the location was ideal just a 20-25 minute walk to the old town as well as some lovely restaurants and cafe's in the area to visit.    On a warm day it was nice to enjoy the rooftop pool area which was an added bonus considering the amount I paid for this hotel.

Strange toilet position with a wall in the way making it awkward to use.  Food was quite random: Some evenings there was a small buffet with limited choices and other evenings I was just given a meal without any choices.  Swimming pool was uncomfortably cold.

Hotel Almas,JenSurname wrote a review Mar 2014,40,"Clean, convenient, safe and friendly","This is a hotel that's away from the hustle and bustle of the medina but is only a 20 minute stroll away. It's situated in Gueliz an area that is plentiful with cafes and restaurants to suit any budget.    The reception staff were always friendly and helpful making calls for us when we asked for their assistance on a couple of occasions and always greeted us with a smile. Our room was on the fourth floor and not facing the road so external noise wasn't a problem for us but the walls were pretty thin and we could hear probably more than we wanted to from our neighbours...  We - a female couple - were given a room with two three-quarter sized beds (very firm beds!) and it had all the usual amenities (for UK based travellers think Travelodge standard - but clean) and a large bathroom flat-screen TV with channels in a variety of languages including English French and German. Eurosport also available. The room was cleaned and made up daily and toiletries replenished and had a small balcony with a table and two chairs outside.    The breakfast - served from 0630-1030 was plentiful and varied - seriously when you hear the words ""continental breakfast"" this isn't what you expect! A variety of cereals pastries croissants bread rolls boiled eggs yogurt hot flat-bread porridge jam cheese cold meat olives dried and fresh fruit nuts and of course orange juice and some seriously good coffee.    There's a swimming pool up on the roof which we didn't use but looked spotlessly clean. All of the communal areas were well tended and all of the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful.    There are a number of places to eat close by that are very reasonably priced and used by locals and tourists alike. The hotel is about a 10 minute drive from the airport and we'd arranged transfers when we booked (see http://www.resorthoppa.com/) for not very much at all.    In a nutshell the hotel is basic but clean and I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.    Just one point: other reviews and travel websites I've read say the hotel has the facility to change currency into Moroccan Dirhams for you - this is not the case any longer so be prepared to find somewhere else to do it!",Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cheadle, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenSurname

Hotel Almas,Elle R wrote a review Mar 2014,50,A positive review on the treatment of foreigners at Morocco airport and holidaying there,This was. Real value for money hotel. It was clean spacious and very comfortable. The staff were very kind Nd helpful. My daughter and I were in a room with 2 double beds the hotel is situated in the heart of real Morocco culture  in terms of people being both well off and poor but very accommodating. There is a fish restaurant next door and nice cheap local cafes and stalls for those who do not mind eating with the locals. I went to Morocco feeling very anxious because of some of the poor reviews written about the treatment of people of colour at the airport. My daughter and I were treated very well at the airport we went through the intensive body search at the airport 'like everyone else' but so what if It ensures safe flight. Marekesh is a place where you can choose to spend time catching up on rest in your hotel and yet have enough to engage in daily activities.

Hotel Almas,Mga1500 wrote a review Mar 2014,30,An Economy hotel,Reasonable location outside of the Medina but close enough to walk in. 20 mins or so. Two very good restaurants near by Rhe Bagatelle - very French and the the hotel de la poste - French comical style and by far the best.  Hotel did not have a hairdryer for us to use after telling us one would be brought to the room. Ro we had was clean and adequate. Main issue is it is quite noisy at night which didn't bother us but could be very annoying. Hotel arranged two trips for us one by 4x4 to the Atlas Mountains which is really worth doing. The other to Essaouira which is definitely worth visiting but don't use the bus service try and get a car or 4x4 - it took us over 3 hours to get there.  Staff were friendly enough and helpful.

Hotel Almas,dilip j wrote a review Mar 2014,40,V Good value for money,A really good place to stay within easy access to all city locations and the airport. We stayed for 5 nights on the third floor. Breakfast is continental but plentiful at all times. Staff are friendly and the receptionist do speak English although French is the most common European lang. My wife being a vegetarian had a problem as we were staying on half board basis but they tried their best. Recommend B&B with lots of choices outside for meals in the evening. Nice area but do haggle with taxis outside as recommended prices from hotel can be a bit high eg 25Dh max to central square in the evening by a taxi outside is ample.  Overall the receptionist and night staff who stand outside were great.  Great location great city and great place to stay.  My only recommend is the silly notice of not taking food inside as they don't sell anything if you are peckish. We will definitely stay at Almas again.,Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Eastleigh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/432dilipj
Hotel Almas,Ali M wrote a review Mar 2014,40,A very enjoyable stay in Feburary,We stayed for 5 nights here and were very pleased with the hotel. We had arranged for transfers with the booking and so had no hassle with taxis to and from the airport.    We had a room at the rear of the hotel on the second floor. The room was a generous size with a king sized plus bed with several pillows. The bedding was clean and fresh. There was a balcony which had two chairs and a table and was in sunshine until about 3pm. The view was not great though...we looked on another hotel/apartment block but we did not feel hemmed in. The bathroom had a double shower large basin and WC. There was plenty of towels and shampoo / shower gel were left daily by the (cleaning) maid.    The breakfast was very tasty and plenty of it! it was served until 10am. You could chose from eggs cereal pancakes cheese and meat fresh and dried fruit bread rolls jams and coffee/tea. The dining room had an outside terrace with additional tables which came in handy when the dining room was busy. Even at 9.45 am there was still plenty of food available.    Downstairs in reception there were a couple of small seating areas but just outside of the main doors was a large outside seating area with wicker chairs and tables.I would imagine it would be cool in the heat of summer.    The roof terrace is a nice escape with impressive views across to the snow topped mountains. We did not use the pool but it looked ok.    We found the staff helpful and friendly.    The hotel is a 20 minute walk to the Medina area and is close to a MacDonalds local restaurants and shops. A taxi in for the return journey (from Medina etc) was 30 DMs.    In summary we would recommend this hotel for a very comfortable and pleasant stay. If we returned in the future we would stay again.,Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sunderland, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alim241
Hotel Almas,ROB T wrote a review Feb 2014,30,GREAT LOCATION,W had one night at the end of a trip from Spain. The hotel is about 500 metres from the Railway Station and it's obvious when you get near to it.  The chap at reception was very helpful and provided us with a map of the town. We stayed on the third floor in a good room. Clean and tidy with a small balcony albeit the view wasn't that special.  The bathroom is clean and we were pleased with the deal.  Breakfast is served on the second floor and had a the usual buffet spread. (Take some PG Tips or similar. The tea in Morocco was not good!)  We walked to the Medina which was about 10-15 minutes away. We had the usual hassle from the locals and I would recommend that anyone pays little attention to the directions they are given there!  We sought a couple of bars out at night; when you exit the hotel turn left and there are three just up the road They are restaurants with bars at the back so are not obvious; the way to note them is they usually have a big guy / doorman sitting on a stool outside  We got a taxi the next day back to the airport. The road has now been improved since I last went and it only took ten minutes to get there.  I would stay at this hotel again.,Date of stay: January 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F11PSY
Hotel Almas,UrsulaRT wrote a review Feb 2014,30,"Nice Location, spacious room, constant interrupted sleep!",Myself and two friends stayed at Hotel Almas for 5 nights 12th Feb - 17th Feb. When getting a taxi from the airport pay 100 Dirham! Maximum 150 Dirham. They may try charging you 200 don't have it! When arriving at the hotel which was about a 15 minutes drive from the airport the porter immediately came to the taxi and grabbed our cases. Check in was efficient and easy and the man at the reception was helpful and friendly.    We stayed in a triple room 1st floor 111 which was very large and spacious with 3 firm beds. I like a firm mattress but if you don't you may find this uncomfortable. Furthermore there was only 1 pillow per bed 1 spare in the cupboard. I normally have about 8 at home so this wasn't great. The room was clean and was cleaned everyday to high standards. The bathroom was spacious large shower no bath which I would of liked...The main problem was the walls were thin you could hear traffic all night and all morning people were moving furniture early hours of the morning and the building next door was having some sort of move around which meant none of us had a good nights sleep not one single night during our stay. After being harassed in the street all day this would have been nice but we made a joke out of it in the end.    We hadn't paid for breakfast as part of our stay but did go down a couple of days to eat. If you get up early 8.30/9.00am you'll get eggs and pancakes and cheese. If you attend 9.45am onwards they'll all be gone with nothing being replaced and staff dawdling. Furthermore the waitress came over to us mid-breakfast whenever we were eating and made us sign the bill as if they thought we might run away and not pay which I found rude and insulting. The coffee and pastries were delicious but if I was paying I would expect more.    The reception staff were fantastic! Their English was good and the gentlemen helped us find places to eat and go in the evenings advised us on prices and ordered us a taxi every time we went out. The lady also helped us by phoning about 4 spa's and booking us in for treatments advising which ones were and weren't good! So thank you!    Make sure you book restaurants if you'll be attending especially ''Comptoir Darna'' ''Bagatelle'' and ''Al Fassia''. Level 5 you wont have to book its dear but delicious. There's a KFC Mcdonalds and other cafe's nearby but that wasn't our cup of tea. There's a Lacoste and a Zara about 5 minutes away but taxes mean they're expensive. The medina is about a 15 minute taxi drive away which will be about 40 dirham.    The pool on the roof was freezing cold but it was quiet up there with beautiful views this was a nice touch.

Great location just a short taxi journey from the airport. And similarly a short taxi journey (or walk if it's a nice day as we did) from jamaa el fna.  We booked a double but were given twin so after the first night we moved which was also better as we were further from the lifts and the restaurant which is pretty noisy on a morning.  The double was only 2 singles pushed together but wasn't too bad.  Rooms very clean and more than adequate. Probably on par with a holiday inn or some similar quality hotel in the uk. Not the best but clean and liveable!  Breakfast was ok but got boring after a couple of days as not much variety.  Supposedly room service but no menus so it's pretty much a game of q&a until you can get food.  No tea or coffee facilities in the room they also have a sign outside saying you can't bring your own food or drink in so you'll need to be discreet when you do so as we did! (They provide you with a fridge so you may as well stock it!!)  Good roof terrace with a nice pool!  Free wifi in all rooms and a tv which had 1 English movie channel which showed some pretty decent movies!  If they sort the room service by providing a menu and put tea/coffee facilities in the room and vary the breakfast....this hotel would be perfect but for the price we paid absolutely worth every penny and would definitely come back!!,Date of stay: January 2014,,"Harrogate, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cheesesofnazareth

Hotel Almas,Timothy G wrote a review Jan 2014,50,A modern,"The Hotel Almas is quick and easy to find (unlike most Riads in Marrakesh) being a modern and well equipped Hotel within a ten minute trolley case stroll of the rather beautiful central station or the same time in a taxi (40 MAD tops) from the Jemaa El Fna.  Situated in the ""new"" part of Marrakesh it is round the corner from the ""Place Novembre 16"" which boasts some great restaurants and lots of places where you can sip coffee watch the people and update facebook all at the same time.  If (like us) you have never been to Marrakesh before then the Hotel Almas reassures you with sliding glass doors into a cool and marbled reception (24 hour). This has a concierge and a porter to take your cases up to the room. The room itself was a pleasant surprise. Ours had air conditioning a balcony for morning coffee free Wi-fi at a good bandwidth (6Mbps) an ENORMOUS bed an ensuite bathroom a large desk by the window with mirror above for making up in the morning and a flat screen TV. It was a nicely ""familiar"" environment from which to venture out and discover the ancient and modern quarters of this vibrant and charming city and the surrounding region.  Hotel Almas is in a pretty unique location: Turn left when you come out of the Hotel and there are street restaurants where you can join the locals as they smoke chat and tolerate the street cats. Here both of you can eat really well and smoke passively for 200 MAD (without alcohol). Turn right and venture towards the plaza and you can be wined and dined at the Cafe de Paris like kings for 850 MAD - thats about 70 euro.  Language wise Hotel Almas is a place where even schoolboy french is readily accepted as a viable form of communication as is the dying art of mime - especially if accompanied by carefully placed sound effects. Having completed a performance on the theme of water quality from the Hotel taps and possible side effects that would have made Lional Blair proud the Moroccan tour guide smiled politely and said in perfect English - ""All of the Water in Marrakesh is good but it has levels of Chlorine that your digestion may not tolerate - it may be best for you to stick to bottled water"".

The hotel is situated in the 'new' part of the town close to shops/bars etc.. You do need a taxi/bus though to travel to the medina/old town.  Facilities in the hotel are basic the bed and pillows were a little too hard for my liking and my room was at the front of the hotel so noise at night was a problem and struggled to get to sleep. Nice TV but unfortunately no English channels although you do get to the odd show/movie shown in English with Arabic subtitles.  The breakfast was very poor the orange juice diluted and clearly targeted to the European market but I suppose that's what you have to expect in a Muslim country - you're not going to get bacon and sausage!! :)  The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful even personally showing me were to by alcohol locally - a general point as this is a Muslim country very few restaurants serve alcohol particularly in and around the medina.,Date of stay: December 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Bury, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bazellis
Hotel Almas,hosam m wrote a review Nov 2013,40,Great location and good value,The best thing I liked was it's location and value you can walk to a good variety of shopsrestaurants and bars.

Hotel Almas,gemma_shrp wrote a review Nov 2013,30,Average hotel in a good location,We stayed 3 nights in the medina and then decided to stay in gueliz for 2 nights to sample the 'new city'. The hotel is in a great location jusy a short 5 mins walk to the shopping centre cafes and bars. The hotel staff were very pleasant. The breakfast was very nice with a large variety of food to choose from. Our room was ok. It was very spacious and bright with a nice balcony. The negatives were that there appeared to be a large gap in one part of the ceiling where you could see into like the loft part of the hotel? At first we thought this was a broken ceiling panel. When checking with the staff and having a look in another room it would appear this is just how it is designed? Maybe? It did not effect our stay but it was unsightly and almost looked like someone could get in if they wanted. We did also see a lot of ants in the bathroom and in the bed. The rooftop swimming pool was very nice clean and relaxing. This is not the worst hotel I have stayed in but I would only describe it as ok.,,,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gemma_shrp
Hotel Almas,simon-fidler wrote a review Nov 2013,30,Let down by its breakfasts and smoking policy,We stayed here twice during the same trip to Morocco and had we not returned I would have rated it more highly particularly for the suite rooms we were given first time round. Internet connection was also good when in certain areas of the hotel and it was free. But on both occasions the breakfast choice was poor and the organisation of it worse. I know breakfast isn't an extensive and wide ranging meal in Morocco but they could have at least made sure what was on offer was replenished regularly and the orange juice not so diluted that it tasted like squash. Our second visit was really disappointing because our son was allocated a room that reeked of smoke and we weren't asked beforehand if we wanted a non-smoking room (if they exist). It was sad that it was let down by poor management as the location is great; being so close to the number 1 bus route that goes to the Medina for 4 dirhams and just round the corner from the excellent Amaia restaurant.,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Southampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simon-fidler
Hotel Almas,Ollossm wrote a review Nov 2013,40,Great base & good value,"The hotel certainly stands out on the street!    We arrived on the 27th Oct and the taxi fare here from the airport was 150dirhams took about 15 mins. It would appear the pricing is set on the airport boards near the taxi rank.    We were signed in quickly and given our key - it is one of the credit card type keys which is great but it also activates the electricity in the room which is not so great if you want to charge items up when you are out as as soon as you remove the card the power goes. A minor hitch though and many hotels are now going down this route.    The reception area was very inviting and the ""lounge"" area outside the main door was very nice and we spent time sat here every night after a last coffee of the day in Winoo (a great juice / coffee bar two doors up).    Staff on reception were very helpful at all times.    We were on the 5th floor and there is fortunately a lift.    The room was large and spotlessly clean as was the bathroom which had a lovely large shower with plentiful hot water although the water pressure did dip a few times.    The bed was lovely and firm and HUGE! I think it was a double and single pushed together. Bedding was lovely and crisp and seemed to be changed daily.    There was a large flatscreen TV in the room which didn't show English channels but the music channel came in handy.    Lighting in the room was a tad dim but not a major hassle.    There is a fridge in the room as well which is big enough to hold a few bottles of water.    Breakfast was a continental type affair and there was always plenty of everything although tea spoons always seemed to be out of stock / all used when we hit the dining room but staff were happy to go and grab some.    The swimming pool on the roof is small very small and we didn't use it but we did spend some time up there taking in the view and just having a relax. Again like the rest of the hotel the pool and surrounding area was very clean.    A taxi to Katoubia Mosque was 25dirhams and to the Tanneries was 35dirham coming back from the square at night was more pricey at 50dirhams but we had been forewarned fares could double as darkness fell.    As mentioned reception staff were very helpful for sourcing cab pricing and they did make a call for us as well.    The hotel is about a 25 to 35 minute walk from the Fna square so not far at all really and a cab was cheap enough anyway.    The only thing I wish they would consider investing in is room safes.    As we went back to the airport in daylight we got a cab for 90 dirhams but you can expect to pay anything from 75 to 100 dirhams.    We stayed 5 nights and the only extra over and above the booked price was a 100dirham tourist tax which we were expecting and were informed about when checking in.    All in all we found the Almas to be in an excellent location to be very clean and with very helpful & friendly staff and would therefore have no problem in recommending this Hotel to others.",Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Brundall, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/homebrew_author

Hotel Almas,sooz322 wrote a review Oct 2013,30,Average hotel at an average price,My partner and I stayed here for one night in October before catching our flight home. The room was large and clean but there were stains on the carpet and ants in the bathroom. The bed was massive and the storage space was generous.  As other reviewers have stated the hotel is in the new town about a 30 minute walk from the main square and near some nice bars / cafes (and McDonalds / KFC if you are so inclined).  The chap on reception was friendly enough with decent English but the lady was somewhat surly.  There was no safe in the room so we asked for use of the safe deposit box which was basically an envelope held under the reception desk.  The only real niggle with the room was the shower whose temperature fluctuated whilst in use and the length of time it took the water to drain away.  We only sat by the pool (which seemed to be used by the pool attendant's family) which is very small but probably quite welcome after a hot day's sightseeing. No signs of life at the poolside bar.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Glasgow,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sooz322

Location for us was perfect close to new shopping area approx 30 mins walk to Jemaa el Fnaa square or 20 dirhams (if your lucky) by taxi. No bar in hotel but Acima large supermarket nearby (approx 10 min) walk has a reasonable selection of wines for apero's.

Hotel Almas,Mr-MrsLondon wrote a review Sep 2013,40,Hotel Almas,We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights in August 2013. The hotel was nice and clean and worth the money we paid. The staff were very nice and helpful and always gave us good advice when we asked about sightseeing and excursions and even provided with a map marked with the tourist hotspots. We booked the Atlas mountain tour through the hotel which was an amazing experience and must see. There was no safety deposit box in the room...however when my husband enquired about it ttwice they brought us up a safe to keep in the room which was very helpful.  The rooftop pool looks very nice and clean...the pool itself was really cold so no one was hardly ever there.    The hotel is a 20-30 min walk from the square. We walked it once and got the horse and carriage ride back which was really nice. After that we went by taxi which was 15-20 dirhams. The square is an experience not to be missed especially at night when it is packed out and bustling with food stalls however we didn't eat there. The souks behind the square are full of beautiful things and good bargains but you have to haggle good and proper in every single shop which can get very tiring towards the end.    Our Overall experience of Marrakech was really good...the morrocons are very kind and helpful people.

Hotel Almas,mmm49 wrote a review Jul 2013,40,Excellent Hotel,We booked 6 days in this hotel as we got a good deal for bed and breakfast wasn't expecting it to be amazing because of what we paid - turned out we couldn't have been more pleased with our stay.    The room was clean and had plenty of space - we were at the front of the hotel which meant we looked out on to the road which could be quite noisy but we're both quite deep sleepers once we were asleep so didn't affect us too much but could imagine it would annoy others.    The pool is on the roof of the hotel which gave nice views over the area and there was a lifeguard on duty most of the time which would reassure parents - its not a huge area so can imagine when the hotel is busy there wouldn't be enough space and sun loungers but we were lucky and always got one. Also the water is cold not heated at all - it is very refreshing after a hot day and once you're in you don't really notice the cold.    The staff at the hotel were really helpful - we had heard from other people that the hotel staff always try and pressure you in to doing day trip the staff here didn't even mention day trips but were more than happy to organise the trips we did go one.    The hotel is in the perfect place - its not right in the busy Medina area which can get quite in your face especially as we were two girls traveling together but it was still in easy walking distance with lots of things on the way to see as well.    A couple of tips when in Marrakesh:    - Nothing is free they will try and give you things saying its free and it is not they will then not leave you alone until you have given them money saw this happening quite a lot to some people or they will try and give you directions and charge you for that.    - If you get lost in the Souks which can happen quite easily as they are maze like - try and tag on to one of the tour groups which are always going around the area as they will lead you back to the exit.    - There is the usual red open top sightseeing bus which goes around the whole area would definitely recommend getting a week ticket for this - it may be a bit more expensive but really is worth it as looking at the local buses they were crammed full and difficult to know where they are going whereas the red bus has a map of the route and they run quite late so good to jump on and off especially at night when we wanted to go places and didn't really want to walk or get a taxi.,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,mmm,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mmm49

Hotel Almas,110paul wrote a review Jun 2013,50,Cheap Midweek trip to marrakech,Excellent air conditioned hotel just off the main route into the centre (50 Dh taxi ride). Large rooms with comfortable beds (we had a triple for just over 130 euros for 2 nights). Simple but filling breakfast with plenty of bread/croissants boiled eggs yoghurt etc. The rooftop pool was a bonus especially when the tmperatures hit 40 degress at about 4pm. Two amazing local resaurants next door. A fish restaurant with a very varied selection of fish can be seen displayed on the ice counter. We had the Royle fish platter but too much to each for lunch but was great should have gone for the 70Dh lobster it looked fab. Our favourite was the small tagine restaurant doing simple but tasty lamb tagines during the day and sizzling meat of choice during the night with plenty of bread to mop up the days drinking. Finding places to drink in marrakech was a challenge even after doing my homework. Got fleeced by friendly local on first afternoon being over kind to show us to a bar going a very convoluted route and then demanding 200Dh (live and learn for next time). Saying that he did get us to a great roof top bar looking back over the Koutoubia Mosque with very arabian nights decor (Restaurant Dar Nejjarine). My suggestion is let the taxi driver get you to the bar and possibly arrange a pickup to you next destination seems to work fine. Wouldnt recommend Cafe Bar de l'escale bar just across the road from the hotel as is just a glorified greasy spoon that serves alcohol. More upmarket is Kechmara in the next street parrallel to l'escale with a very european light modern decor restaurant downstairs (only place we found selling pints of Flag) upstairs is a fantastic chill out rooftop bar with canope shade. Another great roof top bar is Kozybar entered from within the market square (Marche Couvert I think) watch the sun go down and the storks doing what storks do. Its a great location to walk up to the night market following the main road and the hordes of people that come out once the sun goes down. The night market needs to seen to be believed how many people flock round the food stalls and general entertainers (lighting a bit dim further back from the stalls). Lots of bargains to be had in the souks or the shops around the night market.,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Bedford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/110paul

Hotel Almas,CmarieJ wrote a review Jun 2013,50,Fantastic,We stayed here for 3 nights in June. Firstly I might add we are 3 young girls from England and safety was a huge part of choosing this hotel.  We arrived at 11am and the receptionist said the room will be about half an hour but we were welcome to leave our luggage and stay by the pool. We did just that!    The pool is on the roof top accessible by stairs from the 5th floor. It is beautiful its brand new clean open and so inviting. There are about 15 sun loungers and plenty of parasols up there there are also toilets and showers which were kept exceptionally clean. Pool towels are provided. A little warning the pool is not heated its for the brave only.    The rooms- we were on the 4th floor in a triple room. The air con worked perfectly the tv was partially English and the beds were ok. The bathroom was clean and modern the shower has a frosted door so one person could shower and we could still use the bathroom at the same time. Wifi is free in the rooms the minute u step out of the room it's gone. It's doesn't work on the roof or just outside the lobby. There isn't a safe in the room I would Imagine there is a safety box in the lobby but we carried our passports with us.    Breakfast- hmmm basic but its something to start the day off withfresh juice breads eggs and traditional pancake things. Not worth setting an alarm for although it is open till 10.30am.    Location- couldn't fault it. Guilez is the area the international plaza is across the street with zara mango etam and mcdonalds kfc etc. Locally there are lots of restaurants supermarkets shops and banks. We found a great pizza place which charged just £3.50 for a large pizza! We loved strolling around. The medina is a good 30 min walk which is dont recommend in the heatwe caught a petit taxi (yellow fiat puntos) that we paid no more than 30 dirhams (£3) for. Or you could catch a bus......4dirhams.....you can make your own mind up when you see them. We opted for the life endangering thrill ride of a 'no seatbelt or door handled' taxi.  The airport is less than 10mins away you can actually see the planes take off from the pool. We booked return transfers on travel republic for only £7 per person I found this far less stressful than haggling for taxis in an unknown city. Our transfers were comfortable safe minibuses that ran on time.    The medina- keeps your wits about you don't let anyone lead you anywhere they will turn around and ask for money. Keep your bags close to your body and always zipped up. Dont settle for the first price be a bit cheeky and haggle throw in a kiss on the cheek if it gets u a bargain! Often when they don't like your price once you've walked away they'll follow and lower the price. I'd read you should cover both your legs and shoulders I went with just covering shoulders it seems I chose the wrong option cover your legs!    Taxes- when leaving the hotel you are charged 11dirhams per person per night. Save some change for this for us it was 99dirhams so under a tenner.    I would return to this hotel anytime its out of the chaos of the medinaeasy to locate friendly an absolute bargain and has a rooftop pool to lust over.,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Crawley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CmarieJ
Hotel Almas,joooolien wrote a review Jun 2013,40,Good hotel,Based on the tripadvisor reviews we booked this hotel. Really good 3star hotel maybe a little bit more but not 4stars. Clean room and very big bed nice swimming pool (very clean!!) but you miss the small extra’s to make it a 4star place. Welcome was not as we expected based on the review here. Very aloof attitude (is that the right English word?) of the lady in the front desk. Later that day there was a man at the desk I think for the evening shift and he was very welcoming kind and helpful.    At the last day he arranged a taxi for us to pick us up at 6 in the morning for 100 dhr for an early flight. When we left the taxi driver told us it would be 200 dirham and we told him that was not the deal. The kind man wasn’t there but there was another man (security guy?) who helped us with our luggage and he told us ‘’ok pay 150’’. We really wanted to get our flight and were not in the mood for arguing so we agreed. At the airport the taxi driver wanted the money before we left the car we gave him 150 dirham (100 and 50 bill) checked it both and got out of the car to get our bags out of the trunk. He didn’t help us and then showed us a 50 and a 20 bill telling us that we didn’t pay enough! We got angry and were very very very sure of the 50 and 100 bill and that he switched one bill and we told him that. I think he did see on our faces that we were really sure. So he said ‘’ok ok!’’ and drove away.    I know that this not the fault of the hotel but if they arrange a taxi they should really be careful! I do not blame the hotel but I don’t have any good word for the other hotel guy who didn’t help us and told us to pay 150. He even wanted a tip after that (for the suitcases)! I would give this hotel 35 stars but because that isn’t possible I go for 4 stars because of the location breakfast swimming pool and clean rooms. Despite of the stupid taxi driver incident I would definitely stay here again when visiting the Nouvelle Ville area.,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,The Netherlands,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joooolien
Hotel Almas,srj999 wrote a review Jun 2013,40,"Decent hotel, conveniently placed.",We booked this hotel on a half-board basis not knowing what the local food would be like. We neededn't have worried about local cuisine however.    Each receptionist we encountered was polite courteous and helpful. Our room was excellent with an enormous bed. Pillows were a little firm for my other half but I can sleep on a clothes line so had no issues. Great to have AC too as it was generally 33-35 degrees each day outside. No hairdryer but there was a fridge which we kept stocked with diet cokes and bottled water available everywhere. There was a small kiosk just round the corner selling 500ml bottles of water at 15Dh (about £1.50) a time.    We arrived at about 9:30 on our first night and asked if we were too late to eat. The receptionist arranged for a meal to be sent up to our rooms. It was fantastically welcome.    Breakfast was continental buffet. Lots of pastries rolls sliced meats cheese yoghurts. The usual stuff. Coffee (great) tea and fresh orange juice on tap.    Evening meals were limited to say the least. Little choice as there was a small kitchen only open at breakfast and evening meal providing only two choices per night. You'll be disappointed if you don't like chicken and maybe if you do. We ate in the hotel three times but only when we were too tired to go to any of the excellent local cafes or restaurants of which there are loads within 5 minutes walk off Place du 16 Novembre (including MacD if that's your thing). We noticed some people in the lobby with coffees but it wasn't something we actually ordered ourselves.    The swimming pool is on the roof and even when it's hot outside that pool is COLD. It's quite small but made a welcoming if cold break. Towels provided by the pool. Plenty of loungers by the pool plus toilets showers and changing rooms.    Hotel will also provide a few excursions which were paid for on our return to the hotel. We went to see the waterfalls in the Atlas mountains. Not particularly exciting but it was good to get somewhere cooler for the day.    We were on the 2nd floor and had good wifi access. The room overlooked the street but we were not disturbed by any night-time activities despite there being restaurants around us.  Jemaa El Fna is a five minute taxi ride costing around between 30-50Dh (£3-£5) depending on your haggling skills.,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"St Leonards-on-Sea, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/srj999
Hotel Almas,Norfolk_Lady10 wrote a review Jun 2013,40,Great Value & Location,Huge air conditioned rooms very clean and comfortable. Breakfast adequate and great to have the pool which while not huge is extremely clean and most welcome in the heat of the city. Great location adjacent to a Juice and Sandwich bar with the most wonderful fresh fruit juice and fruit salad in one for less than £2. Adjacent to this a great fish restaurant which we were told is the best in Marrakech and where we enjoyed lobster cooked to perfection for £10.00. This area is frequented by the locals so the prices were brilliant but doubled in the next street.    Receptionist's were all very friendly and helpful and their English was also very good.

Friendly staff especially the lifeguard who did a great job of playing with and entertaining our kids!  Breakfast perfectly adequate though imagine if you're staying more than a few nights it could get a little tedious.  Well located as just a 20 minute walk or so down the main street to the Medina and a short taxi ride back if you're too tired to do the return walk.

Hotel Almas,MrWhyte wrote a review May 2013,40,"surprisingly good, real bargain",Excellent hotel for my second stay in Marrakech. Wanted a hotel with a pool didn't want to be right in the hustle and bustle when staying in a Riad in the old quarters and did not want to be far away from all the action.    Hotel Almas ticked all the boxes.    Clean room big bed comfy great shower even a decent movie channel for late night movies before going sleep.    If you are into sunbathing the roof is excellent also where the swimming pool is located.    Staff are friendly and even gave us late check for no extra cost.    Breakfast was fine. Mixture of cold options plus pancakes and boiled eggs.    Great restaurant next door which was always full of locals and food was so cheap yet tasty especially pizza. Also a popular fish place across the road so you will not go hungry.    Superb location if you want to be walking distance from all the action in sqaure or a cheap taxi ride. Gueliz is more of a modern area with excellent restaurants so if you want to stay amongst the history this is not the area for you. The hotel matches the area. Also close to the train and coach station.,Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Essex, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrWhyte

The rooms were spacious and comfortable nice bathroom huge double bed. The staff were very helpful one staff member even walked us down to another hotel to change our sterling into local currency as they can only change euros. Breakfast was good as long as you are not expecting full english this is Morocco after all there was enough to choose from. Also real fresh orange juice not the powdered variety often on offer in many hotels.

I am very well traveled and would normally stay in a 4* hotel so I was very pleased with this 3* hotel. Could not fault it - room and bathroom were very clean and spacious. Breakfast continental which was acceptable. Swimming pool small but adequate and again very clean.    Where the hotel is situated is ideal for restaurants and shops. Next door are some really good and cheap restaurants. There is a fish restaurant we had a lobster for £5.

The hotel staff were friendly helpful and spoke reasonable English although it is very useful to have some knowledge of French if visiting Morocco. The hotel kindly looked after our luggage for 3 days whilst we were on a tour we then subsequently stayed at the hotel for a further 2 nights this time is a spacious double room. The room although not quite as well equipped as the suite (no hair dryer) was perfectly adequate. There was an extensive buffet breakfast laid out each morning however the evening meals offered less choice. As mentioned in previous reviews Internet access was limited we found we only had access in the evenings but this did not pose a problem for us.

The Internet coverage in the room was none and throughout the hotel it was poor to none. If Internet is important then I would suggest staying elsewhere.  If Internet is not important then it is worth some consideration the room and hotel were clean and the air conditioning good.

Hotel Almas,Nabeela P wrote a review Mar 2013,50,Fabulous stay!,4 of us just returned from 5 nights at this fab hotel. Staff extremely helpful friendly and obliging. The hotel clean room clean breakfast plentiful. Breakfast consisted of same things each morning pastries rolls cheese salami olives jam honey cereal yoghurt porridge boiled eggs Moroccan pancake dates prunes orange segments tea coffee orange juice. Staff were very quick to refill anything that was finishing. Sockets are 2 pin so you need to bring adaptors. Wifi in rooms but found it a bit intermittent sometimes taking 15 mins to get internet back. Shampoo bath gel and soap in bathroom but you might want to bring your own No hairdyer in room but Reception can loan you one but they only have the one. We brought our own iron so not sure if they provide one. Loads of local Restaurants around with KFC and McDonalds pizza hut within walking distance. Train Station close too and about 20 mins walk to Jemaa El Fna square. We went by taxi to Ourika (mountains) a very beautiful peaceful place. A meal by the flowing river is a must and go further into the mountains to the waterfalls if you can but you need to take your trainers with you! Try to see a traditional Berber house how Argan oil is made while you're there. You need to haggle for eveything icluding taxis so you need to have an idea of what you should be paying. Also went by taxi to Casablanca but you can go by train too which is more reasonable if there are 2 of you taxi cheaper if more of you so can split the cost. Highly recommend the open top Tour Bus hop on hop off so you can visit all the Tourist attractions along the way. Horse carriage ride was great too. Remember to keep 11 Dhirams pppn to pay for tax when settling final bill at hotel. We found it a fabulous hotel fabulously located and would definitely recommend this! You need to have an open and accepting mind bartering is must but that is part of the fun! Locals are very friendly not aggressive. Go with the flow and you'll have a fab time!

Hotel Almas,SalmaBegum wrote a review Mar 2013,50,Amazing!,Cannot believe this hotel is 3*!! It deserves more stars! Would recommend this hotel to everyone. Me and my friends stayed here for 7 nights in a triple room. The hotel was spotless. The staff spoke little English despite that they were very friendly and well coming. Going to morocco from England the only problem we had was the sockets. The sockets are different to the sockets from England but the hotel gave us 1 adaptor so we were able to charge out phones etc but one adaptor wasn't enough for us. Also we had taken our hair straighteners and hair dryers from England they were very high voltage I'm assuming so every time we plugged them in we would hear electric crackling noise from the sockets. Lots of restaurants on the streets. Would advice people not to go out at night especially if you're girls being smacked on my bum the first day we arrived wasn't very pleasant for me. In general the hotels very good! And be careful of taxes just as we were about to check out we were told we had to pay 11 MAD per person per night which is equivalent to £1 but since it was our last day me and my friends decided to spend all our money so we had no money to pay for the taxes but luckily they had a chip and pin card machine.

From the moment we stepped in we felt so welcome.    I dont understand why this hotel is a 3* hotel as id be more than happy to stay its a 4* if not 5*!    The lobby was beautiful and very clean. Check in was very quick and were shown to our room on the top floor. Room was spotless! Crisp white bedding clean carpet and spotless bathroom with free toiletries.    Heating and air com worked well. Our kids loved the hotel just as much as we did.    20 min walk to the square. We walked some days and got on the horse and carriage the other days. Horse abd carriage should onlu cost about 40 dirhams.    Breakfast was good with lots of variety to choose from. My children loved the yogurts and chocolate croissants. The spiral pastry was delicious!    lovey clean pool which was cleaned every morning. Good view of the atlas mountains from the roof top.    Initially our plan was to stay in almas hotel for 2 nights then in a riad near the sqaure. After our 2 nights we stayed in a lovely riad but after getting lost twice finding our way back from the sqaure to the riad we thought this wasnt for us and moved back to almas hotel for the rest of our nights and it felt like home.

Hotel Almas,Edward C wrote a review Feb 2013,30,comfortable stay,Stayed in this hotel on a half board basis for a week in January. Overall a very good stay.Located in a side street about 1-1.5 miles from Djemma El Fna square a good 25-30 minutes walk which is good for burning off the calories after breakfast every morning.  Booked a double room as a couple but given a twin room otherwise everything is ok. A/C or heating is individually controlled but on a timer system set by hotel.The room is of adequate size bathroom with walk in shower mini fridge lcd tv with 1 english movie channel only thing missing is tea making facility.  As previously mentioned booked on half board basis but regretted that decision. Dinner on first night was buffet style which was as expected but on 2nd and 3rd night you get a menu with a choice of 2 starters and 2 main course and when they arrive its was like kids portion. We gave up and started dinning outside during our remaining stay. The breakfast was of continental style and its the same choices every morning( choices of pastriescheesecold meatboiled eggs moroccan pancakes freshly squeezed orange juicetea and coffee on tap).  Overall I've given 3 out of 5 rating cos of the foodif that was sorted I would definitely give it a 5 but I would still recommend this hotel as all you really want is a place to relax after a tiring day out.Another advantage is the free wifi throughout the hotel as everyone will have a gadget of some sort on social networking.,Date of stay: January 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edwardc934
Hotel Almas,mamelo wrote a review Jan 2013,50,excelent stay,my boyfriend and i staid a couple of days in Marrakesh. We really enjoyed our stay in the Almas Hotel. The staff was friendly the rooms were always clean and the breakfast was good (continental breakfast and some marocain specialities). Another adventage was the heater in the room. In winter the nights can be quite chilly so some people who staid in Riads told us they were a little cold in the night.  The pool on the roof is very clean but definitely to cold to swim during winter. But the view is great and we spent a couple of hours on the terrace just having a sun bath and relaxing.  The hotel is located in the new town. There are some cheap little restaurants around were you can have fresh fish or seafood. The famous Plaza el Fna isn't too far away. We always walked there which was about 20 minutes by foot.  Our room was located to the side of the street. I have to admit that it was a little noisy in the night. It didn't bother us too much because we both sleep very deep and well almost everywhere :) but somebody who is a little more sensitive should maybe organize him/herself a room located to the other side where it is much more quiet.,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Montreal, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mamelo
Hotel Almas,ijhhh wrote a review Jan 2013,50,Top value for money and location,Spent 3 nights here in January which is long enough for Marrakech in my opinion.    Hotel is about 20 min walk from the main square and 10min from railway station. Turn left out of the hotel door and walk to the end of the street  then left again and you cannot miss the railway station. The bus station is 2min further along the road on left side of the railway station entrance.  The railway station entrance is a huge arch and is quite magnificent. There is a large open square in front and you cannot miss it.    We took the bus from Marrakech to Agadir by Suprabus which takes about 3 hours with a 15 min break at a service station halfway. You need to book the tickets at least the day before and you get an allocated seat. When you arrive for the journey you will also need to pay a small fee of 6dh for your case to go in the luggage hold for which you get a receipt to stick on your case. Smaller bags you can take on the bus.    Hotel Almas is a nice modern hotel with excellent clean roomsmini bar(empty) fridgegood powerful showers and wifi throughout. Breakfast was a cold buffet with the usual fare. Boiled eggs were the only hot item but it set us up for the day.    We tried the fish restaurent 2 doors downturn left out of the hotel entrance which had a wide selection of fish on display to choose from. Very good food and budget prices but do expect the same level of refinement which may be more prevalent in the UK.    There are plenty of other Morrocan eateries around this hotel but if you wish to give the local food a miss Macdonalds is literally about 250 yds if you turn right on exit from the hotel.(there is also another McDs adjacent to the railway station.    All the upmarket shops are in the locality 2 mins away again if you turn right and head towards Macdonalds you will come across Zara Mango etc.    The main square is an an amazing place by day and night and you can eat there at the many open stalls. We used the open top touristique bus which is ok for one circuit around the city but buses are not frequent and this service is overpriced and poor value.    Best part of trip was relaxing in the afternoon at the rooftop pool at the hotel which is quite a suntrap!

We had a suite on the 5th floor and it was very spacious and extremely clean and well kept. The staff were all very helpful and even when i had a small accident with the shower door there main concern was for myself and not the door and the whole incident was delt with very professionally and efficiently.  Prehaps if i was being very picky then they need to put some more information about Marrskech and areas of interest in the room having said that you only needed to ask and the information was there.  On a final note I would like to mention the market a few hundred yards from the hotel we found this to be an ideal place for shopping and less daunting and frenetic than the main square and a little gem of a restraunt two streets away from the hotel called the Rotisserie de la Paix which served very good food at very reasonable prices and the service was excellent if you wanted lunch it was served in their courtyard garden which completley shut the outside world out and left you feeling very relaxed,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SimonH692
Hotel Almas,lexragaliauskas wrote a review Dec 2012,50,Comfortable modern hotel in good area,We stayed in the hotel for 8 nights after deciding our pre-booked Riad wasn't for us. We arrived half an hour after booking online and despite being a few hours early for check in the room was ready for us on arrival. The bed was massive a little on the firm side (this seems to be the norm in Marrakech) but very comfortable nonetheless. The room was spacious and clean with a good sized powerful shower in the ensuite bathroom. Big TV with lots of channels and I think 2 channels that were English language one of which seemed to be a movie channel.    We spent quite a lot of time on the roof terrace which was lovely with a great view beautiful to watch the sunset from. The pool was very very cold even when it was quite warm outside (it got up to around 30 degrees Celsius at times) and it was a shame it wasn't heated as it was far too cold to get in but maybe it's better in the summer. The terrace was a nice area to sunbathe on and get a bit of a tan something which we couldn't do whilst out and about as you need to cover up in public.    Breakfast was served between 6 (I think) and 11am so it was nice to be able to get up late and eat breakfast. We took it to our room a couple of times on a tray which wasn't a problem. Breakfast was quite basic but high quality pain au chocolat croissant another sweet pastry good bread butter jam sliced cheeses and ham olives fruity yogurt boiled eggs porridge and pancakes cereal and dried fruit with strong coffee and fresh orange juice on tap.    The staff were very friendly and helpful with the reception staff speaking good English (though it's always courteous to at least try and speak a bit of French!)    The area (Guilez) was nice with a lot of good restaurants and shops nearby very different to the atmosphere in and around the medina and a lot less hassle.    Overall this is a high quality hotel in a good area of Marrakech and very good value for money (we paid 50 euros a night for the room and breakfast for 2).

Hotel Almas,LiamDublinIreland wrote a review Nov 2012,40,Great base for exploring Marrakech!,I stayed in Hotel Almas for 2 nights in early November. I booked it online for €50 a night. Its location was ideal for me as i was arriving from Agadir on the Suprabus comfort (150 Dirhams). Its about a 15 min walk from the bus depot which is near the train station to the hotel. Check in was fast and the lady who spoke English was very friendly and was able to give me help with directions over the few days.  My room on the second floor was nice. It had a massive king size bed which was comfortable. It was clean however the carpet had been stained by red dye. The TV had one english channel. There was no safe in the room only at check in. There was AC in the room and it was adequate for the time of year.  Breakfast was continental and i thought it was very good as continental goes. There was boiled eggs moroccan pancakes some fruit yogurts and a selection of breads pastries cheese and ham. There was also coffee tea juice and water.  I found the location also great because the red bus tour stop no.1 where you could buy a ticket was about a 5 minute walk away. The bus tour for 24hrs was 145 Dirhams. The red bus does two circuits one of the city and the other of the outskirts. You should do both. In the afternoon i used the red bus to make my way closer to the Medina area. Explore around there and Place Jaama El Fna and then i walked back which is a good walk of about 30 minutes. There are plenty taxis also.  After the hustle and bustle of the old city it was nice to return to the quieter area of the Gueliz and hop into the cold rooftop pool to wind down. The Gueliz area is trendy and has plenty shops cafes and restaurants. There is no beer served in the hotel but there is a small Moroccan bar across the road.,Date of stay: November 2012,Trip type: Traveled solo,Dublin Ireland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LiamDublinIreland

Although the hotel is situated in Gueliz it has many good restaurants nearby and is close to up-market shops. It is easy to get a taxi to the medina but bargain if the price asked is unrealistic!,Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled solo,CUMBRIA ENGLAND,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susansusanr
Hotel Almas,PhilSwan wrote a review Sep 2012,50,"Great place, central to everything and a pool on the roof!!!",The place was great. Staff go out of their way to help you and can't do enough for you. It's kept spotless all day and is quiet at night. Ideal place to stay as it is 5 mins walk from city centre and about 5 mins in taxi to medina and souks. Food was great as well we had half board and whether we had the meal for dinner time or lunch they served a three course meal. Highly recommended!!,Date of stay: September 2012,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhilSwan

Hotel Almas,shoes4 wrote a review Feb 2012,50,Great Hotel,Stayed for 3 nights - cost 50dh (£5) for the 10min taxi from the airport.  Very large clean rooms -fridge as well with a supermarket 5min walk was handy for cold drinks. breakfast was good to start the day.  Staff were v friendly and helpful - we had a reservation at a restaurant and they flagged down and checked with the taxi driver that he knew where we were going so we got there in good time.  Would recommend for all types of travellers we are in our 20's but there were older and families staying here too.  Love Marrakech and after a hetic time seeing the sights- this hotel was a pleasure to come back to relax ready for the next day.,Date of stay: February 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Yeovil, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shoes4
Hotel Almas,WILLIAM R wrote a review Feb 2012,40,Very helpful staff and a clean hotel,My wife and son accompanied me at this hotel and it was a pleasant experience. Unlike the 2 hotels we stayed at in Beni Mellal namely The Beni Day Inn and the Hotel Dar Assalam. Beware of the staff sitting beside the reception in the Beni Day and the prices charged at the Dar Assalam are not the price quoted when you book in We will not be caught again there I assure you,Date of stay: January 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/526WILLIAMR

Hotel Almas,missyperu wrote a review Oct 2011,50,Excellent quality hotel,"We arrived in Marrekesh and stayed at a riad first and very disappointed with the start of our trip. The riad looked niceon first appearances but nothing worked properly especially the plumbing so we left after 2 days and found this wonderful clean new beautifully furnished hotel. The room was quite large with a large terrace . We had the biggest king bed ever with luxurious linen a fridge and english channels on the TV and to top it off ""Free WIFI "" in our room. The staff were very friendly and helpful. All up a fabulous 3 days in this hotel and we got a fantastic price for this room.",Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,queensland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/missyperu
Hotel Almas,TinoA wrote a review Sep 2011,40,"Quiet hotel, neat accomodation",This is a new hotel located on a quiet street in an otherwise noisy city. A friend and I stayed there in single rooms for 2 nights preceeding and following a hiking trip up mount Toubkal. The rooms were clean comfortable and well equipped with AC fridge and LCD TV. The bathroom was a bit small but adequate. The staff at reception were helpful and pleasant when approached. Choice at breakfast was a little scarce with only a few buns croissants one type of cheese yougurt and some kind of ham and jam. In all the hotel provides good value for money.,Date of stay: August 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Nairobi, Kenya",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TinoA
