Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,fbusa wrote a review Jan 2023,50,Great hotel with wonderful staff,Beautiful architecture interior design and landscaping. The staff are wonderful - very professional and helpful yet friendly and always smiling. We stayed for 7 nights and hope to return. The golf course which we played 3 times and the practice facilities were well maintained and very scenic and a great golf club for post round beers! We enjoyed all the restaurants with the live music and the cocktail bar with their Dj. Because it was January it was lovely to have real fires lit in the evenings - very cosy.  The food from breakfast to evening meals was excellent. The only thing I'd change would be to be able to sit in the Mexican restaurant Domo in the evening for a change of ambience;( because the hotel was quieter in January the Mexican menu and International menu were both available but in the International restaurant only). Highly recommend the Moroccan restaurant upstairs which is beautiful and has a real fire - we ate there 3 times.  This hotel ticked all the boxes for us - lovely food service and ambience. We hope to return.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fbusa
Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Meander00164264540 wrote a review Mar 23,50,Fantastic hotel with outstanding service,We had a fantastic time and would certainly return    Everyone is friendly and welcoming  All the restaurants serve fantastic meals  We especially enjoyed Al Ain as this serves authentic Moroccan meals  We were well looked over during our stay by Marouane    The breakfast buffet is extraordinary a fantastic variety to choose from  With our waiter's Mohamed and Abdullah being especially warm and welcoming  The Spa and sport's center are fantastic additions to the hotel both are quiet places to relax  I highly recommend a treatment at the spa  Ours was extremely relaxing  We are non golfers so locating La Sabra could have been a challenge but Marouane arranged a buggy to take us there  (La Sabra is at the golf course clubhouse but there is no signage showing the way)  Not a major issue and didn't detract from our stay  But when you're tired from a long trip be aware that check in is 4pm not 2pm as on UK websites  We found this out later  It would have been an advantage if on arrival we were told when the room would be ready as thinking it would be ready at 2pm was a little confusing in hind sight we should have gone for a meal while we waited,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meander00164264540
Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,carolineandmartin wrote a review Mar 17,50,Superb!,The hotel is stunning with amazing views and beautifully landscaped. Facilities are excellent and all the staff are super friendly.  The spa is lovely and tranquil and the deep tissue massage from Ikbal the therapist was easily one of the best massages ever!  All the food was spot on and words cannot describe just how good the sushi at Le Bar is.  The pool is one of the largest we’ve ever seen heated to a perfect temperature and the poolside staff were so helpful and attentive especially Abderazzak who looked after us every day.

Rachid the Breakfast manager was extraordinarily helpful making sure we were well taken care of every morning. Hdmza/Hamza at the mexican restaurant was wonderful and took great care of us.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Benjamin O wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Absolutely Magnificent,First time visiting Morocco and Marrakech and what an incredible place to stay. 8 nights in one of the Presidential Suites impeccable hugely spacious and perfect for a family.    Beautifully finished architecture decor and materials- luxury but with an authentic character. Top-notch bedding and suite amenities. The main hotel buildings reflect this- beautiful ornate but warm and welcoming.    Setting is stunning- a palm-fringed oasis with beautiful pools and amazing views out to the High Atlas Mountains.    Food was fantastic great diverse breakfast offering and a range of restaurants- Al Aïn the traditional Moroccan restaurant was a highlight.    Truly what sets the place apart are the Staff. A genuine and heartfelt welcome from everyone- from the Gardeners to the GM.    Particular mention to Marouane who looked after us throughout- always available via WhatsApp to arrange reservations and coordinate things. Also to Mourad who manages Domo the Mexican restaurant (the Lamb Tacos are a must try!)    Finally to Abderazzak who looked after us at the pool- a wonderful staff member who was brilliant with the kids.    Highly recommend this magical place.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Amersham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JerichoFeaster

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Jenny wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Pretty awesome for all the family.,The staff here are so lovely and accommodating our little daughter was poorly during our holiday and they went out of their way to cheer her up. They indulged my terrible French and were attentive without being intrusive.  The kids pool is perfect! Warm and shallow and allowed us to relax whilst watching our little ones swim and splash around.  A special thank you to Abderazzak who was super friendly and attentive.  Our suite was wonderful and spacious and the hot tub was a bonus for us and the kids- especially in the chilly evenings.  The food was delicious- breakfast a treat and we loved the Moroccan section; there was so much on offer. We ate at all 4 restaurants and the food was delicious and varied at all four.  My only critique would be the in room dining menu could have more fish and vegetarian options.  Overall a fabulous stay and I’m sure we will return.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Amersham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trek47486884439

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,PierLuigi wrote a review Jan 2023,10,Difficult to come back again.,We've went right before pandemic and had a great experience for half of the price this year again we had a problems on invoicing on the last day of departure the ticket system is quite bad..... We were almost charged for the NYE that was paid to the agency (18000Dhm) almost charged by other guest that place our room on the ticket (6500Dhm) but not our signature and name so was not checked by the accounting or reception team. We had a ticket of other room (322) into our invoicing etc..... Same problems at last time same quality but double price. On the good part of the stay service quality of the staff is great they were so kind as always. Staff is great. We had a housekeeping situation. We had the room made on 30th or 31st at 1630hrs after three calls to make it at 1200/1400/1530hrs.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,golffan1963 wrote a review Dec 2022,50,Overwhelming hospitality,The Hotel is located in the mids of a groomed wide palm garden and with own 18 holes golf course. The Junior Suites are very large with all comfort. The hotel is only 20 Minutes from the airport but no noise from airplanes.  The whole stuff represents the overwhelming hospitaliy of the hotel. They read you all desires from the lips and make your stay as comfortable as possible. Especially to mention HASSAN and his colleagues from the breakfast service as well as FAISAL from the Al AÏN Restaurant. This restaurant in the traditional marrocan style and food offering became our favorite.  With half board booked you can go to all restaurants and choose from the regular menu card. Only drinks have to be payed.    The hotel is an ideal location for golfing. Besides the hotel’s own golf course there are more courses arround that are quickly reached by shuttle service from the hotel. The Royal Palm Course is well groomed with a lot of palms planted. The fairways and greens were in a very good shape even after a long dry period in Marocco.  We stayed 14 Days with the golf packages of 10 greenfees.  The only thing to mention for improvement at the golf reception of the Royal Palm course is the reservation of golf carts. We had booked all greenfees including golf cart. But since they actually give out the carts by first come first serve sometimes no more carts were available at our tee times.    We will come back for sure!,Date of stay: November 2022,,"Arni, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/golffan1963
Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Sabs_Reviews wrote a review Nov 2022,50,A hidden Oasis not far from History,Simply a retreat! Stayed three nights at the Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech and it was so peaceful. From the moment I stepped into the foyer of the hotel I was transported to a place of tranquility the view of the landscape and the pool was so tranquil and I just knew that the stay would be special.    The food served is excellent the quality and flavours are just delicious. Everything is so fresh and every meal was just perfect.    The staff are incredibly helpful everyone is so hospitable and welcoming nothing was ever too much or difficult for anyone and my requests were fulfilled promptly.    The jewel in the crown is the landscape what I loved the most was walking between the olive trees to reach either the room or the pool or any other part of the property trees and flowers are everywhere. Even the birds love this property they were everywhere and that added to the charm.    The room was so comfortable stayed in a Junior Suite Garden View room category it was very spacious and comfortable. The back door just opened up to a furnashed terrace looking onto the spectacular landscape and the was a perfect inclusion to the stay.    I can highly recommend the Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech to either families friends or couples it will be perfect for everyone.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Alexandra D wrote a review Nov 2022,50,Loved our stay!,The design and vibe of the place is great. Modern mixed with Moroccan open fires in the evenings and huge pools and grounds. Not the cheapest but definitely an experience.    But if something makes or breaks the place it’s the people. Sufian (our building manager) and his team took great care of us!  If you make it here you also have to drink a cocktail made by Zouhir in the main bar (who will even make cocktails for you that are not on the menu!) and eat some sushi made by Zakaria. Both of them are artists! And they don’t just bring the goodness on the table but also in the soul.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,AMBaldini wrote a review Oct 2022,50,A true oasis,Heavenly. Have been to Marrakech a few times so was happy to be on the outskirts (it takes about 20-30mins to get to the medina in a taxi costing about £20 each way). The setting is beautiful green and open with views of the Atlas Mountains in the distance a real oasis after the intensity of the town centre. Hotel is beautifully laid out swimming pool vast (and warm unusually for pools this size) and interesting for children whilst being gorgeous to look at. Service was excellent  Zakaria and abderrazak looked after us superbly nothing was too much trouble. Also played tennis on the great clay courts and enjoyed our spa massages. Only two bugbears: I felt there could be a greater choice of vegetarian food - there seemed to be more on the children’s menu than there were vegetarian choices on the adults. We also felt slightly duped by the ice cream truck that appeared by the pool to the kids’ delight - there was no indication of cost and it was only on day three when I checked if it was free that it transpired they were 95MAD per cone…. Hotels of this quality are expensive fair enough but slightly disingenuous to not make this clear. Would highly recommend this to families though facilities and space are truly excellent.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AMBaldini

They made the holiday so much better - everyone was very accommodating and friendly but especially Rachid at the bar and Zach at the pool. No request was ever too much and every interaction you had with them they made you feel really special.    We personally would go back just to see Rachid and experience the wonderful level of hospitality that he provided.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Полина wrote a review Oct 2022,50,Golf,One day we decided to try playing golf. In the evening we asked to organize a practice on the next day and the only person that could give us a practice then was the director of the club - Michel.  It was the first time we played golf and our coach was excellent! Michel told us the types of golf-clubs prices. He taught us how to hold a golf-club how to stand and payed attention to all the details. He clearly explained everything in English.  That practice was consistent and we joined the process with pleasure. I don’t think that without such a nice coach we wanted to play golf again!  The coach made us fall in love with golf so we are going to continue the practice in Russia. He is so nice and friendly and even made a video for Instagram for us!,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled on business,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_L6748DJ

Not only is the property absolutely gorgeous but mainly the staff has been exceptional.  Though we can’t deny the pools were amazing it was mainly the smiling faces of among so many others Abderazzak Zakria and Hassan that made a huge difference.  A warm thank you again to Mhamed that checked us in and was extremely professional and helpful and Ali at check out so arranging and effective.  The breakfast was simply the most qualitative one we have ever had. Everything that’s being showcased is absolutely delicious. Thank you again to the entire breakfast team particularly Hassan on our second day but also the entire Olivier team for making us feel so special.  In room dining was equally awesome and the two gentleman that assisted us that night were of great help.  Not to forget a big thank you for housekeeping for their hard work and for preparing such a lovely room for us.  Lastly we would like to address a special note to Ouaimia. We have had the pleasure to spend a few times with her and she was an absolute blessing. Always smiling anticipating all our needs and of great conversation.

We had a late flight on checkout day and although we had to checkout at 12 we were given the complementary use of a room until 5pm.  The only negative was that a couple of the restaurants were closed meaning the choice for dinner was a little limited however they were very accommodating with whatever we wanted for the children.

He was so attentive and kind and such a hard worker! Oumaima from guest relations was beyond sweet. Her smile was infectious and we want to thank her for making us smile more and welcoming us to the Fairmont.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,WorldTrippingAway wrote a review Aug 2022,50,Excellent stay,The stay was excellent. Summary below:  - Smooth check in that acknowledged my ALL status.  - well sized room with good amenities and furniture.  - Excellent pool service. We were served most of the days by Zakaria who did his best to satisfy all our needs including ordering custom made baby soup for my daughter who was prepared by Chef Hamza. Zakaria was also checking on us regularly to see if anything was required.  - Housekeeping was excellent. Room was made 2 times a day and the staff did all in all an excellent job. They were professional reactive and walked the extra mile everytime.  - Restaurants: probably a bit of disappointment here. Only 2 restaurants plus sushi at the bar as options to eat in the evening. The service was just okay and the price/quality ratio was not interesting considering other options in other 5* resorts nearby or in Marrakech center.  - Breakfast bufet: good quality and numerous choices.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Gemma N wrote a review Aug 2022,50,"Beautiful hotel, great views, great staff",Came for 10 days and have had a wonderful time. Firstly we were concerned about the temperature here in August but it's actually not as bad as what we'd been told - was mid-late 20s in the morning early 30s in the afternoon and hit a high about 3pm....by which time we decided to hit the well equipped gym or have a game of squash before pre-dinner drinks. Around the pool the staff were very attentive - big shout out to Ismael who looked after us wonderfully (along with the other staff) - and the pool itself was fantastic....absolutely huge (maybe 100m long) and perfect for a dip or indeed a proper swim! The hotel is clean well run friendly and much quieter than we anticipated (probably due to the time of year!).  We took a trip to the Atlas Mountains (booked via the hotel) which was a fabulous day out and thoroughly recommended. Marrakech itself is a crazy exciting hot colourful welcoming city which is absolutely worth visiting.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/878gemman
Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,C_J_K wrote a review Aug 2022,50,5 Star in every way!,This was our first visit to Morocco and I can honestly say based on the standards of service amenities and amazing comfort we experienced at The Fairmont Royal Palm we will 110% return.    From the seemless and super professional check-in we experienced on arrival followed by every staff members attention to detail (they all really care so much) we really can’t say a negative comment; and we are very seasoned travellers!    Moulay Driss (the Concierge) has every detail covered if you are looking to book excursions or simply assist with your own pre-booked plans. He called ahead to most of the restaurants we visited to ensure we received a special welcome. Moulay is worth his weight in gold - the Fairmont is lucky to have him.    Our days were spent relaxing by the pool and we wanted for nothing! After the superb service and treatment while having our breakfast (shout out to the really helpful and friendly Assia) we were then looked after amazingly each day by Zakaria and Abderrazak. These guys must walk 20000 steps a day in their quest to make sure you have all you need!    Finally we have to share that the rooms are really comfortable and luxurious we had a Deluxe Garden View Suite which gave us a great opportunity to leave from the patio of our own room and walk through the gardens to the pool.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Sandy K wrote a review Jul 2022,50,Prince villa,The Hotel is a beautiful resort set in acres of land an unexpected oasis.  We stayed at the Prince Villa and we were blown away by the beauty of the Villa- 7 showers our own private pool and garden. It was perfect and the most relaxing holiday I have had.  We had a complimentary bottle of Moët on arrival with an abundance of fruit and nuts. The fridge had water and this was replenished daily. In the evening our beds were turned down and more bedside water provided.  Moroccan tea was delivered to our Villa each afternoon. A lovely touch.  Achraf and Sonae were our housekeepers and they gave us a better sound system balls and inflatables for the pool. They were amazing and made our stay memorable.    Miri our butler was attentive and respectful all our requests for help and advice were fulfilled to the highest standard. He was well informed and saw to every needs. We had our very own ‘Ask Miri!’  Breakfast was well stocked and eggs made to order.  All the staff were respectful and happy to help.  The Fairmont is out of the main district and although there are daily shuttles to the old and new Medina we did end up spending a lot of money on taxis when going out to eat in the evening. The hotel taxis are very expensive - £80 return trip! We did find a great taxi driver on the last day who organises exercising and trips and we would recommend him and his brother- the only downside was that he supports Barcelona FC! His name is Hassine Abdou. He can be hired for the day or the evening. We booked him for the evening and it cost £30 return he waited until we had finished our meal and came to pick us. He also sorts airport transfers. I would use him again.  The hotel restaurant was very quiet and expensive- some items were not in the menu and this was disappointing. We had to return the food as it wasn’t hot enough and I think it was just put in the microwave to heat again- we weren’t offered a discount or a complimentary drink which was disappointing considering the amount of money we spent. The waiters were as helpful as they could be especially as half the items weren’t available. I think this is an area that needs more attention because the rest of the hotel is absolutely amazing.  A visit to the gym is a must as it has its own pool too we wish we had time to play tennis on the courts but we were relaxing too much!  We will return to do more sightseeing as this was a holiday to relax and chill around our own private pool.,Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Lincoln, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandyk218

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,NYNOLON wrote a review Jun 2022,50,A brilliant family stay,"Thank you Fairmont for a spectacular holiday.    We stayed in the wonderful Prince Villa which was extremely spacious (love the ceiling heights!) and very well designed. There are some signs of wear and tear but somehow it didn't detract from the hotel's charm. The grounds around the resort were well maintained (gardeners working non-stop!) and the flowers were in full bloom. You can see the mountains in the distance whilst eating al fresco. They didn't pump any awful lounge music by the pool so you could actually get lost in your own thoughts. Gorgeous.    Service was occasionally patchy (language issues peak season etc.) but the friendliness and boundless enthusiasm from everyone on site more than made up for this. It is abundantly clear the staff genuinely want to help you enjoy your stay they aren't asking ""can I help you?"" just to be polite.    We were assigned a lovely butler named Souad who went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed. She was friendly enthusiastic and frequently treated us to fruit and baked goods. Thoughtful touches were the order of the day all around--- even housekeeping brought pool floats around for the kids to use.    No review would be adequate without mentioning the concierge. Another lovely woman named Souad (not the same as our butler) helped us organise our meal reservations our trip to the souk a trip into the Atlas Mountains and some quad biking. She was an absolute legend---she was both responsive and knowledgeable and pitched the activities just right. Everything she organised was seamless.    The breakfast buffet was great. Our massages were great. The live music in the Moroccan restaurant was great. We all headed home with the most wonderful family memories.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,ATLdud wrote a review Jun 2022,50,Older property with AMAZING staff,Let’s get the negatives out of the way: It becomes evident fairly quickly that the hotel has been around some time. Some furniture is a bit worn. Some of the interior has seen better days. But nothing dramatic it’s just noticeable if you have eyes for details. Prices are on the high side.    I’d nevertheless recommend this hotel in a heartbeat to anybody looking for a luxury secluded retreat outside of Marrakesh.    Here’s why: The staff and service makes all the difference. They truly strive to make your experience great help in any way possible and are most friendly and professional at all times.    The food at the Moroccan Restaurant was outstanding.    The views from the room the restaurant and by the vast pools are gorgeous.. Landscaping around the facilities is impeccable.    Breakfast was outstanding.    Spa and spa treatments were amazing.

Pros:  Exceptional service and the 24hr WhatsApp concierge was really the height of convenience.  Beautiful property - I don’t think I’ve ever said that about a relatively modern hotel construction but this was spectacular.  Very friendly and easy for the kids but without turning in to a hectic family only resort. A couple without kids would have just an enjoyable stay.  Peaceful and calm incredible scent of neroli throughout and no crass music being pumped through speakers…  Our suite was expansive really interesting and actually quite beautiful.  The staff were amazing. We actually had a small car accident and they handled everything for us staying on the phone to translate and sending a car to bring my wife and kids home while I dealt with the insurance company.    One of the most sophisticated hotels I’ve stayed in.    Cons:  The food unfortunately was bland. It wasn’t bad food just completely uninspiring.  You pay for quality in terms of accommodation and that’s fair but the food was also expensive for nothing special.  It’s not a place you can just walk out of to explore marrakech but in fairness they don’t claim to be so this isn’t really a big con just a point worth noting.

The room was beautiful with the comfiest bed the pool and pool area with the Atlas mountain backdrop were stunning. The staff couldn’t have been more helpful and kind special mention to Khalid who was so sweet with our little boy at breakfast even taking him out to feed the birds and Hassan who let him drive the golf buggy it was definitely a highlight for our two year old!    The only slight negative is that the restaurants don’t open until 7pm in the evening so it was tricky with a young child.    We made use of the complimentary shuttle into the city and visited a couple of times which was great to see and it made it super easy.

Due to Covid-19 restrictions there was no buffet at breakfast however any request was catered too kindly. The quality and variety of the food was unparalleled along with service from staff. Meryem the manager of Le’Oliver went out of her way to bring a smile to our faces. The food was lovely especially the chocolate ice cream (it’s a must try!). Mohammad Himdi truly made us feel at home and was a pleasure to chat to everyday!    The spa didn’t disappoint. I made reservations prior to our arrival and Soukaina was very accommodating. Rika is a special lady with a very big heart. The treatments themselves were exactly what was needed and would highly recommend a treatment during your stay.    The staff in general are faultless.

The spa with the indoor pool is just incredible and the fitness so compliant with a resort type. Finally the food is delicious.

I initially thought that we were having a small stay-cation but was completely blown away by what had actually been organised. This hotel was absolutely beautiful and the staff were beyond friendly and helpful! The facilities provided were superb and we felt very well looked after. Especially by the staff member Souad who did her best to deal with our requests and made the stay very pleasurable. It truly felt like a paradise and was most likely the best hotel we have stayed in. A lot of happy memories were made and the whole stay was just so relaxing. Even thinking about it now is making me wish i was back there just chilling by the pool.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,michael n wrote a review Mar 2020,40,Excellent short break…… however lots of toddlers.,We stayed for 5 nights at the beginning of March in a deluxe suite. The room was good a separate sitting room clean very nice sunny terrace with lounges on one terrace and dining table on other views over the garden and mountains. All as described on the website. A slight disconnect between room service and HK. Room service items stayed around for days not cleared by HK. Not sure how that works.  All the staff without exception were very friendly and eager to please. There was plenty of space around the pool area lots of loungers and umbrellas. We ate in all of the outlet’s food generally very good and service excellent all but a little expensive adding on tax and service each time. Especially the wine all the cheaper options on the list were out of stock in the outlets.  We chose to go out of school holidays this made little difference. There were a lot of children staying I would guess 50 % of all parties had pushchairs and toddlers. Breakfast was a bit of a warzone with the toddler's noise and running around. Breakfast was a disappointment. Pastries and bread were exceptionally good. Cappuccinos were consistently perfect. Cooked options on the buffet were disappointing. However we asked for things to be cooked fresh which they did without hesitation.  With the space available we could move to avoid the noise of the toddlers around the pool. We could go back to our terrace which was quiet. Not sure why the hotel doesn’t have an adult only area by the pool. There is enough space to have a children's area and adult-only area at one end.  The bus was good and we used that and towards the end went out each night to restaurants in town. We found a couple which was great and very good value just a short walk from where the bus stopped.  On balance would we return… possibly + room lovely + service excellent – F&B expensive – lots of toddlers.,Date of stay: March 2020,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M8816QTmichaeln

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Saqib Awan wrote a review Mar 2020,30,Distinctly average I'm afraid.,"So the Fairmont. A name synonymous with luxury class and good service all around. As someone that has frequented many Fairmonts around the world I was expecting the very best from this stay - and hey at this price point for Marrakech one would expect top notch comforts. The hotel itself is nestled a cool 25 mins away from the airport and around 30-40mins from Old town. There's a shuttle bus that departs every few hours to take pre-booked guests to the new town and old town centres. But. It's a resort. The idea being that you don't really need to leave this place. But you kind of...do.    Sure there's a golf course. Sure there's a big pool area. Sure there's 2 restaurants. But it's not enough. You find yourself quickly tiring of the limited menu options at breakfast and dinner (the menu stays the same for the duration of the stay) and the option of a buffet to try and spice things up gets pretty old pretty fast when there are about 3 main dishes in total (not counting salads and rices etc...).    Then there's the service. Oh the service. Well it's not Fairmont standard I can tell you that. Every issue I faced was in truth resolved but they arose nonetheless. From the very get go when we arrived we had what can only be described as a comical check-in where the reception staff battled with the concept of a pre-paid room. We went from being told ""you have only paid for one room for one night"" to ""actually no you've paid for everything and this is for the extras that you might need"". As we were told to sit at the bar and wait to sort out the kerfuffle of the check-in bar staff greeted us with cold and surprisingly calculated welcomes. It's almost like they knew not to waste time on us so would constantly remind us that we need to pay for any drinks we want and wouldn't even show the menu to us until we had triple confirmed we were in fact aware of how the concept of a bar worked. But there were some real gems also. In the restaurants there were some really wonderful team members that went above and beyond the call of duty to cater to our little family.    What else...there's a farm a spa and some little mini shops. The farm is great for the kids and they can easily drown a couple of hours there. There's a nice kids club that serves up a lovely lunch buffet and snacks with plenty of activities. If your kids don't like playing in new places without you - work on it before going here as parents can't really be in the kids club. The staff at this place were great and the kids all seemed happy especially our little ones.    So as a summary - lovely property big rooms average service mediocre food and not enough to do. Methinks someone in Fairmont needs to take a look at this place...",Date of stay: February 2020,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saqibawan2
Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Marlene693 wrote a review Feb 2020,50,My visit to Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,I have called the hotel on Monday 24th of February to confirm if I could visit the hotel for a personal experience then I was  Informed that yes I could visit.  When I arrived in the hotel At 4:00pm approximately I visited the bar and ordered my beverage then I asked the hosstess in the bar If could make a booking in the all day dining restaurant then she went and checked then came and informed me that the restaurant is fully booked the same for Italian and Moroccan restaurant.  She told all the outlets are reserved.  Then I had Suchi menu in the bar.  After that I went my self with the bartender to check with the manager of Moroccan restaurant if she had tables availble in the Moroccan restaurant and she said Yes she has table for me.  I could see my self tables available by 6:30 pm. I am not sure why I have two different answers from the staff?  I thought I needed to report this to the management of the hotel on TripAdvisor.  Otherwise the hotel is beautiful and the landscape is magnificent.  I am happy to share my personal visit with the hotel management and hope it would help to improve guests experiences as I know Fairmont is famous for great guests experience.  In general the staff are friendly but I feel that they need to engage more and focus on guests satisfaction.Yes training is required but I felt that more supervisory was required because I saw guests coming to the main bar and asking for orders rather than their order been taken at the table.  I have more details to share and happy to do so.  Overall I highly recommend this beautiful hotel for the products it offer and the beautiful location.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,PierreH1234 wrote a review Feb 2020,50,Fairmont Royal Palm - Highly recommended,We’ve decided spontaneously to travel to Marrakech for a Golf and Sun short trip for a week in the beginning of February. We got very lucky with the weather because the temperature rised daily up to 27°C (80°F).  From the beginning on we were greeted by a very friendly smiling carrying staff whom is always willing to help and tries to guess your needs. In a very short time the service staff started anticipating my usual breakfast orders or which table with which wine we preferred.  Our daily routine and meeting point was the beautiful Lunch restaurant at the pool called L'Olivier where the lovely Mrs. Nadia greeted us with the biggest smile of all. Thanks to her and her service staff we always felt extremely welcomed as if we were on our own terrace.  The view from the restaurant over the pool and the golf course in the background is just amazing. The menu is very appealing and the food quality on high standards. The Menu offers a dish for everyone. From the Royal Palm Burger to the Seabream filet with sweetpotatoe mash all dishes are very tasty.  I have been at the pool every day and I was happy to be served by Mr. Zakaria who stepped around the corner every time I’ve looked up to order something. Very friendly and quick service.  The Moroccan Restaurant and the International Restaurant Le Caravane are excellent and therefor it is highly recommended to stay at the hotel and enjoy the culinary trip.  The Valet staff is always on call quick and very friendly to drive you through the resort where and whenever you want to go.    The Reception staff is slightly to stiff and should get some of the positive energy of their colleagues throughout the outlets since the first impression takes place at the check in. Generally when passing by the front desk smiles are to rare for my taste.    Overall I highly recommend the Hotel and I’m eager to travel again to the Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech.,Date of stay: February 2020,,"Munich, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PierreH1234

Brilliant staff a culture of caring and wanting to help and all in the most amazing environment/ stunning setting.    My two year old daughter was treated like a princess given balloons and treats every day. My wife and I loved the spacious property lavish meals (especially the breakfasts) expansive rooms and wonderful service.    This is a very different property to when we visited two years ago. The money had gone into the infrastructure and amazing decor but the staff really weren’t up to the task there was a culture of saying no to requests the WiFi didn’t work power cuts kept happening and the meals were pretty awful. All of that now a distant memory.    On room choice the deluxe suite was incredible for us. The huge lounge turned into a playroom and the bedroom stayed kids free. The cot even went in one part of the expansive walk in closet without feeling remotely like it was too contained or stuffy to put there. The lawn and outdoor area on the ground floor was brilliant too.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Jen T wrote a review Jan 2020,50,Already planning our return,While our entire stay was wonderful there were a few exceptional employees who went *far* beyond general service levels and should be recognized for being a major reason we are already planning a return trip.    Hafida in the spa was perfect. My hammam treatment was fantastic and her warmth made me feel at home. I have visited spas all over the world and she is among the very best of all practitioners. I have heard that Hammam treatments can be a bit “much” for newbies but Hafida explained everything and I was comfortable the entire time.    Rachid Chibani at L’Olivier was so wonderfully accommodating. He is attentive makes excellent recommendations and also made us feel exceedingly welcome. Hassan was also great. All of the staff are patient with children which made meals so much more enjoyable.    Fatima welcomed us every day with such warmth checking our enjoyment and helping plan experiences that enhanced our stay. She was so helpful. I felt like I had a personal concierge.8    By the pool I would like to acknowledge two employees who also offered exceptional personalized service - Mohammed and Abdelhafid. Both got to know our family played with our son and anticipated our every need. Their service did not feel at all compulsory. They met us with the warmth of friends they surprised our son with pick-up football games and always made a premium spot for us to sit and enjoy. It would have met our expectations to greet us politely and show us to a nice spot. Their service was so much more.    Our room attendants in Residence A Rachid and Darif conscientiously worked to make our stay effortless and special. They decorated our room both for our arrival wishing me a happy birthday and during the week as a special treat. They accommodated all of our requests promptly.    Prior to our arrival Khalid from the Concierge team was extremely helpful arranging our airport transfers as well as a private tour of the Medina with Youssef (who was a great guide!). He had also arranged for us an excursion to a Berber village in the Atlas Mountains but since we were only in Marrakech for 5 days and hadn’t realized just how much the resort had to offer we opted to stay onsite instead.    Finally I must acknowledge the exceptional experience we had at our private cooking class and tour of the farm organized for us by Fatima. Chef Hamza from the Al Ain restaurant was brilliant and charming. Mohammed gave us a really lovely tour entertaining our 5 year-old son throughout and engaging in great conversation with my husband and I as well as translating kitchen tips from Chef Hamza throughout our class. Our attendant was also fantastic. I am sad to have misplaced his name it is not because his service was any less notable. This was an experience we will cherish for years.    There were so many more employees who greeted us warmly every day and created an environment to which we cannot wait to return. The resort is an ideal choice for families for couples and for groups; really for anyone looking for an idyllic retreat near a dynamic city with so much to offer.,Date of stay: December 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jent1227

The property is absolutely gorgeous and has every amenity you could wish for. Our fitness enthusiast teens loved the squash court and the erg rowing machine in the gyms. My husband loved the golf and I was a huge fan of the beautiful pools and walking trails. The breakfast buffet was extensive and everything we ate and drank on-property was delicious. But the real star of the hotel is the staff. They are friendly professional and attentive. Mhmed greeted us at the front desk upon check-in and every time we passed through the lobby for the rest of our stay he made sure to say hello to us by name. At the end of our stay we left something in the room after check-out. He personally drove us back to the room to get our missing belongings. (The property is large and golf carts are used routinely around the grounds). On my first morning I ordered decaf coffee. Soltane was our waiter that morning. On each successive day he remembered my preference and prepared me the coffee even before I could ask for it. At the outdoor patio bar Ilhame was our waitress. She served with a beautiful smile and engaged our whole family. By the end of the trip we found ourselves so attached to her that she even offered to invite us to her upcoming wedding. Another day we chose to have lunch by the pool. Instead of just bringing the food on to-go trays and resting them on the small tables between the lounge chairs the staff brought over a full-size table and chairs and made a special place for us to have lunch. Over and over again we found unique and personal touches at the hotel. We were sad when our stay was over and we will definitely book there again when we return next to Marrakech.,Date of stay: December 2019,,"Denver, Colorado",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeatherS130

Nothing to compare in the area but lack of choices for lunch and dinner is big. Only 2 restaurants with almost the same menu every time is a little boring.  Free shuttle bus was good to go out and have something different in the city. But with restricted time table it wasn’t straightforward to go and back fast. Especially coming back from new town would take 1 hour ( shuttle goes to old town first stays there for 15 minutes for other passengers and half an hour to come to the hotel).  -kid’s club and it’s staffs were great.  -Tried golf course for kid and not recommended  However kid’s tennis camp was better.  -tried Hammam which was a new experience in Marrakech but nothing special.  -room service was different time to time once we got the best penne carbonara in town but second time carbonara was so dried and tasteless!  -Ayoub in breakfast room is a gem.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,westlee71 wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Super friendly service in world class resort with stunning views and fresh mountain air.,We just returned from an amazing stay at this amazing resort. The grounds are huge and beautifully manicured walking amongst the olive trees and looking up at the Atlas mountains and breathing in the fresh air was a wonderful experience.    All of the staff here were of a very high standard but some of them went over and above to ensure we had an amazing pre Christmas break. Special call out firstly to Soltan Boukhtioua in the main restaurant who was super friendly and went out of his way to make sure my wife's gluten free needs were catered for and furthermore spent time with us each day offering tips and advice of where to go and what to see in Marrakech (a future hotel manager in the making for sure).    Secondly Maryam Youaoui in guest services was simply superb in helping arrange my daughters 7th birthday treats my little one had an amazing couple of days being treated like a real princess with endless cakes balloons and singing; all delivered with such warmth and friendliness it it really was of such a high standard and made all of us feel like royalty for a few days; which was down to Maryam and her incredibly high standard of customer care.    And a final special mention to Morad (I hope we got tat right) who organised an amazing in-villa BBQ for us his friendly personality and wonderful sense of humour entertained us the whole evening whilst the delicious food was the equal of anything we have experienced in the world was more than enough to keep our bellies full for days.    Finally special mention to the 2 bedroom villa the place was huge and the garden was so well kept and spacious; you could just stay in the villa and never leave and you'd feel so refreshed and relaxed.    Overall this resort really is special. The location and views are stunning the blue skies and perfect mountain air is something I will always remember. Transfer times from airport is super quick and the fast track immigration is so worthwhile for weary travellers arriving late at night.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Surreypg wrote a review Dec 2019,30,Shame about the noise from the building site,We had a lovely trip. The service was excellent and I cannot fault the staff.    The website mentions building work. What it doesn’t mention is the amount of noise and disruption caused. The pool area is overlooked by the building work and it can’t hardly be called a relaxing environment with drilling workmen shouting to each other and a giant crane moving. The site dominates the entire hotel complex and can be heard from our room. 400 m away from the site.    For a 5 star hotel the menu options especially in the evenings is quite restrictive and stayed the same during our weeks stay. It would make a significant difference if the menus changed and more variety was offered.,Date of stay: November 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Surreypg

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Linda G wrote a review Dec 2019,50,My favorite hotel experience ever,Gorgeous hotel amazing staff and service. We booked a presidential suite and were upgraded to a villa. What a beautiful space. Lots of privacy and comfort. I loved having our own pool. Perfect for people like me who would rather feel at home than be in a crowd. Kamal was our butler. He was very respectful polite and helpful like every other staff member. He was our guy. He made our stay extra special. Anything we needed he was able to help with. He had our breakfast ready every morning at the time we told him to so that we ate as soon as we woke up without leaving our villa. Jetlag made us skip breakfast every day the previous days in Europe so being able to eat at our own table without having to go to the restaurant was amazing. If you ever stay at a villa have them do the night barbecue for you. The set up is gorgeous and the food is delicious. We were 4 only ordered for 2 and ended up with a lot of extra food.  Our villa was cleaned at least 3 times a day. The service is just amazing. We didn't need that much cleaning but it was offered in case we did. We had 4 massages. Omg what a great experience. My husband had Fatima and I had the guy (sorry I forgot his name). Those 90 minutes were heavenly. Sometimes we have massages and the massage therapist just doesn't do a part or a few but this people are the best. We walked out of there feeling new.  The main pool the spa pool and our private pool are gorgeous. We also had a private sauna in our backyard by the pool.  If you like feeling like royalty this is the place.  I went to Tanger Morocco before and was a little afraid of men because of my last visit with only my sister. My daughters and I were extremely happy that men were so respectful and polite at the hotel and in Marrakech overall. My husband did go with me this time but looks like the culture is a lot different than in northern Morroco. I am so pleased with our experience at the hotel that I would definitely recommend and would go back.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Kenzas73 wrote a review Nov 2019,40,Wonderful hotel but restaurants exorbitant,We stayed her for five nights with our children Over half term. The hotel itself is absolutely fabulous: spacious comfortable luxurious bedrooms and bathrooms a fantastic sports centre with squash tennis boxing a gym weights and other facilities. Despite being full the hotel was quiet and did not feel crowded at all. The pools were lovely if very cold and the staff were friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet was fabulous as was the lunch time buffet in the golf club restaurant.    The only reason for not giving this five stars is the exorbitant. I found this prohibitive which meant having to get the shuttle into Marrakesh in the evenings to eat rather than spend around £200 per meal for the family. Whilst the shuttle service is convenient there is no flexibility on the timings and so going out is not as straightforward as it could be. If the price of food in the very good hotel restaurants doesn’t bother you and this is undoubtedly a wonderful hotel. If it does then you then you will either need to stay elsewhere or take the time to plan and pre-book where you want to eat and when and how to get there and back.,Date of stay: November 2019,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kenzas73

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,chocolatechaos wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Only place to stay,We’ve just stayed as a family of 5 (2 kids and mother in law). This ticked every box. The kids club is a god send because it allowed us adults to truly relax in the surroundings and have a drink at the bar or read by the pool which we just can’t do at other hotels. They really dressed the club out in Halloween decor which delighted the children (and me to be honest) and they even had a camel ride on one of the days which was a highlight!    Pool staff were particularly diligent and helpful. Food was great everywhere we ate at the Moroccan restaurant twice as it was such a nice space.    I regularly travel and tend to stay 5 star both for business and for personal travel and this was honestly one of the nicest places I have ever stayed for multiple reasons.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Odette T wrote a review Oct 2019,50,A quiet place of refuge in bustling Marrakech,From the time we arrived at the Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech we experienced what the true meaning of oasis is: calm rejuvenation as well as luxury.  Walking through the olive grove each day from our suite to the breakfast room would put us in just the right mood for the day. But apart from the physical environment the highlight of this experience for us was the warmth and attentiveness of the staff. Even before we set foot in Marrakech the chef concierge Souad went the extra mile to arrange an excellent five-day tour from Casablanca to Marakech. This high level of attentiveness continued all during our stay. Indeed our stay was defined by service that was prompt friendly and personal. For example Soltane and others in the breakfast room remembered our food preferences and welcomed us each day with smiles.

We stayed in one of the Villa Prince with friends. Beautiful interior and outdoor layout with a pool and a Hammam. The staffs kept our Villa clean at all time.  The villa comes with butler service. They were outstanding. They helped us to recover a delayed luggage from the Airport. If you have an event you can count on Abdelilah and Mourad discretion and professionalism. They helped us to organise a memorable birthday at the Villa and a memorable meal at the Moroccan restaurant and specially on a last minute notice they took the initiative (Mourad was off that day and came back specially for us) to organise a surprise for our friend’s wedding anniversary and our friends were full of emotion. The holidays we will never forget.  The breakfast was nice lots of choices and great quality food. One of the staff remember remember how I liked my coffee I’m allergic to milk so that was very good I apologies for not remembering his name another staff member which started a day before our arrival @SoltaneBKH helped me to order a special cake at the last minute I was really please for his quality of service.  We use the semi-olympique pool at the sport facilities which was great.  We enjoyed the food in all restaurants.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Naweed Bukhari wrote a review Sep 2019,40,Excellent hotel,We visited late August/early September just after the busy period.  Firstly this is a truly beautiful hotel inside and out. We had a junior suite and the kids (teens) had a deluxe twin both very spacious and well equipped.The bathrooms have separate bathtub and walk-in shower which is appreciated. Separate dresser area  which is also very practical. We initially had a ground floor room but were kindly moved (without fuss) as there was a very noisy family above us. The 1st/2nd floor rooms are better as you get an enclosed large balcony area with patio furniture and lovely views.  Breakfast was a lovely experience the range of offerings is broad and fresh with great service from the wonderful Adil and colleagues. Chef always smiles and does his best to make your selection. Regarding the rest of the food offerings others have already commented there are issues mainly the limited menus and options - everything is unnecessarily expensive on the a la carte menus so guests (with kids mainly) end up taking the shuttle bus to Marrakesh (new and old town) for their lunch and/or evening meal as it’s so much better value - this is more of a problem if you’re staying for a longer period versus a long weekend - it compresses your time at the wonderful hotel.  It would be solved by having a buffet option in the evenings such as in the Jumeirah Group hotels half-board would then work well. The hotel managers such as the excellent Sofia are keen to hear this feedback and of course it’s early days for this Fairmont property.  The food quality itself is very good no problems with illness.  We attended the Spa every day what an amazing relaxing place ! Lots of privacy quiet nice pool attended by Fatima and colleaguesmany thanks to them.  One thing that stands out in this place compared to other top hotels is just how happy the staff are I mean they are genuinely happy to be there and have impeccable manners considerate and helpful. Nothing is too much trouble they are a real credit to Fairmont Marrakech!  Fitness rooms are also quite good ping pong table is fun and there are plenty of clay tennis courts if you’re interested (better to take your own racquet and balls though).  Overall very happy to recommend this place just needs a few tweaks with the food options.

Only cons but can easily be fixed: a.the breakfast room gets very busy between 09.30-11.00 and all trays get empty you have to wait for 10-15 mins for refills or to find a table. But i must say that the manager was there and tried to solve every problem with a smile which is a very positive sign b. We missed a simple restaurant in the evening to eat with the kids ie. Pizza and pasta. Please please serve simple food at the bar after 18.00!!!  To sum up if you are thea big family opt for the Prince villa you will never regret it.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,nazv13 wrote a review Jul 2019,40,A great holiday but not 100% convinced,I think I’m about to complain on a VERY high level here sorry Fairmont! I’m not even sure what to write as I had a very nice stay with you but in the end was a bit let down.    We had a 2 week family and friends holiday booked at the Fairmont.    The hotel is absolutely gorgeous very spacious rooms bathrooms wardrobe area...just wonderful!    Ever single person who works there is incredibly friendly helpful and always smiling! We were very impressed by the staff and their competence and again friendliness. Most the staff that we were in co tact with knew us by first name and us them.  They would all go out of their way to make sure we were having a memorable stay! Loved it!    A few things that weren’t great... the restaurants at the hotel have good quality food however the kitchen is EXTREMELY slow! Especially when you can see that the hotel is almost empty (max occupancy of 20%) and the restaurants themselves only had us and maybe another 1 table... it used to take them 45min to bring the children’s noodles it gets a bit stressful to wait that long with starving kids.  There was just no such thing as “I’ll just grab a quick lunch”! Each lunch (just a main course or a salad or sandwich) would take 2 hours. With the kids whining that they wanted to head back to the pool! Why is it taking so long etc...    I also want to point out we found the food and drinks very very very overpriced.  The prices were matching the ones of Michelin star restaurants.  Unless you have a half-board or full board package go in to town for your dinners at least.. don’t eat at the hotel every night.  Please don’t misunderstand the dinners in the 2 restaurants are good! Good quality and taste but... the wait is far too long and the prices are too high.  Example from the kids menu...a bowl of spaghetti is 150dhs. A beef carpaccio for lunch is 300dhs. A coke is 60dhs (when they leave you FREE coke and water in your room every day.)  Again I’m used to something else there might be others out there thinking these prices are not high...that’s fine. I gladly pay the high costs for food and drinks...if the rest matches.  For me personally a great holiday is about amazing out of this world food and a very clean 5 star hotel! The Fairmont delivered 1 out of 2.    The was an event/wedding held at the hotel that sort of lasted a few days. We were ok with the noise and the setup of the event but I can imagine it annoyed a few of the other guests.    After the wedding the hotel started some construction work at the pool area (the kids pool area) that was very loud again since we were traveling with kids (and generally speaking kids are loud) the noise didn’t bother us.  The hotel managers did try to approach every guest to apologize for the noise.    All in all we had a really nice 2 week holiday with our friends and family and got to see and experience a lot of new and wonderful things.  Would I recommend the Fairmont Marrakesh...? Maybe...  Would I go back? Not really no.,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Frankfurt, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nazv13

Special mention goes to Hassan for his help during the class and many days thereafter in the restaurant and pool areas.  *You get around the hotel on foot or using buggies. All buggy drivers were kind and v warm - thank you guys.  *Good free regular shuttle service to town- drop off and pick up. Ensure book at least 24 hours beforehand. Can see this being 48 hours as it gets busier!  *Good WiFi - kids were happy!  *Spa seemed excellent but didn't use as cancelled last minute due to awesome afternoon nap :)  *Stayed in presidential suite which was huge - amazing balcony - great place to read have evening drinks or simply nap. 2 rooms separated by living room. Good Jacuzzi and bathroom. Beds exceptionally comfortable.    Bad (or suggestions!):  *Offer a drink on arrival especially when it's hot offer a cold towel to cool down - perhaps increase your reception services by having more check-in desks (there is room on the sides).  *Whilst there a wedding reception took place-music kept the hotel up (and I mean everyone) for a few hours past mid night. I did complain and the general manager provided concessions for which I was grateful for. Didn't help the wedding party were terrible! treated guests and staff with disdain. Suggest better vetting of wedding party... although some guests will never behave and we all have people we know like that - right?  *Building works had started on the last 2 days of the trip when we were there. We were assured we wouldn't be disturbed. However as the main pool was next to it - it didn't help. Only during the day but not after 5pm. The staff tried their best with alternatives but no running away from the noise.  *The gym seemed ok nothing amazing (no AC) Pool a little disappointing - felt sterile and just 'there' - if that makes sense.  *We had a kitchenette in the room but it didn't have cutlery or bowls/glasses etc We had to regularly ask for this when it should be automatically equipped.  *Green credentials not great regarding bath towels etc  *Better coms from concierge as we never had confirmations of trips or reservations. Unless we physically asked. Assuming it's all booked is no substitute than knowing it's done via feedback especially if children are involved.    In Summary a good place to visit and worth a stay but room for improvement. The noise pollution needs to be looked at and website should've advised of this. Moreover look at the green credentials of hotel and environmental sustainability as thought this was lacking. I would go again and would hope on my next stay some improvements have taken place.,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ric_London_007

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Bart-VC-antwerp wrote a review Jul 2019,50,Wow - just wow!,Just returned from a week in Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech. A family of 4 incl 2 daughters age 13 and 10. Reality is at least as good as the pics. In fact much of the beaty and the quality of rooms resto's etc outperforms the images online. The family suite is just incredible. Bedrooms dressings bathrooms terraces ... the whole picture is perfect.  We've had full board - not necessary looking at the breakfast :-) - but nice to have for the days you stay at the pool. It was by far the best experience we've ever had in HB or FB all over the world. Both the choice (a la carte) and the service is just incredible. Special thx to these guys (Said Aissam Achraf Oussama and definitely Rahal and Rabi - but I still forget half of them - you were all amazing!).  The pool is what you see - perfect for relaxing all day long. Not that much fun for kids (no diving :-)) - but great as a family and for adults to chill and just enjoy the atmosphere. Again the staff was so warm - helping out with everything the whole stay (Adil Khalid Ajoob big thx!)..  We've also booked some of our trips (Atlas mountains and airballoon) via the hotel. Maybe a little more expensive - but the advantage is that you have a private coach a driver that is 100% focused on your joy and you don't stop at shops and other stuff you don't feel like. Would recommend it for sure. Also the shuttle system to go to the city is very convenient. Both drivers were extremely friendly and helped us to understand the country better.  We didn't go for golfing this time - but having seen the greens and country club it's a reason by itself to return.  Basically it's one of these holidays that exceed expectations by far - if we are to return to Marrakech no doubt it will be in this hotel. Definitely as a family it beats Mamounia and Royal Mansour. Okay their standards are extremely high but would not like it with kids. And - okay that's personal - I just prefer the complete style of Fairmont Royal Palm.  So what can be improved? Concierge and reception. Nothing wrong as such. But travelling all over the world all year long the level of welcoming communication and support from this division is not yet at par with for instance Four Seasons or most Asian resorts. Or just with the level of the rest of the staff in Royal Palm. Again no complaints but just not top.,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Antwerp, Belgium",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bart-VC-antwerp

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,MarsMars2020 wrote a review Jun 2019,30,Beautiful place with bad service,Nothing to complain about the facility and the location the vegetation and the surrounding are simply stunning. However the service is not proper for a 5-star hotel: despite the upgrade which we of course appreciated we waited more than half an hour for getting our room ready we found many ants in our room and despite our calls the staff arrived after half an hour service at the pool is very bad there is only one person who is overwhelmed by the number of people attending the pool and sunbeds are not enough for all the guests.    The worst thing is that the concierge refused to book us a taxi to the airport: he told us that we could only use the car from the hotel (for only 50 euros when a taxi charged 25euro approx). Basically guests are left with no choice but reaching the airport with the hotel shuttle.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Albert A wrote a review Jun 2019,40,Sustainable?,Beautiful hotel with an excellent breakfast buffet selection. The gardens are stunning and well maintained. We played 3 golf courses during our stay and the Fairmont course was the most beautiful. As there aren't too many fairway bunkers it's quite an easy course though. Staff are all friendly and helpful. The hotel is about 15 minutes out from The Medina and a round trip taxi will cost you about €30  Like most hotels these days there's a card in the bathroom advising on the re-use of towels to help conserve natural resources. However there are no towel rails in the bathroom (not in suite 212 anyway) so where we are supposed to place our towels for re-use escapes me.  If you want a room overlooking the golf course you need a room on an upper floor as a ground floor room will only give you a view of the gardens.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Doha, Qatar",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/852alberta

HOWEVER - the positives end there.    I have no idea how this hotel has such good reviews. There seems to be no organisation no communication one person says one thing one says another.... including when you are trying to find out who is in charge!    Individually you can see the staff running around and trying to help... but nothing seems to work properly!    We are travelling with young children and from the moment we were collected from the airport- it’s been a catalogue of failures.... we’re lucky if we can find a place other than room service to feed our children dinner at a reasonable time... because they stop serving as and when they decide... different each day! Ridiculous!    I’m so confused by the management’s response nothing is really taken seriously lots of fire fighting going on but not thinking about the guests overall experience or opinion.    No idea how the Fairmont brand is backing this place !

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Luv2Travel_1979 wrote a review May 2019,50,An amazing stay!,From start to finish this was an amazing trip. We had booked transport from the airport to the hotel via their Concierge Khalid who we had emailed. We were at the hotel within 15/20 minutes.    During our stay Khalid was able able to answer all our questions and gave great tips on how to make the best of our trip into town. He went out of his way to double check our flight details as there was some confusion on the airlines website and helped with all our restaurant reservations.    Check in was very smooth. We had arrived at 10am and after a short wait (we were offered a drink in the bar during this time) we were taken to our suite (Deluxe Garden view). The suite was very clean the bathroom itself is massive. There was a private terrace with garden furniture sofas and sun loungers. The living room had a TV mini bar with coffee making facilities. Faultless.    The pool area is huge. Plenty of loungers and the pool attends are great. Very friendly and helpful. One in particular looked after our needs every day Ayoub. I don’t particularly like sitting directly in the sun and Ayoub made sure the parasols were always placed so we were in the shade. Small things like keeping the ice bucket topped up to keep our drinks cool to remembering the drinks we like made our stay even more special so thank you Ayoub we are very grateful. There is a kids pool (I believe it is shallow) but there is no dedicated adults only area but this didn’t bother us.    Food was ... I can’t think of a better word then amazing! Breakfast buffet had fresh juice cereals homemade yogurts and coulis bread station pastry station cheese and meat savoury table egg station and pancakes and waffles. Fresh fruits and teas and coffees .... just yum!    When we didn’t eat out we ate at the Moroccan Buffet. I believe this buffet was only during the month of Ramadan and was outside (I might be wrong). Again the food was amazing. Traditional Moroccan feast - Iftar and it was delicious. We actually ate here most evenings as there were slight variations every evening that was perfect for us. Staff here were very attentive.    There is a shuttle that takes you into town and brings you back at set times. This worked out perfectly for us and the driver was great. Local music and lights in the evening in the van made it a fun journey.    A note I must add is that most of the people working at the hotel were fasting and yet you would not have known this - even when attending to us in 37 degrees heat!! So professional.

The check in was swift with friendly staff they brought us to our room and showed us everything we needed to know. The breakfast selection was excellent we always looked forward to it the only issue I had was we were served cold coffee one morning the staff did always appear to be under pressure it would be better to have staff responsible for certain tables. We had dinner in the 2 restaurants which were both excellent great quality food and service. We had the barbecue one night in the bar didn’t like to have crisps served with the food instead of rice potatoes or Chips which was disappointing never had crisps with lamp and chicken!!  We made good use of the tennis courts and squash courts I would recommend the hotel to have a booking time slot for the squash court as I was asked to leave after 25 minutes to let someone else play 45 mins should be allowed here.  Khalid in concierge was our standout person the whole week nothing was too much trouble he organised a half day trip to the souks quad bikes to the lakes and some good restaurants in Marrakesh when we returned he would always ask how we got on to make sure we had enjoyed ourselves which made our holiday.

Huge pools big rooms and much larger spa/workout/kids club than expected for a hotel with under 150 rooms.    The staff were also some of the best I've experienced. There was a warmth that isn't usually there at hotels and it started with the staff being so nice and always remembering our name.    There were a few negatives which I spoke to the management about and that could easily be fixed. Restaurants don't open until 7pm so tough with small kids. Concierge wasn't overly knowledgeable but still good for booking taxis. Housekeeping often didn't speak English well enough to understand what I wanted - usually saying 'yes sir' and then the wrong thing bring brought.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Jodie S wrote a review Apr 2019,40,Lives up to it’s expectations,This resort is beautiful with both it’s atmosphere and architecture. The facilities are very good; the gym is fully equipped with Techno Gym machines as well as an outdoor lap pool. The golf course (according to my sons and husband) is lovely and the driving range is of a high quality too with club hire and access to the golfing facilities not too expensive. Although none of my family have been to the spa it is opposite our residence (B) and looks wonderful. The pool is lots of fun for children with bridges that they can swim under and there is also a separate children’s pool for the younger ones (although it doesn’t have any slides etc. in it). There is a lot of space around the pool and so even when the hotel is fully booked (as it was for our stay) you are never sat within 5 or 6 metres of another group of people. The rooms themselves are of the quality you’d expect from a 5* resort: clean (not just any clean Monica from Friends clean!) spacious and nicely furnished. The balcony of our room has a table with two chairs and then an outdoor sofa with a beautiful view of the golf course and the Atlas Mountains in the distance.  As for the resort staff they are all very helpful and speak English very well. One concierge in particular called Khalid was especially helpful in organising a trip for our family to the old town of marrakech. He suggested beautiful places for dinner the best market shops and the best sights to see if rushed for time.  Regarding the restaurants be warned if you go to the traditional Moroccan restaurant! The aperitifs on arrival were described as being free but they were most definitely not - the equivalent of £50 for a glass of champagne! The food at the Moroccan restaurant was rather bland and the service consistently felt rushed and frantic. However the international restaurant had a beautiful setting and the food was delicious. BUT if you are VEGETARIAN be warned that there is hardly anything at all to eat - just the usual risotto!  All in all the resort is wonderful and lives up to the expectations of a 5* Fairmont resort however it is nowhere near exceeding those expectations.  If you are looking for a short get away with sun this resort is perfect especially considering it is only a 20 minute drive from the airport.

The bar is very comfortable and the bar staff very efficient and attentive- my husband had a cold and and Mohammad made him a ‘special drink’ with ginger and other ingredients to help his sore throat.  We ate in the bar a couple of times you can have freshly made sushi or food from the barbecue which was delicious although it’s a shame they serve homemade crisps with the barbecue and not french fries or potatoes.  We also ate in the Moroccan restaurant which was very good food and excellent service and the Mediterranean which again was great.  The restaurant by the pool is excellent for a late lunch and the food and service is very good but it would be better if it didn’t close at 4.30pm so you were able to have an evening meal there.  We played golf 3 times it’s a beautiful well maintained course not too difficult and very walkable at this time of year. Hotel guests also get a reduced green fee costing 500 dirhams.  We didn’t eat at the golf club but lots of people were and the food looked very good.  This hotel is great but it’s the attentive staff that makes it!  We will definitely come back!

Minibar was filled regularly never met the room lady but everything was clean and prepared. The golf course is nice not too difficult but very enjoyable. Golf clubhouse is beautiful worth to have a lunch and spend some time in it even if someone is a Hotel guest.

They also couldn’t give food before 12:30 but after 12:30 no one come and give us menu. Finally we was hungry and angry after airport. Personal so slowly they don’t care at all what you ask.

They have golf carts available for a ride however it is usually a wait to get one so I walked and lugged my big suitcase up 2 flights of stairs. The rooms are spacious and very nicely appointed -- along with a huge bathtub and walk in shower.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Rob Jupp wrote a review Jan 2019,50,New Year in Marrakech - 💎 of a Hotel,We visited this wonderful establishment to celebrate New Year 2018/2019 and stayed for 6 nights in a Junior Suite. We knew the hotel was fully booked prior to our arrival due to the fact that it was the New Year’s period. That said the hotel never felt crowded.    The hotel is set our in four separate buildings conveniently named ‘A to D.’ ‘A’ is the nearest to the main building (which contains reception the hotels bar and three restaurant) and ‘D’ is the furthest away and about a 7 minute walk. The hotel provide chauffeured golf buggies so you can be as lazy or active as you want.    The hotel is built around a fine golf course. I’m not a golfer but I do appreciate what a great course looks like and this one is right up there. The gardens are absolutely beautiful with countless numbers of orange and olive trees.    Our room was lovely and was big enough for our family of 4. Our Junior Suite had enough room for 2 beds for our boys ages 14 and 10 as well as an enormous bathroom and walk in wardrobe with the added advantage of a huge balcony with not only a table and chairs but also a large sofa and coffee table. We also had the most beautiful views of the Atlas Mountains.    We arranged all our trip via the hotels concierge and special praise to Souad who arranged a half day private walking tour of central Marrakech as well as a camel safari. She also arranged a private cooking experience in the hotels very own farm. This is a must! It’s an amazing experience where the family are able to watch as ingredients are gathered from a beautiful garden and then cooked (with the experienced eye of the main Moroccan chef) in an outside kitchen. You then get the chance to eat what’s been produced. Memory making of the highest quality!    We did the NYE package at hotels Moroccan restaurant and their NYD brunch. Both highly recommended and thanks to the formidable Meryem for looking after us so well.    The main restaurant is Carvane and under the watchful eye of the hotels amazing French Head Chef I predict that it may achieve the first Michelin Star 🌟 in the whole of Morocco it’s really that good.    The hotel is located around 25 minutes from central Marrakech but they provide regular shuttles free of charge. This was an attraction to us and not a negative as after a long day or night in the bedlam of the city and return to rural peace and 5 star serenity is perfect.    Final mention to Sanae in the hotels PR department. From the moment she checked us in and throughout she was a joy. Really interested in my family and on hand to provide thoughtful and kind touches.    Final point is when we visited the hotel was mostly occupied by French nationals. Again this wasn’t a negative but just a noted observation.    We will be returning. I can’t understand why this hotel doesn’t occupy a place in the top 10 in Marrakech. We stayed at the Four Seasons last time we visited Marrakech and the Fairmont wins hands down.    Well done all.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,sammy wrote a review Dec 2018,40,"beautiful property, luxury experience, some minor issues",i stayed in a family suite at the royal palm with my parents and my sister (22) for 4 nights.    ROOM DETAILS  -two twin beds one king  -two very spacious bathrooms  -large lounge space  -deck with furniture and golf course view    BEST  -hotel design and atmosphere: the design of the hotel itself captured a beautiful modern african/arab atmosphere  -staff: everyone we interacted with was kind warm and helpful including the maids concierges and restaurant staff  -breakfast buffet: tons of options (egg chef breads pastries jams vegetables meats cheeses fruits juices etc.    WORST  -wifi: weak signal at times no wifi at all in our room for the first night  -cleanliness: found many little ants around the room throughout our stay  -hotel restaurants: only 2 options and VERY expensive. this makes it hard to come back early for a night in because the hotel is far from town and requires a shuttle so unless you want to spend a lot at the hotel restaurants you best stay in town until late.    OTHER NOTES  -location: this is a tricky one. my family loved how the hotel was tucked away in a quiet area about 40 minutes outside of the popular areas with the souks and the riads. we also are the kind of people that go into town for the day and don't return until it's time to go to sleep. however if you are the kind of person who likes to go back to the hotel even just once to have a break in your day you might struggle. the hotel shuttle only picks up from certain locations at certain times so it's a challenge getting to and from town.  -villa style: the family suites are in villas that you have to take a golf cart to get to and and from the lobby. again good if you like quiet bad if you don't like waiting. we had to call the lobby to send a golf cart for us everytime we wanted to leave our room. never took more than 10 minutes to come tough but we visited during a quiet time for the hotel.,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sammyapp
Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Peter B wrote a review Nov 2018,40,Luxury hotel with some very minor flaws,We decided some time ago to partially escape Swiss winter time and spend a week at the Fairmont. We booked this hotel as we know the Fairmont Group from previous stays. Furthermore we liked the proximity of the Golf Course (directly at the hotel to be reached by golf buggy in a couple of minutes) appealed to us as well. We were not disappointed. The location of the hotel not far away from the airport is great. Nice 3 story main building (and all other buildings with the rooms as well) are in modern Moroccan style. The hotel its vast gardens and the rooms are very well maintained. Our junior suite on the 2nd floor with view on the Atlas mountains was very spacious comfortably and luxuriously furnished. The bathroom and walking closet was immense. The only negative point was the very low water pressure in the shower and the extraordinary slow reaction of the mixing tap from warm to cold and vice versa. All the rooms are in buildings (about 5 of them) away from the main building where the 2 restaurants the bar etc. are located you either have to walk or you can order a buggy to get you from outside your building to the main one. In winter time depending on the temperatures it would be wise to have appropriate outfits with you .... as was the case during our stay in November.  Unfortunately there was a group event during the whole week which prevented us to eat more than once at the Moroccan restaurant. The other nights we had dinner at the main one (except for one). Being on half board this meant that we were limited to the menus offered. There could be a wider choice. The dish to be recommended most is the filet de boeuf which we had twice. Excellent quality of the meat and cooked to the desired point. All the rest in both restaurants was okay but we surely missed the authentic flavor of the Moroccan spices etc. For our taste everything was to bland..... For half board guests the lack of choice in restaurants (under these circumstances) was cumbersome. Service overall in the hotel was very attentive and helpful throughout our stay; some communication problems sometimes arose due lack of Englisch and/or French language skills. The receptionist Mr. Ouadia was very helpful in sorting some issues out. Same applies to Mr. Al Chayeb who addressed all issues raised by me in a very professional and understanding way. The surprises prepared at the occasion of my birthday were really very kind and generous. Again many thanks to all for these!,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Zurich, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/295PeterB
Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Ankibollen wrote a review Nov 2018,50,Arabian luxury,Me and my fiancé went to Marocco to celebrate our 20th anniversary. The Fairmont royal palm is one of the most spectacularly luxurious hotel we’ve had the pleasure of visiting. The decode was tasteful and warm the room bathroom and closet was spacious. The view of the Atlas Mountains from the balcony was gorgeous. So lots of dinner was enjoyed at the balcony. The hotel was extremely big and since the weather was extremely hot the hotel provided buggy service. So you could call for a buggy to pick you up and take you to wherever you want to go inside the hotel premises.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Monica K wrote a review Nov 2018,40,Breathtaking setting with some flaws,Entering the hotel you have a spectacular view of the Atlas mountains. We booked a suite with Atlas view and got upgraded to the second floor which I would recommend to book as the view is just stunning.The room was very spacious with a beautiful terrace overlooking the golf course and the Atlas.  The main pool was heated which is perfect for an early morning swim.  Even though the hotel seemed quite crowded the grounds are so large you still had your privacy.  But there are some small things I would expect from a hotel of this category:  At arrival our room wasn’t ready and we had lunch at the terrace they offered us welcome tea which never arrived. We were three people using the suite so they also put an extra bed in the living room. But there were only two towels two bathrobes and two glasses. We called the reception to get those additional items; additional glass and bathrobe never arrived (even after asking several times).  Also ordering a golf car to drive us to the entrance (it’s quite far away) was rather a gamble. Sometimes it arrived sometimes you had to walk.  Breakfast is great; the quality and variety of food is amazing but also there ordering a coffee you could be lucky or you had to remind the waiter 10 times until you got it.  Those are only small things and the staff is super friendly so you couldn’t really get angry but I expect this attention to details when I stay at such a hotel.  Still I would go back as the place itself is magical.,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MonicaK355

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Antoine F wrote a review Oct 2018,20,Very disappointing,So :    - food is really not good. Burgers are the only dish acceptable and the chicken tandoori. The rest is really not good. And the waiters think it is ok to tell their clients that they no longer have ketchup at the pool restaurant when you just have to go ask the other restuarant for it    - service is terrible. I can't count the number of time I asked for something 3 or 4 times which never came. By the way it was great of them to let me take the luggages out of the car AND to leave them under the rain while waiting for the room to be ready for check in (which was fine we were early)    Reading other reviews it s probably a great hotel is you come for family holidays (nice pool for the kids and golf hole) but def not for a couple with no kids who want to eat decent & acceptable food.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Fred T wrote a review Oct 2018,40,Good Holliday family plan,5 days at Royal Palm with the family. 5 star hotel that is my opinion is more a 4 star plus. The hotel is very nice and the staff extremely friendly but a little slow. Perfect destination for few days of family vacation in my opinion best place for family in Marrakech. We had suite 260 two bedrooms and big living room big terrasse with amazing view of the Atlas.  If you play golf its the perfect destination. The golf course is gorgeous and well maintained (rarely the case in Marrakech).  Pools are nice kids club ok for kids under 10.  The hotel is 25min drive from the town. You will not enjoy Marrakech by night from Royal Palm.  The best for a week there is probably 4-5 days at royal plan and a couple's of night at La Mamounia the hotel near the city.  The main downside of the Royal Palm is the food. None of the restautants offer sophisticated food. Is ok but a little short for a 5stars.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/807fredt

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Corrado BXL wrote a review Oct 2018,40,An oasis of tranquility that offers a delightful experience,This resort is an 'oasis' - as far away from the chaos of the city as one looking for relief can hope for.  The property is exquisite with tranquil pools surrounded by walking areas and beautifully maintained gardens. The hotel and facilities are great with a lovely setting. I had a ground floor junior suite which was superb. The room was large and spacious with my own terrace. The wardrobe and the bathroom so expansive and indulgent. Minibar was free and the WiFi connection was very good. Everyone I encountered from everywhere in the property were so friendly eager to assist and full of smiles. The experience at the Moroccan restaurant (the one located at the upper floor of the main/reception building). The staff there was really welcoming and extremely helpful and entertaining too. Unfortunately the experience at the bar and at the open restaurant facing the bar area was not in line with the set expectations. Although the quality of the food was excellent (high quality ingredients) at the bar: when serving the requested drinks the difference between a mojito and a virgin (no-alcohol) mojito was hardly recognized as well as who ordered what. At the restaurant: a bit too long waiting time between the serving of the meals and to get the bill at the end of the lunch.    All extras are a bit pricey but overall for a luxury hotel like this value for money rather reasonable. The only improvement I see is the speed of providing a resort golf car for rooms that are quite far from the lobby. Although I fully understand that my calls for this service were placed during “rush hours” in a couple of instances I had to wait for about 10 minutes before someone was available to pick me up. May be in these situations is worth to inform the host about the “rush hours” possible waiting time to better manage the expectations for this service.    In a nutshell a beautiful setting well maintained with all facilities top notch with highly attentive and friendly staff.

Lovely setting great pool and another pool and sports facilities just for good measure. The rooms are spacious and the grounds well maintained.    Housekeeping great job with the room attended to several times. Lovely touch with the free minibar.  Where could it improve I think some basics on displaying either in the room on on the tv services what times things are open and what’s available. There was no display of what the spa offered or any of the other facilities. This should be very easy to add to the guest services tv menu.    The staff seem to be putting the effort in with the pool service really good and a great sense of humour! 2 slightly different experiences with the restaurants with the Moroccan one having really welcoming staff and extremely helpful whilst the main restaurant below a comedy of errors starting with the girl on the front desk.

If this is what you are looking for by all means--the Fairmont is a great property. There were many nice touches [beautiful pool area dramatic decor candles throughout the property after dark] however we found the atmosphere to be a bit quiet and uptight for our tastes--and even got yelled at by our neighbors for ""talking too loud"" while enjoying lunch on our room's patio.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,travelbee77l wrote a review Aug 2018,50,Beautiful place,After few days spent at resort downtown marrakech. My family and I head to Fairmont for some quiet time and especially some golf fun for my husband.  The hotel was very beautiful perfect for a gateway for adults and kids . Our suite was on point very fancy clean definitely a 👍🏼👍🏼. Our kid enjoyed the kids club which was a really fun time with private pool games  computer access .. so a break for us the parents to enjoy the golf and the pool. However the golf course was nice  but only few holes were maintained and the rest was I believe under construction. A little disappointment for my husband who was excited for it  as we read about it before.  We always had breakfast and lunch at the hotel. Breakfast was good besides the omelette station was slow but they turned out delicious. Various choices at the kids station too: waffles.. cereals..french crepes.However I should give a big thumbs up to the teAm !! The food was sooo delicious and we felt so pampered by the restaurant manager Mr.MediiHe was so attentive and from day one  he introduced himself and made us so comfortable that we felt we were the only ones having breakfast/lunch .My husband and I were so amazed with his kindness and professionalism especially that the place was always busy and he always had time to come check on us and make sure we were good! What a royal service from his part! He even remembered our name and addressed us with it every time we come!That’s a unique kind of service ! His team was also very nice and friendly worked really hard to cover every detail!(especially MR. Badr our favorite waiter)  However there was one detail I did not appreciate at all! I’m not sure if that was the general restaurant manager (seemed a top management guy) was not too friendly nor discrete!On our last lunch at olive restaurant  we witnessed him making comments and addressing his pears loudly something that is out of standards for such a place or anywhere! which was so uncomfortable 😣  Overall we are so pleasured to have spent our last days in marrakech at Fairmont and we are already planing for our next time here!    Oh and also the prices are very attractive!,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelbee77l
Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Elaine0105 wrote a review Aug 2018,50,Wonderful Resort Hotel,We have just returned from a 6 night stay at The Fairmont Royal Palm and can not recommend it highly enough. Traveling as a family of 4 inc 2 teenage boys the experience from start to finish was superb.    Highlights:  The hotel organised a fast track service through the airport which made everything so streamlined.  Perfect check in with drinks in the bar whilst the paperwork was completed.  The Presidents Suite was huge beautiful terraces and exceptionally well laid out. The complimentary fridge stocked with soft drinks and water was particularly welcome. As was the daily fruit bowl and sweet snacks.  Stunning pool great staff comfortable loungers.  We stayed half board the restaurants were excellent. Over breakfast little touches like the waiters remembering how you take your Moroccan tea added to the positive experience. Friendly staff the Restaurants Manager introduced himself on the first day nice touch giving an impression of accountability.  Across all areas from the concierge spa sports centre pool restaurants to housekeeping the level of service was exceptional.  The resort has a very tranquil feel and is beautifully looked after.    Thoroughly recommend and we will definitely return.,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elaine0105

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Ann B wrote a review Aug 2018,50,A Haven in the Heat,My partner and I have just come back from a 7 night trip booked through a well known airline. We arrived fairly late (around 2030) only to be told that they had no record of our booking!!  However they did have rooms and would sort something out. They were outstanding we were whisked away to have a complementary drink whilst they sorted out the problem.  I can not praise all the hotel staff enough everyone (and I mean everyone) was so helpful and polite nothing was too much trouble.  It was off season for them so they were not too busy but even so the standard did not slip. I have stayed in many many 5* hotels and this didn't disappoint. The only downside was the fact that a couple of the restaurants were closed because it was the low season which we were told in advance. However the food that was on offer in the two remaining restaurants was varied enough.  The extra large pool had plenty of sunbeds to choose from  either around the poolside or in the gardens with shade offered by olive trees.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Loughton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annb334

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Ravinder L wrote a review Jul 2018,10,Not even 4 star,Nice surroundings facilities look well kept golf course lools nice BUT this is not 5 star and not even a 4 star. The reasons:    1. The staff have not been trained to do anything remotely close to 5 star quality given the experience we had for dinner    2. The hotel was possibly of 10% occupancy but food was clold and served in a very poor way.    3. When I rang beforehand to check for the best family restaurant the end result being they allocated us in restaurant with a limted menu. When asked if we could move to another restaurant the staff made us feel very uncomfortable.    4. We provided this feedback to the duty manager. She took this onboard and actually agreed with our points. I felt it was a but insulting she took rice off our bill but hey whats done is done.    5. If the Fairmont is what Morccans feel is 5 star quality then they need to go and see the rest of the world. This place is expensive amd not value of a 5 star.    As mentioned in my other reviews I have seen much of the world. You sometimes want experience high quality and sometimes its good to be in touch with the normal way of life for most. I consider my self well rounded but unfortunately have to safe negative things about this place.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/7ravinderl
Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,MJR wrote a review Jul 2018,40,Great Pool day pass,We came here for a pool day to escape the hectic Medina of Marrakech where we were staying. The hotel offers a summer special day pass for 550 DH inclusive of two course snack lunch.    It was great! It's a little tricky to get to as it involves inevitable haggling with taxi drivers trying to rip you off from the city as it's such a long way out but once there it is like an oasis of calm and luxury.    The staff could not be more attentive if they tried. From arrival it's like you're the most important person in the world treated like a celebrity. We were shown the gym and spa areas (the gym entry was an additional fee of 500 DH pp).    According to my fiancé who is an avid gym goer this was the best gym in the world. The resident trainer / caretaker is an absolute champ who entertained him and helped him and was apparently absolutely incredible so he deserves a commendation. The spa facilities I used were amazing I had a massage which was lovely and a little chill out around the pool area in the spa complex which is light airy and beautiful.    The main pool facilities are wonderful with a huge pool which is clean and well maintained. Sun loungers were made available and the attentive staff suggest where we should lie if we want to relax/ be away from kids or crowds and the like.    Drinks were charged additionally to the day pass and they are mid-range to be expected in fees for a large chain hotel. The selection was good.    The main hotel is like nothing I have ever seen. Luxury to the max. Floral scents make this seem opulent and the detail of the design is simply breathtaking. I loved it here and it was like a mini holiday within a holiday.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hoylake, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adventures_and_cats

From the moment we arrived at the front entrance of the Fairmont hotel we knew this was an amazing venue & wasn’t going to let us down and we were right!  Our room was amazing better then any other 5 star hotels we have recently stayed at - clean private spacious and comfortable. We had a mini bar where complimentary water and soft drinks were available at our convenience which was great with the kids. Amine at reception and Isabelle the front office manager couldn’t have been more accommodating nothing was ever too much trouble. All of the staff front reception concierge restaurant housekeeping golf cart drivers other were amazing and truly service driven!  I can not say enough about how special the staff truly all were and helped in making our stay so much more special.  The location is 20 mins from town but we were quite happy with that as the complimentary shuttle bus drops you in the old or new town every 2 hours and even the bus driver was very helpful.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,SFOLAXIAHORD wrote a review Jul 2018,50,The Prince Villa was SO worth it,Just completed a wonderful stay in a Prince Villa. We’re so glad we had the pool given the summer heat.    With the Prince Villa Fairmont’s service started at the airport with both Fast Track service through immigration and a private vehicle from the airport included with the stay. Warm and friendly representatives met us at the airport terminal. The ride to the resort from the airport is about 20-30 minutes.    The resort itself is beautiful. It truly feels like an oasis out in the desert. Admittedly some of this is due to its distance from the medina (the only drawback) but it really was like paradise for us.    Once we arrived at the property the great service continued at check in and on the buggy ride to our villa. The villa was just stunning with high ceilings and the decor had an understated elegance. The backyard was equally stunning with the pool a seating area and chaise lounges.    The food at the hotel was very good. The breakfast buffet has a wide variety of choices. we also had lunch by the shared pool which was excellent as well. The team that served us at breakfast were out by the pool serving lunch.    Most of the time English was not an issue but it’s probably best to reconfirm what you requested from the concierge housekeeping etc to ensure everyone is on the same page on expectations.

Haffid truly personalized the experienced. In addition we met other staff members that were amazing and I am ashamed of myself for not remembering their names. One of them who was extremely attentive was taking us from the lobby to our rooms and to our dinner with the golf cart and I really want the hotel to know that he creates memories and it was great for us to know that he spoke several languages. We speak Spanish and he spoke Spanish as well so it was nice to have someone who spoke our language. We were also amazed to see beautiful candles around the property it makes the place more romantic and desirable.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Christopher H wrote a review May 2018,20,A Royal Palm but not The Royal Palm,We visited the Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech between the 23rd and 30th of April following my wife’s big birthday! … unfortunately we were extremely disappointed with our stay at the hotel.    My understanding is that the Royal Palm is still owned by Beachcomer and now managed by Fairmont and in theory compatible with the Royal Palm Mauritius … it isn’t the Royal Palm Mauritius is in a totally different league in all respects with most notably quality of service attention to detail cuisine.    A few examples during our stay in Marrakech:  There was a bowl of three apples in our room when we arrived with one remaining when we left. The fruit was not covered and the original knife was still present and stained from prior use.  Small cakes and pastries were left in our room again uncovered.  In the bar drinks were served with nuts and olives … we noted screwed up silver paper and other debris in the nuts indicated they were being reused.  One evening the main restaurant was closed for a private function and we had not been informed … the prior night our waiter had reserved us a table.  On Sunday there was a buffet lunch … basically take it or leave it. The alternative was room service or use the Golf Club facility again not advertised to guests.  The Concierge had no literature maps or tour information available to guests … our table waiter managed to find a used Royal Palm map showing its location in relation to Marrakech and 10 ‘Curiosites’.  We found Tour Operators covered pickups at central hotels but didn’t venture out to the Royal Palm leaving only the hotel shuttle bus to get in/out of Marrakech.  There was no menu of services in the hotel … covering for example the excellent Gym Racket facilities Spa Golf Course etc.  We asked for towels to use with our room sun loungers … and had the same towels for the whole week.  Restaurant table clothes were stained and holed.  Choice quality and presentation of food was not as expected and with very limited traditional Moroccan spiced dishes … even in their Moroccan restaurant.  Finally during our week there were a substantial number of families with young children from breakfast through to evening dinner.    I apologise for being negative but their marketing £4000 half board and £800 extras was not good value for money.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cheltenham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christopherhP3238HK
Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,NinaTravel24 wrote a review Apr 2018,50,True oasis in Marrakech!!,We had travelled to Marrakech looking for an escape from our hectic lives and am happy to say at the Fairmont Royal Palm was just perfect and exactly what we needed — it is truly an oasis! The property has recently been rebranded to a Fairmont which I was very excited about as I am very familiar with the brand having stayed in a number of their hotels in North America. It’s always nice to experience that familiarity you come to expect when staying with your favourite hotel chain — not necessarily only in the physical aspects (which is just stunning) but also through the service and that innate warm feeling you get like visiting family. The new management must be doing it right because we certainly got that feeling from the “bienvenue” to the “bon voyage”.    At first I was worried about the resort being a 20-minute drive from the main sites and downtown but once we arrived I was so happy to be away from all the hustle and bustle and just experience peacefulness (well besides the chirping birds and crickets at night). I think the favourite part for me was being able to see the starry skies in the evening while walking down the candles lit pathway back to our suite after dinner.    We treated ourselves to a Prince Villa accommodation looking for the extra space and the idea of having our own private pool and gardens seemed perfect for our getaway. And boy were we not disappointed — it was the ultimate in understated contemporary luxury with a spacious living and dining area which we took advantage of with some amazing room service meals. The bedroom itself is quite large with a super comfy bed a huge walk-in closet with his-and-hers areas and plenty of space to fully unpack for a week-long visit. The en suite bathroom is a dream with a double vanity large soaker tub glass rain shower and an outdoor shower surrounded by lush greenery and the blue sky overhead. My only suggestion for improvement here is to have more towel holders available!    Now the outdoor private pool and gardens — this alone was worth every penny. Immediately outside living room a lovely covered terrace and sitting area where breakfast and coffee was enjoyed daily while taking in the mild weather and watching the playful birds hop around from palm tree to olive tree. The pool is a just a perfect size big enough to paddle or float around in; though not heated the dip is a refreshing reprise from the Moroccan heat. The gardens are lush and green and well manicured plenty of grassy space to spread out a mat for some morning yoga and nicely set up with 4 sun loungers that are conveniently under the swaying branches of palm trees. A large dining table under a trellis and your own private hammam steam room completes the luxe gardens. Tough life!    There are 3 restaurants at the hotel plus a bar and another restaurant and bar located at the golf club house love that they have so many unique options. The thought of breakfast at Le Caravane was sure to get me out of bed each morning - dining outside in the early morning sun under the olive trees overlooking the pool and Atlas Mountains and birds chirping about was like something from a dream so pretty. An absolute must is the fresh buttery croissants and their yummy house-made fruit jam! Even the staff remembered my daily order of cappuccino! They also serve a lovely European a la carte dinner which can be enjoyed indoors in the lovely candle lit restaurant or outside on the terrace underneath the stars. Our dinner there was delicious and beautifully presented and I found the service staff to be quite attentive but discreet.    Lunches were enjoyed at the outdoor restaurant L’Olivier appropriately named for the numerous olive trees that the tables are perched underneath. This restaurant offers up refined casual and lighter fare perfect for those warm and sunny afternoons. The tandoori salmon served with black rice is very moist and tasty and even more enjoyable with a glass of local Pinot Gris wine.    Of course trying their Moroccan restaurant Al Ain was also a must as part of my Marrakech experience. The restaurant itself is breathtaking — as you walk over the lantern-lit bridge over the lobby towards the restaurant you get the feeling that something very special awaits you at the other end and it does not disappoint. Plush furnishings and cozy private tables adorned with tall tapered candles and a duo of traditional Moroccan musicians certainly set the mood. I opted for the pastillia dish which was rich and flavourful and the pastry so flaky! The harrira soup and lemon bread (freshly baked bread is served table side) are also a must!    The staff are extremely friendly and courteous; although things can sometimes run a bit slow (maybe just the culture?) you can tell the staff are certainly trying their very best to accommodate which is appreciated. I would categorize this resort as suitable for both a romantic couples getaway (as we did!) and also for a family vacation as they cater very well to children complete with a Kids Club.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Michellebadwa wrote a review Apr 2018,50,One of the best hotels in the world!,As expected the hotel is just amazing with its design and ambience. It is arguably the best and most iconic hotel in Marrakesh! The check in process was seamless and we were being offered a temporary room for refreshment as we were there earlier than our check in time. It was a very thoughtful welcome by the reception. Overall a very good stay and the staffs were all friendly! The hotel service is close to flawless and when it isn’t the kindness and warmth that radiates from everyone makes up for whatever little bother one may have. The grounds are gorgeous the place is an lush oasis of calm and beauty! Every stroll or excursion outside had us running back with glee to the hotel either to enjoy our beautifully appointed room overlooking the golf or to take a drink at one of the several outdoor terraces lounge at the pool have a soothing body treatment at the spa. Let’s. For us Fairmont Royal palm IS Marrakech and our one week vacation here will be in our hearts as the best we’ve had anywhere else so far.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Zal4 wrote a review Apr 2018,40,Beautiful property with some room to improve,The property is beautiful the guest rooms are very large and comfortable and the design of the hotel is lovely. The pool is enormous and the views of the mountains are incredible. The staff is friendly and obviously trying hard to please. The hotel could use additional staff in the restaurants and at the pool and perhaps some additional staff training. The biggest issue is the unreliable wifi. During our stay it ranged from spotty to nonexistent. We had the impression that the staff is aware of the problem so hopefully improvements will be made. Overall great resort for families golfers and those looking for a place to relax while doing some exploring in Marrakech.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zal4

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,JaclynJoelPAU wrote a review Apr 2018,50,Great resort and golf course,Family of two adults and a six year old.    Location: 4/5    Located roughly 15 km outside of Marrakech and about 15-20 minutes drive from the international airport (depending on traffic). As it is outside out of town it is extremely quiet and tranquil. There is no hustle and bustle or city life background noise.    The hotel provides free shuttle service every two hours into town I recommend prebooking with the concierge a day in advance.    We were looking for a relaxing quiet week long vacation to escape the rainy overcast winters of southern France less than a three hour flight away = accomplished!    ——————————————————————————  Transportation to/from airport: 4/5    We booked transportation to/from the airport through the Fairmont the driver was waiting for us upon arrival just as you exit the terminal. The multiple security checkpoints were extremely busy and backed up we were easily 1.5-2hrs exiting the airport. The car service was waiting with a Fairmont sign. The vehicle was a Mercedes 9 passengers van. The driver helped us with our bags loaded the van and off we went.    On the return transport to the airport we encountered a minor hiccup. Our flight was scheduled to depart at 8:40 we wanted to give ourselves a minimum of two hours to get checked in and board. The day before i went to the concierge desk and specified a 6:15 am shuttle departure. As we were checking out I went to confirm the with the concierge and he had the shuttle scheduled for 7:00 am. He got on the phone immediately and coordinated a driver to arrive in 20 mins after all the confusion and mixup we were only 20 mins behind schedule.    IMPORTANT: two hour arrival at airport in Marrakech (outbound flight back home) prior to departure is the minimum amount of time I would go with . 2.5-3hrs would be best if you like to have a little breathing room and want to shop at the duty free.    —————————————————————————————  First Impression: Beautiful and grand resort definitely holds up to the hype of a Fairmont establishment.  5/5    Staff: the staff were extremely welcoming and helpful. There were a lot of staff working at this resort there was always someone close by to help out but at the same time very discrete and respectful of your space and privacy. It wasn't all that busy during our stay.  5/5  _____________________________________________________________  Rooms: we stayed in a deluxe suite with a mountain view  the room was located on the first floor ( not ground level) over looking the ninth hole of the golf course. As advertised the room was extremely spacious clean and well maintained.  4/5  _____________________________________________________________  Bed Comfort: the king size bed was above average but not nothing special. The bedding was clean/white clean smell but not too strong. Pillows were plenty full and very comfortable. Our six year old son slept on the couch the resort placed a mattress on the couch with sheets comforter and pillows.  4/5  _____________________________________________________________  Breakfast: buffet but you could order specific items like poached eggs or eggs Benedict. To be honest the breakfast buffet was nothing to write home about. We particularly enjoyed the freshly cut mango but unfortunately it was available each and every day. Dinning out on the terrace was fantastic on sunny mornings. The killer was the price 33€ per person (same price for our six year old) to me is a little over priced - 100 € for breakfast seems a little pricey. For that price I expect Moët champaign to be free flowing from 7-10 am :-)  Some of the food wasn’t hot served from the buffet quite a few guests were complaining about the quality. Definitely some minor tweak are needed to improve the guest experience and provide a true five star experience.  3/5  _____________________________________________________________  Restaurants:  Le Caravane = just ok nothing special (ate here one evening)    L’Olivier (poolside lunch restaurant and bar) = great menu quality food good drinks (had lunch here one afternoon wish we would have gone a few other times to try other items from the menu)    Al Aïn (upstairs Moroccan) = great menu good food decent wine list a little expensive. They had a some live music playing.    Sabra (restaurant at the golf course) = we ate here more than the other places as we would gab drinks and a bite after golf. More often drinks then food as our son putted on the awesome putting greens just of the restaurant terrace. Great drinks decent options on the menu good food decent price.    Overall dinning experience:  3/5 we weren't blown away by the food  _____________________________________________________________  Facilities:    Kids Club: the kids club is amazing the facility is huge very clean and lots of stuff for the kids to do. The staff are amazing! Our son asked us each and every day if he could go to the kids club. They have all kinds of daily activities and games planned to keep everyone entertained. You can also order lunch (300 MAD or 27€) and/or dinner for them and they can eat with their new friends. I cannot say enough about this service it is an amazing free of charge service offered by the resort that permits parents to relax and enjoy some quiet adult time while on vacation. The cost to sat at this resort which tends to be slightly more expensive then other resorts is justified solely based on this service. When your kids are begging to go to the kids club for the day you can't put a price on that :-)  Most days he went only for the morning and mid afternoon as we would go and use the putting chipping and range early afternoon then play nine holes of golf all together followed by bevies post round and a putting competition.  6/5  _____________________________________________________________    Internet: free but slow ( 5 mb/s) but after all you are in Africa! To be honest it was as fast as our terrible internet service in southern France.  3/5  _____________________________________________________________  Golf:  Transportation to and from the resort and course was good we rarely had to wait more than a few minutes. You have the option of storing your clubs on site - the. You could walk to the course which was five minutes away.  The practice facility is fantastic full range (unlimited golf balls) the chipping area featured multiple greens and bunkers everything you need to tighten up your short game. Putting area was amazing multiple greens multi tiered multiple holes our son spent hours playing on the putting greens.  Pro shop was ok they stocked the bare essentials.  Golf carts were good but be careful often carts were handed out with low charge and a phone call was required to have someone bring out a cart with some juice. We always played mid to late afternoon so that could be why there was from time to time a cart issue but that is no excuse.  Weather: High of +20 during the afternoon with a low of +5-10 during the evenings. Perfect weather for playing a round of golf or lounging around the pool during the warmer hours of the day.  The course was great. Tee boxes flat well maintained. Fairways were in great shape. Desert golf so no rough instead sand / dirt waste areas. Greens were in great shape fast and ran true.  Staff were at the club house and practice facility were fantastic.    Advise: book tee times in advance before arriving. Mornings are jammed pack. As we were looking to only play nine holes in the afternoon it was pretty quiet. Quite often I called an hour in advance and they were able to squeeze us on within the hour.  4.5/5    _____________________________________________________________  Overall rating 4/5  I would definitely go back to this resort especially if you can find a deal or discount. I would also recommend the fairmont Marrakech to friends. But we were not blown away.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Gelos, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaclynJoelPAU
Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Tricia M wrote a review Apr 2018,40,Beautiful resort - quite a few service issues.,First of all I have to agree 100% with the comments from @amertner. We paid a LOT of money for a high end suite but found that the service fell flat.    Very expensive dining options - on Easter Sunday there were only 2 options - a buffet that cost over $130 pp or the Golf CLub which was clearly not set up to feed the 50% of the hotel who didn't want to partake in the expensive buffet!    We asked 5 times for an in room dining menu which we never received. We ordered room service from the website menu (no prices!) which was super expensive.    When you're paying this kind of money - I would also have expected the gym to offer classes - like a morning yoga class or something. You could basically hire in a private yoga instructor (no thanks and the cost was v high) but nothing just offered.    Breakfast was great. The place is beautiful.    Overall the staff are LOVELY - especially with the kids. Rachid at the pool (and the younger guy whose name I can't remember) totally redeemed all of the Fawlty Towers service issues. The ladies who run the Kids Club also deserve major kudos. My 3 year old wanted to go everyday and frequently sent me away when I came to collect her. The woman at breakfast was super sweet.    Given what we spent I wouldn't call it value for money but like other people we enjoyed ourselves.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"San Francisco, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/79triciam
Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Allan wrote a review Apr 2018,40,"Splendid, amazing hotel with poor food options and disappointingly uncoordinated service",What do you expect when you book the best suite in a 5-star holiday resort? Me I expect excellence: I expect facilities to be superb I expect staff to have a professional attention to detail I expect the food to be great and I expect to not have to think about mundane stuff because it just gets handled and handled well.    At the Fairmont the hotel itself is gorgeous: huge rooms with large windows artfully placed light fixtures gorgeous water features etc. The Penthouse Suite was mind blowing with huge rooms and very high ceilings. The bed was huge and the bedding fantastic - we slept very well. This was what I had hoped for and I was really impressed.    Staff was almost universally very helpful and tried their best though they clearly tend to be more comfortable with French than with English :) We were also allowed late checkout to accommodate our late flight back to the UK - great thank you!    In all we had a great holiday and managed to really relax and soak up the sun.    Unfortunately there was also a lot of things that fell far short of expectations. I will list them here to help the hotel fix these for future travellers:    1) The restaurants. There are two (Moroccan and International) plus food in the bar and room service. We tried 3 of those 4 options and in all cases the food was very expensive and just not very good even though it was advertised as “gourmet” and “the best in Morocco”. This is most definitely not the case!! The fact that the menus are published on the internet but that the prices are not (not even in an in-room menu) gives you a hint as to how expensive it is but not how poor the food is.    We would love much more choice including some options that try less to be “gourmet”. If you want to know what that could be just look at the menu at “Le Grand Cafe de la Poste” in Marrakech.    2) The service at breakfast. This sometimes felt like “Fawlty Towers”: waiters clearly are not taught the basics of how to lay a table. Ensuring a clean table cloth and that everyone has a knife fork and spoon seems simple yet did not happen - every day we needed to ask for one or more of those things sometimes repeatedly. There was a lot of staff who all seemed very busy but it was also obviously uncoordinated busyness with things like plates and napkins coming out in small batches of 4 or so at a time them immediately getting snatched up.    Even getting a good cup of coffee required figuring out what to ask for: Asking for “coffee” resulted in a very very thin lukewarm drink; asking for an Americano resulted in the same thing. The trick is to ask for a double espresso and confirm that you want it “from the machine”. Be prepared to wait for a while :)    In fairness the food at breakfast was actually very good with many options and well prepared food.    3) The WiFi. Good internet connectivity is such a basic service nowadays and yet Fairmont’s WiFi coverage was astonishingly bad. In the bar we could often connect but in our suite it was difficult to get connected and more difficult to stay connected for more than a few minutes with bandwidth that was barely adequate for light browsing.    The 4G coverage in Morocco is generally excellent and the speeds good - the hotel’s poor WiFi was nowhere near as fast or as reliable.    4) Form over function. Our suite was gorgeous but it felt like those responsible for it never tried to actually live there for a few days. For example the lights are beautiful mood lights but there isn’t a single bright light not even in the dressing room or in the bathroom. The minibar fridge barely chilled its contents; I could not tell the difference between room temperature and a bottle of water from the fridge.    There also are no shelves or hooks in the bathroom and the small plunge pool is so icily cold that it’s impossible to get in - please make it a bit warm! We also managed to fall down the stairs leading up to the pool because they for some reason don’t go all the way across leaving a big hole on either side. This looks great but is quite dangerous.    5) Smoke. For some reason the living area of our suite almost always smelled quite strongly of (wood) smoke. I suspect the ventilation may draw smoke in from somewhere - but it was very noticeable every time we cam back to the room.    6) Room cleaning. It would be nice if room service was coordinated with the schedule the hotel knew we had: for example tidy the room while we are in one of the restaurants or on a trip organised by the hotel. This didn’t happen though and we had to call every day to get the room serviced. There is also a button that allows you to say “please service the room” but it seems that all it does is to illuminate a light outside the door rather than somewhere central.    It would be much closer to expectations is I could set this when going for breakfast and then come back to a serviced room without having to ask for it.    7) Nothing is nearby. This is obviously not the fault of the hotel but there is literally nothing nearby and the trip to Marrakech with the shuttle takes 30 minutes - and only runs every 2 hours. The return shuttle is also only every 2 hours and it’s not clear that taxis from Marrakech are allowed to enter the Fairmont grounds so options are limited.    An hourly shuttle service including one that can return directly from New town (rather than go to Old town and then wait for 20 minutes before returning) would be great.    Final tip: Wherever you stay in Marrakech go for the Fast Track option in the airport. It allows you to bypass the very lengthy security queues - you can book it online before you go.    For this review I was torn between 3 (too harsh) and 4 stars (too generous) and decided to go with 4 because we did manage to have a great time - I just hope the hotel addresses the shortcomings quickly.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Farzag
Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Belinda F wrote a review Apr 2018,30,Gorgeous hotel; service 3 star,The hotel is beautiful as are the rooms and views.    Unfortunately the service is frustrating. Every one is kind and helpful but there is a serious lack of organization.    Avoid eating at the bar where the wait for sushi can be over an hour. The « barbecue menu » is 600 dirhams per person for.... not much! No starter or salade or vegitables nor potatoes nor dessert. We waited one hour and got a plat of over cooked and seriously cold meat. Not even any bread. We left.    Bagage pick up at 8:00 three days before our departure. None on the day we asked.    Restaurant reservations often « lost” between concierge and the restaurant.    Spa had me wait for 30 Minutes for my daughter before admitting they thought maybe she had left as they had made a mistake on her treatment...no one was sure....    Etc    For arrivals definitely ask for the fast track at the airport For departure it is non existent so a total loss of money!!!,Date of stay: April 2018,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/belindaf825
Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,minotaur1975 wrote a review Apr 2018,30,Nice hotel. Could be so much better,Am writing this while still here and it's fresh and am trying to be as fair as possible:    The Good  - amazing kids club - the staff deserve a special mention  - Rooms are nice and spacious. We booked an Atlas view suite which is worth it for that amazing view  - Nice pools and beautiful hotel throughout  - Staff are nice and well intentioned  - Impressive breakfast selection (though found ants swarming in the cereal this morning and had to point this out)    The Bad  - Definitely the food options. The options are very limited and not varied enough. There are a lot of rules of what you can order and when and when you have young kids this can be troublesome. Today we just discovered that children under 5 eat for free and there is a special secret menu that you can order from. This hasn't been offered to us in the first three days and we can have paying about 30 euros for a burger for the kids to split  - Pricing of food. Its very expensive for the quality and portions. We did have the sunday brunch which was over 100 euros per head with no alcohol included. You get the picture.  - Quality of service. It's very patchy. You need to follow up with understanding as you may get the wrong thing. and sorry to go on about the food again but check your bills....a few incidents of over charging...charging for things that never arrived and we cancelled etc.    So...I have threatened to write a trip advisor review for a while but by the time I get home...I have had a good time overall and feel guilty to write a slightly bad review...but am writing this one in the hope that the management listen and make the changes to make this hotel great and a proper five star hotel (not just in pricing). I would like to return when/if they resolve these as it seems to be a common thread across other reviews.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,minos1975,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/minos1975

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Glenn G wrote a review Mar 2018,50,Oasis with golf course,We traveled to Morocco for the first time on the 10th of February 2018 and stayed a week at the Fairmont Royal Palms. An excellent hotel with a sincerely friendly staff.  The first thing that really hit home after appreciating the beauty and spaciousness of the place and of our suite was the absolute stillness and silence of sitting on our balcony. Almost shocking a world without planes cars and trains.  Our room was large very clean a well-situated wardrobe. Wi-Fi in the room was spotty; sometimes there more often not.  We enjoyed the well-manicured golf course. Challenging and spectacularly beautiful with the blue Atlas Mountains in the background no matter where you looked. We were always well taken care of in the pro-shop and restaurant. They made us feel very welcome.  We only ate at the international restaurant. Breakfast very good with friendly agreeable service. The breakfast offered the best “Moroccan Ginger Snaps” that I have ever tried!  We had dinner there twice. Terrific Saffron Risotto. As mentioned we were there at the beginning of February and the restaurant in the early morning and evening was very very cold. Uncomfortably cold.  The heart of the Hotel was the Concierge Desk. All the people behind the desk were exceedingly helpful. No request was too challenging. When we said goodbye I felt like we were leaving behind friends.  We are looking forward to next February to return. It was a very good experience.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Meerbusch, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/780glenng
Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Oli W wrote a review Mar 2018,40,Fantastic property but needs some changes,This is a beautiful property set in stunning grounds with superb rooms and facilities. It is absolutely five star and our junior suite with both shaded and sunny outside areas was spectacular. The walk in wardrobe and bathroom was so expansive and indulgent. There are lovely touches such as free minibars and macaroons/ biscuits left every day. The indoor pool at the spa was stunning and the grounds are so big that however busy the hotel a quiet area to sunbathe can easily be found.    The service still needs refining since Fairmont have taken it over with staff who don't always understand the expectations of guests and all too often cannot return a call or answer a query. The infrastructure needs to be resolved too - unreliable wifi and the odd power cut for example. All these things will be resolved in time however I'm sure.    There are a lot of rules in place which seem unnecessary. An extortionately priced buffet breakfast with no a la carte option was one example though compromise was found on it after a discussion. And this is the only hotel I have ever been to which refuses to serve food by the pool on your sunlounger and insists you go to the restaurant. Both restaurants for dinner (one of which was excellent and one of which was especially poor) are formal and there is no option beyond room service for anything more simple. For lunches the golf clubhouse was a lighter option but we didn't discover this until our penultimate day.    Overall we enjoyed our stay mainly because the property is beautiful and we had lovely weather. However the service issues needs to be improved for this to reach the standards you'd expect of a Fairmont. I know the management which has been put in place reletively recently will achieve this and the restaurant offer plus wifi connectivity should be their priorities.,Date of stay: February 2018,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/900oliw

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Mulligan108 wrote a review Feb 2018,50,Tremendous Hotel Experience,I have been fortunate to have stayed at a number of excellent hotels in different parts of the world. This is one of my favourites. The property is exquisite with tranquil pools surrounded by walking areas and beautifully maintained gardens. The staff are uniformly friendly and always prepared to assist with any question or concern. The world class golf course is a five minute walk. Its fairways are impeccable and the Atlas Mountains make a visually stunning backdrop. The restaurant service is informed and attentive. I recommend the room service for breakfast for quality and value and the service - especially by Mohcine - is impeccable. Nespresso in the room satisfies the caffeine requirements in style. If you wish to visit Marrakesh it can be accomplished with the free shuttles but you should consider staying in the city for a couple of nights and then escaping to the tranquility of Royal Palm.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,JeffreyHanley wrote a review Jan 2018,30,"An excellent staff, but smoking killed the place",The staff were truly wonderful helping us book a trip into the Atlas Mountains explaining what to see downtown and making us specialty drinks night after night. The hotel is located outside of town strongly recommend organizing transport to the hotel in advance or you will be taken advantage of by a taxi even official ones and even if you speak French or Arabic.    The rooms are huge decadent and turn down service is pretty sweet. The entire property is a massive garden looking out onto the Atlas Mountains.    This place is set to be a very nice Fairmont but the smoking just kills the atmosphere. Smoking outside ok it's not Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise but smoking inside the hotel? Inside the restaurants? Inside ALL the restaurants? We became relegated to room service. Even if it is Morocco this is still a Fairmont and even Sub-Saharan Africa has largely banned smoking indoors. It's not fair to the staff or guests to work and dine in that kind of environment.    Staff were wonderful but there was some confusion on check-in as we were 'two guys' sharing room.... shouldn't we have two rooms? Did we make a mistake with the reservation? The staff ended up being fine with it but a note to LGBT travelers to be careful.    We expect the best with Fairmont and this just fell short.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,by OSQUARE wrote a review Dec 2017,50,A true paradise,The last couple of days we were staying at Fairmont Royal Palm a resort that we visited last year too. And oh it was so amazing! Our suite had the best view since we were overlooking the Atlas Mountains and it was just insane to wake up to. If you are early the sun rises from behind the mountains and it’s such a magical view.. That’s why we had to have our breakfast in the room since there is nothing better than a great breakfast with some sun and a incredible view right? It was one of that moments that already have turned into memories.    Fairmont Royal Palm is an exclusie retreat offering genuine hospitality developed in harmony with the surrounding environment. It is nestled in a natural landscape of 231 hectares (!!!) of palms olive and orange trees. You can feel the nature around you the whole time and it’s just impossible to describe. Not only the surrounding impressed us also the spa is absolutely worth mentioning. It’s such a beautiful light and calm area. It’s just perfect for a relaxing afternoon. We went there to relax however it was even more beautiful than in our memories so we end up taking tons of pictures there. After our little photo session we both had the signature treatment which was an amazing massage with a – great smelling – oil made of fresh oranges. Could it get any better than that? We absolutely loved the massage and recommend that to everyone. It really will make your stay even more amazing.    Since the resort is 12 km from Marrakech we decided to stay in and have our dinner at the international restaurant Le Caravane and oh that was really really great! They have a great menu with a lot of choices. We think it’s really important hotels serve high quality and yummy food when the city is a while away and Fairmont for sure does.    If you ask us. Fairmont Royal Palm is a perfect getaway when visiting Morocco. It is such a quite place perfect to relax and still really close to the busy and hectic city of Marrakech.,Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"The Hague, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/byOSQUARE

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,pamelasgold wrote a review Dec 2017,50,"Peaceful, beautiful property!",We stayed here for my boyfriend's birthday which we booked through Wedaways (the best romantic travel company with specialists in all areas of the world).    Serene quiet beautiful peaceful luxurious unpretentious. These are some words that come to mind about this fantastic new Fairmont hotel. Marrakech is a beautiful and desirable destination but if you want to get out of the hustle and bustle of the city to a quiet place (with a fantastic golf course!) this is your place. There are shuttles multiple times a day to the new and old city so no worries about taking a cab! They're also quite flexible on pick up/drop offs if there aren't many other guests. The shuttle is also quite beautiful - a very comfortable Mercedes with hardwood floors!    The room: spacious with high ceilings seriously one of the most comfortable massive beds ever gorgeous terrace views and great Nespresso machine. HUGE bathroom with double sinks a gorgeous bath and great water pressure in the shower and awesome lighting for make-up! The decor was tasteful with red accents---really beautiful! We had a massive terrace overlooking the golf course. It was private peaceful and such a nice tough.    The food: YUMMMM. The first night we arrived we decided to take a walk from our room to the restaurant (about 10 minutes beautiful surroundings). We dined at the international restaurant at a private table which was SO romantic. After a few nights in Morocco you're ready to eat something other than tagine! The food was fantastic. Seriously one of the best meals. We ordered the tastiest risotto stuffed chicken breast steak and appetizer. We tried the cocktails - strong and delicious. I cannot rave enough about the cuisine here! The breakfast was also fabulous. A huge selection of breads cheeses salads pastries fruit and hot food as well as an omelette bar. Tasty coffee as well. Beautiful views from the restaurant. All of our servers were super friendly and eager to please.    The grounds: beauty is not a word that does this property justice. It is a true oasis. Sprawling beautiful views amazing pools pristine buildings and luxurious interiors. We love love love the property. If you're not keen on walking to your room from the main lobby building or the fantastic huge spa or gym there are drivers with golf carts available 24/7 and you never have to wait.    The golf: My boyfriend did a day of golf and absolutely loved it. When we travel and golf is in an option in the destination he always partakes. He raved about this course and even said it was a bit challenging (in the best way!). We took a walk around the course because the views are stellar. Even if you don't golf get a hold of a golf cart and take a drive around so so beautiful!    This is an A+++ property in Marrakech. If you're not into staying in the center of the old city I highly recommend this property! If you love golf then this is a no-brainer!,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Los Angeles, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pamelasgold

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,LG1031 wrote a review Nov 2017,50,Merci Beaucoup - “Royal” Holiday,For seven days in mid October my daughter and I enjoyed an amazing time in this 5*resort. We stayed in a two bedroom villa that fulfilled certain personal accommodation wish lists. Ive never looked forward to outdoor dining like I did on this stay - my daily coffee overlooking lush gardens the pool and a free standing hammam! Who needs a playlist when the birds are out on point with their tunes!    The resort is an 'oasis' - as far away from the chaos of the city as one looking for relief can hope for. As no vehicles are allowed on the grounds (except electric golf carts) the short walk to and from the main buildings restaurants and facilities among olive trees and date palm trees was a pleasant 'walk in the park'. Everything about this resort is first class: from the excellent facilities (sports centre spa kids centre)to the restaurants - but most impressive of them all is the welcoming and attentive staff. Everyone we encountered from everywhere in the property were so friendly and eager to assist: in your choice of English French or Arabic. We dined in all the 5 excellent restaurants but I thought the lounge/restaurant at the new elegant clubhouse (to a stunning 18-hole course) was my favourite. Only because of the awesome view of the golf course and the Atlas mountains in the distance over my cocktail glass.    This resort may be a 20 minute drive from the city centre of Marrakech but the overall appeal of tranquil and beautiful surroundings at the end of a gruelling sightseeing day is just irresistible. On those days when we wanted to explore the Jemaa El Fna and the souqs there was the convenient hourly Mercedes shuttle bus. It was a 'sad' day when we checked out but happy memories and a rejuvenated energy lingers to this moment. Its amazing how the right choice of accommodation can happily impact the rest of the winter months!,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Edmonton, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LG1031

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Vesna F wrote a review Oct 2017,50,One of the most romantic places on Earth,If you are writing your travel bucket list like places you need to see in your life I suggest you to put this hotel among the top 5. Fairmont Royal Palm has 230 hectares property all covered in greenery- palms olives flowers and unbelievable golf course with lake. Some may think this place is only for golfers but it is for everyone especially for couples. Here you will experience real romantic nights because at night Royal Palm is so beautifully lit that is simply magical. I suggest to spend nights in the hotel and just enjoy in long walks inside the property.  All rooms has spectacular views and terraces. The rooms are very big. For example deluxe room is 72sqm more than many junior suites.    When you wake up and you want to go to have a breakfast you may call the reception to send golf cart to pick you up. On the way you will enjoy beautiful scenery and soft wind breeze. Le Caravane restaurant has magnificent terrace that overlooks the Atlas mountains. Food is exceptional the chef that works here spent years in Paris working in hotels like de Crillon and Plaza Atheene.    During the day you may enjoy swimming in outside or inside pools. The gym is very well equipped and there are also tennis courts. Spa is by Clarins so it's guarantied regal experience.,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Belgrade, null, Serbia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/787vesnaf
Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,JetSetterBrian wrote a review Sep 2017,50,Outstanding!,Checkin: This process was seamless and staff were very friendly and accommodating. The grounds are very nice here. Everything overlooks the golf course.    The Villa: We rented a 2 bedroom villa here and it was everything I hoped for and more. It exceeded my expectations. The villa was very high end with granite and crown molding everywhere. The bedrooms were large with very comfortable plush beds. The bathrooms were massive and included an outdoor shower area as well. The pool was heated and good size for swimming laps. There was also a hamam in the back yard which we used daily.    Food: Breakfast every morning was great. There was a huge selection of Turkish food as well as meats breads pastries and juices. Everything overlooked the golf course.    All in all this property is fantastic. It is a little out of the way if you want to go into town. We stayed here for 4 days and had no reason tho leave. We stayed in the city for an additional 4 days after staying here is why. If you stay in the villas it is a 10-15 min walk to the main lobby. You do have the option of calling for a buggy to pick you up and they usually got there pretty fast. The walk was nice every morning if you don't mind a little bit of exercise. Staff were very friendly and professional. We will definitely come back to this property.,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Los Angeles, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JetSetterBrian

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Nihal Zahwi wrote a review Sep 2017,20,Nice room n landscape but too many BUTs,The hotel has very large rooms and beautiful landscape but 1) too far and this is by itself is not the issue. The issue is they don't have taxis on site and Marakech taxis are not allowed to go there so you end up waiting 30 min each way to get a taxi and pay 50$ each time you go Medina 2) rooms not well maintained- u have lots of wood inside the room that s very dusty. I didn't want to put my clothes in the open dressing bcos of dust; 3) i didn't have hot water in my shower! It is hot for 30 sec n turns cold again. I complained but nothg was fixed; 4) food at hotel is mediocre and v expensive 5) i had by far the worst check-out. The guy should not be working in such hotel. It lasted 35 min he printed the bill on old paper with typing on it and had to redo it he spent 10 min to figure out how to split the bill! They charge soo much and doesn't seem they hire the best caliber in town.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Jaouad S wrote a review Sep 2017,50,A true Resort in the city of Marrakech,I had the pleasure of lodging at this beautiful hotel during PURE exhibition earlier this month and i must say it is by far THE BEST Hotel in Marrakech (12km away from the city center or 17 min to be exact to the square JAMAA EL FANAA) and 15 min from Marrakech Airport. So if you want to enjoy a relaxing and an enjoyable stay than this is your place the property is in excellent condition all the rooms they have balconies with Atlas mountain and golf course views and the best thing is that the smallest room they have is 78 sqm. The hotel is definitely a go to for golfers since they have an 18 hole golf course with a state of the art club house and if you are travelling as family with kids than this is by far the best option cause they have the best kids club in terms of space (more than 1000 sqm) with different activities for the kidos and the best part it's open till 23:00pm so you certainly can enjoy your time being it golf Spa or a quite dinner with your loved one or if you want to go cruising in the city in peace. And i would add that the quality of air there is sensational and refreshing for sure so i would highly recommend this hotel to families couples real city break from all the hassle of work or stress! Unless you want to be exactly in the middle of the Medina than this is not for you otherwise this is a place where you can enjoy a true sense of vacation and offers various dining option aside from the Jazz bar.,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaouadS

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Adriano R wrote a review Sep 2017,10,Service sub-par for a property that could be much better,"I stayed in the hotel for 4 nights and was expecting a much better service than I actually got. First I booked my airport to hotel transfer with the hotel (that cost me 60€ each way!!!) and after arriving there was no-one waiting for me outside the terminal (which is always nice when it´s 40º outside). After two calls the person responsible for the transfer finally showed up and when I asked where he was he just lied to my face saying he was right outside. After arriving at the hotel I had explicitly informed the hotel by e-mail I wanted my Junior Suite with two beds only to find the suite had a queen bed only after being assured at the reception the room was like I asked for.  The mini-bar on the room despite being ""free"" only had a few Cokes waters and juices and when I arrived all the contents were warm as they haven´t even closed properly the fridge. There was also nothing to eat not even some cheap piece of fruit.  Room service had a very limited menu available and keep in mind you will never wait less than 45 minutes to have anything to eat not to mention the outrageous prices they charge you for mediocre food (35€ for a club sandwich 30€ for a hamburger etc).  Now where it gets interesting is on the hotel infrastructures where they definitely have a good product but is terribly operated for instance the main swimming pool which is the holy grail of the hotel close at 6pm!!! and apparently it makes sense for them...If you want to hit the gym despite being located on it´s own building you have to go from 7am until 9 pm because they could not be bothered ta have it open for 24 hours. The service personnel does not speak english at all and when they try it is a horror show.  The turndown service was the worst I´ve ever seen in my life first someone would come and change the towels but would not ask if we wanted to have our beds open or the blinds closed then 30 min later someone would come by to change the coffee mugs (no idea why it could not be made at the same time) but would not refill the fridge at all despite being free...  I could go on and on but to sum up my experience I would not recommend this property specially when you are paying 400€ a night for mediocre service.",Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,Angra do Heroismo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adrianor266
Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,JIVITW wrote a review Sep 2017,50,Stunning!,The long drive up to hotel creates suspense. Having seen photos of the hotel and read mixed reviews we were a bit sceptical. However upon arriving into the hotel foyer you pause and the view hits you. They have an extremely large window with a view of palm trees and mountains in the background. Rather than talking to the receptionist you instantly want to look at the view. It truly is exceptional.    Our room was fantastic large and spacious. We had an amazing view and to open the curtains in the morning gave us goosebumps. The mini bar was free and you can help yourself when needed.    The food was amazing. However it is extremely pricey. Do not stay here if you are on a tight budget. I'd recommend the half board option for sure and if there is a full board do go for that.

What impressed us most was that employees had a smile on their face whenever we crossed one.    Food quality is very good both dinner and breakfast. Yes the extra costs are high nevertheless water sodas and coffee are for free in your hotel room.    You need to consider that this is a resort hotel. I would not recommend it as a base to explore Marrakech as the hotel is about 20-25 minutes away from the Medina and the transfer prices are quite elevated (250dh each way).

We weren't disappointed at all. The rooms are in small blocks and well spaced with lovely furnishings. The grounds of the hotel are lovely and the main pool is huge with lots of seating areas. Also at lunch the pool restaurant serves great food and you can cool down under huge umbrellas while in the evening this restaurant was used for buffets and traditional Moroccan entertainment.  All of the staff we interacted with were very friendly spoke good English and very helpful. We visited during Ramadan but this wasn't a problem in terms of food and drinks (not like the issues we had in Dubai at this time) and as the temperatures were starting to rise the number of guests in the hotel was low.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Birdsfoot wrote a review Jun 2017,10,"Worst ""Leading hotel of the world."" I have been to.","Marrakesh is a beautiful town. Really enjoyed the sight seeing. Highly recommended to come for around five days.    The hotel is beautiful. Nice big grounds. Nice massive excellently furnished and decorated rooms. The staff are wonderful and can't do enough for you. Spa is beautiful and good Clarins treatments. Children's Play area is one of the best I have come across. That's it. It stops here.    Had lots of service issues at the hotel which I can go on and on.... let me make it absolutely clear that the staff have been wonderful. I think the biggest problem is communication and staff training.    Hotel is too far out from everywhere and everything. Not a single Resturant or Cafe nearby. It's is extremely expensive to get hotel cars or outside taxi to take you to and from this hotel anywhere. Roughly £20 each way. The food at the hotel is not cheap. Everything is over priced. Please take time to read other reviews and you will see what I mean. Drinks food and snacks are overpriced.    Communication is the biggest issue here. Half the staff don't speak English or the level of understanding is very very poor. When asked all you get back is ""no English"". Hence if you don't speak Arabic or French don't even bother going coming to this property.    The request for special dietary requirements is ignored. There is absolutely no concept of Vegetarian Vegan Gluten Free etc here. It took them five days to sort out egg free vegetarian breakfast. When you ask them to prepare anything outside the menu the straight answer is NO!! First leading hotel of the world who can't cater for special dietary needs.    We emailed the hotel with our catering requirements a week before travel and got no response back. When arrived at the hotel we again spoke to reception. We also gave time and asked if we could order things early in the day for dinner so chef had a chance to organise and cook. We were informed the chef doesn't have time to talk now. Just come for dinner and he will cater anything. The Resturant is International but when asked to cook international the answer is NO!!    We were informed the Bar has Japanese Sushi Resturant. When visiting the Bar we were informed the Sushi Resturant is shut because of fasting period.    We were told at breakfast there is a moroccon Resturant on first floor. When arrived to have dinner we were told it's shut.    The pool side Resturant caters for people who were fasting. Not everyone is allowed. ( informed by Bar )    Hence in the whole Hotel there is only one Resturant Operational....    The swimming pools on the first two days were freezing cold. We were told the gym pool is heated and when going there the man said all heating is shut because of the hot weather.    The hotel is beautiful. The staff we interacted with were helpful and amazing. Always smiling ( considering they were all fasting in this hot weather ).    I would not come back to this hotel. It's expensive ( for no good reason! If you are expensive then at least be 100% on service ) lacks service.  Really need to up their communications and training between different departments. It was clear that each department ran independently and didn't even know what other was doing. There are hundreds of more positively rated properties near town. Stay there.    Did ask to speak to the general manager and was informed he is not available. I was assured he will be informed of my concerns. Let's see if he bothers to get in touch. Had a chat with guest relations lady. She was very pleasant and apologetic.    I really just go to the leading hotels of the world website and book a hotel. This is a mistake I made. I should have looked at the consistent reviews on trip advisor before booking. Don't still understand how this property is still a member of that group?    I wish all the best to the hotel. Hope they can sort all these issues out for their own good.  This review is just for people who expect a certain level of service  can't speak or understand French and require a special dietary needs to be aware of. Especially when there is nothing in the vicinity of the hotel.",Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Birdsfoot
Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,PeterBColchester wrote a review Apr 2017,40,"Could be great...but they haven't quite ""got it""!","This has all the makings of being a lovely hotel if only they could sharpen up the service and just get things right first time.  We arrived at night and check in was easy and slick. A golf buggy took us to our rooms. We had a luxury family suite comprising two beautiful rooms with a sitting room in between - the rooms were stunning; huge fabulously well appointed with dressing rooms huge bathrooms terraces. Really very impressive.  We ordered room service as we were so late and whilst it took a long time to arrive (best part of an hour) it was very good...but then we saw the cost at about £200 for chicken nuggets club sandwich two croque monsieurs and a cheap bottle of wine. And so the tone was set for the holiday - top notch prices but not with the service standards to match.  The next morning we had a proper look around. The resort is beautifully maintained with a great health club with clay tennis courts a squash court gym and dance studio and lap pool - we used that a lot and it was excellent.  Breakfast was a let down - paying these prices you would expect a first class breakfast but I've had better in a three star. It's a small buffet an egg station and patisseries - pretty standard and nothing special.  Lunch every day we took at the poolside restaurant L'Olivier. Lovely setting and the food was nice but service was often chaotic and slow. Asking for things two or three times became a running joke - maybe we're a bit fidgety as a family but we don't like just sitting around and with three children aged 17 15 and 10 we needed prompt service and reasonably rapid food; which we very rarely received. This restaurant seemed geared up for older French couples who would happily spend two hours over lunch and didn't seem to be able to manage a family wanting to eat lunch within an hour.  The pool was spectacular- very clean and fresh (probably no more than 23-24 degrees but tolerable). Towels and sun loungers were in scant supply - particularly after lunch; no pool attendants seemed to undertake any tidying up during the day so if you decided to go for a swim late afternoon there were no sun loungers free- most had used towels on them and we had no way of knowing if they were still in use or not. Not what you'd expect in a 5 star resort. Getting a drink poolside represented similar challenges - I would often have to go walkabout until I could track someone down willing to bring me a drink (which were ruinously expensive - think £10 for a coke).  The staff everywhere were friendly - it certainly helped to be able to speak french as this is very much a french hotel.  My impression was that the hotel just needs organisational oversight - the systems and communication just don't seem to work as they should. The staff were willing but easily confused or forgetful - towards the end of our week we were getting quite frustrated with getting things done.  Finally the golf course....the club house is still under construction so there is a temporary club house with virtually no facilities - but that doesn't stop the charging juggernaught which rumbles on regardless. I played a round of golf with my son on one day and then a second round with my son and my wife on another day. On both occasions we had two buggies and used hire clubs (very much second hand affairs - nothing special). Other than a bottle of water each there are no frills - no half way house no drinks buggy no sat nav course planner - and yet they managed to charge a grand total of about £500 for the two rounds of golf (£50 a round each plus £40 buggy hire plus £40 club hire each). We only found these prices out when we checked out and when we queried them we were told that we had ""signed a completed cost form"" - which of course we hadn't; we were asked to sign a blank sheet confirming our room number and name and they then completed the costs afterwards. I admit I didn't ask the price and to be honest if there had been the usual ""bells and whistles"" that you often receive at 5 star golf resorts then I probably wouldn't have minded too much; you expect to pay over the odds. This felt like daylight robbery though and I didn't appreciate being told that I had signed a completed form when they clearly must have known that was not the case.  The course itself was excellent - but like the rest of this hotel it needs to provide the extras and first class service if it is to justify its already first class prices.",Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,Colchester,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeterBColchester
Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Ashlee K wrote a review Apr 2017,30,A pleasant interlude,For most of the staff the native language is Arabic but French is widely spoken. However the level of understanding of the latter varies considerably so just because the member of staff smiles and nods you can't be sure you have been understood. We would have struggled had we not spoken French. The weather was good at the beginning of April with temperatures around thirty so the beautiful pool was much appreciated. Those staying the previous week had suffered several days of rain which meant that the impressive mountain backdrop was clearly visible when we arrived but within two days had disappeared in the heat haze. The luck of the draw!  Our room was clean and of a high standard with a comfortable bed but a lighting system I couldn't master. You never knew when staff were coming to make the bed or tidy up so we were often caught out by someone knocking when we were in the shower or getting changed and it seemed a different person every time.  A major negative was the lack of a folder in the room with basic information such as restaurants and their opening times spa and sports amenities etc. It was four days before we found out by chance that there was a free shuttle bus (navette) to Marrakech several times a day.  We were on a bed and breakfast basis and found the restaurant prices quite steep. Our meal in a Marrakech restaurant was a third of the price and the discovery of a Carrefour supermarket in the city was the icing on the cake. The buffet breakfast had a wide selection of pastries and hot food but lacked soft fruit such as raspberries. It was pleasing that the manager brought me walnuts the day after I had asked why there were none.  One of our pleasures on holiday is to relax with a movie before bed but at this hotel you cannot hire a film so you can only watch the single film that happens to be on the TV and to cap it all the volume on the English channel was significantly lower than on the others so any one with a hearing loss would have a problem.  The spacious Kids club looked amazing and included the current 'must have' IT gadgets.  The sports centre was equally impressive and there we met a member of staff who went that little bit further. My daughter had wanted to use a punch bag but was told that it was on order and not expected for several weeks. The centre manager passed her request to another member of staff (Simon?) who brought in his own punch bag and gave my daughter a work-out that was exhausting to watch and good boxing training for her. Now that's what I call service.  On our final night we booked a table for a celebratory dinner and specifically asked to be on the terrace. When we arrived at eight thirty there was no table so they speedily set up one in the walkway! As this was unacceptable to us it was suggested we go to the bar and wait. We bought our own drinks and sat for forty minutes before a table was free. We then ordered our meal only to be told that it was too late to order that particular meal. At that point I almost got up and walked out. Not the nice evening we had hoped for.  This review has many negatives but the room the pool the location and the weather all combined to give us some happy memories and the staff were all very friendly.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AshleeK_11

How ever Aziz the front of house manager went above and beyond to assist us.  Whilst we waited for our rooms he invited us to have a complimentary lunch and drinks.  He ensured our rooms were together and with a pool view.  He was also very helpful with finding us a driver to take us out as needed.  The hotel is comfortable and the staff friendly and polite. It's important to them that their guests enjoy their stay.    I recommend the hotel but to UK visitors if you do not speak French or Arabic it is a challenge.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Jswar wrote a review Mar 2017,20,Expensive and disappointing unless you play golf,"First the positives. We have a nice room comfy bed excellent bathroom and the breakfast is lovely. The negatives. Every pool whilst beautiful and allegedly heated is freezing. You would have expected the staff to notice that hardly anyone gets in the water!! If they do they jump out pretty fast!  The prices are extraordinary. For example a club sandwich is £28 a small burger £23 and a can of coke £7.50. A basic facial in the spa is £150. My husband is happy with the golf. The course is apparently nice and certainly most of the guests seem to be here for the golf facilities.    You are also somewhat captive at the hotel which is about 10km from the town (unless you want to use the free shuttle bus) as a taxi round trip costs about £42. The last bus is at 5pm so not suitable for an evening meal out. Negotiating with taxi drivers prepared to take you out of town is stressful and the majority of the ""little taxis"" available cannot take you outside of the city.  The hotel staff assure me that Marrakesh prices are ""just like London and Paris"". As someone who works in London I am quite clear this is not the case! Tourists expect to pay more than locals but the uplift in prices is extraordinary and not matched by the location.",Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sawbridgeworth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jswar

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Catherine K wrote a review Mar 2017,50,Luxury resort with a nice golf course,We stayed here for my birthday celebration and liked it. The room is big enough - especially the bathroom is big with a nice sized dressing room.    The golf course has a beautiful Atlas mountain view. The town is quite far away - 25 min - although the resort runs a free shuttle bus and the driver was very kind and friendly. So if you are more active town traveler rather than a nature lover/golfer maybe it is not an optimal choice.    We had no chance to have a meal at the hotel because we ended up dining out in the town after a massage every night which was a shame but wanted to try a couple of famous restaurants in town. My birthday breakfast was delivered on our balcony with the atlas mountain view - we ordered it and my partner requested a b-day treat so two waiters brought a really delicious b-day cake with a surprise. From the experience I can tell you the food might be quite good - all of the room service food was good.    View is really beautiful. Lots of people are french there and the staffs assume that we are french and started to talk to us in French.

We checked into the Royal Palm on the Saturday at around noon as my friend had booked the whole hotel for his 280 guests for 15 days. The orginisation was amazing as we arrived in at least 10 mini buses. A beautiful drive until one reaches the main building to this stunning Hotel and resort. The reception was friendly and professional. We were shuttled to our rooms which was away from the main building but that was no problem as the shuttles were availabe to the guests beck and call. Our room was amazing spacious beautiful interior and every room has a balcony. Most of us had lunch at the pool Area and although the staff had too deal with so many people at once they always remained calm and friendy. There was a huge Buffets lambs on the Spit startes and mains and desserts spread over 3 Areas for the party that night for all his guests and the garden was beautifully lit. Food was amazing and the staff great. The next morning we had breakfast on one of the terraces which was the best French breakfast I ever had. Fresh juices food from healthy to salty. We relaxed at the pool after that. We were picked up by Busses in the afternoon which brought us to the Airport. Am amazing hotel with great staff.

Everything from the superb pick up at the airport was absolutely perfect.  Room very spacious SPA superb breakfast absolutely fantastic as well as the two restaurants.  One is more formal with a little bit of dress code and the other more casual... funny concept about the barbecue...which is served on your table and then you have to cook it yourself.... we did like the idea very much.  SPA treatments were fantastic.  they have two pool...one giant in front of the restaurants... another one...more discreet and lovely behind the gym SPA.... to finish with a huge golf course.  what did disappoint us was that we did order a tour guide via the concierge...  the guide was of course knowledge but  as it happens in many other European cities he took us to visit the shops that he knows...where everybody was trying to sell us something... I mean..do you really need to be that shameless? we couldn't wait to leave and we tried to explain that we were not interesting in buying  but nothing.... after 50 meters we had to stop and look at something to buy.  Annoying.  I will of course go back even tomorrow morning but I would avoid to book a guide with the hotel directly and would discover the wonderful Marrakesh by ourselves.

The location is exceptional hotel infrastructure outstanding and services provided are of high quality.

Kudos to Hassan and team  - An excellent kids club we felt our kids were very well looked after and cared for. Thanks to Mehdi and staff.  - Across the board junior and senior staff are friendly attentive eager to please and responsive. We had a health issue with one of our children and we had a doctor in our room within an hour.  - Moroccan restaurant is outstanding in quality service and atmosphere Had it been in London it would be one of our top 5 restaurants. ""Tride"" ""Tangia"" and Jouhara A+ plus a great selection of Moroccan wines. Thanks to Naima and team. Breakfast is also outstanding. We did appreciate the lunch and dinner buffer for kids at la Caravane which is very good as well.  - A+ sports facilities    A few things that could be improved:  - the lunch restaurant l'Olivier has issues in scaling up in busy times we had on two occasions very long wait times. Quality is not up to the standard of the other two restaurants  - our room did not have a favourable exposure to the sun and the view was so so. I suggest that the allocation of room exposure and views be made more transparently for example price room rate according to exposure.

The new Year Eve dinner was a real disaster from what we've been told to what we have seen i can say that i wont return back there especially for special occasions and i can't even recommend it!! .... the versions we have been told on the phone about the dinner and all what it comes with were completely different from what we experienced. They talked about James Bond theme but once arrived no one told us about the program or even welcomed us with drink we were asking them but they were unable to answer our questions not informed properly no welcoming or even someone to talk to they were all busy and running just to get paid even the lady who's responsible for the bar couldn't explain because she didn't know what to say her answers were very very average she couldn't give any useful information there was a big lack of organization and management a lot of staff but no efficiency.... and it's not even this when you call someone to take care of your order no one turns to talk to you or even gives importance to what you say i mean if you're in a 3 star hotel i can understand but when you talk about A PALACE this is unacceptable!!! when we asked the barman for a drink he suggested some and 10 min later he comes to announce that the drink we ordered doesn't exist anymore and when we ordered the James Bond cocktail we were more surprised because that it wasn't the drink my friend is a James Bond Fanatic and he knows everything about that personality and to tell the truth ""the James bond drink"" was a biiiiiiig deception!!!!! after that we had the dinner and it wasn't that exceptional except the singer who gave some ambiance to that night. As a vegetarian the chef wasn't that innovative i had a very very simple risotto which was a big disappointment for a NYE meal and for the price we paid!! even the fireworks haven't last more than 5 min compared with those of the eastern holidays i've even seen a man telling a hostess that you have a big problem because the NYE in such palace is just a real mess and doesn't worth all what people are going to pay too much for something not compared to a Palace  Te new year eve at ROYAL PALM was everything except a dinner of a high quality standard!!

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,OYP-London wrote a review Jan 2017,40,"An amazing place with a lot going for it, but housekeeping lets it down.",We stayed for 5 nights in a suite and our lasting impression of the place is that it is an amazing building in an equally amazing location which provides a brilliant experience. However the place is somewhat let down by the housekeeping service which if they could sort it out would make it a truly unique and faultless experience.    The whole place is immaculate from the main building to the rooms the grounds the golf course etc. Add to that a very charming and helpful staff who make every effort to make you feel special and you are off to a good start.    The suite we stayed in was a suite furnished in beautiful Morrocan wood with a large safe a well-stocked minibar which is free to use a very large and comfortable bed an a great sofa. We also had a large terrace and two bathrooms which though over the top made the whole thing very grand.    We stayed there on a half board package and were really happily surprised that we could eat pretty much anything in either restaurant without incurring any surcharge for any item. Having since moved to a Sofitel in Agadir where the board entitles you to only the very basic stuff I would say that the Royal Palm's half board package is excellent value if you can cope with refined Michelin-style food every day that is. The food in both the Caravan and the Moroccan restaurants was amazing with some dishes being better than others obviously but the chefs can do both traditional and modern food well. There are just occasions where we felt a more conventional touch was needed e.g. when we ordered a chicken lemon tagine we got a deconstructed one which is basically just chicken breast with a sauce. But overall the standards are very high and there is a huge choice.    Breakfast is also one of the best we have had anywhere in the world. Huge variety of pastries and bread (actually the pastries and bread are amazing in this hotel ) fruits meats and freshly cooked eggs omelettes pancakes etc.    There are two things felt let us down and which justify my 4-star rating:    1 - The lunchtime restaurant (Olivier) is VERY expensive for the quality of the food that it serves. Most dishes are around the £20 mark and the food is pretty bland. I had a crab sandwich which did not really taste of crab because it was mixed with egg and tomato. At that price level you expect perfection for a sandwich. Equally the calamari tagliatelle were just plain and rubbery totally uninteresting.    2 - Housekeeping is haphazard. We had a nespresso machine in the room. The pods were replenished but not the cups. So we called reception several times and nothing was done. Similarly the tea provided in the room was not replenished and neither were the glasses despite several calls to housekeeping.    3 - Internet in the room kept cutting out nearly every minute. We had to keep rebooting the box. A guy came round fiddled a few plugs and left without resolving the problem. Luckily eveywhere else the internet is working well but again for such price tag ...    Overall though the experience was very positive. And if you want to go to town there is a free shuttle - all you need to do is book it in advance to ensure you get a seat on it. It can take you either to the old or the new town and it will also bring you back (unless you want to stay late in town in which case you will need to arrange your own transport.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,unimumNorfolk wrote a review Jan 2017,40,Lovely with a few niggles,This was our first week off for five years as the family were at their 'outlaws' this year. We left on the 23rd December and what a treat to only have a flight of about 3.5 hours. Difficult to assess what clothing to take as very warm during the day but very chilly in the evenings.  We were collected from the airport and taken to the hotel. Wow - lovely warm day with a backdrop of snow capped Atlas Mountains. Very smooth check-in and our luggage was taken to our enormous suite. Huge living room and bedroom with two balconies then we saw the bathroom......Sunken square bath wet room shower double basins walk-in wardrobe with seating and huge mirror complete with plugs. Nespresso machine fresh fruit complimentary soft drink mini-bar and a bottle of wine. The mini-bar and coffee are replenished daily.  There was a choice of two restaurants to eat in the evening and an outside restaurant which served only lunch. The bar was lovely if a little dim - all the lighting in the hotel especially in the restaurants is so muted that you almost need a torch to read the menu - the waiter shone his torch so we could read the menus! There are copious numbers of staff members both within the hotel and in the grounds. Tea lights and fire pits were lit outside every evening.  The food in the two restaurants was on the whole very good but I was very pleased we had opted for half board as otherwise it was incredibly expensive. Even just paying for wine/beer/soft drinks in the evening was eye wateringly expensive.  We have read previous reviews concerning the breakfast service and have to agree. The staff lacked leadership and what worked beautifully in the evenings seemed to fall apart at breakfast time. The food choice was excellent but spoilt somewhat by the haphazard service. On our last day we were not able to have any hot breakfast options as although breakfast began at 7 we had to leave for the airport before any hot items appeared and we were there for at least 30 minutes.  The hotel is beautifully kept the housekeeping staff were very efficient and on the whole most staff were very pleasant. The shuttle bus service worked well for us but we were only aware of this when we enquired in reception the best way to get into Marrakech. There is no information in the room about the bus restaurants or anything else.  Not sure we would visit Marrakech again but would certainly try another part of Morocco.,Date of stay: December 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,norfolk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/unimumNorfolk
Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,shonky wrote a review Dec 2016,30,"Sometimes amazing, sometimes Faulty Towers",Before spending Christmas week here I read some reviews which commented on the lack of service at the resort.

The Good  This resort is spectacularly beautiful - huge and spread out very large suites an absolutely massive (and heated) pool gym kids club multiple restaurants - you name it it has it. I played golf one day and had a ball. You will love the rooms large showers gigantic bathtubs everything you could want.  The employees made every effort to make you feel part of their family. Large smiles lots of welcomes and calling you by name. Christmas day was very special with all of the staff putting on an event for the children - free dessert camel rides Santa coming to bring presents.    The Bad  The people who work there are so nice YET there seems to be significant issues in communication - it feels like there needs to be a lot more training better quality over quantity. Some examples:    1. Took 3 requests to get an iron and an ironing board sent to our room.  2. We confirmed their free shuttle to and from Marrakech (around 30 minutes away). When we were dropped off the shuttle driver apologized and told us he could not pick us up. It seems like there was a communication issue between the shuttle driver and the concierge. Unfortunately we were then ripped off by a local taxi driver for a 400 MAD trip to the hotel.  3. Almost every meal one of the staff members dropped plates in the background. It became a running joke.  4. Laundry not being returned on time and when it was one item was damaged.  5. Very very expensive drinks by the pool (EUR7 for a can of coke) and expensive meals in the restaurants. Much better value in the city BUT 30 minutes away.    TLDR - lacks the polish required of a 5 star resort.,Date of stay: December 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shonky

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Lien C wrote a review Nov 2016,10,Overall Lack of service,Before coming to this hotel we have read a lot reviews (mainly negative) but we wanted to give it a chance.  As soon as we entered the hotel area it all looked fantastic. Beautiful hotel stunning views quiet area. And that is about the only positive thing we can tell about this hotel. I feel sorry for the people working there and doing their best but this was the worst 5-star hotel experience we've ever had. I stayed in luxurious hotels all over the world but this I have never seen before. Fruit juice that comes after you already finished your breakfast no hair dryer in the room a lunch where everyone had to wait 1 hour before a very simple salad was served the most dirty glasses I have ever seen at a swimming pool a wrong bill at the check-out...and so on... And we have only stayed there for 4 days! I have the feeling the lack of organisation causes the lack of service. There is so many staff there weren't that much guests and still it all went wrong. I do hope for the staff something is being done about it. It is such a beautiful hotel and only if things change seriously in the future I would maybe consider to go back. If not I go to Amanjena again.,Date of stay: November 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Ghent, Belgium",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lienc405

The bed was very comfortable. I loved the garden shower. The wifi connection was excellent  - food can be a bit pricey but excellent everywhere  - the kids club was the best and most convenient we have ever experienced! (we usually holiday at the club med for their kids club but royal palm brought a whole new level!) everyone was very professional and trustworthy the activities were very good (beautiful wooden toys drawing/painting swimming tennis etc. only a bit of TV in the evening) and the meals very healthy  - the free shuttle going to the city centre several times per day was very convenient and the driver was extremely helpful and extremely nice  Overall we had a beautiful holiday it was the perfect mix of romantic time family time quiet time and city time.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,RishiB235 wrote a review Nov 2016,40,Good but could be better,Decided to stay here after reading the majority of positive reviews. Amazing property but definitely not a 6* experience. Unfortunately service was generally poor.. whether you requested something from the room or at dinner/breakfast.. it generally involved asking repeatedly and some form of wait. We complained on the first day as there was a lot of noise from the guests upstairs but they chose to ignore- Even if they couldn't move us at least acknowledge it.    On a plus the rooms were nice as was the outside pool area. Breakfast was tasty with a good selection.    The main question I ask myself is would I go back.. probably not. It's really the service that needs sorting but there are enough reviews on here suggesting that and they haven't actioned it.. something that could be swiftly resolved if they really wanted to.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RishiB235

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,mindythelion wrote a review Oct 2016,50,Quiet and calm escape from the bustle of Marrakech,We stayed at the Royal Palm Marrakech in October 2016 and were so grateful to have included this hotel on our itinerary!    The resort is just a 20 minute drive from the main medina but staying at Royal Palm feels like you have stepped out of Marrakech and into a Moroccan oasis. It's a new hotel with beautiful facilities in a gorgeous natural setting situated on a 200+ hectare property covered in olive trees with the incredibly magical views of the Atlas Mountains.    It's easy to get into the main city (they offer free shuttle service 2x per day) but Royal Palm is an ideal spot to hang out on the property and take it easy. They have great gym facilities including a squash court pilates studio and a separate pool for swimming laps plus a lovely bright spa in collaboration with Clarins - we tried the signature massage and between the heated massage beds the elegant oils or the gifted masseuse it was a very serene and rejuvenating experience. We never did try the golf course but we could see it from our room and the layout beneath the mountain range looked picturesque.    The restaurants are also worth noting - there are four places to eat and three main restaurants with International Moroccan and Mediterranean cuisine. I can't remember which evenings but performances are held in the Moroccan restaurant and they sounded amazing! (We were in the International restaurant at the time). We also ordered room service one evening and the staff did such a nice job of presenting our in-room meals so that it felt like we were in a five-star restaurant.    Overall it was the perfect place to stay for a few nights to escape the busyness of Marrakech and take in the stillness of the natural Moroccan landscape. Couples groups business travellers and families will all have an enjoyable experience here.,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Vancouver, BC",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mindythelion
Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Handazza wrote a review Oct 2016,30,"Disappointing, could be so much more",This hotel rates itself as 6* so I had high expectations. But the service and attention to detail the beachcomber provided was not what I'd expect from a 4* let alone a 6*. For example it took a phone call and a 90 minute wait for our luggage to arrive to our room. It took multiple phone calls and a 90 minute wait for some toilet paper (we weren't provided with any in the room on arrival). Drinks were charged to our bill which we didn't have. We got charged for additional meals. We had on 2 separate occasions staff moaning to us about their jobs and saying they wanted to leave. We witnessed a staff argument in a restaurant in the middle of the day in front of guests. We were told we could have a late checkout and then they decided we couldn't after all. All of this was with the hotel seemingly half empty so I hate to think how they'd cope if it was full.    The real deal breaker though was when we decided to play golf. Having not played on a course like this before we were unsure of the costs so asked on more than one occasion if golf was included as part of the hotels amenities. We were told it was. However we were presented with a £150 bill on checkout. We obviously queried this and the golf manager come to meet us. Instead of explaining the situation so that we could come to an agreement he was very insulting implied that we tried to con them and shouted at us in front of other guests. He was the most arrogant self righteous rude man I have ever met. During his conversation we discovered that the club also gave us another guests personal clubs to play with!    Such a shame as the hotel is decorated beautifully most staff are very friendly and the pool is lovely. The bed is unbelievably comfortable! The Moroccan people in general I found to be very genuine and welcoming. This place could be something really special but they're a long way from being 6* in my opinion.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Handazza

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Finch48 wrote a review Oct 2016,50,Getting close to paradise,We were fortunate enough to stay in a villa for 11 nights which was without doubt the best we have stayed in anywhere in the world - not that we have experience of too many villas! Nothing was too much trouble for our butler Abdel who was always there when we needed him without being intrusive. The attention to detail throughout the hotel was fabulous the standard of interior and exterior design amazing and the food exceptional. We couldn't fault breakfast lunch or dinner and we enjoyed 2 evenings in their Moroccan restaurant where two Moroccan gentlemen provided unobtrusive but interesting live music. The hotel is about 14 kilometres from Marrakech centre which makes it beautifully quiet. It has a golf course attached so the views from the bar and restaurants are just stunning. Lots of palm trees and olive trees. We didn't leave the hotel once during our stay as we were there for rest and relaxation.    We had only two niggles - one was the lack of hot water which took two days to resolve with far too much prevarication from the hotel and not enough effort to put it right. The second was the lighting at night in our pool and garden area which only worked for five nights. Abdel did a fantastic job with candles and even deployed a couple of standard lamps outside but the lit up palm/olive trees were a sight to behold when they did work.    If you are considering staying in a villa then go for it. Inside there are two bedrooms and two bathrooms a kitchen and a huge lounge with a dining table at one end. Outside there is a glorious heated pool an outdoor shower a garden with two lawns a hammam/steam room with a further shower attached table and chairs and a Moroccan BBQ the correct name of which escapes me.    This is a truly magnificent hotel where service and attention to detail come first. It deserves to be among the Leading Hotels of the World.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Finch48

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,367GarethD wrote a review Sep 2016,30,Nice break but wouldn't go back,Lovely holiday in Marrakesh - a few cons but all in all a nice place to come. We stayed a week but we thought it best to stay for a shorter time....    Pros - fantastic service and very quiet. There are around 4 'blocks' of rooms and it seemed that only the first 2 nearest reception were being used. There were only around 45 people in the hotel apparently. A little sad to see it so quiet but most places we went to also seemed quiet.    Food - lovely quality and great breakfasts. But as explained below rather pricey when you are staying for more than a couple of nights.    Cons - the bar. Only 1 bar where you have to wear formal attire - men trousers. We came back one night not to be let in - even though there was a family in there with 3 young kids who left. Very disappointing they would rather an empty bar - which was practically always empty. Not quite sure who they want to attract in the bar - families?? Business men?? After being told we weren't allowed in we then chose not to use the bar again as we just felt rather unwelcome and awkward so we chose to go out on most nights. They said that we were informed on booking of the formal dress code but we weren't. I suggest they make it really clear to save other guests the embarrassment we had of being publicly turned away - not a nice feeling on holiday! NB both indoor restaurants are also require men to wear trousers.    It also means that when it has those rain showers there are only 2 places to go unless you have trousers on - reception or your room!    Pool - it's a lovely pool with no deep end. Most days there were just a handful of people. It would feel very different if the hotel was busy! There are lots of poolside attendants but would be nice if they offered water or any general treats to create an atmosphere and a warm welcome. Instead you need to buy water which isn't cheap.    Balcony in room - the rooms are large and beautifully done. We had a terrace as were on the ground floor. The furniture could do with a clean! It was quite dusty!    Prices - the food and drinks are very expensive and there's no casual menu for lunch. Prices in Marrakesh are generally high so the hotel was too. However by the end of our week we did crave a casual lunch where you didn't have to pay around £20 for a bowl of very simple instant pasta.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/367GarethD
Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,mpmpmm wrote a review Sep 2016,50,Serene little getaway!,The whole hotel has about 135 suites and villas and is enormous with a golf course. The rooms are modern and the bathroom is huge with a large bathtub. The pool was beautiful and very relaxing to spend the day at. The gym was impressively clean and modern. The property is so large and well-maintained that the the HR manager told us that they have 120 gardeners hired to take care of it!    The food was expensive but very good [i was surprised because i kinda expected it to be like most hotel food - expensive but quite average in quality] but thankfully it was so good that we willingly stayed there all weekend and had some fantastic meals in the meantime :)    The breakfast buffet in the morning was fantastic. They didn't have an overwhelming number of dishes to offer but the quality was very high. The baguettes at the hotel were to die for! I almost felt i was in paris when i put together a freshly baked baguette with some butter some emmental and some very high-quality jambon blanc. They also had delicious salami proscuitto and smoked salmon.    For lunch we sat by the beautiful pool and had a nice burrata with tomato salad and a crab meat club sandwich and [not one but] two desserts. All very tasty. For dinner we went to their fancy restaurant and we had truffle torellini's that were to die for. I was scraping the sauce off of the bottom of the plate and then we share a grilled sea bass that was delicious.    Tourists who want to go sightseeing in Marrakech may find that this hotel is a bit far from the town and medina however it was perfect for us as we were just looking for a relaxing getaway where we could just bum around by a beautiful pool. Overall our stay at this hotel was really a treat and we didn't feel the need to leave the place at all.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mpmpmm
Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Tve2012 wrote a review Jul 2016,50,Great place with very high standard! definitely a leading hotel of the world,The hotel is situated outside of Marrakech on a spacious area with a beautiful golf course in front of the hotel and the mountains in the back (that you can see with clear weather). The rooms are luxurious with perfectly silent airco (love it!) and a great balcony where you can sit outside and enjoy the view. The bathroom and cupboards have lots of space and provide good comfort. Free softdrinks are in the fridge fruit/ cakes are provided daily the bed is very comfortable and large for a tall Dutchman. TV is state of the art although they could have a bit more choice on the international channels (how about Golf channel we were there when the British open took place and couldn't watch any of it). The main area of the hotel is also very well done with a lovely entrance great athmosphere in the evening. Bar is spacious and well done. Breakfast is super quality although not spot on ready at 7:00 for golfers a bit of a nuisance with the heat in July. Staff is very friendly and helpful everywhere but particularly at the gym. Dinner in the main restaurant is perfect we ate there all week and never got bored and always very superb quality and presentation. Good blend of international and some more local dishes. The bar type restaurant is also pleasurable with the exception of the DIY barbeque not very pleasant in the heat with all the smoke. Don't understand the concept. Food is reasonably priced local wine is good other drinks are expensive like coktails and especially a local simple beerbottle (33cl) for 11 Euros (is more than they charge you in the Champs Elysee...). The pool is gigantic and there are plenty of chairs around but not a lot of umbrella's even though it was a relatively quiet time in terms of the number of visitors. The gym is perfect with good workout equipment a squash court olympic pool (no-one there perfect for quietness) adjacent to tennis courts. The airco could be improved a bit to create a cooler work out area but overall very good! You are transported by friendly staff with buggies so no need to walk to your room if it is too hot. The garden is maintained impeccably.  The spa has very good massages and is very well equipped.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Jo wrote a review Jun 2016,50,Second visit...,I reviewed this hotel in full 2 years ago (see “Best hotel in Marrakech - unadulterated luxury”) but I feel compelled to post an update as this experience was even better than the last if that is possible.    My second trip to the Royal Palm occurred in May this year and I was accompanied by my best friend Fay. The aim was to escape from the terrible weather in the UK and luckily for us Morocco was experiencing a heatwave with up to 40 degrees of lovely sunshine daily for four days solid!    This time we stayed in a sensational Senior Suite which at a whopping 126m2 is actually larger than most of the apartments or houses that I have inhabited in London Switzerland or Stockholm during my lifetime.    The service was just as exceptional as before with most if not all of the staff greeting you by name – a very clever and very gratifying way of making you feel welcome very quickly.    The pool. Oh the pool! I dream of this beautiful pool. This is not a hotel where you arise stealthily at 6am in order to reserve your beds with a Union Jack towel. This is a hotel where you are greeted by charming pool staff who move the sun bed to the exact location that you would like it and then proceed to make the bed up with more towels than any person could sensibly get through in a day.    They have recently introduced a new dining concept – a barbecue - at the poolside restaurant L’Olivier. On Sunday nights this is the only dining option available at this restaurant but you have a choice of several types of barbecue and you are able to mix and match if you wish. You start with a salad and some breads and then they bring a small barbecue to your table top where you cook your own fish/ meat/ veg with accompanying marinades. I came across this when I lived in Switzerland where it was known as Charbonnade. The food is excellent and it’s a great experience but make sure that your charbonnade is down-wind from you if possible as otherwise you’ll end up smoking yourselves too.    I adore this hotel.

Moudi Fati and Mohammed especially but everyone from front desk to breakfast staff to pool attendants were so attentive and polite and genuinely cared. The rooms are spacious and they even made a cake for my wife's birthday. The outdoor pool is a treat and for golfers the course is on site and the clubhouse will be developed by next year. For those who love Spas the Clarins Spa is excellent with so many treatments and for there is alo a well equipped gym for those who like to work out.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,emmahoward-smith wrote a review Apr 2016,50,Absolute Paradise!,I visited Royal Palm Marrakech last week and had the most wonderful stay! Marrakech is perfect for short-haul sun which we had decided to make the most of over the Easter break. From start to finish our experience of the hotel was absolutely faultless - from the beautiful interior design and views over the Atlas mountains on arrival at reception to our spacious suite with large terrace (again with incredible views of the mountains golf course and palm trees) delicious cuisine impeccable service and incredible facilities. We particularly enjoyed a traditional Moroccan dinner at Al Ain (complete with singing and dancing) and breakfast is a feast definitely worth getting out of bed for! Lazy days were spent by the enormous swimming pool and we enjoyed long lunches a lovely massage at the Clarins spa as well as a swim sauna and steam that left us feeling truly relaxed. Although I didn't make it to the gym myself my boyfriend was very impressed with the equipment and state of the art tennis facilities. The only thing we didn't experience was the kids club (although we heard fantastic things from fellow guests). Marrakech and the delights of the souks are only a short drive away where we enjoyed exploring the vibrant city well worth at least an afternoon!    We left Royal Palm Marrakech feeling wonderfully relaxed revived and hugely grateful to the fantastic hotel team who made our experience so memorable.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,The Midnight Blue Elephant wrote a review Apr 2016,50,Lovely Marrakech getaway,While I love the business and atmosphere of Marrakech it was wonderful to get away to the countryside for a few nights. I had been to the Royal Palm before when they hosted the opening party for a travel conference and following an amazing night I thought a regular stay would have a hard time living up to expectations. I shouldn't have worried. From the transport there to my transport back to town everything was amazing and smooth. The views of the hotel are simply stunning - I love the surreal mix of snowcapped mountains and palmtrees. Loved the pools - which are of epic proportion - and the grounds in general but my favorite by far was the staff.

Pool huge and never a problem getting a sun bed even over the Easter week. Sports centre also has great clay tennis courts and another pool squash courts and gym.  The rooms as fantastic. Huge and all mod cons.  The only negatives were the hotel is 30 minutes from town centre and the last shuttle is at 5pm meaning they want you to stay and eat in the hotel which is not cheap.  The lunch and bar menus are also a bit restrictive but the food is very good. It would need to be when it's €28 for a burger and chips for example.  Overall a great hotel but if you have kids it won't be cheap to eat.

The site is calm neat green and anywhere you sit you hear the nice sound of water in a zen sort of way and its very soothing when ever you are at one of many pools or at one of the 3 excellent restaurants or at the SPA and at the Gym. The kids have their very one place and taken care of all day long with joy and lots of fun. The golf is a real vision walking or dirving (very silently). The Atlas mountains were in a mist which haded to the mystic vision of it all. We had a lovely suite with a lovely lounge surrounded by two superbe bedrooms with very large beds sofer and armchairs and enormous bathrooms and a very big terrace.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,jantheys wrote a review Jan 2016,50,almost heaven on earth,"My wife and I just spent 9 days and nights at ""Royal Palm Marrakech"" and it was an almost perfect experience. Winters in Marrakech are great we enjoyed blue sky sunshine 8 out of 9 days with mid-day temperatures between 23 and 26°C. Royal Palm is a big development some 10 to 15km southeast of the city of Marrakech with roughly 200 private villa's and a ""leading hotel of the world"" sharing a very nice and well-tended 18-hole golf-course. The hotel's architecture is inspired by traditional Moroccan architecture but the exterior (slightly ""heavy"" in structure and somewhat ""dull"" in color) is unfortunately not as great as the fabulous interior decoration. The Royal Palm is not a small hotel but the warm and colorful interior decoration and the friendly staff create a cozy and at-home ambiance. The hotel's gardens and pools are lovely both the fitness center and Clarins spa are very well-equiped. Of the three restaurants my wife and I preferred ""l'Olivier"" at the main swimming pool for lunch because of its location the food's simplicity with excellent ingredients and the rather clever daily suggestions. The two dinner restaurants are extremely well-designed & decorated the ""international"" restaurant ""La Caravane"" is good but lacks a bit of contemporary creativity and variation while the lovely and very atmospheric Moroccan restaurant ""Al Aïn"" suffers from a chef with a very sweet tooth (ok we know Moroccan cuisine tends to be sweet but here all plates and even sides are sugary even a lovely piece of fish was sweetened with a sugary pear).

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,NatashaHertfordshire wrote a review Nov 2015,40,"So much to love, but also room for improvement",We stayed here for 7 nights towards the end of September. We found lots to love about this hotel but also a few areas for improvement if it is to live up to its promises.    We loved our spacious and very modern room (a palm suite) which was on the ground floor with fabulous views out across the golf course. We spent quite a bit of time in the evenings on our terrace enjoying the peace and quiet - until that is about 4 nights in when the hotel started filling up (it had been half empty when we arrived) and then we found the peace and quiet went very abruptly. Because of the way the hotel is built the noise echoes around so if you find yourself with neighbours who like to shout unfortunately there is no escaping them!    The grounds and swimming pool area of the hotel are immaculately kept and we really enjoyed the days we spent by the pool. There was plenty of space and we found it easy to get sun loungers. However we found the service round the pool to be a little haphazard: some days we found we were constantly asked if we wanted anything and other days we were not asked once! This inconsistency in the service levels was also reflected in other parts of the hotel. For example at breakfast we found the staff were extremely keen to ask us how we were and if we were enjoying our stay but when we requested items (such as cutlery or a glass of orange juice) it was the luck of the draw whether we got it or not!    There are three restaurants in the hotel and we tried all of them. The Moroccan restaurant we found to be just ok (the food seemed rather bland to us) and the food in the main hotel restaurant was quite rich. However we really enjoyed our lunches in the pool-side restaurant and we were sorry that this didn't open in the evening. The food there was often quite simple (plain grilled fish for example) but very tasty and beautifully presented.    We didn't use the spa but we did make full use of the floodlit tennis courts. As there are several of them it was never a problem getting a court and we played tennis nearly every day of our stay.    Overall we really enjoyed our stay here and we would definitely think about returning. However based on our experience this hotel struggles to cope when very busy so we'd probably only think about coming back during the off peak season.,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Hertfordshire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NatashaHertfordshire
Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,familytravel73 wrote a review Nov 2015,30,An average hotel that doesn't deliver on promises,We were very excited about a trip here given that on the website it describes itself as a 6 star hotel. The hotel itself is beautiful and the bedrooms are breathtaking - lots of space an enormous bathroom. This is where the '6 star' experience ended. There are many aspects of the hotel that are not very well thought out - the hotel is 20 minutes away from town and there are only two restaurants for dinner in the hotel - one of which is Morrocan which seems pointless given that if you do go into town on one evening Morrocan would be the most likely choice of cuisine. The other restaurant is a fine dining style menu and very heavy. If you don't want to venture out (this was our 5th trip to Marrakesh) then there is no choice. The breakfast is quite simple - not much choice and what there was - was not in my opinion up to 6 star standards - eggs sitting for long periods on a buffet pancakes that needed to be ordered a day in advance no fresh omelette station etc etc . In addition to this lunch has also not been thought out very well - there is a lovely restaurant by the pool - however the staff are totally disorganised - one lunch took three hours my husbands salmon arrived without any of his sides - 40 minutes before anyone else's again this menu is quite heavy - there is no option for a simple poolside sandwich or salad which many hotels offer these days. The other option at lunch is a buffet which was average and in my opinion seemed to consist of leftover food from the other restaurants the night before.    Reservations reservations reservations this is the main downfall of the hotel you need to reserve your dinner at breakfast your lunch at dinner - I felt like we were being driven mad by reservation staff - yet when we got to dinner most nights there was no one else there! On top of this is the ludicrous deckchair and pool situation on the first day we arrived we were told there were no deck chairs left - and that we would have to sit on towels on the grass - following this the pool guy then reserved our deck chairs every day but we could only sit where he designated because everyone had reserved their specific spots (through him) - even though our seats weren't great there was nothing we could do. The design of the pool isn't great as the far side is next to the grass with a slim area of paving meaning if your deckchair is on the grass you have to get out the pool and walk with wet feet across the grass (and mud) to get to your chair .......    There are no special touches at this hotel such as fruit by the pool sunglass cleaner flavoured water etc etc - it feels like a new hotel that hasn't got itself together    Lastly we also came down ill (as the traveller below mentions) with tummy bugs (there were 5 of us) we had friends (also a group of 5) who were at this hotel and also came down with tummy bugs.    We normally stay at the Four Seasons which is head and shoulders above there Royal Palm.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Fordyber wrote a review Oct 2015,40,Beautiful setting and suite but not enough to bring us back,"Upsides: beautiful setting fabulous rooms friendly staff  Downsides: service levels aren't consistently where they need to be not enough sun loungers    It didn't start too well for us when the lady from reception took us to our room but when she opened the door it had not yet been cleaned. She was slightly confused but dealt with it fine - showed us around a bit and took us to a table for lunch at the poolside restaurant which is a gorgeous setting. We had to chase her after lunch to get into the room and the minibar (with free soft drinks incl most importantly water) was still unstocked. Arrival hiccups aside the room was amazing - garden suite with 2 beds 2 bathrooms the main bathroom with an enormous bath and separate shower wet room and a big dressing room. On the ground floor with a lovely patio area and gorgeous views of the garden. One downside is that there is noise from above inevitable with stone floors I guess.    The pool is great - huge and with a separate shallow end for smaller kids. This is a family friendly hotel but somewhat frustratingly the children (ours are 6 & 4) were told not to jump into the pool from the bridges that cross it. I can see why (health & safety I assume) but frustratingly tempting for them and no other obvious child friendly pool activities to distract them. Don't get me started on the ridiculous sun-lounger reservation system - we arrived at 10 am after breakfast to be told that no these sun loungers were not available they were all reserved (by having towels put out). Particularly irritating when many people then didn't turn up for their ""reserved"" loungers until after lunch. Eventually the pool guys found some for us but not good enough in a hotel of this standard that they don't have enough loungers. It creates the type of behaviour that we all despise but have to then buy into if you want to avoid hanging around looking for a lounger (ie the system is go on your way to breakfast and reserve them yourself). This could be avoided by having more loungers and refusing to allow people to reserve them when they're not actually going to be using them.    Was disappointed by the sports centre as the material mentions a Pilates studio which I had assumed meant they did regular classes but in fact means you can pay for a 1:1 lesson if you want (I didn't). The spa was nice - only used it for the kids to have a massage (they shared a 30 min massage between them) and the guy who did their massage was very accommodating and good with the kids. I did book in for a facial but unfortunately couldn't have it due to illness (more of that below).    The kids club was good although it seemed slightly haphazard in organisation but our two enjoyed going on a few occasions particularly dressing up. They also take them along for early dinner at 7 pm then back to kids club after for some TV until you're ready to pick them up which was great as our two were too exhausted to stay up having dinner with us every night (even after having a mid afternoon nap) - we picked them up on our way back at around 9.30 which worked well all round. Slightly frustratingly we were told originally that the earliest we could book a table was 7.30 but it appears that you can book at 7 making it a bit easier with little ones.    The food in the Caravane restaurant was very good. Service was well-meaning and some of the guys were great but others just hopeless! Not consistent at all. The food is also very rich which meant after 3 nights we were craving simple fare. The Oliver restaurant by the pool serves lighter lunches but with a small menu this gets a little boring come day 3.    The biggest downside from a personal perspective is that we have all been struck by diarrhoea while staying at the Royal Palm and on our penultimate evening I had a very bad case of vomiting and diarrhoea throughout the night. This obviously impacted our enjoyment of our last couple of days. On our last night I still wasn't able to eat anything so my husband asked reception if he could have a room service credit instead of going to the restaurant by himself. Reception said no although a lady from guest relations later rang to say he could - but by that stage (8.15 pm) he had already gone to the kids club buffet with the children.    All in all some way to go on service levels before this lives up to its promises but we won't return to find out.",Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fordyber

So breakfast which was a wonderful a la carte affair is now a buffet!!yes it""s a nice buffet but a buffet never the less and i for one do not see this as a 6 star experience nowin fact it feels more 4 star now.  Another thing is the spaon arrival no welcome drink or cold towel and the same on departureno drink what so eververy very poor and again no where near 6 starthis is the only spar i have ever visited on my travels which has failed to welcome me with a drink..  And now the restaurant La Caravanthe food was below averagethe first night i ordered lamb rack which was closer to mutton than soft tender lambthe second night we ordered chicken only to be told they had no chickenso i ordered fillet of beef again to be informed they had no fillet of beefso i then asked for the lamb rack and yes you guessed it no lamb rack6 star you say eh??..  So i ended up with a piece of entrecôte which could have graced the sole of my shoes as it was beyond tough.  We went a third night and eventually got the spit roast chicken for 2 and wow again the food was awfuldry tough chicken the size of a pigeonso not one good experience in our visits to this restaurantso we ended up having room service 4 out of 7 nights.    Another thing we left our room one evening with the do not disturb sign switched on only to find that the room had been entered and servicedwhich was quite alarming as we could have left our safe open or been in bed asleep.    So yes the groundsthe rooms and golf course are all top notch the other things which all add up to this claiming to be 6 star are way way short of even 5 star.

Dining options except room service involve two choices either the main or Moroccan restaurants we preferred the main restuarant and ate there most nights. Food quality is very good although after a week you do begin to crave something basic. Waiting staff are great really obliging and helpful. Maitre'd could have been at least a little more welcoming. Pool area very nice for relaxing pool is fairly shallow but massive. Shuttle bus into Marrakech is very convenient. Only down side for us was in both weeks we were there two very large corporate groups arrived and pretty much took over the hotel not a massive issue but they could be noisy which entirely spoiled the relaxed ambiance of the place. Overall a great break at a gorgeous hotel made in many ways by the first class staff eg Sarah in Guest Relations Kamal at the Pool and Tati in the Caravane restuarant sorry I can't mention more names but generally great staff who are a credit to the hotel.,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Scotland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HighFive88
Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Houda O wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Best hotel I stayed in,If there is one thing I'll retain from this place (besides its beauty) it's the service level. I have been to many 5-star hotels and what I have noticed in Morocco is the occasional lack of training. For Royal Palm you could see the difference: everyone greets you checks on you etc. All requests to housekeeping were fulfilled promptly the restaurant managers would make sure you're seated and waiters would regularly check everything is ok. Now this is standard in some other countries but I've never experienced it to this level in Morocco.  Food was amazing. I rarely enjoy the full menu of a place there is always something off but again here everything I tried was exquisite: you could taste butter in the pastries salmon would be cooked just right desserts would be sweet enough but not too much.  This place is blessed with great scenery and the level of details in the architecture is awe inspiring.  The pool was the perfect temperature with an amazing horizon to look at.  Only downside I could think of might be that it's far from the city but honestly I didn't even feel the need to leave the resort.  Definitely recommend this place if you want to destress and could be a romantic getaway.

On arrival we were taken on a mini tour of the hotel and then escorted to our suite where the check in was carried out.    The surroundings and gardens are spectacular food is outstanding and the gym and spa are incredible.    The golf course is suburb and the club supply the golf clubs free of charge and the cost of a round is approx £35 each and golf buggy hire £23.    You have a daily stocked mini bar in the room for soft drinks. Tea coffee machine fruit and daily nibbles.    The only negative I can think of is the alcohol is very expensive for example a gin and tonic is £16 cheapest bottle of wine (Moroccan) £28 ( which is rather nice) If you like a drink I would highly recommend you bring your own.    One evening my husband wanted to watch the football on the large screen in the conference room he was quite happy to sit on one of the chairs but the staff moved around 50 chairs maybe more and brought in a sofa and stool for him! Nice Touch.    I would highly recommend this hotel for a romantic escape and we will certainly be back in the near future.    Thank you to all the staff at the Royal Palm for a memorable relaxing and luxurious holiday.,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Deal, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahhR3688IV
Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Violette L wrote a review Aug 2015,40,Luxurious resort-style vacations,"Very luxurious resort style hotel.    I found it ideal for kids and for staying put without going inside Marrakech it has a great kids club kids restaurant service and huge resort pool (even though kids bedrooms are not very convenient: very high beds no in-room supplies.)    The service is amazingly efficient and kind even though the staff has to travel long distances on the property each time they bring a spoon or extra pillow.  They are adorable to kids and very welcoming to families.    Not a huge fan of the hotel's ""style"" architecture and design. Its too big too large common areas are too empty creating a weird atmosphere in some areas (around hotel shops).  Our bathroom must have been 60 square meters with 8 meters high ceilings all in brown marble with 1 kilometer of dressing room space. Feels really over the top. Not everyone is an Emirati queen travelling with 20 trunks of clothing it therefore feels a bit unpersonal and massive.    The resort for all its space and grandness doesnt even have a hammam and all in all feels too much like Dubai and not enough like Morocco.    I wouldnt recommend it for a couple unless you really like the resort feel.    The food wasnt amazing either the Moroccan restaurant lacked simple foods which are often the best- the breakfast service was too international too it didnt serve the Moroccan crepes that everyone adores when visiting. Its good but lacks authenticity.    Staff and administration are beyond sweet polite and professional but it lacks the presence the warmth and the cooking of local woman which can be found in other palaces in Marakech.",Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Paris, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Violette13
Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,benstopford wrote a review Aug 2015,50,A Level Beyond,So there were a fair few things we didn’t like about the Palm. The problem is there are so many unbelievably fantastic things about the hotel that the minor problems become dwarfed by its overbearing excellence.    The good:  - Even the cheapest rooms are truly fantastic. Double height ceilings. Huge folding glass doors onto a private terrace. These outclass suites in many top hotels we’ve stayed at. Great attention to detail too.  - The pool is stunning from the overall landscaping and gigantic size to the beautiful stone used to floor it. The hotel is far more beautiful in real life than the pictures indicate.  - Being set in a golf course provides a green oasis in the desert.  - Gym is top rate with a host of tennis courts and a squash court plus all the usual stuff you’d expect and its own pool.  - The bed just lovely.  - Service is generally excellent. All staff seem comfortable in the three main languages.  - Nice touches like a free minibar (although they don’t seem to restock it during your stay).  - Breakfast is pretty good too as you might expect.    The bad:  - Food tries a bit too hard for our tastes. It looked amazing but didn’t always taste all that special. After a few days we yearned for something simpler. In fairness there were a few simpler dishes on the lunch and room service menu but in the evenings the restaurant could benefit from some simpler heartier additions.  - We had a problem on checkin which could have been sorted quickly and efficiently if there had been a manager around. It took over an hour to sort out and I had to chase it to get it resolved. Probably an isolated incident and the original mistake was mine but the problem could have been handled more quickly and more effectively than it was.    I’m nit picking here though. The place is totally amazing. We’d definitely stay here again. The room prices in off season were reasonable (food bills mount up quickly though). The staff were great. Moreover it’s the most impressive hotel I’ve stayed in anywhere. True decadence.,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,london,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benstopford

The suites are all lovely and the beds really comfortable. It was just the little things that were frustrating there were a little plate of biscuits and cakes when I got to my room not covered though. The next day the ones I had left were still there. The mini bar drinks which were complementary were not restocked daily - not what you expect from a 6 star hotel.    Liked the golf cart 'taxi' service to take you too and from your room although I tended to walk.    The food was lovely but the service esp at lunchtime was really slow it took 30 mins to try and get a bill to sign one day I almost gave up after asking 5 times!    Did love the hotel but it is a bit far out of the centre for us and so on our next trip we will find a more central hotel.,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Market Bosworth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Emma_N68

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Tim M wrote a review Jun 2015,50,A VERY SPECIAL HOTEL EXPERIENCE,To be a 6 Star hotel requires more than just good amenities and the Royal Palm in Marrakesh has that certain something. It is a relatively new hotel but the owners have used Moroccan craftsman to give it a very traditional feel in a modern environment. Every public room has the WOW factor. The quality and attention to detail of décor and service is truly 6 Star. The rooms are in separate blocks away from the main hotel and are reached by chauffeur driven buggies. The rooms - suites are spacious with a living room and bedroom both of which have a private terrace with views of the gardens. The bathroom(s) is amazing and includes a deep bath large enough for 4 people a shower area big enough to hold a party with a separate toilet. The Dressing room has a great selection of wardrobe space and drawers. In door - out door eating is the style here. Breakfast is buffet style and offers many choice dishes to suite most taste buds. Lunch is a special affair serving up a selection of gastronomic delights on fine china which are delivered with aplomb.

The best thing is the staff - nothing is too much trouble and everyone greets you with a genuine warm smile. My kids went to the kids club most days and had a great time - it has its own pool. They also had their lunch there which is free and they also get loads of drinks and snacks included.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Michelle M wrote a review May 2015,50,Absolutely AMAZING,Just returned from a 4 night stay at this amazing hotel. Everything about it was top class and top quality from the servicethe amazing design and decor to the lovely staff.. I can't fault any member of staff everybody was so pleasant and helpful. We stayed in a 2 bed villa with a private pool it was truly exquisite we had our own butler Mourad who was a delight nothing was too much trouble for him he arranged all our restaurant bookings and made sure the buggy was there 5 mins before we were due to go out each nightkept the villa immaculate the highlight for my 2 teenage children was that he did their packing for them!!! There are 3 restaurants L'olivier just for lunch which was lovely and a very nice setting near the pool La Caravanne is for breakfast and dinner both of which were excellent really big choice of breakfast foods with lots of delicious home made bread and dinner was more formal an excellent french menu and again delightful staff. We ate in Al Ain (moroccan) we didn't like it but I think maybe we ordered the wrong things as other people I spoke with liked it. I think it would be good if L'olivier was open in the evenings as that would offer a more casual al fresco type of dining we had to go to La Caravanne for 3 of our 4 nights as we weren't keen of Al Ain and whilst La Caravanne is exquisite I think one of the nights I would have liked something a little less formal. My husband played golf a few times and enjoyed it. I went to the spa and had a really nice facial by a senegalese lady which was really good. OUr family sat having lunch one day and discussed marks out of 10 for each area of the hotel food service etc and they all got a 10 we then said what would we change and we honestly couldn't think of anything!!! Believe me for our family that's unusual!!! Definitely recommend this place.Also the great thing is it's only a 3 hour flight from the uk bit nearer than Dubai and hotel definitely better than the top hotels in Dubai!!!

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,whitecottage1 wrote a review May 2015,50,The ultimate chill out destination,"This hotel is palatial in huge private grounds about 20 minutes drive to south of the city.    Our room and the bars restaurants terraces and pool look over the greens and fairways of the hotel's immaculately tended golf course beyond which you have a jaw-dropping view of the nearby Atlas Mountains which stretch the entire length of the horizon.    Room was large and super comfortable with gorgeous marble bathroom dressing room with loads of cupboards and drawers (we should have brought more clothes and shoes!) and a big balcony facing the view mentioned above.    There's acres of space so very peaceful - almost feels like you have the place to yourself. I was only one swimming in the 80 metre pool (!). Bar is really dramatic plus superb meal in the traditional Moroccan restaurant (entirely staffed by women so almost feels like you are in someone's home - they are incredibly warm and welcoming and obviously love what they are doing). Breakfast was a feast in itself. Service was superb you don't have to lift a finger.    Perfect hotel if you want to escape hectic life at home/work and just flop. Or want to ""do"" Marrakech by day or night (there's free regular transfer by bus from hotel) and then have time/space to recover in perfect tranquillity. NB.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Rob M wrote a review Apr 2015,50,Seasoned traveller but first trip advisor review as I promised Aziz I would,"Wonderful hotel with beautiful grounds and an ambition to deliver the best in customer service. The service stood out. We had a minor problem on the first night which they dealt with well and after that we realised that the royal in the hotel name is how they treat their guests. We really did feel like kings and queens.  Rooms are huge and the entry level suite (they're all suites) is more than adequate for 2 adults. We upgraded to a bigger room but there was no need unless you had young children with you in your room. Our adult kids and their partners had the entry suites and loved them. We'd recommend a ground floor room though as you get a bit of garden and sunbeds rather than a balcony.  F&B quality is outstanding and priced accordingly. This is polarised a little as Marrakech is so cheap and it did hurt a bit knowing that but I would say it is value for money - top prices for top quality.  The grounds are amazing and so is the pool. The golf sports centre (gyms tennis squash studios) and spa are world class - probably the best hotel gym we've ever seen.  We stayed a week and loved it but there are a few things you should be aware of...  The base language in the hotel is French - most staff have English but not all - they do manage this well though and match staff to guests  Smoking is permitted anywhere on the resort and they don't have non-smoking areas in the restaurants or bars and cigars are popular ! Our clothes smelled of smoke after every night - I'd pretty much forgotten what that was like and it isn't nice.  There is no casual dining in the evening - it's formal dining or room service (2 restaurants - traditional Moroccan or upmarket international) - didn't see a pizza anywhere - they are building another restaurant but that's also fine dining  It's a fair way into Marrakech - £33 for normal return taxi or £55 for a hotel taxi - and there's nothing else nearby - you're a resort guest or your taxiing in and out of Marrakech  But as said it's an exceptional hotel and we will definitely return.  A few staff mentions...  Aziz there must be 10 of you - you were everywhere making sure everything was ""just right"" for us and your other guests - you are the most outstanding proponent of customer service excellence we have ever encountered and you did it in an understated and discreet manner - my family loved you and wanted to take you home !!  Mohammed - thank you for your warm welcomes every day and looking after me and my family with charm and an ever present smile  James (piano) - thanks for the beautiful soundtrack  ...and mentions for Yaseen (reception) and Nando Faatiha Rahal & Belkyeed [Sid] (restaurants)",Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flobmac
Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Simon S wrote a review Apr 2015,50,"A serene, beautiful hotel with breath-taking views of the Atlas Mountains.",This hotel was a joy to stay in whilst experiencing Marrakesh.    The food served in the restaurant and the terrace/poolside restaurant was excellent offering a mix of local and European food.    The pool was a pleasure with a natural shape in keeping with the surroundings and layered eternity pools leading down to it. Heated water jets kept the pool at nice temperature (Feb/March). From the pool you looked out onto the golf course and Atlas Mountains beyond on the horizon.    You can walk through the hotel gardens lined with olive groves or take a golf buggy taxi to and from your room which is beautiful and had the largest bed I have ever slept in. Some of the plants in the gardens are immature but the hotel is brand new so it’s to be expected.    All the staff we very friendly and polite. My only criticism would be the slow service for drinks and insistence on pouring drinks so even through Rose was within reach you often had an empty glass.. which wasn’t ideal sitting in the Moroccan sunshine.    Gym and Clarins’ spa on site…. If that’s your thing.    TIPS: book yourself on a quad biking trip into the desert – stunning views and we ended up have lunch at a gorgeous lakeside restaurant.    Check our the YSL garden and plan a couple of trips into the Medina BUT pay for a guide it’s worth it.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,WidcombeWanderer wrote a review Feb 2015,50,Away from the hustle & bustle of the city,For peace and quiet (views overlooked by Atlas mountains)  impeccable service great food plus use of an on-site superb 18 hole golf course you cannot beat the Royal Palm. We stayed a week. The suit was roomy and the beds very comfortable decor very pleasant and not at all garish as were some hotels we visited. The service was amazing and nothing too much trouble. The hotel has two restaurants one serving European/Western cuisine the other Moroccan. Both were excellent as was breakfast. The golf course is quite challenging but fair. Caddies are available (ask for Jaffa - or Jeff as he calls himself. He is excellent) as are buggies. We also played Assoufid and Samanah which were slightly more difficult and more expensive.  It takes 25 mins to get into the City centre and the hotel provides a free shuttle service about six times a day. If you travel outside of the hours serviced by the shuttle it can be expensive (about £40 round trip if you use the hotel car although on one occasion we were charged £85 for a third party car but refused to pay as we had asked specifically for the hotel car). One good ploy if going into the City for dinner is to take the 5:00pm shuttle and wander around for a couple of hours until dinner (you must try CastroMK and La Maison Arabe) then a taxi back at say 10:00pm. It should cost about 300 dirams (£25) although they will start at 400! At Castro the head waiter sorted out the taxi and price.  Marrakech is a great place to have fun eat well and play some good golf courses.

We ate in the hotel several times and everything was carefully prepared well presented and a pleasure to eat. The hotel is 7 miles from Marrakesh and the hotel runs a mini bus several times a day however if you wish to go after 16.30 guests will have to take a taxi which is around £20 each way.

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Jo wrote a review Oct 2014,50,Best hotel in Marrakech - unadulterated luxury,The Royal Palm Marrakech is a bit of a departure for Beachcomber as their other 9 hotels are located in Mauritius and the Seychelles and have set the bar incredibly high in terms of quality of accommodation and service. I was worried that this hotel may not live up to expectations but I had absolutely nothing to worry about it was excellent amazing fabulous.    It’s located around 7 miles from the city’s hectic centre and feels like a breath of fresh air when you enter the huge grounds and gardens which contain over 1000 olive trees. Bearing in mind how new this hotel is the gardens are lush and mature and there is no sign of them having been recently planted. It must have cost millions to do the gardens alone.    I stayed in a Palm Suite which gives you a little more room than the Junior Suite but other than that the fixtures and fittings are the same. Plush carpets a huge bed couches armchairs and a bathroom with the largest shower that I’ve ever had the pleasure of using along with an enormous freestanding bath. The furnished terrace is bigger than my first apartment in London!    We ate in the newly opened Al Ain restaurant which serves traditional Morrocan fare and in fabulous style. We were seated outside with our very own ‘Berber band’ and blazing fire. We ate tagine and sampled their ‘condiments’. The chillis are not for the faint hearted!    The skies were hazy (in a good hot way) and so we couldn’t see the Atlas Mountains from the hotel whilst we were there but as the temperatures drop they become more apparent. The weather was fabulous and we took full advantage of the frankly outrageously large swimming pool/ lake (2000m2!) which has steps down into it all the way along one side.    The staff at the hotel were polite and attentive and simply couldn’t do enough for us. You do need to remember that you’re in north Africa and that not everyone speaks fluent English but it’s always great to be able to dust off the A’ Level French for an outing or two!    The Royal Palm Marrakech is a truly luxurious hotel. It is a five star plus hotel. You’ll pay for this luxury but you’ll get your money’s worth and more besides.    My top tip would be to do a couple of nights in the Atlas Mountains followed by at least 3 or 4 nights at the Royal Palm.    We’ll return in the winter months. Thank you for an outstanding break.    Top tip: ask Beachcomber Tours to arrange for fast track customs passes both on arrival and on departure.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Frinton-On-Sea, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Frintononsea
Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Netherby wrote a review Sep 2014,50,Sublime,Just had a glorious few days in this paradise. Service food and accommodation certainly worthy of its 6*. Nice to be out of the city as you definately get the feeling of calm and serenity but 15 mins will have you in the centre of the action.    Staff could not do more to help and will definatley be back    Try the pool in the sports centre - quiet and peaceful.,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Netherby
Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Brenhan_Magee wrote a review Sep 2014,50,"""Fantastic service, quality and style""",This is the second time I have visited the hotel in three months the first was in May the second at the end of August. On my first visit I had booked five nights and was blown away by the service and quality so much that I extended the stay by a further two nights and as soon as I got home started to plot my return!!    I found all the the staff at the hotel a particular joy and would in a small way by writing this revue like to extend my thanks and gratitude to all for looking after me so well during my two visit's. Abdou was at hand at all times during the day and was an amazing host I am in the leisure industry and would cherish this kind of commitment in my business thank you Abdou! Hamza helpful at all times considerate and available to assist Ash in the pool side restaurant completely knowledgeable and impeccable with his servive The Head Chef though we unfortunately did not meet was outstanding in the quality of the food that was produced in all areas of the hotel the restaurants and room service spoke volumes truly some of the best quality food I have eaten around the world and Xavier the General Manager commands my respect for the operation he is running and was a pleasure to speak to at all times.    Anyone reading this thinking I am exaggerating please be under no illusion I am not I will most certainly be returning and I hope very soon!!!    Thank you again to all at the Royal Palm!!

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,noplacelikehomegirl wrote a review Jul 2014,50,LUXURY SERVICE AND INDULGENCE - OUTSIDE MARRAKECH,This hotel is the height of luxury quality and service. It is opulent and beautiful. The common areas of the hotel are impressive and stylish – with every detail taken care of. There are fresh flowers across all the spaces and these are a joy - artistically presented. Spotlessly clean it goes without saying. The bedroom (junior suite) is spacious with the most billowy soft crisp comfortable bed I have ever had in any hotel. The bathroom is also generously proportioned and beautiful. The room is relaxing and soft – the lights dim rather than turning straight off the water slows from the tap rather than just stopping. It is geared towards relaxation and indulgence. Well thought through touches that make a difference – a powerful hair dryer lots of storage great internet connection in all the spaces. A lovely terrace with a table chairs loungers and a couch. The pool is clear cool and beautifully laid out. The grounds are stunning. Overall it is a perfect relaxing indulgent place to spend gentle time.  The staffs are discrete yet attentive; special mention has to go to Mind in customer services who went so far above and beyond to make sure our stay was enjoyable. Khalid – reception; Hamzar – concierge; Cherihane – customer services and Khalid - driver - were all amazing.    It is worth mentioning though that this hotel is expensive. Not the room rate itself which is very reasonable for the quality and standard of the hotel but everything else. The food is 5 star London prices even for the simplest salads and pasta dishes. There is little choice. There is no light dining by the pool or snacks available. The hotel is also far out of Marrakech City (500 MAD for a taxi) so that also limits the choices. Worth being aware of. When we were there the occupancy was low (soft launch) so the staff were able to allow us access to the hotel shuttle – but without this or a car Royal Palm may seem like a gilded cage far from the colour and variety of Marrakech,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noplacelikehomegirl
Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,World Travellers wrote a review Jul 2014,50,Absolute bliss,We stayed in June for 3 nights and it was absolutely lovely. The suites are amazing and the views across to the Atlas mountains are stunning. The pool is a gorgeous place to while away the day and has roman steps all along it which means you can just slip off your sun bed into the water without having to walk to one end and get in.  The restaurants are lovely and eating dinner on the terrace with the table lit by moroccan lanterns with candles in is really pretty. They also have braziers burning in the evening and the smell from them with the candles makes it very atmospheric.  The staff are all really enthusiastic and eager to look after you so we felt very pampered. We had lunch at the poolside restaurant and that was lovely. The Club Sandwich is something special.  You are easily able to visit Marrakech city too and we took a guided tour in the afternoon and saw some really old parts of the medina where crafts and manufacturing hasnt changed for centuries. It was lovely to come back from the hustle and bustle and heat of the city to the calm oasis at the Royal Palm. We'll definitely be back.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,lordandlady,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lordandladya
Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,BertandDave wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Wonderful,We have just returned from a short break at this wonderful hotel. It was our first time in Marrakech but we knew we'd be in safe hands staying at a Beachcomber hotel as we have stayed at their 'Shandrani' in Mauritius a few years ago. We were not wrong! This hotel is amazing. We had a gorgeous suite-the bathroom was larger than most hotel bedrooms! The pool is wonderful with a stunning panoramic view of both the hotel and the Atlas Mountains. The staff were all courteous and keen to assist in making our stay as comfortable as possible. We are a family of 4 with 2 teenagers who had their own suite nearby. They both loved every minute of their stay and want to return as soon as possible-so much for a romantic break for two!!! Another winner from Beachcomber.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BertandDave

The place is amazing built as an oasis in the middle of nowhere surrounded by palm trees and olives and facing the breathtaking golf course; it has a huge swimming pool and a complete sports centre. It is decorated with such elegant taste fresh flowers and wonderful pieces of furniture and fabrics. The staff is super friendly and polite and the food is mouthwatering!!!

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Margaret L wrote a review Mar 2014,50,A Magic Stay in Marrakech,The Royal Palm may still be having the finishing touches done but it is far from sub standard. We were greeted with a wonderful and friendly welcome when we arrived. We were shown to our room and the rooms are luxurious. We had a stunning view of the golf course with the Atlas Mountains in the distance. The grounds of the hotel are spectacular- although most has just been planted- I'm sure it will look beautiful when they have established. The staff were so helpful as they were advising us on where to go giving us maps and tourist information.  We will certainly return!,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Woking, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MargaretL818
Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,WriteInBath wrote a review Mar 2014,50,A wonderful hotel in the making,The Royal Palm is a work in progress - they tell you as much when you book and there are some great offers to encourage you to go and see a hotel Beachcomber is clearly very proud of.    We went for some R&R and some sunshine in February and were pleasantly surprised. We knew that two restaurants are yet to open and that the Spa isn't complete and that there would be some building work going on - however the staff went to great pains to make sure that we hardly noticed (in fact the building work was at a distance to the rooms being used and so wasn't an issue)    The rooms are magnificent and luxurious providing a great resting space - and the food in the main restaurant (particularly in the evening) was fantastic. We had our two teenage children with us and between us I think we worked our way through most of the menu during our four night stay - we knew after our first meal when the kids said `we're definitely coming here again' that we were onto a winner with the Royal Palm.    We have stayed in another Beachcomber hotel in Mauritius and the level of service matched it. As the hotel was nowhere near capacity we probably had more staff being attentive than will be the norm in a few months time but they were always on hand and helpful without ever being invasive.    The facilities are excellent - the Sports Area is beautiful and spacious and private - in fact we spent a great deal of time by the pool there. Elsewhere the Golf Course is very impressive and a real attraction for those who like the game.    At the moment the trees and plants are all young and new so a number of areas which will be shaded and beautiful in the very hot weather are very exposed - including the main swimming pool area. But in time this will look fantastic.    As well as the lush gardens there are stunning views of the Mountains in the distance and the whole hotel complex oozed calmness wherever you were.    Yes there are still things to sort out - we wrong-footed them by ordering a room service lunch by the Sports Centre swimming pool which I think was a first for them but they coped even if the staff had been trained to provide the full silver service and so ended up with too many containers and silver lids for the poolside tables. And it seemed that wherever you were (restaurant or room service) food took about 45 minutes to arrive from the moment of ordering - so thinking ahead was important - but this was also probably partly due to the low occupancy in the hotel as everything was cooked fresh.    We'd thoroughly recommend this hotel - especially for people in the UK as it's so easy to get there you feel like you've travelled further than you have and the weather's so much nicer!    I'm sure fussy travellers will find fault with the hotel in these early months but if you accept that this is a work in progress which isn't going to be running at full throttle until the autumn and you're prepared to relax into the calm caring world the staff present to you then you won't be disappointed.    We'll definitely be going back...,Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bath, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WriteInBath
Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,LeonBekaert wrote a review Feb 2014,20,have no care for potential customers,after we played the golf which by the way is very nice.  we tried to have lunch in the hotelwhich seems impossible the kitchen was closed.  It is rather incredible that a hotel like that has a kitchen that closes that they don't have a roomservice 24/24.  After that we asked if we could see a room that again was impossible.  A lot of things seems to be impossible in a place where everything must be possible.  They seem to like to scare the potential customers with a lot of convictions,Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Damme, Belgium",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeonBekaert

Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Marc Lemmers wrote a review Jan 2014,50,"Just Perfect, a really 5 star ***!",For those who knows Beachomber hotels nothing to say. For those who don’t know the Royal Palm in Marrakech is just perfect!    I do a lot of business travel and was overwhelmed about the quality of this new opening (soft) of the Beachomber Royal Palm hotel during my short stay last week together with my wife which is a real 5*** star hotel.    Everything was so perfect every second of our stay. The suite was amazing very well designed and a lot of small details everywhere in the room that certainly make the difference among any other hotels.    The service and the politeness of the staff was the primary observation. Particularly outstanding were Mr Nuno de Sousa Director of Operations and Ms Aline AVRIL Management Service Director whose experience and concern for the customer helped us make several right decisions.    In general from the front office to the restaurant staff everyone made sure every guest was very well taken care!  The restaurant “Le Caravane” under leadership of his Chef “Philippe Jourdin” is excellent. The staff at restaurant Mr Saad chef de rang and Mrs Hasnaa who is Maître d’Hotel have given to us an excellent service.    The Domain Royal Palm with its 231 hectares absolutely beautiful wherever you look it is absolute perfection the attention to details is just extraordinary the gardens the architecture the people working at the hotel the rooms everything is the Highest Luxury standard that you can expect from a true five star.    We will go back shortly and hope that the SPA “Clarins” will be open by then.    The Royal Palm Hotel is without a doubt one of the most beautiful hotels in Marrakech.    We want to say to all the Staff members thank you!,Date of stay: January 2014,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Mondorf-les-Bains, Luxembourg",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marclemmers
