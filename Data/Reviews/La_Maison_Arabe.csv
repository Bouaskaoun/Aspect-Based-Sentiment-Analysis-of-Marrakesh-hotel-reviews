La Maison Arabe,Denise D wrote a review Mar 23,40,"Lovely hotel, friendly and attentive staff - only one disappointment","My husband and I stayed at La Maison Arabe for 3 nights during our visit to Marrakech. We found the hotel to be lovely and in beautiful condition the staff friendly and helpful and our room very comfortable. The breakfast was excellent and we especially enjoyed being able to dine by the pool on a beautiful spring morning. Our room also had a balcony overlooking the pool which we took advantage of in the evenings.    I took the cooking class sponsored by the hotel and thoroughly enjoyed it. The leader of the class had excellent English and the chef (who the leader translated for) was clearly a pro in the kitchen. The kitchen was well-equipped for learning and everyone had their own workstation. I learned several new techniques and recipes and I enjoyed dining on the fruits of my labors with my fellow classmates.    Here's my one disappointment: we also booked an excursion through the hotel listed under the ""Experiences"" menu of their website as ""Scenic Morocco."" It is an all-day trip to the Atlas Mountains visiting 2 kasbahs and the villages of Imlil. When our driver picked us up he did not introduce himself to us or even say good morning. All he did was confirm that we were the right people. He did not speak to us for the entire 1 1/2 hour drive to our first stop. First I thought this might be because he didn't speak English but later learned not only was this not the case but he was actually in tourism school. Anyway after an hour and a half he stopped in a village in front of a shop and started talking on his phone After a few minutes we finally said: ""What are we doing?"" He said ""Oh we are waiting for the man to come take you up to the kasbah."" After a while the man showed up and we hiked up to the first kasbah to have breakfast. It is stunningly beautiful and we enjoyed it. We wandered around there for a while and then asked someone at the front desk what we were supposed to do next. He said: ""oh you know the way back to the village right? Just walk back down."" So we did. What we didn't realize was that this village of one street and a few shops represented the entirety of the ""wandering through the villages of Imlil"" listed in the itinerary. We finally found our driver waving to us from a car park and got in the car.    We asked him ""what next?"" He said ""I'm taking you to your next stop."" So we drove 30 minutes to the truly fabulous Kasbah Tamadot. It is now about 11:30 and we have finished breakfast about an hour before. The people at the front desk asked us what we wanted to do. We said: ""What is there to do?"" They said: ""Well you can go hiking but it will take at least an hour for a guide to get here. Or you could do spa services. You are really just here for lunch which starts in an hour."" Having just finished breakfast we weren't too keen on lunch. So we wound up hanging around their admittedly beautiful terrace for an hour and half waiting to be a little bit hungry. We finally relented and ate something then got in the car and headed back to Marrakech. The driver never spoke more than a few words at a time the entire day. So I will say that we did see the Atlas Mountains but the day was nothing like I expected. Nor did I consider it to be worth the $540 we paid for it. Re-reading the experience description I fault myself for not asking more questions. But I think the hotel could do a better job of setting expectations.    All that said we still had a wonderful experience at La Maison Arabe. I would highly recommend it. Hopefully future travelers will do a better job than I did of asking questions before booking excursions.",Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Tampa, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveTraveling411

La Maison Arabe,Artur wrote a review Mar 21,50,Morocco people are very warm and kind - Maison Arabe is a testament of it.,We wanted a boutique hotel with the Morocco style instead of the other bigger hotels. It was a won bet as the intimacy and coziness is present the moment you open the door. The staff is always available nice warm and you feel their genuine interest to make you have a great experience. So Kudos first of all to HR as this team is fantastic. They help you on reservations hire a guide so you can go to trusted stores taxis etc. I also have a great story as I forgot my IPODs in the safe and already on the airport asked it they could send it to Portugal by mail. I was surprised to get a call 20m later mentioning the airpods were at the airport for me to pick it up outside. Thanks Ishmael. They are true ambassadors of the Morocco culture and heritage. As for the hotel it´s very nice clean tidy and silent. We do suggest you have breakfast in the hotel and try if for lunch or dinner as well. We felt a little bit ashamed to go out to other restaurants and then discover the quality of the hotel service that is 5*. As for the rest it´s very close to the Medina you are very safe to walk alone as a tourist as no one will rob you . Tourism is very important in this country and they take it serious. Thanks again Maison Arabe life is experiences and this one was fantastic. I stayed at a superior room with balcony to the pool and a suite - well worth it.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Porto, Portugal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AQMII
La Maison Arabe,Brian T wrote a review Mar 20,50,Superb Place!,What a wonderful place! The location was great and right in the middle of the Medina (old town) and couple blocks from their market.  The suites were absolutely fabulous with both an outdoor seating area and a rooftop seating area.  The place was decorated in local rugs and Moroccan decorations.  The staff was amazing- great service and super polite.  I HIGHLY recommend this place when in Marrakech.  One note- La Maison is a Riad and not a hotel. Big difference. Riads are like house with different rooms of different sizes. They are much smaller than an hotel and the layout is completely different. If you expect a traditional hotel this is not the place for you. If you are looking to stay at a 5 star local authentic place this is it!,Date of stay: March 2023,,"Dallas, Texas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/693briant

La Maison Arabe,Deshayne F wrote a review Mar 17,50,Maison Arabe is an outstanding Marrakech riad!,My husband and I spent three days at Maison Arabe in early March 2023. Originally we were only going to spend two nights but extended it to three and I'm so glad that we did! This was such a beautiful and relaxing hotel and the service was outstanding! We ate dinner in the poolside restaurant twice and really enjoyed our meals (we are vegetarian and found there were lots of options). We also took advantage of many of the activities they offer including: hammam (not to be missed) massage private walking tour of Marrakech (the guide was excellent) cooking class (on Morrocan salads) and a trip to their country club pool (about a 20 minute free shuttle ride from the hotel). I only wish we'd had another couple of nights to spend there!,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deshaynef

La Maison Arabe,alfonso2951 wrote a review Mar 11,50,Classic and original Marrakesh much better than any modern remake,We were at La Maison Arabe for my wife birthday and a 2 nights week end stay early march. The preparation of our week end was already done via email with the concierge and receptionists and when we got there it was even better than what we expected.  The place is 'real' Marrakesh's riad full of beautiful plants and trees 'used' rugs with the best traditional colous and texture and a wonderfull all maroccan team who is smiling at you every time they see you walking around the charming and a bit 'misterious' corridors and spa.  Food is really good we enjoied the 'asian' dishes but also the more traditional tajines.  The location is superbe very central but quite and secluded.  Service at '6' stars level we were able to look at different rooms for a possible choice but finally we staied in our pre-booked large junior suite. The director is a wonderful person very helpful and available he is thruely rare in the fast moving Marrakesh hotelerie.    We reccomend the hamman with a scrub done by local ladies who know exactly what to use and how to make you feel welcomed and still leave you in your personal 'bubble' during the whole experience.    A well known place where you feel at home and in the hart of the culture of this wonderful city.,Date of stay: March 2023,,"Gilly, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alfonso2951

La Maison Arabe,prefer 5 stars :-) wrote a review Mar 9,40,Lovely riad style hotel in great location,the property is exceptionally well positioned close to the median souks and many of Marrakesh’s attractions. We were able to walk to many of the places we wanted to see. The staff are unfailingly polite and attentive and offer excellent service. Our room (standard courtyard) was quaint if a little small. Being on the courtyard it wasn’t the quietest and you could also hear a little of the hustle and bustle outside but overall was very nice and comfortable ( however the shower soaked the bathroom unless you were very careful). We didn’t eat in the restaurant but it did seem very popular and the bar has a nice ambience and again attentive service. Overall a very nice hotel.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Boroughbridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichD1234

From the moment we stepped through the door we were so well looked after. The food was AMAZING the rooms really comfortable but the hotels true success is the incredible staff. They were all so friendly happy and helpful.  We loved going to the secret garden and swam in the huge pool. We used the spa several times and enjoyed the treatments. We went up to the mountains on a day trip again with a fabulous driver.  The hotel was a complete sanctuary away from the busy streets.  Well done on creating something very special.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,winchester,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jo5Winchester

La Maison Arabe,fussy011 wrote a review Mar 5,50,"Second visit, the same quality experience.",This hotel is fabulous.  Once experienced in November now in February.  Just inside the Medina. In superb location with Berber souk on doorstep spice for the senses.  The hotel is peaceful and calming.  Delightfully appointed creating a relaxing environment.  The reception managers are excellent attended ably to our every request.  The Hamman divine atmospheric relaxing a must do experience with very experienced staff.  Homely cocktail piano bar. Romantic dining experience quality of food a treat.  We also enjoyed a private Moroccan bread making tuition we were thrilled by the skills shared with us. Thankyou Dada.  Such a wonderful group of staff so ready and happy to meet the needs of visitors.  La Maison Arabe is one of my favourite places it feels like home.

La Maison Arabe,Andrew H wrote a review Mar 5,50,A wonderful place to stay,This hotel was excellent. A mixture between an Alladdin's Cave and a beautiful maze. There were different features on each floor that keep one interested. It has two wonderful open air patios with central water features. The dining area positioned by the swimming pool has a beautiful ambience. The Hammam was professional and provided a very nice environment for relaxing.    The staff couldn't do more they were eager to help and friendly everything ran smoothly from the reception to the cleaning staff and the restaurant (the food was very good).

We did the cookery class with Hamid which was excellent thank you for the free gift! Well worth visiting the country club on the free shuttle bus only for hotel guests and a short drive away if you want a break from the city bustle. Initially we were allocated a room which wasn’t what we’d booked but this was quickly fixed staff were really friendly and helpful. Loved the history of the hotel Churchill and Jackie Kennedy have stayed here.

La Maison Arabe,Rich B wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Outstanding experience in a wonderful hotel,My wife and I visited Marrkech for the first time recently (we are from California in the US) and stayed at La Maison Arabe and we had a fantastic experience. Lovely hotel with wonderful helpful staff and a really excellent restaurant. Our room was spacious and beautiful the entire hotel was also. The location was just right - within the walls of the old city walking distance to the Souks and the market square but far enough away and down a side street to have peace & quiet.

La Maison Arabe,libero7 wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Magnificent stay,Hadn’t been to Marrakech for 15 years and wanted to return with our kids (aged 12 and 9).    Had a royal suite which was perfect with the kids and the sitting room on the ground floor had been turned into a lovely little bedroom. Room was exquisitely furnished and bathrooms were stunning. Outdoor terrace with bath was spectacular.    Little swimming pool in the hotel patio was beautifully warmed so was very usable even in cold weather. Country club was a lovely trip one afternoon even if the pool was as bracing as a glacier!    Guides and cabs organised by the charming staff were all great location is idea for taxis to the new town or to walk to the medina. Lovely little neighbourhood very local and vibrant but with no hassle at all.    Dinner in the restaurant was traditional Moroccan fare and was very well done the piano bar felt like something from the 1940s and was fantastic for a nightcap. Breakfast was probably the only very mild disappointment. Not quite to the standard of the rest of the hotel all felt a bit crammed and lots of lukewarm non-labelled food. OK though.    Spa was fantastic and we had great massages. Overall nothing too much trouble for the staff we felt brilliantly looked after and the kids loved our short stay.    Look no further this is the best place in Marrakech.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/libero7

La Maison Arabe,Valerie i wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Fabulous location for a city break,We had an amazing time in La Maison Arabe. We were a party of 2 adults plus 3 children and we stayed in 2 x Standard Suite Pasha Side which was not in the main Hotel/Riad but in the building opposite. The entrance to our building was about 10 meters from the main Hotel/Riad entrance and it had it's own front desk which was manned 24/7. While I would have preferred to have been in the main building this building was very quiet and peaceful.    We booked directly with the hotel for the best deal.  All the staff we encountered from booking to check-out were extremely friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble from organizing taxis guides recommending restaurants etc    The location is great for exploring the Medina.  We visited the country club one afternoon using the free shuttle and it was a great place to relax and have a late lunch. The pool there was not heated though which would be my only complaint.  We did their cookery class which was good fun and I would say suitable for anyone from aged 11/12 upwards.  We also enjoyed using the Spa.    All in all its a lovely hotel and is perfect for exploring the old town and getting the most out of a city break to Marrakesh. I would recommend it to anyone planning a trip.,Date of stay: February 2023,,Ireland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/30somethingirish

The country house was a fantastic surprise - after wandering around the souk with a guide that the hotel organised we hopped on the free shuttle bus from the hotel and relaxed in the shade.

The breakfasts were very varied with all you could wish for and we loved the free afternoon mint tea and pastries every day! In the early evenings exempted a gin and tonic in the Jazz bar which had pianists playing and a really lovely atmosphere.

The Hotel is really good and the restaurant was excellent but on the pricey side. 3 course meal for 2 with a decent bottle of wine will set you back £150 approx. The Hotel is known for its food and so I signed up for a 3hr Cookery Class. It was fantastic Wafa was a great host very friendly knowledgeable and spoke good English. Fatima the Chef with her beaming smile and relaxed approach (No Gordon Ramsey type rants from her!) Was an excellent tutor. I prepared a Chicken Tagine with an Aubergine Salad and another salad made with Harissa. I also made a type of Bread called Bakbout and a desert called Pastilla (similar to Mille Feuille. I had lots of explanation of the culture and importance of food in Marrakech plus information on all the different spices. This was followed by a tea demonstration from Sukina and again it was very good. The 3 hours passed very quickly and then I got to sample my 3 course meal with my wife.

The work stations we used were very extremely modern and clean. There were video screens so we could each see close ups very clearly. Then after we'd made our delicious dishes we sat down to eat them together. This is really not to be missed. Informative very friendly and SUCH GREAT FUN. Loved it. Shukran Wafa and Fatima.

La Maison Arabe,larrysf2018 wrote a review Jan 2023,50,The Best In Marrakesh!,An absolutely amazing experience. Unlike any other hotel I visited in Marrakech this warm authentic and charming riad exudes old-world class and grace from the moment you walk through the front door. La Maison Arabe is in a perfect location just a few minutes walk to the souks main square and Koutoubia Mosque. Breakfast is abundant and delicious the spa is quiet and delightful and the rooms are clean spacious and beautifully appointed. What really sets La Maison Arabe apart however is the hotels's extraordinary personnel from the bartenders at The Jazz Bar to the the entire dining staff who greet you every day with a smile and simply cannot do enough to make your experience memorable. And last but not least kudos to all my friends at the front desk especially Mourad and Raja who responded effortlessly with every request and made me feel like I was part of the family.

La Maison Arabe,Max M wrote a review Jan 2023,50,Perfect End to our Honeymoon,Our stay at Maison Arabe was fantastic. The hotel itself is a beautiful series of riads (homes with central courtyards) which have been connected. The room restaurant and pool are exquisite. The hotel came recommended by our guide and we stayed 5 nights at the end of our honeymoon. Each hotel was more fabulous than the last but Maison Arabe was particularly awesome. While the hotel is gorgeous and intimate the real highlight is the staff. Three in particular deserve praise: the manager Yassin is charming and attentive. Whenever we had a question or a specific need Yassin was just ‘there’ like magic. If I were in the hospitality business I’d ask him to name his price! Said who is chief bartender at ‘Le Club’ (the jazz bar) was wonderful. His cocktails are delicious and unique. He’s also a fascinating and engaging person. Said entertained my wife and I endlessly and even helped us with our Arabic! Finally Abdellah our waiter made us feel very special (to say nothing of the excellent food at the restaurant). Excellent sense of humor! All said Maison Arabe is an oasis of peace in the bustle of Marrakech.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K8494PWmaxm

La Maison Arabe,Kari D wrote a review Jan 2023,50,The best of both worlds!,"My family of 5 loved La Maison Arabe! It was a perfect home base for us in Marrekesh for 4 days. We had a deluxe room and a standard suite for our 3 kids (older teenagers). Both rooms were lovely. The suite was especially nice because the 3rd bed was in its own little niche so it wasn't so crowded in the main space. Rooms were good-sized and clean. Beds were very comfortable with soft sheets. Bathroom was nice - clean spacious and good products with fluffy towels. I have read a few comments about the hot water - we had no problem at all. Plenty of hot water and good water pressure (weak water pressure is a pet peeve of mine).    The hotel itself is very unique & charming with lots of different areas to explore. The bar was old-school with dim lights and dark furniture. We loved going there after a day of exploring for a drink and some delicious appetizers. Breakfast by the pool was lovely - good coffee and eggs made to order. My kids say there was a pancake station. Plus the usual Moroccan buffet. We only ate dinner there one night and it was fabulous. Food delicious and excellent service.    The location of La Maison Arabe is in my opinion perfect. Technically it's ""inside"" the medina. I will be honest...I was hesitant about that at first. Our first stop in Morocco was Fes and one night we had dinner at a lovely riad in the medina. But it was pretty deep in and seemed sort of...inconvenient for more than a dinner. In contrast La Maison Arabe is about a block or so into the medina so you can indeed walk out the door and head further in to the stalls and reach the main square easily. But it's also near enough to a street that if you are dropped off by a taxi you don't have to hike in the dark for several blocks. It was ideal. The best of both worlds.    The staff was excellent. Front desk always had warm greetings and very helpful with questions. Restaurant staff very efficient. Housekeeping responded quickly to our request for more bottled water & the room always very tidy when we returned after a day out.    We did not take advantage of any of the spa services or cooking school simply because we didn't have time. There is so much to see and do in Marrakesh.    I would recommend La Maison Arabe to anyone with no hesitation. It is a real gem in Marrakesh the perfect blend of old-school charm and modern comfort!",Date of stay: December 2022,,"La Jolla, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/689karid

Location fantastic - turn right out of door and the main square and soukhs are a short walk away turn left and the new town area is equal distance.

Internet patchy. We can live with all that but not with not being super clean with super service at £400 a night. Just not right.

La Maison Arabe,Tara F wrote a review Dec 2022,50,Traditional & beautiful boutique hotel situated in a perfect location,So happy we chose this over other more modern hotels and those further out of town.    A very traditional charming and historic boutique hotel situated inside the medina but close enough to walk to the modern parts of the city.    We booked a regular suite with access to a forecourt but got upgraded to the three storey Chem suite which was fabulous with a private rooftop terrace complete with a cabana & jacuzzi. It also gave us the convenience of two bathrooms and a huge living room.    The hotel itself has lots of beautiful space nooks crannies and historic artefacts so be sure to explore.    We tried the pool side Trios restaurant which serves a fusion so there should something for everyone on the menu. On the pricey side portions aren’t that generous and a bit too quite out of season to hat we felt we had to whisper. And there are similar restaurants nearby but you cannot take away from the convenience and tranquility of being by the stunning pool area and the menus light up so no need to use your phone torch which is par for the course in many places in Marrakesh.    The reception staff are extremely polite and efficient and offer good advice when it comes to navigating the medina. They will also offer a guide if you’re not confident exploring the medina alone.    However our suite is not recommended if you’re unsteady on your feet or have arthritis as the stairs are pretty steep. My knees were creaking after a day out walking the city. The shower and tap water are also a little temperamental going from very hot to cold in the shower and had some warm toothbrushing with all taps running hot. And okay some of the bedroom decor is a bit worn tricky to open a wardrobe a huge lamp bizarrely blocking the TV but it all sort of added to the charm of the place. Although don’t expect a very early quiet night as the hotel is echoey so you can often hear noise from other rooms and the reception.    But overall for the price location amenities & ambiance we’d not choose anywhere else. Next time I’d definitely take advantage of the hammam & spa treatments.,Date of stay: December 2022,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Denham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taraf861

The class was brilliant with the cookery demonstrator Houda and the workshops manager and interpreter Simo both being exceptional. We watched flatbreads being baked in a wood oven and drank mint tea while Simo explained how the day would progress. Off to the kitchen to meet Houda and bake some cookies before getting down to business. Everything was really well organised and explained and help was on hand while we cooked the chicken and lemon tagine a hot tomato salad and an aubergine salad. There were 4 of us so easy to watch the cook and easy to get help if necessary. We learned how to make flowers from the tomato skin - a case of waste not want not? Anyhow it was illuminating as I’d never managed to make flowers successfully before. We then got to eat what we’d prepared as well as a dessert and some of the cookies. It was a fabulous 5 hours or so made extra special when we were given a tagine dish and the recipe cards to take away.

La Maison Arabe,Lesley wrote a review Oct 2022,50,Beautiful Hotel in the Medina,We stayed here for 5 nights. We had an issue with our initial room but Abdil was very customer orientated and came to our rescue and did a great job by taking care of the room situation. The food is very good and so is the breakfast. Lots of variety. The hotel is close to almost everything you need or want to do in Marrakech. We had a hammam at this hotel and it was bliss. The hotel has a shuttle bus that takes you to a resort that's roughly 15 minutes away where it has a beautiful pool and great service. You can order lunch and drinks here. It was very relaxing and peaceful. We also participated in a cooking class which was excellent. We did a tour of the medina on our first day through the hotel and the tour guide was great. Would definitely recommend!!!,Date of stay: September 2022,,Canada,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DesignByLesley
La Maison Arabe,Megan O wrote a review Oct 2022,50,A gem,La Maison Arabe is an incredible riad and escape from the hustle and bustle of Marrakesh! The riad is stunning and each room is a safe haven (we had 2 different rooms due to our travel plans). Being the first riad in Marrakesh gives it an authentic magic. The jazz bar with the live pianist is a perfect way to slow down and unwind the tea foyer is a great spot to take a break and relax and the restaurants are delicious! The spa was amazing and I highly recommend a hammam/massage here. We also took a cooking class here that was so fun and special. But what stands above everything was the staff! They were so welcoming and attentive. Every time we walked through the reception area we greeted with warm smiles and hellos. They are extremely helpful with any questions/needs whether it’s storing your bags navigating the city or just welcoming you back from being out. This is the spot to stay at in Marrakesh for an authentic riad experience that feels like home!,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Megklim
La Maison Arabe,Liathach2 wrote a review Oct 2022,50,Exceptional,"We cannot recommend La Maison Arabe too highly. Down a narrow passage off the road stepping into it is like stepping into an oasis of calm and tranquillity after the madness and chaos of the souks of Marrakesh.  A labyrinth of intimate cosy spaces leading off from the central courtyard each decorated in the Moorish tradition and carefully lit to bring out the best of the rich colours and textures. The cosy lounge area has a large picture of Sir Winston Churchill who was regular guest. The jazz bar has music as befits its name.  Everywhere is immaculately cared for and maintained.  Our room was on the compact side and the suitcases easily got in the way. But the room itself was very good and the bed super-comfortable.  One small problem was that the bathroom was up an unguarded flight of steps which needed careful negotiation with a torch in the dark to avoid an accident. The windows looked out over the central courtyard and let in lots of natural light.  The restaurant and pool were in the newer part of the Riad with tables also set among some small trees and along the side of the pool. Lit by candlelight it was lovely. The restaurant itself was beautiful with rich wood panelling and carefully lit to create the right atmosphere.  The food was excellent the service likewise. Surely the largest breakfast menu we had during our stay in Morocco and beautifully presented.  The staff were excellent nothing was too much trouble. A small complaint we did have was swiftly attended to.  If you should tire of the restaurant food then you can try your own hand at cooking dinner in the cookery school belonging to the hotel. Unsure of what to expect we were very impressed by the very modern cookery area and the tuition on offer. However they do make sure you don't fail which is a relief.....  Then together with your fellow ""chefs"" and a good glass of wine eat what you have made downstairs in the dining area. A great and fun experience.

Each room is unique and beautifully decorated and appointed. We were delighted with our private little courtyard for late afternoon cocktails. From our delicious and refreshing welcome drinks (very welcomed) to any and every request being fulfilled the staff were helpful and gracious. The spa and hammam were huge hits with several of the group booking multiple and repeat treatments. The dinner selection was wonderful and each meal was out of this world delicious. Breakfast had a large selection of almost everything immaginable.    The location is a short walk to the medina and very central to the highlights of Marrakech.

La Maison Arabe,Matthias O wrote a review Oct 2022,50,"Outstanding residing in a historical palace, an architecure-artwork.","La Maison Arabe asked me to write a review about their house. I am happy to comply.    To say it's just a historic riad would not do it enough credit. It is truly a venerable architectural work of art right in the centre close to the souk alleys a hidden gem. There is also modern technology in the house the wifi is absolutely stable flat screen in the room but if you are looking for minimalist contemporary furnishings this is not the place for you. This riad has aged gracefully and wants you to continue to see its age. Nevertheless everything has been neatly restored. The staff place a very high value on cleanliness. Even under the carpet tables they are always wiped. Of course every now and then there can be a small mistake a little something can be forgotten. But with this stay I didn't notice anything.    First of all the gastronomy. If you're looking for star cuisine with the last haut-cuisine invention you should go somewhere else. But if you're looking for really good quality lovingly prepared food that doesn't have to hide from other big restaurants this is the place to go. For example we had spicy grilled prawns with a kind of red curry as a starter and ""pineapple salad"" as a side dish and the beef tajine (really outstanding) as a main course in its broth caramelised almonds and dried fruits. The other dishes at the neighbouring tables also looked very tasty. And you should not be afraid of Moroccan wine e.g. Chateau Roslane they are good even if not top world wines. Here I would have liked more experience from the staff also because I asked. Here I would also like to see more courage from La Maison Arabe. Are there special wineries with special vintages that one should have drunk? Here I would have been willing to pay more money. But perhaps as a wine lover and collector that is asking too much. I used to talk to Sommeliers. I am complaining on a too high level. And please with the temperatures in Marrakech always order a wine sleeve even with the red wine. Our wine was well tempered.  The breakfast is really okay no…. it is really very good; the pouched egg was perfectly prepared. You can find all the usual things at the breakfast buffet. It's very good quality the yoghurt homemade freshly made Moroccan crepes fresh juices. But somehow I felt the final touch was missing here the final icing on the cake. Because with this unique courtyard terrace by the pool if there was a spectacular buffet…. Maybe complaining on a very high level. Generally let me say…. You have a very good breakfast there.  The Jazz Bar give you a perfect finish nice piano playing and good classical drinks.    About the room. We had a suite. I don't think La Maison Arabe has too many rooms maybe 30 I think I read somewhere. It is a small boutique hotel. The bathrooms were classically elegant there are no modern minimalist bathrooms as we know them today. However the bathrooms are beautiful very well maintained (as if this classic furnishing had been installed only recently) and meticulously clean. Not a single smudge or fine hair was to be found. Otherwise our suite was typically Moroccan. It would be difficult to furnish it with modern furniture. In Europe not only the house would be listed as a heritage but also the rooms and their furnishings. Nevertheless it was very pleasant and cosy. The mattress and the bed linen. A dream from the Arabian Nights.    About the country club: definitely use it definitely go there. The drive is really not far. Forget the hustle and bustle of the old town for a few hours wash off the dust. You find there a nice pool in a lovely garden beside an old Moroccan manor house. Even the food there is fresh and delicious. We had a classic club sandwich which was with wholemeal toast and very tasty and the St. Pierre fish with an insanely delicious sauce. Again not star cuisine but excellent quality.    The hammam. I think we had the Royal Session which is a classic hammam scrub down masks and a 45-minute massage. My wife another anti-age care. It's worth every penny. Definitely try it. This is a traditional hammam not a sprawling bright spa temple. Not every last in-treatment every super-modern beauty session is included. But does it need to be? Everything important can be found and in good quality. And it is absolutely beautiful in this architectural building. This is how you imagine a luxurious hammam from the Arabian Nights. The staff are well trained and extremely courteous. Therefore a visit to this hammam should be a must.    About the staff: La Maison Arabe does not only try to provide a good service but they also really try to fulfil every wish if possible. The staff is discreet but always ready to help when needed. They are very nice and polite. You also notice that the staff are trained as is usual with such a house. Of course you can look for mistakes and you will always find some. It's not really relaxing is it? You can always improve. Just let me say it to you from a professional point of view (because I used to work in upscale hotels and restaurants myself as a young man learned it from the bottom up so to speak.)  Apart from French of course all the staff speak English and if they don't they immediately get another staff member who does. Also the staff really try their best. That is enough for me as a guest. I am not looking for perfection. I just want to have a pleasant relaxing stay. And her it was outstanding. You can observe that they try to be perfect so that you can have an unforgettable stay. What do you want more?    Therefore I can only say that La Maison Arabe was the right choice for 2 nights. It doesn't want to be super modern even if it has all the modern amenities. It just wants to be La Maison Arabe. A historical institution in Marrakech. A hidden palace close to the old souk alleys beautiful and absolutely central. Where you can experience ancient history where they try to do their best. There are always things to improve as I mentioned above but my wife and I were absolutely happy to stay here. La Maison Arabe also takes requests and reviews very seriously. Because they know what their responsibility is. If we were to travel to Marrakech again La Maison Arabe would be our first choice.",Date of stay: October 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M-Obermaier76

The few nights we stayed at this riad were beautiful. Located at the entrance to the medican made it quite easy to navigate our sightseeing during the day and return to a pleasant and quiet oasis. The team members were very friendly and accommodating. While I had one of the lower category rooms (since I was the single traveler in our group) the room was still extremely comfortable. The bed was comfortable and the shower pressure was great. The meals we had were wonderful. Breakfast was included in our room and was quite a delicious spread and able to eat outside poolside. The one group dinner we had was wonderful and delicious as well. The gym is very small and limited but I was able to locate a slightly bigger facility inside the medina and 10 minutes walking which was a good substitute.

In addition to the various tagine's (which everyplace in Morocco has) the dinner menu included other dishes Despite the fact we didn't use it the La Maison Arabe also had a hammam thereby eliminating the need to look elsewhere for one.

We initially booked for 4 nights and the experience was so good that we extended it and stayed a week. As soon as you enter La Maison Arabe you are in for a treat. Mourad and Raga at the front desk are outstanding and did everything to make sure we had a magical experience. They are so kind approachable and provide first class customer service at all times!  We used the pool at the country club and this was heaven on earth! The waiters were so attentive and accommodating we felt amazing! Everything was clean and luxurious. We had food there and the club sandwich was AMAZING!    The breakfast team welcomes you with a big smile and I was always looking forward to my breakfast- the square crepes with honey YUM YUM!!    I also used the SPA and I highly recommend it! The lady at the front desk was so welcoming and made sure that I had an unforgettable experience. I enjoyed chatting with her about London and France.    The jazz bar is a must. The decor is so impressive!    The food at the restaurant was also a 10/10!  I speak French and my husband English and all staff were switching language at all times .  We booked a guided tour and the guide was just spectacular going above and beyond to make sure we had a fab time!    To sum up we will be back as we doubt any other places can top our experience!

La Maison Arabe,CBD4 wrote a review Aug 2022,50,One of my best hotel experiences ever.,Simply put my stay at Le Maison Arabe was one of the absolute best experiences I have ever had while traveling.    I'll start with the service. Every single one of the team members seemed genuinely happy to be therefocused on making sure that every need was met and that I had a perfect experience. They are knowledgeable kind and friendly and were always patient with me as a first-time visitor to Morocco that had 100 questions a day.    Special acknowledgement goes to Adil (who is the definition of anticipatory customer service) Raja and Brahim. It would not surprise me if they were graduates of the St. Regis service program; they are that good.    The facilities and spa are also absolutely top-notch. The design and local flavor are at once modern and timeless...I felt like I was living in a classic Hollywood movie while also enjoying up to date amenities and comfort.    The Hammam/spa and the country club.... Do yourself a favor and take advantage of them. World-class.    I now know that this is my go-to lodging in Marrakech. I highly recommend that you see and experience it for yourself.,Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Dallas, TX",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CBD4
La Maison Arabe,austininternational wrote a review Jul 2022,50,"Authentic, architectural gem",Where to start?! This lovely hotel is a standout among standouts from our two-week trip across Morocco. The service is first-class; the bar and dining room exude old-world elegance similar to what you'd find in Paris and New York; there are layers upon layers of art tile and richly carved wood; and our room was fit for a king (request the Noor Suite 222 with its own roof top patio). We visited La Mamounia for dinner and I would stay here over there every time.,Date of stay: June 2022,,"Austin, Texas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/austininternational
La Maison Arabe,Sanford L wrote a review Jul 2022,50,Great experience with a very nice and accommodating staff,This hotel is tucked away and very unassuming from the outside. Inside it’s very quaint and the rooms are large and comfortable. Food is excellent and they have a menu that can accommodate various palettes. The staff is really nice and we’re very attentive. I truly appreciated the entire staff and will definitely recommend others to have a stay here if they are traveling to Marrakech.  P.S. take advantage of the country club- just a short tram ride away to experience the quiet and relaxing pool area and cabanas. Staff and food there are excellent and was a very nice surprise.

La Maison Arabe,T M wrote a review Jul 2022,50,Hidden Gem & Impeccable Service,We were a group of 11 executives from all over the US that were visiting Marrakech for the first time. We decided to arrive a few days before our meetings to explore the city on our own expense. Each one of us individually booked a room at this amazing property. We all have high expectations when we travel together and we couldn't believe the outstanding service we received and how well maintained this property is in the Medina.    We tried every experience the property offered; from the three hour cooking class to the spa (Hammam) to the mid-day tea service and even went to the country club. We were floored at how amazing this place was.    A big thank you to Mr. Jillou and Raja who made this personal/business trip the most memorable one. We booked personal transportation on behalf of the hotel for all 11 of us (we all arrived on different days and different flights). There must have been over a dozen of emails back and forth to get all of this taken care of by Mr. Jillou. We booked restaurant reservations and walking tour guides of the Medina that were quickly taken care of by Raja who was so nice and professional.    For a small property to handle 11 check outs all at once seamlessly tells you a lot of what they can do! Should our travels bring us back to Marrakech there is no doubt all of us would book this hotel once again.,Date of stay: July 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tmX5570KY
La Maison Arabe,Janet C wrote a review Jul 2022,50,Perfect Oasis in the Middle of the Medina,La Maison Arabe was simply amazing. The location of the hotel in the Medina was perfect for access to the souks and sight seeing. The hotel is beautifully elegant & relaxing with exceptional staff who could not be more friendly & helpful if they tried. No task was too small for them from arranging guides ordering taxi's or obtaining tickets. To compliment the city centre location the hotel also has a beautiful country club with pool approx 20 mins away with a shuttle bus running every hour. Again the staff at the country club could not be more helpful or friendly. I could not recommend La Maison Arabe highly enough.

La Maison Arabe did not disappoint. To say we had an amazing time in this beautiful hotel would be an understatement. Located ideally in the middle of the city and easy to find. The hotel staff couldn’t do enough for us and were so attentive. There is a swimming pool there but they also have one 15 mins away via a free hotel shuttle service which runs every hour. This pool is bigger and set in a beautiful hidden garden. Complementary drinks are given on arrival. They have food available with plenty of loungers and cabanas.  My son and I booked a 3 hour tagline cooking class with the cookery school which is attached to the hotel. The teaching chef and translator were friendly and easy to understand. We loved it and the food was delicious. We also used the attached spa for treatments which were excellent. the breakfast was excellent the list could go on.

Lovely room (junior douiria) opening off a small courtyard. ALL the staff were so friendly and courteous and couldn't have been more welcoming.  The Cookery school is a must- 3 hours later a tasty tagine and salads to be consumed . The Spa was superb. The Royal Session was my first experience of a Hammam followed by a wonderful 45 minute massage.  Such a beautiful setting for dining around the pool .Breakfast was a feast which we had to finish with a Moroccan pancake made to order by the poolside!

La Maison Arabe,WilliamWillieWilson wrote a review Jun 2022,40,"Amazing service, pretty nice hotel",This upscale hotel (by Moroccan standards) has absolutely amazing food! The chef is probably the high point of the entire stay especially his masterful rack of lamb available at each dinner. The breakfast buffet is also extensive. The hotel spa offers hammam (a Turkish bath) which is the unique experience of having your skin thoroughly scrubbed clean while relaxing in a steam room. This can be followed by a very relaxing but not very effective massage. As a warning if you suffer from asthma you’ll feel tremendous torture in the steam room so skip the hammam. La Maison Arabe also has excellent proximity to Jemaa el-Fnaa Square where all the action is.    There are a few downsides that prevent this from snagging a five-star rating. There are a lot of pigeons which isn’t the hotel’s fault. But you’ll see a lot of pigeon poop on your patio and feathers coming through the open-air slotted windows in some of the rooms where the pigeons roost at night. We found all the sinks and the shower to be clogged and one toilet button and the television were broken none of which you’d expect to find in an expensive suite. You also won’t find USB ports which is unfortunate in this day and age. But La Maison Arabe is trying hard to offer a fabulous experience in a less developed nation. The staff is absolutely fantastic and the hotel is definitely a jewel in Marrakech.

I first got to know of La Maison because in 2020 during the pandemic I took up several online cooking lessons with them which I thoroughly enjoyed. They said YES to all my requests to learn even difficult dishes not on their usual menu list. Thanks to Souad (who was still there at that time) Haznah and the dear Dadas!    The Riad was beautiful and we loved our douriya room with our own courtyard. We enjoyed the quiet and calm and the service and staff were impeccable! From Mostafa who booked our room and to the front office staff: Adil Mourad Hakim Ismail Driss Raja Aziz Mehdi Ahmed Fatima and Rachida.    The food for lunch and dinner at Le Trois Savoirs was delicious and we enjoyed the Moroccan pancakes everyday.    Since we had to check out early even if our flight was still at night we spent time in their private gardens by the pool where we had a leisurely lunch and when we went back to the Riad they allowed us to take a shower at their spa to freshen up.    I had my free cooking class in their well organized kitchen and enjoyed the lunch immensely.

The 3 night stay did not disappoint! The room the staff the food the everything..5 stars all around. Truly a unique riad that felt very much like we were staying in a hotel unlike anything we could ever find in the USA. I'd akin this Riad to what Americans might expect from a St. Regis Intercontinental or hotel of that caliber. But much more intimate. The staff defined the expression ""overdeliver"" and went that extra mile for us in every way.

La Maison Arabe,dr83 wrote a review May 2022,50,Highly recommended hotel that meets all the detail to make your stay in Marrakesh brilliant!,This is a lovely little boutique hotel with a great location. I have visited this hotel before and eaten several tikes as well (an old haunt of Winston Churchills).  We were given walk around after a very refreshing welcome Moroccan juice in the courtyard which was a very tranquil setting with the birds flying above into the open and a soothing sound of the central fountain.  We managed to book a last minute slot in the hamman which i must say is up there with the other ones I have had during my other 5 trips to Marrakesh. It is extremely good value and we also had a massage (again one of the best i have had).  The room was spacious and nice. The outside approach the carved door and the interior decor was lovely. The only thing I would add was they should provide 2 caffeinated nespresso pods instead of 1 decaf and 1 caffeinated but we could have rung reception and asked for one to be sent up.  The bar is wonderful although they had run out of gin which would have bothered me ordinarily but the other aspects of the experience up until that point were so nice it did not bother me.  The outside restaurant surrounding the central pool was lovely (worth a visit for lunch or evening when lit by candle light if you are bot a guest).  We dined in the Moroccan restaurant which was again stunning spacious yet cost and intimate and very comfortable. I am a little bit of a food snob but the dining experience was exceptional and very good value. Our host was super and looked after us very well. The musicians were very very talented and played the most hypnotic and calming music.  The staff are very helpful here too and even arranged and haggled for a taxi for us turning down drivers as they were bot negotiating a good enough rate for us.  The hotel has a country club with free shuttle buses to and from. Thought the day. It has a larger pool  And facilities but sadly we did not have time to visit but will do on our return later in the year when we stay here again!    Thank you for a wonderful stay and see you soon.

They truly went above and beyond to make our stay perfect handling logistics and transportation for all external activities recommending great local gems and making sure we always had everything we needed (and didn’t even know we wanted) at all times.

The staff were more than happy to help. The room was similarly tastefully decorated spotlessly clean and very comfortable. Dinner in the restaurant was exquisite (I still dream about the Tanjia a la Marrachia). Breakfast was also very enjoyable sat right next to the swimming pool. The stay was made even better with a visit to the Maison Arabe cooking school next door. The only downside to the stay was that it was only for one night.

We arrived after breakfast we’re served coffee and fresh orange juice at the pool. In their SPA we had relaxing massage and spent a day on the rooftop. Dinner was another treat obligatory to reserve in advance because it was full. After dinner a night cup is a must have in their Jazz club. Rooms and the whole hotel are example of wonderful arabic architecture with all the coridors stairs amaizing furniture. Last but not least thier staff is very friendly obliging in all your needs.

The decor was beautiful and cosy. Lots of attention to detail given to the decor which we really admired!  Good location in Medina we were able to walk to a lot of the main tourist sights.  Extremely friendly and helpful staff. They organised our day trip to the mountains and prepped us well as to what we should expect the walk to the waterfalls would be like.  Breakfast was nice again authentic cuisine which is exactly what we wanted!  Amazing Hammam spa - definitely must visit!  Only disadvantage is that the swimming pool on site doesn’t look like it can be used as it’s by the restaurant and the 2nd swimming pool is in a different location. Free hotel shuttle provided and the pool itself and grounds are nice but it is inconvenient if you just fancy a quick swim.

This trip had been planned well over a year ago and was incredibly important for me as both parents battled cancer during COVID and was planned and cancelled multiple times. It was critical that we selected the ""perfect"" accommodations and I can tell you that La Maison Arabe exceeded all my expectations! The riad itself is beyond gorgeous. Even though I researched thoroughly viewed all the videos on Youtube followed them on IG looked through reviews regularly on TripAdvisor....nothing prepares you from experiencing it in person. We considered La Mamounia Royal Mansour and other high end hotels and I am so glad we stayed here. There is a warmth and authenticity here that cannot be matched. The service is phenomenal and they really go above and beyond to make sure that everything is perfect. The breakfasts are incredible as are the dinners. The spa is heaven.....and I will truly miss having tea anywhere in the riad that I wanted. I can't thank the staff enough for making this trip so very special.

La Maison Arabe,T D wrote a review Dec 2021,50,Beautiful Riad,We stayed at the La Maison Arabe for two nights and it was wonderful! We stayed in room 264. It is a smaller room but it was beautifully decorated. Once you arrive at the hotel you're given this delicious Welcome drink. We are then walked to the room and were shown the feature of the room (e.g. how to use the safe etc). Room had a king size bed that was comfy and outfitted with a lot of pillows. Staff at the hotel were friendly and attentive. We were invited by our tour guide to a dinner in his village outside Marrakech and we asked the front desk if they could provide us with a cake last minute. and they happily provided us with a cake within 30 min - it was a delicious chocolate mousse cake that was a hit with our tour guide and his family.    The hotel is located on a side street so its quiet at night and you dont hear the noise from the street or the Medina. Yet it is close to the Medina about 10-15 min walk. We walked to the Medina and felt safe. there is also a small BIM/ supermarket near the hotel about 5 min. walk away if you need to grab snacks or water for the stay. The restaurant in the hotel is on the pricier side but delicious! Breakfast was buffet style and is 200 MAD.    Definitely would stay here again if we get to go back to Marrakech.

La Maison Arabe exceeded any expectations I may have had. The design was beautiful.. The attention to detail by the entire team was outstanding. The service was amazing!    We began our stay with a refreshing glass of juice (just calling it juice diminishes the beauty and flavor it was great) in the beautiful courtyard. We then enjoyed the services of the Hammam at their spa. This is a ""must do"" especially after our flight (we had a seven hour delay in Paris but that is another story). Walk into the spa and take a deep breathe; instant relaxation due to the calming fragrances.    My husband and I ate in the jazz bar our first night and listened to the most magnificent lute playing I ever heard (I wish I knew the gentleman's name so I could give him the flowers he deserved).    The food just awesome. For breakfast those Moroccan pancakes are addictive (although they have the normal breakfast offerings which are just as good)! In the evening my husband and I ate in our room on the second night istening to the music from our terrace. Room service food is the same as the restaurant (just as great).

The Riad sits in a perfect location slightly out of the craziness of the souks but just a short walk away.The entire staff was super welcoming and helpful often going out of their ways to assist us.    The rooms (we stayed two separate weekends) we both fantastic. Plenty of space so much beautiful and intiricate art throughout the whole building.    The food was fantastic. We loved having breakfast by the pool eating delicious Moroccan pancakes with nutella and sipping coffee. We had dinner pool side and everything was A+ from service to the food.    We were lucky enough to indulge in a hammam and massage while we were there. It was truly and out of body experience. Soo relaxing and just what the doctor ordered after walking around the souks all day.    We had a blast at the cooking school and are excited to try our hand at Moroccan food back home. Hasna was fantastic.    Special shout out to Adil the front desk manager. He was incredibly helpful the whole time we were there. From checking on our lost luggage with the airport to arranging COVID tests pre-departure to calling and making reservations and any restaurant we asked him to.

La Maison Arabe,Travel all you can wrote a review Oct 2021,50,An outstanding stay...,Where to begin?    La Maison Arabe is an incredible boutique hotel which manages to achieve great service (maintaining a personal touch) within a truly stunning traditional Moroccan backdrop that does not disappoint.    From the moment you are welcomed until your final farewell the staff make you feel fully at home always and nothing feels like too much. Whether you need to make a reservation need recommendations require a taxi (and support with the inevitable price negotiation) or simply want to chat it will always feel seamless natural and enjoyable when engaging with the team at the hotel.    The hotel is essentially a number of riads which have been purchased and then joined together. So it’s a maze of stairs corridors and rooms which adds to the traditional feel and the overall experience. Our room a suite (a complementary upgrade which was very welcomed) was spectacular with a large bathroom and an amazing terrace with a view overlooking the pool and main restaurant. This was probably the best view in the hotel and at night with the traditional Moroccan music ambient lighting and the chatter of people dining was really a sight to behold. The room had a mini bar which was well stocked and not ridiculously priced however they did charge for nespresso pods which was a first for us. Not excessive but a little unusual as coffee is usually free in the room.    The restaurant service was excellent and the food exquisite. A minor observation on the first evening could be made on the speed of the waiter service but this is Morocco and a relaxed pace should be expected. We had dinner twice during our stay and would thoroughly recommend it.    Breakfast was a buffet style with an egg station and a separate pancake station. The service was again excellent however our personal preference is towards a table service style of breakfast and the buffet took away some of the charm which you come to look forward to when visiting Marrakesh. Again this is a personal preference and it shouldn’t detract from the overall experience or expectation.    The room was serviced daily and there was a turn down service which is always good to see. The laundry service was also reasonably priced and efficient. Everything felt very clean and there were no concerns during our stay on this front.    The hotel is well located within easy reach of both the ‘new’ town outside the town walls and the main souk area. Taxis were easy to catch and all drivers know the location of the hotel which is helpful. The hotel warned us about a current scam involving people pretending to work for the hotel approaching you in the street and claiming to be off duty before striking up a conversation and then trying to scam you. I can confirm we had a few attempts ourselves so do be mindful of this! It usually starts with someone coming up to you and saying ‘Remember me I work in your riad’.  We spent half a day at the country club which is part of the hotel and approximately 15 minutes away by hotel shuttle. The shuttle runs daily on the hour and also provides the return journey.    We were extremely fortunate to have the country club to ourselves for the entirety of our time there with full use of the pool along with lunch and bar service. A special thank you to Mohammed who provided excellent personal service and ensured we were very well looked after. Lunch was excellent and you can charge to the room as if you were in the hotel.    A visit to the country club is an absolute must if staying at the hotel!  Overall an excellent stay with top notch service and amazing amenities.

La Maison Arabe,james s wrote a review Aug 2021,50,A gem in the heart of Marrakesh,This riad is stunning. There is a truly dedicated and welcoming team. Not only is the hotel beautiful but it has a warmth that makes staying here a pleasure. Small and intimate is often better than a large and sometimes impersonal hotel. Not to forget the restaurant! A destination location for many people it augmented my stay enormously. I enjoyed many amazing meals in the restaurant and in my room. The setting is stunning as it’s next to the pool.  There are many other features including a cooking school hammam and a second very private beautiful swimming pool situated in a gorgeous garden (with food available) 15 minutes from the hotel (well worth the hotel shuttle ride!)  At some point during my two-week trip to Morocco (arranged with the excellent tour company Gateway2Morroco) I contracted a breakthrough case of Covid. Fortunately the symptoms were mild. I chose to extend my stay. The management and staff did everything to accommodate my quarantine. Besides offering a “covid” rate they brought meals to my room helped arrange testing facilitated airline reservations and even provided daily “therapeutic” drinks to help me recover. I’d be remiss not to mention the support of Mourad truly an amazing person at the front desk. Mourad was available every day asking how I felt and offering useful and supportive suggestions. So if you want to be in a great and authentic location with excellent service (near the Koutoubia Mosque and Jemaa-el-Fna) this is it.,Date of stay: August 2021,,"Princeton, New Jersey",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamessY5953MV

Their pool is clean and quite big their spa treatments are at a very fair price and is so beautiful.    They even offer dinner at the hotel it's so good that even people staying outside the hotel come have dinner here.

La Maison Arabe,Noelle A wrote a review May 2021,50,Highly recommend - had a wonderful stay,This accomodation was my favourite (out of the 7 different places we stayed at on this trip).    Rooms - very clean with a luxurious yet traditional feel. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a junior suite and the room was very large with a separate sitting area and a private terrace overlooking the pool.    Service - was excellent. Staff were so attentive and personable and must have been briefed prior to our arrival because they all seemed to be across where we were from and our room no. etc from the moment we got there. Such personal service that made us feel like we were important!    Food - blew me away. Their lamb cous cous was so yum (had it 3 times) and their non-moroccon menu is also great quality. Their restaurant must be very well known as lots of non hotel guests came to the hotel just for dining. Breakfast was really good too - there was a lady making traditional looking pancakes every morning over an outdoor stove.

This hotel is one of the best places I have ever stayed.    The staff go out of their way for you they are amazing! We especially enjoyed the complimentary mint tea provided at certain times of the day. This is also a culinary hotel so the food here was by far the best we had in Morocco.    The food is top notch and cooked to perfection. Not only was this a traditional experience it was luxurious and the restaurant in the hotel was our favorite meal of the trip.    Our room was beautiful the decor will make you want to copy it! Our suite was stunning spacious clean and styled impeccably with Moroccan decor.    They also offer tours that I would most definitely recommend.

The property is beautiful the room was quite lovely and the historic restaurant first class. The staff were extremely friendly and competent and made us feel immediately at home.  As a riad in the Medina it was within easy walking distance of all the main attractions of Marrakech something that the larger resort hotels can't offer. An added bonus is their country club which is a beautiful desert retreat. The riad has an hourly shuttle that services the country club perfect for a relaxing pool day or you can as we usually did enjoy the large pool at the main property to cool off after a day visiting one of the local tourist sites.,Date of stay: March 2020,,"Kelowna, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kelowna2736

The service was second to none. The food was delicious. The breakfast had so many options. Including fresh yogurt and fruit juices including orange carrot beet and more. My room was huge and my bed had rose petals on it. We got free a small bottle of Moroccan wine and a large bottle of water in our room. And they sent us off to airport with a small bottle of water and a small box of delicious pastries. I loved walking around the hotel to discover its beautiful windows doors and ceilings. We had a Hamamm included in our package and it was divine. I was scrubbed head to toe then had a massage in the beautiful spa. Our last night we had a Moroccan tangine cooking class followed by a wonderful dinner of our creations. We were able to exchange cash or exchange our MADs for smaller bills and send a postcard. There is an ATM nearby. It’s really a top notch service hotel. The location is good but hotel entrance is in alleyway that is not very attractive but we always felt safe. .

From the entry off a narrow alleyway to every detail inside the Arabe is simply wonderful. A harmonious melding of an old building with a newer one the hotel is beautifully and imaginatively decorated and lit in traditional Moroccan style. There are 2 restaurants (both excellent) a lovely interior court yard where tea is served a warren of comfortable nooks and crannies in which to sit read or converse a pool a hammam spa (also excellent) and a bar where soft jazz is played nightly.  The staff is top notch -- always helpful hospitable and extremely competant.  Every room is individually decorated. As it was our anniversary we were upgraded to a spacious and elegant suite which we enjoyed immensely. Others guests we spoke with told us their rooms and/or suites were beautiful and extremely comfortable as well.  This hotel is a bit of a splurge but in my opinion well worth it.

We took a class in the cooking school and each did treatments at the Hammam. Everything was absolutely top notch. The man who works at the front desk each day is amazing.

We splashed out on a Royal Suite with its own roof terrace and jacuzzi two bathrooms and tons of space. No views sadly but that's standard in the city centre in a riad. The place is crammed with beautiful objects from the previous owner's collectionssome of the public rooms with leather clad walls and the poolside dining comes into its own see my review of the restaurant. Breakfasts are also very good with lots of choice. The staff are really helpful Raja Rashida Moran and Aziz in the restaurant to name just a few. They got us taxis and agreed the price for us. Book La Majorelle with the front desk it avoids the queues.

La Maison Arabe,Caplawerne wrote a review Feb 2020,50,Exceeded our expectations,We spent a long time on Internet looking for a Hotel in Marrakech that met all our expectations mainly those of excellent Marokkan food and an ambiance that had the flair of the Orient. We were really lucky to find Maison Arabe that had it all plus in walking distance to the Souks and other places we wanted to see. We were deeply impressed by the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff and more than pleasantly surprised with the beauty and comfort of our suite. We had the best lamb we ever ate anywhere else and only ventured once to eat elsewhere during the entire 4 day stay it just could not have been better. We enjoyed the easy transport from and to the Airport and were indeed surprised that the location in the midst of the Medina had been so very quiet. If ever we come back to Marrakesh the Maison Arabe is the place were we would want to be. Last but not least the variety of the breakfast buffet left nothing to wish for.,Date of stay: January 2020,,"Marbella, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Caplawerne
La Maison Arabe,Jane C wrote a review Jan 2020,50,Holiday of a lifetime,This hotel is authentically Moroccan in style with beautiful decorative details throughout. The photos really don’t do it justice. The roomsfood and facilities are first class.The care that the staff take to ensure every element of your stay is perfect goes above and beyond anything I have experienced in 5 star hotels. Particular praise must go to Raja who was always exceptionally helpful and efficient on the front desk-even sharing my taxi on her way home to show me where the shopping mall was. Adil Chanif also on the front deskarranged for my mattress and pillows to be changed as I found the synthetic filling too hot. The beauty therapists in the spa gave me a wonderful hammam and the best pedicure I have ever had-my polish still looks perfect a month later! Finally the cookery school lesson  led by Souad is an experience I will always treasure.She was knowledgable patient and brought the whole group together over tagine making. The hotel manager even opened the gift shop on my last night so I could purchase some last minute presents. And Abdul the waiter always had time for a chat-especially about my midnight swim on New Years Eve!  I really can’t compliment the staff enough-they made my holiday so special I cried when I had to leave!  If you want a beautiful typically Moroccan riad within the city walls so everything is in walking distance and service of the highest level choose this one.

La Maison Arabe,flowerdesun wrote a review Jan 2020,20,Not worth it for the price - pool too cold to swim,I chose this hotel (it’s more of a hotel than a riad) as they had a heated swimming pool. I have enjoyed heated outdoor pools during winter months in my travels so I emailed the hotel specifically to confirm this. However it was barely heated and certainly not enough to swim- the front desk staff who gave me a tour concurred stating “yes too cold to swim” - the weather was mild at 62degrees with full sun but the pool is in the shade and not heated enough. What a disappointment!    The junior suite was ok but not five star. It has the old world charm but lacks any personal touch. The patio faces little courtyard but you are directly facing other rooms and no views so I don’t imagine ever spending time there. The courtyards are small therefore don’t expect the typical Moroccan airy courtyards that are so charming. The furniture in the courtyards are generic type with plain cheap cushions- no charm whatsoever.    Breakfast was just ok. I am glad I didn’t have to pay for it (22 euro). For the less than half the price you can definitely find a much better charming riads in this wonderful city - one of my favorites in the world.  Positives are: incredible bed linens - that’s 5 star for sure!

La Maison Arabe,Bontaks wrote a review Jan 2020,50,"Authentic, atmospheric, outstanding!",La Maison Arabe is one of the finest hotels in Marrakech not only due to the five star luxury in every element of its presentation and service but because of its history and authenticity. It is an Escher painting maze of steps and corridors with stunning rugs furniture and a seamless combination of Moorish and Islamic architecture.    Upon arrival Hakim ushered us down terracotta brick stairs to the patio where we were treated to a cool mint pineapple juice and ginger welcome drink – refreshing and consumed in an instant! The patio has a central water feature of azure tiles and a flower-filled marble bowl providing a subtle gurgle and splash of water. Cushioned sofas and chairs for guests’ leisure furnish each corner and is where afternoon tea is enjoyed while a musician plucks a gimbri (a lute-like instrument also known as a sintir or hajhuj).  Before being shown to our room we were given a tour of the riad by Hakim whose calm demeanour and ability to pre-empt our needs would become a valued and familiar component of our stay. Due to the nature of the creation of this property (with additional rooms being added through the purchase of neighbouring buildings) there is a blend of intimacy and grandeur that I’d not experienced before in a hotel.    Downstairs is a hammam and spa offering a full range of traditional and contemporary treatments and a small but well-equipped gym. Via the reception and another flight of stairs there is Le Restaurant (one of the best in the city) and a pool that is part of the courtyard that houses the restaurant (at the time of visit Trois Saveurs was undergoing renovation). There is also a piano jazz bar that has live music from 7pm each evening and excellent cocktails and Asian inspired tapas. I particularly like the ‘morojito’ unique to the hotel – choice of gin or vodka or rum (I went with rum) with mint ginger lime and pineapple juice.    Hakim’s tour culminated in the opening of the door to our junior suite with patio view a serendipitous upgrade. The small but fine entry hall flowed into the living area a long room with a wall of panelled glass and double doors onto the private balcony that looked down into the central patio area. There was an historical tiled fireplace in the corner but it was hard to imagine it being used when visiting in summer! Our king sized bed stood in the wood and leather panelled room on thick red woollen rugs covering the Mudejar brick floors. The green and white marble ensuite contained a full bath and shower twin basins and bidet and toilet. Voluminous heavy red and white tapestry-like drapes gathered into folds held in place by gigantic silky white tassels that blocked out the morning light for those wishing to sleep in. Both rooms had airconditioning which is much needed in a Moroccan summer (although the temperatures were pleasant during our stay in June). The king bed was super comfortable and the soft white bedding was embroidered in gold with the logo of the hotel – ‘La Maison Arabe’ written in balletic beautiful Arabic.    Fresh roses adorned the room deep velvety red just beginning to open thickly bunched in a bulbous black vase; their scent was intoxicating. The floral theme of the classic rose was evident throughout the hotel; graceful generous long-stemmed white bunches in tall vases in the hallway perfectly lit as though they were priceless works of art with the warm carved wood behind them a shadowed and textured backdrop for their beauty.    A sumptuous buffet breakfast was provided each morning. The extensive display included many vegetable and salad offerings for the vegetarians as well as the usual array of hot food soups cheeses meats pastries and cereals. There were two stations set up on the terrace by the pool – one for traditional Moroccan crepes and another for any egg dish you could want. The staff at these stations cheerfully touted their tasty offerings enthusing guests and making a decision difficult. Luckily we were staying for three breakfasts and would be able to sample it all!    This hotel is authentic providing a singular luxurious and memorable experience for all guests but it was the delightful staff that fulfilled all of our needs with charm and care that made us feel at home. I loved observing their moments of connection with each other a clear sign of people happy in the workplace – the chat at the breakfast omelette and crepe stations the giggles between girls cleaning the stairs. Such joy is infectious and a tonic to travellers in search of rejuvenation! It was surprisingly difficult to farewell Hakim a prince of a concierge who had taken care of us from the moment we arrived ensuring each day that we had all that we desired and providing excellent suggestions for how to spend our time including arranging an outstanding guide for a tour of the city. Hakim even filled out our airport departure cards for us and presented us with a copy of the glossy recipe book for sale in the hotel’s homewares store. Blessed with gifts experiences of a lifetime and basking in Moroccan hospitality we reluctantly left our riad for the next leg of our journey determined to return to Marrakech to continue our love affair with one of the most charismatic cities of our travels.

La Maison Arabe,lizaeth22 wrote a review Jan 2020,40,Atmospheric stay in a great location,We spent 6 nights at this hotel on our first visit to Marrakech. Our initial suite was quite dark/atmospheric and looked out onto a small courtyard beautiful in the middle of the day but very messy once the local bird life had spent a couple of hours in the tree there.

La Maison Arabe offers luxurious Moroccan decor and spacious updated bathrooms. Everywhere you turned it looked like a photograph from Architectural Digest. There are displays of sweet Moroccan oranges everywhere.    Food is absolutely delicious. The hotel is known worldwide for its cooking school. We so enjoyed our poolside dinner in the interior courtyard as well as our breakfast there. Tea was served upon arrival.    Well-Located inside the medina and easily accessible near its edge. There have been additions over the years and there are stairs in many directions. I was happy that we had requested a room near the elevator.

La Maison Arabe,Sameer wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Luxury nestled in the beautiful Medina of Marrakech,Marrakech and La Maison Arabe was the last stop of our Moroccco trip and it was definitely one of the best experiences we had in Morocco.    The boutique hotel is actually a Riad that has been repurposed into a luxury boutique hotel complete with a heated pool spa and hammam jazz bar and a couple of restaurants (of which one wasn’t working though)    The approach roads to LMA are quite nondescript and quite underwhelming. But once inside you cannot help bring transfixed with the elegance and royal old world charm of the place. Our room was quite spacious had a nice balcony and the bathroom was quite nice too (it didn’t have shower only room though). There were enough windows to keep open at night if you are into fresh air rather than aircon and there was a TV set too (which doesn’t seem common in Riads)    The service was in general very very good; whether at the spa at the restaurants or for room service (only reason I wouldn’t call it excellent is that the Steward who introduced us to the hotel its facilities and our room forgot to send us the power point adapter to charge our phones). As a special mention the hotel reception took pains to locate a pharmacy on a Sunday went and checked that it was actually open and then brought me over on a two wheeler to buy some medicine for my wife who was feeling unwell.

La Maison Arabe,Quasimime wrote a review Nov 2019,50,An excellent place to stay with great service,"I had two separate experiences at La Maison Arabe both excellent and my favourite in Marrakech.    First I attended a cooking class hosted by Yomna and dada Fatiha. It was a great experience and an enjoyable way to learn more about Moroccan cuisine and culture. The kitchen its appliances and instructional tools (e.g. monitor at each station) were top-notch but most of all Yomna and Fatiha made everything fun.    After visiting other parts of Morocco I returned to Marrakech and had the privilege of staying at La Maison Arabe for a couple days. I was lucky enough to be upgraded to a suite spread across two floors plus a rooftop terrace with a jacuzzi. The bed was super comfortable the showers and tubs had plenty of hot water and good water pressure and the couches were comfortable - a rarity in the other places I stayed. Another rarity compared to the other places I stayed in Morocco? The suite's temperature control was great and I finally felt warm at night (my stay was in the beginning of winter).    The service is exceptional! From check-in to check-out the staff was attentive and exceptional. The man who checked us in and provided a a tour of the interconnected and lovely buildings that make up the property was fantastic and super friendly. There are two on-site restaurants; the food and service were great - and I had some of my favourite meals in Morocco at ""Les Trois Saveurs"" its international restaurant. Visited the hamman for a treatment which was AMAZING.    The location was great and it's very easy to walk to so many interesting sites.    Everything about my stay was exceptional and it's easy to see why La Maison Arabe has achieved a legendary status in Marrakech and it'll be my first choice when I visit Marrakech again.

Management must be applauded because this level of service and attentiveness does not happen by accident. Rooms were impecably clean and redone everyday. Service was personal and attentive. The Hammam was outstanding clean and refreshing. The Restuarant and staff were “on it” and service was top notch. They have an off-site pool that sounds like a weird idea until you get there and then it is such an oasis of calm and it is literally 10-15 minutes from the hotel. Finally I would be remiss if I did not mention two people that made me feel at home. Rasheeda who manages the Restuarant (and it appears other things): she made me feel welcome and she was attentive to all the guests and theirs questions. Finally Maurad. He is the afternoon and night manager who knew where to go how to go how much to pay and frankly he often knew where I wanted to go before I did but was patient enough to listen to me fumble through my questions. When we travel we always look for that one person that “is on our side” and makes us feel like he is protecting your stay. Maurad is that person. Go to Marrakech and stay at Maison Arab.

The staff were incredibly helpful and kind thoughout our stay arranging everything from a very competent guide to cooking classes and excellent massages.    The food was excellent as well and much better priced than some of the other fancy restaurants we visited... And the rooms overall ambiance and beautiful interior were unique and authentically Moroccan. Even the workout facility was designed in Moroccan style and pretty good.    You can spend a lot more money at Mamounia the Royal Mansour or the Four Seasons but you won’t have a better experience than at Maison Arabe.

La Maison Arabe,atiriarte wrote a review Jul 2019,50,"Stunning property, amazing food, decent service.",Before our stay at La Maison Arabe we were couchsurfing in the UK in the apartment of a few friends so we decided to splurge for four nights here. No regrets! We were upgraded to a massive room with a separate living area. The room came with a decent mini bar which we never availed of and a complementary bottle of wine which was a nice touch. The in-house restaurant was fab and the free breakfast every morning was amazing and probably my favorite thing about our entire stay. The pool area which is just off the restaurant is perfect also. Small but suitable for the property; would have been nice if it was temperature controlled as it was cold the two-times we swam but perhaps this is intentional to help cool you off from the Moroccan heat. The hotel was also very nice and arranged two tours for us: 1) walking tour around the city literally 30mins after we checked-in and 2) a day trip to Essaouira. We didn't use the hammam in the hotel as it was a bit pricey compared to others outside but it was stunning nonetheless and is worth visiting if only to admire its beauty. If I ever find myself back in Marrakech La Maison Arabe will be at the top of my list. Only downside is no elevator and stairs are steep; not an issue for me but may be for individuals with disabilities or the elderly.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Guam, Mariana Islands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/atiriarte

The hotel is truly 5 star and nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff - which actually is what makes it. Had meal at the hotel on my birthday (steak is brilliant) and the staff sang to me with a candle in a cake! Perfect location to explore close to other restaurants and the souk. We made the most of the country club and visited it a number of times we ate there at lunch too the staff were just great. We visited in June/July temperature around 34 degrees. We didn't use the hotel pool as it's surrounded by the restaurant so you can't really sit around it but didn't need to getting to the country club is so easy 10 - 15mins away by a bus put on by the hotel not what I'd wanted at all but actually it was lovely.

La Maison Arabe,pepsiboi wrote a review Jul 2019,50,"Amazing stay, amazing property, amazing staff",I just returned from 7 nights at La Maison Arabe. A big part of what made my trip to Marrakech such an epic adventure was a lovely stay in the Ali Baba suite at this beautiful hotel. The moment you walk down the narrow walkway to the entrance of the property you know you are in for something special and unique. The way the riad has grown over the years makes it quite an adventure to find your way around for the first day or two but then everything starts to make sense. I highly recommend you visit the fitness area - if not to work out just to see the amazing architecture - it was my favorite part of the hotel. Also a treatment in the spa is a must-do beautiful space with a relaxed atmosphere and caring and knowledgeable staff. Of course the restaurant is also incredible. It has such a great reputation that many people come from outside the hotel to eat here so be sure to make a reservation in advance (although seeing that you are staying there they are always able to fit you in). And breakfast was a winner - huge selection of fresh fruit salads and hot food (insider's tip - try the scrambled eggs not sure why they are so delicious but they are so delicious!). It is difficult to name all the amazing staff but I will share with you three members that went above and beyond as I was trying to plan a surprise for my partner's birthday. Mr Abdelouahed from engineering Mr Braham from food and beverage and Ms Raga from the front desk all took my unique request and figured out how to make it work surpassing my expectations - THANK YOU! This was a wonderful stay and I would highly recommend staying here you won't be disappointed.,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Bangkok,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pepsiboi

It was the greatest shame and in turn the general manager blamed us and accused us of threatening him as well as said that we were trying to extort the hotel. The general manager Taoufik Ghaffouli is the most pathetic coward i’ve ever seen. He is surely going to read this review and respond with something condescending. He in fact contacted Trip Advisor and had them delete the posts which my family members had posted in which they described their experience at this s*** hole hotel. I will follow this post with a scanned copy of the police report that my family and I filed with the Moroccan Police as well as a video I captured of Taoufik Ghaffouli being his true coward self and hurling insults at my family when we confronted him about his lies.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prithvigabhi13

La Maison Arabe,Traceyn27 wrote a review Jun 2019,50,Amazing hotel! Don’t miss the cooking class,This is a very unique quaint hotel in Marrakech. We had flown from Miami nonstop to Casablanca. Hotel assisted us with transportation and Yousef was great. A nice relaxing 2 hour 10 minute drive to the hotel. Train is also an option but generally runs late. We had preselected the Dalila room with a nice private balcony overlooking the tea courtyard. Room decor was beautiful and flower petals were all over. A nice fresh vase of roses was also in the room. Don’t miss the cooking class! We booked a 3 hour chicken tajine class where we learned the tajine and two traditional side dishes that we then enjoyed with our group. The class started with a tea making class discussion on spices and then a quick tour of the local baker where everyone takes their bread daily to have baked. The step by step class was a great hands on experience not to be missed. Also check out the spa and try the traditional Hamman with a massage.

We stayed 2 nights went to different cities and came back again for the last day before our departure back home.    The entrance is not by the road but by an alleyway. Upon entering your greeted with  very professional and helpful staff. They helped us get cabs every time. And gave us champagne and treats in our room. The hotel and a quaint courtyard that offered afternoon tea. The hotel is also a restaurant that apparently was Winston Churchill’s favorite place. The whole place is definitely luxurious yet also traditional in decor and feel. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. My only one complaint is our first suite was next to a mosque which they had loud prayers at 5AM in the morning everyday. So if this bothers you consider asking to be in the newer end of the hotel which was our second room after coming back the last day. Overall great service and feel!

They take you through the preparation and confluence of spices and vegetables for chicken tagine and in my case vegetarian tagine and gave very clear explanation all throughout. You finish with lunch in a beautiful indoor courtyard to the sound of a Moroccan guitar and leave with a gift of clay tagine and recipes on cards. Highly recommend for a unique and value packed cooking experience.,Date of stay: June 2019,,"Saint Louis, Missouri",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chasmore52

The Riad is beautifully designed with character throughout very comfortable and very quiet given how noisy/busy the city can be. The room was very comfortable and quiet as well. Great rooftop deck for breakfast.    The Riad is in a great location walking distance to almost everything we did.

La Maison Arabe,Michael A. Jacobs wrote a review Jun 2019,50,Perfect Hotel,My wife and I stayed at LMA for three nights. We loved it. Our room which overlooked the courtyard was spacious comfortable well-appointed and quiet. The breakfast was ample and delicious (ask for the Moroccan pancake with almond butter). The hotel is conveniently located in the Médina. We were also shuttled — only 15 minutes away — to their resort which was gorgeous.    Most importantly the staff was terrific: friendly knowledgeable and helpful. Vignette: we made a 9:30 dinner reservation at the fabulous on-prem restaurant then called down to see if we could dine earlier. We were called back twice: first to ask us if we wanted to eat indoors (no the poolside setting is too beautiful) and then when a table opened up early.

But we ended up staying for a whole week & it turned up to be a fairy one.. We even celebrated our wedding anniversary the whole thing was magically splendid !  We fell in love with each other all over again as we fell in love with the idyllic place.  The architecture made us feel immersed in the ancient history of Morocco.. It is literally an authentic hotel for many reasons ;  Withing the bustle & the hustle of the old Medina we enjoyed the calmness inside the hotel... There were many areas where to chill & relax indoors... Our suite was supremely comfortable... The beds & the rooms were so cozy... The stuff were super nice & professional too... We felt more safe inside of the hotel despite all noise & risks known in down town old Medina... The food was extremely delicious... By some evenings we enjoyed the playing symphony of a talented pianist who entertained us in the cozy jazz bar...  Briefly we were treated as royalty !  Every tiny detail wasn't missed no wonder why *La Maison Arabe* is ranked among top of most luxurious hotels !

La Maison Arabe,jtellez09 wrote a review May 2019,50,Fantastic and beautifully designed property with excellent service,La Maison Arabe is a beautiful riad/hotel in the medina. The design will take your breath away - there are so many gorgeous ornate details! The medina is a hectic overwhelming place but La Maison Arabe is a true oasis within it.    The staff is truly fantastic and will go out of their way to make you feel at home. They are always friendly always smiling and always helpful. Three examples from our stay:  1) Our room wasn't ready when we arrived at 9am. They offered us complimentary breakfast and had the room ready by the time we finished breakfast.  2) My husband's back was hurting but we were scheduled to do a cooking class so didn't have time to go to a pharmacy. While we were at cooking class (arranged by La Maison Arabe and highly recommended by the way!) the staff went out to purchase pain medicine for my husband and delivered it to us in the cooking class.  3) When we departed they provided us with pre-filled out departure forms for customs (brilliant! I've never had a hotel do that before) plus a Moroccan cookbook. Such a nice touch!    The property itself is a bit of a maze so may take you a few tries to find your room on the first couple of days. Our room was a standard king room and while it wasn't exceedingly large or luxurious there were lots of small touches that made it wonderful. The design was gorgeous and authentic there was a free bottle of wine and rose petals when we arrived the bathroom had a heated floor and the shower had great water pressure. There is a gym (which most of the smaller riads lack) a rooftop lounge and several beautiful courtyards to hang out in.    The breakfast was fantastic and we enjoyed the beautiful ambiance in the courtyard for dinner. We also loved afternoon tea which included Moroccan pastries and mint tea with live music.    We visited Royal Mansour the most luxurious hotel in the medina and while it was gorgeous we much preferred La Maison Arabe and found the service to be much better. It was 1/8th of the price - an unbeatable value! It is probably within my top 10 hotels that I've ever stayed at and I've spent at least 900 nights in hotels over the last 10 years!,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Atlanta, Georgia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jtellez09

The riad-hotel itself is very well kept I was traveling with my best friend and we both loved our room and found the bed and pillows heavenly.

La Maison Arabe,Paraic Joyce wrote a review May 2019,50,A hotel others should model themselves on,We took a 3 day trip from Dublin to Marrakech last week and were fortunate to have picked La Mason Arabe as our base for the weekend. This is a traditional riad at the edge of the central souks which has subtlety added some of life’s modern comforts with style and class - a gym a spa and a modern Moroccan cookery school built into the original architecture of a facility which has expanded over the years. The breakfast was an amazing buffet of fresh fruits and somewhat less healthy but absolutely delicious local pastries (I’m guessing made in house). The egg station served omelettes and traditional Moroccan pancakes - the latter of which everyone needs to experience once in their lives. We ate in the international restaurant on our last night by the pool. There are two menus an international and a Moroccan one and you can “mix and match”. (There’s also a Moroccan restaurant indoors but when it’s 42 degrees and you’re Irish you ain’t sitting inside!). Both the food and ambiance are outstanding (as is the Moroccan wine though La Maison can’t take full credit for that!). There are 26 rooms - we were upgraded to a suite for some lucky reason which included a private rooftop terrace where afternoon tea was delivered each day.    And then there were the staff. These people could give a lesson in hospitality. We weren’t left wanting for anything from comforts in the riad itself to information about where to go and how to get there. On our last day we were given a room free of charge to shower and change before we got our late flights. And all of this was during Ramadan at 42 degrees!    Marrakech is a great place to visit one in your life. If you stay in La Maison Arabe you’ll probably want to go back. I know I will.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paraicjoyce70

My guests ordered from the Moroccan side and were delighted by the selection of Moroccan salads the ""briouates"" (mini filo pastry savoury starters) to start with and the quality of the lamb and various tagines as main courses. I chose the Western rack of lamb and was equally pleased.  The music/musicians really create a local atmosphere.

La Maison Arabe,SoFlaGoddess wrote a review May 2019,50,Magical Marrakech,"La Maison Arabe is a gem in the beautiful city of Marrakech. To digress a little for anyone who hasn't been to Marrakech and is considering going: go. After landing at the most beautiful airport I've ever seen (and I'm an architect) we wound our way in a cab through a surprisingly lush clean exotic city to the Maison Arabe. (Note: the hotel can arrange airport pick-up.)  La Maison Arabe is centrally located near most of the main attractions and the souk which is within a 10 minute walk. The hotel is authentic and charming and makes you feel right at home upon arrival. Guests almost don't need to leave the property which offers two restaurants a bar/jazz club pool and a grotto-like hammam spa. The main restaurant is particularly beautiful due to its location surrounding the pool in a courtyard with lush foliage and bright flowers that attract song birds. You can also take a shuttle to their ""country club"" property about 20 minutes away which has a restaurant and a larger pool.  Throughout the property you feel like you're in the Arabian Nights. Each of the comfortably-sized rooms are unique decorated with beautiful Moroccan furniture rugs light fixtures and gorgeous carved wooden doors. The bathrooms are works of art covered in mosaic tiles with arched walls and a large tiled tub and shower. The linens are luxurious and the beds are wonderfully comfortable (made it hard to get out of bed in the morning). It looks like most or all of the rooms have outdoor patios with privacy screens.  The hotel staff were all wonderful and helpful whenever we needed anything.  We loved everything about La Maison Arabe and can't wait to return to the hotel and to beautiful Marrakech.",Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Miami, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoFlaGoddess

La Maison Arabe,Darren P1968 wrote a review Apr 2019,50,Excellent - again !,This is the second time we have stayed here which is pretty rare for us and it was as good if not better than last time.    The manager Adil and his staff are brilliant and assist you all they can.    We stayed 4 nights in a suite this time and it was great.    Plenty of space and a courtyard to relax in.    The bed was a tad hard but better that than soft.    We were warmly welcomed into the Maison and had water and wine in the room on arrival along with rose petals.    The really good thing about this place is that it’s moments from the action the main square shops and souks but a world away inside.    Afternoon tea is served daily with petit fours and they have a Moroccan chap playing a cross between a drum and a guitar quietly in the courtyard area of the hotel.    The brand is expanding as they have several shops nearby and they have the cooking school in a new looking building. It used to be in the hotel itself.    You eat near the pool which is heated. I haven’t ever seen anyone swim in it but it’s there.    The breakfasts are superb with fresh fruit juices teas coffees fresh breads pancakes made by the dadda’s cakes and buns galore as well as vegetables salad and cheeses. A real delight on a morning !    The country retreat of La Maison Arabe is the true gem.    20 minutes away from the busy City is a fabulous garden with swimming pool (not heated) lovely sun beds a large tent area and a shop/cooking school.    It’s really great and has staff so you can have a light meal get drinks etc.    They do seem to be building around the area but you really have to have a day there. The hotel runs a bus to and from regularly throughout the day.    All in all it has to be one of the top places to stay in Marrakech. We were woken by the call to prayer each morning but I suspect you would hear that anywhere in town.

La Maison Arabe,CAW wrote a review Apr 2019,50,A Perfect Oasis in Marrakech.,"We wanted a nice hotel with an authentic Moroccan feel and that's exactly what we got. La Maison Arabe is in a great location within a quick walk to the souk and convenient to many other attractions.  The hotel is an assemblage of several riads. The changes in levels and circuitous routes to get to the restaurants jazz bar (yes they have a jazz bar) pool spa etc. make it all the more charming. The design is so authentic with beautiful tile and wood work throughout as well as gorgeous colorful rugs art and decorative items. The small courtyard where they serve tea and sweets in the afternoon and the main one where the main restaurant and pool are located were overflowing with unbelievably lush foliage and bright flowering plants.  The facilities at the hotel and at their property outside of the city (I think they call it the ""Country Club"") were perfect too. The pool in the hotel which is in the courtyard in the middle of the restaurant was heated to near bathwater temperature which felt great since we were there in early April and the weather was still a bit chilly in the morning and evening. The Country Club has a larger pool an offers more privacy but the water is not heated so it might be best enjoyed in late Spring/Summer/early Fall. The spa is like Arabian Nights meets a grotto: dimly lit exotic and offering a feeling of seclusion. We thoroughly enjoyed our massages.  Our room was also perfect especially the large elaborately tiled bathroom with recessed arches. It was a good size with plenty of storage behind beautiful carved wood doors. The bed was very comfortable and the linens were of high quality. Our room (220) had a patio with a large wood door to close it off though I would expect every room is a little bit different. It was a pleasure to sit on the patio in the mornings and listen to the song birds flitting from one colorful flowering bush to another.  The staff was wonderful. They seemed to anticipate anything we could have wanted.  I can't recommend La Maison Arabe and Marrakech in general more.

The award winning restaurant does a great job in accommodating severe dietary restrictions (gluten and dairy) - I didn’t get sick once when I was there. I especially enjoyed their thai dishes as I was ready for a break from tajin! Their spa environment was magical and my husband and I enjoyed a romantic few days there including a couples hammam experience. He did get sick for a night after we ate dinner at the hotel but I think it was due to cumulative 10 days traveling and eating in Morocco. Customer service was good and they set us up with a strong tour guide. We weren’t as excited about the secret pool and garden which is another property offsite - we had been really looking forward to utilising this luxury but unfortunately even though it’s set up as an oasis there is a lot of road noise which distracted from the relaxation.

Facilities were beautiful clean and inviting. For those in Morocco seeking a place where all the staff are proficient in English this is your place. We began with the traditional welcome mint tea and cookies. We then proceeded to our cooking class. We made an amazing lunch of Tagine and multiple side dishes    The teacher was very knowledgeable and playful with the class. She was charming even when the participants asked ethnocentric to be kind questions of her. After cooking our food was taken to the rooftop where we dined. Very stunning environment.    Next my friend and I went to have a special Moroccan treat an afternoon at the Hammam or spa. This was the most unbelievable positive experience one could imagine. First we were asked to disrobe and provided bathrobes and led to the sofas to receive tea. Then we were taken into a steam room with marble platforms with soft thin padding on which to lie. Two women took black soap and proceeded to wash our bodies. After that we were exfoliated by them. Next we were washed again including our hair and then Moroccan Argan oil with scents we had chosen earlier. This was about a 45 minute process. We were then led back to the couches where we were asked to relax. After a few minutes we were guided into another room and massages for about another hour. It was an amazing and profoundly relaxing experience. The ambiance was gorgeous.

Just amazing...,As someone who is a globe trotter making Morocco my 96th country to travel to La Maison Arabe completely elevated my Marrakesh experience. Not only is the entire facility simply stunning visually in terms of design architecture & amenities it is the hospitality of the staff that takes it to the next level. From the moment I entered to the moment I left I truly felt welcomed...by the reception staff the spa personnel the bartenders waiters hostesses & everyone else working there. I couldn’t help feeling special while there.    This is also a great hotel for solo travelers since they have single rooms at a great price. The facility had two restaurants both friendly & with live music a wonderful heated pool setup & a jazz bar - there is plenty to do & lots of people to talk to. The location is also perfect - not far from the square Dar El Bacha or the City Tour hop on/hop off bus. The reception staff can organize tours for you at quick notice & are very knowledgeable in making recommendations for bars restaurants rooftops etc. They can even get you tickets in advance for touristic attractions like Jardin Majorelle so you don’t have to stand in line.    One particular shout out goes to Hakim who went above & beyond to make sure I was given good care during my stay - he was polite charming and so helpful. He’s a true role model for the hospitality industry world wide.    I can not recommend this hotel enough.

Thank you for your kind hearts!,We visited Marrakech for my birthday and I was looking forward to staying at La Maison Arabe as I remembered how beautiful the restaurant was when I visited last year. Unfortunately suffered horrible food poisoning at the previous place we stayed (Palais Namaskar) so were not in our best spirits when we arrived. However this all changed when we entered La Maison Arabe...you are greeted by beautiful oud smells and by such an amazing staff! It brings tears to my eyes at how wonderful they are! They honestly went above and beyond - from the porters the restaurant staff and to the front office manager Adil. They came to the room with a beautiful birthday cake as we were too sick to venture outside and when we were well to eat in the restaurant - they offered us the most delicious meals! The restaurant I must say is exquisite. Every sense is catered to - they have sourced the most talented musicians to accompany your meal which is super fresh and tasty. I loved the food so much that I actually ordered a takeaway for me to enjoy on the plane! Even for this request they packed the food in a nice container and also offered some cutlery.  Our room was really magical - it had old world charm and a wonderful balcony where you could look down at the pool.  Our flight was later in the day and we were not in the state to walk. The front office manager - Adil - actually gave us a room to rest before our flight! The generosity of this hotel and its staff knows no bounds.

La Maison Arabe,Meghan and Kim wrote a review Feb 2019,50,Highly Recommend,We really loved this hotel. It is worth it to spend the extra money to stay here over some of the less expensive hotels. The staff service and attention to detail set it apart. Wish we could have stayed longer but will definitely be back.    Location: It’s in a great location in the medina but away from too much congestion. Everything we wanted to see was within walking distance. We were woken up by the morning prayers playing through the medina around 7am but it is part of the experience. The location felt safe and secure.    Rooms: Clean; big comfortable beds; heated floors in bathroom; huge shower; lovely Moroccan décor; good views of the garden area.    Food: Breakfast was included and was a large buffet with a variety of options served by the pool/gardens from 7am to 11am. Complimentary tea is served every day from 3pm – 6pm with live music. There are a couple of restaurants and lounges on-site for dinner and drinks and are open until around 11pm/midnight. The restaurants served delicious Moroccan and international dishes. There was also complimentary water a bottle of wine and sweets in our room upon arrival.    On-Site Activities: On very short notice (a few hours) we wanted to book a cooking class and spa treatments but both were in very high demand so we were unable to attend. The concierge recommended and booked us our desired treatments at a spa just down the street. And we were gifted a cookbook from the cooking school when we checked out.    Staff: SO friendly and helpful and remembered us from day to day. They really went above and beyond. We had also mistakenly reserved one extra night during booking. The hotel did not charge us for the extra night and rearranged our airport transfer without hesitation. Just really great customer service.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Boston, Massachusetts",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meghanandkim

The hotel has a saying you are at ""Chez Vous"" This is their culture and they do it well. Most organizations strive to get to this level of quality but are not consistent. Without exception and in a very nonintrusive way we were made to feel at home. Friendly helpful concerned aware and just wonderful. My list is not inclusive and when I say the entire staff I really do mean that the staff was universally welcoming. Here are a few of the many who made us feel at home. I wish I could list all of them. Adil Brahim Rachida Abdessamad Fadwa Marouane. The Riad is intimate. The rooms are incredibly comfortable and beautifully decorated as is the entire hotel. Public spaces were welcoming and arranged comfortably to make you feel at home encouraging relaxation and conversation. The restaurants offered delicious traditional and international dishes. The breakfast was bountiful. The pool and the poolside restaurant was a sanctuary.

There is a terrace on the roof for reading (or a bottle wine) and a jazz bar with a mixologist who is talented and a lot of fun. Just tell him what liquor and flavors you like and he will whip you up his own original. If you like gin try his invention ""The Sunflower."" Service is terrific with the desk people very nice and helpful and wanting to ensure your stay is great. You are greeted with green tea in a nice room with birds singing. We did not have time for a hammam but it looked like it was well worth the money. Breakfast by the pool with plenty of variety and a cook on standby to whip up the eggs.

Throughout my stay the team were incredibly gracious hosts and always ensured you were well looked after.    I booked in a hammam during my stay. It was so fantastic that I booked a second treatment the following week when I intended to come back through the city.

La Maison Arabe,Sean Hummel wrote a review Jan 2019,50,A historic Riad in Marrakech - not to be missed!,We stayed at La Maison Arabe on two separate occasions while traveling in Morocco. Our first stay at the Riad was so excellent we decided we had to come back!    We spent New Years Eve at the Riad for 2019 and had an excellent time. We purchased a table for dinner that evening and were entertained through the night be music dancers a few surprises and of course an excellent meal! It was an NYE to remember!    This Riad is a historic one in Marrakech and is actually the first Riad in the City. They started with the most famous restaurant in the city and over time grew to the Riad they are today. Expect 5-star service with this Riad. They treat you like royalty and cater to any request you may have. It is an experience you will not forget. The property is exquisite and ornately decorated. There is a lovely courtyard where you can enjoy afternoon tea accompanied by live music. There is an intimate jazz bar where live piano music plays every night as you sip on delicious cocktails. There are two restaurants within the Riad. Both of them excellent and deserve a visit. There is a heated pool which was very nice when we stayed in January. The Spa is out of the world!!! We visited the spa three times and we would highly recommend getting a hamam there! They also offer cooking classes and are very famous for them in the city - Highly recommend it! Also there is an offsite countryclub area that has a private pool and sundeck for Riad guests only.    Both of the rooms we stayed in far exceeded our expectations. They were spacious spotless and very comfortable. The all had a TV fridge wardrobe heat/ac and a very nice bed! Also the wifi was strong/fast and worked everywhere. The breakfast buffet was delicious!!    We particularly liked all the hidden little sitting areas throughout the Riad. The place is very big and has many hallways that allow you to get lost exploring. It was such a romantic stay and we could not recommend this place enough! If you can't stay here than definitiely come and eat at one of the restaurants... you wont regret it!    Special thanks to Adil and all the staff that helped to make our stay extra special.

It is located in the old city just a few minutes walk to the markets yet it was quiet and serene. We also enjoyed the spa!

La Maison Arabe,R.A. wrote a review Dec 2018,50,Stop searching and book this hotel now!,"Truly impressed by this hotel and that's rare because I am a hotel snob! The beauty of a traditional riad with the amenities of a 5-star hotel. Service was comparable to a Four Seasons - from the Front Desk attendants to the restaurant waiters to the housekeepers. Very accommodating: Last minute dinner reservation - ""sure!"" Need to move your hammam appointment an hour: ""no problem!"" Need a bellboy to run to the train station to buy you train tickets - ""happy to do it!"" They catered to everything we asked for. Location is also excellent as we could walk to most major tourist sites and when we took cabs they were no more than $5.    Every afternoon between 3-6pm they offer free moroccan mint tea and pastries. If you don't want to come to the beautiful courtyard for tea they will deliver it to your room. They also offer you a free large water bottle every night and a free bottle of red wine. We were also greeted with delicious cucumber pineapple welcome drinks!    The only negative (and I truly mean only) is that breakfast is not free ($15/person). But when I mentioned that I had thought breakfast was free the front desk person apologized. He saw I was disappointed so he graciously offered me breakfast on his compliments! When I insisted on paying he refused. What a gentleman!    The other negative was that my boyfriend (who is tall) felt the toliets in the bathroom were too small and too close to the bidet.

La Maison Arabe,Wassim wrote a review Dec 2018,50,Charming Riad — Amazing Service,We stayed at the Maison Arabe for four nights. Upon arrival the staff was so welcoming — they took our luggage seated us in a beautiful open space served us refreshments while they dealt with all the paperwork. It is a nice touch not to be standing at the front desk waiting.    The Riad feels like a maze but every corner has its own charm and feel. The carpets the art the walls etc. Even fireplaces. Fresh flowers everywhere including the rooms. Afternoon tea every day. Heated pool even in December (although it is still very fresh in the shade).    The two restaurants are excellent and sitting at the Arab House is enjoyable in and of itself. Cannot stress enough how beautiful and charming the riad feels.    What truly sets this place apart is the service. Adil at the front desk sets the tone with the hotel tour upon arrival but also his attention to small details. He recommended restaurants tailored to our interests. He also setup tours (city and atlas) for us with excellent guides and drivers. He even arranged for a suitcase delivery (he found it purchased it and had it delivered to our room!) to fit our many purchases.    Cannot stress enough how charming this place is. If you have time participate in the cooking class — it is worth it.    Nothing but good things to say.

The historic La Maison Arabe surpassed our every expectation! Exquisite in detail and decor throughout. Food and service top quality. We enjoyed the cooking school very much - the instruction and camaraderie with other attendees was a joy and a delight! I am including a note from my wife in regard to our gratitude to staff member Brahim in particular:    Dear Sir It was a pleasure to stay at your riad. I completed the Trip Advisor review and gave you 5 stars. We had a lovely trip. Your staff is fabulous and I wanted to call to your attention the experience we had with one gentleman in particular. We met Brahim in your restaurant and he was very attentive and pleasant but went beyond the call of duty to help care for our son who became ill after eating snails in the medina. Brahim prepared special teas for him and looked after him while my husband and I went on tour for the day. He called the room to check on him and sent rice and more tea to the room as well.I felt as though I had left my son in the care of family. We are very grateful to Brahim for his caring service. Congratulations on your hotel and thank you so very much for helping us in Marrakech. Marisa Martin    You won our hearts and our thanks! We hope to visit again.

We could hear Moroccan music every evening and birds chirping every morning when we left the doors to the patio open which was lovely. When we shut the doors the room was silent for those who need quiet to sleep.  The room amenities were plentiful (soaps shampoos conditioners towels) as were the hotel amenities (multiple restaurants a pool the spa afternoon tea and delicious Moroccan and/or International cuisine)  The location was wonderful - an easy walk to many historical buildings the square and souks (and the ATM) - and we never felt unsafe. Quite the contrary people seemed to go out of their way to be helpful - especially when navigating some of the twisty walkways through the souks.

The restaurants at Maison Arabe are the best in the city especially for Moroccan cuisine and the courtyard restaurant is quite beautiful. They have a fabulous cooking school which was very fun high tech organized and charming. Location is excellent . 2 blocks from government run fair trade market where local artisans are at work and price tags give visitors valuable information ( especially before going to the Souk). The Hammam and spa treatments are the equivalent of other more expensive treatments at other hotels but book early even before visit as spots can fill up.

The breakfast buffet was the bomb with many selections. Our party was sick with colds and upon arrival they sent staff to the pharmacy for cold medicine. I particularly enjoyed the jazz piano in the Jazz Bar too. The only caveat is there are a number of satires. Throughout the property which made it challenging for one person in our party.

La Maison Arabe,vacationCa wrote a review Nov 2018,50,A beautiful Riad within the Old City Walls near the Souk,We stay in La Maison Arabe in Marrakech in early November 2018. To get to the riad you follow a passageway to narrow for cars from a main street for a 1/2 block or so to a nice looking entryway. The original riad which I believe had 10 rooms was expanded through the purchase of an adjacent building and a major remodel. As a result the floor plan is a little confusing but quite nice once you figure out how to get around. Everything looks into a open central area where there is a relatively large attractive pool. There is a casual dining room on one side and outside tables surrounding the pool where breakfast lunch and casual dinner are served. On some evening there is pleasant live music played at the end of the pool during dinner. There is also a formal dining room and a very pleasant bar with live entertainment.    Our room was quite nice and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful.    It’s a few block walk to the central square area and into the souk which is very large and frantic with activity. The passageways are too narrow for cars but there are quite a few motor scooters and bicycles that are ridden at pretty high speeds given how crowded the area is with pedestrians.    Overall this is a great place to stay if you want a Moroccan experience within the Old City near the souk but still a pleasant oasis.,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,ca,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vacationCa

However I think it’s the staff that make this hotel special. Nothing is too much trouble and you will feel like a family member as soon as you arrive.  The service will rival any top hotel and so much better than some faceless chain hotel.  The location is very good and you can walk to most tourist attractions but taxis are cheap and the hotel will happily arrange for you. They also arranged tickets for museums which allowed us to queue jump and the queues were huge!  The food in the restaurant is just the best we almost had to force ourselves to eat anywhere else. The reception did recommend some places to dine and they were very good though and we did seem to get great service by booking through the hotel.  The spa is beautiful and we had a great hammam and massage.  I would also if you get time recommend trying the hotel’s country club.

La Maison Arabe,DEngelJ wrote a review Nov 2018,50,Beautiful Small Hotel,La Madison Arabe is located on the edge of the Medina in Marrakech. It is a conglomeration of six old houses so quite a rabbit warren of stairs and passageways and courtyards. The rooms are small but very attractive and partly furnished with Moroccan antiques. The staff is incredibly helpful and eager to please. There are two restaurants: a Moroccan one and a continental and Moroccan one situated around the swimming pool. The food is excellent. The cooking course offered by this hotel is wonderful and most professionally equipped.,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,CT,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DEngelJ

The rooms were well appointed very clean and serviced promptly twice daily right after we returned the room keys to the front desk when we left the hotel. The A/C worked extremely well and was operated via remote control from anywhere in the room which was very convenient.

La Maison Arabe,lauraz737 wrote a review Nov 2018,50,a must visit while in Marrakech,Even if you can't stay here you must visit. I highly recommend dinner poolside and the cooking class. The architectural details and the decor is stunning. I read on here to visit the jazz bar prior to dinner- so glad we did! The food was outstanding- but the service was the best hands down of any place we've dined in Morocco. We were relieved to have a variety of dishes that weren't Moroccan (after 2 weeks we needed a tagine break). The cooking class was awesome- you have little screens at each workstation so you can watch the instructor. One note- the class isn't part of the main hotel it's just down the street where the boutique is located.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Tucson, Arizona",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauraz737

Everywhere you looked there was something to take your breath away! It was beautiful enough that after settling in I walked around to take pictures so I wouldn't forget. We were then met by the thoughtful gesture of treats in our room and after our long bus ride it was more than welcomed. Breakfast the next morning was a wonderful way to start the day especially when you sat around the small pool and listened to all the birds flying around. But even better than all of that were the employees who in their quiet and gentle way couldn't do enough to make our stay one of the best I have every had and has left a lasting impression of Morocco for me. Staff at the Front Desk went over and above my expectations Servers at breakfast remember what you had the day before and who you sat with and the turndown service was special.

La Maison Arabe feels special as soon as you enter. We began to unwind straight away with our complimentary drink in the tranquil courtyard. The decor is impeccable and Moroccan. We visited one of the larger 5* hotels whilst we were away and were so glad we had chosen La Maison as it feels so genuine and personal.  The pool is warm and I wish I had found time for s dip there but we did spend a long time at the garden pool which is a short complimentary drive away. We had a lovely poolside lunch in another peaceful setting.  You must visit the hammam at the riad and I strongly advise having a massage after. It was bliss.

It has bags of charm and an authentic beautiful with its carved wood walls and ornate tiles.    Our room was very nice with a small garden terrace.    The restaurant (Le Trois Saveurs) was stunning located around the beautiful courtyard pool with live music both night we ate there. The food was also delicious the menu is split into Moroccan and international dishes and each seemed to be of a high quality if the four meals my wife and I chose were any indication.    The service in general was also excellent on the whole both in initial email correspondence and the excellent front desk staff who were very efficient and attentive.    My only small gripe would be there appeared to be some tension / minor arguments happening between some of the waiting staff during our meals which while not a big issue wasn’t quite in keeping with the level of professionalism we experienced throughout all other aspects of our stay.

A swimming pool plus a Kasbah complete with a pool about 15 minutes away by complimentary transport.    On checking out we were given pastries and water for the journey and Moroccan Cookery Book based on hotel recipes which is beautifully photographed. As an added bonus the hotel had completed or cards for emigration for the authorities at the airport. These added touches just emphasise how wonderful the staff are.

The staff was super friendly and can give you good advise about most things which you might need in Marrakech. We had both breakfast and dinner there I think maybe the best food experience we had on our trip and also the hammam is relaxing in a beautiful spa department downstairs. We even came back for lunch after traveling in Marokko and they helped us out with printing tickets and everything else we needed.

La Maison Arabe,Simon Cobb wrote a review Sep 2018,50,A truly special 5 nights...,This small and intimate hotel really does live up to the reviews. From the moment we arrived to the ungodly 4:30am time we left we could not have asked for more. Several things stand out for me:    1. First and foremost the staff. The hotel has only 26 rooms and consequently the staff really do know you during your stay. Nothing is too much trouble for them from finding me some new shoe laces to arranging for a new pair of trousers to be shortened at an incredibly reasonable cost. Everything is delivered in an understated yet professional and warm manner.    2. The cookery school. As a total non cook I did the 3 hour course with my wife and it was great fun. I even managed to produce something vaguely edible!    3. The country club. We settled into a routine of doing something in the morning (visiting the souks museums etc.) then catching the complimentary shuttle out to the hotel’s country club. It was 36/37C while we were staying and to escape the heat of the city and get away from the incessant motorbikes to this sanctuary was a vital part of our stay.    It was without doubt a 5-Star experience in a 5-Star hotel.

La Maison Arabe,margaret h wrote a review Sep 2018,50,The best hotel in the world,We're experienced travellers and have stayed in many hotels all over the world. My husband rates La Maison Arabe the best hotel in the world and for this reason we have stayed here in August for 5 years in a row.    August isn't the best time in Marrakech as it's so hot but it's low season and therefore a bit cheaper. The country club (free shuttle every hour) with a beautiful garden and pool is the place to retreat to when the temperatures are really high. Otherwise take a trip to the Atlas mountains which are close by.    What makes La Maison Arabe so special are the Moroccan staff who really go out of their way to help you. They are friendly and efficient without being embarrassingly servile and obsequious. Each year we see the same friendly faces which must mean that they are happy to work there - a good sign.    It is also a stunningly beautiful hotel full of interest and character and history. Its location is also ideal being within easy walking distance of souks shops some tourist sights/sites and some good restaurants. Cheap taxis are also available to go to more distant tourist sights/sites and good restaurants.    If I have a criticism it's that the lighting in the bathroom is too weak for my poor eyesight - and that has applied in all the different rooms we have stayed in over 5 years.    I would wholeheartedly recommend this riad-hotel for a relaxing break and interesting holiday in a culture very different from anything in the west. However it isn't really suitable for small children as there are no special facilities for them and there are many steps and narrow stairways making it unsuitable for pushchairs and also for wheelchairs.,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/margareth698

They used to serve their amazing biscuits with mint tea free of charge in the past and we did not have them this time which is a pity.. but rooms are always nice and clean and location is exceptional. And we did not try the spa treatments this time but in the past they were fantastic. So overall i would recommend it.,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Paris, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/si0nepc
La Maison Arabe,Bankh0liday wrote a review Sep 2018,50,Must stay here,What a delightful stay. Our Junior Suite was superb and the service was excellent. They have a lovely restaurant which had the best food in town and one of the finest spas I have ever enjoyed. I encourage everyone to have a Hamma Scrub which was the best I have every had!! We also took the cooking class was a superb treat. It is set up beautifully for groups and the chef was a pure delight. The front desk arranged tours which exceeded our expectations. They have a small pool on property and a country club and garden with a large pool 16 minutes away. If i saw any area of opportunity it would be to give guest complimentary coffee in the room they have it but for a fee. Also at the cooking school we enjoyed wine while we cooking but later were charged. We would have still enjoyed the wine but would prefer to know prior. These are small items and did not diminish the superior stay and 5 stars.,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Delray Beach, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bankh0liday

La Maison Arabe,smontgomery086 wrote a review Aug 2018,50,"Lovely people, beautiful property, delightful stay,",What a fantastic holiday we had while staying at La Maison Arabe. Although I could go on about how lovely our room was (it was gorgeous) and how fantastic the food was (I ate everything and then some) the most of note was how welcoming knowledgeable and appreciative the staff were. Marrakech is a city that overloads your senses and so transforming that go-go-go into an immediate feeling of home was in my opinion their greatest triumph.    In addition to the usual greetings and smiles the concierge made a conscious effort to help in all aspects. They scheduled several day-of activities all of which turned out better than we could have imagined including a cooking class (which I would strongly recommend) a camel ride outside of town and a guide which toured us through souks. All I would highly recommend.    For our last night in Marrakech we unfortunately had to stay at another hotel. Although luxurious in its own right it just didn't feel like home. We had become part of the hotel's fabric. It took all but 2 hours for us to email La Maison Arabe and book our last dinner were the magic all began.    Do yourself a favor and book this hotel.

What an absolute delight to return to Marrakech after the Sahara to La Maison Arabe where we were looked after so well and felt like we were coming home to our own little palace.    Raja (not sure about the spelling?) was absolutely amazing at the front desk. It was like she never slept - she was always there to answer any questions that we had help us out in any and every way that she could and was so friendly and welcoming that we felt at ease with her at once.    The property is absolutely stunning and even though it's one of the ""larger"" riads it didn't feel crowded at all. I would highly recommend the hammam in La Maison Arabe - it was the absolute perfect fix after our long travel into the Sahara and they were literally able to scrub every little drop of dirt off of me!    We stayed at a smaller riad at the beginning of our time in Marrakech and we honestly feel that nothing would ever compare to La Maison Arabe - it really is the ONLY place to stay when in Marrakech.",Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hong Kong, China",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/649glorial

It is the type of magical property that has not overlooked a single detail. The service while outstanding was still down to earth and friendly  being a guest here was a truly magical experience . It has charm old-school elegance and history you won’t get in the city’s flashy palace hotels .    We were made to feel welcome from the moment we stepped through the door and until the moment we left. Nothing was too much trouble everyone was very friendly. The food in the restaurant was wonderful the meals we had were excellent and every breakfast time was most enjoyable with very personal attentive service and staff - without being too obtrusive or over the top.  The room was beautiful spacious immaculately clean and very comfortable. Wonderfully decorated in the traditional Moroccan style the hotel has a nice colonial feel to it which we loved. The pool particularly the garden was an excellent place to relax during the day and the Jazz bar was perfect in the evenings. The whole ambience of the place was very relaxing and makes you forget about the outside world - it is a tranquil oasis.

La Maison Arabe,AndyBArmitage wrote a review Aug 2018,50,Perfect Gem,"This hotel offered everything I want from a truly good hotel it is now on my short list of world-wide favourites and I very much hope to return. It is well-located in a slightly calmer part of the Medina with a genuine local feel and ""real people"" going about their daily lives in Marrakesh. As well as its own you can walk to some top-notch restaurants if you want to go your own way. The interior is beautiful but not flashy putting old-time good taste above ostentation. Above all the unpretentious and friendly service was exceptional. If you want to treat yourself to a somewhat more expensive hotel and feel really welcome then forget the newer bigger or out-of-town places this is definitely the one. There were too many nice touches to list here... to keep it short I'd put first... a genuine welcome with delicious lime & grenadine cocktail the country club and really useful: when our flight home was in the evening after checkout access to the beautiful spa to take a shower and change which was so much needed when Marrakesh temperature in August was >37C. My (grown-up) family left just as you would hope: relaxed & happy but sad to be leaving.

La Maison Arabe,Samera E wrote a review Aug 2018,50,Excellent conference and retreat hosted here - AMAZING!,Following a recent conference I arranged at la Maison Arabe I am eager to share my deepest appreciation and recommendation for their services. I believe La Maison Arabe would great for any event – conference wedding family vacation small or large getaway – and I am excited to return in the near future. It seems anything could be possible at La Maison Arabe and the incredible staff there.    Our group comprised of about 30 international team members spent one week in Marrakech with accommodation and all conference sessions taking place at La Maison Arabe. All details were expertly managed by their team and it was truly a memorable week. Every room was charming every meal was delectable the conference room (transformed from the restaurant) was stunning and every meeting detail cared for with seamless service. At La Maison Arabe we were treated like royalty and also like close family home for a holiday. While we attended a number of group meals outside of the hotel in the evenings the service we received at la Maison Arabe was by far the best. It was clear that La Maison Arabe is committed to excellence which was shown in such high attention to detail.    Since they are a traditional Moroccan riad and boutique hotel we were particularly pleased with the way La Maison Arabe expertly adapted service and arrangements to fit the conference needs as well as provide the luxury getaway experience in an authentic setting. They adapted to the varied nature of our work ranging from formal meetings group dinners and celebrations and a cooking class. All of the staff were attentive and helpful and went above and beyond the call of duty including renting meeting equipment communicating with vendors on our behalf escorting guests arranging local SIM cards and teaching us how to use them cooperating with other restaurants so that our travel was smooth transforming both restaurants into a meeting space and many other crucial components.    We received glowing feedback from the attendees and could not be happier with how everything turned out. Some of the attendees have participated in multiple such trips and many took note to mention that this was the best executed meeting above and beyond others. Multiple guests commented on how La Maison Arabe was able to create a magical space that led to team bonding ease of collaboration active participation in learning and overall ease of experience. The successful coordination of logistics led to a highly positive experience for our group!,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled on business,"San Francisco, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samerae2016

We had a lovely relaxed welcome and a very easy check in before having a “grand” tour of the hotel. We stayed in suite 222 which was so spacious if felt like we had our own floor! We had dinner at the hotel two of the three nights we were there - to be honest I wish we had eaten there for all three as the food was outstanding and the setting by the pool was just perfect.  The hotel is perfectly located for the Souks (just 5 mins walk) and if you know where you’re going (we didn’t most of the time) you can be at the Jemma el - Fnaa in 20 minutes.  While we at the hotel we enjoyed a Hammam which I would certainly recommend.  The Jazz bar (at the hotel) is a great place for pre or post dinner drinks.  If you have some time to spare check out the Hotels exclusive “Country Club” which has a great pool fantastic facilities where we enjoyed a lovely leisurely lunch.  However for me what made our experience so special at the La Maison Arabe were the staff...the General Manger and the team are polite helpful and determined to give you a “first class” experience.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Staffordshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulG11StaffsUK

They went out of their way to accommodate us in a genuine way. The riad itself is so beautiful - every door carving tile and lantern! It is a special place. When we checked out of the hotel they gave us a present -- when I was thinking we should be giving them one! I left Marrakech after our meetings ended and returned back to the city.

La Maison Arabe,Adnan I wrote a review Jul 2018,50,A Lovely Experience: Kindness at its Peak,I entered La Maison Arabe after a grueling 26 hour journey with delays undelays (yes that happens too) and other excitement that I would rather not have on a journey leading to a vacation.  I arrived and was greeted by several people who carried my bags straight to my room where my wife was already staying and was brought a refreshing drink minutes later. The hotel staff was amazing from breakfast to being inconspicuous when they needed to be to catering to us even after we left (more on that later) the hotel.  The room was incredibly spacious with a balcony looking down into the pool. I didn't use the pool at the hotel but did go to the country club with a few other spouses (our wives were hard at work at the hotel; they all had a business meeting) and had a blast. We were there by ourselves had drinks and refreshments bought to us took a luxurious soak in the infinity pool and basically had a really wonderful time. I can't say enough good things about the place. The one downside (which actually for me ended up being an upside) was that the wifi was slow and would cut out once in a while. I actually did NOT end up complaining about it to the staff because I used that time to do some writing. So leave your social media at the airport when you leave your country and come hang out in Morocco and enjoy the moment.

I am so touched by their extraordinary service. I travel around the world a lot and this hotel is the best ever. This hotel beats the international brand hotels that we usually stay hands down.    We checked in late really late. We learned later that we checked after they usually get off work. Still they went out their way to cook me a meal. When we checked out for the airport the gentleman( I feel so bad that I don’t know his name) prepared water and snack for our ride to the airport. it is only 20 some minutes away it gets better they even prepared the “ leaving country” form and with the info filled for going through the custom I am so impressed.    Well it happened to be my birthday during our stay at La Madison. They paid enough attention to figure that out from our passports and they gave me a very sweat treat.    On top of all that the hotel has a traditional Morocco touch when it comes to decor beautiful flowers everywhere fresh every day nice dinning area at the pool beautiful and comfortable room really nice Spa and many other wonderful things.

It is “easy” for a hotel to have beautiful public rooms good shower heads and 1000 count sheets. Where true “professional hospitality” shines is in taking care of their guests with their hearts. This is especially true when the traveler is in need.    Our family arrived here two days ago with each one of us having gotten varying cases of “traveller’s disease” but one of us arrived ill. Management showed true caring and told us whatever we needed they were available. The next morning the family member was significantly worse and they suggested a doctor to come and they would have him here 15 minutes after he opened which he did. After an exam and prescriptions (taken to the pharmacy by the hotel and brought back to us quickly) the patient got back into bed. We had a guide hired already to take us around Marrakesh but we didn’t want to leave a family member behind. The manager Nabila insisted that we carry on and she would see to it that the patient was taken care of throughout the day with herbal teas and a lunch of bananas and Coca Cola. (With guilt) we took her advice and had a whole day of sightseeing. We checked in every so often. When we returned patient was sitting up in bed having just been fed grilled chicken and rice. He told us that all day someone would come by the room and ask him if he wanted anything and if he said no they would kindly suggest what they thought he should do. Honestly he got better treatment than if we stayed home!    Anyway the hotel like many good people is beautiful inside and out    Highly highly recommend the Royal Hamman and cooking class. Although the hotel is not inexpensive I believe it is a fantastic value for the beauty and luxury of the surroundings and the heart and soul of its staff. Thank you all so very much again!,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jerylp2016
La Maison Arabe,alexandclairej2018 wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Amazing stay in Marrakech,This was our first stay in Marrakech and we were lucky to be staying in le Maison Arabe. The hotel is a beautiful rambling old building with no two rooms looking the same. Our room was very comfortable with a nice big bed and complimentary bottle of wine and local biscuits.  The staff cannot do enough for you and can help with any problem or question you may have. It was my husbands birthday while we were there and they surprised him with some lovely cake and a glass of champagne each.  The restaurants offer amazing food and we also did the half day cookery course which was great fun.

Had it not been our first time in the city the hotel seems to coax you to just stay in. Food was superb service was excellent. It is the best hotel we have stayed in in terms of service and we have stayed in many 5 star hotels but the staff go out of their way to delight. Example when we arrived at midnight the kitchen was closed but they were still able to prepare a meal for us..before going to the airport they handed us our pre-filled departure cards. Overall kudos to the hotel team. We had a wonderful wonderful stay here and we would definitely come back to ! this hotel. We also extended out stay by one day.

La Maison Arabe,EH179 wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Wonderful Oasis,"La Maison Arabe was a beautiful and tranquil oasis in this fascinating city. The service was superb the food excellent and the size perfect. We shared the Royal Suite with my 2 teenage girls and felt as if we were living in our own mini-palace terrace and all. My mother had a standard room which was spacious and beautiful. The beds were extremely comfortable (and I care a lot about this) and housekeeping did a wonderful job. The hotel was small enough to feel intimate friendly and personal while not being so small as to feel limiting or intrusive. The food was the best we had in Marrakech by far (and my husband is a very discerning ""foodie""). We tried the hammam which was wonderful although there was a little bit of miscommunication about the ""disposable bathing suits"" you can wear during the experience and my daughters were uncomfortable so - if I had one piece of advice - it would be to clarify that information before the hammam experience and ensure that the client and service provider all understand what is happening. However it was a very minor confusion and I only mention it so that other clients can do a better job than I did of clarifying - particularly for teens. I highly recommend La Maison Arabe - particularly for families who would like a riad style experience but prefer a slightly larger size (although to be clear we rarely saw other guests and La Maison Arabe felt small. It just didn't feel ""constricting"" as very small hotels sometimes can - particularly with kids/teens.

The rooms are well decorated and nicely appointed. Ours suffered with a direct line of sight from the sun terrace so for privacy we had to keep the curtains close most of the time (net curtains would have sorted this).

Our room was large well proportioned and fitted out to a high standard. Unfortunately on my first night i found the evening noise intrusive and raised the issue at the front desk ho advised that they were full but would see what could be done. Shortly afterwards I was asked to inspect a new room to see if it was satisfactory - being a ground floor suite with an outside courtyard it was more than satisfactory and the upgraded room was accepted with thanks.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Australia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Snafuoz

La Maison Arabe,Katrina Glassick wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Amazing service and ambiance,I stayed 4 nights at La Maison Arabe and everything was wonderful they offer a truly special service. My flight landed an hour early so I called the hotel and my transport driver appeared within 5 minutes. On arrival I was given a delicious local drink in the beautiful courtyard before being escorted up to my room which was decorated with fresh rose petals (a lovely touch that reminded me of my engagement night at Raffles Hotel in Singapore!). The room had a view over the courtyard pool and restaurant however was quite quiet in the evenings. The hotel has a beautiful luxurious feel with 5 star attention to detail combined with the feeling of a traditional riad. On our request they organised a guide who took us through the souk he really listened to what we asked for and he took us to an amazing old palace. My friend ran out of time to buy her son a specific gift he had requested so the concierge magically got it for her! They also had a ticket for me to visit the Majorelle Garden so I didn't have to queue (the queue was hours long). Every request was met with a helpful attentive attitude and we felt like special guests. I will definitely bring my family back to experience this amazing hotel.

La Maison Arabe,The5MRanch wrote a review May 2018,30,A Blend of Fives and Ones = 3!,Beautiful hotel with a lot of character and comfortable rooms and the staff could not have been nicer and room service could not have been more prompt... If I were rating it for that it would have been a 5. The hotel was nice enough to book 3 dinners for us but when we got to the restaurant on the first night they had no reservation. The second night we were booked for 19:30 but their staff didn't show up until 20:00 so we had half an hour to kill just sitting around. And then when we arrived at the third place which our guide also said was the best spot in Marrakech we found that it was closed... on a Tuesday.    The other negative is that it's down a side alley which I must admit does have some charm but there really isn't anything else within walking distance for an end of he day cocktail unless you want to hang out with the guys at the motorcycle shop.,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Calabasas, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The5MRanch

The location is ideal as it's in the center of town near the square and to the souks so it's very convenient and easy to find. My room was huge with a sitting area balcony and fireplace. I had a separate room for bide and toilet as well as both shower and tub! Heaven :)  I loved the intimacy of a small riad that is well staffed. I dined at the international restaurant near the pool and had the most delicious dinner of marinated lamb chops in a yellow curry sauce that was divine! Breakfast was a smorgasbord of fruit pastries and eggs. I also ordered coffee one morning in my room and it came in under 5 minutes. The riad is next door to a famous cooking school where I took a class and learned how to make 2 Moroccan salads and a tangine. After preparing everyone in the class sat at a beautifully set table to eat the dishes we prepared. The class was well taught with lively instruction and helpful staff to make sure everything was done in correct order. It truly was special and fun. Lastly I took advantage of the spa had had a traditional scrub and massage including head massage facial scrub and foot rub. All were excellent and my skin has never felt so soft.

We also had dinner in their traditional menu venue. The food was excellent with very good music. I was expecting over the top prices on this but it was fairly reasonable.

La Maison Arabe,Zigenbock wrote a review Apr 2018,30,Beautiful Riad but staff inflexible.,We had three nights at this beautiful Riad that is in a great location in the Médina but very close to the new part of Marrakech.  The decoration at the Riad and the rooms are really done very nicely. Our room was VERY small with not a lot of space to put luggage. So not sure if all the rooms are this small.  The cooking classes that they offer should not be missed (see separate review).  We had dinner at the Moroccan restaurant which was good but nothing out of the ordinary. Definitely had better tagine in Fes.  Staff are all super friendly but I feel they were a little inflexible. Our tour company had arranged the lowest category room which was fine however I feel that we were given the WORST room in the Riad. We were on the first floor overlooking the courtyard that they use for checking guests in so the afternoon was alway very noisy. There were another five rooms that had to pass by our door so we were constantly woken late at night and then at 5.30am as people were checking out. Also there was a lot of noise from the room above.... we asked 5 or 6 times on the first and second day to change rooms but they kept on insisting that they couldn’t change our room which after working in hotels for many years I know was a lie they just couldn’t be bothered. This room would be fine for 1 night but not 3. They should have really moved us to a quieter room.  So to cut the long story short - make sure you know what room you have reserved before.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Salt Lake City, Utah",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zigenbock

La Maison Arabe,kwic1975 wrote a review Apr 2018,50,Best Moroccan cuisine,I will qualify the review by noting that my wife and I were battling severe jet lag when we dined here. Nonetheless we found that the decor and ambience was very elegant - almost stately. We picked a bottle of Moroccan wine - which turned out to be pretty good and paired it with chicken and fish tagines. My wife couldn’t make much of a dent into the tagines but I made an effort to sample both dishes. Both tagines were well balanced in their flavors without overwhelming the senses. There was obviously a lot of effort and crafting that went into the creation of these simple dishes. My favorite though was the fish tagine which reminded me of “steamed fish” from Bengal.  Service was very attentive. The restaurant had 2 seatings - 7.30 and 9.30pm so advance reservations are highly recommended.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"West New York, New Jersey",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kwic1975

La Maison Arabe,SwissStandard wrote a review Apr 2018,50,"Character, service and personality- Riad at its best",We stayed with 2 families for 4 nights in this stylish and historic Riad full of beautiful surprises. The location is outstanding- within the walls of historic Marrakech but still accessible by taxi. From here you are at walking distance to the souks but also close to all the good restaurants etc. What makes this place special is the character and historic details of the building stylishly decorated with Moroccan carpets and furniture. The true value is the staff. They organized all our excursions transfers booked our restaurants. Always great suggestions and keen to get feedback. It was like staying with a good friend. We loved our dinner at their Moroccan restaurant ( try the tajine with chicken saffron and lemon) and took a cooking class at their “country club” - a twin facility with a beautiful garden pool and well equipped kitchen.  The rooms are comfortable ( we took a large suite). A bottle of champagne and fresh flowers welcomed us and the kids enjoyed the daily supply of freshly baked cookies. This Riad is great for a city trip. Although they have a pool the real sunbathing or relaxing around the pool is at their country club - a shuttle is provided. Area’s for improvement? Hardly any... the breakfast buffet is good but simple the lunch service a little slow.

Staff everywhere - the breakfast team the Restaurant the reception team cleaning staff and doormen bellboys - all were attentive professional and cheerful. Everything was as expected of a 5 Star Riad but they went beyond that when it came to service. As someone said on another review - staff here seem to anticipate your needs even before you need it.

The shuttle picked us up at their hotel to take us to their country club location. The country club is set amongst trees and gardens beautiful! It reminded me of being in the wine country in California.    The cooking class is very well organized. I forgot the teachers name but he explained about the food we were going to make before proceeding the the kitchen. We had mint tea and bread before our class great experience!    The kitchen is beautifully set up with individual stations. TV monitors to see what the chef is doing. Ingredients set out at each station. It was super fun to be interactive and I loved the chicken tajine I made! In addition we made two different traditional salads one with eggplant and the other with tomatoes PLUS a dessert!    When we were done we all sat at a long table outside to eat the food we made. Delicious!  After lunch there is a pool to relax. ($20 pool fee) Knowing this we brought our swimsuits.

We stayed in the royal suite which had three levels. First was a bathroom and living room second was the master bed and bath and third was a private terrace. The decor was beautiful. One complaint was that the AC seemed to only cool downstairs and not upstairs.    The hotel itself is in a great location where you can get dropped off almost in front and it’s a short walk down the alley. Please note that Riads inside the Médina require a lot of walking as cars aren’t allowed inside. Whereas here you have a short walk to the hotel and a short walk to the Médina.    Food here is superb. It has one of the best Moroccan restaurants. It is recommended to make reservations as it fills up quickly.    Breakfast was buffet but with an egg station and a woman making Moroccan pancakes (our fave). Get a table by the pool and enjoy with a mint tea.

La Maison Arabe,tanda2016 wrote a review Mar 2018,50,Exceptional service,"This has to rate as one of the nicest places we have stayed anywhere offering comforts and facilities you would probably expect in much larger establishments. From the initial check-in (with fresh drinks on arrival and unexpected room upgrade) and guided tour of the hotel the room itself (very spacious and comfortable with complimentary water pastries and sweetmeats) the complimentary afternoon tea (and morning coffee too on one occasion) to the two restaurants (fine food at both). I could go on.    We availed ourselves of the so-called ""country club"" for one half-day - more a villa on the outskirts of the city than a country club - and in spite of being apparently the only hotel guests to do so on that day we were graciously treated and waited on. Lunchtime salad in the shade by the pool...Luxury indeed.    Cuisine in both restaurants is equally accomplished - on arrival we had lunch in the ""international"" poolside restaurant. Chicken tagine (not very international) was very good. We dined in the main restaurant one evening (tagine again not surprising but none the less good for that) - it was one of the best 2 meals we had in the city.    Special mention must go to the front desk and in particular Adil whose attention to each guest's requirements was exceptional. He seemed to offer the same level of personal attention to each guest addressing each by name and knowing what they had planned for the day. Quite a feat. He was a rich source of information on restaurants attractions taxi prices etc as well as arranging things for us (day out to the Atlas mountains taxis and other bookings). But to single Adil out would be unfair on all the other staff. Without exception we found them polite courteous and effective.

The hotel is an aggregate of 19th century riads located inside the historic Medina a UNESCO Heritage Site. The three story building which you enter from a nondescript side-street is a geode of fabulousness. Every door opened and every corner turned reveals sparkling Moroccan style and craft at its very best.    The staff quickly learned our names and our food preferences (LOTS coffee with hot milk and no sugar thank you very much).    The other guests were for the most part friendly polyglots; well traveled and gracious. It was not uncommon to hear a staff member flawlessly serve a single table contemporaneously taking guest's orders in English French Arabic Spanish and/or German. The complimentary breakfast buffet was fresh and delicious... and my frothy coffee cuppa joe never went dry.    Our complicated itinerary of some work and some play necessitated multiple trips to the airport and at one point a check out and a subsequent re-check-in a day later. This nutty travel dance: the taxis the departure times and arrivals were all facilitated by the front desk with earnest and exacting precision.    And if all that were not enough the location is perfect. La Maison Arabe is within walking distance of EVERYTHING. My Fit Bit was smokin'.    In short if I had summoned a genie from the bottle I could not have wished for anyplace more perfect.    Don't stay anywhere else.

La Maison Arabe,Renee G wrote a review Mar 2018,50,A wonderful Moroccan experience in a very special hotel.,My husband and I love to travel and we've been lucky enough to be able to go to many beautiful and interesting places in the world. We've stayed in wonderful hotels but none won our hearts the way that La Maison Arabe did. From the moment we arrived we knew we were in a special place. The staff greeted us in such a genuine and thoughtful way that we immediately felt at home. We were give a tour of the hotel and fell in love with the beauty and authenticity of the various rooms. If you've ever had a fantasy about Morocco La Maison Arabe will set the perfect scene for your dreams.  We were shown to our accommodations a lovely room with a private balcony overlooking the pool with a view of the city's roof tops. There were flowers in the room and on the terrace a bottle of wine and some delicious cookies to welcome us. The room was immaculately clean and the bathroom was large with a generous amount of toiletries. Plus it had my favorite of all appliances for winter travel--a towel warmer!  We were in for a special treat that evening. We went down to dinner a little early and at the suggestion of one of the hotel employees were directed to the club in the hotel where a pianist plays soft jazz every evening. It was a lovely and relaxing way to spend an hour and we reluctantly left the club because we had a dinner reservation at the hotel's Moroccan restaurant which we had heard was the best in Marrakesh. The meal we had there was indeed the best of our entire trip.  Also the hotel is perfectly located inside the medina less than a 10-minute walk from the main square with its food kiosks and entertainers.  My husband and I are thinking of going back to Marrakesh and La Maison Arabe with our children and grandchildren next year. It's an experience we don't want them to miss.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reneeg876

We made the big mistake of not staying there during our 5 days in Marrakech but were allowed to visit daily for dinner in the fabulous restaurant or just sit in the peaceful piano bar. What can we say that hasn't already been said it is just perfect in every way.  The surroundings are fabulous the staff are the best you will find anywhere in the world  and the food perfect. Yes you will pay a little more but this can only be expected for this luxury and level of service. All the staff were top notch but we particularly wish to compliment a member of staff who works the piano bar. His name? Midchi.

La Maison Arabe,GatorMarj wrote a review Mar 2018,40,"Lovely Hotel, Poor Service",This hotel is a beauty tucked away in the Medina. The decor is beautiful very authentic with traditional appointments. Our suite was roomy and beautifully decorated but very “ chopped up”. A sink in the water closet would have been nice. There was not enough room in the bedroom to place suitcases so they needed to be in a sitting area. The most challenging thing about this room was the two and a half flights of narrow spiral stairs. The staff at the desk was accommodating but the restaurant staff was rude and indifferent on the night we had dinner there and one breakfast. The second day breakfast had a different crew and they were more pleasant. All in all the service was not up to par for a luxury property. I would recommend this hotel with the caveat to be cognoscent of the stairs when booking. The second day staff was much better than the first so perhaps we hit a bad crew.,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Gainesville, FL USA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GatorMarj

La Maison Arabe,Tedstravelblogs wrote a review Feb 2018,50,Moroccan maximalism par excellence,The nondescript alleyway access to La Maison Arabe could hardly offer a greater contrast to what reveals behind the modest entry. Even the foyer is an understated entrée to an overstated opulence that slowly reveals as the inner passages of this superbly creative reconstruction of a cluster of eighteenth century medina courtyard residences are explored. This was the finest riad we have experienced in Morocco and up there among the most appealing accommodations we have come across worldwide. It was more akin to being a guest in a luxurious local residence than in a hotel.    The good: our suite 218 “Jasar” was extravagantly spacious sumptuously appointed conspicuously clean and as quiet as a tomb. Everything expected was there and it all worked as expected. The king bed was comfortable the linens plush and the pillows cloud-soft. The airy living room (and it's a room not just a space) opened onto a private sun-drenched garden courtyard opposite which was the very comfortable bedroom cossetted under a fabulously ornate cupola ceiling. The bathroom ensemble was a showcase of the Moroccan tiled art in a modern and well-designed facility the whole of which functioned flawlessly. We took both our dinners and breakfasts at the poolside international restaurant which was a delightful and delicious place to dine and absorb the thoroughly professional service and carefully crafted ambience. The staff at every level were ever gracious accommodating and competent.    The not so good: depending upon where your room or suite is located the place can be a maze to navigate otherwise the only disappointment we had was that we were not staying longer.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Vancouver, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tedstravelblogs
La Maison Arabe,Phil G wrote a review Feb 2018,50,A good hotel like this is hard to find.,We stayed for a week in February. The hotel is hidden down a narrow street but as soon as we went through the door we found it was a beautiful place to stay. Our room (211) was actually a mini suite and was very comfortable.  We found cozy lounge areas with lots of very tasteful ornaments furnishings and pictures. Very Morrocan!  There was a well stocked bar where a jazz pianist played each evening. As this was our first time in Marrakech we booked half board as we did not want to waste time checking out restaurants. We found the food to be very good and alternated between the traditional Morrocan restaurant and the international one that served a variety of European and East Asian dishes. There were no restrictions as to what we could choose from the menu with our half board package and we found many people seemed to be eating there who were not staying and had booked to come  from other hotels.  Nothing was too much trouble for the staff.. Adile and the team on the front desk were great. They were really friendly and very helpful with things like coming outside with us to negotiate taxi fares.  When we returned from our explorations every afternoon we would flop down in one of the comfortable lounges and were served with delicious mint tea with local pastries for which there was no extra charge.  I would have no hesitation in recommending this most hospitable hotel to anyone and especially those who have not visited Morrocco before and want to feel well looked after in a hotel that is central and close to the main attractions of this interesting city.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Greater Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/950philg

The service from the front desk staff is super; very helpful and genuinely concerned that you enjoy your stay. The rooms are well appointed with good bathrooms. But what is not to be missed is their Hammam. This was our first experience of one and it’s a real indulgence. You first enter a steam room where you are washed down and then your whole body is exfoliated and then washed down again. You then have a wonderful massage. La Maison has two restaurants; traditional Moroccan and international. We had dinner our first night in the Moroccan restaurant which also had two musicians playing through dinner.

The athmosphere was romantic and there was a musician playing Arab music in the background. We ordered traditional Moroccon lamb specilities. The food was excellent and the portions were big. They also serve wine (unlike some other restaurants in Marrakech).  The only minus comes from the lady who escorted us to our table - obviously it was not her best day. Otherwise the staff was nice and polity.  Recommend highly!,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Helsinki, Finland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/140jonnae

All of the staff is attentive and courteous always. Everyone here is remarkable. No matter how difficult my requests the hotel staff always found a solution. In addition the restaurant food is exceptional the pool is truly heated as well as extremely pleasant the spa services are wonderful and the hotel decoration is unique.

Fill up amenities in rooms - pay attention to women. We NEED conditioner! Or we can't go out!    The spa was great.    The international restaurant was not great.

La Maison Arabe,Vanesa G wrote a review Dec 2017,50,No doubt: choose La Maison Arabe! Absolutely perfect!!!,My husband and I visited Marrakech last month and we stayed at La Maison Arabe. We couldn't have made a better choice. Luxury and quality services at a very good price.    In my opinion its location is very good: there's only a ten-minute walk to the Koutoubia Mosque and 15 minutes to Djeema Fna Square.    Each member of the staff is so kind polite and helpful: they helped us with everything we needed and always had a smile and a nice word when we got to the hotel after a day out. The ambiance in the hotel is absolutly perfect: a typical riad with cozy surroundings and exquisite decoration. Besides its very quiet and comfortable which was very important for us as we wanted a place where we could relax.    There are two fabulous restaurants: The Moroccan Restaurant (that serves traditional moroccan dishes) and The 3 Flavours (an international one located next to the pool where you can try moroccan italian and asian dishes while you listen to live music). We had dinner twice at The 3 flavours and I must say that everything was delicious! I highly recommend rissotto and my husband really liked Tanjia a la Marrakichia. Breakfast is also served at The 3 Flavours and you can't leave without trying their tasty creamy and absolutly delicious homemade yoghourt.    Now let's talk about my room. We were very lucky to be upgraded to a junior suite. It was beautiful with a private courtyard luxurious surroundings a huge bed... The staff gave us a complimentary bottle of local wine and a selection of homemade cakes to welcome us to the hotel. I was amazed...    Last but not least I'd like to talk about the Hammam and the Cooking School.  The spa offers a large selection of beauty treatments and massages. We went for a package which included hammam (traditional bath) and a 45-minute relaxing massage. It was the best spa experience I have ever had! All the products that they use are 100% natural and you can choose between a wide range of oils and scents.  Finally I took a cooking class where I learned how to cook Chicken Tagine with preserved lemons and olives. It was great fun: we cooked tagine we learned how to prepare saffron tea and at the end of the lesson me and the rest of the Chefs had our dishes together. Before leaving we were given a recipe book and a small tagine so we could keep practicing at home.    I can't imagine a better place to stay if you're visiting Marrakech.

La Maison Arabe,raffoIreland wrote a review Nov 2017,40,Tucked away,We stayed her for 3 nights/4 days. It's a gorgeous little boutique place tucked away in Marrakech. We were picked up from the airport in a nice minibus with a guide called Omar who was very helpful. The hotel staff are very friendly and efficient. There are candles lit everywhere at night which made it lovely and atmospheric.    The room 221 was gorgeous although we had no view at all. We were slightly overlooked which made it difficult to open the bedroom curtains and this in turn made the room dark and difficult to put make up on. We were given a free half bottle of lovely red Moroccan wine and some little chocolates/pastries. A nice touch. Plus we were given a free bottle of water each day (it was 40 dirham for the same bottle of water during lunch or dinner!!) The food was expensive and although we dined in the restaurant which was international it had a poor choice of menu. It was about 200 dirhams for lunch. And about the same for dinner. Excluding drinks which seemed to be the same expensive price in most places.    We asked for the fire to be lit on our last night but the blow back of the smoke almost choked us all night and stung our eyes and all my clothes smelt of smoke the next day. A lovely thought but totally impractical.    There is a heated swimming pool at the hotel but you may be overlooked by people eating. It's a bit of a strange set op. It's such a pity they should heat the pool at the Country Club and make it usable for guests instead.    The Spa is absolutely gorgeous. I had a pedicure using Nivea cream for everything plus some cuticle oil on one foot only. NIVEA? I had my nails prepared for painting with no nice foot masks no luxury oils etc. I had a brief massage of feet and toes with the same NIVEA cream. The spa is full of nice oils but not a drop for my feet or legs. My companion had a manicure and there was a poor choice of Polish. Also only had same Nivea cream as my pedicure no nice oils etc! Terribly disappointing.    The Country club is a real haven it's a gorgeous relaxing place. It's about a 15-20 minute drive which is complimentary and totally worth it. You can just chill out and relax although the pool is perishing cold and unusable. You can get food and drink. They seemed to run cookery classes from here definitely worth looking into.    Be prepared to haggle for everything including taxis. And you'll rarely find seatbelts despite the manic drivers and the hundreds of scooters everywhere. Be very careful when crossing streets.    Spend all your dirhams or change them in the airport as you can't spend then in the airport unless you buy Moroccan made things and there's very few of them in the airport. Exchange rate is the same almost everywhere so make sure and change them. There's quite a good duty free in the airport although there are no bars in it so you can't buy a drink.    A fascinating place to visit and it's worth staying in this Riad when you're there. It's really a lovely place and sympathetically decorated. The fixtures and fittings are gorgeous and it has a great history. If you're using the spa have a massage.,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Ballykelly, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raffoIreland

The whole experience was absolutely perfect. The hotel bar and restaurant staff could not do enough for us but they were never intrusive. They seemed to magically appear when needed and had at their finger tips what we desired. We mentioned that we planned to go to the new Yves Saint Laurent Museum and they had tickets at the front desk so we did not have to bother standing in line which we would have had to have done. The bell man flagged a taxi and told the driver where we were going and told us the correct price to pay. This was a tremendous help because after having much experience with Marrakech taxi drivers it was a pleasure to be taken care of with the right information. The riad/hotel itself is a historic property immaculate and was impeccably and magnificently restored. Our poolside dinner was relaxing and delicious. When we walked into the piano bar we were greeted with ""As Time Goes By"". It could not have been more perfect. The room was a beautiful and comfortable Moroccan design with all the modern conveniences. Our only disappointment is that we could not stay longer to experience their cooking school hammam and private guest retreat outside of the city.

La Maison Arabe,gruberandrew wrote a review Nov 2017,50,Fabulously helpful staff and very relaxing experience,My fiancee and I stayed at La Maison Arabe for a weekend of relaxing and warmth. The staff was beyond helpful. The concierge helped arrange taxis dinner reservations guided tours and even purchased tickets to Le Jardin Majorelle in advance for us so we could avoid the line!    We did a 3 day spa package and it was fantastic. The hammam was super relaxing and cleansing then the massages were the perfect follow up for relieving stress and tension. We ate at both restaurants and the food was fantastic and traditional. Tea and small bites every afternoon by the pool was a nice treat. The pool setting was beautiful but surrounded by dining seating so more for a quick dip than vigorous swimming. There was a small sundeck with room for 8-10 sunbathers. The bar setting was great with a very friendly bartender and a great jazz pianist. The room was very well stocked and taken care of. We had a private patio but there are so many little lounge areas around the hotel both inside and outside that we really didn't need it except for coffee or breakfast in the morning. Great breakfast buffet too that could be sent to the room if you didn't feel like going down. Definitely try the Moroccan crepes!    The location was nice. Inside the medinah but not too far in the middle so it was easy to access by car with luggage and yet still close enough to walk to the main shopping area the souks (about 10 min walk). Only a 10-15 min walk to Le Jardin Majorelle too! Definitely do a guided tour of the souks to get the feel for it but then it was very easy safe and fun to go back alone.    Also the front desk will exchange money for you so don't bother wasting time at the airport. Cash is king in the souks and there are so many cool things to buy and negotiate for.

Room was quiet room service was fast and the staff was delightful and very helpful. Hotel is located in the hear of Marrakesh but down a very narrow alley making it rather difficult to find. Thankfully we had a guide. Its odd location however makes it a very quiet hotel other than the music from the hotel itself we heard no noise.

Must visit.,Restaurant at La Maison Arabe is open to everyone and the menu is ‘exclusively’ Moroccan you can also do cooking workshops at this hotel that are world famous! It has always been somewhere I had wanted to dine but had not had the chance too. Whilst staying in our riad Mohammad who manages Riad Tizwa had suggested we eat here one evening and kindly booked us a table. From our riad it was walking distance however it is quite easy to get lost so Abdo walked us there and it looked so easy… We got a taxi back as we were going to the Royal Mansour for drinks afterwards.    Once inside it was the most beautifully elegant setting we were sat by the pool and everything was lit up it was very romantic! The ambience was lovely relaxed yet refined and the staff were first class and very helpful when deciding on what to eat and wine suggestions. The food was simply delicious and melt in your mouth it is perfect for a special occasion or a holiday treat.    I had the Scallops to start on a bed of Green vegetables with a butter sauce then the Entrecôte beef that I had cooked medium it was divine my wife had Cheese Filo pastry dish with tomatoes and pesto dressing followed by a Thai curry. We both ordered the Chocolate creme brûlée and wished we had shared as it was so delicious and rich but the portions were huge!!

Incredible service wonderful rooms great location extremely helpful and friendly service staff throughout the entire hotel and our stay. The food was excellent the rooms were unique and beautifully decorated. The location was near the old marketplace which was enchanting and full of amazing crafts with superb quality. We had a guide and a driver while in the city which made the experience personal and tailored to our needs and time schedules. I cant wait to return and see more and understand the culture better.

La Maison Arabe,LKUG wrote a review Nov 2017,50,Absolutely the best,An amazing stay for three nights and four days! The minute we walked in we new we found our quiet oasis. My husband and I were exhausted from our travels throughout Morocco so when we got to La Maison Arabe we were ready to relax and unwind and that we did! From the minute we stepped in we were received and treated like royalties. The staff were amazing and answered all your questions and met our requests. Location is fabulous; tucked in a quiet street but only a 15 minute walk from the square. We also treated our selves to a deep tissue massage and the Royal hammam and were surprised at the level of service. We would highly recommend this place and we definitely would go back.

La Maison Arabe,Chuck P wrote a review Nov 2017,50,Luxury in Marrakech,After having toured throughout Morocco we spent our final three days at La Maison Arabe. Nothing like saving the best for last! Everything about this hotel is first-rate; spacious accommodations attentive and friendly service the restaurants and even a jazz bar.    Being located within the medina puts you right in the center of things in Marrakech. You can easily walk everywhere; especially convenient in the evenings.    The guest rooms are quite large and most have balconies. Make sure to try one of the pool-side restaurants one evening...both the food the music and the ambiance are spectacular!    What I found most appealing about La Maison Arabe is that you do not feel as though you're in a hotel but rather within a traditional Moroccan riad.

The staff provide the highest standard of service - it feels like they’re delivering from the heart. The architecture of this building is so special. It’s a bit like a maze. You never know what you’ll stumble upon. Even on the last day of my stay I stumbled upon a rooftop terrace I hadn’t known existed. It’s all so vibey.

La Maison Arabe,CartmanUSC wrote a review Oct 2017,50,Exceptional Comfort and Hospitality,From the moment we stepped into this splendid riad we were showered with smiles and offers of all types to try to make our stay nothing less than perfect. 2 things struck me immediately upon arrival: the warmth and friendliness of the staff and the sophisticated charm and energetic vibe.    The property itself is gorgeous and it is located conveniently in the medina but in a quiet area away from the raucous of Jemaa el-Fna and the souks. Time to walk to the souks is about 10-15 mins 15-20 mins to Jemaa el-Fna    Ours rooms 218 and 245 were breathtaking. The balcony in 245 looked down at the pool/dining area which was gorgeous at night and permeated by a great vibe and filled with elegant Moroccan live music. 245 was like a mini palace! It had a nice little courtyard. Rooms were well appointed and details well considered. Beds were very comfortable and it was wonderful to fall asleep amidst Moorish-style luxury. No noise pollution from the outside.    But I still come back to how great and genuine the service was. No request was an inconvenience and all questions were dealt with patiently and courteously. I was staying with my elderly mom whose mobility was slightly impaired so I really appreciated the staff's patience with her slow speed and their frequent offers to give my mom a helping hand while she was negotiating some of the stairs.    Pros:  - Hospitality location convenience comfort vibe design restaurant    Cons:  - massage was average stairs could be a challenge for those with walking difficulties.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,Hong Kong,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CartmanUSC

We chose a couple of vegetarian options which were sensational. We started in the air con restaurant for our starter and main dishes and then we transferred to the courtyard pool area for our sweet. The band were playing traditional music all in all a fabulous ambiance and a beautiful setting to enjoy some sumptuous gastronomy. The local red wine merlot? was very reasonable. The fact this place was favourite of sir winston Churchill when he was in town added to the romance although now bearing no resemblance to the eatery that he frequented after significant refinement back in the late 90's.

La Maison Arabe,BubsandCo wrote a review Oct 2017,50,An unbelievably great experience,A perfect stay it truly could not have been bettered.  We booked this at relatively short notice to accompany our daughters who had managed to find a very cheap riad in Marrakesh in August. They then wanted some moral support. After a little internet work found this relatively close by and booked - our first trip to Marrakesh and yes in the heat of their summer.  The stay here was just perfect.  From the first welcome with refreshment after a days travelling to fond farewells nearly a week later no thing was too much trouble for the staff here; little fresh bread rolls at breakfast help with navigation and travel around town places to see and do to winding down with evening piano playing or a trip out to their 'hidden' garden with a large pool.  We had a delightfully spacious accommodation in the old block more of a suite of two rooms and a bathroom. The whole of the establishment is on several layers around a couple of courtyard squares. Breakfast was around a small pool in the open that included a very extensive buffet with eggs and pancakes cooked to order  We also enjoyed a formal evening meal together in the restaurant and were suitably educated with a fun cookery class.,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BubsandCo
La Maison Arabe,tobeslo wrote a review Oct 2017,50,A homely touch with the warm Moroccan hospitality,My wife and I spent three nights at this lovely boutique hotel and we felt at home.    The premise is a gradual expansion from a humble restaurant to a luxury yet homely hotel that retains its history characters and charms while added the modern luxury and convenience.    Their choice and quality of food were memorable. La Maison Arabe offers a range of culinary options on site including the lovely Moroccan restaurant that its degustation menu is highly recommended the international restaurant and the alfresco breakfast by the poolside. Their spa and hammam area is one that we enjoyed - it was tastefully decorated and their signature Royal Hammam is superb.    We didn't have time to visit their country club which is 15 minutes away by private shuttle and attended their cooking class that is carried out on the premises. Next time!    The hotel is located within walking distance to the Marrakech medina and Jemaa el-Fnaa which we had enjoyed the stroll and felt safe.    Staff was friendly proactive and professional. They even took the initiative to inform me that they had overcharged my bill as an honest mistake (without even me aware of it) following an internal review after I had already settled the bill and they quickly rectified the issue and apologised continuously.

La Maison Arabe,Michael J wrote a review Sep 2017,50,The best,"This may be the best hotel I've ever had the pleasure to visit.    It is one of the two most beautiful with its small courtyards beautiful wood and tile work pool-side restaurants and spacious rooms (we had a small suite I did not see a standard).    Second the food in the two restaurants is excellent -- all traditional Moroccan in one a variety in the other. The settings for the restaurants are each gorgeous in different ways and dinners were accompanied by live soft lute and guitar.    We took their free shuttle to their ""country club"" pool -- another beautiful place in among olive and pomegranate trees herb gardens and pond where we would relax in sun or shade swim or enjoy a snack or light lunch.    Finally what made this stay for me was the friendliness and service. Ice pack for my hurting knee? No problem. Our plane not leaving until hours after check-out time? Not a problem. Airline foul-up and we needed to return to the hotel for another night and we needed help working out airline details? Not a problem.

La Maison Arabe,Fiona S wrote a review Sep 2017,50,Treated like a V.I.P.,"I spent 4 nights in this lovely riad/hotel with my 22 year old daughter as part of a 12 night trip to Morocco Throughout the stay we were treated to exceptional service by every member of staff who all seemed to sincerely wish that we had the very best experience in the hotel and out and about ensuring we were warned of such issues as ""faux guides"" in the souks. The location is good being 10 minutes or less from the main part of the medina once you learn to negotiate the route without getting lost. Paper maps are useless. My daughter downloaded google map for the area we were in; we were then able to find our way around with only a few wrong turns.    The building is beautiful but its various sections provided a mixture of styles and periods which only added to the pleasure of the stay. All areas were decorated in a relaxed tasteful and elegant style appropriate to the setting. Our room was probably a standard room but the free slippers and daily fresh bottled water alongside good toiletries and twice daily visits from housekeeping made it feel like a deluxe room. The beds were very comfortable and air-conditioning was very welcome given the 39 degree temperatures on some of the days we were there. Free Wifi was reasonable in the room but good in the public areas.    The spa area was stunningly beautiful and relaxing and the facial/scalp massages we had together were faultless. I agree with recent reviewers about the warm friendly ambiance of the Jazz Bar partly due to the head barman but also the really enjoyable live piano music.    Breakfast was great especially the freshly made moroccan crepes and omelettes but again the service and surroundings on the terrace round the pool made the experience special. Similarly dinner on our first night was excellent especially the wonderful bread but the service and surroundings made it more than worth paying the slight premium we paid to eat here. In my view this was the nicest tagine of our holiday.    I am particular about the standards I expect from hotels but can find no fault with La Maison Arabe and its unfailingly attentive staff. Inshallah I will come back some time to soak up the warm hospitality of this wonderful place.

La Maison Arabe,Martin A wrote a review Sep 2017,50,Is it possible to add a little more stars than five,it was a very long time since my first visit to Marrakech not to Morocco Tangiers countless times on the ferry from Algercieras and just a couple of years back for a few weeks in Essaouira but this five day trip was my first time back in over forty years staying at the CTM on the Jemaa el Fna then a budget hotel tied to the bus company.In many ways Marrakech has changed. the Souk seems less hostile positively friendly once you get into the swing of things and uptown is in places really chic and in others bustling with the same array of retail outlets seen on many of our own high streets and don't forget MacDonalds but restaurants are where it has really changed some fabulous eating places all over and some down the most uninviting alleyways where once a western tourist would just never venture which brings me to La Maison Arabe not the worst of alleys and it is signed from both sides but still missable but this alley brings you to the modest entrance to one of the loveliest places I have ever stayed in I've never stayed in a road before only hotels and I did have a look at their website before committing but that couldn't convey the real beauty of this place small salons and quiet corners areas of unparalleled beautiful and quirky objects I've never found anywhere of such peace and tranquility to stay before. the rooms well at least mine was gorgeous there are only 28 (if you can find that many) overlooking a swimmable pool for the size of the establishment and a restaurant of some repute although only dining there once (as stated there are many great places to eat) it appears very popular with non guests but the 'real icing on the cake' are the staff never overbearing always smiling and so-so helpful all of them well all the ones I came into contact with. The doorman front desk the restaurant staff which I suppose goes without saying for its designation. We only ate breakfast once in the time we were there would've been more but was eager to get out and about and that was an experience the lovely lady making the pancakes without a word of English has to be worth the cost on its own there is a picture of her somewhere on the website.......but more they have a country club served by their own minibus bigger pool birdsong idyllic after the hustle and bustle of the city. Ah but...there is always a but and because of the overall quality I'd still rate it as high as I do; the wifi I had to complain a mere 4.5GB and even that was intermittent but that may be sorted by now as they were working on it. I did a speed test at the country club 44.5GB go figure ???

It was amazing from the moment I checked in to the sad moment I checked out. Fresh flowers and complimentary wine await you in your room which is lavish yet tasteful--well appointed with everything you need. WiFi works seamlessly and room temp is totally under your control. My room faced the garden and pool with a balcony overlooking it--the garden was lush with trees potted plants and the pool all arranged to exude an atmosphere of peace and calm.    The staff at Maison Arabe is deeply committed to making every aspect of your stay the most pleasant and restful experience possible. Without exception they are caring kind and responsive to your every need and want. The front desk will book and arrange pretty much anything you want to do and as far as I could tell the charge for it was honest and competitive with something you might get on line.    The country club accessible by complimentary shuttle was about 15 min away and an oasis beyond my expectation. The pool is surrounded by olive pomegranate and grapefruit trees all bearing fruit and the bar menu there assures you a delicious lunch and drink of your choice. Every day I spent a long morning sight seeing or shopping and retired to the country club for the afternoon to rest and relax.    And of course the location which was convenient to many of the sites in the Medina and not far from the modern part of the city. I could walk freely to most places! Not to forget the cooking course at the riad which taught me how to make chicken tagine--I learned a lot from the dada and her assistant.

La Maison Arabe,Battered Orange S wrote a review Sep 2017,50,Old world elegance and charm,Our first trip to Marrakech was last January. We stayed at La Maison Arabe and fell in love with it and with the country. We recently returned from our second trip to this gem of a riad. We stayed two nights prior to doing a 4-night trek then stayed two more nights on our return. It was like coming home. Happy familiar faces and staff greeting us so warmly. Staff and service are unparalleled here. From Moustafa at the front desk to Rashida the beautiful woman who greets guests who are dining there to the impresario Rashid who's domain is the elegant and comfortable jazz bar. You know you've found a home when staff goes out of their way to say hello and take care of you. This time we enjoyed a day at the Country Club their beautiful space about 15 mins away from the riad with its stunning landscaped gardens pool and restaurant. What a wonderful experience! We were able also to enjoy two different room styles beginning with a stunning suite in the old part of the riad and then a beautiful room overlooking the pool in the new part of the riad. All amenities per usual were impeccable down to the littlest details like fresh flowers wine and pastries waiting for us in the room. This riad is all about old world elegance. There is a deep sense of tradition and of pride among the staff and it shows in every detail. Lastly the hamam is a must. This time I had the best massage of my life! Its location makes it very easy to pop in and out of the souk which we did each day. We are so charmed by La Maison Arabe we plan to return over Christmas and New Years. Thank you to the team here.

La Maison Arabe,HCSACT wrote a review Sep 2017,30,Fancy Rhiad with some issues,La Maison Arabe is a lovely place with great decor and style. It feels somewhat overdone in terms of the old city at times with guests often dressed perhaps quite properly to match the grand atmosphere. If one likes a more relaxed way of life there are other Interesting and very fine Rhiads.    Le Maison Arabe has some issues that can be irritating. In at least a number of rooms the Carrier brand air conditioning units display the temperature on very large LCD panels in bright white light that means the bedroom is far from dark at night. This is an extraordinary oversight by the management. The hotel seems sometimes places essential citronella oil style lamps in the rooms - without advising. These may be intended to deter mosquitoes but can make the room unpleasantly scented.    The breakfast is adequate but uninspiring. The Jazz bar is very pleasant and the cocktails well made from a well stocked bar.    The hotel pool whilst attractive is located close to the breakfast and dinning area this being somewhat off putting for those guests who prefer a modicum of privacy when dressed for swimming.    An interesting place to stay a night in the old town but not perhaps the most relaxing of the premium Rhiads.,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Greater London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HCSACT

They even arranged a birthday surprise for me at the Jazz Bar where the pianist played happy birthday accompanied by the staff. It was very sweet. Adil at reception was a great help with setting up our mobile and assisting with transportation and other needs. They do currency exchange right at reception which makes it extremely convenient. The room was comfortable - great blend of modern and traditional styles. They have tea time every day with traditional Moroccan mint tea and daily cookies made by the chef.

La Maison Arabe,MarKno wrote a review Sep 2017,50,"WOW,,,,",The entrance of La Maison Arabe is in a narrow street you can easily overlook. The restaurant is part of a small hotel (Ryad type).  Once inside we were overwhelmed by the beauty of the place. You have to walk through a few aisles to get to the dining area. On the way take some pictures.  The restaurant has its tables spread over two floors around the swimming pool. We were seated on the first floor and had a marvelous overview of the open sky patio. Later at night a duo seated at the swimming pool would play music for the guests.  The friendly waiter helped us choose the dishes. As appetizer my wife took a selection of Moroccan salads while I took some «Briouates» or stuffed pastries. Delicious!  For major dish we took a Tajine of lamb and a Taiji of lamb. Again both excellent although the tajine was a bit dry according my wife.  Since we didn’t have a clue about Moroccan wines we followed the advice of the waiter: a red Volubilia (2013). Surprisingly good medium body good nose.  To finish I took a well prepared sorbet and my wife a mint tea.  This restaurant is a must when visiting Marrakech. Best to make a reservation. And for the ones wanting to learn the Moroccan cuisine better the restaurant organizes cooking workshops.,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Lisbon, Portugal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarKno
La Maison Arabe,Dedun69 wrote a review Sep 2017,10,The worst of Moroccan personality,"I did not get to stay at this property so the review is not about the hotel stay but I did attend an event at this property but I needed to write this review to showcase the despicable character of the Event Planner and the moral failing that is prevalent in this culture where lying is acceptable and cheating people is second nature.    A friend threw a birthday party to celebrate her 50th which I attended The location is gorgeous and the party was awesome.    I had been out earlier so my phone battery was dying by the time I got to the party. I had asked the Event Planner to please assist in charging my phone. She had obliged. For some reason my inwi sim card got locked when my battery died and I was erroneously informed that I will not have access to the WIFI unless I had a working sim so I decided to switch back to my American sim so I could upload my pics onto social media.    The guy who had attempted to assist me mistakenly broke my sim card tray and apologised profusely which I accepted. I was worried as I did not know if I would need to replace my entire Galaxy Note 5 because of this.    The Event Planner comes in and says no worries she'll send another sim to my Riad and I said Ok. It dawned on me 5 mins later that she never asked what Riad I stayed at. I then challenged her and she then asked me which I told her. As I guessed she never sent the sim tray the next day as promised.    What really prompted this review from me is the fact when I complained to my friend who had the party these liars had the nerve to tell my friend that there had been a Samsung Galaxy Note 6 missing from the party and she should ask me if I accidentally took it! How rude and condescending. Never mind the fact that Samsung never made a Note 6. What a liar! Besides who takes someone else's phone by ""accident"" if not to steal it!

La Maison Arabe,margaret h wrote a review Aug 2017,50,The most wonderful hotel,We returned this year for our 4th visit to La Maison Arabe so you can tell how much we love it.    In a country with so many beautiful hotels and excellent restaurants what makes La Maison Arabe stand out is the quality of the Moroccan staff who are efficient and endlessly helpful. They go out of their way to make your stay as comfortable and stress-free as possible. Clearly they are proud of their hotel and enjoy working there.    This year we noticed a marked improvement in the quality of food served in the poolside restaurant. Last year it was good but this year it is excellent (there's a new chef I believe).    I wholeheartedly endorse all the rave reviews here. I read the very few negative reviews and honestly cannot understand how anyone can write in such terms. My husband and I are seasoned travellers with experience of hotels all over the world as well as elsewhere in Morocco and we both judge it to be up there with the very best. I do have suggestions for improvements but they are minor tweaks.    Our room (212) which we had last year and the year before is spacious with copious storage space. It has a quiet shady balcony which is perfect for relaxing on in the early morning and evening. The problems I have centre on the bathroom which I found rather too dark for my poor eyesight - I would like to have one strong light near the basin. Also the shower screen is not wide enough so you can't help but splash the floor with water when you take a shower. These are minor problems though and they don't make me love this hotel any the less.    The hotel's country club (free shuttle every hour) gives guests the best of both worlds because you are near the Medina and souks and also have access to a beautiful quiet garden with a lovely large swimming pool.    We shall definitely be back again next year.,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/margareth698
La Maison Arabe,Jen C wrote a review Aug 2017,40,"Beautiful space, wonderful service",I only stayed for one night - but having come to Marrakech several times I've always been curious about staying. I arrived early in the day and the staff was able to accommodate me and give me an early check-in. I waited about 30 minutes by the pool with some delicious pastries and a great coffee while they readied my room. Having taken a night flight from Johannesburg to Paris I was ready for a shower and to refresh and was fed showered relaxed and out the door again for a long day of work by noon!    I came back that afternoon after a long day and started off the evening in the piano bar. The service in there was so fun! I was treated like a VIP (maybe because I was the only one in there to start) and they took such good care of me. The drinks were great the piano player was divine- and then the bartender even escorted me to dinner near the pool and made sure I got the best seat in the house.    The service at the restaurant was top notch- I ordered my favorite moroccan dish; chicken tagine with lemons and olives. It came out very quickly but was pretty dry and tasteless. Perhaps they had had an off night in the kitchen but there were very few lemon slices and just a few olives so not enough to keep it juicy and flavorful. After another glass of wine and some traditional moroccan sweets I was off to bed.    The room and bed was comfortable and was lovely waking up to a sunny terrace. I wasn't aware that breakfast wasn't included in my rate (i read the fine print later) and though I didn't each much the spread looked nice. It was buffet style for D150- I've never paid for breakfast ever in Morocco so this was a small disappointment but rules is rules.    Overall I would say the service here is top notch and the main reason to stay here. The reception staff was eager to jump to my need if anything ever arose and they went so far as to fill out my departure form for me even though I wasn't leaving until the following week. Details you would never even think of they had thought of. I would recommend this place highly though if you are staying for several days would also suggest trying other places in the medina just for fun.,Date of stay: August 2017,,"Durham, North Carolina",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/salamasana

We went for a drink before on the hotel bar complete with live piano for background music and were greeted by friendly and helpful a staff who were extremely attentive to us the second we walked in. The building itself is stunning and everything I was hoping that Marrakech would be - it is absolutely stunning to the point of being shocked as you are taken down and walk into the restaurant courtyard. The service and food were absolutely incredible - I recommend the Moroccan salad to start and the lamb shoulder for mains. The staff were the cherry on top of a wonderful evening.

To relax in a tranquil gorgeous space was exactly what I needed to forget about life back home.    For henna lovers Henna Cafe is a 5 minute walk. Supporting local women is a must! The Square at night is a must see (10-15 min walk). I would advise having the hotel set up airport transfers. We got majorly ripped off (300 dirhams) by the taxis at the airport.

La Maison Arabe,CoupleCastaways wrote a review Jul 2017,50,EXCEPTIONAL in every way,"Before I get into the overall review I want to highly recommend that you take the Cooking Workshop!!! I guarantee you will leave saying ""WOW."" Overall our time at the property felt exceptionally elegant and romantic. The staff went above and beyond to make our stay memorable. We couldn't have asked for a better experience. It was our first time in Morocco and first experience staying at a Riad. We were celebrating our birthdays and an overbooked flight delayed the start of our trip there but our experience at the property made up for it. They were so attentive to our needs and put extra special touches on our stay.... rose petals all over the room a bottle of wine upon our arrival and Moroccan pastries. They also sat us at a beautiful table poolside in the restaurant which is one of the most romantic dinner settings we've ever experienced (from the romantic candle lights to the beautiful live Moroccan music and delicious menu). The Hammam Wellness Spa was such a treat and the best recharge we could've imagined. We got the Royal Treatment package (scrub body mask and massage) and highly recommend that. The Cooking Workshop was BEYOND fun SO informative about Moroccan dining/culture (from learning about the herbs in the garden to a talk on common spices used learning to make the traditional bread in the mud oven deserts salads and a main course and we even learned some useful cooking techniques). Our group was comprised of a group of ladies us and a family with small children and ALL of us thoroughly enjoyed it so it's definitely safe to say that it's a winner for a variety of visitors.

La Maison Arabe,Richard P wrote a review Jul 2017,40,"Great hotel, ideally located",Me and my wife stayed at the hotel for 5 nights in a suite. The hotel is ideally located 5-10 minutes walk away from the medina and approx. 15 minutes drive from the airport. In advance of our stay the hotel organized our transfers which although slightly more expensive than a normal taxi meant that we were met on arrival and had a fixed price trip in an air conditioned car.    On arrival the staff did everything they could to ensure the hotel exceeded our expectations. We had a tour by the manager while our bags were taken to our room. This included an explanation of the sites nearby restaurant recommendations and assistance with booking a guide or excursion outside the city.    The hotel is more geared to adults which for us was a bonus. The hotel has modern features but is quite traditional in terms of Architecture and layout which again was exactly what we were after. The restaurant at the hotel is in the top 20 restaurants in Marrakech and the food was excellent. The guitarists in the evening were a nice touch. The separate bar was also great and reasonably priced for the area.    There is a pool at the hotel accessible for guests up to 6PM albeit it's used more to cool off. The main swimming pool advertised is actually at a country club located 15 minutes drive from the hotel. Transfers are hourly and free. I didn't actually realize this at the time of booking. Whilst a little bit irritated initially the Country Club actually offers a far bigger pool with lounge areas a bar serving food and drinks and a really nice garden growing fruit and vegetables. They also hold cooking classes at the club. The journey to and from also allows you to see more of Marrakech.    Our room was big fully air conditioned with a terrace. Room service was available as you'd expect from a 5 star hotel.    I only have one gripes and that's the wifi. Even the high speed wifi was painfully slow for most of the day particularly at the country club. There were random times when it worked perfectly. Apps like Spotify and Youtube didn't work while I was out there unfortunately.    Apart from the above I'd give the hotel 4.5 out of 5. I'd stay again and would definitely recommend it to couples who'd like some peace and quite with the option of exploring a very different city with a lot to offer.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Surrey, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B8220NIrichardp

La Maison Arabe,Dawn D wrote a review Jun 2017,50,Really lovely traditional riad,I spent ages trying to choose a hotel for Marrakech for myself and my two teenage children. I couldn't decide whether to be further out and have a hotel with space and a big pool or whether to have a riad in the city. In the end we went for La Maison Arabe as we wanted a more authentic Morroccan experience walkable to the sights and not a big chain hotel. This in hindsight was definitely the right decision. One of the biggest draws for the hotel was the fact that it has a 'country club' complex about a 15 minute drive from the town centre which we really liked. There's a free shuttle bus to and from the club and we found it perfect. There's a big pool sun loungers and bar/eating facilities. I would recommned La Maison Arabe for this facility alone as it means you get the best of both worlds; beautiful city riad but space and large pool out of town. There is also though a beautiful swimming pool in the riad and a small sunbathing area as well if you dont want to take the minibus to the club.  We loved everything else about the hotel. Room was lovely good aircon (needed it!) wifi included and was good (there was the option to pay for upgraded wifi - but we didn't need it as the complimentary service worked perfectly well). Breakfast was great (better than other riads I've stayed in) and a good choice of food. We ate supper in the hotel restaurant twice and food was good. The staff were all lovely and helpful. The bell boy showed us to a couple of places by foot when we asked for guidance which was very useful as Marrakech is a bit of a maze. The main square is walkable in about 15 minutes. We used taxis to go to other tourist places such as the Jardin Majorelle which were lovely.  I'd also recommend using the hotel taxi pick up from the airport which we arranged with the hotel by email in advance. Although more expensive than just picking up a taxi at the airport it was worth the (not excessive) extra cost for peace of mind and ease of travel.  The riad was lovely beautifully decorated and our room nicely furnished with the most amazing decorative ceiling in the bedroom! We all had a massage at the spa - although not cheap but very nice.  You can take (free) afternoon tea with traditional pastries in the hotel which was a nice touch.  Overall we had a great time. The hotel was a haven away from the craziness of the city and we would highly recommend it.,Date of stay: June 2017,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dd251

La Maison Arabe,Evan M wrote a review Jun 2017,50,Great Moroccan Stay,"The La Maison Arabe is large riad-style hotel with several riads stitched together in a maze of hallways (28 rooms i think) and a top cooking school spa and restaurant all on site. Its location is good about a 10 minute walk to the Jemaa el Fna but the best aspect of this hotel is its incredibly helpful staff. They helped us with general directions car service bus tickets taxis cooking school and spa appointments at the hotel but my sense is that the service is great at all the top Riads/hotels. Perhaps its most differentiating factor is access to a second ""country club"" location with a larger pool with day beds and lounge chairs. It was a great break in the afternoons from the chaos of the Medina. Our room itself was fine the breakfast was good (you should be able to negotiate its inclusion when booking) and there is a bar in the hotel (the Jazz Bar). The cooking school was great too.    Specifically on the La Maison Arabe cooking school the half day cooking school was full when we tried to sign up (16 people) so we opted for a one hour class instead which turned out to be private. It was awesome! We made a lamb Kefta (meatball) in tomato sauce and ate it afterwards. It was one of our best meals of the trip and one of our favorite experiences overall.

The staff were friendly and very helpful with great attention taken to every little detail.  We ate in the Les Trois Saveurs on both nights which has such a lovely atmosphere with tables positioned around the pool and local guitarists playing.

The service at the hotel was spectacular. We had two tangines to take home I asked if they had any way to pack them and they said ""yes of course"" and took them and bubble wrapped them for travel. We had dinner with a Moroccan family one night and the hotel prepared an box of pastries for us to take as a gift. The staff was always so friendly. Not stuffy or pushy at all and made us feel extremely comfortable and welcome. Also the hotel itself was absolutely beautiful and every detail was attended to. We had dinner there one night that was excellent and relished in the breakfast spread every morning which included everything you could imagine...made to order eggs cereal fruit bread Moroccan pancakes etc. Oh and did I mention our room was great too!

La Maison Arabe,ChrisHOhio wrote a review Jun 2017,50,All we expected and so much more,I did a substantial amount of research and chose La Maison Arabe due to the huge number of excellent online reviews. We were looking for a small luxury riad in the heart of the city rather than a larger resort such as La Mamounia and we were thrilled with our choice. Our suite was the size of a New York apartment with private terrace comfortable living room leather paneled bedroom ample bath and small office. We arrived to fresh flowers Moroccan wine and pastries and the most gracious service we've experienced. Rachid the Barman was delightful other staff equally helpful and there's a reason the traditional restaurant is among the best in the city. The location was perfect too. My only complaint is that the hotel charges for the in-room Nespresso pod coffee. A hotel at this level should include this service. We will return someday simply so we can stay long enough to enjoy the country property and cooking school both of which we missed.,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Mexico,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisHOhio
La Maison Arabe,MaudH_12 wrote a review Jun 2017,50,Cooking Class,A group of us enjoyed a lovely morning cooking class and later ate our efforts. We learnt to make a chicken pastilla and also cookies and a salad which in Morocco often consists of cooked vegetables.    The team that was teaching us was excellent and we had a lot of fun learning to prepare pastilla which many of us had earlier only eaten at restaurants without understanding how to make its parts. We made individual round pastillas. I am now ready to cook at home.

La Maison Arabe,Widya S wrote a review May 2017,50,One of the best dinners out there,We went to the Moroccan restaurant for dinner and it was definitely one of the best foods in town. La Maison Arabe put a twist into the repetitive traditional dishes (which become boring after a day or two) and made them interesting. Out of the good restaurants this was one of the best ones overall.    For appetizers we had the three traditional pastillas (vegetables chicken and lamb). As mains we had the slowly cooked (over coal) lamb stew and couscous with seven vegetables tajine. We would recommend these mains and appetizer. We also had mille feuille lemon cheesecake and lemon tart as desserts. We would recommend the cheesecake and lemon tart for the dessert but not the mille feuille.Service was OK.

La Maison Arabe,Lisa H wrote a review May 2017,50,Worth the Price,We had a suite with a huge room and a private patio. It featured a leather lined walk in closet and a huge modern bathroom. It was in an area of the hotel suitable for people who have mobility problems. The decor was Moroccan chic. Never before have I seen a brass holster for the hair dryer or a silver sleeve for the mineral water.  The room had a small bottle of wine water and Moroccan pastries waiting for us on the coffee table.  The breakfast around the swimming pool was a highlight for me. A Moroccan cook prepared msemmen pancakes and botbot rolls in front of our table. Other than that you name it they had it. The omelette and scrambled eggs were outstanding as were the fresh juices.  I also liked the afternoon tea and the jazz bar. Dinner around the pool featured two musicians improvising on Andalusian themes. The setting was very romantic. I overheard a Francophone couple planning its wedding at the hotel. Now that is the ultimate destination wedding.  The staff helped us with a minor medical problem and presented us with Moroccan cookbook when we left.  This is a fine hotel with a well-deserved reputation for excellence. It is worth every dirham.

La Maison Arabe,MitzouTexas wrote a review May 2017,40,A Lovely Stay . . . quiet amid the hubbub of the Medina,Good hotels and riads all have one characteristic in common. Friendly professional service. La Maison Arabe one of the most popular riads in Marrakech is no exception. Questions are answered promptly and all inquiries are addressed immediately. As with other riads the access to rooms and restaurants can be challenging. Multiple staircases and levels and even an elevator create an air of mystery when searching for the restaurant or even the bar or exits. That's part of the charm of La Maison Arabe. Rooms are well furnished and wifi is readily available. There is a hamman and a minimal hair salon (come with clean hair; there are no facilities for personnel to shampoo.)    The best part of La Maison Arabe? The adjoining classroom set-up for Moroccan cooking lessons. This charming annex was extraordinarily well done on all levels. From the facilities to the instructor(s) and auxiliary staff the entire program could have been placed on a flying Moroccan carpet and whisked away to Manhattan set down in the middle of the city and would function perfectly. Kudos to whoever conceived and executed this cooking school. Attending the class was a highlight of our stay.    One caveat; visitors with difficulties climbing should confirm location of room before accepting. There is only one elevator which only serves one section of the riad. Other parts of the complex must be negotiated through a maze of alcoves levels and stairs.    But then that is the magic of a Riad . . . the mystery of the Medina.,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,Texas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MitzouTexas
La Maison Arabe,sconyers1 wrote a review May 2017,50,Perfect in every way!,"From the moment we arrived last week until we checked out 3 days later our experience at La Maison Arabe was perfect. The staff was attentive to our every need. If we asked for anything the staff replied with ""consider it done"" - and it was! My husband hurt his knee while we were walking in Marrakech and the staff brought ice bags to our room numerous times. When I said I wanted to walk to a pharmacy to buy a knee brace for my husband the front desk manager insisted he would send one of their employees to get the requested item. The bellman delivered the perfect knee brace to our room in 25 minutes time and they only charged us the price of the device. When we arrived we were greeted with a refreshing welcome drink. When we got to our room we were greeted with rose petals scattered throughout the room. Afternoon tea came a few minutes later with a selection of pastries. Their afternoon tea service is phenomenal. And when we departed we were given a small box of pastries and 2 bottles of water for our journey. While at La Maison Arabe my husband and I both took the cooking class and enjoyed the experience tremendously. We also experienced their hammam and spa treatments which were some of the best we have experienced in the world. And we dined at La Maison several times because the food was always fresh and delicious with superior service by all wait staff.

La Maison Arabe,oneluckytraveller wrote a review May 2017,50,Excellent choice!!,There are so many hotel options in marrakech it can be overwhelming. From traditional riads to luxurious hotels....  Being Moroccan I get solicited a lot from friends about where to stay in Marrakech and I always recommend a riad. To me La Maison Arabe really offers the best of both worlds in its authenticity and luxurious set-up.    The boutique feel gives you the assurance that you are given a personalised service whilst still enjoying the luxury and amenities of a grander property. Its location is also key as it is in the North part of the Medina and a short walk to the Koutoubia.    I was traveling solo on this occasion and as a Moroccan woman I felt safe and welcome (you'd be surprised how many properties would turn away a woman travelling alone in Morocco).  The staff are not only attentive but proactive. Front desk is efficient and multi-lingual.  I booked the pickup service from the airport although more expensive than getting a taxi it was hassle free.    The room was really spacious and full of Moroccan character. Very comfortable with a small outside space.    I didn't get to sample the Moroccan breakfast as I stayed there during Ramadan but I did open my fast at the restaurant by the pool and the food was exquisite (and it's not just because I had a bigger appetite lol). Service was very good.    I would stay again but it is quite steep.

La Maison Arabe,tovandi wrote a review May 2017,50,Exemplary in every way!!!!,La Maison Arabe has been one of the best hotels I've stayed in during my extensive travels. It is a small boutique hotel in Marrakesh a ten minute walk to Jamaa el Fnaa and the souk. The building is beautiful a combination of several riads. They have blended these buildings quite seamlessly into one hotel. The decorations and furnishings are lovely. They have a nice pool seating area around the pool lots of little reading nooks all over the hotel and a really great bar. The bartender Rashid is awesome! The service in the hotel also is exemplary! We got there on my husband's birthday. They arranged for a cake for him and sang happy birthday and made our evening very special. They also filled out our departure forms and gave them to us the night before we checked out! They also packed four tagines that we had got at the cooking class and did a fabulous job on that as well. The restaurants in the hotel are great as well.  Our rooms were wonderful. We had a little seating area outside our room and the room itself was spacious and well lit.  We also took a cooking class that they offer. This was a great experience. The class is held in the next building and has a well equipped teaching kitchen. There are several work stations all equipped with a large screen tv on which you can watch the chef and follow her instructions easily. The staff at the cooking class Husna and the chefs Fatima Ameena and Nadira were wonderful. They were friendly informative and very helpful. Our family really enjoyed our stay at La Maison Arabe.

La Maison Arabe,755JLG wrote a review May 2017,50,Way beyond expectations,"Head down an alley that looks like every other alley in the medina of Marrakech and stop at a beautiful wood door. But It is not until you cross the threshold of this door and see what lies behind it that you will be truly impressed. The hotel is a maze of intersecting hallways. There are indoor and open air lounges fountains and beautiful furnishings throughout. No detail is overlooked. The staff is extremely nice and thoughtful. The rooms are spread out through the different levels and corridors so you will not find yourself walking down a hall of rooms. The staff will greet you with a Moroccan mojito which is a cold cocktail of pineapple juice ginger and mint. The room we were assigned is lovely and well appointed. Like many of the hotels inside the medina there are no windows to the outside. All of the windows in the room will probably face an internal courtyard. If this is a problem for you you should stay outside the medina. If I could find one thing to complain about it is that they I think they need to replace the pillows. They are a bit flat. That is it. They have a lovely Jazz lounge that is romantically lit and has a decent selection of wines. I was not feeling well on the second day of our visit and the staff was concerned and offered me herbal tea. The tea was brought to my room by a very kind gentleman who also provided advice for correcting the problem I was having. He said he had some other tea combinations if this version did not soothe my stomach and told me to call the front desk if necessary. We had dinner in the international dining room. Unfortunately we had purchased a tour package that included meals and we found out too late that this was a bad idea. Almost every restaurant we ate in gave us the ""tour"" menu which was the same in every restaurant. Couscous couscous Tangine tangine. After the third or fourth day of this same menu for lunch and dinner you start to get really aggravated. Such was the case at this restaurant as we watched all of these beautiful dishes go by. I had chicken tangine and it was the worst one I had on the entire trip (and I had several. In fact I think I might be a chicken tangine expert now). The restaurant is beautiful just like the rest of the hotel. The tables are arranged on patios on either side of the pool and they had musicians playing light music throughout the meal. Breakfast was also served on these patios and it is a buffet of yogurt fruit meat bread and eggs made to your taste. It was very nice. We had to leave at 5 am to make our flight in Casablanca and the hotel provided breakfast in our room at 4:30. They also filled out customs forms for us and remembered to ask how I was feeling when we checked out. I have to say that staying at La Maison Arabe was one of the highlights of my trip and I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Marrakech.",Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Warwick, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/755JLG

La Maison Arabe,Janet M wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Wonderful and Fantastic,We traveled with another couple and we spent three nights at La Maison Arabe. It was the highlight of our two weeks in Morocco. Several years ago it was listed by Conte Nast magazine as number 5 of the top 30 boutique hotels worldwide. La Maison Arabe is a world class hotel. The rooms are beautifully appointed the beds comfortable and the heavy drapes allow you to sleep in. Each room has a balcony overlooking the beautiful garden which is open to the sky but within the interior of the hotel. The hotel is filled with gorgeous paintings and Moroccan artifacts. You need to wander throughout the public areas of the hotel to find them. They should not be missed. The Moroccan lanterns by Yahya Creations must be seen to be believed. The staff cannot do enough to make your stay perfect. Each employee we interacted with made us feel special. Advance reservations for dinner at the Moroccan restaurant and the 3 Saeveurs restaurant as well as the cooking school are recommended. The food was fabulous. The cost of the room includes a wonderful breakfast buffet and it will hold you until dinner time. The cost also includes an afternoon tea of either Moroccan mint tea or English tea as well as cookies. The hotel can arrange for a tour guide and also for transportation to and from the airport. We highly recommend this hotel. We honestly thought it was probably the most beautiful welcoming hotel that we have every stayed in.

La Maison Arabe,SueB187062 wrote a review Apr 2017,50,An excellent Riad in Marrakech,My husband and I had a short 4 night stay here at the beginning of March. Initially I was a little concerned about staying in a smaller establishment because we are both vegetarian & need a decent choice on the buffet breakfast table. No problem at all with that aspect of things here and there's very little to add because everything about this riad was better than excellent. Staff without exception were wonderful and we took dinner in the restaurant one night. We aren't late eaters & we were the first customers when the restaurant opened at 7.00 pm but by the time we left at around 9.00pm there wasn't a spare table. I suspect some of the diners were non resident so obviously La Maison Arabe has a good reputation for its cooking. We had suite 210 which was adjacent to the Piano Bar (no disturbance whatsoever) and it was fabulous with its own patio and garden along with a table & chairs. We never saw inside any of the other rooms/suites but I imagine the quality is similar throughout the hotel. The location is good too being about a 10 minute walk from the action of Jemaa el Fna square and the souks & if you are claustrophobic it would probably be a better option than staying in one of the riads in the narrow lanes of the souks. Altogether an excellent 4 days spent here.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Preston, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SueB187062

While the bread baked in the mud oven we were given a lesson on the proper preparation of mint tea. The still warm bread was passed around as we drank the just prepared tea. We could have eaten a the entire basket of the delicious bread! We were then directed to a covered outdoor table and we were told about how to season a tangine and about Moroccan cooking. We moved to the indoor cooking lesson kitchen which is set up for classes where each student has their own station complete with a sink burnier and cutting board. All of the necessary ingredients and equipment was at each station and the instructors were at the front at a large station with a video camera and monitor that allowed us to see what they were doing. We were given verbal directions as well as the instructors coming around to check our progress. We made three dishes of a cold salad a hot eggplant and tomato dish and a tangine with vegetables and chicken.

We had our own private courtyard filled with green bushes and plants. the bedroom and bathroom - very spacious and luxurious. the breakfast served pool side- amazing! We loved the Jazz bar. We also enjoyed the cooking class and the royal hammam. However- what made our stay -was the outstanding staff and gracious service by everyone from the bell boy to the managers. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Marakkesh.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Chicago, Illinois",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/poojac49
La Maison Arabe,Richard C wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Blissful escape - sublime relaxation,This hotel was unforgettable from the moment we got in touch to make a booking with them back in November 2016 for our Easter holidays this year. The e-mail service was outstanding with quick and friendly responses to our queries concerning facilities rooms day trips and hammam. Our wishes were anticipated and the hotel was amazing facilitating our transport to and from the airport as well as fast track process (highly recommended despite cost due to very busy airport!) through immigration.    We were notified in advance that we were upgraded to Noor suite - a wonderful surprise. After arriving at the hotel we were escorted down an alleyway to the concealed entrance where we were welcomed with tea and warm genuine hospitality.    We were shown to our room which was amazing - the nicest room I've ever stayed in. It consisted of a large bathroom walk-in dressing room separate toilet bedroom small living room and terrace with covered area all overlooking a central courtyard. There are no views from the room however the vibe is one of utter sanctuary and peace. Even in April it was hot during the day so we took great comfort in lying underneath the umbrella that came with the two outdoor deck chairs to relax on. We found ourselves having dinner outside too with the room service on two occasions because it was just so relaxing to enjoy the comforts of the room following a relaxing hammam in the spa downstairs.    The food and restaurant - sublime. Service was outstanding with gorgeous gardens and swimming pool next to tables. I swum in the pool on several occasions and found that if one did not go at lunch or dinner time it was a wonderful place to relax and cool off. Of course the large swimming pool and gardens owned by the hotel are amazing if you are looking for a day drip outside the city. They are only 15 minutes away by car (goes every hour) and the restaurant by the pool there is fab.    The location of the hotel is outstanding too - only a short walk from the souk. With maps and support from the front office staff we found our way easily around the souk after a few days and very much appreciated their excellent suggestions for meals and day trips. Amazing.    The high speed wifi was the fastest I've ever experienced in my life!    Thank you for an amazing 10 day visit La Maison Arabe. We will definitely be returning!,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Switzerland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D3910DSrichardc

La Maison Arabe,juliecarver wrote a review Apr 2017,50,"If there is a Paradise on Earth, it is La Maison Arabe!",La Maison Arabe is an absolutely amazing boutique riad. I stayed here a single woman from the US for 3 nights in early April and couldn't have been more pleased with my choice. Location is fantastic the staff is amazing the cooking school is state of the art hammam is to die for jazz bar is like something out of your favorite old romantic movie and the rooms are beautiful. I felt so pampered while I stayed here. The staff at the hotel takes care of every little detail... from putting fresh flowers in your room making sure that you have a bottle of water when you go out walking and even giving me a cookbook from the cooking school when I checked out (so unexpected I was very touched!). It's easy to be good very hard to be great. La Maison Arabe is GREAT.

There was ample sitting areas and also a separate private rooftop space with lounging areas and a hot tub. The room was truly amazing and luxurious with a very comfortable Moroccan decor. In walking around the riad you'd think it was a small place but it had a decent pool and different sitting corners and dining options. Certainly was the most comfortable and enjoyable place our family stayed at.

La Maison Arabe,K83XKstephenc wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Absolutely Incredible- 5*,I honestly cannot begin to describe how incredible our stay at La Maison Arabe was over the Easter Weekend. I have enjoyed it so much that I almost don't want to rate and recommend it as highly as I am about to for fear that it will no longer be such a hidden gem.    In the run-up to arrival the team at the hotel were incredibly helpful in arranging (and moving on multiple occasions) bookings for the Spa and the two restaurants at the hotel. Each time I replied by email I was met with the same incredibly helpful response from Mostafa and the rest of the team. They even arranged to have a chauffeur collect us in a spacious and brand new vehicle.    Upon arrival at the hotel the staff were again great. We arrived 4hrs before out check in time and not only did they allow us to check in early but we were also upgraded to a better room overlooking the Garden. The front of house staff were amazing and took us for a guided tour around all the nooks and crannies of the hotel and showed us exactly where we needed to go for things like the Spa and Breakfast. The gentleman even off the top of his head what treatments we were booked in for and on which days.    The room was magnificent. Lovely and cool with a breath-taking view of the pool and the gardens. The room itself had a huge double bed and a bathroom big enough for a small family. The minibar was incredibly well stocked and there was some wine and local pastries to welcome us.    We dined in both the heritage La Maison Arabe Restaurant and the Les Trois Saveurs during our stay and found both to be equally great. The al fresco dining and general ambience of the courtyard (Les Trois Saveurs) made the dinner their a little more fun however the rich history of the old restaurant means its a must visit also.    Every day our room was turned down at the perfect time (around 10pm) after we had left for dinner. Each night fresh towels and bath robes were provided and the bathroom restocked. The hotel cleaning staff were just as superb as the rest of the staff.    The Spa at La Maison Arabe is also sublime. From the greeting you receive by the front of house lady to the members of the spa team. Every one of them was courteous helpful informative and exceptional at their job. We enjoyed 2x Hamman Beldi's and a Deep Tissue Massage each. I cannot speak highly enough of the facilities and the staff in the spa.    The front of house staff were incredibly helpful throughout our stay. From arranging cabs to arranging transfer’s to arranging tour guides to moving restaurant bookings. No request fell on deaf-ears and nothing slipped through the cracks. The team were all simply fantastic. *I would definitely take the hotel up on their offer of a guide. We had a gentleman called Hamza who was fantastic. He taught English and has lived in Marrakech his whole life so was amazing for the 5hrs we used him to take us around the souks sights and shops. He made us feel very safe and we learnt so much from him too.    Possibly the greatest hidden treasure of this hotel is The Country Club. Hidden outside the Medina and on the opposite side of the city. The country club is an amazing escape from the hustle and bustle of the old city. Set amongst acres of lush gardens water features herb gardens cooking school.... The Country Club can only be described as an Oasis. The hotel lays on shuttle service to and from the country club and the drivers can be flexible if it is quiet. We found ourselves escaping to the country club for part of three days of our five day trip. The staff at the country club were possibly the best staff we experienced in the whole stay. Specifically Mohammed who was the most warm and welcoming person I have ever had the privilege of meeting in all my years traveling the world for work and pleasure. On one of the days I had an upset stomach and Mohammed brought me a traditional Moroccan remedy for upset stomach - tea of course consisting of Thyme Rosemary Lemon and Ginger. It really did settle it and it’s certainly something I will be remembering for future reference.    All in all La Maison Arabe is perfect. Nothing fell short of our expectations or wishes. I will be strongly recommending a visit to all my friends and colleagues. I am also certain my girlfriend and I will be returning there ourselves sometime in the very near future.    Thanks to all of the team for making our stay so spectacular.

First at all needs to be mentioned the service: you feel after few hours already as being part of a family. Maybe is the size of the hotel definitely is also the character of the locals very open and helpful. Definitely this place is unique. We stayed in many many hotels world-wide and we need to recognise that this one was an experience on his own. This hotel offers you also the possibility to access to a great facility at the outskirts of Marrakesh there surrounded by a great vegetation you will find a fantastic pool as well a Kitchen school surrounded by a nice vegetable garden.  Listen to the great recommendations that the front office will made. This hotel is located few steps away from the souk. You will enjoy to get lost in this labyrinth.  Another great experience was the gastronomic Workshop that this hotel offer to their customers but also well know also for external visitors.

We stayed in Room 220 which had the benefit of a small but very private courtyard which was extremely useful if we decided at the end of a days sightseeing to enjoy a private supper by candlelight. One of the reasons we selected this hotel was the advertised cookery school . We naturally anticipated a higher level of cuisine . This  however  turned out to be a short demonstration in preparing a tagine. Having said that the food  which we enjoyed around the main pool was quite adequate.

You feel like you are back in the days of the Arabian nights. I believe that the hotel is made up of numerous old houses so there are lots of stairs that you have to climb to get to the breakfast room tearoom baths and in our case to our room. The hotel has several lovely courtyards and our room had a private courtyard. Our room was spacious with a desk a nice sized tv a large closet with safe a comfortable bed an extra sitting chair. The courtyard had two chairs and a table and one evening I enjoyed my afternoon tea which is offered by the hotel each day in our private courtyard. The bathroom had a tiled vanity and a tub shower combo with a half glass door. There was a good hairdryer sufficient plugs for our electronic devices wifi and a room air conditioner unit. Friends who were traveling with us had a balcony and two sinks in their large bathroom. Each room is unique in this riad. The haman area is lovely and we enjoyed a delightful bath and massage......just the right touch. The staff was very friendly and attentive.

Even before arriving the staff of the hotel was attentive and responsive we had to change the dates of our reservation twice and the staff helped us via email and made our changes with great disposition.    We booked the transport from the airport and it was super convenient. It is a very well known hotel so even if you take a regular taxi you shouldn't have any trouble finding it. But the price of the transport is similar to a regular taxi so make your life easier and book it.    The hotel is beautiful. It is just what you would be expecting from Morocco. It is elegant and every detail shows there is careful planning behind. We loved the traditional lamps and fresh flowers everywhere.    The rooms are also beautiful. We got an upgrade to a pool view room that was fantastic. Our only note to improve would be the water pressure on the shower. But it is nothing major.    The restaurant is great. We originally intended to have dinner only once to try it but we liked it so much we ate there almost every night during our stay. We liked that the menu was traditional but also had innovative dishes. In regards to breakfast we liked it too but we wished it would have more variety. The location of the restaurant is perfect. It is next to a pool which makes it very charming. We loved the musicians for dinner.    We especially liked how the staff were attentive through out our stay. For example when we were going to take a taxi for dinner they would tell us which price to expect (always ask the taxi driver the price of the ride before you get in!). Another example we had to leave early for a tour (6am) and the staff arranged breakfast in our room and made sure we left with bottles of water for us and even our tour guide. All of the staff was nice attentive and with a happy attitude.    A tip: do a cooking class. We recommend it highly! Our class was in the country club which was beautiful and the facilities for the class are amazing. The class started at 9am and finished at 2 when we ate what we cooked. We learned how to cook a chicken tagine make bread two salads and a small dessert. The class is entertaining the ""dada"" or chef was wonderful and the instructions easy to follow.    Overall we loved the hotel. We would not even search for other options if we return to Marrakesh.",Date of stay: February 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Geneva, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ValeriaTH

I was delighted to have chosen La Maison Arab as my place of accommodation. The room was exceptional the food out of this world and the facility sensational. However it was the staff that made this place so special. Everyone treated me like I were a guest at their home. Worth noting the impeccable treatment provided by Mr. Adil a true gentleman.

It's located at the edge of the Medina but you're in a complete sanctuary when you enter Maison Arabe. Every single member of the staff is friendly and helpful. Special call out to Adil the front desk manager who was just impeccable in his style manner and knowledge. The hotel is beautifully decorated and the food is exquisite. We had a junior suite for a couple and teen and it was perfect. I've reviewed several restaurants hotels etc but I've never given a 5 rating until now. Would give it a 10 if I could.

La Maison Arabe,Tucmar wrote a review Feb 2017,50,First Rate Boutique Hotel,Experience old school villa living in the Medina. In Marrakech you could stay in a luxury modern international hotel in the modern part of town or stay here at a truly first class facility close to the Souk and that has all the facilities that one could want while getting the experience of how it was like living as a Sultan. Rooms are large and well appointed with flat screen TVs large tub with shower faucet minibar and a balcony. Included breakfast is outstanding and offers eggs made to order plus an array of meats. cheeses pastries breads fruits and fresh juices. Facility has a heated pool spa and cooking school. The half day cooking class is outstanding with topnotch instructors that help you prepare a meal in a modern kitchen with your own stove and sink. Your lunch is served in an outstanding rooftop setting. The two dining rooms and Jazz Bar are first rate and very scenic. The food is catered to tourist taste as you will learn if you attend the cooking school where you will experience the true taste of real spiced home cooking. Staff is the friendliest and most attentive that I have ever met in the country. The whole hotel is tastefully appointed with the finest décor. The only negative I could think of is that the facility is near a Mosque and you could be awaken by the Call to Pray at early hours.,Date of stay: February 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Tucson, AZ",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tucmar
La Maison Arabe,Kanita wrote a review Feb 2017,50,"Wonderful Ambiance, Delicious Food",Our hotel recommended this restaurant for dinner on our first night and what a find! The decor is upscale and beautiful. The dining area is super cozy with nice lighting. They had live music during dinner (a duo singing and playing local string instruments). We started with the salad which was a variety of tapas served with bread. My favorite was the pumpkin puree...totally yummy....but they were all delish. I had a veggie tagine and my date enjoyed a chicken tagine. Both were wonderful. Service was impeccable. We loved this place so much that we went back again.

La Maison Arabe,Jackie K wrote a review Feb 2017,50,Tagine Cooking Class; Hammam Spa Experience,While visiting Marrakech my friend and I booked a tagine cooking class through La Maison Arabe. The gentlemen that led us through the class along with the kitchen staff were extremely knowledgeable friendly and attentive. We cooked a chicken tagine true to form and experienced a true traditional high tea experience. I learned a lot - and would go back in a heartbeat the next time I visit Marrakesh. Immediately following the class my friend and I went to the hammam spa located on-site. The spa was relaxing and culturally unique (for me as a hammam spa is much different from a Korean or American spa experience). Would highly recommend either/ both of these experiences!

La Maison Arabe,IanS321984 wrote a review Feb 2017,50,An oasis of colonial calm,My wife and I just returned from a wonderful week's stay at La Maison Arabe and are already making plans to go back!  We had considered a lot of other riads but this one stood out from the pack - the history the decor and the colonial feel. Credit to my wife for finding it!  In Marrakech a place to escape the hustle and bustle is very important and La Maison Arabe offered us an oasis of calm with all the trimmings of French colonial decadence and fabulous local cuisine.  It has a boutique feel with very good personal attention - members of staff are great at making guests feel special.  The restaurants are fantastic and are very popular with non-residents too which considering the variety on offer in the city says a lot. There's also a very cool jazz bar with live piano music.  Relaxing by the heated pool was bliss and the private Country Club and garden on the other side of town is a huge bonus. We also did one of the cooking classes which was a top notch set-up and we'd highly recommend it to others.  Special thanks to Adil and his team for all their assistance and for making us feel right at home.,Date of stay: February 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IanS321984

Everyone went out of their way to be sure our needs were met at every turn - including providing a phone to be able to reach the hotel at any time if we were to become lost while exploring the city. The hotel is also well located near one of the main gates making it convenient to go out for an easy morning run. We took advantage of a cooking class and highly recommend it as well as a visit to the Jazz Bar where Rashid welcomed us and shared his recipe and tchnique for making his signature welcome drink. The hotel manages to balance old world elegance and hospitality with modern convenience and comforts along with making you feel as tho you have been known to them for many years. Value was exceptional.

With 26 rooms spa pool and two restaurants plus a fine jazz bar where you can also eat this is a great choice for everyone. The hotel is furnished with more classical Moroccan art and furniture with lots of nooks and crannies to spend a few quiet moments should you need them. The entire team; restaurant reception concierge bar and spa are completely focused on making your visit the best possible. After a night of sickness my friend was offered a special ginger tea to help her recover and the staff continued to ask her how she was feeling the following day. We enlisted the concierges help in arranging all our excursions (3 hour guided walk carriage ride cookery lesson balloon trip evening spectacular ""show"") and everything was timed perfectly with wonderful taxi drivers / guides.

La Maison Arabe,sang c wrote a review Feb 2017,50,Being Home in Marrakech,"I'm not sure where to begin with La Maison Arabe (LMA).    From the moment you walk in the door you're greeted with someone who already knows your name a 5 minute check-in process which happens while seated on sofas over a drink and then a tour of the property (which is very helpful as the hotel is a beautiful maze) before settling in the room. It was an excellent and efficient process.    Food room people - everything is terrific - nothing more I can really say. But perhaps the experience best summed up in one encounter. We enlisted the help of the most kind and helpful concierge (front desk agent - I'm so sorry to have forgotten his name) who guided us through the many options and places to visit and then after sending us off to dinner for a couple hours explained how and why he recommended each of them and different options to go about visiting these places.    We settled on a 3 day visit to the desert with a recommended tour company (Deep South Travel - also excellent...ask for Amin as your guide and you will not be disappointed). Even though we were going to be staying at another hotel after returning from the desert LMA kept our luggage so we could travel light. Upon returning from the desert to pick up our luggage we were greeted by the same concierge whose delight in hearing about our travels really made me feel like I was coming home. Just superb.

Would have loved to have stayed longer. There is little I can add to previous reports. The hotel itself is exquisite the decor tasteful and the staff could not do more to help. All of this is done in a very understated natural fashion and with a warm smile. It does appear that the staff love their work and their efforts are genuine.    We enjoyed the 3hour cookery school class where we met a lovely french couple. The class was conducted in both french and english - which if anything added to the experience - in a very advanced and well thought out cookery school.

The minute we arrived the service levels were superb from the pick up at the airport from Abdellah to the lovely greeting at the front desk from Nourredine. The hotel itself is a beautiful Riad we were upgraded to a deluxe suite which was very spacious and exquisitely laid out. We ate out on a couple of occassions but the food could not compare to the in house restaurant Les Trois Saveurs. We ate here twice and on both occasions the food was superb. The restaurant has a beautiful poolside location and it is where they also serve breakfast. Our favourites were the Lamb couscous Fish Tagine and the Morrocan Pancakes at breakfast with a honey and almond paste. The service at dinner was again exceptional with nothing being a problem thanks Mohammed.  Being in the centre of the Medina meant it was the ideal location to visit the souks and the Jemaa El fnaa square. It is very easy to get lost so make sure you get your bearings from the start.

First of all it is a gorgeous place to be both visually and in the olfactory sense. The quality of the rooms is excellent with beautiful furnishings ornaments and artwork in every room and the public areas are charming with a very warm swimming pool at the moment and an absolutely beautiful hammam and spa with fantastic people looking after you and highly skilful staff. It has absolutely excellent wifi everywhere and the usual business facilities. Both restaurants are excellent in terms of food and the setting of the Trois Saveurs by the pool is beautiful both at breakfast and for dinner. In short it is a lovely place to be which combines the old and new.  But it has an X factor. The staff. They are efficient attentive friendly playful have a sense of humour and make your stay truly memorable. We turn up for a few days each year and within minutes of arrival we've relaxed and started to be looked after.

La Maison Arabe,Battered Orange S wrote a review Jan 2017,50,Understated Elegance - Full Debrief,Just home after 5 days here (mid-Jan). I have been thinking about how to provide the most helpful and informational review of La Mason Arabe - something that didn’t replicate everyone else’s “oasis in the medina” vague (but great) accolades. Because there are so many riads and resorts in Marrakech from which to choose. I was completely overwhelmed with the choices as I suspect many are. I ultimately went with La Maison Arabe because a few years back we had put a small group of media VIPs into the property and they raved. So here goes…    1. Location - easier than many riads in terms of access. No circuitous little alleys to navigate. Main road just down a little alleyway where the entrance is situated. Suggest you have hotel arrange for airport pick-up - nicer experience than cab and not expensive. Location very central and easy to walk into the medina via a couple different routes. Area feels very safe. I think we noticed a security guy around just as a precaution but honestly no issue with area or safety.    2. Property itself - this is a larger riad - 26 rooms I believe - or thereabouts across a couple of different buildings (attached) and different levels. Lots of staircases nooks and crannies (often with a fireplace) to get comfy. Feels like being in someone’s private country home. Doesn’t feel too big at all - feels just right. Front desk right there as you walk in off the alley with its sofas and cozy fireplace. Downstairs to the right is the jazz bar where you can tuck yourself away for an evening of great live music and convivial company - more on staff later. Small little patio in this side where we were sat down and were offered drinks while being elegantly taken through the check-in process. A lovely touch. Up the staircase from the little cozy lobby and you connect to the second building via a charming little hallway leading into a nook with a couch and warm lit fireplace and candles (January afterall). Decor is in very good taste. A previous review had mentioned that it looked a bit in need of freshening with tattered rugs as an example. I would disagree. The style is understated - clearly Moroccan - but homey and elegant. It doesn’t necessarily feel modern doesn’t scream barefoot chic as several places here do. But when you start to look at the details - the light fixtures around the pool with the logo on them. The rugs in the hallway the colors of saffron and paprika. The warm leather doors. The framed photographs. You get it.    The pool area is where the international restaurant is located and where you have breakfast. It is beautifully done and at night alit with about a thousand votive candles! Beyond beautiful. It was too cold for swimming when we were there and I do wonder if it would be a bit strange to swim when diners are right there. Maybe just a little awkward. And potentially loud and disturbing to diners. Not sure. Also no sun loungers by the pool - you go up to the sundeck which is a quick set of stairs away. Mainly tables set up around the pool. Which is likely why La Maison Arabe has its sister property the “country club” which is all about the pool thing. A 15-min shuttle ride the hotel will take you there for a day of relaxing. We didn’t get to it but I imagine its well worth it if lounging by the pool is in order.    3. Room - we were in room 213 - I believe a standard room - can’t remember if they upgraded us a level but it was spacious enough and included a large private and quiet balcony. Colors in rusts and beiges like the hotel. Large comfortable bed. Beautiful embroidered linens with the logo. Large tiled bathroom with two sinks large tub and bidet! We had a late check-out so they were kind enough to allow us to have another room for that day which is so quirky with a big beehive-shaped wall in the center. My impression is that every room has a unique style and charm. The rooms overlooking the pool have balconies right alongside each other so possibly not as private as you’d like but lovely to overlook the pool area which is stunning.    4. Staff - this is a common accolade in the reviews and for good reason. I will say that initially I was a bit off-put because I had read many reviews on other riads and many complimented the immediate welcome email upon booking in. We did not receive that from La Maison Arabe however when I emailed to organize airport pickup their response was prompt warm and courteous. A previous review had mentioned staff being discreet yet always anticipating guest’s needs or wants. That’s what we experienced. Each time we walked past the front desk for example they stood up and greeted us by name of course. I liked that they stood up! Those details again. And I swear we never once saw the housekeeper who cleaned our room and then somehow knew exactly when we left the room each evening - no matter for how long - to sneak back in to turn it down. Warm and attentive restaurant staff - always smiling and greeting and never obtrusive. And then there’s Rachid the host with the most - bartender and raconteur extraordinaire - whose reputation proceeds him. Again like the beautifully-trained staff - Rachid intuitively knows when to chime and and chat and when to hang back and provide space. He went out of his way to make us feel welcome - and even went to the trouble to organize a special dessert with a candle (celebrating our 20th anniv) which was delivered to us at the bar. We felt part of the family - as though this was our bar too! And the piano player! No words to describe how his playing enhanced this atmosphere. And another lovely lovely man. We wound up here every night and was our favorite time to sit and relax in this clubby comfy lounge listening to wonderful music and chatting with these wonderful people. Talk about treasures!    5. Food - breakfasts good. Lots of selections. We went for the Moroccan pancakes each day which proved to be a highlight and such fun to see the woman making them in the traditional fashion. We had dinner twice - once Moroccan food - highly recommend the assortment of Moroccan salads - and once European food - lamb - which was divine. Good wine selection - do try Moroccan wines. We loved the El Mogador (I believe) white wine - a little bit of fermentation and so so good. Had it each day! Dinner lovely accompanied by live music around the pool. Pretty amazing.    6. Spa and cooking class - must do both. Hamam is stunning - dark and warm like a lovely cocoon. I did the Royal Spa treatment and was just the perfect way to start. Highly recommend. We also did the cooking class which like everything else La Maison Arabe does was first rate. Wonderful woman Waffa who was so interesting and informative of cultural traditions and influences in the traditional food. Kitchen was immaculate and modern and extremely impressive. Lovely dada to show us how to prepare the two salads and chicken tagine we made which we then got to enjoy. We opted for the wine pairing addition which I highly recommend.    Last thing - hotel arranged for a private guide for us for the first two days and we recommend it. Cost of 30 euro and we had a lovely gentleman who really showed us the sights and also introduced us to the best restaurant Cafe Arabe where we had lunch on the rooftop every day we were there.

La Maison Arabe,Ask n wrote a review Jan 2017,50,Service like you have always wanted,The service is simply exemplary. Not intrusive but if you raise your eyes for something you need bang they are there with what you want when you want it. The property is very well done an the level of cleanliness and maintenance exceptional. Furniture and decor touches are also well-considered and of high quality. Restaurant fantastic - wine selection great. The staff are multi-lingual cute and fun.. The jazz bar is a hoot fantastic bar staff and a great fun pianist. We had a lot of fun in there. Location is great and an easy walk to the souks. The history of the property is fascinating being one of the first if not the first riyad and foreign operated restaurant behind the ramparts in the old city. The attached cooking school is also worth a try. I can only recommend it as highly as possible and as frustrating as it is for a critical reviewer like me I just can't find fault with the place.,Date of stay: January 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Paris, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PS_S_s3452

La Maison Arabe,Hillary W wrote a review Jan 2017,50,Arab Hospitality at its Finest.,Bottom Line Up Front - Overall one of the best hotel experiences of my life. I am a very fussy person - I can complain about almost anything. This place is absolutely flawless - stay here!    To go into more detail I had booked another hotel in Marrakech (the top rated riad on tripadvisor) and they cancelled my reservation only a few weeks before the trip. They suggested I try La Maison Arabe and I am so thoroughly delighted they did because I think it turned out to be much much much better! I will go through all of the highlights point by point:    - Airport pick-up. The price was right the driver spoke English and was so welcoming. Definitely worth it to avoid the typical airport hassle.    - So intimate. I was concerned that it might be too large - 26 rooms as opposed to the usual 4 or so of a typical riad. But this wonderful place has all of the amenities of a larger hotel without feeling large and in fact quite the opposite.    - Gorgeous room. Everything was perfect - the towels were fluffy the bed comfortable and fireplace inviting (they will build a fire on request). Nightly turn down service - simply the best.    - Jazz bar. You must try one of Rashid's Morojitos and get a lesson in how to make them. What a host he is!    - Moroccan restaurant. What a treat - we went two nights in a row. I will write a separate review for the restaurant but it was so incredible. Between the lovely local music and the delicious food I felt we had been transported a million miles from home. So exquisite we went two nights in a row.    - Spa. The hammam is a must-do. The price is reasonable and the environment so welcoming and warm. It was pristine and the staff was completely professional and not at all pushy.    - Pool restaurant/breakfast. Perfect perfect. The service was great the food is great. No complaints and just abundant praise. We enjoyed many bottles of Domaine de Sahari Rose out next to the pool. Heaven on earth.    - Guided tour of Marrakech. The hotel arranged with essentially no notice a wonderful guided walking tour of Marrakech. The guide spoke perfect English listened to what we wanted to do and was not even remotely pushy. We wanted to do some shopping and he took us to great places. When some of the places were too expensive he immediately sensed it and took us to places more reasonable (with basically the same merchandise.)    - Comptoir Darna. La Maison Arabe suggested we go to dinner and the show at Comptoir Darna. We almost didn't go because we thought it might be a little cheesy. I am SO SO SO glad we did. This was the best decision we made while in Marrakech. The show was AMAZING. And we had the best seat in the house thanks to La Maison Arabe.    Every aspect of this hotel was amazing and I am so very grateful to them for their hospitality. Marrakech is incredible in its own right but this hotel is the reason I will return. The staff immediately became like family and I could not be more thankful to them for showing us such a wonderful time.,Date of stay: January 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Alexandria, Virginia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hillarywaldron
La Maison Arabe,Patrick B wrote a review Jan 2017,50,Traditonal excellence in service is never outdated,We travelled to Marrakech for a mid Winter break in the first week of January. We chose to stay at La Maison Arabe on the recommendation of friends. We expected a nice small hotel in the Medina but we were taken aback at the excellence of the service and the quality of all aspects of La Maison.    From the moment we arrived until we left we were cared for by the dedicated team at La Maison Arabe. We loved our room overlooking the pool and courtyard restaurant. We enjoyed the Jazz Bar for relaxation. The food in both the traditional Moroccan restaurant and the contemporary courtyard restaurant was excellent.    The hotel desk arranged a tour guide to the Medina. It was the best way to be introduced to the Souks which are daunting for first timers.    The highlight of our visit was the cookery school. This is housed nearby and has a fully equipped kitchen for about 30 people. The session was informative and relaxed. We had great fun both with the presenters and the other participants. We learned how to cook with a tagine and make Moroccan salads. At the end we got certificates of excellence for our efforts.    La Maison Arabe has its own Hammam and spa which we did not have time to enjoy. They also have a retreat with a swimming pool which is accessed by a free shuttle bus.    Our trip to Marrakech was a wonderful experience. La Maison Arabe is the ideal riad for its location facilities and standards of excellence. They claim a rich heritage of former guests including Winston Churchill but the real selling point is the way they look after their guests today.,Date of stay: January 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Omagh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patrickbW4937BA

La Maison Arabe,mustafa8662017 wrote a review Jan 2017,50,"Exceptional experience, can't go wrong with this place",My wife and I found La Maison Arabe on Tripadvisor while planning our three day visit to Morocco from the United States. Not knowing much about Mororcco we were a bit nervous about picking a place just based on Tripadvisor ratings.    I must say that we couldn't have picked anything better than this hotel. It was truly exceptional. I've traveled extensively and have been SPG Platinum for several years. No hotel I've ever stayed at compares to the authenticity hospitality comfort and aesthetic sense of this place. They make you feel as if the entire staff is just dedicated to you and it takes your mind to a different place.

La Maison Arabe,CLM1947 wrote a review Jan 2017,50,Simply terrific!,"We stayed at the Maison Arabe for 6 nights at the start of January 2017 and it was one of the best hotel experiences we have ever had (and we travel a lot). The building itself is beautiful -- especially the breakfast area around the pool. The food was great. Our room was really nice -- spacious well equipped quiet and clean. But above all the staff were fantastic. Always polite helpful and friendly -- every one of them. We had bad colds during our stay (my wife in particular had a really nasty and pervasive cough) and the front office kept offering ""special"" hot drinks with mint lime juice cinnamon and ginger to help her and were always asking how she was doing. We were both so impressed with the care and attention. While we were happy to finally be heading home to shake our illness we knew that we would miss the hotel and its great staff.

First the service is outstanding! They remember every guests name and make you feel very welcomed. We arrived very early for check in and besides just taking our bags they sat us down for breakfast. (The breaky is fantastic as well).    The hotel is beautifully decorated and the two restaurants and jazz bar are great with good food and musicians. (Didnt use the spa but it looks pretty)    We were upgraded from a normal room to a junior suite. The room was spacious and bed was comfortable.    It is close to the medina which is where you want to be.    If you have a chance book in for a cookibg course the dadas there are great and the facility is very high tech and clean. You even get a free tagine!    This is one of my favourite hotel stays,Date of stay: January 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Australia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amygH4552PQ

La Maison Arabe,Graham J wrote a review Jan 2017,50,Absolutely wonderful!,La Maison Arabe is a place of calm and serenity in the middle of the frenetic city of Marrakech. Behind the entrance which cannot be found easily along a back street you would never think of going down unless you knew where this hotel was you get everything you could possibly wish for with fantastic staff and a great setting for your stay in the city.You are important from the moment you walk in to the minute you leave and possibly after. The rooms are well proportioned with balconies overlooking the central courtyard and small swimming pool. The food is varied and typical of a hotel of this high standard but of course this is reflected in the price. The hammam & spa is excellent and just what a weary traveler needs when in Marrakech.

Additionally they did an excellent job setting us up with a tour guide to the Atlas Mountains and had a staff member walk us to our restaurant reservations as it is easy to get lost in the narrow alleys.

La Maison Arabe,Louise B wrote a review Jan 2017,50,Maison ADORABLE,This is hands down one of the nicest hotels I have ever had the pleasure of staying in. From start to finish the experience was just fantastic. After a day in the souks it was a little cocoon amidst the hussle and bussle of the Medina.    After a trip down the coast of Morocco I stayed in La Maison Arabe with some friends for a weekend while we explored the wonders of Marrakesh.    The HOTEL BUILDING itself was just beautiful... the photos on the website honestly do not do it justice. The mix of old world and new design works so well... its so perfectly cosy in every way. Its also perfectly located close to the Medina and just a short hop to the airport (only 70 MAD in a street taxi).    The FOOD is second to none. We were lucky enough to eat in both Le Restaurant and Les Trois Saveurs while we were there each one equally delicious. I was only sorry I didn't have enough time to do the cookery course (but delighted to receive a delightful gift of a very special cookery book on our departure :-)).    The SPA is simply idyllic. A true sanctuary in every sense of the word. I would have spent more time there if I could but it was great to get fitted in for a last minute hammam before I left - it was divine!    And finally the STAFF....what can I say? I have genuinely never come across a more welcoming and accommodating hotel staff in all my travels. From the minute we stepped into the hotel we were waited on hand and foot. They organised (and negotiated!) all our guides and taxi rides fetched painkillers for one of our party that was sick they even filled out our exit cards to save us time at the airport...basically attended to our every whim! I couldn't say enough nice things about each and every person working there. A shining example of customer service!

La Maison Arabe,0jwo wrote a review Jan 2017,50,Storybook hotel,This hotel is out of a storybook. Pictures don't do it justice. It feels very old world classy.    From the decor to the staff you feel like you are in a traditional Moroccan Riad for sure.    It is about a 10 minute walk to Jamaa El Fena square and 15 minute walk to Gueliz. The restaurants are five star as well. I highly recommend the beef fillet at the international restaurant. The Moroccan restaurant is one of the best in town and very romantic.    We took cooking classes on the property as well and that was truly a cut above the rest. We got to eat our own cooking on the top of the hotel after we were done. We also had a patio in our room overlooking the square.    The rooms are charming and they use keys instead of keycards to get in the room. Breakfast buffet was also great!

La Maison Arabe,Icannotremember wrote a review Jan 2017,50,ten star riad,I don't think La Maison Arabe needs any more 5 star reviews...  ... so I'll give it 10.  We had to book a different riad over New Year. (Very few rooms left at this time of year so take note!) This first place was dingy and unloved and we were so happy to find ourselves staying for our last two nights in this beautiful hotel hidden in an alleyway in the heart of the town.  The food was delicious; both dinner and breakfast plenty of choice; no need to go further afield for meals. Now my husband is urging me to make the lamb dish he loved (slow cooked with preserved lemons in a clay pot) and the freshly cooked Morrocan breakfast pancakes served with butter and honey. The live oud and guitar music at dinner time was wonderful. Icing on the cake.  The room we were given (215 on the second floor) was small but full of light. (A steepish climb to reach it and no lift so not suitable for those with difficulties.) The mattress was firm and comfortable. Good quality linen.  Plenty of hot water and towels in the bathroom.  The staff were kind friendly and helpful. When we checked out they even handed us our embarkation cards duly filled in! Couldn't fault anything.  Without doubt when we return to Marrakech we will book La Maison Arabe.

This was well matched by the ambience and excellence of the services and facilities available. There is a beautiful courtyard with well decorated interior and the unbelievably well heated swimming pool offers a suitable focus to the restaurant/outdoor breakfast area. The Spa area looks idyllic and includes a Hammam. There are two restaurants - one surrounding the pool offers international cuisine and the second in another area of the hotel concentrates on Moroccan cuisine.

La Maison Arabe,Gareth S wrote a review Jan 2017,40,Hotel is a little tired and needs some management help but the spa is exceptional,"We went to the hotel the day before we had a spa/hammam booked and had also two nights on hold for a few days ahead. We were guided to the outside terrace which is unremarkable - perhaps uninspired is better - and the service modest at best. Much of the hotel shows clear signs of a glamorous past and a truly charming space but with worn seats red almost shag carpet runners on the stairs and other tell tale signs that a little upgrade ought to be in the works. Also the staff while very friendly and charming are suffering from neglect of management in my opinion. While we were on the terrace we say many guests simply waiting to be served without any success in an otherwise empty vacant terrace area with plastic chairs. We decided at the moment not to keep our booking for the hotel stays but to still try the spa/hammam experience we had reserved for the next day.    By the way we tried Rochid's Mocohito - a play on a Mojito - and it was awesome! So I highly recommend.    The next day we returned at 3:45pm sharp for our 4:00 pm spa appointment as we were emailed and told not to be late. We were guided to the same terrace and told out appointment was not until 4:00pm. We waiting until 4:05 pm when we were offered tea - which we accepted. By 4:20 pm we decided to leave - which we witnessed other customers doing - one who had apparently been waiting 30 minutes for his tea without success. As we were leaving a staff member asked where we were going and I said I resented being told not to be late (so we grabbed a taxi instead of walking) only to be asked to wait long after our appointment and we still didn't know when our spa was. So we were directed to the spa.    Here is where the experience turned on its head. The bill for was around $200 for two people and we had the hammam and spa for my wife and me. The spa is magnificent. It is one of the most beautiful and charming spaces for a spa we have enjoyed around the world. The ambiance is magnificent the lighting candles water effects service staff and quality of the services were a ten out of ten. The leather chill seats we waited on were a little worn but this was the only negative and it is nitpicking.    This hammam/spa experience is not to be missed. Not just for the value but for the pure excellence of the execution. What this taught me is that the property has the potential to be so much more than it is and it is a fault of leadership. Management should be sent to a world class hotel with a spa to learn how the experience should start from the moment you enter the property door and not the moment you enter the spa within the property. The manner in which you are greeted the formula for enhancing the guest experience and the logistics will all be vastly improved by sending the leadership team to the nearby Four Seasons for a class. Truthfully a property like the Four Seasons spends a huge amount of money training moving staff around and researching the most effective marketing and customer experience action steps and a small boutique like La Maison Arabe would benefit hugely from adopting what they learn from the best in the world or one of the comparable properties with a similar international depth of experience. The front desk and greeting process is the most important.    For the hotel I suggest that while it looks very nice that there are many properties in Marrakech that would give the property a run for the money - there are great locations in abundance. As for the spa - no matter where you stay - an indulgent afternoon here will be a highlight of your trip and while I am very blunt and specific about our impression of the hotel in total the spa is exceptional.    Lastly I am fair I believe in my comments. Rooms here are $200 - $800 - and up here and so they need to operate not at an ordinary level but at a high level of excellence. With just a little bit of management sharpening and maybe a few new cushions and a little decoration in the centre of the terrace to give it a ""heart"" the property is only a few feet from going from ""very good"" (as I rated it) to excellent. I hope that team takes these few steps to improve the already well suited polite and personable associates and staff who work there.",Date of stay: January 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Toronto, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garethseltzer

As soon as you enter inside you can feel how magic a place in Marrakech can be despite the external appereance. The restaurant is fantastic the location is wonderful... ask for a table around the small pool and relax hearing the soft moroccan live music. The food is something special as the standing service. The price is a bit high but totally justified by the high quality of food and standard of both service and location.

La Maison Arabe,GUNERI U wrote a review Dec 2016,50,Unforgettable Birthday,My wife and I stayed four nights at La Maison Arabe. It was the most memorable stay of our ten days trip to Morocco. The Riad/Hotel is a real gem in the old Medina. The high taste can be witnessed in details at the public areas restaurants rooms in everywhere. Atmosphere reflecting (without exaggerating) the culture lighting heating artworks amenities comfort of the room and bed were superb. The variety and taste of food (hot and cold) at the breakfast buffet were good. The hammam spa facilities were tastefully decorated. We took 90 min. Royal Session. It was divine. We had an excellent birthday dinner at Moroccan Restaurant with our friends. Food was best between the other restaurants we tried in Marrakech. All were delicious and artfully presented. The trio playing Mediterrenean music was a feast to our ears.

The hotel service was top notch. We arrived early in the morning and were immediately taken to breakfast (which is excellent) and then allowed very early into our room. The staff gave us great recommendations and booked transport to and from the airport a medina guide and made dinner reservations. We were departing earlier than they opened the breakfast service so had it delivered to the room at no cost.    The location is great ... easy for touring the Medina. The food in the Moroccan restaurant was delicious and very good quality. The breakfast was really good with fresh omelets crepes and various fresh juices.

The decor and lighting around the hotel were very tastefully done and we were always happy to hang around leisurely by the pool area after breakfast and also in the courtyard for afternoon mint tea.    We fell in love with Marrakech on this trip and its people. Much of this was influenced by the attentive service and genuine friendliness and warmth of the staff at La Maison Arabe. They took exceptional care of us and we enjoyed chatting with them and being welcomed by their smiling faces throughout the hotel. My husband loves labneh and even though this is not a traditional dish in Morocco after asking for it our first breakfast they went on to make it for him specially every morning for the rest of our stay!

La Maison Arabe,benstopford wrote a review Nov 2016,50,Pleasant mix of Riad and Hotel,We've stayed in a few places in Marrakech. We'd dined here before and enjoyed it so on returning stayed for just one night. It's a lovely place that balances the warmth or a Riad with the facilities of a hotel.    The service is top notch. This is common in most Marrakech higher end riads but Aribe is no different. The rooms are very cute finished to a very high standard and comfortable. The location is good. We also stayed in Riad Kinza which is quite close but and found Aribe worth the extra cost.    The restaurant has the most wonderful ambiance. Truly stunning. Oddly the food we've eaten here was nothing special. We tend to stick with the Moroccan dishes. Maybe we'll try the European ones next time.

Since all the food is halal- as in we could even eat sausages! It was heavenly and they make you feel like king and Queens at breakfast.    The fresh roses in the room smell heavenly. I have never smelt roses like that in the US.    They also have a gift shop where they sell organic Aragan oil. They will give a set price and it's better to buy from there instead of the street markets as they might not be selling you the real stuff.    P.S.

For our stay: from the moment we walked in the front door through the team finding us a ride to the airport we were taken care of as though we were VIP guests.    The welcome drink was delicious and refreshing - it was the perfect way for us to settle in. We then went on a very thorough tour of of the property - there are so many wonderful nooks and crannies and things to take advantage of at the property.    Our room was beautiful - it had a patio that overlooked the pool and was very spacious. The room was filled with beautiful flowers and the amenities were wonderful. We took advantage of the spa and both had massages - the spa facilities were luxurious and calming.    We had a great dinner in the international restaurant. Service was good and the food was delicious.    We ordered room service for breakfast and it was one of the best breakfast meals we had on our entire trip.

La Maison Arabe,Junebughiker wrote a review Nov 2016,50,Charming hotel with great service and lovely rooms,I really enjoyed my three day stay in La Maison Arabe. The hotel is a charming old hotel in the medina. My suite was spacious and very comfortable and the service was wonderful. The hotel is a bit like a jigsaw puzzle to find your way around (I kept taking wrong turns and stairs to get to my room and other parts of the hotel but always found everything!). It has two terrific restaurants once with Moroccan cuisine and the other with French & Thai cuisine. My meals at both were great. The spa was a great surprise. On my first days there I had a harmman with the classic steam bath and scrub and then a massage. It was so relaxing and the spa is beautiful and peaceful with interesting moroccan design. It is underground so you feel like you are in a special cave of relaxation after a crazy day exploring the medina. My last day there I took a moroccan cooking class in the hotel's demonstration kitchen. It was so much fun to make our chicken tagine and salads and then eat them together as a group of three families from England Sweden and the USA. The chef and cooking team were terrific and we learned a lot about the spices and other ingredients used in Moroccan cooking. I had debated staying in one of the more recently developed resorts in Marrakesh but I am so glad I chose La Maison Arabe.

Often times rooms assigned to solo travelers do not receive the same attention to detail or luxury that larger rooms do. This is definitely not the case at La Maison Arabe. Loved the leather wrapped armoire with generous interior storage; the painted ceilings that defined the bed area; the atmospheric operable arched windows that lined one entire side of the room and the generous patio furnished with an alcoved banquette lined with pillows. Of course the bed and linens were superior the bathroom marbled and spotless.    Imagine recessed lights set into recessed stars! This is the attention to detail that adds a special touch. Then imagine that ALL of the public spaces are wrapped in this kind of magical detail. This is an experience to savor as you move from one intimate lounge area to another and to the different dining venues. Not surprisingly the service in both the restaurants and riad matches the high expectations set by the ambience and decor.

La Maison Arabe,aclarke12016 wrote a review Oct 2016,50,Excellent service and experience,We stayed for three nights in La Maison Arabe for a wedding anniversary. The whole experience of the hotel was very good. It is located in a small side street but close to all the main sites of the old city so we were able to walk everywhere. But once inside the doors from the busy city the hotel is an oasis of peace and tranquility. It is a beautifully individual hotel around two courtyards with rooms reached by a whole variety of corridors and staircases - far removed from the identical corridors and rooms of most modern hotels. The public rooms were all beautifully decorated and there lots of nooks and crannies with sofas and chairs. Our room a Junior Suite was perfect - large and very comfortable and again very tastefully decorated in Moroccan style. We had a sitting room and a patio balcony overlooking a courtyard as well as large bedroom. When we arrived we were offered a welcome drink there was wine and water in our room and rose petals scattered around! Breakfast in the restaurant set round the pool was idyllic and in the evening with all the candles and lights it looked stunning. We had a Hammam one afternoon in the basement spa which was a lovely experience in a very restful setting. We also visited the hotel's country club where we enjoyed the pool and lunch. Apart from a group of women who came to use the pool for short period after a cookery class there were just six of us. There were one or two issues which were not quite as excellent. The water in the bathroom was not always as hot as it might have been so the large walk in shower could not be as powerful as it might have been. And the food was good and tasty - we ate breakfast and dinner one evening - but it was not quite as good as the rest of the hotel. One of the most impressive aspects of the hotel was the service. For a small hotel there seemed a very good staff / guess ratio and all the staff were attentive and helpful smiling and friendly with out being overbearing in any way. There were white gloved waiters who would joke with you. The hotel reception had also filled out our departure cards for the airport ready for us when we checked out. We spent our last day at the country club and returned to the hotel shuttle minibus to collect our bags and wait for the taxi. The hotel manager offered us a bedroom to use for an hour to shower and rest before the flight which was a very thoughtful touch and seemed to sum up the hotel's approach. We looked at a lot of Marrakech hotel websites before choosing La Maison Arabe and we were really pleased with our choice. We would recommend it wholeheartedly.,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Oxfordshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aclarke12016

La Maison Arabe,WBa1 wrote a review Oct 2016,50,Excellent,Pickup at the Airport was as expected. Nice clean car and polite driver.  Reception simply perfect. All Papers filled out ready to sign.  We also got a nice welcome drink and information about the hotel.  After a short time personal knew your room and handed out the correct key.  Papers to leave the country again where also handed out at the checkout.    Hotel / Rooms are first of all nice and clean and very authentic arab stile.  Simply romantic.    The same thing goes for the restaurant. Brilliant atmosphere.  The food with many arab dishes excellent cook and not to much adapted to world taste.  But also standards as tenderloin and similar are on the card.  The Service also excellent kind and efficient.    The Location in the middle of Marrakech is excellent. You can reach every point of the old city easily by foot. No car needed.  To find the way back is another story     We travel quite a bit. We also been in hotel double the price of “le maison arab”.  Here we got the best price ratio of them all.    We can highly recommend this place to every class of traveller.

La Maison Arabe,June108 wrote a review Oct 2016,50,Exceptional service,We have travelled the world and work in the hotel business and have to say this is one of the best hotel experiences we have had. The suite was large and very comfortable. The Riad was beautiful and full of Moroccan art prices. Every nook and courtyard had beautiful sitting areas. The real standout was the service. The management and staff seemed to anticipate our needs before us asking and were constantly providing additional service items at no charge and doing whatever they could to ensure we were comfortable and happy. In a world where everything comes at a price we were pleasantly surprised and extremely appreciative of he service here. Thank you so much for making our stay perfect.

La Maison Arabe,EdoSal wrote a review Oct 2016,50,Excellent choice,The service was excellent. The staff was well trained they answered whatever you asked or they find out for you. Everybody was smiling from the front desk to the restaurant waitress service is amazing. The building was a Riad and then they built a new hotel integrated by different levels and stairs. Every corner has been decorated with fine Morocco style pieces. The numbers of the suites are embroidered on the door as well as the bed sheets tablecloth and the like.    The suite was simply extraordinary. You have a big bathroom one space for the King Size bed and a living room plus a terrace looking to the interior patio with the swimming pool and restaurant. Everything was fully equipped with the best furniture and equipment.    The breakfast included was a buffet with all kinds of fresh fruits natural juices different types of bread eggs. Everything was top class and service was simply the best.    The restaurant by the swimming pool is superb. At dinner I tried the lamb it was delicious. They also have good red wine a local Syrah I never knew they have red wine it was good. The tables are surrounded by old olive trees by the swimming pool.    Location of the hotel is optimal. It about 15 minutes walking to the main market Jaana al Fne so you can simply walk by to know a little bit more of the culture. Although it looks like poor and sometimes scaring we never had any incident.    The taxi drivers will try to charge you as much as they can but as everything in Marrakech you should bargain the price tell ask them how it is to take to one place and offer them between 50% and 60% they will say yes at the end.    People mostly speak French and English as their second language and some Spanish.,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Santiago, Chile",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdoSal

Prices for rooms are much to high...200-800 € range.......superior?.......""yes but there is a private jacuzi"".....what?.....for that price you can buy one at home..... Luxury PALACES in Marrakesh do NOT ask such prices for a private.. VILLA!....Low season in ""la maison arabe"" is only ONE ! month...!???......Dinner was not bad ....in the dark. Not a place to relax though with swimming pool downstairs between people having lunch or dining.  So each time you are in the sun and wants a swimm....you have to come downstairs ?...... ""Yes.....but we have a property....that you can reach with a shuttle outside Marrakesh......with a big pool""......?...... Maroccon waiters with handgloves.??... artificial... ...you can feal that they are not at ease........nothing to do with the real maroccon people who are friendly and hospitable by nature........ Just makes me think at the South of France.......bling bling.......beautifull people. .......seen and being seen....... Was NOT impressed. In the dark I heared guitars play....and was so glad to be able to leave. Very business like ""give me your creditcard attitude"". People who think this is the real Marrakesh......think again !!! Would be my worst nightmare to have a holiday at this place with all the bling bling. It is just a would be boutique chique like overrated ordinary hotel dixit big riad. Not my cup of tea. Would not like to pay the bill after a 14days stay...or after a Christmas or New years stay.......Marrakesh has so much more and better to offer.

La Maison Arabe,azjayhawks wrote a review Oct 2016,50,It's all the little things!,We wrapped up a month-long trip through Morocco with four nights in La Maison Arabe which just may be the best hotel we have ever experienced. The service alone is unsurpassed. Examples include the invisible silent housekeeping ; the waitstaff which seemingly by osmosis knew to bring an extra cushion for back support; the attentiveness of Christophe the restaurant manager ; Adil and company at the front desk whose assistance every day was offered with genuine pleasure; and the unexpected upgrade at check-in. Then there's the excellent location the restaurants the architecture and décor the small intimate and private feel of the place and the fact that the dress is low-key casual and comfortable. We stayed in Room 7  a suite which although it had no balcony had a wonderful sitting room with lots of light a fireplace (unused but beautiful) framed illustrated manuscripts on the walls and in the bedroom the most comfortable bed in Morocco set into a romantic alcove and the room punctuated by fine detailed woodwork. Great high-speed WIFI and complimentary copies of the International New York Times tops it off .

He arranged for a great guide through the medina at a reasonable price got us our train tickets to fes booked reservations for dinner at great restaurants and even swapped certain spa treatments that came with our hotel package when one of our group said she didnt like the one that was included.    The building feels like you walk into an awesome time warp--tons of cute sitting areas a jazz/piano bar (complete with quirky engaging bartender Rachid) and elegant restaurant (it has a very nice breakfast spread with even better lunches and dinners). Our room (220) had its own little outdoor sitting space king bed lots of room and big bathroom. Also their country club it great. It has a cooking school with lovely gardens a pool cabanas nice changing/bathroom facilities and cafe. The spa was beautiful as well. It was peaceful with many moroccan lanterns providing soft light. I recommend the traditional hammam scrub and massage.    Conveniently located in the medina so that you can walk to old town with ease.

In hotel there is a nespresso but we asked for a kettle and we did get it and also we asked for a iron with iron board in our room. as i said earlier staff are very helpful. if you are a tea lover like my sister and me than carry your own tea bags as their tea is not as strong as our breakfast tea. we book a cooking class which we thoroughly enjoyed. must say their kitchen are very well equipped for the cooking classes. their spa services were top notch. must try hamam with massage was really a treat. we went to their country club and its really a treat too. we spent an afternoon but you can spend a whole day there. its really beautiful place with a pool and a restaurant.

It is a beautiful property with 2 restaurants a bar/lounge a spa/hammam and a pool (though you can't really go swimming in it -- it's more like a lap pool and all the people eating are surrounding the pool so it would be a bit odd). The staff was incredibly helpful and knowledgeable -- they would hail us taxis and negotiate with the drivers for us. One night we were lost getting to a restaurant and they came and walked us there -- that is above and beyond service! The food at the restaurants was excellent. We had dinner there 3 times and breakfast every day. A huge thank you to La Maison Arabe for making a special trip even more so.

This tucked away Oasis has gorgeous interiors and is incredibly well looked after. We were upgraded after our first night and both rooms were very well kept; clean and tidy with plenty of space.    -Reception  Welcomed by warm happy faces every time we visited the reception. They were very eager to help with any area related questions and local knowledge. They organised countless drivers and recommended many places to visit during the day.    -Restaurant  A gastronomic delight every evening. A large array of meals on offer both a Moroccan menu and an international menu providing ample choice for the fussiest of diners. Restaurant staff were exceptional giving a constant friendly vibe without hassling and often checked if everything was ok. There was a genuine feel that the employees enjoyed their job and were striving for the best possible service they could deliver. The setting of the restaurant was stunning with live musicians every evening playing gentle moroccan music creating a great atmosphere.    - Bar  Radjit what a wonderful bartender. Continuously helpful providing his daily cocktail of choice which was always nice in the hot weather and all done with no hassle and a smile on his face. A beautiful jazz bar situated towards the rear of the hotel with great ambience.    -Spa  A perfect addition to the hotel especially after a day in the Souks. With a selection of different oils and treatments to choose from we were led into a beautiful interior where we enjoyed a relaxing massage each as well as a steam bath. Both times we were met by wonderful staff who both greeted and treated us very well.    -Cooking class  A must do if visiting Marrakech and only around the corner. The tutor and 'Dada' taught us a great deal about the cuisine. We learned how to make a couple of salads two tagines and a dessert. We were even given a diploma and a free tagine dish at the end! A brilliant way to learn more of the culture.    -General Staff  From personal experience we have not been to a hotel with such a high calibre of staff before (and we have stayed at some pretty nice ones).The closest we have experienced is that of the Ritz London.Their extraordinary politeness overall willingness to help and always happy to go the extra mile was definitely noticed. We loved seeing their smiley faces every day and this makes us even more keen to come and visit again soon.,Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/14056724
La Maison Arabe,628gregk wrote a review Aug 2016,50,"Spectacular hotel, restaurant, cooking school, and spa",La Maison Arabe was a wonderful experience from the moment we arrived in Marrakech. This was a first visit to Morrocco and the staff took care of us--from arranging guides and drivers to suggesting and confirming restaurant reservations. I highly recommend the cooking school which is the best one in the world that I have attended. The spa is also world class. All of this is located in a hotel that feels small enough to be intimate. It is right in the medina and close to everything. I would definitely stay here again on our next trip.,Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/628gregk

La Maison Arabe,SparkyD1972 wrote a review Aug 2016,50,Outstanding!,Having had such a great experience at La Maison Arabe last October my wife son and I decided to visit again in August 2016. Based on our previous stay we arrived with great expectations and we weren't disappointed from the first moment we stepped back inside LMA being greeted like old friends/family to our departure. A free room upgrade was an unexpected bonus but as with our first visit it was the attention to detail and consistently outstanding customer service that makes LMA stand out from all other hotels we have stayed in. Never have we felt so at home in somewhere other than our own home. We are planning a third visit for next year and can't wait to again be back 'home' sipping Moroccan tea and sampling the top quality food (whether for breakfast or dinner) and enjoying the tranquillity of LMA's 'Country Club'......an absolute God-send in the busy city. All of the team at LMA deserve massive credit for the professionalism and warmth they bring to their roles. Anyone looking to sample an authentic and in all aspects first class stay in Marrakech need look no further than La Maison Arabe.,Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SparkyD1972

In all my trips this raid far exceeded the others. We stayed here for five nights and experienced a high standard of hospitality. The staff were friendly and helpful to our needs including missing our flights on the return to London!    We enjoyed a beautiful junior sweet that overlooked a beautiful pool garden. Each nook of this hotel had a special original feature of beautiful Marrakesh. I most enjoyed our evenings at the La Maison Arabe; they had an authentic Moroccan musician play live with string instruments amount candle light with exquisite food!

Excellent service - the staff are really welcoming and caring. Rooms are interesting - although ours was somewhat on the small side and the bathroom was in need of a refresh. Food is simply delicious. Closely located to the Medina. The highlights are the antiques all over the place breakfast / dinner by the pool area and afternoon moroccan tea by the fountain...

La Maison Arabe,Hannah G wrote a review Aug 2016,50,Paradise,As you will see from nearly every single other review this hotel is faultless. It is a paradise from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech. I can't think of a single complaint from my stay here.    We travelled here last summer on a whim ahead of a longer trip to Italy (strangely the flights between Marrakech and Pisa are incredibly cheap!) and it did not disappoint.    The hotel arranged for transit from the airport and we were met by the most charming and friendly staff. We arrived to mint tea and Moroccan cakes and were then shown to our room. The air conditioning worked a treat in the height of summer and our room was beautifully decorated and very spacious.    We ate lunch in the main hotel once and dinner there twice because the food was so very good. Our table in the evening was situated by the edge of the stunningly lit pool and I enjoyed a chicken and almond pastille to start followed by a lamb tagine for my main course. The wine was really excellent and I discovered Moroccan beer is also rather nice! There were live musicians playing the lute while we ate dinner and a pianist in the hotel bar during drinks afterwards.    The hotel staff will go out of their way to help you - booking taxis tours and excursions. Nothing is too much trouble for them. There are hourly shuttles to the country club which is also another paradise. We had lunch here three times and swam during the hottest part of the day before returning to Marrakech to explore in the late afternoon sun.    The bar in the hotel is wonderful and the bartender will mix you any cocktail you feel like. The hotel really does feel like a step back in time to the luxury of the 1930's/40's.    The treatments available in the hotel spa are also fantastic. I had a massage on one day and a traditional hammam scrub towards the end of my stay which made my skin feel wonderful for weeks afterwards.    This hotel is excellent value for money the food is of the highest standard (French/Moroccan cuisine) the two swimming pools are beautiful the rooms are kept to an incredibly high standard and what really made this the experience that is was were the amazing hotel staff who were the friendliest most professional I have ever encountered. I have recommended this hotel to every single person who can bear to hear me rave about it endlessly and my dad has just booked a visit. If you are visiting Marrakech or thinking of going then book this hotel. You won't regret it.,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/651hannahg

La Maison Arabe,shaddorff wrote a review Aug 2016,50,"Unbelievably Serene, Truly Unforgettable",Staying at Maison Arabe was a pure delight from the moment we arrived. The riad’s tasteful decor was masterfully curated by its current owner a royal descendent himself. It feels like a palace where you can expect comfortable beds consistent AC in your room and incredibly helpful staff.    The concierge coordinated a shuttle from the airport for us. Perfect for ease of travel but even if you arrive by taxi the riad is easy to find down a short walkway with a well-labeled front door. We appreciated the concierges’ expert guidance throughout our whole trip. They helped us on everything from restaurants to haggling taxi fares and efficient routes through the old city.    It was the middle of July (the slow season in Morocco) we were welcomed with an icy Marrahito a signature juice created by beverage connoisseur Rashid. The drink was so refreshing it marked the official kickoff of our 7-day vacation in Marrakech.    Rashid was one of the many staff members we had the pleasure of knowing during our stay. He seemed always up for warm conversation and manages the Jazz Bar which has live music most nights. The restaurant also has live guitar and lute music that provide lovely accompaniment to the lantern-lit atmosphere and world-class cuisine.    Maison Arabe’s menu is packed with memorable dishes. Our favorites were the Chicken Bastille Chicken Tagine Moroccan Salads and Vegetable Cous Cous. We couldn’t have been more pleased and the quality was a fine reminder of the riad’s rich history rooted in French Cuisine. We were also impressed by the variety of gourmet foods included in the breakfast buffet.    If you can take the chance to visit the Hammam for a treatment please do. Its dreamy alluring peaceful and dark atmosphere are truly not to be missed and the massages my husband and I received were skillful therapeutic and among the best we've had.    One can easily enjoy a full day of activities without leaving the hotel. The riad’s “Country Club” sets Maison Arabe apart is well worth visiting and included as part of your stay. Hop on the short (and free) 15-minute shuttle and find yourself relaxing by a pool surrounded by spacious lounge areas gardens fruit trees and a cantina ready to attend your every need. The Nicoise salad was large enough for two with a mountain of fresh vegetables and divine flavors that mixed well together. Its an unbelievably serene oasis.    Miason Arabe's thoughtful staff puts all the best into every last detail. Your stay there will be comfortable. For the price of a typical hotel in any US city you’ll get all the best of Morocco’s offerings from one place. I hope my review doesn't spoil the surprise for future guests. We hope everyone takes the chance to enjoy the comfort of Maison Arabe.

La Maison Arabe,Buddhist wrote a review Jul 2016,50,"Elegance, Beauty, Hospitality and Impeccable Service!",We visited Marrakech in Morocco during the third week of June 2016 and words cannot describe or justify our experience during our stay at this gorgeous gem of a hotel. But I promise to do justice by covering every aspect of the hotel and its operations.  The location is pretty central in the “Old City/Medina” Section of Marrakech and is quite surprisingly hidden away from the main streets! In fact when you first arrive from the outside (street view) one cannot imagine what he/she will find inside this beautiful hotel. From the time we arrived and warmly greeted by our bell hop-who literarily ran towards our car so we didn't have to wait (wow now that’s service!!) to the time we were seated and served mint tea in one of their reception areas prior to check in--and that too at the famous table where Winston Churchill supposedly dined-when that specific area used to be a restaurant it was truly an awe-inspiring experience. We almost felt like a part of history. The assistant front office manager Mourad was amazing. He went over our reservations for the whole week including our excursions and various dining itineraries for every single day. My wife had booked a couple of activities already through him and it was so seamless to go over the itinerary with him without being rushed. And we did all of this while tasting their delicious custom made cookies. Mourad was simply fantastic. We truly appreciated all his assistance prior to us arriving (my wife and him were communicating and setting/tweaking itinerary over emails) and his assistance prior to our arrival and during our stay was priceless. Thank you Mourad! Please know you were appreciated.  The rooms here are gorgeous each has its own identity and unique personality we stayed at one of their junior suites and it was truly like staying at a family's home. The beds were very comfortable the towels sheets the amenities were all of top notch quality. Truly a Luxury Hotel by all means. The guest rooms are attended to twice a day the PM Service is done but with the utmost care-not a typical turn down service. And here is where the La Maison distinguishes itself from other high end hotels…All through our stay not once were we disturbed by Housekeeping in an attempt to clean our room. The hotel staff is so thoughtful that they actually are aware of our presence in the room and only enter when we are not present in the room. Wow…so they probably have an attendant on standby for any hour to provide a personalized and prompt service to their guests’ room! There was an added personal touch to every aspect of service rendered to the room...thank you housekeeping staff! Your pride and joy in your work truly exemplified in the way our room was cleaned and maintained. Thank you! God Bless you!  Now for the bar and restaurant...The bar attendants the servers and the overall staff here are just fabulous. The attention to detail the quality of décor the ambience the service AND the FOOD---all were just heavenly....Like I said at the beginning of this review words cannot describe the experience at this beautiful beautiful beautiful hotel. The bar has a live entertainment during specific hours in the evening. It’s a very serene environment with a very talented soloist who sings plays piano as well as plays a guitar! Every guest area of this hotel is so inviting and entertaining that one almost wants to be so thankful for everything one experiences.  We had our daily breakfast by the poolside and it was always a pleasure to be greeted by the hosts and servers. The dining room manager also made it a point to visit our table acknowledge us greet us with warmth and ensure everything was to our satisfaction. We would see him during dinner(s) and in the mornings during breakfast. Amazing even by working back to back (a hotel lingo for those working pm shift and then the very next morning shift.) For breakfast there was abundance of fresh fruits exotic fruit juices cookies various cold cuts and hot food especially their potato dishes are very tasty-- something for everyone. And if you have a special need or request they will take care of it promptly. They even had a specific person make vegetable pancakes I forget the local name for it but good Lord is it tasty or what?! I had a couple every day!! The lady who made these pancakes made it right by the pool side in full sight of everyone. It’s a must try!  As if their regular services weren’t enough the hotel also provides daily evening tea at their courtyard (Riyad). You have to sit back relax and try this experience. You will also meet some lovely people from around the world who partake in the same experience. We met some wonderful couples from Britain Portugal etc. These kind of experiences cannot be related to by simply reading in a review unless you experience it yourself. So here is my hint…make that trip! Life is short make it as sweet as possible. This is my quote and I tend to live by it. (So help me God!)   For dinner I will definitely recommend dining at their fine dining restaurant. They have a live music performance by Khalid brothers (I believe they are brothers) Badaoui and Isbah. A guitar and vocal rendition of some soulful songs that truly touch your heart despite the fact that we did not understand the language it was simply exquisite to listen to! The Beauty of Music is that if played well it is truly an International Language! No doubt! So here you have it friends....great food beautiful music lovely environment spending quality time with family and a splash of sincere and warm hospitality what else can one ask for?! Oh yes I know....a great bottle of local Moroccan wine will be an icing to the cake. We had our share of wine and it was brilliant!  Also for those teetotalers seek out their various teas and coffee it is just out of this world.  And yes try their services at the spa...you will be amazed at the services offered. It’s an extensive menu of services so my humble suggestion is to try at least two and I promise you won’t regret it. My wife and I and even our nine year old daughter took the massage sessions and were in our own world of nirvana! The staff here is exceptional. They work behind the scenes and need to be acknowledged for their service. Well done spa staff many thanks!  While staying at the La Maison you must try their recommended tours…one of their site tours is a lovely visit to “The Gardens” (Famous designer and entrepreneur Yves St Laurent (YSL) memorial is at this location as well.) Then there is this “cooking Class” that is conducted off site courtesy of LaMaison Arabe…You have to attend this one…it is quite an experience! You learn so much about the delicious Moroccan cuisine. And you come away learning a dish or two! We then all get to taste our own cooking! Though a scary thought…But it was actually pretty good! :)  And of course no trip to Morocco is complete without a visit to the Atlas Mountains --The highest peak in North Africa. The guide who at the behest of my wife was arranged by the hotel (and is an additional expense as it is a third party contract) was excellent and thorough. He took us to all the places we wanted to go and we were thrilled to get a wonderful guide who literally treated us like family! Kudos to La Maison Arabe for raising their standards so high that even their contracted business partners display exceptional service. All in all this was a Blessing of an experience and we were very grateful for the hospitality extended by the hotel management and staff alike. A big round of applause for you. Please keep up the great work. Well done!!  Sadly the day of departure arrived and we were so graciously and lovingly bid adieu by their staff specifically their Front Office Manager Adil Chaif. He is truly “hospitality personified.” A gracious man with a warm kind and generous Heart. A total gentleman. God Bless him. It was such a pleasure to have made our acquaintance with such gracious people at the hotel that it would be a no brainer for us to return here when God willing we have another opportunity to visit Morocco.

La Maison Arabe,sebastian P wrote a review Jul 2016,40,Expected much more from the 'first Ryad in Marrakech...',The property is beautiful and the location is outstanding.    However is it worth the price?    There are far too many options priced at the same level. in Marrakech to settle for this one.    Yes it is historic. But you may as well try some of the other Riads or hotels nearby. The rooms are a little run down as is the custom in Marrakech.    The breakfast was very good. The service was attentive when they could.    Is it five stars? mmm maybe not. While there are Nespresso machines in the room the hotel charges you 30/40 dirhams per capsule. Can you believe that? I know it is a small detail but it just should not happen. How can you be five stars and charge for the nespresso capsules? Are you really making money like that? What is the freaking point?

La Maison Arabe,James C wrote a review Jul 2016,50,A luxurious experience with incredible staff inside the Marrakesh Medina,La Maison Arabe is an incredible hotel. The location inside the Medina provides a convenient opportunity to experience old Marrakesh on foot at any time. This is a real experience for the adventurous but not for the faint of heart. For everyone else the hotel itself has many opportunities to relax or take excursions outside the Medina including to their athletic club outside the walls via a convenient shuttle.    The ambiance in the hotel is everything you could imagine in a Moroccan Riad but what what truly sets it apart is the staff. From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty with an upgraded room and an overwhelming willingness to do whatever they could to help us plan our vacation. They completely organized trips for us to the Ourika Valley in the High Atlas mountains and the Essaouira by the sea. They arranged dinner reservations and even transportation to Casablanca on our departure.    The restaurant inside the hotel was fabulous and breakfast each morning was delicious. WiFi in the room was a bit erratic at times and could be improved but still was easy enough to access inside the hotel.

La Maison Arabe,ladyferrara wrote a review Jul 2016,50,A great winter break - with sunshine and MORE,My sisters and I decided to celebrate out youngest sister's birthday somewhere farflung but not too far from London/Dublin. The destination was an easy decision to make but we were looking for somewhere low-key but stylish not far from the local hotspots. Jmma el Fnaa the Blue house (YSL place a short walk away). Coming back to this oasis was always a pleasure. They looked after all of our needs (even those we hadn't realised we had when we first arrived e.g. they sorted out our travelling papers for our return as soon as we arrived without any fuss) a welcome drink (delicious morito) and a tour. The rooms are amazing. Well our rooms were. Comfortable in a very delightful Riad arrangement - stairs where you least expect them. Split level rooms. The breakfast is a little arrangement around the charming pool - try everything! The juices are delicious little morsels of heaven. And the staff were the best. Helpful friendly in the most inobtrusive way. Do take a dip in the pool once the breakfast crowd leaves. You can sun on the terraces with endless mint tea.    Food in the restaurants was amazing but do venture out. Its worth it and its not really anything to worry about. We were three women and we were fine and did not feel at all worried.    PS you can in 20 mins be driven to Palmaeriae where there is a wonderful sister hotel with an great (but cold in December) pool where you can sunbathe like an Italianate! Its called Via Ruspoli.

La Maison Arabe,meheartsthevacays wrote a review Jul 2016,50,"When you think you've gone too far in the wrong direction, you've probably found it.","This review is for the restaurant only. We did not stay at this riad. (For our hotel review please see my separate review of the Four Seasons.)    My advice to you? Take a taxi here. We walked here from the souks and had to ask for directions four times. Mind you we are well traveled and have found our way across numerous continents with no issues. So armed with a map off we went to find this restaurant. Oh wait none of the street signs list the English translation of the street names. After almost giving up we finally found it and let me tell you it was worth the effort.    The restaurant is housed in a riad which is a traditional Moroccan house. This place is also a hotel but this review is just for the restaurant. We arrived a bit late so it was not extremely crowded -- perhaps six tables were occupied. There was a trio performing traditional Moroccan music which was the right tempo and volume. It created a good ambiance but not too obtrusive. The food was excellent. We ordered a chicken and a fish tagine along with a trio of pastillas to start. The server asked if we were okay with shrimp in the fish tagine and we said no. He came back later to let us know there was a bit of shrimp in the seafood pastilla we had ordered and gave us the option of switching it out for a different flavor. Fabulous service! I also was obsessed with the amuse bouche they served (a Lebanese pepper purée) so the server was kind enough to write down the name for me along with the recipe.    This was our first evening in Morocco and we used it as the guideline for the rest of our meals. ""Should we find another place like La Maison Arabe?"" We kept asking each other.

During our half day course we learnt to bake bread make tea prepare a chicken tajine and two traditional salads and had more traditional desserts. We even got a present at the end!    The only downside was the heat whilst cooking. It was a very hot day (41℃) and it would have been better if overhead fans were available. Plenty of cold water was however provided which made things more manageable.    We would highly recommend a cooking course at La Maison Arabe. It is very good value for money and an unforgettable experience!,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Keynsham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/375alikiz
La Maison Arabe,Richard M wrote a review Jun 2016,50,Perfection personfied!,La Maison Arabe is perfectly situated in the Medina just a ten minute walk from the main square with the famous minaret looming over it.  The 26-roomed hostelry is delightfully configured with breakfast each day by a delightful lap pool and an alternative much larger pool at the hotel's country club just 15 minutes drive away by a free shuttle bus where relaxation is the order of the day.  Fabrizio and Jose who own the hotel couldn't be more delightful hosts with a staff that is as helpful and solicitous as can be.  In the past I have enjoyed staying at the Mamouniawhich is quite nearby but the recent makeover is a case of marble overload making it more like a mausoleum than a hotel although the buffet lunch by the pool is still an enjoyable repast.

La Maison Arabe,MeggyFin wrote a review Jun 2016,50,Two awesome resorts for the price of one,We had only one night in Marrakech and our first pic (the hotel we stayed at the one of time) was full. All of a sudden we found ourselves with no idea where to stay. So I blindly picked La Maison Arabe based on the fact that it started out as a restaurant and we are big foodies. I will say we struck gold. This place is impeccably decorated excitingly maze like the spa (that we didn't get a chance to use) looked AMAZING and our room was big and super-romance-inducing (if you catch my drift). The best part is that their pool is in a separate location so you get to drive through the city (via their shuttle) see the sites then wind up in a lush fancy pool resort (that also has a cooking school and gorgeous gardens!). It felt like we had stayed at two different resorts in one day.    If you don't know where to stay feeling overwhelmed with choices then take a deep breath and book La Maison Arabe.,Date of stay: June 2016,,"Los Angeles, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeggyFin
La Maison Arabe,NCH99 wrote a review Jun 2016,50,A home from home welcome with a wonderful atmosphere,Although our first visit to La Maison Arabe we were treated like 'old friends' from the moment we arrived. The staff immediately made us feel welcome and the service of all staff was second to none. We spent many an hour in the Jazz Bar with Rashid's No 1 and 2. Rashid the head barman spent so much time teaching us about the local culture and traditions and was always on hand with some new cocktail or local delicacy to try. We were upgraded to a deluxe room and it had everything we could wish for. We spent a couple of days at the Country Club where the staff were also friendly and attentive lovely to sit by the pool in beautiful gardens to while away some hours. Attending the cookery school is a must we had such fun and Wafa and her team were so informative and friendly. Breakfast and dinner around the pool was relaxing and tasty with plenty of choice - again the staff cannot do enough so you want something adjusted just ask. We instantly relaxed and cannot wait to return. The location is great just a short walk to the Souks and the square but far enough away to be a peaceful retreat from the hustle and bustle.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Reading, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NCH99

La Maison Arabe,RRO wrote a review Jun 2016,40,"Beautiful location and rooms, average food",The hotel is lovely and the staff extra pleasant. Our room/suite was large and nicely furnished. Since the Riad is made up of several buildings getting from one area to the other was a series of up and down staircases with many twists and turns--a trail of breadcrumbs might have been in order.    There are lots of places to sit and read a book or just sip a drink--all very pretty. Unfortunately the area outside the hotel was a extreme a contrast from the inside and could be very intimidating for unseasoned travelers.    There is also a mosque nearby so if you are a light sleeper you are likely to be awaken for the very early morning and late evening calls to prayer.    We spent three days at the Maison Arabe so we were able to sample breakfasts lunches and dinners. The food was all right but not at the level I would expect for the prices. Dinner portions were also surprisingly small for the price.    The pool area is lovely and I love the birds who dart in and out looking for tiny scraps of food. The service is very attentive--perhaps a little too much for me but generally cordial.    Unfortunately the menu did not change during our stay so the choices were limited for our palates but many might find the selection sufficient.    The hotel and restaurant were a pleasant plant filled refuge for the unrelenting chaos and traffic outside its walls.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Orange, CT",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebeccaRyanOrange

My wish is that everyone on every budget could spend at least one night here. The staff has the attitude of a riad or B&B in terms of addressing needs and I found them to be genuinely and humanly caring and kind – not just providing a service. They are attentive to details that even I didn’t know I needed.  The exquisite details throughout the facility were so artful – from the lighting choices to the magnificently carved paneling. Then there is the jazz bar and its winsome barman Rajid telling stories and delivering history with a flair and I could go on and on. The hotel is a perfect balance of European and Moroccan sensibilities – expressing the diverse history of the country. I didn’t have time to go to the wellness spa but it was so well attenuated that I am considering going back just for that experience!

La Maison Arabe,Jan H wrote a review May 2016,50,An Oasis in Marrakech,"My family of three stayed at La Maison Arabe during a recent four day weekend trip to Marrakech. We love this hotel and cannot wait to return!  Reception arranged a car to pick us up at the airport and bring us to the hotel. I was glad to have the driver walk us to the hotel but found it easy to find in the maze of Marrakech. And it is an excellent location to explore the city. Upon arrival we were taken to the courtyard offered their signature drink checked in and given a tour of the beautiful property. I instantly fell in love with the décor especially the light fixtures and carpets. Everything is beautiful and no detail has been overlooked.  We were hungry so a table was found for us immediately at the restaurant by the pool. The food was delicious and we enjoyed a combination of Moroccan and international dishes. My teenage daughter is a picky eater but every request or question was met with a ""yes we can"" attitude. The staff was friendly and professional.  Our room was large and overlooked the pool. Our beds were comfortable the temperature was perfect and we appreciated the complementary water and wine in the room. We all enjoyed sitting on the balcony in the mornings and evenings.  Breakfast by the pool is beautifully presented. We all enjoyed made to order omelets and the Moroccan pancakes were delicious. The rest of the buffet contained everything and anything you could want. Fresh fruits Moroccan pastries and an assortment of juices were all appreciated.  We had to cancel our first spa appointment because our tour ran long. I'm glad we were able to reschedule for the next evening. The 45 minute relaxing massage was just what me and my husband needed after trekking the Atlas Mountains. My daughter's toes have never looked better after her pedicure. Such a relaxing experience that we all enjoyed.  My review would not be complete without mentioning Rashid in the Jazz Bar! He created the house drink and it is dynamite!! His personality matches the drink - and he is one of the reasons we kept enjoying the Jazz Bar. Outstanding service and always welcomed us with a smile and drink!!  We did not experience the cooking school or pool at the other property this trip.

There I found peace comfort tranquility and privacy. As beautifully luxurious as this hotel is the best part of it is the generous helpful kindhearted staff. Need a taxi? Not only will they get you one but they will negotiate the correct price for you saving you at least double. Get lost in the Medina? They will send someone to find you.  The spa is wonderfully serene. I had a divine massage with rose petal scented oil there.  The hotel's breakfast buffet is also as good as it gets with such treats as fresh smoked salmon Berber pancakes savory cornmeal torte honey drenched figs fresh juices and yogurt made on premises.  Afternoon tea is also included and comes with the hotels signature nonalcoholic Mohito mint tea or English tea plus delectable pastries.  We liked the food there so much that we ate there every night. Our favorite table was poolside where we could best enjoy the classical guitar and lute music offered in the evening.  We also greatly enjoyed the lovely swimming pool and appreciated the hotel's sensitivity toward the modesty of its Muslim guests and staff in putting the sunbathing lounge discreetly overlooking the pool.  I found this hotel to be an incredible value. With its sumptuous rooms outstanding hospitality well priced restaurant menus and importantly the best location in the Medina Including access to its resort outside the city walls I can't imagine another hotel could equal it.

I stayed there with a friend for 3 days in early April and was not disappointed. Not only is this little gem beautifully appointed with a poolside restaurant where we had terrific breakfasts and several dinners but the staff could not have been nicer. We received a call one morning when we didn't show up for breakfast after a late night. The staff wanted to make sure that we didn't miss the included breakfast. When I asked the concierge if he knew where there was an ATM that displayed in English (most were in Arabic and French) he had a staff member walk with me to show me where it was. Similarly we were provided with a VCR and some English language movies because there were only a few news channels in English. On our last day checkout was at noon and we were not scheduled to leave for Casablanca until 8PM. Both my travel partner and I had contracted a little cold and the concierge kindly provided us with a room where we could rest until our departure. The haman treatments are fabulous and they have cooking classes that we didn't have time to fit in.

La Maison Arabe,EdinburghMerchant wrote a review May 2016,50,"It has all been said already, but ought to be said again!",This riad/hotel is imaginatively conceived and wonderfully elegant. The web-site does not lie.    But notwithstanding its sophistication it is the way all of the staff greet you with warm smiles are ever helpful and make you feel instantly and always at home which is perhaps its most memorable feature.    The only slight drawback is that like most riads it offers some challenges for those with mobility problems but. a good proportion of rooms - not all - can be accessed by elevator. Otherwise be aware that some of the staircase steps are steeper than one would normally expect.    The dining area around the courtyard pool beats anything we have experienced and the food matches it with a choice of Moroccan and international offerings. And the Jazz Bar was the perfect place for pre and post dinner relaxing.    But at the risk of repetition the way staff engage with you and make you feel completely at home is the outstanding memory we took away.,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Edinburgh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdinburghMerchant
La Maison Arabe,SouthseaDoug wrote a review May 2016,50,Mobility Problems,MOBILITY PROBLEMS  No point is adding yet more accolades to those already given by many guests at this hotel. Of course it is superb. Well deserving five stars. First class facilities. Excellent staff training. And for us good value for money. In UK terms we paid approximately 190GBP per night including a superb breakfast in the idyllic setting of the “Trios Saveurs” restaurant for which we were happy to linger over an hour each morning. We ate twice in the evening in the same restaurant savouring not only the high standard of cuisine on offer but also the idyllic location and the soft live Moroccan music (different on both occasions we dined). My only reservation would be for any guests with mobility problems. Although the hotel has one lift/elevator connecting each floor it is only at one level and there are lots of flights connecting various levels/rooms/restaurants/bars.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Southsea,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SouthseaDoug
La Maison Arabe,2016Elise wrote a review May 2016,50,oasis of tranquility and beauty,La Maison Arabe is The Paradigm of hospitality. My husband teenage daughter and I stayed in a junior suite at La Maison for three nights. Had we not already booked and paid for the following portion of our trip we would have extended our stay. We were so comfortable so well taken care of so in awe of the beauty and attention to detail in both our room and the riad as a whole. Three nights wasn't enough to fully explore the mosaics paintings stenciling fixtures gardens bars and restaurants and pools. We arrived wanting to explore Marrakech dine out at a variety of different places but we found the restaurants at La Maison so excellent that we figured trying anywhere else would be a let down and opted to take all our meals in the hotel. Likewise while we had the energy to spend much more time in the medina staying put inside La Maison was such perfection that we opted to mill about inside rather than doing all the exploring and shopping we had planned. So there is the downside: La Maison is so perfect that you wont want to leave not for anything.,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2016Elise

We were three couples and all of the rooms were gorgeous. The beds were super comfy and bathrooms were really nice. We took advantage of the hotels amenities. We ate dinner in the dining room - it was expensive for Morocco but the $20 dinner was delicious and a good value for the money. They serve wine and a musician played lovely background music. They have a jazz bar and gave free sips of frosty drinks. We also experienced the Hammam (baths) - the spa was first class.

To start first with the staff they are exceptional and always ready to help. Checking in was a breeze. We were placed in the old wing but we loved the traditional decor and the balcony that is overlooking the court so we were very happy. The food was phenomenal breakfast was free with the meal and they make those amazing bread on-site to order. For dinner we ate at the hotel 3 nights of the 4 (one of the meal was at the market) and we enjoyed each and very meal. We would have loved to take a cooking class (the kitchen and the facility was looking very high tech and cool) but didn't sign up in time.

I cannot possibly give La Maison Arabe all the praise it deserves: superb service from ALL staff members gorgeous room with a balcony overlooking the pool an ultra comfortable bed and lovely amenities. The breakfast by the pool was an ideal way to begin the day and dinner in the traditional restaurant (after cocktails in the Jazz Bar) a perfect way to end it. The time spent in the spa (traditional hammam 4 hand massage manicure/pedicure) was blissful. The spa itself is an oasis of calm and beauty. Finally the hotel boutique is another delight for the senses. In a small space all of the best things that can be purchased in Marrakech are displayed with artistic skill and the prices are better than in the souks--without the chaos and need for bargaining.

La Maison Arabe offered a wonderful oasis of tranquillity with its lush courtyards swimming pool and sun terraces; not to mention the delicious food available in its two renowned restaurants. Our greeting and welcome cocktail were the openings and we knew this was going to be an excellent sejour! From plentiful breakfast buffet offering a cornucopia of Moroccan and European dishes including delicious Moroccan pancakes cooked to order homemade yoghurt fresh fruit and breads to the traditional tasting menu with highlights for us being the aromatic Moroccan salads and couscous and to inspired modern takes on Moroccan recipes including lamb shanks with pear - we could not fault anything. We went to the cookery school in the country club and really enjoyed the experience learning about traditions and the methodology of techniques. Thoroughly worthwhile. An excellent massage in the gorgeous hammam completed the feeling of total wellbeing. The general manager and staff went out of their way to make guests feel very much at home and one got the feeling that there was nothing too great a challenge for them.

The riad is just a superb place to be and the staff are a total delight with every one of them wanting to ensure your stay is thoroughly enjoyed. They are so attentive to your needs but at the same time never over bearing. From the rush of the souks coming back to the riad is like entering a quiet haven with all the comforts enjoying a tea in the courtyard or a lovely evening meal by the pool. We asked the reception if they could arrange a visit to the Atlas mountains (use Tourar Mohamed) and we had a driver for the day and the rate charged was less than we had gained off the internet. We had Momo the owner as the driver. He was a safe driver and had a wonderful life story to tell as he was a genuine Bedouin.

La Maison Arabe,Springjolie wrote a review Apr 2016,50,Lovely stay,My husband and I stayed at La Maison Arabe in March 2016. He already listed a review under Shahyad Esfandiary but as I truly loved this place I wanted to add my own. :)  The hotel itself is absolutely charming and feels very authentic (typical Morrocan riad). It has a lovely pool in the middle of the riad. Eating around the pool at night is just delightful!! The one negative about the pool (as somebody who loves to swim) is that the sun is on it in the morning and it is completely in the shadow as of about 1 pm; also it is next to the main restaurant so it feels a bit weird swimming while everyone around you is fully clothed having lunch. Now about the feel of the hotel: I have to say it is honestly one of the friendliest hotel I have ever stayed at. The staff is genuinely nice and they all do everything in their power to try and accommodate their clients to the utmost and make their stay the most pleasant possible!! My husband and I did have some issues with the room but they did everything they could to make up for it.

The SPA is a must!    If you are there for a few days take them up on the offer to go to the country club for a morning or afternoon. Beautiful garden with outdoor pool and a lot less crowded than the hotel.    The only thing stopping me from giving a 5 star review was that the service although extremely amicable and polite was often quite slow.    If this were a ""normal"" hotel it wouldn't have bothered me but for the money you pay you expect 5* service which was not always the case in terms of speed especially during breakfast where simple scrambled eggs could take up to 30 minutes to arrive.

La Maison Arabe,jfk1131 wrote a review Mar 2016,50,A very special hotel and experience,La Maison Arabe was perfection. Elegant old-world (but not stiff) service in an atmosphere that reflected something both traditionally Moroccan and something timeless. It felt more like an oasis in the middle of the fast-paced medina than merely a hotel. My room overlooking the pool was wonderful great bed tons of closet space yet I spent lots of time in the common areas relaxing reading and socializing with fellow travelers. Loved the dreamy outdoor restaurant. The hotel has it all: service décor excellent menu fantastic bar. For the quality offered I felt it was fairly priced. I didn’t go to their country annex pool until my last day and really regret not having discovered it earlier during my stay.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Chicago, Illinois",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jfk1131
La Maison Arabe,TravelingDenverMike wrote a review Mar 2016,50,Definitely a five star operation!,This is a hotel with service which includes remembering your name and serving you a bottle of wine to apologize for unexpected noise (incidental repairs). The restaurant is superb (although the most expensive we went to in Morocco) and we went all three nights we were in Marrakech. We also attended the cooking school a well organized and well worth it experience; and my wife did a spa treatment she liked very much. We spent an extra $500 here in three days with the dinners spa and cooking school; but it was well worth it.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Freeland, Washington",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingDenverMike

The hotel itself - very elegant and decoration very well suited. We were upgraded to a very beautiful room and a full sized kids bed was already set up for our little one. It wasn't requested. They just did it. They anticipate your needs and take care of it before you have to ask- like bring afternoon tea to you. There is always staff around to help you with whatever you need.

La Maison Arabe,smudgenozzy wrote a review Mar 2016,50,"Fabulous food, but......",We visited La Maison Arabe during our recent holiday to Marrakech. Going down an alleyway to an unassuming door which opens up to the most amazing interior is amazing. It was like stepping back in time to the 1940's. We were seated in reception and then given a guided tour starting with the music room where a pianist was playing. To say the Maison Arabe is like a Tardis is an understatement! There are many levels each as beautiful as the last.  When we reached the dining area we were blown away. Its beautiful. You are seated around a pool in a courtyard which is completely enclosed. There are beautiful plants and discreet lighting. As for the food.....its all good. I had the lamb tagine and Hubby had the fish. The food is beautifully served by waiters in very smart clothing. As were all the staff. Its an experience not to be missed. But with all the good points there are some negative ones too.    When we were in the piano room waiting for our table in the restaurant we had some drinks. I had the cocktail of the day and hubby had beer. When our waiter came for us we paid our drinks bill with cash and waited for the change. And waited ....and waited. It became clear that no change was forthcoming. Naughty. When we got to our table we were asked if we wanted water? Yes please we said. Sparkling for us and still for hubby. One glass each. On checking our bill we had been charged for a full bottle each. We were not told it was chargeable and we thought that quite underhand.    The customer toilets (one male one female) pens directly into the restaurant and as a gentleman had just visited and left the most disgusting stench it literally made me heave. Also they use small facecloths for drying of hands which are thrown in a basket after use....except they are re-used again and again. This is a serious health issue. Although the food and service was excellent the underhanded charging methods and the toilet issue is not something that needs to be addressed urgently.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Rochdale, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smudgenozzy
La Maison Arabe,Mazzuki wrote a review Mar 2016,40,Super stay at La Maison Arabe - will return!,Just a brief write-up to say how much we enjoyed our stay at La Maison Arabe. It certainly surpassed our expectations! The little things made all the difference...    We were immediately upgraded to a Junior Suite at no extra cost and there were fresh roses and a complimentary half-bottle of wine brought to our room. The room service was superb and speedily delivered. The super-king bed was incredibly comfortable with no sign of damp that a lot of the Riads in Marrakesh suffer from.    We left feeling well-taken care of very relaxed and felt that even though the cost was high compared to other Hotels in Marrakesh it was well worth it and agreed we would return as soon as we could!    Little things we would change:    It would have been nice to have 'free' coffee in the room given the price of the rooms.  We were told the pool was heated which was important as in March out of the sun the days can be cold but it was not - when we enquired why we were told there weren't many people about. They did then organise for the pool water to be heated up but said it would take up to 4-5hrs - so by that time it would've been early evening.    It would have made all the difference too to be able to actually sit by the poolside but there was only sunbathing decks away from the pool.    Saying all that as I said it was a lovely break in a 5* establishment and we left very happy. Mostafa and the Manager are to be applauded for their outstanding level of service to their guests - nothing was too much trouble.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Houston, Texas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mazzuki

La Maison Arabe,OnAir58408916032 wrote a review Mar 2016,50,Magical Visit to Marrakech!,Spent a week at the La Maison Arabe at the end of February and it couldn't have been better! The riad was gorgeous--not in a showy glitzy sort of way that you get in many hotels today. Rather it was wonderfully restored with beautiful artifacts rugs tilework lighting (oh the lighting!) etc. Every item seemed to have been carefully curated to create a sense of the magic and history that one might envision in Marrakech. The first part of my trip was spent in a junior room (patio side) which I was quite happy with--large beautiful tilework in the bathroom. When I decided to extend my stay a lovely young woman at the front desk graciously upgraded me to a suite (#243) which was exquisite. Very large with 2 room bathroom separate bed and living area with fireplace and a wonderfully large balcony with patio furniture to sit and enjoy the music from the guitar players in the courtyard. The porter came each evening to make a fire. While beautiful it was the service which really set them apart. Every single person --from the front desk to the porters to the staff in the restaurants--everyone--went out of their way to ensure that I was delighted...and they succeeded! The spa and hammam were wonderful--and again only added to the ambience. I could go on about the food--which was magnificent. The breakfast was amazing--I am still dreaming about the Moroccan bread and crepes--to the pastries with afternoon tea--to the dinners. Both restaurants were superb--and the classical guitar and lute musicians were fantastic and only added to what was already a simply magical stay. You can bet that La Maison Arabe will be my choice the next time I am in Marrakech!,Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Nashville, Tennessee",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnAir58408916032

The service was outstanding and staff were friendly warm and kind helpful at all times. They went out of their way to make us feel welcome and to meet our every need. The reception staff were especially helpful and I particularly appreciated one of the team (sadly I didn’t ask his name and he didn’t have a name badge!) who just got on the phone and rearranged our independent Atlas mountain trip for us when bad weather was forecast.    The hotel is beautifully and sumptuously decorated with countless handcrafted artefacts to marvel at. It is an oasis of calm in the hectic medina.    There was a wonderful array of food on offer for breakfast and we also ate delicious tagines and couscous dishes for dinner in the Moroccan restaurant. We looked forward to our reviving afternoon mint tea and pastries which we enjoyed in one of the many comfortable sitting areas dotted around the hotel.    The beautiful hammam was quiet and relaxing and offers some good value treatment packages though we didn’t have time to try these. We just used the steam room.    We also loved the relaxing by the pool in the secluded environment at the hotel’s country club with its gorgeous gardens. We were intrigued to see the bread for the hotel being made in clay ovens there. We visited 3 times and were very well looked after by Mohammed the country club manager. The free hotel shuttle bus service was very efficient.

La Maison Arabe,dkrobel wrote a review Feb 2016,50,Fantastic hotel in central location,La Maison Arabe is a top rated hotel for a reason. The style and finish of the hotel is superb full of local tapestries rugs and riad/courtyard-style architecture. You truly feel the luxurious Arab theme which is what we were after on our first trip to Morocco. The staff were perhaps the best part of the experience as they cater to all your needs and help with any arrangements required for excursions away from the hotel. They even had doormen run to the corner shop to get things for us. Staff always greeted with a smile and you never feel like you're troubling them when needing assistance. The two restaurant offered great food - top notch. We ate at the top 3 rated fine dining places in Marrakech and La Maison being one of them was deserving of the rating. This comes at a price however but you don't go to a hotel like this on a budget! The Hammam & Spa was also a treat. The ladies were very professional the atmosphere just perfect and the treatment was wonderful (hammam and massage). Definitely use this if you stay there. The hotel also offers an offsite cooking school with another outdoor pool and garden area about 15 minutes drive from the main hotel. This is not to be missed! Cooking classes were a surprising highlight with amazing facilities and instruction. And we were so impressed by the pool area that we spent our entire last day just relaxing there.

La Maison Arabe,sjp44 wrote a review Feb 2016,50,"Amazing Hotel, First class staff, Great location",This was a 4 night stay to celebrate my Wife 50th birthday. We chose it for the excellent reviews and with only 26 rooms it really was the perfect choice for a romantic birthday treat. We loved the location its tucked away so you'd never know about the oasis behind its high walls. The layout of the hotel is quite unusual but this adds to the charm. The relaxing areas are intimate well thought out and beautifully presented.  A pleasant surprise was a free room upgrade at check in. The staff on reception were always friendly and understand how to give you advice (thank you very much Hakeem) whether walking to a local restaurant or organising a trek to the Atlas Mountains. We loved the Spa. There is also a heated pool but we didn't manage to use it.  The only (very small) negative which is outside the hotels control of course were road works nearby (pneumatic drills). Whilst the high walls helped the noise would carry over the top of the hotel so you could hear it when having the complimentary afternoon tea.  Breakfast was always something to look forward to - Moroccan Crepes with onions olives tomatoes and cheese was a first for us made fresh you cant beat it. We celebrated my wife 50th Birthday at the Moroccan restaurant. It surprised us how may external guests came to eat at there but discovered why - it is in the top 20 best places to eat in the city. The slow cooked lamb was my favourite.  We would definitely go back thoroughly recommend it. There are so are many other things we could point out.

I am not normally the sort of person who stays at the same place all the time but there are a number of things about La Maison Arabe which make it a must. You can take as read that it is beautiful comfortable luxurious etc and that the food is excellent. This time I want to talk about the staff and service. Quite honestly there is nothing that would faze them I don't think and if I had a serious issue I would think Adil and the team could solve anything quickly and professionally. But there's a further element to this excellent service - it is done with professionalism charm and humour. Some of the staff have a great desire to have fun with the guests and interact with them. I like this and it is to the management's credit that this is encouraged. They tell you that the hotel is your home in Marrakech and this is clearly the effect they strive for. So if you need help getting to and from places they help you. They offer a mobile phone so you can call if you get lost.  The hotel has another USP which is the country club or garden a few minutes away by minibus. It is absolutely gorgeous and tranquil and you can easily spend the day there should you wish.

The hotel has lovely sitting areas and courtyards and our room was charming and very comfortable.  We had planned to have most dinners out but ended up at the hotel restaurant multiple evenings because of the menu the beautiful surroundings and the excellent service. Everyone from the bellman to the front desk to the waiters was helpful warm and friendly - without being at all intrusive. The Hamam & massage were wonderful. The breakfast is generous and delicious.

We sat in a cozy lounge with several little nooks with tables and chairs or sofas. There was also a courtyard as well.

La Maison Arabe,John & Austin wrote a review Jan 2016,50,Fabulous Trip,Where do I start!    We had booked a patio facing room some months back excited about the stay as the reviews on here for the hotel were so good.    We are a gay couple so were rather nervous about staying here. We had contacted the hotel in advance confirming to see if this was going to be problematic but they welcomed us anyway.    When we arrived they took our bags and directed us to sit in the courtyard whilst they checked us in. We were then lead around the hotel by the manager. The hotel is a traditional Riad or should I say a number of Riads all stuck together to make one large hotel.    The hotel has two restaurants a lovely swimming pool/courtyard a spa and a jazz bar.    The decor is modern and sophisticated and designed similar to a boutique hotel.    Once the tour was over the manager lead us to our room and they had upgraded us to the Alibaba suite (217). The room was beautiful (see photos attached).    We had our own courtyard living room huge bathroom and bedroom. The bed was lovely and comfortable. We were provided with a small bottle of wine and some water on arrival and some lovely roses were also provided in our room.    We ate at the restaurant enjoying a traditional tagine. This was lovely and priced appropriately (£15).    The location of the hotel was great being situated a 10 minute walk to all local sites.

La Maison Arabe,DarrenHinckley wrote a review Jan 2016,50,Exceptional Hotel in every way,We simply couldn't fault a single thing!  This is a luxury traditional Riad situated in the heart of the Madina yet couldn't be more tranquil  From the special requests we required prior to arrival nothing was too much trouble. Without exception every single member of staff are always smiling & want to help.  They arranged an excellent guide to show us around the Madina (very reasonable) which was well worth doing as he was very knowledgable.  Would highly recommend their Moroccan cooking class which was extremely professional and slick (felt like walking on to the set of Masterchef!)  We were there for New Year's Eve so although not cheap we booked the Gala dinner which again was excellent (and included an open bar)  We stayed in a suite & our son and girlfriend in a standard room - both were of a high standard (our suite was well worth the extra pennies if budget allows.

La Maison Arabe,Flanbroon wrote a review Jan 2016,50,An oasis of calm,Our first visit to Marrakech. We arrived at night and were a bit apprehensive about where the taxi driver was stopping. However within a few seconds uniformed hotel staff were on hand to take care of us. We were ushered to a garden courtyard and served with a delicious welcoming drink whilst the check-in procedures were taken care of for us. After a short tour we were given a complimentary upgrade to a suite with a view of the garden and pool.    Throughout our stay we were beautifully looked after by all the staff with not even the smallest detail overlooked. It was if they could anticipate our thoughts! Within the hotel a 10% charge is automatically added to services provided by the hotel (additional meals spa treatments etc). However this is fully justified as all of the staff go above and beyond to make your stay a memorable one.    The food in the hotel is lovely and again the service is impeccable. The only downside to this was the expectation it set when we tried other local restaurants (none were as good). Complimentary afternoon tea was also nice when we returned from our explorations of the local area and there were some lovely quiet areas in the Riad to relax in.  We also enjoyed spa treatments in the Hammam which are the best we have ever experienced. We attended the New Year's Eve gala dinner where we were treated to a 10 course meal with unlimited drinks and various local entertainments. This was a great end to our last evening at the hotel.

La Maison Arabe,Andrew W wrote a review Jan 2016,50,Amazing...the best ever hotel we stayed at,I know this review will sound like I'm gushing but it's all true. From the moment my husband and I walked through the front door through the final good byes by the excellent staff it was nothing but awesome. Like so much of Marrakech the beauty faces inward. The building is the product of a lavish renovation of three older mansions that made us feel like we were guests of a Moorish palace. The amenities were superb from the two elegant restaurants to the relaxing spa. But I leave my greatest praises for the incredible staff who was always able to anticipate our every need or whim. Unfortunately I got deathly sick eating tainted chicken at Richard Branson's mansion but I can only imagine how much worse it could have been if I had stayed anywhere else. From the doctor they called for me at 11:30 at night (yes...a house call) to the special diet they prepared for me every day it was nothing less than a godsend. After that I was quickly on the mend. I truly felt like an Arab queen. We will certainly return very soon.

From the moment we arrived we were made to feel at home with complimentary tea whilst the paperwork was sorted and our luggage was taken to our room. We were then given a tour of the Riad and its amenities. We were told that complimentary tea would be served every afternoon - on our return each day we ordered English tea to our room which was served with a family size pot and sweet pastry delicacies - and true to their word it was complimentary and not charged to the bill. The Riad is beautiful as was our room and the private patio allowed us to completely relax. Nothing is too much trouble the staff will do everything in their power to make your visit as relaxing and pleasurable as possible.

La Maison Arabe,renwall wrote a review Jan 2016,50,Absolutely perfect,Staying at La Maison Arabe is a wonderful magical experience. The Riad itself is gorgeous but what really sets this place apart is the service. Every detail is accounted for and the entire staff is so helpful and kind. The food is excellent as well as the spa services. Definitely don't miss the breakfast buffet the tea service and the Hammam.    We also hired guides and drivers exclusively through the hotel. One day we did a walking tour of Jemaa el Fna and the souks and the next day we took a trip to the Atlas mountains. It was great to have trusted reliable sources to show us around educate us on history and culture and take us to the best local merchants for shopping.    I really can't say enough good things about La Maison Arabe. I had a stomachache my second day there (no fault of the hotel) and several members of the staff made me tea with fresh thyme and rosemary and asked how I was feeling. They let me order à la carte from the restaurant and helped me choose foods that wouldn't aggravate my stomach further. The bartender in the Jazz room made me a complimentary juice drink with cumin in it which was really delicious.    Adil Chaif the Front Office Manager deserves a special mention. He assisted with planning our daily itineraries and helped us with anything and everything we needed.    The employees at La Maison Arabe tell you that they want your stay in Morocco to be enjoyable and memorable and they really deliver. I just left and already I can't wait to go back. Next time I'll try the cooking class the local restaurants Adil suggested and take a trip to the Sahara.

La Maison Arabe,Fadh1 wrote a review Jan 2016,50,Excellent place,This was our first visit to Morocco. We were trying to make it for quiet some times now but it got delayed since we were not sure where to stay. From the moment where we were picked up from Marrakech airport till we left to Fez the Management of La Maison Arabe had extended their hospitality beyond our expectation. They arranged the pick up (for a price). Our room was upgraded to meet our comfort zone. The breakfast and dinner were excellent and authentic to the area. It is an amazing place the inside setup as an original Riad. The people who served us were sincere and talented they are ready to look after minor details. The neighbourhood is in the historic part of Marrakech yet it is within an easy access to the main road.

La Maison Arabe,ElineM wrote a review Dec 2015,50,Perfect stay,We visited La Maison Arabe in the end of december 2015. The vibe of the riad is just perfect we fell in love with this place.    The room was beautiful we had our own terrace. We were welcomed by a very friendly staff who stayed interested proactive and very helpful throughout our stay. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere in the evening the food is really good and there was live music. On the last day we treated ourselves with a nice massage. And we must say this is one of the best we ever had! After the massage Racheed asked us to come to the jazz bar right away. And so we did. A musician was playing there was a cozy fire and we were welcomed with a mocktail. But that was not all. Since it was Dries' birthday the staff started singing happy birthday and he got a jummie cake. That was so nice!  Maison Arabe also has a country club 15 minutes from the riad. Also a perfect place to have lunch or take a sun bath (the pool is very could though ;-))  We would therefor recommend La Maison Arabe to anyone who wants to have a perfect romantic stay in Marrakech.

La Maison Arabe,simonc762014 wrote a review Dec 2015,40,Beautiful Riad,Riad is in a very convenient location close to all the main attractions. Staff are extreemly helpful and will assist you in all things - from ordering a local taxi pointing you to areas of interest nearby and securing a guide for the day. The building is impeciably maintained and decorated throughout - it is clean relaxing sumptuously lit and a real joy to spend time in - a real feast for the eyes! Breakfast was good but I can imagine the variety becoming a little tedious after more than a 5 day stay. The home-made yoghurt was delicious though! They offer free tea and coffee in the afternoon a choice of coffee would have been nice - we were genuinely very thirsty and an expresso did little to quench that thirst whilst a caffe latte would have been just right! The jazz bar was nice again beautifully decorated and well lit adorned with impressive paintings and objects and great for a drink or two but a little too much on the sedate side for us to make a real night of it. This is an expensive hotel; meals drinks any spa treatments are all on the pricey side - therefore it was a shame to discover such small amenieties as using the steam room was charged at around £12 for a 20 minute session - something I've never paid for at any other hotel! This was a shame as the swimming pool being right next to the restaurant seating also detered us from taking a dip. The country club was a really nice bonus and when they have coverted to heat the swimming pool later on next year it will serve as a great place to sit (and swim) all year around. Room keeping was really good as was the wifi - a few more English speaking TV channels would not have gone amiss. I loved all of the meals that I ate at their two restaraunts - found the international food to be really good. Again all the staff were very warm and welcoming and their attitudes and professionalism befit that any five staff hotel. Both ourselves and another couple of guests noticed the smell of smoke that seemed to permeate our rooms at certain times of the days....the riad has many fireplaces in it and whilst our was not used we wondered if it was a result of the chimneys not being reguarly cleaned...I don't know but both me and my partner woke up every morning with the dryest of mouths coughing and with the smell of smoke firmly in our nostrils. The smell was sometime worse on our small balcony forcing us to close the windows/doors most nights. The air quality in Marrakech is not the best either so I cannot hold the riad fully accountable for this but I think this is maybe something the riad could look into. All in all a very beautiful classy civilized relaxed and friendly place with great staff and service with just a few minor tweeks to make.,Date of stay: December 2015,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simonc762014

La Maison Arabe,Alex B wrote a review Dec 2015,50,Beautiful Riad and Fantastic Service,Located just inside the edges of the Medina which makes it very convenient to either walk further into the Medina (the main square is a 15 minute walk) or catch a taxi to head into the new city. There are convenience shops a pharmacy cheap cafes and nice restaurants all within a block or two.    Unassuming from the outside beautiful on the inside. This is a full service riad complete with two restaurants a heated pool solarium private hammam a jazz bar patio off site gardens a cooking school and more. There's even a boutique owned by the hotel around the corner where you can buy goods in a hassle free environment.    We reserved a patio side room and I asked if they could give us a room with a fireplace if available - in response they upgraded us to a patio suite with a fireplace at no extra charge. The suite was just like the photos on the web site or even a little bit nicer. It included a nice salon where we could relax and read a flat screen TV in each room so I could watch some soccer one evening double vanity sinks beautiful furniture and multiple windows that could be opened for fresh air. I think the bathroom was heated by the hammam downstairs which sent heat up through some vents beneath the sinks. Efficient and charming. We loved it!    There is a buffet breakfast by the pool every morning it was excellent. There was the expected fruit breads cheese meats etc as well as an omelet and pancake station. The freshly made yogurt which was delicious. There is also a complimentary mint tea service in the afternoon complete with tasty baked sweets.    We only had dinner in the hotel once because we were usually exploring the medina in the evening. But the dinner that we had was excellent.    The hotel pool is heated but small and right next to one of the restaurants. We didn't really care to use it but I think we would have felt awkward using it next to dining guests. They have another larger pool that is off site at the gardens. Not sure if it's heated.    The hammam looked very nice though we didn't use it either so I can't comment further on that.    One other thing to note is that the hotel adds a 10% tip to all standard services that is distributed evenly to the staff. While some may not like that I actually appreciated it because I think 10% is very reasonable it removes any awkward tipping situations and you get to keep your small bills which can be extremely useful when shopping or paying for other services outside the hotel. More than any other country I've been to it's important in Morocco to have small bills with you because a lot of people simply won't break large bills so not tipping cash in the hotel helped. That said I tipped on a few occasions for unusual requests.    One odd thing was that the coffee in the room was $3 per cup/pod - one of those Keurig machines. Not a big deal as we just went downstairs for coffee that was included in our breakfast but I thought it was unusual especially in such a nice hotel. I've never been asked to pay for coffee in a room before. Come to think of it most places we stayed in Morocco didn't have coffee in the room at all so maybe that's typical.    All of the places we stayed throughout Morocco offered wifi but it was often slow or the connection was dodgy. However the wifi here is excellent. You are assigned a connection specific to your room so I'm guessing each room has its own access point. This made the connection very reliable and the speed was pretty good. After all the other flaky wifi experiences we had in other cities and hotels this was a welcome treat.    Aside from the beautiful hotel and our suite the service was outstanding. On arrival they took our bags and gave us a table by the pool with some refreshing non-alcoholic drinks while they finished prepping our room. Then they gave us a tour of all the riad amenities followed by a tour of our suite where there was a bottle of wine waiting for us.    Housekeeping provided a large bottle of water each day and cleaned the room twice per day while we were out. On one occasion they were cleaning our room when we returned so we went to the jazz bar to wait for them to finish. The bar manager greeted us and was very friendly. We told him we were just waiting for our room to be cleaned and he insisted on giving us some refreshing non-alcoholic drinks on the house while we waited. Very nice.    The riad manager was fantastic. He was very eager to help with any questions we had about the city directions etc. One afternoon I asked him if he knew any place where I could watch the Liverpool soccer game that was going to be televised that evening. I had already checked and the hotel didn't get the proper channel. He said he could probably recommend a place but that he would ask his staff to see if they could add that channel so I could watch the game in our suite. We were heading out for a few hours and he said to check with him when we got back. When we returned he told me it was all set up in our room. When we entered the room the game was already tuned in on both TV's to the new channel with the volume set to a soft level. Now that is nice service!    Beautiful riad convenient location lovely staff excellent food.

The rooms are just beautiful.

La Maison Arabe,ljljrichco wrote a review Dec 2015,50,Perfect respite in the medina,La Maison Arabe was a perfect respite after ten days traveling through Morocco. Their greeting was more than gracious. Sitting in the charming Riad drinking our welcome beverage we knew we were in the right place. Our room was in the newer wing. It was large beautifully designed comfortable and completely quiet. It overlooked the pool and dining area.    Sitting at the edge of the medina it is a very short walk to most of the important sites in the old city. We felt perfectly safe walking to and from the Jamaâ El-fna late in the evening.    We had planned to eat in the restaurant only one evening but it was so good we decided that after exhausting ourselves the second day we would stay in for dinner. Their seafood bastilla was the best dish I ate in Morocco. Drinks in the Jazz bar beforehand were also a treat.    We loved our stay here.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Denver, Colorado",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ljljrichco
La Maison Arabe,Oum_Sam wrote a review Nov 2015,50,A fantastic and beautiful place,We chose this place after reading good reviews about it on Trip Advisor. We were very happy and comfortable there. The staff were very friendly and obliging. We booked a standard room with a garden view. We were upgraded to a suite with a garden view which was very nice. However the next morning we woke up to construction banging and lots of noise. We complained about it to the front desk and they apologized profusely. That was the business next to them who were renovating. In any case by the time we had finished our breakfast they offered us a change of room and this time to the royal suite :). That was surprising and very sweet of them. They have two royal suites and we stayed in one of them. The suite consisted of three levels; the first one had a huge sitting area a big screen TV and a complete bathroom. The top level had the bedroom overlooking the first floor another big screen TV and another complete bathroom. By complete I mean toilet double sinks bathtub and a shower. The bathrooms were well stocked. They made sure to go in and freshen up every time we left the room. The third level had a private terrace with a jacuzzi .  When you check in this Riyad they offer you a drink by the pool while they process your papers. Then they would take you for a tour of the place and give you a little history about it. There are two restaurants and a bar as well as many courts and sitting areas.  Our stay included breakfast which was served outside by the pool or at your room and afternoon tea served wherever you want. Many choices and a variety of food for breakfast served by wonderful staff.  We had our dinners there too. We've enjoyed every bit of it tremendously. We decided not to eat in the market to avoid any unfortunate food intolerance etc.  This Riyad is located in the old Madina and within a walking distance of Jame al Fena Bahia palace and other historical areas.  It is a good idea to order a pick up from the airport or the train station wherever your point of arrival is. We ordered it it through the Riyad.  If we ever visit Marrakesh again La Maison Arabe will be our choice of accommodation.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Peterborough, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Oum_Sam
La Maison Arabe,Desiree Fish wrote a review Nov 2015,50,You feel like royalty!,This restaurant is in a Riad in the old town and we had heard great thing so had to try. So glad we went. It's a beautiful Riad and you walk through beautifully decorated rooms to step into the restaurant in a sunken room that is all red. The tables around the room are positioned to face the center and the musicians played traditional Moroccan music.    The food is traditional too. We order the Moroccan salads many small plates of cooked and sautéed vegetables. All spiced perfectly. Then I ordered the lamb tajina (different from a tagine) slowly cooked lamb in its own clay pot for hours. It was SO tender and delicious! My husband had the chicken couscous with vegetables. Huge portions and all wonderful. We had a rose Medallion Moroccan wine and we were too full for dessert. But we finished with mint tea.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Parisfan2000
La Maison Arabe,Philipe45 wrote a review Nov 2015,50,"Excellent Riad, take a day trip to the Atlas mountains",Beautifully decorated has three restaurants with excellent food very comfortable rooms and friendly and very attentive staff. It's an oasis of calm in the middle of the medina. as I would like to recommend a day trip to the Atlas mountains for For anyone visiting Marrakech.  After a couple of days in the hectic city we realised we wanted to escape and experience a little more of the scenery and culture of Morocco .  Going on line to look at day trip possibilities I found Trekkinginmorocco.net who appeared to offer just what we needed . I emailed them and had a very swift reply from Ahmed who described the day visit to the High Atlas mountains it would cost 130 US dollars for both of us and no money need be paid in advance .  We were picked up promptly at 0900 from our La Maison Arabe in a roomy vehicle and started our drive out of the city . Our first stop was at a traditional village and an argon oil cooperative . The process was explained to us there was no pushing to sell and everything was relaxed and friendly . We then continued our climb up into the mountains with amazing views and had an opportunity to ride a camel which was included in the tour cost .  After a couple of minutes we reached our destination Imlil a small village nestling amongst the highest peaks of North Africa . Walnut and apple trees and snow on the mountains  made it very special . We were met by the owner of Trekking in Morocco.net and our guide Ibraham and given a warm welcome .  Tea and cake on a terrace and Ibraham asked us how we would like to spend the day . There were options for length of walk and a vehicle drive to a higher village . We could trek on foot or ride a mule . We walked for about one and a half hours through small Berber villages to a waterfall meeting many local people and our guide explained the local customs and culture whilst we were surrounded by incredible views .  Lunch was splendid . On a terrace high up above Imlil . Berber cuisine tajine salad fruit and mint tea and nothing rushed . We then continued on a short walk to experience life in a Berber house met the family and my wife had a Henna tattoo on her hand . Ibraham interpreted our questions and explained clearly to us the Berber way of life .  About 1600 hours we met our driver and started our return journey to Marrakech. On the way back we detoured to a remote village where the driver explained saw few tourists and was a very special place for the Berber people . We felt very privileged .  Arriving back at our hotel about 1830 hours we paid the agreed price to our driver And a tip for his excellent safe driving and courteous manner .  My wife and I agreed this day trip was the highlight of our Morocco visit . For the price it was fantastic value and gave us a personalised experience everlasting memories great photographs and an opportunity to meet the Berber people and learn about their culture and customs .  We recommend TREKKINGINMOROCCO.NET for anyone visiting Morocco.,Date of stay: November 2015,,"Greater Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Philipe45
La Maison Arabe,R L wrote a review Nov 2015,50,Outstanding! Cannot imagine finding a better place to stay in Marrakech!!,I had the pleasure of staying at this historic riad the first one in Marrakech I am told. This has to be the one to set the standards for all other riad-hotels. Frankly I did not know a riad from a hotel when making the booking. I was looking for a place to stay that had good customer service and strong wifi because of my business needs. Well this riad's wifi was indeed excellent. But what I did not expect was the amazing lodging experience. The location was in my opinion perfect. A short walk to the famous market which was an adventure in itself. The riad itself was simply beautiful and clearly someone put so much thought into the design of each and every room including all the public spaces. The front desk staff were always on the top of their game as was the housekeeping staff and all the waiters/servers. The breakfast was outstanding both in terms of food quality food choices and the quality of the staff members. Their smiles each morning and their customer service orientation were second to none. And dinner. What a positive experience as well. The food was outstanding . . . and impeccably prepared.    If you want to have an outstanding lodging experience I strongly recommend La Maison Arabe.

The staff were amazing both restaurants fantastic and the free suite upgrade incredible. Despite not telling the hotel they notice when we checked in that it was my birthday and so they arranged a cake with our evening meal and also drinks in the bar completely free. This level of attention to detail shows a team of people that want to excel at their job. The whole ambiance is just what we were looking for and we will certainly be back.

La Maison Arabe,Walid S wrote a review Nov 2015,50,FABULOUS! Best Place to stay in Marrakech!,Stayed there for a week with my girlfriend in August 2015 was simply amazing. One of the best hospitality experience I've ever had The quality of the staff and service is absolutely outstanding they are friendly professional and always here to help & assist.    The hotel itself is a true luxurious Riad with a legit history decoration is fabulous bedrooms are amazing spacious extremely clean view from balcony is sweet. Seriously it even looks better than in pictures.    Welcoming drinks are a courtesy of the mixologist of the place Rachid awesome dude by the way. Restaurant is ... wait for it....Delicious!!!! Moroccan food at its finest and famous for that in the city. Loved the breakfast there as well.    Location is perfect and very convenient literally 5 minutes walking distance from the Jemaa El Fna place you're in the heart of the city area is VERY safe had many walks around any given time of the night.    The country club of the Hotel is also exceptional a driver can take you there any time of the day (10 minutes driving distance). Large swimming cool surrounded by a beautiful garden. Service there is also amazing and the restaurant is very affordable. Shout-out to Mohammed the Manager of the country club his hospitality skills are truly amazing and his kindness is hardly beatable.    You can also enjoy relaxing spas and massages for about 50$ the hour back to the Hotel. We have been upgraded in a suite as soon as we dropped our luggages on the entrance.    Cherry on top of the Cake? We even made new friends visiting Marrakech and staying in the same hotel!

Unfortunately there was a private party and the restaurant was closed that night but it worked out well because we went and sat in the enchanting old world bar had cocktails and listened to music. Because I was so enamored with this place I asked the manager to show me a room. It was absolutely charming and I know that this is where we will be staying when we return.

La Maison Arabe,eos99 wrote a review Nov 2015,50,Love this place - want to come back!,Jan 30 to Feb 6 2014 - Everything about this hotel is excellent (staff service rooms food)! We stayed at La maison arabe for a total of 3 nights (2 nights on arrival and decided to come back for our last night since we loved it so much). Both times the staff and service was excellent from the moment we walked in. We were greeted upon arrival and they served us Moroccan mint tea in the parlor. Adil and staff assisted us in every way possible. I read rave reviews about the hotel on Trip Advisor books other travel sites/magazines and this place did not disappoint.    Location and Rooms - it's within walking distance of all the main attractions inside and outside the medina. It's also located right next to the second largest mosque in the city so the announcement for the call to prayer broadcasted over the speakers can be loud. The neighborhood doesn't look like much and neither does the exterior facade but inside its very well decorated with ornate Moroccan details at every corner. We booked at the last minute and got the ground level room 210 with the private patio (no view). The room didn't have a lot of natural light coming in but was beautiful and very clean. Bed was super comfortable with clean white linens and a soft fluffy white duvet (real rose petals were scattered on the bed and throughout the room on our initial arrival which was over the top but thoughtful). Bathroom was very clean as well with all amenities. On our second visit they gave us the balcony suite (room 245) overlooking the pool for just slightly more than what we paid for our first room. The upgrade was a courtesy since we came back. The room was excellent! Same comments as above and even better. Room was much bigger and had a lounge area and the bathroom had a separate shower with 2 types of shower heads (one was rainforest) and a bathtub with shower. No rose petals scattered in the room this time but probably because we showed up last minute without a reservation (we initially planned on staying in Imlil for our last night but I got sick from the altitude so we came back early to Marrakech).    Wifi service - There was free wifi throughout the hotel pool and inside the rooms. Once you connected to the right SSID the connection was good (my boyfriend was able to work remotely from the hotel).    Food - The breakfast buffet was amazing on the gorgeous pool terrace one of the hotel highlights. In addition to the selections of pastries meats fresh fruit juices etc. they had crepe and omelet stations. Do try the homemade vanilla yogurt in the cute glass jars - yum! The staff also made every effort to remember what kind of tea or omelet we had the day before (the hotel serves Tchaba brand tea which is amazing wish I had bought some to take home as the tea is only available in the Middle East and Marrakech). We also had dinner twice at the hotel's restaurant which was also excellent! I had the chicken tajine with stewed tomatoes both times and my boyfriend had the beef tajine with orange and cinnamon on the first visit and same dish with lamb on the second visit. The meats were super tender (chicken falling off bone). By far the best meal during our entire Morocco trip. Both restaurants also accommodated our gluten allergy and made us fresh cornbread in place of their regular bread offering.    Sure this place is on the pricey side but you get what you pay for. If we come back to Marrakech we would no doubt stay here again and would love to take the cooking class that they offer. We highly recommend la maison arabe for any kind of visit to this exciting city.,Date of stay: December 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York, NY",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eos99
La Maison Arabe,hockiemack wrote a review Nov 2015,40,Amazing Riad,We stayed here after reading the great reviews and learning we could use our credit card points to book.    We were given a junior suite that overlooked the pool.    Thanks to prior tripadvisor reviews we brought a couple bottles of wine from duty free. The room included a small bottle of wine gratis. A large bottle of water was free daily too.    The room and bathroom are amazing. The shower has a couple options for rain shower vs regular. Pressure is great. The soaps and lotions smell divine.    I took a bath in the separate tub which was lovely.    We spent some time on our terrace drinking wine and appreciating the weather.    We took the cooking class one day which was great and quite modern. You can specify if you're gluten free or veggie etc.    At their satellite site they have a much better pool with better lounging space. The shuttle is free to get there.    We opted to use the hotel taxi to get there which worked out perfectly. It was 200 dhr but worth it for peace of mind.    Souks (shopping) is walking distance.    The hotel lounge and restaurants are great. They'll serve you food anywhere.    The only downside was the proximity to the mosque resulted in loud prayers that could wake you from sleep. Turn on the AC and it'll drown out that noise.

La Maison Arabe,MysoreBound wrote a review Nov 2015,50,A gem,We booked ten days at Maison Arabe after reading its TripAdvisor reviews. We like small hotels with character and great service and Maison Arabe certainly didn't disappoint.    Its best feature by far is its staff. Friendly and warm nothing is too much trouble for them. They truly want guests to enjoy their stay and will go out of their way to make it so. After I shyly asked if they would have gluten free bread it appeared at my table every day and also fabulous GF cakes. The waiters always serve you with a smile the ladies who prepare the omelettes and pancakes at breakfast are lovely and the staff who clean the rooms do so with a warm smile.    The managers at reception always check that you are satisfied with everything and they arranged a trip to the Atlas Mountains with a super attentive driver who got us there very safely (important when the roads are narrow and winding up steep mountains).    Everyone onsite speaks English and French and quite often other languages.    The hotel is a Riad with a lot of personality. Our room (Aladdin 216) was on the top floor and was comfortable and spacious and had a little private terrace which made afternoons reading the papers quite nice.    We tried both restaurants the Moroccan one and the international restaurant by the pool and quickly settled on the latter for most of our dinners. The hotel started its life as a restaurant and it shows; the food was great (my husband enthusiastically recommends the chicken and preserved lemon tajine).    The hotel really comes alive in the evening. With superb lighting dinner is a lively yet romantic affair with live music and a jazz bar for a post-dinner drink.    In short from the moment you arrive until you leave you are incredibly well looked after. We booked the airport transfers through them and they took care of all the details from checking us into the hotel while we relaxed with a refreshing drink to preparing our disembarkment cards for us before we left sending us off with a great smile and a bottle of water for the small journey to the airport.

The minute we walked in we were greeted with a cool refreshing drink and then shown round the stunning oasis of a mini palace. For a smallish hotel it had 2 restaurants and a piano bar  all extremely stunning and live music every night. On top of all that a hammam (spa) which must be indulged . Every member of staff was incredibly friendly and helpful and did everything that could to make us feel like royalty but not in a pompous uncomfortable way. Food was out of this world and so tasty  and 3 course meal with wine every night was less than £60 !!. Ideal location for visiting the famous square and strolling the souks especially great for a barter if your a salesman like me .  a must do thing if time is to visit the waterfalls at the atlas mountains  well well worth the journey .  a special thanks to Morat who could not have done more  we will be back !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  in our opinion No 1 raid on trip advisor.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Rochester,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidmM1340LI

I could not sleep the swimming pool very small is more for a decoration pool they do have another swimming pool like half hour in car from the hotel it is annoying because you spend 30 minutes going and 30 minutes coming back. It is a nice pool but the water is frozen the water should be heated. the hotel is very expensive 132Dh for a cold sandwich 283.25DH for lamb ribs. It is a rip off!! I don't understand how can be so expensive when the medium salaries are around 3000Dh/4000DH a month and living in Morocco is much cheaper than Europe.  I spent less money in 5 stars hotel by the beach and getting much more in Tenerife.  it doesn't make people to come back. You end spend so much money and getting nothing not much in return. No entertainment for adults nothing for kids the hotel is very small no place for kids to hang around.

It is steeped in the local culture and the most beautiful place to stay. The rooms were really comfortable and all the staff were friendly and nothing was too much trouble. We ate in the restaurant each night and the food was delicious. My 13 year old daughter has an allergy to dairy products but by day two all the waiting staff knew who she was and the chefs cooked for her accordingly.

The restaurants are good with a very high level of service and the food also good quality. It has a very good location in the Medina & the main square is about 10 mins walk away.

La Maison Arabe,corinne_ranaraja wrote a review Nov 2015,50,"Impeccable service, thoughtful & kind attention",Over the course of our 4-day stay La Maison Arabe found a place in our hearts.    I travelled to Marrakech with my 73-year-old mother and 2-year-old son and remain completely indebted to the staff at La Maison Arabe for making our stay memorable stress-free and wonderful.    From the moment we arrived at this magnificent property and were greeted by the effortlessly gracious Morat to the moment we left 4 days later no request was ever too much and more often than not we did not need to make requests as staff had thought of our needs even before we knew we had them.    We stayed in the Kamar Junior Suite which was ideal for us: ground floor private patio quiet part of the hotel generous bathroom and wardrobe well appointed bedroom. (Note: the dawn chorus of birds in the trees on the patio is impressively loud and can be a nuisance if you are a light sleeper but we found it quickly passed).    We chose to have breakfast at the beautiful poolside every morning. The buffet was extensive and included home made pastries and juices as well as Moroccan pancakes and your choice of eggs etc.    We ate dinner at the poolside restaurant several times. The quality of the meals (both Moroccan and Western) was simply phenomenal - everything was absolutely delicious. The room service menu seemed relatively limited but the hotel easily and happily arranged for restaurant food to be brought to our room at no extra cost.    We were able to visit the hotel’s sister site (a 20 mins free shuttle ride away) which is an oasis of calm and beauty. It’s worth making a trip there if you want a little respite from the dusty medina.    The location of the hotel is excellent for anyone who wants to stay in the medina within walking distance of the sights (it’s a 10 mins uncomplicated walk to Place Jemaa el Fnaa). The hotel sits in a little pedestrian alleyway bordered by two main thoroughfares and is easily recognisable from these main causeways – i.e. you don’t have to wind your way through interminable indistinguishable alleyways to reach the hotel. We always felt safe when returning at night on foot.    As I was travelling with a toddler I was particularly grateful for the hotel’s invaluable support with the smaller details of our stay such as securing taxis at an appropriate rate giving directions and reliable advice about the locale sights and customs all of which rendered our stay as smooth as it could be.    On our first day we took a guide recommended to us by the hotel for three hours. Whilst the guide himself was of medium quality (he seemed slightly tired and unenthused) it was absolutely the right thing to do as he was entirely at our disposal for three hours led us through the maze of souks took us to some sights and gave us some history all of which gave us time to aclimatise ourselves to the pace and atmosphere there and ask as many questions as we wanted in a relatively trusting context without the usual tourist pressure. On our last day the hotel also arranged for a horse-drawn cart ride for us which cut out some of the fraught negotiating that can sometimes take place when purchasing a service or item in the city.    We were particularly grateful that the hotel was able to lend us a room for an hour whilst we waited for transit to our next destination so that my mother and toddler could rest in peace.    La Maison Arabe is of course one of the higher end hotels in the medina charging accordingly (bear this in mind when eating at the restaurant). Nonetheless it’s worth noting that whilst some establishments charge these sorts of prices they can fail to deliver on service and you walk out feeling slightly done over. This is certainly not the case with La Maison Arabe.    The most important aspect of my stay there with my family was the people who work there. Every single member of staff from the porters to the waiters to the managers go out of their way to make you feel welcome to help you with every little matter. Nothing is too much trouble and they are extremely forthcoming with thoughtful suggestions and guidance on any matter. We found their customer service faultless sophisticated refined courteous and warm all at the same time. When we left there we missed them. Thank you Adil Morat Rachida and your female colleague who was at front desk whose name I do not recall and all the staff at La Maison Arabe for making our trip to Morrocco as beautiful as it was.,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/corinne_ranaraja

La Maison Arabe,ayr19 wrote a review Oct 2015,40,Brilliant staff,It's hard not to repeat what many others have said about this lovely Riad but here goes?  First is the staff who are the key element in making your stay so memorable they were very efficient and always had a word or kind smile for you. They seemed to know exactly what you required before you asked cannot praise them high enough.  We had a standard room which was perfectly adequate for our needsthe bed was very comfortable and had all the modern amenities required nowadays.  There was coffee machine in the roomhowever you can phone reception in the morning and get room service to bring it to your room. The only improvement l would recommend is that the lighting in the room and particularly the bathroom could be improved.    The ambience is fantastic and you will love all the corners to unwind after a hectic day of sightseeing.    The breakfast in the morning was the best we have had in any hotel we have stayed worldwide. The food is fresh imaginative and tasted great. You can have your eggs anyway you like and there is a lady who makes Moroccan bread fresh each morningplease try it you will love it.    We ate dinner in both the hotel restaurants and we were quite disappointed with our meals. The general manager Nabila Dakir arranged for a special meal to be provided for us unfortunately this was also not to our tastehowever we thank her for all her efforts.    Please try the country club after a day in the souks it is a haven of peace in a hectic but beautiful city.    Lastly hopefully you will get to meet Adil Chain who is the front office managerwho ln our opinian is the best in the business.

La Maison Arabe,clive w wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Faultless,The Maison Arabe redefines 5 star quality and service - so often these days a star rating is given to a hotel based on facilities rather than service this is definitely not the case with the Maison Arabe. From the moment we arrived we were greeted by our host Ishmael who escorted us to the open air Riad courtyard for a welcome drink whilst he took care of the 'check in' process after which we were given a tour of the hotel (much needed as the building has so much history and has evolved over many years into a quirky hotel with many different levels).    During our 4 night stay we wanted for nothing the hotel staff were all personable and no request was too much trouble. The Jazz bar was particularly notable with live music every evening and Rashid (A master of cocktails!) ever available to share his knowledge even to the extent of demonstrating how too make his own creation house cocktail and also writing down the recipe - We will definitely be enjoying this back at home whilst reminiscing on a perfect holiday.    Finally I would also recommend the cooking school where we spent a pleasant afternoon at the purpose built facility under the wonderful tutelage of Mohammed. A full hands on cooking experience with the added pleasure at the end of enjoying traditional Moroccan cuisine that we had prepared and cooked and would rival much of what Marrakech has to offer (although still not quite the quality of the Maison Arabe's two spectacular restaurants)    We will definitely be returning!,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Taunton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/79clivew

After spending two weeks of traveling the country what a great finish in a unique Moroccan style hotel in the middle of the city. Staying here is like staying in a luxury private home with family that is how the staff makes you feel. From the moment you arrive a friendly greeting and a welcome drink is your first experience. After a day of touring and shopping it is great to come back and head to the Jazz Bar for a drink and music with the most friendly waiters. No need to search every night for a restaurant  as your hotel has one of the best. The rooms are really comfortable and quiet as well.

Location is great - right when you enter Medina so it is accessible by car and you are not too deep in Medina's because it can get hectic with visitors and locals.  So much design detail was given to this hotel/riad so I got to experience a real Moroccan design.  Customer service as my review's title suggests was out of this world - it was superb.

La Maison Arabe,kitcatkitten wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Best service ever!,"My mum (61) and I (30) visited this delightful riad/hotel in October 2015 and thoroughly enjoyed our stay predominately due to the quality and friendliness of the service.    The location is very good being just a short stroll from the medina but in a quiet and pleasant area. The front desk staff are very willing to advise on places to eat activities to undertake customs to be aware of and to order taxis and to escort you to them as well as negotiating the fares.    Nothing was too much trouble for the team - particular ""wow what great service"" moments included providing us with chilled bottles of water for the journey home completing our departure forms for us and remembering what we liked to drink for breakfast.    One especially nice aspect of this hotel is the country club/kasbah a short drive away. The hotel provides a free hourly shuttle service to this total paradise where there is a pool with shaded loungers lovely lunch and drinks a cookery school and a little gift shop. For us this meant that we could enjoy the sights and attractions of the city whilst also taking time out for some sunbathing and relaxation a really distinctive offering!    The facilities and food were all good but really it's the friendly and accommodating service that makes this place. I would definitely go back and would definitely recommend it to anyone wishing to explore the exciting city of Morocco from a very friendly and welcoming base.

La Maison Arabe,LondonPhilC wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Absolutely perfect,It's difficult to know where to start with La Maison Arabe.    From the moment we arrived for a birthday surprise long weekend when we were unexpectedly upgraded to the royal suite (over three floors including a stunning sun terrace) the staff couldn't have done more to make our stay more enjoyable or memorable. Nothing seemed to be too much trouble.    As others have said the hotel is situated off a quiet side street in the Northern Medina but the unprepossessing exterior is hugely misleading. Made up of six roads pulled into one complex the hotel is beautifully and tastefully decorated and laid out.    There were so many highlights of our stay. Here are just a few:  - breakfast offered a fantastic range of local and international dishes. Served in the central court along the hotel pool and not least given the hustle and bustle outside it's an extraordinarily tranquil and relaxing setting;  - we took the opportunity to try the spa both enjoying an invigorating hamman. Service here too was superb;  - the 'country club' - reached by an hourly shuttle from the hotel - sits on the edge of the Medina. Once we'd visited it once it was difficult to tear ourselves away with its huge freshwater pool fantastic gardens and superb poolside service.    But the memory we will take away more than any other from our fantastic stay at La Maison Arabe was the level of service offered by its staff. We were greeted everywhere with friendly smiles and an incredible level of attentiveness in particular from the brilliant manager Adil whose efforts to meet our every wish bordered on the superhuman.    All of this comes at a price of course but for the experience it was a small consideration.,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LondonPhilC

La Maison Arabe,Brian M wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Excellent Riad in the Medina,This hotel lives up to the reviews. One of the best services we have had in a hotel.    Pros:  - Top service from every single member of staff  - Close to the main attractions in the Medina  - Offsite pool is relaxing and quiet  - Breakfast outstanding  - Room very comfortable  - Good wifi    Cons:  - The room was a little dark  - No tea making facilities    On checking in we were introduced to a member of staff that was taking care of us for the checkin process. We were taken straight to the bar area where we could relax and drink our welcome drinks while we waited for our room. When we were ready we were given a tour of the Riad before being shown our room which they had upgraded for us free of charge!    The room was large lovely bed and air conditioning that worked really well. Wifi was good as each room had a router although one minor point was that it was a little dark in places at night and the TV could have more english channels.    Breakfast was very good with their own bakery making the best tasting pastries we've had! The setting was beautiful by the pool with not many tables so the service should be good. They have a traditional Berber woman serving traditional baked breads right in front of you and a good selection of hot plates as well as cold meats and fruit. The staff was impeccable in their service from welcoming you to your table to offering to take an egg order back to your table. Couldn't think of a better way to start a day.    The Riad has a pool but it's not really private as the restaurant surrounds it. To address this they have an offsite pool which is about 10-15 mins drive away via their free private shuttle bus. This was nice and relaxing and for us was very quiet as there were only 2 other people there! The staff there was also a pleasure to speak to.    The evening restaurant was also in the same setting and it was beautiful. A bit pricey but the food was very good and as always service outstanding.    The Riad also provided free tea in the afternoon in their tea room which was a nice touch.    The Riad is close to the Djemaa El-Fna and souks which is around a 10 minute walk away. For a calmer walk we suggest you walk right from the hotel to the larger main road which have bigger and better pavements than going through the smaller roads with the shops on either side as it gets pretty busy with the small pavements.    Checking out was smooth and we even received the immigration exit cards filled in for us! Before checking out we emailed our next hotel to pick us up with their taxi. After some time while waiting for the taxi in reception we were given free bottled water by the porter. After 30 mins the receptionist offered to call the hotel and to enquire where our taxi was. He found out the hotel gave me the wrong hotel contact number and he proceeded with finding the correct one and proceeded with chasing up where our taxi was.

La Maison Arabe,LALAlyla wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Best Customer Service Ever! Gorgeous Boutique Hotel.,The moment we arrived we were greeted by charming Ishmael brought to the lovely garden patio and given a refreshing beverage. After a brief tour of the facilities we were taken to our beautiful patio-side room. Tons of windows and a private large balcony with couch were high points but the Moroccan details and luxury of the room made it superb.    This hotel is small but has the amenities of a much larger hotel. Breakfast either the extensive and delightful poolside buffet or room service is the best I had in Morocco. Special note: even though our flight out was hours before breakfast is usually served we received a tray to our room at 4:15 with everything we ordered the night before. Our driver was prompt and delivered us to the airport with perfect timing.    The cooking class at the offsite facilities was a real treat. I recommend planning to swim before or after the class and making a day of it. The shuttle back in the evening will come for you later than the posted 1800 time if you do the afternoon session (usually fewer participants). Leave space in your bag for a fairly large tagine (the same one used in the class) or you will be forced to leave it behind. The gardens and small gift shop are well worth a visit.    To be clear I love spa treatments. The spa here is gorgeous and my hammam treatment was fabulous. They have several options and I recommend extending the massage to an hour at least! I also regret not getting a facial. If it was even half as good as the treatment I received it would have been worth it. And the eucalyptus in their black soap was so refreshing.    The restaurants are exceptional. The poolside option has two menus and the risotto is the best I've ever eaten. The traditional option setting is very romantic and intimate. Reservations at peak times is recommended. The jazz bar is the perfect sumptuous and cozy retreat. Rashid mixes up refreshing Moroccan inspired cocktails. Ask what he is mixing before placing your order!    We requested a tour guide for our visit to the medina and had a great experience with him. Invest at least 3 hours for this there is really no way to opt out earlier. Too much to see! Also be aware that many of the educational opportunities you will be offered will become hard sell moments before you leave. Be sure to speak with your guide as to what you are looking for and what you do not want. I ended up buying a rug! I didn't intend to leave with such a large purchase but I'm certain I will eventually be grateful I did. Also be sure to ask the guide whether the shop you are entering is open to negotiation. It can be difficult to tell sometimes.    This hotel is beyond compare.

Maison Arabe does authentic Moroccan cooking in a classical presentation to delicious effect. To start we shared a mini pastilla trio (three varieties each with a delicate flaky crust—wonderful) and traditional Moroccan salad of some 10-12 small salads including spiced carrots fragrant and tender aubergine a lively beet medley quinoa with tomatoes and cucumber to name only several. I had bites of my dinner companion's dish—a roasted lamb shoulder which was impossibly tender and delicious and I had a beef tagine with dates figs and apricots. So so good.

The outdoor restaurant surrounding the pool is extremely picturesque and romantic in the evenings with lovely lanterns candles and live musicians etc. The food is of a high standard especially from the Moroccan menu but maybe a touch 'bland' to cater for all tastes. I requested extra spicing which they happily obliged transforming good dishes to excellent! The Moroccan wine was a complete revelation good value and highly recommended. The charming Jazz bar cocktail lounge has bags of character serves great cocktails and the head barman really makes you feel welcome providing exceptional service. The additional 'country club' with a larger pool surrounded by gorgeous fruit and olive trees and lovely gardens is just heavenly -a perfect retreat to just relax and enjoy the wonderful weather! The 'Cookery Workshop' arranged post-arrival was enjoyable and great fun although again to cater for all they have a tendency towards assuming you've little knowledge and maybe make it a little too easy.

At Breakfast we had a wide range of juices (grapefruit cucumber beetroot carrot orange lemon) cakes breads croissants etc. with cheese and meat as usual. We could also order a Moroccan pancake to be made or scrambled or boiled egg on request. One hint - check that the boiled egg is actually being made - once we had to wait 20 minutes for a 5 minute egg! They had simply forgotten!  There are two parts to the hotel - the older and the new. We were in the newer part but both parts are equally good - but it is quite a maze to find one from the other. We got lost twice!

La Maison Arabe,Shocking wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Six Star Staff,Have just returned from 4 nights at this fabulous read. A wonderful place to stay to really experience Moroccan hospitality. Amazing rooms and good food but the staff is what particularly makes this an excellent place to stay. Thank you particularly to Rasheed always greeting us with a smile and one of his delicious concoctions from his jazz bar. We also particularly enjoyed the country club. A little oasis away from the hustle and bustle of the souk and medina. The gardens are beautiful they grown their own aubergines chilli peppers herbs pomegranates and much more. I didn't take part in the cookery school as was enjoying the sunshine too much after a disappointing summer here but I will next time. My only negative would be to avoid room 214 as although it looks charming it has very narrow steps up to the bathroom which were a little tricky to navigate in the middle of the night. We were fortunate enough to be moved to 210 which is a suite with its own courtyard. A really lovely room. Other plus points: the transports worked well we were given water to take to the airport with us on our departure and it is within walking distance of the souk and main square.,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bray on Thames, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shocking

Moroccan cuisine not really special.  Somehow could almost be a themed-luxurious hotel in another country. Maybe a little too polished in my opinion...

La Maison Arabe,Emamul H wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Simply Beautiful!!!,Well what can I say? From the moment we arrived at La Maison Arabe for our 1st wedding anniversary it has been a first class experience. Initially I emailed the hotel from London to which they replied immediately arranging our transfers. Upon reaching Marrakech the driver was already waiting. We were brought to the hotel in a AC mini van something you'll appreciate once witnessing the heat! We were welcomed by the Manager at the front desk - Adil Chaif. He checked us in early as we arrived before 3pm and gave us some refreshing mint tea and moroccan savouries. Amazing!! Adil explained the details of the hotel and showed us our room giving us a tour of the hotel.    The hotel itself is in an ideal location. It's a 10 min walk to Jami-Fina main square 15 mins to Souks. Also it's 20 min walk to Jardin Marjorelle.    All the staff at La Maison Arabe are wonderful very polite always smiling and helpful. Words can't do justice. The restaurant is a must and the breakfast buffet is amazing.    The Hammam at the hotel is one of the best I've experienced anywhere in the world. The lady at the Hammam welcomed us with mint tea and savouries gave us choices of which oil we like. Massage was beautiful. We felt very much at home. Truly amazing experience.    Adil was very helpful in providing us with maps of Marrakech. He recommended top restaurants mapped out our route to landmarks and souks. Without it we'd have got lost! We thank him so much!    Adil and Raja were very swift and helpful in arranging our coach trip to Agadir. They bought the tickets for us and arranged taxi to the station. We didn't need to do a thing.    The cooking class is a must! It was a wonderful experience and the Dada Amina and the translating man made it a wonderful experience.    The carriage horse is a wonderful experience. You are whizzed around amongst busy cars and motorbikes across landmarks. Do haggle a price though. 200dhs should settle it.    My wife wasn't sure about the experience we might have in a Riad Hotel but she's now left in amazement. Our anniversary has been made even more wonderful by La Maison Arabe and their staff. If we ever return to Marrakech then La Maison Arabe is the ONLY place we'll stay. I couldn't recommend it enough. Thank you guys and God Bless.,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/314emamulh

La Maison Arabe,Bernard G wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Even better as a Hotel,"Having written a review for the restaurant and being very impressed with the food I decided to spend my last night in Kech here.    I made a last minute booking in person and a Standard Room was not available .  I was upgraded to a Suite for a very modest additional price.    The room although a little small is actually really pleasant.  On arrival I was given a non alcoholic cocktail and then given a tour of the hotel.  This was useful as the hotel son many levels with many corridors. To my mind this all adds to the charm.  The decor is traditional Marrakech / Morocco and beautifully executed.  The hotel is in an excellent location between the Medina / Souks and the ""new town"" (Gueliz). Everything is in walking distance.  The photographs do justice to the hotel.    The rooms have international TV (Mainly French) and the hotel has good internet widely available throughout the hotel.    La Maison Arabe is down a small alleyway and nowhere near as difficult to find as some of the Riads in the Medina.    This hotel genuinely deserves 5 stars and would be prefect for a short break in Kech.    If in doubt try for dinner first and then regret not staying!!!!!",Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Marrakech, Morocco",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BernardGarrett

A tour of the hotel and its facilities followed a delicious welcoming and refreshing drink of mint ginger pineapple juice and limes blended with crushed ice. Our suite was beautifully decorated and everything to make you comfortable was provided. We enjoyed a number of excellent meals in the outdoor restaurant located around the pool and the live music provided by the resident guitarist. Service was exceptional and we found ourselves not wanting to leave!

La Maison Arabe,BaronessM wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Fabulous Hotel,This boutique hotel is a fantastic place to stay. The high level of professionalism of every staff member makes it special and I was so sad to leave. Having lived in Morocco in the past I can truly rate the quality of their spa. Do not miss the opportunity to have a terrific experience and book a Hammam during your stay as not only the place is gorgeous the therapists really know what they are doing. I was also very impressed with the staff during breakfast. Specially a gentleman called Mohamed which I believe has been there since the opening. One great advantage of La Maison Arabe is that it was there way before the fashion started. Therefore they have highly knowledgeable management beautifully orchestrated by the charming Madame Nabila. She knows everything and everybody in town and will become the perfect hostess whether you are a single traveller or have a complex special occasion to organise. She is a truly old school hotelier and her attention to detail is noticed in the way the hotel is run. Would also like to mention Mustafa Nabila's assistant as well as Adil and his front office team. They sorted all my needs with immense friendliness and efficiency. I can't wait to go back.,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled solo,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BaronessM

La Maison Arabe,BronzenEmpress wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Excellent Hospitality,STAFF  the staff were hospitable; very accommodating attentive and kind    FOOD  the food was excellent- even if you do not stay in this hotel I would recommend eating here at least once.    The menu is written in English and French    ROOMS  beds were comfortable  Bathroom was huge and room was well kept.    My only gripe was that coming from the U.S. we needed travel converters to charge our electronics.    I would have liked for them to have electric sockets next to the bed because we had to keep getting up to rotate devices for charging.    Another thing that I didn't like- one key per room. So it was horrible having to coordinate between the two of us when we did separate things or having to get up and lock the door and open the door for the other person because you had to manually lock the door and open the door for the other person of you wanted to stay on the room.    GROUNDS  The grounds were kept and maintained. Staying here will give you the traditional feel of Moroccan homes.    Beautiful architecture and decor- traditional.    You also must visit the off the grounds pool- BEAUTIFUL! They have a cooking class that is held here and the food is delicious.    DISABILITIES  While I still give this hotel 5 stars I would say it is not wheel cochair accessible. If you or the person you are traveling with are not able to climb stairs then this is not the hotel for you. No one in our party had disabilities so we were fine. But if you do then you will find this beautiful place a challenge.,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BronzenEmpress
La Maison Arabe,jsmalnor wrote a review Sep 2015,50,La Maison Arabe is one of the best,The first and possibly best Ryad in Marrakech. All the beautiful detail of a historic Moroccan home combined with attentive and friendly staff who make you feel the Four Seasons had something to do with their training. Excellent experience throughout our brief stay including amazing food tea and a drink they invented called a Morojito! Highly Highly recommend. We went for our 30th anniversary and it was fantastic. Also just a 10 minute walk to the square and the large Souk of Marrakech. Fantastic! We weren't able to take advantage of their offsite pool / garden but it looks like a great respite after traveling across the desert or escaping the heat after a long day walking the city.,Date of stay: September 2015,,"Grand Rapids, Michigan",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jsmalnor
La Maison Arabe,1SCB wrote a review Sep 2015,40,4.5 stars even with the cons,Excellent hospitality!!! In this bouquet hotel allowing my rating to be 4.5 stars. However there is room for improvement.  1. Only one key is giving per room which makes no sense when the key is needed to lock the room door when your inside and when you leave. NOT TO MENTION A FIRE HAZARD... their way of fixing this issue is to send house keeping to open your door if someone in ur party is left/locked in the room for any reason. beware if you leave you key in the door house keeping won't be able to open it. Simple solution provide 2 keys.  2. breakfast/dinner was good but menu was the same everyday which may be an issue for some travelers  3. Wifi service was great however requires you to login every time you change location in hotel not a problem for myself but might be for others.  4. No iron or iron-board in my room however others who traveled with me states their room did have one.  5.No ice station in hotel at all you will have to call room service or front desk to get ice  6. TV only has news station n one movie channel thats spoken in arabic. I am not one to watch TV on vacation however the option is always great.  7. Lastly the shower head needs to be removed in order to wash off not a stand under shower also be careful with partial shower door it is not fixed to tub allowing for serious injuries if ur not careful.    Overall all the hotel was great as well as the top notch service thats why i give a 4.5 stars but if ur looking for a more modern feel of Morocco Stay in the newtown at hotels instead of a riad...,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,nyc,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1SCB

La Maison Arabe,C S wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Did not want to go home,Having spent three days in the desert and at the end of a 12-hour drive back to Marrakech we arrived at La Maison Arabe at 10pm tired dirty and very much looking forward to a bit of luxury. We had high expectations having read all the rave reviews.    We were welcomed and taken to the Jazz Bar for a cooling drink before being given a tour of the hotel and shown to our room. We had booked a standard room but were upgraded to room 247 a beautifully appointed room with a balcony overlooking the pool and a huge gorgeous bathroom with corner bath. Complimentary water and a bottle of wine helped to make us feel spoiled right away.    We asked if it was too late to dine in the hotel restaurant and were assured that would be fine so after a quick freshen up we headed down to the pool area and were seated at a lovely table. We knew the restaurant had an excellent reputation so decided to push the boat out and order three courses. The chicken bastilla was excellent as was the cabernet suggested by the waiter. The monkfish tagine was also outstanding. Unfortunately my medium-rare steak arrived medium well. We aren't the sort to complain or send food back as a rule but this was not a cheap meal and we were exhausted and had high expectations based on everything we had read so we asked for the steak to be re-cooked. In the 15 minutes I waited for the replacement steak my partner had finished his tagine. I eagerly cut into the second steak to find it raw in the middle. By this point we were both disappointed and I had lost my appetite and didn't care to wait for a third time. We were offered desert on the house which we declined. Eventually the manager appeared to apologise and offered desert again. By now I just wanted to go to bed. He did reappear a few minutes later to say that we would not be charged for the meal nor the wine which was an appreciated gesture and went some way to softening the disappointment.    Next morning we arrived for breakfast happy to start over again and we weren't disappointed. Fabulous spread stunning surroundings and excellent service start to finish.    Front desk staff were very accommodating and friendly (we stopped to chat a few times and found everyone to be engaging helpful and good for a laugh) throughout our stay and every request (whether for a map a charger cable for my camera or forgotten toiletries) was met with a smile and prompt fulfilment.    Location was ideal for us. We walked to the Jardin Marjorelle through the souks and it's an easy walk to the main square. If you use taxis you don't need to navigate a maze of alleyways so the likelihood of getting lost is reduced.    We loved the country club. We even had it to ourselves for a couple of hours one morning. It seems to get busier in the afternoon. Wifi was excellent. We enjoyed the cold white wine and beer but would have loved to have been able to order a cocktail.    The cookery class was fantastic with a superb atmosphere and knowledgable staff. We really enjoyed the morning and ended up purchasing the hotel's cookbook to take even more recipes home.    We also made use of the beautiful hammam on site. I had the Imperial Package which was very good value and all our treatments were of a very high standard. The spa itself is beautiful and so relaxing I nearly fell asleep at one stage.    My spa package included lunch which we took next to the pool just before leaving for the airport. I ordered the steak and frites from the lunch menu still hoping I might get a decent steak during our stay. Imagine my surprise when the waiter brought out the steak from the dinner menu I had ordered two nights earlier with such a disappointing outcome. Everyone - me my partner the waiter and the chef - paused with trepidation while I cut into the steak. I am delighted to report that not only was the steak cooked perfectly but the whole plate was one of the finest meals I have ever eaten. To top off a perfect meal the wonderful bartender who had stayed late two nights in order to fix us a nightcap when we returned from dinner out and who by now knew I was very much a fan of his mojitos brought us two on the house. Truly a perfect end to an incredibly luxurious stay.    So many other touches I haven't described made this one of our best hotel experiences ever. We truly felt special and pampered but in a way that never felt stuffy or pretentious. We hated to leave and I felt we were saying goodbye to friends. Thank you so much to all the staff who made our three days here so special. We've had a very tough year and it was just what we needed.,Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Devon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarrieInDevon

La Maison Arabe,Hamish A wrote a review Aug 2015,50,A truly exceptional hotel,We ve just arrived back from a fantastic short break at the hotel. The only thing that lets the place down is the website as we really weren't prepared for the quality of the surroundings and level of service that was provided. On arriving we were told that there was a surprise in the room only to be lead to the master suite instead of the room we requested as a free upgrade. Nothing was too much hassle for the staff who were attentive and most accommodating throughout our stay and the use of the country club was phenomenal which again I don't think was sold enough on the website. The hotel is within walking distance to the souks and if you don't fancy a brisk stroll the hotel will organise taxis for you at short notice.  I.d like to thank all the staff there for a fantastic weekend and going the extra mile where it wasn't needed.,Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hamisha_11

We had dinner at the restaurant and they presented her with a cake and sang for her and she loved it! The food was fantastic the flavours lovely!  The manager Adil couldn't do enough for us and as were all the staff we were treated like royalty throughout our stay.

To qualify the above title of this review it is probably worth contextualising that I have through my occupation had the chance to regularly stay in some of the best hotels on all continents. I would say that the Maison is possibly my favourite of them all. My barometer requires cultural character great food and above all else personal service and this ticks the box on all fronts. The staff are respectful knowledgable and attentive. They love their hotel and their employer and this resonates through the work they do. From Rashid the expert cocktail supremo through to the restaurant manager cleaners and hammam this place is a gem. The food is the best I have tasted in Morocco. Like many others have already said... If I could go back and lower my opinion of other hotels just to create the division this hotel deserves then I would. Let's just call it 5**. Oh and do a cookery course with them ... It's incredible.

La Maison Arabe,Jayma C wrote a review Aug 2015,50,Exquisite Accomodations paired with the Perfect Staff!,I traveled to Marrakech for a summer adventure with my boyfriend. From the moment we arrived we were impressed by the authenticity of the decor and the friendliness of the decor. Before we arrived we booked a taxi with the hotel and our driver Abdel met us promptly with a smile and made sure we knew that we were welcome in Marrakesh.  When we got to the hotel our bags were brought inside and they asked for our passports so that they could check us in while we enjoyed a refreshment in the Jazz bar. When we were finished with our drink one of the receptionists gave us a tour of the hotel giving us background on the hotels history before ushering us to our room where our bags had already been placed. They offered us a personalized welcome letter along with a bottle of local wine in the room which was a delicious Shiraz :)  Our first night we stayed at the hotel and ate at the restaurant having no idea how much we would end up craving it for the rest of our trip! I ordered the beef tajine with caramelized onions an tomatoes....AMAZING! The beef just fell apart and the sauce paired with the onions was so sweet and better than anything I could've expected. The ambiance of the restaurant only made the dining experience better; Two men playing guitar across the pool candles lighting the area and servers that were prompt but never overbearing.  We went to the country club the next morning on one of the free hourly shuttles and we were blown away by the service offered by Mohammed. When we first arrived we were given a tour of the huge gardens and shown the rest of the property. The star of this club is of course the pool. A large infinity pool surrounded by four over-sized cabanas and plenty of tanning loungers and umbrellas. A table sat on the side with extra towels and cute straw hats that guests could use throughout the day. Mohammed would bring our towels to where we decided to sit brought a complimentary drink upon arrival gave us a menu with the WIFI code on it and made himself available throughout the whole day. At the end of the day when we were about to leave he would bring us sliced watermelon and a cold towel for our faces along with the bill. All of this EVERYDAY and without ever having to ask. Mohammed has mastered the art of anticipating and satisfying guest needs some of which we didn't even realized we wanted until they were presented.  Our first room 248 was an upgraded suite (which we were automatically upgraded to due to low season) had a view of the pool and restaurant a large enough bedroom and wonderful bathroom en-suite. We ended up having to move rooms halfway through the stay because a large storm blew through Marrakesh( which is rare and we saw damage to numerous houses) and a portion of our bathroom was flooded a bit and you could see some water in the walls. Nothing of ours was damaged but I wanted them to be aware of what had happened so I called the front desk and they immediately came up and assessed the damage. They upgraded us again and moved us to a room 213 all I can say is Wow. A huge porch that looked down into the courtyard a large bathtub with marble on the floors and all of the walls. They even offered us to have a free meal from the restaurant but we declined a little embarrassed that such a little issue had turned into such a great thing for us. Nonetheless after we were settled in our room Rachid brought us a glass of champagne each and confirmed that we were happy with the room.  Rachid is another employee that I must mention in my review he was such a pleasure! He taught us some Arabic phrases brought us refreshments up to our room just because he saw us coming back from the pool and looked like we needed a drink stayed open late so that we could wind down in the jazz bar after a crazy day in the city and was just an overall great addition to our stay.  The location of this hotel is perfect. Its right in the Medina and in walking distance of everything! The souks jemma al fna Khoutoubia mosque and all other neighborhoods are a short distance as long as you can find your way. NOTE: If you get frustrated or uncomfortable at the souks (people are very aggressive when it comes to wanting you to buy something) we found a place only a 5 minute walk from the hotel called the Artisinal Ensemble with fixed prices and much more calm atmosphere. Yes prices are a little higher but your paying for the convenience and serenity that's what mattered most for us.  Our last day we had a late flight and asked if we were still allowed to use the pool before returning to take the hotel provided taxi to the airport and the one upped our request!. For the whole we were given the privilege of using the huge pool house with rooftop spa and the most beautiful decorations I have ever seen! We tanned ate lunch and showered in the insanely beautiful bathroom before we had to leave for the airport. It was THE BEST way to end a vacation that we will never forget. When we ever return to Marrakesh we have no doubts that we will stay at this wonderful hotel I cant think of one thing I could possibly criticize. Any of my friends that will be going to Marrakesh will have my highest recommendations which goes a long way considering I am currently finishing my degree in hospitality management and have worked in hotels for years.

La Maison Arabe,93alexander83 wrote a review Aug 2015,50,Perfect Marrakech Experience!,From the start we dived into a genuine warm and authentic atmosphere at the hotel. The staff is very friendly and helpful at all times. The rooms: Very clean nicely styled in marrocan design large rooms comfortable bed perfect WiFi - nothing to argue at all. The whole hotel is a journey to discover from the jazz bar the various rooms the tea patio the restaurant / pool area and the spa. Within the spa I enjoyed a very professional Hammam and Massage for a reasonable price. The food in the restaurant was of higher price but of even higher class - marrocan and international cuisine both very fine! The Country Club: Very clean fantastic service nice pool beautiful garden and not to forget the cooking class - awesome cooking a tajine for yourself! The location of the hotel is very good: Close to almost everything you want to see. And upon request you get a very skilled guide from the hotel (no bargaining!) to see the old part of Marrakech. Bottom line: One of the best hotels ever experienced in terms of friendliness authentic interior and staff.

La Maison Arabe,Herlin83 wrote a review Aug 2015,50,Perfect in every detail! Will definitely be back!,My fiancée and I went to Marrakesh to celebrate our nine year anniversary and we could not have chosen a better hotel for our stay. I had visited this town once before and had somewhat of a bad experience whitch meant that the hotel we would chose to stay at this time needed to be absolutely perfect. And we were not disappointed! The service is impeccable from the wonderful reception to the brekfast staff.  Our room was beautiful we were upgraded and stayed in room 246 that has a lovely view over the courtyard pool and a large balcony where we enjoyed the complimentary afternoon tea after a busy day of touring Marrakech. The location of Maison Arabe is great walking distance to the souks and Djemaa el fna as well as the Khoutobia mosque. The hotel has a country club where only hotel guests are allowed its amazing. A large pool in a tranquile garden with a really good lunch restaurant. The service at the countryclub was just as exceptional as it was back at the hotel. Our poolman in charge was exceptional.  We didn't try the hammam but the cooking class was a blast I am now a proud owner of my very own Tajine pot (you get one after finishing the class) and I can't wait to try it out at home as well. Speaking of food: The food at the hotel will blow your mind it is delicious! Try the crepes with nutella for breakfast and the llamb tajine with caramellised tomatoes for dinner. Yummie! As you can tell I don't have single negative thing to say about this hotel. Choose this if you want a five star hotel experience but with the charm and personal touch that you would get in a small ryad. We will be back for sure!    Tips: Close to La Maison Arabe is a market just like the souks at djemaa el fna called Artisanall but smaller with fixed prices. We did our shopping there since the real square is quite an intense experience and we didnt have the energy to go back and barter.  Also make sure you try the bar at La Maison Arabe lots of really good drinks and a great bartender (Rashid) who is really funny and goes the extra mile. He helped my fiancee when he had a back ache came up to our room with a home made remedie that worked like a charm.    //Room 246 from Sweden,Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Stockholm, Sweden",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Herlin83
La Maison Arabe,DrDelR wrote a review Aug 2015,50,Every aspect was perfect!,I can only sing raves about our stay at la maison arabe. At our arrival the front desk and bell staff were efficient courteous and genuinely warm in their greeting and throughout our stay. The room was appointed spectacularly and in a style which made one feel at home yet also like Moroccan royalty. The food and service in the restaurants was superior. Wifi was excellent -- with each room having their own router. If you are searching for a hotel which truly makes you feel as if you are family albeit one with a palatial accommodation then I strongly recommend you choose la maison arabe.

La Maison Arabe,CastorAndPollux wrote a review Aug 2015,50,A first taste of Morocco,Having spent the evening in the busy souks of Morocco La Maison Arabe was a blissful oasis. Whilst the hotel had an authentic feel the restaurant was the reason we came.  Situated in an inner courtyard the restaurant is set up around the pool with a superb ambiance. The staff are attentive but not overbearing and the facilities are welcome following the heat and dust of the city. The food is the main attraction and although we only had one course that was plenty; the portions are very generous. This suited us and all five of us (including a nine year old) were delighted with our respective meals. I highly recommend the lamb. Prices are also very good and it made for a superb evening out in Morocco.,Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CastorAndPollux
La Maison Arabe,Profguy wrote a review Aug 2015,50,Best Hotel in Morocco,There is a reason this hotel is consistently ranked #1. After a few hours it is obvious why Winston Churchill loved this place. There are no flaws. The moment we arrived in they led us to the Jazz bar offered us a Mohito (sans alcohol on our part) a wet towel some nice AC and checked us in right there. They took our bags to the room and gave us a grand tour. The facility is a maze as it has been retrofitted and expanded over the years. There is a “new” section and “old.”    Since we arrived a day early our suite was not ready the first night so we stayed in a Junior Suite the first night (old section) overlooking the pool and restaurant. The room was nice and cold despite 104 degree outside the linens perfect the bathroom large spacious closet sitting area and balcony. After one night we were tempted to stay in this room thinking “it cannot get better.” It got better.    The Noor suite was our home for the next two nights and is fit for a king. Bedroom living room toilet room huge shower / tub room leather clad walk-in closet hand carved hallway and a private courtyard with sunny and shaded areas. PLEASE DON’T MAKE ME LEAVE! The room was immaculate and only surpassed by the service.    We asked for tea it showed up instantly. We needed a gift wrapped for travel they picked it up had it done. My SIM card needed recharging and a new sim card showed up within minutes. I asked for the room to be cold and it was an ice box quickly. We wanted a recommendation for places to eat and spas…each done perfectly. I love this staff.    The coolest touch was EVERY ROOM has its own wifi router. This was as fast as back home. It may seem odd to mention but this was real luxury given the lack of internet speed in the Morocco.    They arranged for a cooking class for my daughter and gave us a private room to eat in with our own wait staff. The restaurant surrounds the pool and is very intimate. The spa is great and the private hammam was a unique life experience. They were constantly cleaning the carpets floors rooms etc. The bellman did anything you asked and I wish I could take the staff with me. They are the best staff I have ever encountered. We should have stayed there longer.,Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Indianapolis, Indiana",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Profguy
La Maison Arabe,ButlertheDog wrote a review Aug 2015,50,INCREDIBLE!,I wish that I could go back and lower the score on every hotel I have ever rated on Trip Advisor in order to give La Maison Arabe the separation between really good and OUTSTANDING Hotels. This was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at and found it better than home while in Marrakech.  Unfortunately our entire family arrived from Fez suffering from an 18 hour stomach / diarrhea issue. During check-in we were offered a refreshing Lime drink from the bar tender Rachid. When told we were sick he showed up in our room 20 minutes later with white rice and a special Moroccan Tea designed to calm the stomach. At that moment I had Aspirin Tums Pepto Imodium and Cipro (dear God get this prescription before you go on the trip as you or a family member will need it) so I figured this drink will either bring on the cure or hurry up the death. It was a Tea with about a Tablespoon of Cumin Honey Ginger and who knows what else. 12 hours later I was better so I offer my thanks to western medicine and the ancient Berber Tea from Rachid.  Rooms were OUTSTANDING (we had 211 and 212) and extremely well appointed. Great Breakfast included each morning and we had dinner at the restaurant and in the bar with Rachid – who continued to make great drinks and give OUTSTANDING SERVICE. The bar has an old time Jazz theme and there was a guy playing the piano and guitar in the background.  Front Desk help was great. We bought a lamp and when it was delivered it was supposed to be wired for US Power. It was not and the hotel called the Lamp Maker and worked with us to get it resolved.  We did go in the small pool on-site for a nice cooling off after a hot day.  My wife and older daughter did the Hamman (Body Scrub and Massage) and my younger daughter got a Henna Tattoo. The Hamman was one of the highlights for my wife and the Spa on-site was amazing!  I would highly recommend the ‘Cookery School” which is located at the off-site Country Club. Great History of Morocco the foods each culture brought and how they are cooked. There is an in ground oven outdoor bread oven (looks like a pizza oven) and then we went in and made two salads and a Tagine along with desert. Received Diplomas and a FREE Tagine. There were an additional 10 people in the class and we all enjoyed our lunches when completed.  One Note: The Cookery School is at the off-site country club so you might want to bring a change of clothes to go swimming or enjoy the location as you are already there.  Hotel is convenient to a Pharmacy ATM and is about a 5 to 10 minute safe walk to the large square.,Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Clemmons, North Carolina",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ButlertheDog
La Maison Arabe,wolfmomlesley wrote a review Aug 2015,50,"Very nice staff, very helpful",We stayed at this hotel for 4 days and have no complaints. It was beautiful from the rugs in the room the many many windows beautiful tiles breakfast sitting area with the pool view to the jazz bar.    The staff were always near by to answer any questions and were very nice.    They clean the rooms in the morning and at night before we would return they would close all the windows and blinds and turn on the AC for us so when we arrived it was nice and cold.    There were hand made crepes and the likes for breakfast made by a women in the traditional way. There was smoked fish cheese wonderful interesting fruit juices: cucumber mint beat carrots and apple etc. There were pastries fruit cereal bread coffee and tea.    The wifi was great all over the hotel was a strong connection.    I would advise getting to the airport 3 hours early. All sorts of horrible experiences posted all over the Internet about the airport !!    We got here 3 hours early and intended on going to the lounge with the priority pass... but just last month they stopped accepting it. So we will just wait in a cafe.

La Maison Arabe,jojohollo wrote a review Jul 2015,50,"Absolutely brilliant service, gorgeous hotel!",This hotel is amazing - such fantastic service from start to finish a gorgeous hotel fantastic room (so beautiful) and five star restaurant. We only stayed here a night at the end of our trip and wished we could have stayed longer. Upon arrival we were shown around the hotel and given a free juice cocktail while waiting for our room (we were a little early for check in). We then were shown to our room which they were able to get ready early and it was really stunning - beautifully decorated big in size and some really beautiful features. After a short shuttle ride we arrived at the pool - an oasis in the 45 degree heat of Marrakech. Again we received a free juice cocktail towels to use and even a straw hat! We went to the restaurant for dinner and it was absolutely incredible - great food great wine and impeccable service. After dinner we went for a cocktail in the jazz bar where there was a live jazz pianist and once again excellent service. Breakfast in the morning was also fab. To top it off when we had left the hotel and got out of our taxi at the airport we were greeted once again by a member of staff on his scooter. Slightly puzzled at first I then realised he was holding my silver ring (that I'd just bought at the medina in Essaouira!) that I must have left in the bathroom. He'd ridden on his scooter in hot pursuit of our cab just to return it to me!

La Maison Arabe,AustraliaFeliz wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Diamond in the rough,The hotel is right in the old medina down a side alley which at first I was unsure of however once the doorman opens the front door and we smelt the waft of cinnamon and the welcoming smiles of the 'oh so helpful' staff we knew we had choose the right place to spend 4 nights. The rooms (we had 3) were all wonderful. Very large rooms big bathroom. Our shower was quite weak however the others said theirs was fine so it was just the luck of the draw I suppose. On arrival we where ushered into one of the lounge areas and given a local refreshing drink and snack before being shown to our room. We ate in the restuarant twice and it certainly lived up to it reputation. The jazz bar was a fabulous place to enjoy a quiet drink after a long day of touring. And the breakfast served each morning around the pool was a treat.

La Maison Arabe,rpfranger wrote a review Jul 2015,50,The best hotel with the most courteous staff we've stayed so far,In summary we can highly recommend La Maison Arabe. The furnishings are beautiful the architecture is impressive and the amenities (including its own country club) luxurious. However what made our stay so remarkable was the best staff we have ever met in our global travels so far. We will definitely go back to La Maison Arabe!    For those interested in details:     STAFF:  ALL of them were very helpful and in fact we have never met so friendly staff in all our travels so far: all of them had a charisma that sowed the perfect combination of courtesy respect and fun! They have read 99% of our desires from our eyes and what is even more important (because NOBODY can read 100%): they made us feeling so comfortable that we never felt ashamed to ask for the remaining 1% favors (which they then fulfilled with a smile on their face).  Their courtesy and versatility was shown in specific when my girlfriend caught a bad indigestion (no not from La Maison's food as we ate somewhere else the day before). They ordered a doctor and afterwards sent the bellboy to organize the prescribed medicine (at 10PM during Ramadan!). They gave tea soup couscous and everything that helped her to get well again (without any additional costs!!) and what was really impressive is how heartily everyone of them cared.    Another wonderful example was the last day: I forgot a jacket in the closet (stupid me). Frankly I wouldn't have realized that before being at home. Thankfully their staff's minds are much sharper than mine while on vacation. When already waiting at the gate for the plane my name was paged because the driver and the bellboy drove to the airport again waiting at the security check with a smile on their face and my jacket in their hands.     RECEPTION DESK:  They gave very valuable advice for restaurants sights to visit and many other good insights and organized drivers or guides even on very short notice.   They were also excited to learn about our experiences in other restaruants or tours we did which - I guess - is the key why their recommendations are of such a high quality.    ROOMS:  The rooms are beautifully designed and ours was located above the pool (we could hear the music in the evening and - other than chronical complaining writers of negative reviews - we really liked that!)  What we also really appreciated was that the rooms were made multiple times a day but not once were we disturbed by the cleaning staff - which requires a good internal communication among the hotel staff with such an irregular and spontaneous schedule that we had.     FOOD:  The breakfast was very substantial and had a nice combination of local specialties enhanced with parts of intercontinental breakfasts. For example they had at least 6 different fresh juices homemade (moroccon) bread pastries and yogurt fresh fruits and many many other things. The coffee as well as the service during breakfast was just excellent.  The in-house restaurant serves both moroccon and international dishes and we have eaten dinner there 4 times and tried out many different dishes. Not only have the local dishes topped other restaurants we've visited while in Morocco but also the international meals were among the best of all restaurants in other countries we have been so far. All the ingredients were fresh and of very high quality (the best tenderloin I had so far literally melted in my mouth) and the preparation was just top-notch!     COUNTRY CLUB  Every hour there is a convenient shuttle to the private country club with a large swimming pool and comfortable deckchairs / lounges a bar La Maison's herbs & spices garden and the premise where they held their renowned cooking classes. Every day we were served welcome drinks. Additionally there had been many other surprizes (sometimes they told us that they have invited us for the other drinks we've ordered the other day we were given fresh watermelons or a refreshing facetowel etc).     COOKING CLASS:  We have attended La Maison's renowned cooking classes and we can really confirm all the good reviews: Not only was the cooking experience big fun and delicious but we've learned a lot about the Moroccan history and culture in general and its cuisine in specific. The only advice we can give is: just attend and be part of the cooking class in the oldest restaurant in the Medina and the city's first riad-hotel!,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Maienfeld, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rpfranger

I have to say it's one of the nicest hotels I have ever had the pleasure of staying at it.  It really made our trip to Marrakech all that more special.  The service we received at the hotel was outstanding. The staff quite literally fall over themselves to help you!  All our needs and requests were met they actually even preempted a lot of needs; booking us into restaurants organising chauffeurs etc They even kindly offered us a room to freshen up in before we headed to the airport on the evening of our departure (free of charge!).  The hospitality and generosity of this hotel exceeds any hotel I have stayed at and I have stayed at many 5* hotels across the world. They really could teach a lot of hotels a thing or two with regards to excellent customer service and how important attention to detail is.  On our first evening we dined at the hotels Moroccan restaurant which was was enjoyable and the breakfasts each morning were a relaxed and organised affair (unlike some hotels which can feel quite chaotic first thing!)  The accommodation itself is traditional and comfortable and exceptionally clean!  The country club is fantastic - it's a lovely oasis to escape too when the Medina gets too much.  As you can see I can't recommend this hotel highly enough and really hope to return in the not too distant future.

The entrance is quite tricky but as soon as you cross the reception every detail dazzles you. The rooms are cozy but luxurious. The restaurant is stunning an atmosphere around the pool set with live Moroccan music and delighting with exquisite food. We also had the chance to visit the Country Club a place 15 minutes away from the hotel whit a swimming pool beautiful gardens and a kitchen where you can have Moroccan cooking classes. I definitely recommend the cooking class you can learn the delicious Moroccan dishes as chicken tagine couscous and pita bread. But my favorite spot in the hotel was the Spa a luxurious relaxing place where you can experience the hammam or body massages with argan oil.

La Maison Arabe,Penfold1960 wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Top notch,It was 46 degrees in the shade when we landed in Marrakech so we were delighted to have a top notch place to stay cool down and relax. Everything was lovely; the room the pool the grounds the hammam the food the service - everything. Our three night stay was a delight. The air-conditioning in our room may have been working a little too hard in the heat as it started to drip water onto one of our suitcases we told reception about the problem - the air-con was fixed immediately and the damp clothes were laundered pressed and returned within a couple of hours.

La Maison Arabe,scorpioshanghai wrote a review Jul 2015,50,The best of the best,"This was the last stop on our 2 week trip to Morocco and along the way we stayed in several outstanding hotels and riads but La Maison Arabe is in a class of its own. The hotel is beautifully decorated - a mix of traditional Moroccan with updated modern touches that have all the mod cons one expects in a luxury 5 star establishment. But what pushes this hotel into the ""superlative"" category is the attention to detail and the personalized service that each and every staff member we encountered gave to us.    Our rooms were upgraded to suites overlooking the pool - a fabulous start! Housekeeping was excellent and our rooms were spotless each time we returned (they seemed to have perfected their timings of when to service the room!). The restaurant is outstanding - food was fine dining (without the fine dining price tag!) the poolside ambience is something out of the fairy tale A Thousand and One Nights (yes.....I know that's not based in Morocco but it did feel like it!) with superb service. We ended up eating there all 3 nights of our stay (despite attempting not to on our 2nd night!). They also have a ""country club"" where the cooking classes are held and it is a leafy private garden with a bigger pool as well as a simple lunch menu. A regular hourly shuttle transports you there in 15 minutes and we spent a most relaxing afternoon relaxing by the pool. Our daily jaunts into the medina and other parts of Marrakech were intersting and full of fun but we were always so happy to return to this haven of peace tranquility and smiling faces. The souks were fun but once we discovered the amazing little shop (that is accessed from outside of the hotel proper) where the gifts were of a higher quality yet not outrageously priced (and without the hassles of having to bargain!!) Plus the service in the shop carried on with the hotel tradition of being warm friendly helpful and personal. Our purchases were beautifully bubble wrapped packed and delivered to our rooms. If you need to do any souvenir shopping - this place is highly recommended! Free wifi throughout the hotel is excellent.    We also booked the hotel car for our departure at Casablanca airport and the Mercedes van and driver brought our dream trip to a wonderful conclusion. If in Marrakech - this is the only hotel you need consider in order to get an authentic Moroccan feel without sacrificing any of your personal comforts.

La Maison Arabe,TashDfromOz wrote a review Jul 2015,50,"Beyond ""WOW""!",Marrakech was the final destination of our 2 week tour of Morocco and I didn't think it could be possible for our trip to get any better than it had been - but all I can say about La Maison Arabe is WOW! This is the most beautiful ryad with staff who certainly went above and beyond during our 4 night stay. After welcome drinks in the beautiful courtyard we were given a tour of the ryad (so much hidden away - we had no idea how big it was!) and then we were surprised with an upgrade to the Royal Suite! And royal we felt! Our suite had 3 levels including our own private rooftop terrace complete with daybed and spa! The restaurant was amazing and we chose to dine in 3 out of 4 nights including 2 nights when the musicians were playing (well worth it!). All of the facilities were stunning and the hammam and spa were some of the best I have been to. Make sure you make time for a massage while you are there. The jazz bar is a beautiful space to retreat to for either a quiet drink or catch up with friends and the head barman (sorry his name escapes me) is one of the friendliest you will find. He went above and beyond one evening after I ordered some ice and limes for my suite and when he brought it up to the room he realised I was making capraioskas so he went back to the bar and made me up the sugar and lime mix and returned with several serves as well as bar snacks so that I could make them up in my room! You really can't do better than this ryad. Make sure you also try out the cooking school and visit the country club - really is an experience you will not forget.

La Maison Arabe,Victoria K wrote a review Jun 2015,50,stunning,We stayed at this hotel at the end of our trip in Morocco. We had previously been in Essaouira where it was cooler. When we arrived in Marrakech it was 40 degrees so the temperature took a lot of getting used to. The hotel is just stunning the restaurant area in the courtyard by the pool is incredibly picturesque and a lovely setting to have breakfast.    We didn't unfortunately sample the restaurant food but if the breakfast buffet is anything to go by i am sure it would be fantastic.    Our room was huge and immaculate with a lovely balcony overlooking the courtyard.    The staff were incredibly helpful from the moment we arrived nothing is too much trouble for them. I will also mention that we had only stayed for one night but we needed to leave our bags at the hotel after our night's stay to explore the city. When we came back to the hotel we had obviously spent a day walking around in intense heat the hotel manager very kindly gave us an unoccupied room to allow us to freshen up.

La Maison Arabe,sydneymum2 wrote a review Jun 2015,50,Beautiful riad with wonderfully attentive staff,We stayed for one night at the end of our two week independent trip around Morocco and wished we had planned to stay longer. The riad was beautiful the restaurant by the pool was stunning - we had an incredible dinner of very high international standard and I loved the pool and the sun terrace with loungers. We didn't have time to visit the country club but I felt very comfortable swimming in the riad pool - it is open to guests until 6pm and another couple also hopped in during the afternoon in the sun. However most noteworthy is the standard of the staff - their attention to detail was second to none including volunteering to check our flight details completing our disembarkation cards and packing up a beautiful breakfast for the airport.

La Maison Arabe,Raffa65 wrote a review Jun 2015,50,Why is La Maison Arabe not #1!!!,"Just got back from a two week trip to Marrakesh with my wife and daughter. Our itinerary was 3 nights at La Maison Arabe a desert trip return to La Maison for one night then spend 5 nights at the Royal Palm.  If we had to change anything about our trip it would be that we would drop the Royal Palm and stay at La Maison Arabe again. Why?? the human touch. From the front desk manager Adil and including Hisham and Moorad they were simply the best.  Welcoming us from the moment we got there. Hisham asked ""Do you like surprises"". With that he took us an unbelievable duplex room with roof terrance. I'm not sure why but it was greatly appreciated. Also I owe them a big thanks for assisting me in returning two carpets that I purchased in the sook I decided to cancel the order and they were instrumental in the store giving me a refund.  Finally I would like to mention that the hotel has access to a beautiful swimming pool area about 15 minutes drive. This is a great place to unwind and enjoy a relaxing day. In conclusion I cant say enough about this place and i'm amazed it's not number 1 however if they keep up the good work it will only be a matter of time.",Date of stay: June 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,New York,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Raffa65

Although situated in the Medina and close to all the interesting sites and the always fascinating Big Squate and souks the hotel is a haven of peace and luxury. The food is just superb and after trying another restaurant we decided we'd rather stay in and have our meals beside the beautiful pool. The staff were smilingly attentive and service excellent. Our suite was attractive and super comfortable and the bathroom big and super clean.

La Maison Arabe,beenaroundLondon wrote a review Jun 2015,50,Utterly delightful small hotel,If you are an independent traveller this is for you    No point in repeating other reviewers' superlatives but let me make one key point: Marrakech is hot/very hot/sweltering from May to November. There are not so many sights to visit and you will not want to spend all day in the souk. So you need somewhere to relax and this hotel owns a house outside the town which they use for special events seminars etc It has a large garden and swimming pool with food and drink on offer. It is perfect for an afternoon's relaxation.    For the rest : all the positive comments are true. Good people good restaurant nice rooms. The muezzin may wake you up but the comfort is such that you will get back to sleep. All this for about 180 Euros B&B : not a lot for a hotel of this class.    Also worth noting : you can walk to the medina restaurants when you want to eat out and there are plenty to choose from,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beenaroundLondon

La Maison Arabe,dawern wrote a review Jun 2015,50,top notch staff,Stayed here 4 nights last weekend. It may sound oblivious if you browse through these reviews but again the staff here is top notch. I've been in many places yet here the hospitality and service hits another level. And on top of that it feels absolutely sincere. Many high end places could take a lesson or two. For instance on our departure day our flight was scheduled in the evening and the hotel gratuitously offered us a suite in the afternoon to shower and fresh up before we left to the airport. And I have many more examples.    Furthermore it's ideally located and breaths an old-school boutique atmosphere no minimal design but sumptuous authenticity. The place is aging but well maintained it's a classic amongst hotels in Marrakech.    Coming from Amsterdam I'm familiar with small hallways many stairs and a labyrinth style lay-out but I can imagine this might feel a little claustrophobic at some point but for us it totally added to the charm. If you want to splurge though take one of the higher priced rooms. The patios added to the patio rooms feel a little cages.    Having said that 5 stars and the staff alone deserves it.,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dawern

I don't mean that in a negative way since as a result you get excellent customer service and all of the facilities you would expect from a 5 star hotel including a spa/hammam.    They also compensate for the limited space within the Medina by having a country club a 15 minute drive away which has a lovely swimming pool and relaxing atmosphere and again first rate customer service.

The staff was first rate helpful and always accommodating. Sadly we had been to Riad Fes first and the food there was beyond AMAZING. Not to say the food at La Maison Arabe was not good but it did not quite meet the quality as our prior stay.    We lucked out and got a suite that was located at the back of the hotel on the top floor. This room was ridiculously nice and HUGE. Bathroom was massive with a walk-in closet the size of a small bedroom the bed was very comfortable and the outside terrance was totally lovely.    The pool at the hotel is rather small and very public. But they have another amazing pool at this lovely country club just a 10 minute shuttle from the hotel. The staff there is delightful and very attentive. Personally I think the food at the country club is nicer than the food at the hotel.

La Maison Arabe,kupunakane wrote a review May 2015,50,"Beautiful riad, excellent staff",Maison Arabe is a beautiful place. In the medina with the entrance off of a narrow lane it is open attractive and spacious. Navigating the riad can be confusing as construction and remodeling have resulted in the presence of a number of stairways. But it is not a huge place and we enjoyed getting to see parts of the riad that we might otherwise not have seen. Our room was very comfortable and spacious. We enjoyed having outdoor breakfasts featuring fresh Moroccan bread and pancakes grilled to order. The breakfast and restaurant service was excellent as was the service throughout the hotel. In fact that was the highlight for me. I became ill from a viral infection on the drive from Fes to Marrakech and was quite weak on arrival. Osama assisted me in walking to our room even though my wife cautioned him about holding my hand lest he get sick. He said that he would do whatever he could to assist me. Throughout our stay he was concerned kind and always very friendly. While all the front desk staff members were friendly and efficient Murad also deserves special mention as he was exceptionally friendly and helpful. The location was great -- easy to reach tourist spots my foot. On our first full day when I stayed in the riad to recuperate my wife to the riad's cooking class. She thoroughly enjoyed it. This is one of those places where I regret that we will likely never return to Marrakech as I would love to stay here again. The only negative to me was the location of the swimming pool. I found it disconcerting to have people fortunately only a few swimming so close to people eating their meals.,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Hawaii,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kupunakane

La Maison Arabe,susanzs wrote a review May 2015,50,"La Maison Arabe is an oasis of calm and beauty in a bustling, colourful city",We highly recommend La Maison Arabe when staying in Marrakech. It is one of the most beautiful and charming hotels that we have ever stayed in. Every glance lands on a beautiful spot in the hotel with its beautiful wood carved wall panels stairs balconies glass furniture fire places light fixtures etc. The dining area is lovely and the breakfast is an event in itself - home made yogurt with a hint of vanilla home made breads omelettes and lots more. We loved our start to the day sitting under the trees. The staff were excellent - charming courteous helpful in every way possible including making recommendations for sight seeing arranging taxis and tour guides. The pool in the centre of the stunning tile lined walls next to the dining area was a welcome respite at the end of a day sight seeing. We loved the hotel so much we never ventured to the other pool and spa a 15 minute drive away. The visit to La Maison Arabe was greatly enhanced by all of the staff who were so helpful and the wonderful reception we received upon arrival and throughout our stay added to the treat of staying at the hotel and being in Marrakech. Though all very nice one of the staff at reception Hicham really stood out and it felt like we had become friends. His English was impeccable manner was dignified intelligent witty warm and kind and helpful. He added to our overall experience! My daughter loved having a head-to-toe treatment in the hamman on her birthday. Our special day in the Atlas Mountains was only topped by a surprise procession to our room upon arrival back at the hotel after celebrating with birthday dinner with an operatic rendition of Happy Birthday in Arabic and English by a group of the amazing staff and the gift of a birthday cake! This was truly unforgettable! We could have had a wonderful time just staying at the hotel but Marrakech is one of the most enchanting friendly fascinating beautiful bustling cities we have ever visited and an intriguing mix of ancient and modern traditional and contemporary. We dream of returning soon!,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanzs
La Maison Arabe,Sally Jones wrote a review May 2015,50,Happily not trying to rest on trip advisor laurels. Just doing a great job. I'll be back.,What a superb few days here. Approaching from the square is a little apprehensive but from then on in is just the best. 26 rooms which is considered large for a medina hotel but food and service utterly excellent and authentic. The m'semn at breakfast cooked by one of the resident dada was memorable. Have previously stayed in another riad in the medina but this is superior.    A trip to the Atlas Mountains well worth the money as was the cookery lesson within the hotel itself. Ate in many places across the medina and outside but maison Arabe the best. In fact some disappointing places to go to if you trust trip advisor. I went by word of mouth. Don't ever forget the old fashioned way of feedback.... Had two bad experiences but won't let that disrupt the review of this place.    Service first class and food excellent no stuck up their own behind just willing to please at all times.

La Maison Arabe,byphilosophie wrote a review May 2015,50,Amazing stay!,What an amazing place! With top notch service and excellent food we felt right at home at La Maison Arabe just better as we didn’t need to clean up nor wash dishes. Apparently this place started out as a Moroccan restaurant and expanded into a riad not surprising that it prided itself with its gastronomic offerings even cooking courses. We reserved the Sinbad suite for our family of three and were extremely pleased with the size and amenities. The separate living space was easily converted into a small bedroom for our five-year-old daughter and she was ecstatic to have her own little nuke. As we arrived early in the morning and our suite was not yet ready the staff even prepared a room for us to relax and freshen up.    Located inside the walled city of Marrakesh the Médina La Maison Arabe was only a 10-minute walk to the Jamaa el Fna square. Although in the scorching afternoon heat we took a short taxi ride costing between €2.00 – €2.50 the price depended on how well one bargained. The riad was small enough for that personal touch yet big enough that we didn’t feel like we were staying in a friend’s house (and talk to everybody). Each space was exquisitely decorated and best of all different. There was a hammam a spa and a pool. But if you want to get away from Marrakesh in the afternoon it has a private country club with a pool and a restaurant in the outskirts of the city. Just let the concierge know and they’ll arrange their free shuttle to bring you there.    Guests of La Maison Arabe were mainly on the older side or honeymooners but there were also some families. Regardless we had a wonderful stay and will definitely come back.,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,Europe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/byphilosophie
La Maison Arabe,Happiest_swimming wrote a review May 2015,40,Nice touches but too Western for our tastes,The layout of the hotel is part of its charms as is the service. It can be a bit of a struggle to remember the way to your room and to breakfast on the first couple of tries. There's a lively bar beautiful interiors and breakfast by the pool but it just doesn't compare to a riad. The room's although beautifully appointed are very similar to hotels all over the world. That may be exactly what you're looking for but as I like something a little more intimate and in the centre of activity in the Medina,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Happiest_swimming
La Maison Arabe,Scottish T wrote a review May 2015,50,Enchanting hotel with absolutely wonderful staff,We're just back from a four nights here.    We arrived at the hotel by car transfer (which the hotel very kindly arranged for us) and were greeted by the nicest reception staff we have ever met.    Our bags were taken to our room and we were shown to the lounge for an evening welcome drink and snack of olives nuts and small crackers. It was lovely after a long flight and even longer queue at passport control.    We were then shown around the beautiful hotel and to our wonderful room with its own little privet terrace. The rooms are a really lovely size bathroom also a good size with nice toiletries and rose petals on the bed and in the bathroom. Lovely touch.    Dinner was very kindly reserved for us in the pool side international/Moroccan restaurant we both had the traditional Moroccan tagine one beef and one chicken they were both amazing but I have never tasted anything as good as the chicken tagine..... Ever!    We ate in the hotel 3 out of the 4 nights the other 2 meals we had in the Moroccan restaurant again the food is to die for and the atmosphere in the Moroccan restaurant is very relaxing peaceful and romantic.    The housekeeping came twice a day morning and evening to turn down the bed change the towels and replace any toiletries used.  The hotel is absolutely enchanting and feels very traditional Moroccan.    You have access to the privets country club where there is a pool and more fantastic Moroccan food. Don't miss the chance of using the country club the shuttle bus leaves the hotel from 10.30am every hour. It is such a lovely place away from the hustle and bustle of the busy markets and souks.    Every day before we left the hotel we handed our key into reception and every night on our return our key was handed to us without ever having to give our room number! The hotel has 26 rooms which makes this a very personal and special place.    The staff are absolutely wonderful at La Masion Arabe always smiling and so happy to chat or give you assistance. This is the best customer service we have ever received while staying at any hotel anywhere. The staff really made this a wonderful experience for us.    I wish we had stayed longer as we would have loved to have taken one of the Moroccan cooking classes. They looked like so much fun and we would have loved to find out how to make the tagines!    A HUGE thank you to all the staff for your kindness you made us feel very welcome from the moment we arrived which really made our holiday very special.,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Scotland, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottisht2015

La Maison Arabe,Kyawmyokhine wrote a review May 2015,50,The best hotel we have stayed in,"We were met at the airport by the hotel's driver and was transferred to the hotel in a Mercedes minibus. When we first arrived at the street in front of the hotel I was having second thoughts as this was supposed to be a 5 starred hotel. We were escorted down an alley way with grave concerns.    When we entered the hotel it was something totally unexpected. We were escorted to an atrium and was given a chance to relax. The Morroco-hitos are very good and refreshing. Whilst we were relaxing with our mocktails checking in was done and our luggage was taken to our room.    Adil (front desk manager) showed us around the communal areas of the hotel before escorting us to our room. Every part was beautifully decorated and immaculately maintained. There was no dust on anything (I did check). This hotel was impeccable and we learned to never trust a riad by the alley way it is on.    We stayed in suite 222 and it was perfect. Dual sinks waterfall shower and separate bath in the bathroom; Separate toilet and bidet; Walk in wardrobe; Queen sized bed stereo and flat screen TV; Lounge area with settee a Nespresso coffee machine and refrigerator; Large balcony with sun loungers and a veranda area. Breakfast and afternoon tea on the veranda was lovely.    The hotel was only surpassed by the attentiveness of the staff. They were always friendly and very accommodating. We were most impressed with four particular incidences. The first was when I enquired where we might get some strawberries and oranges and they immediately went out and got us some. The second was when Adil was trying to flag us a taxi to the new town and ended up having a heated debate with the taxi driver. We found out that it should only cost 20 dirhams but the taxi driver was trying to charge us a ""tourist price"" of 50 dirhams and had a go at Adil for telling us that it should only cost 20 dirhams. We have never had this level of protectiveness towards hotel guest before. The third was when I was speaking to Hicham enquiring of where I might purchase a good quality Panama hat. He rang the shop for us and even offered to get the guy to come and collect us from the hotel. We have never had this level of attentiveness towards hotel guest before. The forth was when we asked where we might get some good quality sea food and was recommended to go to Al Bahriya. We later bumped into a member of the hotel staff eating at the same restaurant with his family. Honesty and transparency goes a long way.    The spa was an excellent way to start a holiday. We had the imperial package which involved a hamman with kessa body scrub orange blossom honey body mask facial mask geranium scented sea salt body mask a radiance facial 30 minute massage and poolside lunch. We added a manicure and pedicure and an extra 30 minutes massage. I have never seen disposable underwear before.    The cooking workshop was a fun and interesting experience. The workshop was clean and professional with individual work stations for each student. The chef gave a very informative and relaxed lecture on Moroccan food and spices. We cooked a chicken tagine baked bread and made two types of salads. We also had a demonstration of the art of Moroccan mint tea. Lucky for me my partner and myself decided to eat the others cooking.    The taster menu at the restaurant was excellent. The setting was beautiful and relaxed and front of house service was attentive. The kitchen did not disappoint as well. There was a huge mixture of appetisers bastille tagines and desert. The presentation smells textures and flavours were sublime. There were local musicians and I was presented a birthday cake by two Gnawa singers with their own rendition of ""happy birthday"" whilst spinning their tassels.    The country club a paradise away from the hustle and bustle of the medina. We had missed the hourly minibus shuttle so the hotel arranged immediately a free taxi to the place (fifth impressive incidence of service level). There was some building work but this did not interfere with the ambiance of the place. The place was spacious and serene and the garden was a pleasure to walk around. The kebab lunch was excellent.    We loved our experience so much that we extended our stay for two extra nights and was upgraded to the suite 227. This suite was huge and stunning. It had a living room and bathroom on floor one mezzanine bedroom with bathroom on floor two and a private roof terrace with jacuzzi on floor three.    We would like to send our thanks to the wonderful team at La Maison Arabe for giving us a memorable experience of Marrakech and are looking forward to coming back.",Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Preston,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kyawmyokhine

La Maison Arabe,Janet M wrote a review Apr 2015,50,Fantastic cooking class,Three of us attended the cooking class offered by La Maison Arabe. Prior to leaving for the cooking class we enjoyed Moroccan tea served to us in the area around a lovely fountain at the hotel. Had we seen this boutique hotel before booking a timeshare in Marrakech we would have stayed here. The hotel is stunningly beautiful. The actual cooking class takes place outside the city and has a lovely garden. The cooking class was intended to be a special present for my husband. It turned out to be one of my favorite activities of the entire three week trip in Morocco. The woman who taught the class spoke excellent English and we learned a lot about the Moroccan culture by taking this class. The class started with a tour of the herb garden and a demonstration on how to bake Moroccan bread. After these events we went to a well appointed kitchen. Each work station included everything needed to prepare the meal. The cooking class offered an overhead TV screen so you could easily see what the cooks were doing. The class also had sufficient staff who were always available to help and offer guidance.The food we cooked was excellent. After preparing the meal we all sat down to enjoy a mid-afternoon lunch at a beautifully appointed table.. At the end of the cooking class each participant received a certificate and a tagine as a take home present. We also purchased the La Maison Arabe cookbook and are planning to make a Moroccan meal for our friends in two weeks time. Well worth the money.

The room I had was large comfortable and quiet (far from the madding crowd outside). Beautifully decorated with a large bed and rose petals everywhere to impress the missus. Service was exceptional. A free bottle of wine on arrival plus free refreshing drinks free bottled water for our excursions - which the hotel helped us to arrange - we went on two separate day-trips one to the Atlas Mountains and another to Ait Benhaddou. Our driver spoke good English and was able to tell us a lot about the history and locations - the car was a spacious clean and new Toyota Landcruiser (the excursions cost £90 and £150 respectively). The riad itself is decorated in the traditional Moroccan style and finishing is to a high standard. The breakfast buffet is excellent with a broad selection of hot and cold food to suit all tastes. In fact the dining area by the pool is fantastic and the food served is of a very high standard - though of course expensive by Moroccan standards. Frankly it's hard to fault this hotel which does everything to a high standard and is conveniently located just a short walk from Jemaa el fna.

La Maison Arabe,ChrisCBlake wrote a review Apr 2015,50,Amazing hotel and staff - one of the best I have ever stayed in.,Last year we went to La Maison Arabe and were totally enchanted by the hotel its staff and the town of Marrakech. So if we went a second time would it really be as good as we remembered - could it possibly be as wonderful again? The answer is a resounding 'yes'. The fabric of the hotel is truly magical - with a wonderful balance between ancient charm and modern facilities. We had a Junior Suite with a balcony overlooking the small pool and restaurant. Only having 23 rooms give the hotel a real intimate and friendly atmosphere. It is close enough to the centre of the town to be able to walk to the main historic sites. Walking through Marrakech is a true joy the architecture and atmosphere are superb - it is very different from European cities. Providing you are able to say 'no' with a smile or bargain with a smile then everyone is very friendly. On the second day we took a taxi to the beautiful coastal town of Essaouira - well worth a visit. The third day was spent at La Maison Arabe's Country Club - this is a large magnificent garden with a superb pool and mini-restaurant under the trees just out of town. The hotel provides free transport in both directions. As only hotel guests are allowed then it is never crowded. The restaurant at La Maison Arabe is truly wonderful providing both Moroccan and European menus - although within reason the chefs seem very willing to provide whatever is requested. Also it is worth remembering that in the 1930’s La Maison Arabe started as a restaurant and was one of Winston Churchill’s favourites. However the real strength of La Maison Arabe is its staff - they seem to be everywhere always helpful always smiling. Amazingly within a day or so they all seem to know your name - wherever you are in the hotel. For us a third visit is a near certainty - and there are very few hotels in the world that I would put in that category.,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisCBlake

The original features have been magnificently restored and the ambiance is amazing. Our suite was magnificent and beautifully decorated. We ate at both the main restaurant and the pool side restaurant - both of which have delicious food and local musicians playing traditional music and both these really should be tried. We took the cookery class which was so much fun and in the stunning surroundings of the La Maison country club. and used the hammam facilities which are truly beautiful .    The location is perfect in a lovely quite lane yet walking distance from the soul of the city ie the souks and the historic landmarks such as Ben Youssef Madrassa  Kotoubia la jardin marjorelle  and our favourite which is a quaint little place called Al Kawtar on Rue Laksour  which is a workshop where beautiful embroidered items are hand made by disabled women.    But without a doubt the best part of this Riad are the staff. Every single one of them from the doormen to the waiters and waitresses and off course all the staff on the front desk were the most professional caring friendly staff we have ever encountered. They organised everything for us from day trips to the ourika valley to restaurant bookings and we cannot speak highly enough of them; in particular 3 gentlemen on the front desk named Aadil Murad and Ismail- wonderfully professional and courteous people!!

The breakfasts were amazing with lots of fresh fruit and hot and cold options. The fresh Moroccan crepes were fab.

The public areas were beautifully decorated as well - the lanterns are gorgeous. The poolside lounge area and restaurant were nice for lounging. If we had one negative it was that the pool was not heated and was icy cold in spring so my kids could not swim but they sure tried!    Location is excellent and near enough to the main square to walk. It is very quiet except for the call to prayer at 5:00 am but that's Morocco!    We also ate at the restaurant 2 nights in a row. We weren't going to but the first night it was so good that we went again. Try the lamb dish with lemons - my husband swears I licked the plate. He and the kids also enjoyed the chicken bastilla.

La Maison Arabe,JAMBrooklyn wrote a review Apr 2015,50,Perfection in the Medina,First I must admit that due to some kind of error we were upgraded to the royal suite. All I can say is you need to hope this error happens to you too. The room consisted of a main floor with two twin beds a full bath couches and a desk an upper balcony with a king bed and full bath and a private roof top terrace (with hot tub). Rose petals were everywhere when we arrived and they were gone when we went to bed. There were heated towel racks showers and baths in the bathrooms and a nespresso maker in the living room. Enough said... The hotel is a warren of rooms due to the fact that it is several buildings that have been combined but each is lovely and warm. The staff was exceptionally kind and welcoming my only complaint being that at breakfast each day it took them a little time to get with the program. Since it was by the beautiful pool I didn't really mind waiting a bit. An evening visit to the bar provided some exceptional people watching although the stock of liquor is not extensive (I should be grateful for what they did have!). This hotel is as others have stated an oasis hidden down a plain passage and red walls. While within the Medina it is a little ways from the Square--don't let that deter you though!

La Maison Arabe,Lanno wrote a review Apr 2015,50,An oasis of cool calm in a hot busy city,Personally I don't think this hotel can be bettered. Immediately you enter you become aware of the cool calm atmosphere of this beautiful place.  Our room was lovely with an outside balcony and everything we could possibly need scattered liberally with rose petals. After being greeted by the very friendly reception staff on arrival we were given a welcome drink in one of the many areas available to sit and relax in. Then a tour of the facilities - the restaurants and bar the pool and the wellness centre - before being shown to our room. This was followed by complimentary afternoon tea and pastries by the pool.  In the evening there are musicians in each of the eating areas. We ate in the Moroccan restaurant and the food was so good that we ate far too much. The tagines are so good - I had the lamb and have since bought their cookbook.  Marrakesh is extremely noisy and busy but you would not know it inside this hotel and it was very quiet at night - we previously stayed in another hotel in Marrakesh with street traders shouting above the drummers under our window until 3am every night!  We only stayed one night here (and I wish it had been longer) so left our baggage at the hotel while we explored the souks. When we returned they suggested we shower and change before our flight in the Wellness centre which was another bonus.  The staff are all very friendly and keen to help and we had a great stay.,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Sussex,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lanno
La Maison Arabe,Mikhail V wrote a review Apr 2015,50,Luxury Boutique Hotel/Riad with Great Service,La Maison Arabe very nicely splits the difference between a riad and a luxury hotel. The service is very friendly and helpful but the hotel has excellent facilities including a beautiful hammam that tend to come with larger luxury hotels. We really appreciated the nice car that they provided to take us to Essaouira. Our room was a junior suite overlooking the pool which is stunning at night. The hotel is within the medina but not in the heart of it. It is nicely removed from some of the chaos. I will say that the food prices were far too high at the hotel. I do not like to gripe over pricing but we paid New York prices for food and that is too much in Morocco. (The cooking class is also too expensive.) I will say that the food is excellent at the hotel's two restaurants and it is clearly a point of pride.,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LMZV

La Maison Arabe,SNRinLondon wrote a review Apr 2015,50,Excellent,The hotel is full of character and positioned in the medina so location wise you will need to keep an open mind it is not so obvious in terms of curtsied appeal. having said that the hotel itself is very nice traditional and comfortable. The outstanding feature of the hotel is the standard of service which was really very good by any standards I have experienced - friendly and courteous without being formal or stuffy. The staff provided afternoon tea and wonderful traditional biscuits which made for a relaxing and cosy afternoon. It was cold during my stay so despite the sun you need some warm layers. We tried the country club which was charming and the staff there equally as polite and attentive the pool there is lovely and the gardens very nice. The cookery class was fun and well worth it fun and extremely well done I guarantee you will be impressed it is rather sophisticated - you can do it at the hotel or at the country club - the country club is a better more spacious location. The only weak point was the spa which was not a strength not worth it. Food was great although just like any international high end hotel so we felt rather expensive particularly the traditional Moroccan restaurant. The cocktail; bar on the other hand was great we eat there several evenings and the head barman was exceptionally good: fun a big personality - great service you must try. Overall very good and we would absolutely go back. It is not luxurious but it very comfortable and beautifully done.,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SNRinLondon
La Maison Arabe,Patricia C wrote a review Apr 2015,50,Decor and Ambience are Amazing,A group of fourteen friends stayed four nights at La Maison Arabe during the first week of March. We have traveled all over the world and would put this hotel right at the top of our list of favorites. The hotel is French owned and is furnished with beautiful antiques and everything is designed for comfort. There are only 26 rooms I believe and they are all spacious suites. Ours had a living room. large bedroom very modern bath and a private balcony with bougainvillea blooming on it. We thought the food and the service were outstanding.

La Maison Arabe,MrshappySevenoaks wrote a review Apr 2015,40,A beautiful haven from all the hussle and bussle,We stayed here in March enjoying all that this fabulous place could offer but after four days felt ready to move on to the Atlas mountains for peace and tranquility. None-the-less we had fantastic food here and hammam was absolutely fantastic. The staff were all extremely pleasant and helpful especially the man on reception who gave us lots of good advice. My one quibble would be the fact we were charged for the coffee we made in our own room. I have never had this charge in any other hotel I have ever stayed in and felt it was rather 'penny-pinching'.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Kent, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrshappySevenoaks

It really was the most wonderful hotel I have ever experienced. The staff were delightful smilingwelcoming and thoughtfully provided every service with great professionalism and without being obsequious.  The place itself is a delight with open fires dotted around including in our suite(which was a free upgrade) beautiful decor with every modern facility whilst retaining a truly authentic atmosphere.  We had the three day package which included a walking tour(wear comfy shoes) which showed us places which we would probably never have found ourselves and if we had possibly would not have found our way back! Also included was the horse-drawn carriage tour in and around the medina which was great fun and expanded our knowledge of the city.

La Maison Arabe,Wan T wrote a review Apr 2015,50,The best riad in Marrakech,This is my umpteenth visit to Marrakech and I've stayed in lots of different hotels and other riads. But La Maison Arabe is very special. Firstly the staff are excellent - from the booking experience to the welcome - this is service of an extraordinary standard.  Some of the carpets are getting a little tired (stairwell to the pool) but it all adds to the authenticity. It really is a beautiful vast riad that is made up of several riads that have been combined over the years. It was good to see the same faces as it's been two years since I last stayed here and the staff are still the same.  I had a cough on arrival but was promptly supplied with a ginger and herbal concoction to cure my ills.  You have to have a hammam! This is the best it gets in Marrakech - outstanding. Can't recommend this oasis highly enough - it's worth every single penny and probably more.,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WanT936
La Maison Arabe,FrequentDiners352 wrote a review Apr 2015,50,We only ate in the restaurant but.....,It was fantastic. A real high point of our culinary visit to Morocco. It started out with a delicious fig/olive tapenade and carrot orange soup progressed to a fantastic monkfish tagine and chicken with preserved lemons and olives tagine. Everything was delicious and so richly flavorful and the setting by the pool was incredible. Out only regret was we didn't come every night for dinner and if it hadn't been our last night we certainly would have. The server was the sweetest and most attentive and I could kick myself that I can't remember his name but I did compliment him to the manager. I asked if it was possible to get any of their recipes and he brought me out a calendar/recipe book that I will certainly be using.

La Maison Arabe,Amipan wrote a review Apr 2015,50,Beautiful building and lovely staff,"The hotel is located just a few minutes walk from the Souk. The entrance is off a typical bustling Marrakech street but as soon as you turn into the surprisingly clean and wide ""alley"" leading to the hotel you get a sense that you are about to enter a peaceful Oasis. The hotel does not disappoint. The hotel as its name alludes to is a large luxurious arab style house. The decor combined with the very friendly and attentive service it made us feel like we were guests being welcomed into the house of a Marrakech nobleman.    After being served mint tea and some interesting juice drinks we were taken to our room. We were upgraded to a large suite which was very tastefully appointed and even had a private verandah! The bed was great and the room had all of the modern amenities one would expect in a nice hotel. None of the street noise came through and we had a great nights sleep.    We ordered room service for breakfast. The traditional pancake with the works (olives onions etc.) was delicious and the pastry basket was good. I would also recommend the chicken tagine in the traditional Berber restaurant downstairs.    An enjoyable stay. I would definitely recommend La Maison Arab over the generic soul-less 4 and 5 star hotels that are becoming more prevalent in Marrakech.",Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"San Francisco, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amipan

La Maison Arabe,cazlilly wrote a review Apr 2015,50,Lived up to expectation and more,So many of these Reviews say the same thing excellent staff stunning decor amazing location all i am going to do is reiterate every single compliment that people have made about this amazing place that I did not want to leave after 7 nights.    From Porters Front of House Restaurant Pool Bar Housekeeping every single person that works here is so friendly and are there to make your stay memorable for all the right reasons and they all succeeded.    Hotel Room: faultlessly clean daily housekeeping at all times of the day turn down service at night and a fresh bottle of water each day. Faultlessly clean. We had the most amazing private patio robes and slippers and in room safe. Coffee and mini bar are chargeable with a Moroccan beer being 60 dirham and half a bottle of white wine 100.    Moroccan Restaurant: Sumptuous surroundings excellent live music 3 choices of starter at 150 dirham and 5 choices of mains 3 tajines and 2 cous cous starting at 150 dirhams.    Restaurant by the Pool: a huge choice of moroccan cuisine and french prices start at the same as above I had the most tasty seared foie gras here that I've ever eaten. Again excellent live music too.    Room Service: A varied menu but you can also order from the restaurant menu to have that delivered to your room    Jazz Bar: i loved it in here pianist friendly staff the nibbles that you get with every drink cocktails are 100 dirhams after trying three different cocktails though i decided that there wasn't quite enough alcohol in them to hit the spot so I switched to G & T.    Wine: A varied wine list with only Moroccan wines to choose from which is fabulous bottles start at 200 dirhams.    Country Club: A tropical paradise in a bustling city 15 mins by private minibus upon arrival you receive a refreshing drink you can then order food and drinks as you wish where you see the chefs preparing and cooking the food and there is a small outside area where tables are set for dining the loungers and cabanas are luxury. Lunches here start from about 100 dirhams and drink prices the same as hotel of course it is exclusive to hotel guests and i think we shared with only 8 people max plenty of space. The large pool is colder than the hotel pool.    Hammam: this was a different experience for me I went for the royal hammam which was to last 45 mins you are given a locker robe and slippers and the tiniest piece of material held together with elasitic to wear for yout treatment. The hammam was a great experience and ladies they scrub evverywhere but one place! but the lighting in the room does not make it uncomfortable I did expect a 45 min treatment though but in actual fact it was 25 mins and then you get to lay on a bed in the spa for 20 mins. I also had deep tissue full body massage for 60 mins again this does not mean a 60 min massage but 40 mins with 20 mins laying on a bed in the spa this was my only disappointment the whole trip. Ladies be prepared they massage the whole body! And in my opinion was a good massage but nothing special.    Cookery School: what an experience watching bread been made and cooked in a wood oven making yourself two starters and then a tajine all in the most amazing kitchen with screens in front of you showing what the Dada is doing I would without question do this again. It cost 600 dirhams.    Please when budgeting for your trip here be aware that 10% is added to everything which is then distributed around the stagg they deserve every single penny of it.    Wifi throughout the hotel is efficient and very quick.    Location: easy 10 minute walk to souks or the oppostie direction 15 mins to the square perfect.

We were upgraded to a wonderful suite (room 218) that had a living area a separate bedroom a private outdoor courtyard and a separate alcove sleeping area that our daughter used.

Impeccable taste distinguishes each room the scale is perfect and the location leaves the guest within easy walking distance of the Souk. Not that you'd ever want to leave the hotel.

La Maison Arabe,Matt P wrote a review Mar 2015,50,The Epitome of Service and Luxury in the heart of Marrakech,We had a wonderful 4 nights in this high quality hotel in the Medina of Marrakech. There is much to compliment the high standards which are provided by this 5 Star Hotel. This memorable experience began as soon as we arrived at the hotel reception area- our room was given a free upgrade to a suite with an adjoining private courtyard & seating area!!  The Fine Dining experiences provided at both the 'Morrocan' and 'Les Trois Saveurs' restaurants were exceptional with the excellent choices of local cuisine and a high standard of service. We did not dine at the Piano Bar during our stay but this also was a bar area of high ambiance and quality. Breakfast was served by the poolside with an excellent selection of local juices breads fruit and freshly cooked eggs and crepes!!  During our stay we had the pleasure of experiencing the delights of the Hammam & Wellness centre in the basement area of the hotel- the massages and skin treatments were truly worthwhile after a long day in the heat & hassles of the markets and we would recommend that you book well ahead of your stay. The hotel has its own pool area in the main building but for a much more relaxing experience a trip to the country club during the afternoon is a great way to relax the rest of the day away- a free mini luxury shuttle is provided every hour by the hotel for this 20 minute journey to the edge of town.  The very helpful reception staff and management were also able to provide a tailor made trip for us to the foothills of the Atlas Mountains as well as return transfers to the airport- both offered very good value with an excellent local guide called Abdullah provided throughout.  I was particularly impressed with the service and friendliness offered by the hotel reception team when my wife became ill one evening- an offer of specific medication and sustenance to help with her recovery was much appreciated and helpful at the time. These are the little extras that make the hotel the excellent place that it is.  All in all a great location and high level of luxury for a trip to Marrakech whether on business or for a holiday.

We took the complimentary shuttle to the country club and my wife had a massage in the hammam.    Everything was pretty faultless. The food in particular was superb -- I'd be surprised if you could get better in Marrakech. Nice that you can get this quality of accommodation and food inside the medina. When you step out of the hotel entrance you are right in the thick of the rabbit warren of alleys that lead to the souks though it's only a short walk to the nearest taxi-friendly road. Maybe a little less authentic than some of the central riads but it's nice to have a pool you can swim in.    Hard to complain about the country club as it was free. Pool large and chlorine-free but unheated so for serious swimmers only (probably warmer in high summer). I think it is rather stretching things to describe it as a country club; more a garden with a pool.    My wife tells me the hammam was excellent -- peaceful atmosphere and great massage.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hythe, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/collideorscape

When inquiring about making a reservation for the restaurant we were treated to a full tour of both restaurants as well as the kitchen where open cooking classes take place and also the spa where you can book a hammam and massage for 650dirham.  The International Restaurant exquisitely encircles a courtyard pool which provides for a very romantic ambience with ornate candlelight and traditional Moroccan musical accompaniment. The setting was perfect and the service was good. The menu offers a selection of both international as well as Moroccan dishes; so even when choosing to eat at the “international” restaurant you can still avail of a full Moroccan menu but without the option of tasting platters - which is only available in the Moroccan restaurant. Nonetheless it was a difficult choice to make from a very inclusive menu even when limiting ourselves to the more traditional Moroccan selection. The traditional salads to-start is most recommendable and there is also a generous range of lamb dishes as main courses as well as fish and vegetarian dishes.  We started the evening with a cocktail in the jazz bar which was recommended to us by the staff as well. Here we were amongst fellow tourists of course but the atmosphere was comfortable and the service excellent with fantastic drinks and the complimentary provision of olives and nuts as snacks. This was overall a very enjoyable experience in a relaxed environment. As a bonus we were given a calendar with recipes from the hotel kitchen at the end of our meal – a very special souvenir to remember a beautiful evening and hopefully a way of capturing some of those memorable Moroccan flavours in a meal of our own back home.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juanbH5973PK

La Maison Arabe,travelerfl0rida wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Wonderful stay,Stayed two nights in this delightful hotel. Started by being taken into a lounge area and given a refreshing drink. Just nice to have something different than the usual mint tea. The hotel arranged a guide at a very reasonable price Abdul (Abderrahmane Belmoudden) which made it lot easier to get around the first day. Would highly recommend letting them arrange a guide on the first day in Marrakech. The service and staff were excellent. The breakfast buffet by the pool is lovely and was a nice change from most of the riads. Enjoyed the piano- jazz bar. The drinks and the music were excellent. Eat at Les Trois Saveurs one evening which was very good but not as good as Gastro MK.

La Maison Arabe,Sara B wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Unforgettable weekend in a beautiful oasis,Staying at La Maison Arabe for our wellness weekend among 5 friends was the best choice ever. Discovering this authentic jewel in the narrow streets of the Medina was even better than the excellent reviews could describe. We were suddenly transported into another world a pleasure for all senses with attention to detail in every corner. The architecture authentic design and decorations are stunning. We stayed in the Royal Suite which was amazing spacious and with a private terrasse.    The welcome and service was excellent (thanks so much for the welcome bottle!) everyone was very friendly with smiling faces and most helpful.    The spa is beautifully decorated with majestic lamps and the traditional hammam  was a unique experience followed by a fantastic massage.    The restaurants are both very good and well situated. The first evening we had dinner at the Moroccan restaurant and were very impressed with the quality of the lamb melting in our mouths like butter. The food was delicious. The second evening we ate at the restaurant “Trois Saveurs” and really enjoyed staying by the pool next to the beautiful live and relaxing music. We had our first breakfast on our private terrasse which was a treat as we could soak the sun and see the roofs of Marrakech but the delicious breakfast served by the pool the next morning was even better with so much choice. Really loved the morrocan pancakes and fresh juices. The jazz bar was a great relaxing experience too with great music.    The location is perfect. Very close to the airport and an easy 10 minutes walk to the Jemaa e-fns square. We were accompanied by a local guide recommended by the hotel and we had an excellent afternoon in the Medina. The only regret I could have is that our stay was too short to try the cooking lesson and the swimming pool country club. Would love to go back and will definitely recommend La Maison Arabe.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Canton of Geneva, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R5237NBsarab

La Maison Arabe,Jane3 wrote a review Mar 2015,50,"Top notch accommodation, but retains character and colour",There are I'm sure more expensive glossier hotels in Marrakech. But I doubt any can compare to the experience enjoyed at Maison Arabe.    The accommodation itself is faultless. The rooms are highly equipped forensically clean comfortable and decorated to a high standard. We experienced two rooms - one for the duration of our stay and one for a late check out. Both were of a very high standard.    The food is wonderfully Moroccan with tagines chicken and couscous being firm favourites. The bar has a jazz pianist some evenings and Rachid the head barman will ply you with cocktails to your heart's content.    But it is the service which sets this place above others. The attention from staff is second to none (and without any obsequiousness). Adil Chaif the front office manager is a mult-tasker extraordinaire. Speaking umpteen languages he will arrange anything for you at any time.    We took advantage of the in house spa to have a hammam and deep tissue massage. A word to the ladies our (shared) hammam was given by a woman but unlike Turkish baths I've been to before they wash your entire top half (and will remove bikini tops or roll down swimsuits). Likewise the massage. I'd definitely visit the spa again but a word of warning would have been helpful !    We also went to the country club affiliated to the riad. Only riad guests can visit. It's about a 15 minute taxi ride away and you use the hotel shuttle. We were the only people there and it was beautiful. The unheated pool was still too cold in late Feb but we paddled and sunbathed. The ride there is any eye-opener in itself.    All in all we loved our visit. There aren't many easy-to-reach places within 3 and a half hours of the UK which are pretty warm in February but we had temperatures in the low 20s the entire time (but they plummet at night so you need a sweater).    Marrakech is exotic colourful and very un-European so it was an exciting three days topped off with flopping on sun beds at the country club.,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jane3

La Maison Arabe,LW54 wrote a review Mar 2015,50,A 5* Riad with a personal touch,My husband and I stayed at La Maison Arabe at the end of Feb/early March for a week. As well as a city break and some sun we needed a much needed chance to recharge our batteries and the Riad ticked all the boxes. I booked directly and my emails were answered quickly. I had asked for a couple of items which were not standard in the rooms and when we arrived they were already there. Adil was always friendly and nothing was too much trouble for him!    Afternoon tea was served every day anywhere you liked and believe me there are lots of different places to have it! When we first arrived it seemed like a maze of little rooms but it added to the character. The decor was amazing and turning day into night was done with taste. We booked a deluxe garden room which was on the second floor and overlooked the pool. We were able to sit on the balcony and listen to the music from the restaurant but if we closed our windows we couldn't hear a thing. The room was very comfortable. The bed was one of the comfiest I have slept in. We ate in both restaurants and found them equally excellent and I have written a separate review. On our first night I was serenaded and presented with a birthday cake as the manager had seen from my passport that it had recently been my birthday. Breakfast by the pool was a lovely leisurely start to the day. The biggest problem was deciding what to have! Nothing was too much for the staff and they were attentive but not intrusive but always happy for a chat.    The country club was well worth a visit. It's very calm and food is just as good as at the hotel. The water was cold but heated up during the course of our week but I actually like cold water! The hotel was well situated for walking to everything and we felt safe. We did a trip to the Ourika valley with a driver called Abdullah who was tremendous. We did it on a Saturday and as a result visited a local market which was very different to the Souk! I could go on and on but other reviews say it all The staff deserve a special mention for their attentiveness and friendly service.,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Sheffield,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LW54

And unless you knew La Maison's 'hidden secret' you would never have found the Country Club. What an amazing hideaway. We more or less had this to ourselves - a great pool bar snacks and a haven of peace and quiet.

La Maison Arabe,Articulate A wrote a review Mar 2015,50,"Truly wonderful hotel, I can't recommend it enough",I stayed here for a week in February and had an excellent time. The staff were incredibly attentive for example on the first morning I ordered a large black decaf coffee with my breakfast the following morning they greeted me by name and asked if I would like a large black decaf coffee. They also noticed that I walked with a limp and on my third day they said that a room without stairs had become free and asked if I would like them to upgrade me to that room free of charge. I left my key with reception when I went out and when I got back they had moved all my stuff for me.  One night I ate at a restaurant outside the hotel and not only did the doorman walk me to the restaurant so I didn't get lost but they also gave me a mobile phone programmed with the hotel's number so I could phone when I wanted to be escorted back to the hotel. They made it clear that it was safe for me to walk around on my own - the service was only to avoid me getting lost.  I decided mid-week that I wanted to do the hotel's cookery course. As I was the only person booked on that afternoon's course they offered me the option of taking the course at the hotel or their country club. I said that as I was the only person booked on the course then I was happy to change date but they inisted that they would run the course as it was my preferred date. I choose to take the course at the hotel. They said that the course finished at 6pm and people usually ate the food they had cooked at the end of the course however as they knew I preferred to eat at 8pm then they would keep my food and I could have it in the restaurant at 8pm.  I went out to the Country Club one afternoon and was planning to catch the 6pm hourly shuttle back to the hotel. The sunset at 5.15pm and I started to get very cold. I spoke to the member of staff there and he said that as the Country Club closed at 6pm and I was the only person there was a chance that he might be able to get the shuttle bus to come and pick me up early. He phoned the driver and he picked me up about 10 minutes later.  All these little helpful things really made my holiday one that will stay special in my memory.    Additonally the beds were exceedingly comfortable the showers nicely powerful and the location superb.,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Cheltenham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArticulateA

Highlights are these;    The staff who are unfailingly courteous helpful interested polite and anxious to ensure that you have all that you might need.    The rooms we overlooked the central (heated) pool in the middle of the building/s with a view of the nearby mosque. It was wonderful fresh flowers and fruit a huge and comfortable bed... every small luxury you can imagine.    The Hammam.... not something that would be ""my thing"" but I went with my wife. The room is underground is extremely pleasant and relaxing nice lights very chilled-out atmosphere and great treatments... we had a fairly basic massage and this was fabulous.    The food; both restaurants are great I probably preferred the Moroccan but both were good. Beware of the ""set menu"" unless you have a vast appetite all great but huge quantities.    The cookery course... great fun in a pleasant setting 100% suitable for non-cooks and fun for those who usually make dinner! Nice to sit under a tree eating the lunch you just made making new friends.    Trip to the Atlas mountains.... super.    Outside the hotel there's a zillion things to do and see...

La Maison Arabe,Kathryn M wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Wonderful Hotel/Riad,My husband and I stayed at La Maison Arabe for 4 nights in December while on a 3+ week tour of Morocco. This was a fabulous riad away from the bustling medina but within close proximity. While the lobby was modest our room which was a suite was wonderful. It overlooked the pool and had a large balcony which we used to relax in the late afternoon after sight seeing. The service was first rate. The manager of the bar made great drinks and was very personable and warm clearly proud of his job. Each morning we were greater by a welcoming staff who made certain everything at breakfast was to our liking. One night we had dinner in their Moroccan restaurant and it was excellent with great service. To demonstrate how helpful the staff was a young man at the front desk downloaded an app to my husband's phone so we would not have to use the hotel phone. We also took a cooking class in their world class cooking school. Every step was thoroughly explained while we completed our tajines and Morrocan salads at our own cooking station later to eat our creations by the beautiful pool.

La Maison Arabe,TheHaydens2000 wrote a review Mar 2015,50,"A place of stylish calm, amidst the madness of Marrakech!",I'm so glad many other reviews of La Maison Arabe were really good - this place deserves them and it certainly helped my decision to stay there. My wife and I stayed for 4 nights at the end of February and we had a most enjoyable stay. There isn't much I can say that hasn't been said in other reviews but like those I would agree the place is simply stunning. The hotel is ideally situated from the main square and the souks (about a 10/15min walk) and it was just so nice to come back to a beautiful place after some dusty days walking. The owner has made a great job at blending the old part with the new and maintaining that rustic but sytlish Morrocan feel. Our room (garden/pool view suite) was very spacious extremely clean well equipment and was a great place to be and unwind. We found the restaurants to be very good the food the service and the price wasn't too bad. We had a drink (or two) in the Jazz bar on a few occasions and whilst it was fairly quiet for us it was still a lovely place to have a drink with the impecable service of the staff there (thank you). Above all else the staff at La Maison were wonderful. Nothing was too much of a problem whatever you asked for you got and their knowledge of the area was extremely helpful. My wife and I were celebratng our 9th wedding anniversary during our stay and we decided to have a hamman and massage - wow wee - it was simply amazing. The spa at the hotel is a lovely calm and well designed space.....a real getaway from the hussle and bussle of Marrakech. That evening we dined at the hotel's Morrocan restaurant and opted for the tasting menu - great idea as we got to taste a bit of everything. Good portion sizes and lots to eat washed down with some rather nice Morrocan red vino. We were then presented with a choclolate cake as a surprise for our anniversary - what a nice touch! After breakfast brought to our room on Thursday (another great touch - but having it outside is as equally nice) we decided to go for the Morrocan cooking session and chose to do this at the sister resort 15mins outside of the Medina. What a beautiful place. We loved the cooking morning and the staff and service (again) were impecable. My wife and I stayed for the rest of the afternoon and lazed around on the sunbeds by the pool - utter bliss! . I defy anyone who doesn't like this place - it's great and yes it may be more expensive than some but you get what you pay for and what we got we were totally happy with. Well done La Maison Arabe.

La Maison Arabe,SJD_67 wrote a review Mar 2015,50,As good as the reviews say,Just returned from a long weekend visit to La Maison Arabe. The hotel is pricier than others but well worth the extra money. It's in an excellent location about 10 mins walk from all the action but far enough away to provide respite from the tourist spots. We stayed in a room in the old part rather than over the pool area. Our room was great- large with its own patio area. I am sure the pool ones would be good too but the pool area is the hub of the hotel providing the restaurant for breakfast lunch and dinner so I expect it might be noisy if you are an early to bed person. The pool area is very scenic though and you would get a view which we didn't have in our room.It was our first visit to Marrakech and the experience in the souks and walking on the roads with all the different types of traffic can be a little overwhelming so it is worth finding a good hotel that isn't too far away and that you are comfortable in.,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,U.K.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SJD_67

Spa treatments are really quite good as well yet once again not cheap (the access to the hamman is not for free and must be reserved). Lots of stairs so those who have mobility issues should think twice. Reception and staff are extremely helpful though the restaurant is quite slow (it took over half an hour to have a sandwich)...

La Maison Arabe,hp9 wrote a review Feb 2015,50,Excellent Boutique Hotel,We stayed for 4 nights at this fantastic oasis of well-run calm in a hectic and challenging city. It's bigger with better facilities than a normal Riad but smaller than a chain hotel. The staff did everything and more to make the stay an enjoyable one and from the moment we got there we felt like we were being looked after by old friends. It was a cold spell during our stay but the hotel was always warm with enough eating-in space as well as lots of heaters for outdoor dining too. Our room overlooked the pool and was large well-equipped with a nice bathroom. Room service was efficient and totally unobtrusive. Both restaurants at the hotel are really good - so much so that we only ate out once in the evening (La Sultana) choosing to eat at the Moroccan restaurant twice as well as once at the international restaurant. Breakfast had a lot of choice and the chance to sample some Moroccan specialities too. The hotel is well-located for most of the tourist spots being just inside the Medina. Although that does mean you are treated to an early morning call to prayer but it was quite easy to drop back to sleep in the comfortable bed. Whilst there we also took a half-day cooking course which was well-run (Wafa was terrific) and we even made some edible lunch! All-in-all this hotel was a great choice and I'd recommend it to anyone wanting to come to Marrakesh and have a Moroccan flavour to the experience.,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Beaconsfield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hp9
La Maison Arabe,Darren P1968 wrote a review Feb 2015,50,A lovely place to retreat to,We recently stayed here and thoroughly enjoyed it.    Many positives 1 or 2 negatives.    The staff from manager to housekeeper were friendly courteous and happy to assist at every opportunity every time. We haven't seen staff like this before.    It's a hidden gem off a side street that makes you wonder if this sort of place could exist here. It opens into a lovely place with rooms everywhere. The courtyard is lovely and we have an arrival drink here as we waited for the room to be finalised for us.    Little things matter like the heart shaped cake left in our room on St Valentines night along with a rose and the use of a hotel mobile incase we got lost in the souks etc.    The room was really nice 2 negatives being the walls are paper thin so were noisy and the bed was very uncomfortable. We had a patio area which was nice for afternoon tea.    We had a hammam and massage which was brilliant and the spa area very pleasant indeed. 1 comment here - we would have liked to relax more after the massage instead of being invited to leave. It wasn't busy and we felt very relaxed so wanted to stay for a few minutes longer.    It's a great spot to dip in and out of town as you wish and it's also close to the airport. Sadly being next to a mosque we were woken every morning with the call (x2) to prayer. It's a Muslim country and its not the hotel's fault just an observation. You would have this anywhere in the centre of Marrakech.    The breakfasts were superb - fresh bread cakes juices eggs of any cooked form and the usual tea coffee and mint tea. Staff here were also excellent.    The final gem is the country club that we wished we had used more. It's a fabulous haven outside of town. Shame the pool wasn't heated so we could have had a swim and the pool at the main hotel if heated didn't feel it so was never used.    We had 5 days here and it was very special but having done this would stay outside again next time and come into town on a bus.    If they made the country club a hotel we would definitely try it.    Overall a great experience and it has to be a 5 taking all into account.    Beautiful place excellent staff slightly over priced.,Date of stay: February 2015,,"Cleckheaton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1968DarrenP

Add to that the great rooms public spaces spa restaurants breakfasts - well everything really and you've got the perfect place to base yourself to make the most of a fabulous city. We took advantage of reception organising a guide for us which is the best thing we could possibly have done to make the stay hassle-free and relaxed.

We were lucky to be staying in the royal suite which was amazing but any room would be a joy as the whole Riad is perfect.

La Maison Arabe,Redwing930 wrote a review Feb 2015,50,Wonderful Moroccan flavor outstanding conceriege,"This has a true Moroccan flavor and feel to it as contrasted to some that seem Westernized hotels with a Moroccan veneer. Good assortment of public rooms nooks spa and facility for an excellent cooking school.  The Moroccan and Western restaurants are excellent.  I prefer the garden rooms overlooking the pool but the patio rooms are also charming.  The front desk and concierge services are outstanding not just with directions and dinner reservations but a great help in negotiating Marakesh taxis and what fares are customary.  Highly recommend the book ""Shopping in Marakesh"" which details a series of shopping routes with special interesting stores marked along the way. This was invaluable.

La Maison Arabe,jules196350 wrote a review Feb 2015,50,"If I could, I would give this hotel 6 stars!!",We have just returned from an amazing visit to Marrakech.    We stayed at the Le Maison Arabe for the first time and It was truly fantastic!    We travel a lot - usually 5/6 times a year and I have to say this has been the best expereince I think I have EVER had.    From the moment we were picked up at the airport to the moment we left we were treated like royalty. I have never expereinced customer service like it the staff one and all were so ready to help and always friendly and it felt genuine they wanted us to have the best expereince whether that was in the hotel out looking at sights in Hamman or at the cookery school not forgetting the two hotel restaurants and Jazz bar.    So what were the highlights - well there were so many....    The cooking school - we went to the hotels country venue 20 mins out of the medina (lovely and calm great pool a real oasis of calm a must to vsisit - shuttles buses every hour). the cookery class was from 10-2pm we started drinking trsditional tea and learnt some of the rituals surrounding it. We then went and baked bread in the open over - delicious. We then made our own chicken & lemon tangine vegtables and salad followed by coconut cookings. There were 3/4 ladies looking after 6 of us ( 2 lovely ladies from Oz and a 2 ladies from Spain) therre was no issue with the languages all were translated. the ladies were fun knowledgable and nothing was too much trouble. We ate our lovely lunch received our diplomas and also a free tangine pot - perfect!    The hotel itself was amazing you got out of your taxi and walked down this little alley flanked with palms and thought - where's this leading and then like so many hotels/riads you walked through a little door into the hotel. The hotel has 26 rooms perfect size all with individual rooms. We stayed in a suite 245 which was great overlooking the pool area with it's own little terrrace. There are plenty of nice touches little bottle of wine on arrival cake for valentines. There is a new and old part to the hotel both beautifully decorated and quite quirky. There were plenty of places to sit either in the open central courtyard beautiful with a little fountain or various lounges. The decor is all traditional morrocan and as you walk through you will turn a corner go up a staircase and find a little fire alight or some beautifully carved moroccan artwork. the whole places exudes calm but was not stuffy. The mosque was just over the way so it was lovely to hear in the early evening the call to prayer... whilst drinking a glass of wine quietly on our terrace.    The restaurants - there are 2 restaurants. traditional and international - we ate the first night in the traditional. It had a great menu for novices and with the aid of the waiter who we conversed with in both English and French we found a great collection of dishes. We also drank the local Moroccan wine which was a great accompaniment. the second night we ate in the international restaurant. the staff did so well - it was valentines night and was crazy busy. We just went for steak wine and coffee and 'cut and ran'. The breakfast and afternoon tea which are also included were fantastic - homemade marmlaid was the best I've ever tasted!    The Hamman no trip to Morocco would be complete without a trip to the Hamman - what an amaxing expereince - we went for the roayl package - which did it all body scrub cleanse relax and massage - left feeling very well pampered and chilled. The smells and the calmness was great.    Le Maison Arabe is brilliantly located - it takes 10 mins to walk to the main square and to get into the souks and is centrally located for most things. We chose to do everything on foot so you could really expereince the life and culture although taxis and horse drawn coaches were bountiful.    This having been my first time to Morocco what amazed me was the colour the cleanliness the family culture and how laid back it is once you get past the frentic souks. The people are kind and geuinely helpful. It felt safe. We loved the expereince so much we are hoping to return next year for longer and to do the Atlas Mountains and get around to the museums we didn't have time for this year.    PS I nearly forgot... as we had a late departure and although check out is midday as the hotel wasnt too busy they kindly gave us a free room to use before we left - this was suite 222 - this was amazing and just what we needed to order some room service and chill a little before we left!,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Chichester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jules196350

La Maison Arabe,Jos dad wrote a review Feb 2015,50,Superb meal,The La Maison Arabe was recommended to us by fellow holiday travellers and were we very pleased with our visit. Like many of the restaurants in Marrakech the approach to the building is through a narrow street and could be a little off putting. Please do not be put off from taking a meal experience at this restaurant. In our view it's standards are that of top London restaurants. From entering the building you will be so impressed it is beautiful inside.  While being led up to the bar area where you are presented with various nibbles you cannot fail to be impressed with the décor and the pianist in the bar. The staff were so friendly and attentive and the food matched that level of attention. My wife and I were seated on the open air balcony overlooking the pool area. It was a cool evening but each customer had their own individual electric heater stand similar to the gas patio heaters. keeping us lovely and warm. We were gently entertained by various musicians rather magical. The menu in English was both Morrocan and International and you may select from both. For my main course I chose the Monkfish Tagine (I had wanted it for some time) and it was wonderful. My wife had Thai Chicken which was super.  Should we visit Marrakech again we would stay at the Maison Arabe (yes they have rooms) and eat there also. I had two very large G &T's before dinner my wife just one starter each main course desert wine and water and the bill including the G & Ts and 10% service came to 1500 Dirams (around £100). You can of course find cheaper restaurants but if you want real quality and would like to spoil yourself for that special occasion then you must try La Maison Arabe. They treat you in such a special way you feel like royalty without them seeming subservient. Our daughter and her husband have their own excellent Bistro Restaurant in the UK so we are used to good food served well and that sets the standards for us. This restaurant deserves to be in the top ten in Marrakech we are sure that will prove to be the case.,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,West Sussex,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blenerville

La Maison Arabe,Alison39 wrote a review Feb 2015,50,An absolute gem,We have just returned from a weeks holiday at the beautiful Maison Arabe. It's like staying at someone's private residence where you are an important guest. An exquisitely decorated maze of a building ten minutes walk from the main square and Souks with plentiful taxis if you get lost which you probably will. Restaurant food and ambiance couldn't be better and the lute and guitar players would not be out of place in a concert hall. Don't miss a Hamam at the Spa!!!    But for me like previous reviewers it's the welcome of the staff and their attention to guests which makes this hotel stand out. We were quite distressed as our luggage didn't arrive and Adil and his team tried continually through the week to retrieve it for us. It could have been a disastrous holiday but they made up in many ways for our misfortune. It's almost like leaving friends Moroccans who we will never forget.

La Maison Arabe,Milo-and-Raf wrote a review Jan 2015,50,Fantastic experience,La Maison Arabe is a beautiful small hotel. The decor and facilities are elegant and comfortable and the location is perfect - you can easily walk to all the major sites in Marrakech from here but are far enough out of the hubbub to ensure peace and quiet. The staff could not be more friendly polite and helpful - down to bubblewrapping tajines for our trip home and walking us to places of interest to us not far from the hotel but too complicated to find on our own! We stayed here for 4 nights with two teenage sons. We all took a cooking class which was held in La Maison's Palmerii location (there is a pool garden and club style facilities available to hotel guests wanting a little time out from site seeing in Marrakech). The class was hands on informative and a lot of fun. Our boys were kept fully engaged throughout. At the end of of the class we got to eat the fruits of our labours! We also celebrated new year's eve at the hotel - which was a fixed price meal with entertainment provided. Apart from the fact that there was perhaps a little too much food the meal was faultless and delicious and the entertainment was perfect. It wasnt a wild night but it was a lot of fun and certainly memorable.The hotel also has a hamman which my husband and I both used and thought it was excellent.

As soon as you walk into this riad you are welcomed with beautiful smells  smiles and a refreshing drink. You are given a guided tour of this maze . We had a suite in the old part of the building  highly recommended to request the old  Part as they are full of character . Beds comfortable  lovely bathroom products to use  fluffy towels  dressing gowns  And slippers . Every member of staff goes out of their way to treat you like royalty . The breakfast in gorgeous  I highly recommend the yoghurt and omelettes . The setting for the breakfast is stunning  outside by the pool or you can choose to have breakfast in your room. The evening meals are beautiful for traditional Moroccan food . Expect to spend around £15 per person on a main meal and a bottle of house red is around £15.00 .  We did the cookery class from the hotel . Really good fun and you eat the meal at the end of it . Not cheap  however worth it .  The location is great  10 minutes from the main square .  We just got money out from the cashpoint which is around the corner from the hotel.  We took the offer of the hotel collection which is 200 dirham. You can haggle and get to the hotel for 100 with a local taxi however I did not want the hassle after a flight.  Not great hotel for those who have walking problems due to the amount of steps.  Because it is so quiet and special also not a great place for young children as they would ruin the romantic atmosphere !  Bring a torch for the walk back to the hotel if you go out for late walks .  If you get lost in Marrakech just just in a taxi to the hotel and say you are paying no more than 20  Dirham.  Bring a jacket for the evenings as it gets very cold ....

Hidden in the Medina it has such an amazing atmosphere thanks to the beautiful building the interior all the candles and the lovely rooms. But what really does it is the friendly and attentive staff.  We played golf during our stay in Marrakech and staying in the Medina does not sound like the most convenient solution. But I can assure you that I prefer this a lot instead of the golf resort hotels usually lacking personality and atmosphere. La Maison Arabe arranged the transports and every time the bags were carried to the car and from the car without any sort of problems at all. The staff has very good recommendations for restaurants and they are always keen to hear how it we had experienced the meals. Also for the restaurants we had booked before and that would perhaps not have been recommended by them.  And the hotel has the best restaurant of them all try the La Maison Arabe restaurant that I have reviewed separtely.  I need to thank Tripadvisor for the hotel ratings.

We could not find fault with this hotel the Maison Arabe fully deserves its reputation as one of the best hotels and restaurants in Marrakech. The rooms are beautifully appointed ours overlooked the gorgeous heated pool (15m long). This was originally six riads that have been combined and they are simply stunning. There are fireplaces candles roses and fresh oranges in every corner. Rates include an enormous breakfast buffet with all homemade produce (the yoghurt was especially wonderful) and delicious afternoon tea. The staff are without exception delightful and attentive; as the hotel is not large we felt totally welcomed and at home. The location is superb a short walk away from the main sights but apart from the hustle of the souks.    The two restaurants serve superb food at prices that are very reasonable given the quality and surroundings. A highlight of our stay was the live music in both restaurants every night - really talented musicians playing Berber and traditional Moroccan music.    We took a cooking class with the hotel which was enormous fun at their beautiful country club.    What made our trip to Marrakech truly special was the guide the Maison Arabe organised for us Ahmed.

Only one comment is that I think the hotel could do a slightly better job about helping with advise on restaurants and other options in the area outside the hotel.,Date of stay: December 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Mumbai, India",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/max_d1
La Maison Arabe,Louise L wrote a review Jan 2015,50,Fantastic relaxing start to the New Year truly fantastic,We were looking for an alternative mini break to start the New Year and after much searching on Trip Advisor came across reviews for La Maison Arabe. The break was booked for 6th January '15. The taxi meet us at the airport which was organised through Riad/hotel staff where we had a very short journey to our destination. When we arrived we were taken through a short alley way where we entered La Maison Arabe and wow the start off our Moroccan experience began. The reception staff were extremely polite and couldn't do enough for us including the front office manager Adil Chaif. We were given suite 240 which was amazing and exuded a sophisticated elegance which over looked the pool. Our stay was only for four nights and we truly loved our time. Everything about this place is fantastic we wish it could have been longer. We have never come across such consistently friendly genuine and polite staff who really could not do enough for you. So if your looking for a truly Moroccan experience in a fantastic Riad style accommodation then stay here because you truly will not be disappointed.,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Clutton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/louisel44
La Maison Arabe,PutneyPLondon wrote a review Jan 2015,50,Fabulous New Year at the Maison,We spent the period between Christmas and New Year at the Hotel. Firstly the weather was wonderful and I can highly recommend Marrakech at New Year. Secondly Maison Arabe is amazing.  We stayed ten years ago as a family in the Maison Arabe as part of a longer trip and found it to be much the best option in Marrakech. We much preferred it to a Riad. In truth it is a cross between a Riad and a luxury hotel. The location is amazing just outside the medina. The building has been decorated in an amazingly comfortable and homely fashion. The building is a fascinating maze of interesting rooms both the public rooms and the bedrooms. The decor is fun and it feels very exotic in a nice way.  The bedrooms are wonderfully comfortable. The floors are heated in the winter and the rooms very warm. The bed is amazingly comfortable with high thread count sheets and the bathroom is very well lit and has everything. We had a small suite and the sitting room layout was in a kind of an L but very well laid out and comfortable. None of the rooms seem too far from the public areas.  The new addition built since our last visit is an amazing with an outdoor heated swimming pool and a sun lounge area. All of this is in keeping with the original style. The breakfast is served outside by the pool with patio heaters to tie you over until the sun gets up. There are quite a few nice areas that catch the early sun. The breakfast pancake and Morrocan porridge are highlights. I can say the breakfast is great.  The country-club is worth going to to sit by the pool and relax and the lunches there are great. It is a 15 minute mini-bus ride away but feels like another world. Its actually a big area and is very pleasant.  The staff are amazing right from the front desk through to the serving staff. It really feels like you are coming home when you get back in the evening. The front desk put a huge effort in to book restaurants for you and trips. I found the trips organised by the front desk to be good and reasonably priced as were the airport transfers. The currency exchange rate is better at the hotel than the airport!  The staff pulled out all the stops for New Years Eve. This is compulsory but is amazing starting at 7.30 and going right through to midnight with an amazingly sumptuous menu and a vast array of dancers and entertainers. I would definitely recommend this and although it seems expensive the food is amazing.  All in all I can say that this is one of my favourite hotels anywhere in the world. Thanks to all the staff for making our stay so wonderful.,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PutneyPLondon
La Maison Arabe,victoriouswong wrote a review Jan 2015,50,One of the best hotel in the world,La Maison is a unique property that I'd recommend anyone to go to Morocco and try just for the hotel. It's a riad style hotel which means it's a large mansion with an atrium in the middle with a pool and restaurant. The place is fairly large but always manages to feel cozy. What makes the place stand out so much is the over the top friendliness and service level. Everyone greets you (often by name) and offers to help you in some manner whether it's taking your bags holding a sneeze guard for the buffet or bringing whatever you want to wherever you are. People always smiled and greeted you. I've never had better more personalized service in my life and I've stayed at the Four Seasons Fairmont Mandarin Oriental and Park Hyatt. It probably just comes with the fact it's a boutique hotel with a very limited number of rooms and staff that work every day.    The staff's attitude is each individual can do anything for you. They can all also speak English very well so it was never a problem to communicate. I did notice there were only a few American staying here as it's much more popular for the French and Spanish but the staff can accommodate anyone I'm sure.    The restaurants on the property are all amazing. The food is Moroccan served in elegantly but still traditionally. The wine list is all Moroccan so you can really get a taste of the area. The two main restaurants also have live music at night which makes the whole experience even more elevated. It isn't hard to order drinks at the bar and move it over to the neighboring restaurants since in the end they all know who you are. Because of the jazz bar (with excellent cocktails) and restaurants you could easily spend most of your time here in relaxation and pamper.    My only minor complaints were related the location booking flexibility and concierge.    Location-wise this place is hard to find as it's in an alleyway. At night the surrounding area doesn't look particularly welcoming for foreigners to explore. The neighborhood isn't very clean but in the end you're getting a more traditional/authentic experience since you're right next to the markets in the Medina. Also my room (244) was located near the neighboring mosque's speakers so I could always hear the early morning call for prayer which woke me up a few mornings too early. I'm not sure if other rooms are like that.    Booking wise it's hard to get rooms since there aren't many but once you get it it's hard to change the reservation. I wanted to shave off one day of my booking by they forced me to pay the extra night even though the policy given to me was ambiguous about whether you could at least recover 50% of the night's cost.    The only thing that disappointed me about the concierge was that he/she refused to help me book things until I checked-in. That meant I may miss out on tours or other things that needed more advance booking help. As a result I had to do much more booking/planning on my own than I would expect of a 5-star property. That said once on the property they were really friendly and helpful.    I'd be happy to return to this establishment again.,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"San Francisco, California, USA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/victoriouswong

La Maison Arabe,manxboy wrote a review Dec 2014,50,Wonderful hotel with exceptional staff,I am a cynical grumpy old bugger but my gorgeous wonderful wife took me here to Celebrate my 50th birthday at the hotel the staff presented me with the most delicious chocolate cake with lit candles and then proceeded to sing happy birthday in English French & Arabic. The staff cannot do enough for you and always have a genuine smile. The Hotel itself is a hidden gem tucked away down a lane in true Moroccan style. Once inside you enter a wonderful world of understated elegance and sublime beauty; this really is one of the best places I have ever stayed in. Nothing is too much trouble. The building is an intoxicating mix of gorgeous indigenous architecture and the modern world gently adapted to make your stay even more wonderful. The place isn't built along traditional horizontal linear lines you have to walk up and down short sets of stairs turn corners open doors and go in and out along balconies to fully enjoy this tiny gem. The Hammam is down in a subterranean world of subdued lighting flickering off the gently curved warm brick with a myriad of wonderous smells and sounds to seduce calm and relax you as the staff pamper and pound the stress of modern life away. The heart of the place is a small courtyard centred around a small fountain with fresh roses floating in it as the water bubbles off the tiled floor around which you may sit and enjoy mint tea should the sun drop then step inside the lounge and huddle within the womb like embrace of the log fire sitting in comfort like a Vizier of old. The restaurant is entered through two wonderfully shaped carved doors duck if you are over six foot and enter the splendid room serving fine foods and wine. The Jazz bar reminds one of dark smokey prohibition set from a Bogey film you can sit amid the passionate paint scheme and wood pieces and imagine secretive meetings over bottles of whiskey with eyes foxed on the door watching to see who comes in. There is a Piano and a pianist most evenings and when he is absent then the staff play a fantastic range of old and new jazz to while away the time in decadent comfort. Breakfast can be served indoors don't sit out on the mesmorising balcony warmed by gas fires overlooking a rippling heated pool swathed in potted plants of all sizes look around and take in the rest of the courtyard with its trees high walls and what must be the most attentive staff in the land.    I really cannot emphasise how warm and helpful the staff are. Adil Chaif at the Front office for instance replaced the batteries of my wives' camera put stamps on mail and posted them all without charge. Raja was the delightful person who first greeted us and showed the hidden depths of this most exquisite place with a gentle smile.

La Maison Arabe,dzalcman wrote a review Dec 2014,50,Truly spectacular hotel,"I love love LOVE this hotel. Last time I was in Marrakech my husband and I ended up coming here twice for dinner because the restaurants (there are two!) are so lovely and this trip we had to stay. The architecture is spectacular — a traditional riad setup with beautifully ornate decorations and a variety of tranquil common spaces. The rooms themselves are spacious bright and elegantly decorated. It was just a little too chilly in mid-December to go swimming but the outdoor pool/dining space/sun decks are lovely.    The service is impeccable — everyone is wonderfully friendly accommodating and helpful in the extreme. I accidentally made a Hotels.com reservation for the wrong month and only noticed days before we were due to arrive (during a pretty busy period no less) — they took care of it painlessly and even ended up charging me slightly less than what I'd paid online.    The restaurants are fantastic. There are two — the Moroccan restaurant and the ""international"" restaurant (which also has a Moroccan section on the menu). Both come with live music (still regretting that I forgot to buy their CD!) and both serve excellent food. There's also a jazz bar with great cocktails. A delicious breakfast is included and blissfully served until 11am either in your room or out by the pool.    Make sure you try the hammam — it's a very relaxing (and different!) spa experience and their packages are quite reasonable.    As for location — this is pretty much the best spot imaginable. Easy accessible by car (which isn't true for most riads in the Medina we found this out the hard way on past trips) and an easy walk to all the major sights. <10 minutes to the Jemaa el-Fna an easy walk to Le Comptoir Darna and the nightlife spots and there's a really lovely street just around the corner for a quieter-than-usual souk experience (take the Route Sidi Abdelaziz to the Souk Cherifia for some great stalls antique shops and high end boutiques).

La Maison Arabe,CPHGut wrote a review Dec 2014,50,My favorite part of Morocco,My friend and I recently traveled on our own to Marrakech and we stayed at the lovely Maison Arabe for 4 nights. The staff could not have been more helpful or welcoming. Our room complete with a private balcony was beautiful and spacious. I would highly recommend getting one of the Hammam packages. I have never felt so clean and relaxed in my life. The cooking class was also a wonderful experience and I would highly recommend it even for the least enthusiastic cooks. The complimentary breakfast in the morning was delicious and far exceeded any version of a free western breakfast. I especially enjoyed the special Moroccan crepe prepared fresh for me. My friend and I quickly became regulars at the jazz bar where I can say from ample experience they make a great white russian. Enjoying a white russian on our terrace looking at the stars and inhaling the spicy smell of the city became our nightly ritual.  There were not many families in the hotel as far as I could tell with small children. Most of the clientele were older and European. However as two 21 year old females my friend and I felt very comfortable so if older and European doesn't describe you do not fear.  The location was very convenient about a 15 minute walk from the main square and the souks. Its tucked into a quieter part of the medina although very close to a mosque. If you are a light sleeper the calls to prayer may be of some concern although I suspect this would be an issue in most hotels.    Overall I would recommend this hotel to any and everyone staying in Marrakech.

La Maison Arabe,fussy011 wrote a review Dec 2014,50,"Authentic Riad, a buzz on the senses Must see, must try. If you dont stay you will be made welcome as a visitor.",We stayed for several days as guests at the Maison Arabe during November. On arrival down a small well kept alleyway we wondered how this place we had selected could possibly house all the accommodation and services it had to offer.  Set just within the Medina it is a short 10 minute walk into the centre of town.  Within a short stroll of the Riad you find Marrakesh is buzzing with local creative people providing all the needs of local residents a real feel for being in an exciting and safe place.  Every person we encountered in the street during our stay were friendly helpful and keen to chat to practice their English!  On entering the small door into reception we were greeted by friendly helpful staff the warmth and fragrant aroma that met us infused the culture and colour of Morocco in an instant and lives with us now.  Fresh Mint tea and sweet biscuits were there to greet us in the courtyard. All staff are discreet and pre empt guests needs.  Two restaurants both with typical live music during evening meals one Moroccan restaurant in a courtyard and one Moroccan/European food which is beside the pool both serve superb food. The ambience is different in each the well trained helpful staff are plentiful and always more than keen to serve. ( we were eating in the Morrocan restaurant one evening when one couple decided to get up and dance to the music the staff were there in an instant to roll up carpets and other obstructions so the guests could enjoy this in their own way).  The food in the Moroccan restaurant was superb quality fragrant with tastes we have never before enjoyed the hotel has a cookery school and a colourful recipe book can be bought. It is possible to arrange a short cookery class during the stay.  The Hammam is the best we have ever been in. A range of treatments are available in a calm beautifully designed environment. All staff are discreet once again well trained the lighting from the Moroccan lamps creates a relaxing ambience recovering following treatments on luxurious bed with drinks allows the calm of the treatments to take hold.  There is a piano bar with once again an efficient team of bar staff serving not only all the regular cocktails but those created by the bar staff.  There are many cosy rooms where residents can just chill all well decorated everywhere is immaculately clean.  The whole place exudes pampering and luxury the toiletries in the rooms are fragrant amber and orange with body lotions and soaps you just want to use.  A team of dedicated cleaning staff keep the whole place in superb order nothing is missed.  I dont think I have ever stayed in a place with such attention to detail the whole management lead by Adil deserve an accolade to their ability meet the needs of clients in a sensuous environment.  Would I go back - you bet.  While we were there we checked out some other Riads but nothing could match the Maison Arabe for atmosphere style efficiency and authenticity and location.

La Maison Arabe,Tim M wrote a review Dec 2014,50,A drink in the late afternoon,We had very good weather during out stay in Marrakesh up to the last day when it was cool and rainy. The rain started the previous evening and continued on and off through the next day. We could hear if lashing down on the plastic cover to the courtyard of the raid that we were renting. By the middle of the afternoon we had enough of reading on-line newspapers and had to get out. I had noticed the reviews of this hotel so we decided to walk by and have a look. Walking into the small lobby we at once felt the warmth of the wood fire burning in the open fireplace. We at once decided to stay for a drink. The basement bar is more a large lounge with a small bar. In the background was pleasant jazz music. We were the only patrons. The drinks were about the same as in the other good restaurants which was very reasonable considering the ambiance. We shared a Lebanese starter salad which was excellent. So if you are feeling a little run down by the Marrakesh street scene then I suggest a quiet later afternoon drink here.

Very romantic. We have eaten here on two separate occasions both last year and this year: inside the stunning restaurant and outside around by the pool. Despite it being cooler during our stay last time we ate outside and there were outside heaters which kept us toasty! I would definitely recommend outside dining - it is just so pretty.

While breakfast was tasty and spread excellent the service was not the most consistent however when I made it known they were quick to react to it.  The bar is nice and quiet and there is wonderful music played live in the evenings. There are 2 restaurants but we had to cancel reservations do to a conflict.  Additionally they run a cooking class on a working garden on the edge of town. That was another excellent experience where the master chef did an excellent job teaching us how to make Chicken Tajine eggplant and banana pepper sides as well as coconut cookies.

It is immaculately kept smells beautiful and the the staff can not do enough for you absolutely superb. I have stayed in hotels all around the world and normally there is something that could be improved on. In this instant there is nothing they could make any better. The rooms/suites are extremely comfort and look on to a exquisite court yard with a swimming pool in the middle which is kept equally as emaculate as the hotel itself.The cooking course was excellent and a translator provided. Well worth doing as you get to eat what you have made at the end. Perfect. There are 2 restaurants with the Riad offering Moroccan & French style menus. Muscic is played on an evening around the pool for the dinners and in the Jazz bar a piano player plays until 9 p.m.. All very comfortable and relaxing. La Maison Arabe has another cookery school swimming pool and beautiful gardens that are only available for residence. This is a 15 minute tranfer time and transport is provide to and from every hour at no charge. Again this is well worth visiting. We went just to have a look and ended up staying lounging around the pool on triple size lounge beds in the shade for 4 hours!! So relaxing. From this Riad we were able to walk everywhere but for those who do not like walking taxis are readily available and should not cost you more than 20 - 25 dirhams in any direction. One thing not to do is change your money at the airport. The rate was dreadful but we did not know this until we got there. In England you will get 10.7 (if you are lucky) to the £.

There is really nothing to say or to add about the Riad that has not been said or written before (positive or negative) for us and as far as this Riad is concerned the positives far outweighs the negatives – and rightly so.

From the moment you step through the doors you are welcomed wholeheartedly & sincerely and treated with the utmost respect by the attentive staff.    The riad has a real soul and despite all of the lavish luxury fine furnishings and tranquil surroundings it is still very personal. Everywhere you go in the riad you are greeted with a smile & hello (or bonjour depending on your nationality).    The spa is outstanding and the staff are excellent. On learning that we were on our honeymoon the manager asked us if we would like to enjoy a Hammam in the spa at no cost - a very generous offer and one we gladly took up. It was fantastic.    The restaurants were both wonderful; the food a great mix of traditional and western depending on your tastes and serviced with the same exceptional level of attentiveness as in every other area of the hotel.    The Jazz bar is a must - wonderful piano player and bar staff. A great place to relax pre/post dinner.

La Maison Arabe,Dabo wrote a review Nov 2014,50,Amazing Hotel and Spa,First off this was such an amazing stay in Marrakech and i beleive it is mostly due to this Hotel! They take absolute care of you before you even arrive! Airport is only about 15 min by taxi away. We used the hotel shuttle service for only 200 MD about $20 for two people. They were waiting whenwe landed and swiftly took us to our hotel. The dinner at the restraunt was delicious try any of the cous cous dishes. The menu is a bit limited but we ate there serval times and the food was great. Hotel is within a 10 min wasl to the Sooks and the Main square Jemna FNA (Something like that) and it is a straight shot to walk there. They have such a lovely staff who take the greatest care of you! Another thing to mention is the breakfast we skipped on day of it as we had an early excursion planned but WOW the breakfast is delicious and has so many choices overall an amazing hotel very nice and clean rooms (Ours had a great balcony view). Couldnt be happier. The free wine in teh room was also delicious.,Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gregdP5943YO
La Maison Arabe,Travel-Troopers wrote a review Nov 2014,50,"La Maison Arabe: When in Marrakech, look no further!","This was our first visit to Marrakech and ""La Maison Arabe"" surpassed our expectations in absolutely every way!  What an amazing place to stay!  It was the first Riad-style hotel in the city (opened its doors 19 years ago roughly) and is a true oasis of tranquility with beautiful traditional Moroccan decor throughout the entire complex. There are only 26 rooms / suites and each one is entirely different in decor and layout.    The management and staff are extremely professional friendly warm and welcoming and will do everything to make your stay a memorable one!    The rooms are spacious (we stayed in the ""Sindbad"" suite) and very clean.  We were welcomed with a bottle of red wine and rose petals everywhere on the bed towels and dressers... Such a nice touch!    The hotel has 2 restaurants of which one is a traditional Moroccan restaurant and the other is located outside around the pool. Both of them feature great food and magical decor and atmosphere! As a matter of fact the restaurants are so famous that many guests from other Riad hotels come here to eat.    This hotel has a big bonus add-on if you stay here during hot times. They have a private garden oasis with swimming pool available for hotel guests at no extra charge a 15 min. car ride away!  The hotel shuttle goes back and forth several times a day and they prepare a lovely lunch in the garden as well. This is a great place to relax after a few days of trekking around the city!    The hotel also features an otherworldly spa / hammam which we recommend visiting even if it is just to look! We are from Canada and we found the prices quite reasonable for what you get.    Since this hotel is located in the old historic part of the city ( just as many other traditional Riad hotels) we recommend reserving a pick up shuttle service through the hotel from the airport as it is otherwise a bit hard to find. This will also give you peace of mind since taking a taxi in a strange land where one does not speak the local language can be unnerving.    The souks main square and other sites are in walking distance and so is the new part of the city with shopping etc. We found the location very central actually.    We highly recommend hiring a reputable guide (the hotel will arrange it for you) to walk you through the souks!  This way you will not get hassled you will not get lost and he will help you with your purchases.    Before visiting the souks you may want to check out the government sponsered fair trade ""Artisan's Cooperative"" right across from city hall (a 5 to 10 min. walk from the hotel). They have fixed pricing and by the time you hit the souks you will know what you should be paying for things...    A word on the famous Moroccan ""Argan"" oil:  Unfortunately most of the oils sold in shops are highly purified and may have even been cut with other less precious vegetable oils...!  The ""La Maison Arabe"" gift shop sells a pure oil though!  Remember: A pure high quality oil is NOT clear may even have some sediment at the bottom of the bottle is sold in tinted glass bottles not plastic has a peculiar smell that disappears after applying to skin and is NOT CHEAP!  DO NOT buy oils from vendors in the big market square!    We would like to one more time extend a big THANK YOU to all the staff and management of ""La Maison Arabe"" for having made our stay in Marrakech such a memorable one!  We hope to see you again some day in the future!",Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Calgary, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel-Troopers

I also recommend the hammam for a real authentic experience . The hotel is Ideally located within walls of Marrakech centre a short walk takes you to the souks .this truly is a five star hotel and I feel is well worth every penny  with afternoon tea included you just don't want to miss out putting your feet up and being pampered after a walk around the city.  We also visited their country club an oasis on the edge of the city with free entry and transfers for hotel guests well worth a visit .

La Maison Arabe,L0ttiesmum wrote a review Nov 2014,50,A wonderful retreat in Marrakech,This is the one of the best hotels I have ever had the pleasure of staying in. It was a special trip for us celebrating our ruby wedding and the bottle of red wine and rose petals decorating the room were a wonderful start to our holiday. The room itself was spacious beautifully decorated and the bed huge and very comfortable.. The communal areas are great places to relax and reminiscent of interior design magazines. The location is excellent close to the souks and a 15 minute walk to the main square however once inside the Riad you feel a million miles away from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech.    The staff are efficient and very courteous. I thought the 10% service charge added to the bill for distribution to staff an excellent idea. Often one ends up tipping those staff that one has face to face contact with and those in the background e.g kitchen staff are overlooked.    I would love to return to this hotel again.,Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L0ttiesmum

La Maison Arabe,Shannon P wrote a review Nov 2014,50,Best of everything at Maison Arabe!,I can't recommend this hotel more highly!    Upon our week long excursion through Morocco we first landed in Marrakech. Our experience at Maison Arabe was perfect! It was equal parts authentically Moroccan while also satisfying the need for western comforts. The staff was so attentive and kind as soon as we arrived. We felt like we were their only guests for all 3 nights we stayed. The front desk staff sat with us for about an hour discussing our trip over the next week and helped us to get the best driver and guide that ended up taking us all over the country. The food was out of this world the accommodations were authentic safe and extremely comfortable. We were greeted with a Moroquito (a hotel original- part lime part pineapple juice part ginger) which we craved for the remainder of the trip! We took a cooking class at the hotel's country club- located about 15 minutes away- another stunning site! The class was informative and DELICIOUS! Everything about this hotel made me re-think my standards of international travel.

La Maison Arabe,TRHClan wrote a review Nov 2014,50,Wonderful Riad with outstanding customer service,We have just returned from a long weekend at La Maison Arabe. It is without doubt one of the most enjoyable experiences we have had. Its not just the fact that its in a great location within walking distance of the souks that the building is beautiful wonderfully decorated and furnished or that the food is great and that Roshid from the Jazz bar makes the consistently perfect margaritas and mojitos. Its that the customer service is absolutely second to none. The staff bend over backwards to do everything they can to make your stay is as enjoyable and trouble free as possible.    Of course there were some things that weren't perfect. It is expensive for Marrakech but then you know that when you book. The riad itself is bigger than I had imagined (not their fault!) I would definitely want a different room if we went again as our room was a little on the cramped side. It overlooked both the road outside and the internal courtyard and was subsequently quite noisy. We only had a shower in our bathroom not a bath which was a shame. But if you want to have a weekend away and come home feeling like you have a had real break and have been truly well looked after then this place is hard to beat.    We can also recommend the cooking class - great fun.

La Maison Arabe,herbie123 wrote a review Nov 2014,50,Sanctuary in the Medina,We stayed here last week for 4 nights. We had a junior suite with a terrace area... just beautiful. Cleancomfortable room. The housekeepers were so efficient and whenever we returned to the room it was spruced up and everything replenished. The hotel was a much needed sanctuary in the busydustiness of Marrakech. Authentic decor with added luxury. Both restaurants on site were delicious and service was impeccable. A little pricey... but if its a treat time its ok! The wine bar was a nice space and there was live music there most nights in fact we loved the music at the restaurants too...really added to the atmosphere. Sometimes a guitarist other nights a tradtional drummer. The spa was a beautiful area. We had Hammansmassages and pedicures while we were there! The Hamman is an experience! Buta good onewe smelt great with all the soaps and oils! We also spent a day at the country clubthe shuttle took us there in 15 mins and it was another extension of the hotels oasis... the pool was fantastic and plenty of loungers and cabanas to relax upon. We had lunch while we were there which they prepared for us and served at a table in the lush gardens... The staff throughout all parts of La Maison Arabe are fantastic i cannot emphasise that enough. You cannot do anything yourself! There is always someone there to assist. Attentive wait staff at breakfast and dinnervery sweet and friendly. Nothing seems impossible here. We arranged a guide through the front desk for the Souks after getting a bit lost the day before! It was a totally different experience and i would definatley recommend this. They'll also take you to the square at night or wherever you want really around town. We had the guide for approx 3 hours and it was 300 dirhams. (approx 30 GBP) felt it was money well spent. Quiet secret oasis the only noise is the call to prayer from the nearby mosque... which happens 5 times a day (some of which are the wee small hours!).... adds to experience once you realise what it is!

The riad is charming with it's Berber style décor. The staff is excellent. Breakfasts served by the pool were indeed very good. However given that we paid about $350.00 per night per room we felt that our rooms were small and the bathrooms needed to be upgraded. We had lunch by the pool upon arrival but our chicken dish was dry. We decided to have our other meals elsewhere.

The minute your walk into this beautiful Riad you are greeted with stunning antique Moroccan décor surreal tranquillity and impeccable service. The outside pool area is delightful. The staff couldn't do enough for you - they even loaned us a mobile phone so we could call for help if we got lost in the city (which we did!). The food was excellent in all the restaurants and complementary afternoon tea is served each day which added a lovely touch. We attended the cooking school and opted to do it at the hotel's Country Club 15 mins by car from the hotel. The course was very educational fun well organised held in a well equipped teaching kitchen. Afterwards we were able to eat our own prepared dishes in the well manicured kitchen garden surrounding the school. Afterwards we lazed around the gorgeous pool before being driven back to La Maison Arabe.

La Maison Arabe,Monty wrote a review Nov 2014,50,As good as it gets!,We learned of La Maison Arabe through TripAdvisor so it seems only fair to write about our experiences for others. In summary: This hotel is about as good as it gets.    Location is perfect - minutes by taxi from the airport and 15 minutes walk from the Jemaa el-Fnaa square and souks. Once inside the walls you find a warren of courtyards and quiet spaces. It is very quiet - you hear neither other guests or the bustle of the surrounding streets.    The decor is amazing - not just beautiful but finished with incredible attention to detail. There are no visible pipes wires cracks water marks or anything else. There are pots lamps and all sorts of other details to stop and stare at everywhere.    We visited with two youngish children (6 and 9) and a 6 month old baby. We were not the typical visitors to the hotel - most visitors seemed to be couples. But the welcome was very warm.    The room (226 - a Royal Suite) was amazing. Completely isolated sound-wise from everything else in the hotel. The showers are powerful and hot at all times. The beds large and comfortable. We had champagne to greet us on arrival and bottled water fruits and muts throughout. The rooftop jacuzzi is a really private retreat. The room was immacuately clean.    Service is exceptional and the staff are fantastic and friendly. The front desk sorted us out with last minute trips guides recommendations and everything else. Waiters were amazing. When our arms were full of baby stuff we were helped with plates chairs and everything else.    We ate in the Moroccan restaurant Les Trois Saveurs restaurant the Jazz Bar and room service. Everything was perfectly cooked and fresh.    Any gripes? No. The swimming pools in both the hotel and the Country Club were too cold to relax in but warm enough for hard swimming. But otherwise everything was perfect.    I could write and write and have probably forgotten something I should mention... But really there's no need.

Honestly no request was too great the hospitality was enthusiastic and friendly and the private restful location was a welcome respite after a long day of hard bargaining in the souks.

The place is secluded but very accessible to the ""main square"" as well as to other entry points to the souq and other major attractions.

As a travel agent I put this trip together and my clients relied upon me to ensure that their visit was memorable...in a positive way. I looked at other places to stay...including the 4 Seasons and opted for La Maison Arabe because of its location within the medina. I thought that a more authentic place (i.e. a riad) would be more exciting than a standard ""all rooms look the same"" hotel. For sure even though the 4 Seasons was probably more luxurious it wasn't more authentic and for our group La Maison Arabe provided a unique experience....one we won't soon forget.

It also has a swimming pool bar and 2 restaurants. It is well placed for the key sites of the old town close to the Souk the main square etc.    Service was faultless smiling and unforced. It's a phrase that gets overused in reviews but the staff really couldn't do enough for us right down to filling in our airport exit forms for us without us asking before we left they were without exception excellent.    There are 2 restaurants we only ate in one of them the one by the pool the food was excellent the best we had whilst in Morocco good choice including a good wine list although not cheap my wife is vegetarian and also found it superb.

We were in a Royal Suite number 227 Nahar which was perfect for our family. It had a king bed and bathroom upstairs on the mezzanine and on the ground floor a seating area and twin beds and another bathroom for our 2 children. We also had a roof terrace. The RIAD had a good size pool but we utilised their country club which was a 15 min shuttle ride away most afternoons which has loungers and a larger pool which gives the benefit of being in the centre whilst also having a larger pool area. The food was excellent but it was the service that doesn't make it quite the 5 stars. Every morning at breakfast something was missing off the table slow to clear dishes etc and during dinner one evening they brought me the wrong dish so by the time mine arrived everyone else had finished their dinner. Mistakes happen but there was no offer of not charging me for my dinner. Other things re the service including having to ask for our water and wine glasses to be topped up at dinner. That aside the front desk and concierge were great and went out of their way to ensure we had everything we needed - arranging and recommending dinner reservations and taxis a day trip etc. We utilised the hammam and spa on site which was excellent. We would recommend friends stay here as it was a lovely RIAD and if they could just put a little more effort into the service it would be 5 stars.,Date of stay: October 2014,,"Oxfordshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ExpatinCairo

They both took such good care of us from directions about town to selecting a nice wine for dinner. The restaurant by the pool was great and served both traditional Moroccan food as well as international food. All in all - just amazing and I'd highly recommend it.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Los Altos Hills, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KBish650

The rooms are super and the staff incredibly helpful and courteous. We spent a wonderful week there and have no hesitation in recommending it. It's also very conveniently situated with access to the markets and all parts of the town.

La Maison Arabe,travbud1 wrote a review Oct 2014,50,"Experience is beyond compare, just amazing",We spent nearly two weeks in Morocco but there was no doubt about which review I was going to write first. La Maison Arabe is absolutely incredible. As with many things in Morocco you have to go down a small side street to get to the Riad but once in the door it opens to a giant oasis of calm in a gorgeous setting. We stayed for three nights but landed up in two rooms. One room was even more amazing than the other. The breakfast was lovely and the various restaurants and rooms around the hotel made for a wonderful experience. However I can honestly say that it is the staff that turns a phenomenal riad into one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. I also need to specifically recognize Adil the front office manager. I have not met a more passionate manager who seems to genuinely care about the individual guests and ensuring they have the best possible time. The remainder of the staff is also exceedingly well trained and always inquiring about whether there is anything you need or that they can bring for you. Easily our favourite accommodation in Morocco but one of the best anywhere. Highly recommended - you will not be disappointed.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Toronto, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travbud1

The food in the restaurant was first class and I would recommend the lamb cooked in a clay pot to anyone.We went on the cookery course and that was well worth the fee and I have even managed to replicate the dishes we made.

La Maison Arabe,Koen D wrote a review Oct 2014,50,Most memorable stay Ever,We had an amazing 4 night stay at this Riad. The customer service was beyond exceptional. The staff here went above and beyond any expectations we had. They thought of things we didnt even think of. For example they filled out our customs card for the airport when we were checking out so we were prepared when arriving at the airport.    The rooms were beautifully decorated with colors and designs that made you feel as though you were in Morocco. The rooms were cleaned for us multiple times a day as many times we we left the room our clothes were even folded for us.    Breakfast was always a pleasure by the pool we were greeted and served as though we were the only ones there. Fresh squeezed juices fruits meats cheeses etc. all for breakfast.    The pool at the hotel was beautiful but they also own a country club. Its actually a garden with a huge pool in the middle of it. guests are shuttled to and from the country club every half hour.    overall the best part of this hotel is the customer service. they blow all other hotels out of the water!,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/koend702

It has been extended since our last stay and now has a beautiful pool with a restaurant around it and terraces with sun loungers a wonderful place to return to after browsing the nearby souks. The best of both worlds as it also has a pool set in beautiful gardens a 10 min drive away (free transport supplied by the hotel) where you can have a delicious lunch and spend a tranquil time away from the bustle of the Medina.  We had a spacious room with balcony overlooking the pool and luxurious bathroom.  The hammans and massages are second to none experienced before.  The staff couldn't have been more helpful and friendly they even gave us our own personal mobile phone in case we got lost in the souks with direct dial to the hotel if needed.

La Maison Arabe,GillianMMS wrote a review Oct 2014,50,Second visit even better than First,We visited this wonderful Riad in May this year & we loved it so much that we came back again in September & again it exceeded all our expectations. The service from all the staff was excellent from Adil on the front desk to Rachid in the piano bar & the staff in the restaurants nothing was too much trouble. We are always a little sceptical about some of the reports on Trip Advisor but this Riad deserves all the glowing reports it gets. The staff are wonderful essentially making the holiday very special. This time we booked the cooking class at the country club which we wouldn't have missed it was a great experience - make sure you have a go if you have time!. We also took a day trip to the Atlas mountains arranged by Aldi. It was great to see the countryside outside of Marrakech & experience climbing up into the mountains & the wonderful views. We would highly recommend this trip but just make sure you take sturdy footwear.

We actually arrived a day early our own mistake but the staff hid any sign of panic and gave us the best suite in the place for the evening (and for the booking price). Breakfast is huge full of choice and until 11am very civilised!    We booked late so the deal was that we moved each night. We had a system whereby we packed our cases and they moved them and all our wardrobe items. It was seamless and very enjoyable! The first suite comprised of three floors sitting room mezzanine bedroom and rooftop terrace complete with jacuzzi and area for a party of 30+!    Each room has a sitting room often with a balcony and sizeable bathroom. Decor has huge attention to detail and its own individual wifi.  8  One amazing feature is their own country club with shuttle a gorgeous pool and dining to relax after a morning tackling the souks!

La Maison Arabe,Acadia777 wrote a review Oct 2014,50,Splendor in the heart of Marrakech,This is the spot to choose if you want to feel part of the city and not sequestered at a resort. The hotel is actually made up of several old riads (houses) beautifully merged and elegantly decorated. Dinner next to the interior courtyard pool lit by candles was one of the most magical nights of our whole stay in Morocco. The hotel also has a separate location just outside of town to escape the city hubbub with a large pool extensive gardens and the larger of the two cooking school facilities. A perfect retreat when Marrakech starts to overwhelm and it means the hotel can give travelers the best of both worlds town and country. We had the most amazing suite huge and on spread over two floors with a private rooftop hot tub jacuzzi. The hotel staff is fantastically efficient charming warm and hospitable.

La Maison Arabe,DmacAmac wrote a review Oct 2014,50,Best of two worlds - Twice!,"Coming to Marrakesh gives you the choice of staying in a historic Riad or a splashy hotel. La Maison Arabe is one of the few places that combines the best of both. A beautiful historic building tucked into the medina with two great restaurants piano bar and excellent staff. Your get the artistic and architectural touches of a Riad and the choices/conveniences of a larger property.  But that is not the only benefit La Maison Arabe offers!  Ask about the ""country club."" Hourly vans take you 15 minutes away to the Palmeria and a tranquil world of gardens a large pool and lovely meals under trees watching turtles resting around a pond. Many of the vegetables used in the hotel restaraunt are grown here and women tend the ovens making fresh bread. An unbelievably tasty treat when the bread loaves come out fresh and hot. Some of the big chains offer similar choices with locations in the city and in the Palmeria. But Maison Arabe does it with style and class. The only nicer gardens you will find in Marrakesh are Jardin Majorelle.  As a family we have lived in Morocco for ten years.

The location right in the middle of the Medina 10 minutes walk from the main square is perfect.    First impressions count & they certainly did. Initially it felt like we were being shown around a private house though we were lucky enough to be honoured guests. A warmth lacking in so many upmarket establishments yet in abundance from the moment we stepped though the doors.    Our room (241) overlooked the pool the mosque in the background. A large comfy bed plenty of living room and a balcony for drinks and late night blogging...    Marrakesh is an absorbing all encompassing assault on the senses a vibrant energetic fast moving city with the Medina yet within our oasis serenity and calm.    The staff are top class. Clearly there is immense pride in providing world class customer service. The front desk team do a fantastic job in making everything so easy to accomplish. The people in the restaurants always deliver even at the busiest times with a smile that shows how at ease they are at providing such a professional service.

Don't be put off by the approach to the hotel entrance it is down a narrow lane very common in Marrakech but once you step over the threshold it is amazing. Reception staff were charming and helpful. We were treated to a room upgrade. A suite on the top floor. The downside it was on the top floor with no lift but very comfortable. We needed the exercise as the food offered is delicious with varied menus and wine list in all restaurants. The breakfast buffet is sumptuous fresh fruit pastries cold meats cheeses juices eggs any way you like them and delicious coffee. The Jazz Bar offers live music most evenings and is a relaxing place to enjoy a drink after a busy day sightseeing. Rashid and his team are very polite and friendly. If a day by the pool is needed the shuttle bus will take you to the Country Club on the outskirts of the city approx 15 minute drive. The pool is very tranquil and has a lovely pool side restaurant.

In fact I'm pretty sure it's the most incredible place I've ever stayed in all of my travels. Do not be concerned when you are originally brought to the hotel by a car or taxi as the entrance is setback from the street and it's all about the inside of the property. The service at this hotel is absolutely top-notch; everyone is fully aware of your needs specifications and reservations which I found incredibly impressive. Everyone is beautiful inside and out and eager to ensure that your stay is incredible. The restaurant is sublime. The location relative to other sites is also outstanding. And we had the most magical experience in the home mom spa located in the basement level of this oasis. The treatments that you can receive there include body scrubs massages steam bath facial and foot massage. And then there's the tranquility lounge! Add to all this the most amazing fragrances and gentle Moroccan music playing in the background with dimly lit with candles and the gentle sounds of water gurgling in the center of the tranquility room and you will wonder if you will ever allow yourself to leave. You can also take a shuttle that runs every hour to visit the offsite country club with the most incredible pool cooking school herb garden trees tranquil setting high service levels delicious lunch everything you could want for an afternoon of relaxation. The bar is managed by the most incredible bar manager who makes you feel like you are his dear friend his name is Rishad and you should definitely pay him a visit especially on the evening when a live jazz pianist vocalist performs. Then there are the beautiful rooms and decor throughout the hotel which are the best examples of Moroccan chic I can imagine. Then you can visit the boutique store outside of the hotel to buy the most amazing the Moroccan crafts gifts containers everything and incredibly great prices.

We stayed three nights and were reticent to leave the delightful strike that - truly sublime environment. When we arrived by taxi from the airport we found an unassuming entrance but as soon as we entered La Maison we knew we were some place special. We were immediately greeted by reception and effortlessly checked in and into an upgraded suite by a smiling and gracious host. He escorted us to a beautifully appointed suite with a private balcony overlooking the pool and interior courtyard then invited us for a tour of the property and a unique and refreshing beverage. As the other reviews have stated this is a first class though relaxed and unassuming hotel. The staff was truly exceptional from the knowledgable front desk to the young woman who greeted us at the restaurant morning and evening to the attentive and professional restaurant staff. Part of the whole Maison Arabe experience was the personal attention from Rashid a natural host in the setting. He took time to introduce us to not only his exceptional and exotic drinks but to unique features of the property itself. The restaurant lived up to its reputation and beyond - we have traveled extensively and enjoyed great meals - this one is at the top of our list of all time best. There is a true reverence for the culinary arts felt with each meal. The front desk staff booked us with an excellent guide for the souk who not only helped us navigate the souk and shopping in Marrakesh but made a point of sharing relevant and insightful cultural details unique to Marrakesh the city and the people.

They pepper you with mint tea and cookies their own trademark drink watermelon...without charge! While there's a beautiful pool at the hotel location be sure to take advantage of the free shuttle to their stunning garden/pool on the edge of the city - it's spectacular. The hotel restaurant is acclaimed and great as were breakfasts that included everything from crepes to a chicken in a bechamel sauce - very filling. This place is sublime...we nearly spent our entire trip here. Internet works well and is free in rooms. Location is excellent - close to the market and other sights; taxis are nearby. I cannot say enough about this place - you will not be disappointed. When we asked for a pharmacy to buy toothpaste they gave us enough to last the remaining three weeks of our trip. Cannot say enough - just fantastic!,Date of stay: August 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bologna, Italy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SLindt_12

La Maison Arabe,BTCahill wrote a review Sep 2014,50,First class from top to bottom - loved every minute,Where do I start to talk about how much I love this place? It has to be the people. Everyone I encountered at La Maison Arabe was fantastic. Upon my arrival the airline lost the carry-on I didn't want to check in the first place (but that's a different review!). I arrived at La Maison Arabe with only the clothes on my back and felt completely taken care of. In fact for my four-night stay I felt as if I was in a home away from home.    I also must talk about the quality of the facility. Everything from the pool to the hammam to the room to the restaurant was of the highest quality and every detail had been thought of.    The food and wine in the restaurant were excellent (I enjoyed both Moroccan and French fare and both were fantastic.)    The services in the hammam were wonderful (thanks Farid!).    Any question or need I had was patiently and accurately addressed. The riad even helped me arrange transportation to and from other Moroccan cities as I was using Marrakech as my central location to explore other places.    I was a solo leisure traveler and felt completely comfortable but I can see this would be a great place to stay as a couple too. I also encountered several families and groups of friends traveling together and the riad seemed to cater to everyone according to their needs.    And the location was perfect for exploring the Medina.    I truly hope to return. Frankly I'd go back to Marrakech just to stay here!

La Maison Arabe,JHH36 wrote a review Sep 2014,50,Fantastic Property and Service,We spent four days at this Riad/Hotel during our first trip to Morocco in August. I was concerned about how child friendly it would be. The hotel is quiet but it was lovely for our family. My son loved the pool at the riad and adored the pool at the country club. The food was terrific at breakfast -- the Moroccan crepes were amazing and the lady who make them was wonderful. The decor is super. My teenage daughter and I went to the hammam which was also excellent.

La Maison Arabe,SParkerJr wrote a review Sep 2014,50,"Amazing Hotel - If considering, just book it!",If you are going to Marrakech and plan to stay anywhere outside of say The Four Seasons or Hotel Ryad Naoura Barriere (both of which run $1000+/night) then stay at the La Maison Arabe.    It is a beautiful hotel affordable and easily 4+ star treatment. I chose this specific hotel after seeing great reviews on Trip Advisor and also seeing that it won an award for Travelers Choice for 2014. It met all those criteria and more.    The hotel is beautiful tranquil quiet. The rooms are nicely fitted and clean. The staff was extremely helpful and nice. Same goes for the wait staff and food - all amazing. In fact we arrived to the hotel at midnight and the staff still made us dinner. Great - great - great unexpected service.    You will find the hotel is well situated and convenient to most all the tourist sights you will want to encounter. We did email the hotel ahead of arrival and ask them to schedule a guide to take us around the first full day in Marrakech. (Picture included) - his name was Akmed and he was Awesome. Definitely recommend a guide and Akmed specifically if he is available. It is inexpensive (under $100 USD) and worth it to have someone knowledgeable of the area. Plus it kept us from being solicited by anyone and we were free to browse. He also knew of many off the path places to visit we would have never found otherwise.    In addition use the spa. Do a traditional Hamam here. Great experience and the staff is extremely professional and helpful.    I can't wait to come back for a visit and stay a few days longer.

The staff is very friendly and helpful the mint tea service is divine and the grounds are beautiful. I enjoyed the meals here but more than anything I enjoyed the spa. I spent a full day in the spa and had the works. The hamam experience is something that I will never forget. I was scrubbed clean and left feeling like a new woman.

We were treated like family from moment we checked in and were furnished with a free upgrade to an absolutely stunning Junior Suite looking over the pool. The hotel was beautiful and the food served at breakfast and in the restaurant at dinner was exceptional. We treated ourselves to a visit to the Hammam for a Royal Session and a massage and we also both took part in the Cookery Course which was a real highlight of the trip - just the two of us in the cookery school with four members of staff on hand to teach us everything we needed to know about Tagines Moroccan Salads and Coconut Cookies!  The hotel is placed about 10 minutes away from the main square which meant it was quiet and very relaxing and felt like an oasis of calm away from the craziness of the Souks! The staff were all amazing - welcoming kind funny and informative and a delight to chat to.  A truly wonderful holiday and we can't wait to go back one day.

The staff was friendly and accommodating helping us with everything from directions and suggestions to retrieving our train tickets for us so we didn't have to waste that time.    There is also a piano bar in the hotel at which we had a great time listening to a talented and friendly musician.

Very traditional Moroccan style round the whole hotel. They had a place called the hammam downstairs where I had a lovely relaxing massage and a full body scrub definitely advice to go down there.

You have the choice of 2 classy restaurants both with traditional live musicians as well as a welcoming bar.

La Maison Arabe,Eat-Sleep-Walk wrote a review Aug 2014,40,"Quiet, comfortable refuge",A quiet refuge from the heat and busy streets of the Medina the royal suites are perfect for a family with a king bed upstairs and 2 twins downstairs (with a bathroom on each floor). The 3rd floor terrace with a jacuzzi is the cherry on the top. The kindest most caring staff in the hotel are in the restaurants. The restaurant manager was particularly helpful and kind and is the one person who made our stay a joy. He offered a variety from the somewhat boring vegetarian menu for us (there is only so much vegetarian couscous and vegetable tagine you can eat!). And he made special food for our daughter when she became ill. The housekeeping staff were cheerful and hard working and their drivers for arranged rides were great. We also appreciated bell staff and security staff helping with taxi negotiations. Be aware that regular taxis will only take 3 people max. So if you are a party of 4 you will need 2 taxis. We would have rated this 5 stars if the front desk staff had been more helpful. Other than the front desk manager they were happy to tell us the way it was done and were not creative in thinking outside of the box for anything that was outside of the ordinary. If you go with a hotel organized guide to take you around the medina on your first day as we did (it was well worth it) make sure you tell him if you don't want to be in a high pressure rug sales showroom or antique store. They bill it as a rug weaving demonstration or antique visit but it can quickly become a high pressure sales event. Also at the hotel - only one restaurant is open until September.,Date of stay: August 2014,,United States,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eat-Sleep-Walk

La Maison Arabe,Enrique E wrote a review Aug 2014,50,I want to return!!,We stayed at the Maison Arabe June this year. My summary : for us it was a magical stay. We traveled from Casablanca to Marrakesh by taxi the driver got lost and we ended up very upset after being harassed by local teens the only very unpleasant episode during our 3 weeks in Morocco. The staff was very comforting and I must praise them for being the soul of the Riad. It was them that made from this lovely lodge the wonderful place it is. Totally dedicated to the comfort and well being of their guests. Each and every one of them. They were there but unobtrusive. Their advice was always correct and all arrangements in transportation reservations and guides were done to perfection.  Our room was lovely largeseparated into 2 areas with ample sleeping and seating space. Very private. More a warm and lavish home than a hotel.  This Riad has made wonderful use with the space they have very tastefully decorated generous and with multiple areas for the guests to relax. As things are in Morocco what you see from outside is not what you find once inside mystery at every step.  We enjoyed the sumptuous breakfasts which we had at the pool. Healthy offerings were plenty. There are 2 restaurants and both superb in service decor and cuisine. Or dinner could be had around the pool. The hotel is nothing but charming with much imagination. It is in our memory the only that we would think as a destination by itself.

La Maison Arabe,Andrew J wrote a review Jul 2014,50,Just Lovely,I stayed at the Maison Arabe in February this year with my partner for a Valentine's day break.  We had a suite on the first floor opposite the veranda overlooking the courtyard / dining area and the room was nice large clean and very airy; separated into 2 main parts with place to site and flat screen TV etc.    There was a good balcony. The room was air conditioned and the décor / fixtures in the room were all well maintained / clean / in good order.    The hotel itself is lovely - it isn't quite what you expect from the outside when you arrive.    The staff are excellent and attentive all seemed to speak good English. Reception was always manned by at least 2 people and they were very helpful (to the point of giving us a mobile phone with the Hotel's number stored in it when we went exploring - in case we got lost).    The veranda is a good suntrap where you can sunbathe (or lie in the shade under an umbrella) and the waiters will pass by for you to order drinks.    The piano bar was very relaxed drinks and snacks were all very good.    Breakfast was excellent as was the evening meal we had in the main dining room (we both had different tagines) and the local wines were also very good.    It isn't the cheapest place in Marrakech but I would say we got what we paid for.  our break was very relaxing and made more so by the hotel and the staff.

We were impressed by the attention to details the decor and the peacefulness of La Maison which strongly contrasts with the world outside.The Breakfast buffet was beautifully presented and hard to fault together with the two restaurants and the complimentary Moroccan afternoon tea.

La Maison Arabe,William F wrote a review Jul 2014,50,Best of Morocco,Although I have stayed at this beautiful Riad more than 5 times each time the hotel has expanded its amenities and service but has lost none of the charm and personality that originally drew us here. This has been the favorite of every friend we have ever brought with us to this wonderful country--and it just gets better and better. Where to begin? First although it had been five years since our last visit--the incredible bartender Rachid remembered us and greeted my family with delicious fresh and highly imaginative drinks while we filled out the paperwork by the stunning pool (the moment he saw me he gave me a warm handshake and told me that he remembered I don't take my martinis with vermouth--he was right I don't). Mourad at reception will go down in my memory as one of the most professional patient and knowledgeable front staff I have ever met at any hotel in the world. The piano bar is wonderful. The decor is incredible--and I would think any interior decorator in the world should wish to stay here just to be schooled in chic Moorish design. And the rooms are stunning and imaginative.  We took the cooking class at the state of the art kitchens at an area of the grounds called the country club (a short 5 minute drive from the hotel replete with another swimming pool and lush exotic setting). It was incredible and even though I lived in the country in the late 80's--I learned quite a bit from our fantastic teacher and dada. I would highly recommend this opportunity.  The restaurant is outstanding and although it is not inexpensive it is of the highest European standards in quality and safety--no one in my family has ever gotten sick--which is a huge consideration in this country. No one wants to get ill on vacation and no one has while staying here. The breakfast was incredible with all of the fare chilled when it needed to be chilled and freshly prepared for those wishing hot food. I have dreamt of the homemade yogurt and it always lives up to my best memories.  We have stayed at La Mamounia--and even though it is far more expensive--it is impersonal and Euro-dull La Maison Arabe for so many reasons is always our favorite. The Chicago Tribune recently wrote that La Maison Arabe is one of the top 10 hotels in the world for service and overall experience. I could not agree more. I hope the hotel reads my review--truly a love letter to a hotel which consistently enriches our life.

La Maison Arabe,n n n wrote a review Jul 2014,50,Oasis of calm,Thoroughly enjoyable stay. Nothing was a problem for the staff - who were ever-present yet unobtrusive (this indicates good training I suspect). Local advice proved invaluable from Reception Desk trips arranged taxis calesh arranged bags carried etc. Country Club pool and gardens are a total escape (and large enough to allow peace and quiet) with staff who were quiet and professional. Room was tidied every time we went out (!) fresh towels seemed never ending air-con switched on ready for our return. It was the finer details of service which indicate high level of professionalism of the staff. The decor and smells in the hotel are mesmerising - the hotel is cavernous and presented a dillema about where to sit each night (many many nooks and crannies with comfortable chairs were inviting). Health Spa is under ground and is the icing on the cake. Got free up-grade on our suite. Food was good but not cheap (bfast included in price). Never had bad food whilst in Morocco (ate in restaurants and at stalls in Djeema el fna). Booked cookery course and was lucky to be only booking for that day so got personal tuition. All of us had couple of visits to spa - a 'must-do'. The most important thing for me was the quietness of the hotel during the day -contrasting with the mania in the souks.

In the other direction further down the street to the edge of the Medina you will find locals shopping for everything! The Riad is a good size with great design nice pool excellent and friendly staff all round great breakfast (by the pool) that keeps you going all day free afternoon tea. Access to a country club 15 mins by shuttle with a bigger pool is very relaxing and the cooking class is worthwhile. Good hammam/spa but you can also easily find outside spas to try. Staff can arrange excursions and other services with good practical advice offered.

The comfort peace and tranquillity are just right after a day out in the city.  The restaurants are excellent and good value as is the spa.  I would not hesitate to recommend and return myself.

La Maison Arabe,Derek S wrote a review Jul 2014,50,Gorgeous Stay,Our family (two adults 14 year old 11 year old) just returned from a nine day visit to Morocco. We used La Maison Arabe as our home base by staying there for three nights then traveling around the country and then coming back to stay at La Maison Arabe at the end our trip. It was by far our favorite hotel. Upon arrival we were greeted at the door and provided with a tour of the property. Totally treated like royalty. The rooms were spacious and gorgeous all with outside space too. The hotel is a beautiful property in an excellent location. We visited the sights of Marrakech in the mornings and then relaxed by the pool in the afternoons. The hotel is meticulously maintained however if you want to get away from the urban setting there is easy access provided by shuttle get to the Country Club. The staff is completely knowledgeable about the Riad’s history and makes recommendations for seeing the area. We received top notch personalized service from both Hicham and Adil Chaif at the front desk and really felt like everyone was pleasant caring and attentive. Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Marrakech.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,Boston,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DerekS329
La Maison Arabe,seamsplitter wrote a review Jul 2014,50,Staying here will be the highlight of your trip!,"I can honestly say this was probably the best service we've experienced anywhere in the world. Hicham showed us around the impressive facility with impeccable English. At the registration desk Adil and Raja went out of their way to help us with boarding passes arrangements at the spa and helping us stay an hour past check out until we had to reluctantly leave to go to the airport. The rest of the staff was just as helpful.    Rooms were great-- good a/c internet access comfortable beds. We had rooms in the older part of the riad (213 & 214) which overlooked the garden- beautiful esp if you like waking up to the sounds of birds .    Setting for breakfast was poolside and memorable. We also ate one night in the jazz club which was less expensive but entertaining. If you can try to set aside a few hours to take their free shuttle to their ""country club"" a property they own about 15 min away. Only the riad guests can go there which means great access to a pool cabana drinks and food-- only the food and drinks are extra.    This riad is located close enough to walk to Jamaa el fna but you're probably better off taking a taxi or horse and buggy ride (a blast). There is an ATM within one block and the riad staff was very helpful in giving us change for the markets tipping etc.    Saw several honeymooners here and I'm sure they will remember this stay for a lifetime.",Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,SF Bay Area,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seamsplitter
La Maison Arabe,SurreyTilly wrote a review Jul 2014,40,Tranquil place to stay in the madness of Marrakech,We stayed at La Maison for two nights at the beginning of a week long trip to Morocco. As soon as we arrived we were offered breakfast by the pool which we hadn't expected and then given a tour of the hotel by the manager. It is a beautiful place so calm and tranquil after the bustle of Marrakech which unbelievably is just outside the front door! Our rooms were great and looked out over the pool area. At night it looks magical with lanterns and candles lighting the pool and eating areas. We went to the country club each day which is a ten minute shuttle in the hotel people carrier. The gardens here are amazing we had lunch there which was very good. The staff at both the hotel and the country club were incredibly kind and friendly. We travelled with our two teenage daughters and would recommend La Maison as a perfect place to stay.,Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,Surrey,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SurreyTilly
La Maison Arabe,Jordan S wrote a review Jul 2014,50,Paradise in the medina,We stayed here on the final night of our 3 week honeymoon in morocco.  This was definitely a highlight of our trip and an incredibly luxurious riad in the middle of the medina.  Located just a few minute walk away from the main square of jamaa el fna this place is everything you have read about and more.    Because we were travelling on our honeymoon we were upgraded to a suite which was large impeccably decorated and extremely comfortable with a great view of the pool and poolside area.  The staff from start to finish were so nice and generous. They always offered us some treat or just a nice smile and asking us about our day and if they could do anything for us.    We ate dinner there which was our last night before we flew home so we hoped for something special. Boy did we get it.  The setting of the dinner was poolside with lamps illuminating the area just enough to make it incredibly romantic with musicians setting the mood.  The food was spectacular. Traditional dishes served with modern flair. The flavours were out of this world as well. What a great way to end our journey.  Our only disappointment was that we couldn't stay longer.,Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Toronto, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JSamery
La Maison Arabe,tbose wrote a review Jul 2014,50,Best stay ever....thoroughly spoilt,One of the highlights of our stay in Morocco was our stay in Maison Arabe.  From the reception during our check-in to our check-out we had been treated with the most amazing staff a hotel could have. Rooms were spotlessly cleanevery time we stepped out..as if there was a magic wand somewhere and the moment we stepped out of the room and returned our rooms were spotless again. The breakfast was great and so was the afternoon tea and cookies added with the room tariff. Free wi-fi in every room and a complimentary bottle of red wine and water was a great added gesture. The boys in the reception were really great and helpful. And the best bit at the end of the stay was we had our embarkation cards filled in already by the hotel staff (no one has ever done that!) sooo.. very thoughtful. I recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Marrakech. Just loved the stay.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tbose
La Maison Arabe,Melanie P wrote a review Jul 2014,50,Oasis of calm and romance with wonderful food,Like many other reviewers here I rarely take the time to review a hotel online but my husband and I had such a wonderful relaxing and enjoyable break at La Maison Arabe in April that I felt I must share my experience - and finally have found the time! The hotel really does deserve its fantastic reviews. From the moment you step through its front doors from the harsh heat and the bustle of manic Marrakech you enter a true oasis of cool calm relaxation and beautiful surroundings. The hotel is a small traditional 'Riad' (built around a courtyard; two small courtyards in this case) charmingly furnished and beautifully lit with hundreds of twinkling Moroccan lanterns and mirrors.    We had dinner on our first night at an al fresco table on the balcony of the inner poolside courtyard - so romantic in the flickering candlelight. We both chose traditional Moroccan dishes though international options are available as well and the food was absolutely delicious and perfectly cooked and served. Indeed the food and setting were both so perfect that - after dining out at various recommended restaurants for the next few nights - we returned to the hotel restaurant on our last night and had another wonderful meal. Breakfasts are also served in the poolside courtyard where traditional Moroccan crepes are cooked to order as well as eggs/omelettes alongside a small but high quality buffet of fruits breads yoghurts cereals and cold meats etc.    The service is top class. All the staff were so friendly charming helpful and efficient in the restaurants and at reception where we got great advice on where to go and how to get there etc. - even on how to haggle more effectively in the souks!    Make sure to stay long enough for at least a day at the hotel's Country Club just 15 minutes away by hourly courtesy mini-bus. Here within a charming walled garden there is a large swimming pool surrounded by comfortable sunloungers parasols and gazebos. (The pool at the hotel itself is small and while you are permitted to swim in it not many people did while we were staying there. There is also a small sun deck up a flight of stairs from this pool).    Our room was a 'prestige' room called 'Dalila' which had a beautiful balcony overlooking the tiny second courtyard. It had a very comfortable bed spacious practical wardrobes with safe and was traditionally and elegantly furnished. Obviously this is a traditional building so the rooms are not enormous - this one was long and narrow but totally charming. The shower was an over-the-bath type but had good water pressure. The air conditioning was effective but rather noisy but the room is a quiet one overall and we were not wakened by the early morning calls to prayer from the town centre (friends had forewarned us to pack earplugs just in case!)    The hotel spa was also beautiful and so peaceful and I had a wonderful full body massage there.    We came home thoroughly refreshed and reinvigorated after our 4 nights at Maison Arabe - we wished we had stayed for a couple more days! THANK YOU to everyone at the hotel for making our stay so memorable. We will definitely be back for another visit next time with our teenage children too...,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Guildford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melaniep234

La Maison Arabe,LuckyPhil54 wrote a review Jul 2014,50,Too good to be true??? It's true. It's that good!!!,We just stayed at Maison Arabes for 3 nights We really never write on trip advisor but wanted to share our fantastic experience  This is such a wonderful Riad hotel in Marrakech that is a real privilege to stay at. It is a only a few minutes walk to the souk and main square which is such a colourful sight to see.  But back to the Riad..The staff at Maison all become like family.( in a good way !!)  So accommodating and amazingly friendly and so helpful  Our spa experience was magical. As soon as you descend the stairs towards the spa you feel transported into another soothing world filled with hundreds of flickering candles. The 90 minute royal hammam treatment was incredible.  Dinner was outside by the pool and was magical. The most romantic setting and great morrocan food  There is a pool country club which is so stunning. A private sanctuary away from the madness of the Souks and the medina. Totally relaxing.  We were supposed to do a cooking class there which we unfortunately couldn't do ( our fault not theirs) that looked so professional and well organised  All in all it was an amazing entry point into the world of Marrakech that we would highly recommend. In fact when writing this review and trying to tone down the amazing experience of our stay and the brilliance of this property I couldn't find one fault or reason not to stay. I feel compelled to share this amazing experience with anyone wanting to enjoy the perfect stay in the perfect Riad.,Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Melbourne, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuckyPhil54

La Maison Arabe,Robert S wrote a review Jul 2014,50,"""The Surprise is Inside""",My wife and I recently stayed at this hotel for three nights. There is a saying in Marrakech that the surprise is inside as most of the buildings look the same outside. Well what a surprise we had! This is an absolutely beautiful small hotel inside the Medina and a short walk from the Souks the square and other attractions. It is gorgeously decorated with art rugs lights furniture and artifacts. It has many sitting areas to relax and enjoy the interior. Our room had a working tiled fireplace and a large patio which looked down upon the pool below. The pool is surrounded by the outdoor dinning area which at night is lite up with Moroccan lights that create one of the most romantic dinning areas I have experienced. The Trois Saveurs restaurant is superior eliminating the need to go anywhere else. The physical beauty is unmatched and so is the service...the employees can not seem to do enough to assure that your stay is memorable. We want to thank Raja Hicham Rachid Adil Taorfik and Souraya (and all others whose name we do not have) for their outstanding service and pleasant personalities. They made our stay even more memorable. When you are their you will feel like you are home but be wishing that it was your home! I can not say enough good things about this hotel. If you chose not to book there at least go for dinner.

Breakfast was amazing and had a great selection. We ate at both restaurants and the food was wonderful fresh and not over the top in price. We visited the Riad's Country Club which had a beautiful pool comfortable sun beds and a very good lunch menu. This was a luxurious relaxing holiday.

La Maison Arabe,mpfrig wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Exceptional experience,We took our three school age children over spring break and stayed at this wonderful riad at the beginning and end of our tour. The staff was excellent - accommodating friendly and wonderfully generous with the children. The accommodations were authentic with exceptional quality and comfort. The food was delicious and provided many options to experience morocco cuisine but the staff was willing to do the little things for our sometimes picky kids. We also participated in the cooking school and that quite simply rounded out the visit learning to make tagine and being introduced to the local spices and cooking techniques. The location was perfect for walking and it felt safe and was as well marked as any hotel in the medina. We would without a doubt return to this riad and recommend it.,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Dallas, Texas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mpfrig
La Maison Arabe,nserene wrote a review Jun 2014,50,A Jewel!,Our experience at La Maison Arabe was unparalleled luxury in an intimate warm friendly setting. Arriving after a long flight on a hot hot day we were escorted into a sumptuous comfortable salon where we were provided frosty complimentary drinks made of lime mint and mango while they checked us in. Our magnificent room the Hilal over looked the garden pool which was an oasis. Huge tiled beautiful bathroom with super-modern shower fixtures. Every staff member gave kind personal prompt efficient service. Cooking school where we made bread and chicken tagine and vegetables was a joy. Steam bath and scrub were perfect as were tea by the pool and 5-star European and Moroccan meals at the restaurants. Within walking distance of Jamaâ El Fna Square. Don’t miss a visit to their nearby country club a 15-minute ride by their driver - -an oasis of olive trees herb and vegetable gardens a larger pool a restaurant another modern cooking school. We booked through booking.com which was less costly than the hotel’s website but the hotel was worth every penny. Best overall hotel experience ever!

We were there to celebrate us all turning 40. I have never felt compelled to write a review before but La Maison Arabe deserves a write up.  The riad itself was amazing. The smell - oh how I wish I could recreate this at home! the ambience the facilities. It was an absolute haven.  The staff were brilliant. So smily and helpful and professional.  We spent a day out at their sister hotel/ country club. There we did the cooking class in the morning which was great followed by an afternoon by the pool - again lovely.  We all experienced a hamman at maison arabe as well as a massage. Again amazing. I wish we had longer and could go back every year.  Be careful when leaving the road if someone comes up and says 'remember me I work at maison arabe  it's my day off'… You feel a bit guilty admitting you don't remember the face so you start to engage… but it is a scam and you'll be off to a carpet show and argan oil demonstration before you know it!,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Hong Kong, China",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hkstreety
La Maison Arabe,asterix1978 wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Amazing experience,My girlfriend and I visited La Maison Arabe for four days last week. I am normally not one to write reviews on TripAdvisor (this is actually my first) but the experience was so fantastic I thought that they deserved a little mention. I have traveled all over the world and stayed at top-tier hotels for work and pleasure. This was one of my most memorable experiences!    We were welcomed into a foyer offered complementary drinks registered and shown the property (bar solarium hammam restaurant). Surprisingly we were upgraded to a suite upon arrival with a view of the patio with a beautiful aquamarine pool. The service was top notch. Everyone from the bell hop to the concierge offered impeccable attentive service while not being overbearing.    The property itself is magnificent. If you want a traditional Marrakech riad experience this is it. Look no further. The property is owned by a French-Italian who has lived in Morrocco most of his life. Therefore all the furnishings and decor were traditional Morroccan while retaining a modern perspective.    The dinner at the restaurant Les Trois Saveurs was so nice my girlfriend and I went there twice in our four nights in Marrakech. Ingredients are high quality the setting beautiful with some traditional / unobstrusive music playing in the background. Also we highly recommend the hammam experience. We walked out of there feeling reinvigorated and clean.    Wow can't praise this place enough.

La Maison Arabe,deedeeandn wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Perfect!,I have recently returned from a holiday in Marrakech with my school friend to celebrate our 50th birthdays. We had spent 'many an hour' flicking through brochures to narrow down our choices- did we want to stay inside or outside the walls? did we want a Rhiad or a chain hotel?  We finally opted for La Maison Arabe and it was perfect. Situated just 15mins from El Efna Square it was luxurious but friendly at the same time. The decor was traditional the service efficient but appropriately relaxed.  The self service breakfast table was plentiful and catered for all tastes including a selection of homemade cakes jams & marmalades.  The jazz bar downstairs was home to a very enthusiastic barman he was very attentive and accommodating. A word of advice we found the aircon' here a little chilly and would recommend taking a cardigan or wrap if you are planning to stay for a while! Bar snacks (dips/bread/olives) or the a la carte menu were available if you wanted something a little less formal.  A real plus for this hotel is the Country Club. The courtesy bus runs every hour and after a short drive you arrive at a beautiful walled garden with pool sun loungers and snack bar/restaurant. The pool though not heated was bigger and not as cold as the one at the hotel. We really enjoyed our day here it was a total contrast to 'hustle and bustle' of the city.  I would definitely recommend this hotel and would not hesitate to book again if I should return to Marrakech in the future.,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Birmingham,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deedeeandn
La Maison Arabe,HappyHorseOwner wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Wonderful week away to recuperate,From beginning to end we cannot speak highly enough of La Maison Arabe. The Riad  was stunning and the accommodation is outstanding with standards of food and service to match. Adil and his front office staff could not have done any more for us especially as unfortunately another guest was annoyingly noisy.    The coup de gras however is the hotel's Country Club which offers an amazing tranquil environment away from the hussle and noise of the main town and madness of the souks. All in all would be very surprised if a better accommodation exists in Marrakech especially being inside the Medina walls as this makes all of the sites of Marrakech within walking distance.

La Maison Arabe,spinach_eater wrote a review Jun 2014,50,You will not be able to find a better hotel in Marrakech.,We booked this hotel for a short break in June and and managed to get a two rooms. When we arrived we found that one room was in the old part of the hotel and one in the new part. From the start picking us up from Marrakech airport to the drop off at the end they were faultless in their service level. For example we arrived late in the evening on the first night and they showed us to a sheltered court yard and provided us with a refreshing drink then showed us round the hotel. They were just so polite and kind. The breakfast is great and has fruit and cooked and prepared arabic crepes which were lovely. We decided to take a walk out and as this hotel is in the Medina area of Marrakech its really only a short walk to the souks. When we mentioned this to the reception they gave us one of the hotel mobile phones and said if we get lost just to call them up. We never used it. They showed us on the map where to go and really set us up for a nice walk out. We dined in the hotel Moroccan restaurant on one evening and it was very very good. I really have to say that the level of service and comfort offered by this hotel are among the very best you will find. The staff are sincere and really care. Incidentally please don't forget to go to their country club pool the transfer is hourly from the hotel and the pool is an oasis in the chaos of Marrakech. I was sad to leave as they were all so nice and would certainly come back here in the future. Just for info the hotel is just off the main street down a very small alley and when you pull up in your transport you can't actually see it but don't worry its there!,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spinach_eater

La Maison Arabe,Gus H wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Marveling at La Maison Arabe,It is hard to think of a hotel where we have stayed in all our travels where everything was always 'right' but La Maison Arabe does everything well. We just finished a 3 night stay there with our family of 5 and we found the experience fantastic in every way. The staff is kind attentive caring and ahead of the game. The rooms were luxurious and comfortable. The breakfasts were delicious and were made more enjoyable by the pool side ambiance. The spa provided a welcome break and the cooking school was superlative. We attended the cooking school with our 2 high school age sons and friend and all of us enjoyed every aspect. The front desk provided good advice daily on all things ranging from guides to sights to see to transportation etc. And we loved the sights and sounds of Marrakech. We loved every minute and were sad to leave. La Maison Arabe is a beautiful marriage of 1st world accommodations with an emerging 3rd world (really 2nd if you can say that) culture- a place with varied rooms cozy spaces and amazing architecture- every need met yet you feel as if you are in a boutique hotel all to yourself.

La Maison Arabe,CarlGilroy wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Fantastic Hotel,My wife and I decided to visit somewhere different and identified Marrakech as fitting the bill. The city and all it offers was great and everything you would expect to go with this break we wanted a really relaxed luxurious hotel/riad and we found the perfect place. La Maison Arabe is even better than we hoped.  Starting with the staff - all friendly and very helpful nothing is ever to much trouble. Two very good restaurants hard to pick between them but the Moroccan restaurant just had a little more style. In both restaurants the had gentle live music very in keeping with venue playing instruments such as a Sitar.  The piano bar was great and had a jazz theme going on with a very friendly head barman.  All the decor everywhere was top quality and very Moroccan.  They have an onsite Hamman I just went for a full massage - this is a must don't miss it.  Finally the 'Country Club' just a short ride circa 15 minutes takes you to this oasis - fantastic. We visited twice had lunch on both occasions and since its exclusively for the Riad guests it was never busy.  We had the Aladdin suite (Room 216) this was a great room with the outdoor veranda overlooking the pool area.

La Maison Arabe,beth1966 wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Elegant and Comfortable,This Riad in the Medina is very friendly and beautiful. Upon our arrival my party was greeted with delicious welcome drinks made by the bartender with cucumbers and mint. The rooms are gorgeous my bed was very comfortable and the air conditioning very strong (it was over 100degrees F our first day).    We tried the restaurant that night because we were too tired to go out. It was delicious and had live music. There is also a jazz bar and a swimming pool by the breakfast area. Breakfast is a delicious spread of continental style plus local fruits dates figs and prunes. They make a Moroccan crepe which is square and crunchy. We enjoyed it all.    Look at the decor for an idea of what the well made high end stuff you see in the Souks should be if you want the good stuff. Especially the silver plated lamps and bottle holders and Berber rugs. It's all exquisite at Maison Arabe.    The staff was very friendly and helpful in negotiating taxis we also loved the spa (Hammam). They use the black soap but don't scrub too hard. And the massage felt so good on my tired legs after 8 miles of walking the day before through the Medina with our guide Yder who was excellent.

La Maison Arabe,Ruth W wrote a review Jun 2014,50,A beautiful and authentic Riad in Marrakech,We stayed for three nights at this beautiful Riad in the centre of Marrakech. This was the most wonderful way to conclude our two week trip to Morocco and after staying in some wonderful places this was or favourite. The property is a great mix of an authentic Riad and a new section with a careful mix of Berber decor and modern conveniences. The staff were friendly and helpful and the food is excellent. We dined around the pool in the international restaurant each night but enjoyed classic dishes from the Moroccan menu. They also have a second property with a great pool where we spent an afternoon relaxing and taking lunch. We did not participate in the cooking classes but they are offered every day and feedback was very positive. This Riad delivered everything we expect from a first class property and is ideally located in walking distance from the Souk and main square in Marrakech.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Buderim, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RuthW590

La Maison Arabe,PilotReviews wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Oasis amid the dusty streets,"The service levels in this hotel is what you could expect in some of the top hotels of the world. The front of house staff and in particular the hotels manager ""Adil"" can not do enough for you he will book you the best tables organise trips and go beyond most to make sure your stay is as perfect as it can be.  The hotels facilities are great. The country club gives the option of a large pool you would expect from a hotel yet the riads pool is large enough for a quick dip in the afternoon. The room we had (a delux double) was more than adequate it had its own terrace area lovely bathroom and large bed it was located in a very secluded part of the hotel and have a great nights sleep.  The breakfast was good serving both authentic Morrocan and more western dishes.  At first I thought the price was steep for a riad in Marrakesh it is one of the more expensive properties but after visiting the country you soon realise if you want western comforts you should be prepared to pay western prices. So therefore after staying there and experiencing the facilities and the service received I feel they charge a very fair price.",Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PilotReviews
La Maison Arabe,Elaine A wrote a review Jun 2014,50,"Take a taste of Morocco home with you, do their half day cookery course!",My husband and I did this on our last day. We weren't staying at the Arabe but had booked their cookery course independently. The course is done either in Cafe Arabe hotel or in their other premises 15 mins away by car. We did the latter.    We were with two other people on the course so we got their full attention. The instruction was fabulous with video screens in front of you showing the 'Dada' (head chef) doing the cooking and the english speaking guide beside you helping you along the way.    The food was fantastic and you are given a lovely surprise gift at the end to take away.

La Maison Arabe,Chris C wrote a review Jun 2014,50,"I wish there were more stars to give, and days to stay.",La Maison Arabe is a charming boutique property that is in all ways world class.    Every aspect of our experience from the welcoming hospitality to the stunning architecture and interior decorating to the room to the restaurants to the spa was outstanding.    The attention to detail (at check out they presented us with pre-filled out customs departure forms) and the service (on seeing us coming in from the souk the bartender prepared a refreshing nonalcoholic cocktail and brought it to our room) is superior to many five star properties.    The location is quite central but it is an oasis of quiet and calm in a city that can be dizzyingly frenetic.    This property also represents a solid value as the prices are well below most at this level.    If I one criticism it would be that the entrance is set back on a narrow street which does not permit car traffic so you cannot pull up to the entrance. The hotel does not have hotel staff posted at the end of each alley so it can be a bit confusing at first and awkward with luggage when checking in.    PS Don't miss the chicken pastilla. Possibly one of the best things I have ever eaten.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Paris, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/870ChrisC870
La Maison Arabe,Dick74 wrote a review Jun 2014,50,A ryad with atmosphere,Make sure you're delivered to the door by a driver who knows the place because it looks unprepossessing and hidden away but once inside it is magnificent. Also check your room positioning if you are not able to cope with many stairs; they do have alternatives but the highest rooms have the most facilities and sometimes even verandahs. The Arab meal was splendid - the traditional Moroccan salads of 5 or 6 plates were sublime with (for once) the right quantities instead of a surfeit! The breakfast staff are worth a mention too being very helpful attentive and courteous. The bar was not so good - a curious custom of wanting to know one's name as well as the room number that is providing somebody is in attendance and then remembers your drink order.

La Maison Arabe,Katrina469 wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Just Beautiful,After a busy day shopping or sightseeing there is no better place to come home to than La Maison Arabe  the front desk staff are very attentive and friendly always remembering who you are and nothing is to much trouble. We were upgraded to a beautiful suite over looking the swimming pool. Beautiful bathroom bedroom and lounge area with small balcony.  There are many public areas bars courtyards and garden areas to sit in all peaceful and beautiful.  We ate at the Moroccan restaurant on our last night and even after sampling tagines from all over Morocco over a two week period we thoroughly enjoyed it and the service was perfect.    Only thing I would like to see improved a little is the quality and service at breakfast. It isn't clear that you can order an omelette which I only found out on the third day also there needs to be staff to help with the coffee machine as some guests not knowing how to use it do hold it up for others.  Staying in the Medina and being able to walk to many of the souks shops and gardens is a real plus and the personal service I think make La Maison Arabe stand out from the rows of larger hotels.  If we go back to Marakesh we would not stay anywhere else.,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Melbourne, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Katrina469
La Maison Arabe,Wfuessler wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Warm and Unique,Everything we experienced at Arabe was first class. The attention to detail was evident throughout our stay......from the rose petals in our room to the warm reception when we arrived. This Riad has lots of little hidden spaces where you can relax. We are a family of five with kids in the early 20's and they all loved this unique Riad. The food at both restaurants was very good but don't miss the Moroccan restaurant which is very intimate and has musicians playing during dinner. Everyone on the staff was friendly and helpful.    The Jazz Bar run by the incomparable Rashid should not be missed. Rashid is one of the best bartenders / hosts that I have seen. He is a huge asset to Arabe as he is really like an ambassador for this Riad. He is everywhere and has a great way about him.    I used the spa for a massage and once again this is well worth it. Quiet serene and professional.    Only issue we experienced was the internet.....which was a recurring theme throughout our stay in Morocco. But that is really not too important.    We would definitely recommend Arabe. You will not be disappointed.,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Wantagh, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wfuessler

It was a triplex with salon on the ground floor (which can be converted into a bedroom at night with its own full bathroom) a master bedroom with a full bathroom on the 1st floor and a lovely terrace with a hot tub on the top floor. The riad itself is lovely with a lot of character. Serves wonderful food which you can have in their courtyard by the pool. The front office manager  Adil was very helpful and hospitable. Service is impeccable. We had massages in their hammam on both days and they were great. They also have their own country club on the outskirts of town with a shuttle service. We did not try that.

La Maison Arabe,Kathy53945 wrote a review May 2014,50,Truly Incredible,Never have I stayed at a hotel which so strongly reflected the beauty and craftsmanship of a country. From the tile floors to the moorish archway the carved wood headboard to the Berber rugs the recessed lights in the shape of the star of Solomon to the brass lamp hanging from the wall of the small terrace every aspect of the room reminded us that we were in Morocco.    The cooking class was really fun. Because the group was larger than some it was held at the hotel's country club about 20 minutes away. The group ate our lunch in the beautiful garden which was lovely. Had we known that the class would be there we would have brought along our swimming suits to stay by the pool and relax after lunch. If you sign up for a cooking class inquire that day about whether the class will be held at the hotel or at the country club.,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Wernersville, Pennsylvania",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kathy53945

We read all the reviews on trip advisor and we were delighted that all the glowing reports were more than accurate.    Our stay at the hotel really helped to give us a truly authentic experience of Marrakech. We ate in both the Moroccan and the International restaurants and the food was amazing and we were surprised by the quality of the Moroccan red wine. What impressed us most was the staff – warm and friendly and real professionals. The service provided was excellent.    Reception staff ( exceptional) arranged a guide for a morning tour which gave a fabulous insight into the history of Marrakech. I highly recommend a Hammam treatment in their spa and do try the wonderful crepes at breakfast. Visited the Jazz Bar most evenings after a busy day where there was always a warm welcome and some great cocktails.    Without doubt we will be going back to stay again to discover more of Marrakech and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it - just hope the Riad isn’t fully booked !,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Devon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GillianMMS

La Maison Arabe,ZinC369 wrote a review May 2014,50,The only thing missing was a magic carpet ride!,In early March my romantic husband whisked me away for a weekend in Marrakech. He thoroughly researched the city the restaurants and the hotels.    He decided on a traditional riad in the heart of the city as opposed to the modern concrete and glass hotel chain option.    A riad is a Moroccan house or palace built around an interior garden or courtyard. They are designed as a family home. All the rooms face the courtyard atrium or the garden. Riads are peaceful tranquil and luxurious with fountains and lush landscape.    La Maison Arabe embraces all of the above.    The welcome we received upon arrival made us feel like royalty. Their entire staff is dedicated to ensuring your stay is memorable and enchanting.    We were escorted into one of the many courtyards where we were offered a refreshing and cool drink and allowed to relax from the short journey from the airport where a car was waiting for our flight to arrive. After that we were given a tour of the impressive grounds spa restaurants lounges and finally our sumptuous room – fit for a king and queen!    The bedroom was to die for I came home wanting to redecorate ours “Moroccan Style”! The bathroom was enormous and filled with exquisite toiletries of bath body and hair oils. Bathrobes that swathed you in thick and absorbent cotton towels as big as tablecloths bathtubs big enough for two if you are so inclined (!).    Our room had a roof terrace that offered a cool place to enjoy a glass of wine or view the city lights twinkling in the clear night sky.    We had breakfast al fresco at poolside with fresh fruits beautiful breads an omelet bar and pastries. La Maison Arabe is a short walk from the Souk where bargains can be found if you like to haggle and we do!    We had the most amazing dining experience in the riad’s traditional Moroccan restaurant Le Restaurant Les Trois Saveurs (The Three Flavours); Moroccan French and Asian. The teardrop lanterns that guided our entrance into the dining room added to the ambience of such an exotic atmosphere. The red ceiling and plush furnishings added to the entire experience.    We dined on the finest of food rich with novel ingredients outstanding table service and superb presentations. Whilst enjoying a feast of lamb tajine traditional Moroccan music by a variety of performers discreetly played in the background.    We took advantage of the Wellness Centre too and treated ourselves to a cleansing session of a traditional Moroccan hammam (Turkish bath) that starts with a relaxation room. We were then given a full body wash our skin was then covered with a scented rock salt. The flow of hot dry air allowed us to perspire freely. We were then rinsed off moisturized and I felt like I had brand new skin! Bliss!    I could go on but you get the idea. The only thing La Maison Arabe didn’t offer was a genie in a bottle!    But I got my wish an unforgettable stay in an extraordinary city at a magnificent venue that values their clientele.,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZinC369

We arrived not really knowing what to expect and waited in the beautiful courtyard of the riad before being driven to their 'ranch' just outside the city. This place was as beautiful as the riad itself; beautiful gardens shaded outdoor tables and a modern kitchen well enough equipped for a tv cooking show. Wafa was a great host and she told us all about Moroccan culture and history before hosting the course with the Dada.

So for comparison purposes between Kniza and La Maison Arabe I think it comes down to size! If you like a large hotel with facilities then choose La Maison.

The fittings and décor are high quality and the whole place has a luxurious feel without being brash. The restaurant is excellent.    Worth a particular mention are the staff: the front desk is VERY good. Helpful capable professional and completely service oriented. Not one member of staff gave the sense that they were just doing a job. Every one excelled from the cleaning staff to the restaurant staff to the doorman.    We are light sleepers and found the call to prayer obtrusive. We were moved (upgraded) without hesitation and had wonderful sleeps after that.

We travelled with a baby and were upgraded to an amazing suite on top of the house with a number of rooms and terraces to give us plenty of room and the sun all day if we wanted. We did say after the first night that the suite patio side was a bit noisy for us as had two windows either side looking out on the street. This room was still gorgeous but they upgraded us- no questions and were really nice about it as we felt bad saying anything but wanted a more relaxing experience on holidays. The food is also fab and they recommended some great local restaurants for us to eat. The riad is only a short walk to the souks and central square and just a haven away from the bustle of an amazing city. Do try their out of town club if you want a big pool and to sun bathe. Also the spa is great with prices much cheaper than home!

Reccomend using the hotel taxi service to & from the airport. The hotel staff were very kind & booked our taxis agreeing prices before we got in.  Rooms were very clean with fresh flowers & towels daily.  Had a wonderful time tried local restuarants which had music & entertainment.  Pool was cold but sunbed area great with luxury sun longers.

La Maison Arabe,JoelMcC wrote a review Apr 2014,50,Once again fantastic stay at La Maison Arabe!,Following our amazing time last year we were keen to return this year. We had another truly memorable 7 night stay. The suite Jafaar was incredible. A double bed for our 13 year old daughter on a raised platform a single bed for my son in the living area and a separate bedroom for my husband and I. Plus we additionally had our own private courtyard with two loungers and two chairs which was a lovely space for a bit of peace and quiet.    Front desk assistance whether its booking a table at one of the hotel's excellent restaurants taxis to the airport trips to the desert or recommendations on where to visit was superb. Charming and efficient service with a smile thanks to all.    We spent many a day at the Country Club where the charming service provided by Mohamed and outstanding meals eaten by the pool were a highlight and a wonderful contrast to the buzz of Marrakech.,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmcc1969

La Maison Arabe,Toochy wrote a review Apr 2014,40,Marrakech Paradise,"This is a wonderful hotel and I definitely recommend it. Because of its 5 out of 5 Tripadvisor rating I expected it to be perfect and that may have set my expectations too high. I really want to give it a 5 out of 5 but it missed the mark slightly on a couple of occasions.    It is beautiful inside - truly a paradise when faced with the chaos of the city. We had a suite that overlooked the pool and it was a gorgeous room. The only thing we were awaken by the call to prayer from the nearby mosque every night. I assume that you'd hear the same from any hotel in the city.    I took a cooking class offered at the hotel and it was wonderful. Since there were so many of us signed up for the course they held it at their ""country club"" facility where they have a state of the art learning kitchen. I learned how to make a chicken and preserved lemon tagine as well as two delicious vegetarian starters and then we all sat down together to eat our delicious Moroccan food. I highly recommend taking this cooking course.    The hotel owns property in another part of the city and they call it the ""country club."" It is a beautiful garden (with lily pads frogs and turtles) and pool hidden behind a gate. The hotel runs an hourly shuttle  to the property and you must go there at least once. We enjoyed the sunshine laying by the pool and ordered some freshly squeezed orange juice. This was served to us and tasted salty so we sent it back. They brought us another and this was even saltier than the first. Someone must have mixed up the sugar and salt containers!    The spa is lovely and relaxing although we had a disappointing time at first. My daughter and I went for massages and they thought our appointment was for 30 mins when we were expecting an hour and tried to just add on another 30 minutes but that doesn't work when it has been stopped in the middle of what is supposed to be a relaxing a massage. Also they did not show us all the oil choices as their brochure said they would. Basically they did not take the time with us that they say they will. When management got wind of our dissatisfaction they immediately offered us massages the next morning and did not charge us for either massage. This was greatly appreciated. My ""make up"" massage was probably the best massage I've ever had.    We ate at the restaurant pool restaurant a couple of nights and the food is really good. One night we ate in the Jazz club and this was a fun and relaxed way to have dinner. Rachid our server was outstanding. He even made my daughter a special elixir of honey and ginger to help with a bad cough she had. He went above and beyond! There was one waiter we had at the pool restaurant who was terribly unfriendly and unhelpful and this left a sour taste in our mouths. Perhaps this was also a language thing but there were plenty of people who we were unable to communicate with fully but they still had a smile and tried to be as helpful as possible.    I should also mention that upon our arrival the manager saw that we could get a better rate on one of our rooms and he immediately made that change for us. This was greatly appreciated especially because it was completely the hotel's doing.    Please stay at this beautiful hotel. Just know that nothing is perfect and in Marrakech it can be a struggle to be understood if you do not speak French or Arabic (Or even better - Berber!). So to sum up: we are really happy that we stayed at this lovely hotel but there were several small issues that made it hard for me to give it the 5 out of 5 that I was hoping for.",Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Los Angeles, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Toochy

They don't advertise their pool and gardens on the other side of town. A shuttle bus takes you there and you enter paradise. Again everyone wants to please.

Staff were incredibly helpful and courteous offering us a welcome drink on arrival  a tour of the hotel and then on our 2nd day a complimentary upgrade to a room with a private balcony including sheltered patio. Rooms were comfortable and luxuriously furnished breakfast delicious although the coffee was a bit weak! We went to the country club twice during our stay which was also amazing  pool very clean. Hotel also sorted out our bus tickets for us for the onward journey to Essaouria and negotiated a good rate with the taxi driver for us. If I had to give any negatives? The Jazz bar piano player couldn't really sing and the night we ate in the Moroccan restaurant we found the staff there a bit less helpful and smiley. They were still pleasant enough. Meal was good but not outstanding. We really enjoyed our stay overall and would not hesitate to recommend it to others.

We had a mini-suite overlooking the pool and restaurant - it was beautiful very comfortable and well appointed. The food was excellent - we had the Monkfish Tagine twice as it was a truly superb dish. One day we went to their 'County Club' (a 20 minute free bus ride away) - entry was free for hotel guests. On arrival we were provided with a hat towels and a complimentary drink. The gardens and the pool were wonderful - the lunch was delicate and beautiful served amongst the trees. The hotel's location was excellent less than ten minutes walk (through truly Moroccan streets) to the main square and the Souks. However the best thing about La Maison Arabe was the staff - they were always on hand to offer advice and assistance and always with a smile. They arranged a trip to the Atlas Mountains for us as well as an evening meal in a restaurant overlooking the main square in Marrakesh (a place definitely not to be missed both during the day and in the evening). I am not an expert on Spa's - but we went and it was an experience not to be missed. We had a memorable four day break that we will repeat.

We were extremely satisfied with the hotel: Top location; very elegant interior with lots of beautiful Moroccan art and antiques and excellent restaurants. Our very fine deluxe rooms on the second floor had bconies overlooking the pool. The hotel staff is outstanding in their friendly hospitality and professionalism. An example to illustrate this: One afternoon a written message told all guests that due to constructiion work in the neighbourhood (completely out of hotel control) there was a risk that the hotel the next day would be without electricity 4 hours from 9 AM to 1 PM. Accompanying the message was a bottle of French champagne in a cooler.

La Maison Arabe,Iain B wrote a review Mar 2014,50,Wonderful hotel,My wife and I stayed at La Maison Arabe for 3 nights before going out for some nights in the Atlas mountains. I do lots of international travel globally for my work but I really cannot speak highly enough of this hotel - for individuality cleanliness service and food quality it is almost certainly my number one hotel. We arrived in the evening and were picked up by the hotel car to take us to the hotel. The arrival is a bit disconcerting as you park on a roadside in the city and the staff take you down a narrow lane to the hotel entrance which is very low key and you may think what have you come too. However on entering the hotel lobby you enter another world of charm traditional furnishing and luxury hidden away from the bustle of Marrakech's narrow lanes. The staff welcomed us with refreshing drinks whilst we checked in. Our initial room was absolutely fine but unfortunately we had some noisy neighbours above us which woke us with footsteps at 1230am and then the same plus running baths at 6am so our first nights sleep was not great. We mentioned this at reception as we thought we may be below staff quarters but this was not the case- just other less considerate guests. To my amazement when we came back from touring the city that afternoon we were met by the hotel manager who offered us an upgrade to a suite which he showed us around first. A beautiful room (212) with loads of space character and a delightful balcony over a quiet internal courtyard. We ate in the Trois Saveurs restaurant which is located beside the small swimming pool - the same restaurant is used for breakfast. Food was fantastic as was the food in the Jazz Bar - we did not get the opportunity to eat in the more formal Moroccan restaurant but I suspect that would be very special too. We used the offsite Kasbah club which has a lovely garden pool and bar/food facility- it is about 15 minutes by free shuttle and is great relaxation away from the bustle of the city. When we returned to the  city after 4 nights in the Atlas mountains I rang La Maison to ask if we could store our bags during the day as we had a late flight - again the service was fantastic as the manager met us on arrival and the reception staff remembered our name and suite number. All in all a truly magical experience - sorry this is such a long review but we were totally blown away by this place.

La Maison Arabe,ChrisWoottonBassett wrote a review Mar 2014,50,"Exquisite Riad, Perfect Service",My wife booked a 3-night stay at La Maison Arabe as a birthday surprise for me -- she couldn't have chosen a more perfect hotel. From the moment the porter stepped up to take our bags as we approached somewhat nervously down the unassuming alley we experienced the most professional discreet and yet friendly service from all the staff. Having been greeted with a welcome drink in the delightful Salon de The courtyard we were taken on personal tour of this intimate and beautifully appointed riad culminating in the introduction to our fabulous courtyard suite adorned with scattered rose petals. We couldn't wait to experience the luxurious spa and booked in straight away -- I'd personally recommend the Beldi hammam and massage session as the perfect way to spend a couple of hours unwinding. We ate in both the traditional Moroccan and modern Les Trois Saveurs restaurants during our stay and both excelled in service and quality. At breakfast the staff were so attentive and friendly that we immediately felt like regular visitors who'd been coming back for years. It's hard to tear yourself away from such an excellent hotel but being located right in the Medina just a few minutes' walk from the souks you don't have to venture far. One final highlight was the sophisticated Jazz Bar where we relaxed in the evenings sipping personalised cocktails soaking up the cool jazz wafting from the pianist and imagining Hercule Poirot wandering in accompanied perhaps by an American heiress ...,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Royal Wootton Bassett, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisWoottonBassett
La Maison Arabe,Tripper43 wrote a review Mar 2014,50,"Stunning property, amazing service",After many hours of research we decided to stay in the medina in a traditional riad. With many wonderful options to choose from my friend through in a last-minute request for a proper pool to swim lengths in. La Maison Arabe seemed like the obvious choice and I'm very happy we chose it. Close to the edge of the old city it's easily accessible being only 50 yards or so from where the taxi we arranged through the hotel stops. We were greeted by the first in a long line of charming and helpful staff who took as through to the internal courtyard to drink sweet tea and eat biscuits while we checked in. We were then taken to our room which was spotless beautiful and certainly the most characterful i've ever been in (it has a tagine-shaped wall at the heart of it.). I never saw any of the more expensive rooms (ours was the cheapest) but I imagine they're pretty special.    We had lunch by the pool every day except one when we decamped to the country club and dinner one evening. The atmosphere is very tranquil no doubt romantic with the right companion. We took advantage of the hammam and booked a guide to take us round the souk. Not being culinary types we didn't book a cookery class although we met a few who did and they all seemed both very impressed and to be enjoying themselves.    The setting is beautiful a true haven in a chaotic and noisy city. But the staff are exceptional. Tips are built into the final bill and richly deserved. whoever manages this place hires very well and has done a great job to deliver a wonderful guest experience.

All kinds of goodies were offered as well as omlets fried eggs etc. We went for dinner at one their restaurants the morrocan one and ate a leg of lamb to die for. The staff was always attentive to every one of our needs to the point of having their porter take us to the corner to pick up our pick up vehicles. My wife is campaining all the family to go Marrakesh next year. Obviously to stay at this exceptional RIAD.,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Recife,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdwardS49
La Maison Arabe,Simona P wrote a review Mar 2014,50,Utter bliss,Visited La Maison Arabe Spa on the last day of my trip to Morocco this week! I went with a good friend of mine and we thought we'd indulge after hours of relentless (and amazing) sightseeing! We chose a Hammam treatment with Gommage followed by a massage. The place is just beautiful and you are instantly immersed into a relaxing aromatic atmosphere guaranteed to soothe. If you are having a massage you can pick your oil out of a delightful selection they will have laid out for you. They will also explain how everything will work.    The Hammam is essentially a really good sauna the Gommage is a really good scrubbing and you also get a lovely hairwash so you are squeaky clean and relaxed. The massage was lovely very soothing and just the right pressure but they will ask you if you prefer harder or softer.    We chose to have a mint tea in the internal courtyard afterwards and it was delightful with traditional biscuits and the service was ever so attentive. There is also WiFi so if you want to pop a photo on Instagram or tweet about it all - you can do!    I would definitely recommend La Maison Arabe if you are after a touch of luxury at what really is amazing value!!,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Brighton, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/111SimonaP

La Maison Arabe,Joy B wrote a review Mar 2014,50,A Hidden Treasure in the Heart of the Medina,We had arranged for a taxi to pick us up at the airport and take us straight to the Riad. It dropped us at the end of an alleyway and we wondered what we were in for! As we were later to find out the Riad as with many other buildings in Marrakech revealed behind the walls was a superb hidden oasis! We were warmly welcomed by the manager and because we were a little early for check in were treated to refreshments in one of the lovely courtyards. We were shown around the entire Riad and then to our room which had a balcony overlooking the pool and outdoor restaurant. The room was perfect clean and welcoming. Plenty of room with the bathroom more than adequate. All the of the staff couldn't have been more friendly or helpful. they gave us advise on sightseeing and travelling around the town and they arranged a super trip for us up into the Atlas Mountains. There are two main restaurants one serving traditional Moroccan fare and the other a variety. All the food in both restaurants were delicious. The Riad has a traditional Hammam and spa do try it it's superb! There are a couple of bars and every evening we were there there was a pianist in the jazz bar a great start to any evening activities! The Riad has a country club about ten minutes away and we spent a day there. Maybe because of the time of year we were the only ones there! It has a larger pool although not heated. We had lunch laid on for us and were waited on though out the day with refreshments. I would highly recommend this wonderful gem well worth the stay.,Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sherborne, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joyb732
La Maison Arabe,TimmyTraveller wrote a review Mar 2014,50,Great stay - again,This was our third stay at La Maison Arabe and once again the beauty of the place and the quality of the staff continue to impress. All the other reviewers who praise this hotel rightly identify what it is that makes people love it. It truly is an oasis in the chaos of Marrakech and there isn't anything the staff won't reasonably do to make your stay more comfortable. They really are terrific. The management have made a couple of changes that we personally didn't like to do with the patio area where they have constructed private verandahs which now occupy the space where a lovely little patio existed previously and we didn't think the menu in the Trois Saveurs restaurant was as varied as it could have been. That said the food was excellent and the hotel's country club garden was wonderful once again.

La Maison Arabe,Eliju13 wrote a review Feb 2014,50,Adil is amazing,I know I am late to comment but all I can say is wow. We were greeted and taken care of by a great Guy Adil. His customer service is impeccable. He had a smile at all time. He did his best to accommodate us. The riad was in the old medina and we were going to go for palais de congress but after My husband and I and the kids met Adil we changed our mind. He took the time to give us a tour and also to explain every little detail about the riad from the artwork to the wood work. We were so thrilled that we cancelled our reservation to stay here. We were not disappointed he kept checking on us and even the kids loved him My Julie and Elias kept asking where is uncle Adil. My hubby was hesitant in the beginning but once he saw that Adil kept his great service he made sure that we will make this place our gateway place from now on. I had to thank him and the rest of the staff. Keep up the great work.

La Maison Arabe,KP09SLP wrote a review Feb 2014,50,Hidden Gem in the Medina,Don't be put off by the approach from the road! This is a truly gorgeous character hotel in a great central location in the Medina which gave us the flavour of Marrakech we wanted combined with making life easy for us as first time visitors so that we explored and did all we wanted to do without feeling that we had been ripped off. From our welcoming and very personal check-in while sat on sofas enjoying the peace and beauty of one of the many candlelit courtyards with free welcome drinks after the busy and hot wait to go through Passport Control at the airport the staff generally were excellent and very kind. The excellent staff at reception got to know us personally very quickly and were particularly helpful - they responded to every request with immediate attention and helped us to see what we wanted organising a lovely driver to take us on a personally devised tour out of Marrakech and for a horse drawn caliche (requested with well treated and fed horses only) at only a little more than the going rate which after all is a few pounds extra at most so took the hassle out of trying to find decent people and negotiate and all done at short notice which meant we had experienced and nice people to show us the sights. Equally when we wanted to explore on our own they gave us every help to do so easily. The hotel itself is an oasis of peace and the architecture is beautiful so it is incredibly relaxing especially at night with candles lit everywhere. Our 10 year old daughter is Type 1 diabetic so travelling means extra pressure in relation to having the right type of food when we need it if she has an unexpected hypo (low blood sugar)and everyone could not have been kinder or more helpful bringing us hot milk and biscuits quickly at any time of the day or night. Having the Spa on hand there was great for treatments when the weather let us down and the Country Club was a nice extra although sadly the weather was more cloudy than sunny during our time there. Our suite - The Chem - was superb and we had a lovely roof terrace with hot tub and views of the Atlas Mountains and the Katoubia but they kindly lit a fire in the fireplace of our sitting room in the evening when it was chilly so it was also cosy. All in all we made the best use of our room and the hotel facilities from anywhere we have stayed and although we are lucky enough to have stayed at some lovely luxury hotels this was one where they did not seem to be trying to get every last cent out of you. The staff gave my husband a lovely Birthday serenade cake and drinks without being told it was his Birthday made my daughter a chicken sandwich for the airport when I asked what was there and mentioned I was worried about the timing of our flight in relation to her meals and would not take any payment and translated a letter into French for me to give security at the airport explaining about her radio controlled insulin pump which cannot go through the X-ray scanner. The hotel atmosphere seemed genuinely personal and all about the well-being of the guest with all but a very few of the staff wanting to give the best service to its guests and make their trip the best it can be. We would genuinely say this is a great place with lovely food that lives up to all of its good reviews and more and we are so happy we chose it. It is truly lovely.,Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Horsham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KP09SLP

We had an airport pick up which I would recommend then we were welcomed by all the staff and whisked off for a delicious welcome cocktail - Virgin mojito I think - prepared by Rachid the talented head barman.    Our pool view suite - Nars - was spacious and beautifully appointed. Wifi was brilliant.    Breakfast round the pool was so pleasant. The fresh juices are delicious and really recommend the Moroccan ""pancake"". Enjoyed drinks in the jazz bar before dinner in the Moroccan restaurant which was a real highlight.

Excellent location just at the gate of Medina and walking distance to major sights and restaurants so after soaking up the city we can quickly walk back to the hotel/riad and freshen up. For me the hotel gives even more Moroccan feeling than outside on the streets. The interior is authentically and beautifully decorated doors and drawers in real leather rooms are very cozy and overall the hotel exudes elegance. Most importantly the staff and service are tip top! They anticipate your every needs from making up rooms EVERYTIME you go out to organizing excursions or even just taxi services. The in-house cooking workshop was also nice especially the chef/dada.

It was our first time to Morocco The hotel is beautiful it was our anniversary and the manager kindly upgraded the room the room was spacious with a very nice bathroom & small outside area to sit. We booked the cookery class I feel this is a must do it was so much fun & we learnt so much about Moroccan cuisine. The hotel is situated within easy walking distance for Koutoubia Mosque & Jemaa el Fna we also visited the stunning Majorelle Gardens. We found the hotel very relaxing The Jazz Bar is great of an evening asked Rashid to make one of his lemon specials. We went to the Moroccan restaurant in the hotel serving very authentic cuisine which was superb. Breakfast was taken by the delightful pool area again the food was great you must try the Moroccan pancakes with home made jams.

The room was spledid with a private terrace and whirlpool tub which allowed us to relax in solitude and enjoy the sun for a few hours each afternoon after walking through the medina. The location was perfect - not too far from everything but quiet and tranquil within the walls and courtyard of the property. The food at the two restaurants was of very good standard and the staff were always attentive and accommodating. The restaurant recommendations were very good as well.

Marrakech has no shortage of upscale hotels but it will be hard to topple the experience of this small Riad. From welcome drink to check-out we could not find any fault in this magic place inside the walls of the medina. There are many well appointed public spaces to relax and forget the outside world. The food was great and the breakfast buffet extensive but the best was the staff dedicated to service with a smile.

La Maison Arabe,TheLadyinRed03 wrote a review Feb 2014,50,One of the best places I've ever stayed!,This was our last stay on our Morocco trip and what a wonderful way to end the trip. Everything from our room to the service to the food were beyond fault.    We stayed in the Noor Suite which was huge with two terraces. The room was absolutely lovely.    We could not have been more impressed with the breakfasts which had an array of options to choose from. What I loved most was the woman who made crepes to order with various ingredients. Those were SO amazing.    We were here for New Year’s Eve and loved the party they organized with a tasting menu/wine pairings and lots of traditional musicians. At midnight the entire staff came out to the patio with drums singing and chanting. It was special to be a part of their celebration.    The service was superlative. They provided us with a mobile phone to take with us when we were sightseeing in case we needed to call them for anything. They arranged and rearranged our dinner reservations. And they were always friendly and helpful. One employee in particular spoke to my husband in Russian (as he is married to a Russian woman): I’m so sorry I don’t remember his name but if someone from the hotel reads this please commend him because he is a terrific part of your team.    In short it takes a lot to impress us and we thought this riad was fantastic.

La Maison Arabe,Julia M wrote a review Feb 2014,50,A hidden gem,We were recommended the restaurant of La Maison Arabe by a fellow guest at our Riad and we were not disappointed. Although we weren't staying here we could see how well appointed the hotel was and we were treated like honoured guests just coming for a meal. The choice on the menu was excellent as it took into account people weary of tagines and brochettes and the little lights given to help read the menus were a nice touch as the restaurant is quite dark. That is not a complaint by the way - the ambience is delightful. Just keep in mind though that this is going to be more expensive than street food in Jemaa El-Fnaa.    Attentive services with excellent food and wine and beautiful surroundings made our evening here a delight.

La Maison Arabe,StylianosAlatsis wrote a review Feb 2014,50,Unbelievably Good Service -- Sets the Bar,I had the distinct pleasure of staying at La Maison Arabe and spending a few days with enjoying the service. If I good give a place a sixth star I would their service makes me want to go back and reevaluate all my prior reviews.    I arranged for transfer from the airport and was met promptly by my driver. The hotel entrance is located on a quiet little allyway a short walk from the road. On arrival I was treated to mint tea and allowed to relax in the salon while they dealt with my paperwork/passport. There was a fire going in the salon and it really felt like I had just come home. There are two adjoining salons one done in traditional decorations which I really liked and a modern one. I then received a wonderful tour of the hotel from one of the front desk attendants. The hotel has two inner courtyards. The first adjoins the salons and the traditional Moroccan restaurant. The second contains the pool and the International restaurant. I enjoyed taking breakfast in the courtyard with the pool.    Rooms  After the tour I was shown to my room. They had been nice enough to upgrade my room to a junior suite I had booked a lower tier suite. The room was huge and well-appointed. I think I had forgotten to indicate that I was travelling alone and not as a couple and so they had decorated it beautifully with rose petals. When my girlfriend heard about that she really let me have on the phone. The room had a fireplace in the sitting area a great bathroom and a balcony overlooking the pool. After walking around in some of the dirty parts of Marrakech the room and hotel was an oasis to return to.    Food/Breakfast  The service staff of the restaurants was amazing! My first and second nights I ate at the traditional Moroccan restaurant within the hotel. The first night of my arrival I was presented with a complementary beverage mint tea and dessert. For the main course I had lamb tagine with a side of couscous. The food was excellent and the restaurant is well decorated. I am still not sure if the ceiling is tiles or painted. There was live music to listen which really capped off the experience. For this reason I returned the second night and the service was just as impeccable. The staff is so humble and welcoming it was like being served by family. The second night I had the chicken and lemon tagine with couscous. Once again they brought me mint tea and dessert (cookies). They treated me like a king and I can't say how welcoming it was when I was travelling alone.    Breakfast  For breakfast you have the choice of taking it in your room or at the restaurant by the pool. I liked to sit by the pool. The staff had some great suggestions on local foods to try with breakfast that I probably would not have tried if eating in my room.    Location  The hotel has a great location. It is walking distance to the souks and Jemaa el fna. It is just far enough away from those locations though where you escape from the tourists and the vendors.,Date of stay: January 2014,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Charlotte, North Carolina",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StylianosAlatsis

La Maison Arabe,Geoffrey H wrote a review Jan 2014,50,Fantastic,We stayed for a week in January knowing the sun wouldn't be guaranteed at this time of year. What a fabulous hotel! Technically a riad but not like any other I've stayed in. The buildings are beautiful well kept with fires in the many open fireplaces throughout the place when it's chilly outside. 5 houses originally now combined incredibly well into the Maison Arabe Some real history here too. Rooms traditionally decorated with some very nice unique if maybe quirky features. Room was plenty warm enough on the cold nights. Magnificent bed looking up into a vaulted domed roof. Super bathroom with excellent shower. Breakfasts as good as any I've ever experienced from dates figs & preserved pears through eggs cooked anyway you want them in front of you sausages home made soup (yes for breakfast!!) yoghurt & bread and so it goes on. Thoroughly recommend the cookery school even if you are not a real cooking buff. Great fun & you actually produce your own dinner!! Complimentary afternoon tea is a nice touch as are the litres of bottled water which appear constantly in your room. I didn't have to buy a single drop of bottled water during the whole week. Both The Moroccan & The International restaurants are also excellent. Hammam on site also really good. The Country Club is a real bonus. Although the Riad is in the heart of the Medina & where you really want to be a few minutes on the free shuttle & you are in this oasis of calm.Don't miss it! The staff throughout the hotel are the real stars. They were absolutely the best I've met anywhere in the world. Jazz bar in the evenings with a quiet singer playing a piano makes for a relaxing end to the day. 3 suggestions. A hairdresser for the ladies after the Hammam would be useful (& help prevent fretting over frizzy) a somewhat lighter bar snacks menu with maybe just toasted sandwich type snacks & get the piano player to play a bit longer.

Each and every piece of the decoration is carefully selected and placed which shows owner's grate taste of art. It is a place where we wanted to live in were it feels so home. In the La Maison Arab food is out of this world it was one of the best we've ever had. Moreover the spa and the hammam's atmosphere takes you to a different world as well as the professionals there. We had the pleasure of meeting the owner who was so friendly and inviting. We will definitely recommend the riad to our friends and family next time they are in Marrakesh.,Date of stay: January 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amodir

La Maison Arabe,Karen M wrote a review Jan 2014,50,They have it all!,Most of the restaurants we review may score highly on food or location or service but rarely all 3. Our evening at Maison Arabe was outstanding on all 3! We nearly booked to stay there this time and on the basis of our visit tonight we know for sure where we will book for any return stay in Marrakech. In just a 2 hour visit tonight we were made to feel more welcome than we have in our 3 days at our hotel ( that review will follow)  Nothing was too much trouble and the standard of service was friendly and pleasant from front of house to bar staff and waiting staff. These people have really got it right. It takes more than a nice pool and nice grounds or good location for a hotel and restaurant to lure people back.

La Maison Arabe,7frog wrote a review Jan 2014,50,Fantastic,Morocco is a country full of rich culture. Life in Morocco is full of contrasts whether it be people colors at the markets or the accommodation . Arriving in Marrakech which is full on hot busy market places and many sites to see. It was a wonderful relief to arrive at La Maison Arabe. It is the oldest Raid in Marrakech and it is full of charm and old world delights. The windy stairs to the beautiful spacious apartment or the jazz Bar or the most amazing experience at the restaurant. Everything here is sincere the people who work here truly love to share the experience with you. Nothing is too much trouble.

La Maison Arabe,OrrvilleRedRider wrote a review Jan 2014,50,A gracious and comfortable property in the Marrakech Medina,My wife 16 year old son and I spent five nights at La Maison Arabe in December 2013. The hotel came highly praised. Our experience did not disappoint.    The setting:    La Maison Arabe is near the edge of the Medina in Marrakech. That makes it relatively easy to get to upon arrival (or by vehicle) – but also perhaps makes the experience just a little less exotic than that of some of the other properties (say Maison MK) that are deeper into the Medina. That said it was plenty exotic enough for us.    It is comprised – we were told – of 5 separate riads (walled houses built around courtyards) that were combined into a single hotel. The “patio” side of the hotel is original (older more maze-like spaces) while the “garden” side is of new construction (and actually separated from the patio side by an alley crossed almost seamlessly by a hallway suspended one floor up). The “garden” side is generally much more spacious and “linear” than the “patio” side – but with perhaps a little less sense of place.    So if you want “new” and more orderly go for the garden side. If you want quirky and older (but just as comfortable) go for the patio side.    The furnishings décor and ambiance are all first rate – the property is very well maintained and there are many comfortable spaces of different types – both inside and outside -- in which to relax.    Our Rooms:    We had two rooms. A Patio Junior Suite and a Patio Deluxe Room. The Junior Suite was on the top floor and consisted of a single L-shaped large room. Oddly due to the dimensions of the room the bed was in the part of the “L” next to the entry with a sitting area beyond the bed around the corner of the “L”. In actual use that arrangement wasn’t a problem. We had a private terrace beyond the sitting area which overlooked the “Garden” side and the pool.    Our room had two comfortable chairs inside and three chairs outside for reading and relaxation. We also had a fireplace and writing desk/chair. Lighting was generally pretty good. My only quibble would be that only one of the indoor chairs was usable for reading at night.    The bathroom had two sinks and a tub/shower combo. The tub was very narrow making standing for the shower a little bit tricky – you couldn’t stand with your feet side by side you needed to adopt a “front/back” stance. Not a problem in the end but quirky enough.    I found our room to be very comfortable.    It being winter (highs in the upper 60’s lows in the 40’s) the radiators in the main room and bathroom were going full force and made the room much too warm for us (we want to sleep in a 65 (18 C) degree room and the room would have been 75 degrees or more with the windows closed). We compensated by opening the windows both day and night. I suppose we could have run the A/C but that seemed silly given the time of year.    Our son was originally scheduled to have the room next to ours but for whatever reason was given a different room two courtyards away and two floors down. His room was less successful – no real place to sit in the room (other than the desk). He did have a large patio with several seating opportunities. Unfortunately because of the location of his room he really had no privacy with the curtains open (other rooms looked down on his room). So if he wanted privacy he needed to close the curtains. But closing the curtains meant he couldn’t have the windows open so his room got very warm at night due to the radiator – until he decided to run the A/C.    Both rooms had first class linens and bedding.    The moral: Some rooms on the patio side are more successful than others. In particular if you like privacy or more natural light I’d opt for rooms on the higher floors.    The Service:    On the whole the service was very good. Our airport pickup was seamless and reception at the hotel efficient and warm. Housekeeping did not miss a beat. The wait staff was friendly and welcoming and food service in the restaurants excellent. More than sufficient English was available. Recommendations from the front desk were also terrific and spot on.    I arranged for dinner reservations ahead of time. Although I can’t confirm this I suspect that the hotel was able to arrange a dinner for us (at Gastro MK) that we might not have otherwise been able to obtain.    The only odd part of the service was during the initial contact to try to get dinner reservations. The first correspondent was somewhat relaxed about dinner – advising that I simply wait until arrival to get make reservations. That didn’t sit well with me so after some negotiation I asked for reservations for the first two nights. That resulted in me being handed off to the reservations manager who immediately advised that we book everything ahead of time. Exactly what I had been trying to do for a week I thought. Not a big problem in the end but a little incongruous.    The Restaurants:    We ate breakfast every morning at the hotel and had dinner one night each in the “3 Saveurs” and “Moroccan” restaurants. The breakfasts were great – with the help of outdoor heaters we ate outside each morning. The dinners were also very good – especially the Moroccan restaurant. I’d gladly eat at either restaurant again.    The Verdict:    La Maison Arabe is a very well-run hotel with a delightful ambiance and terrific sense of place. It was a wonderful base for us to explore the Medina in Marrakech. I don’t often say this about a hotel but I just “felt at home” at La Maison Arabe. I highly recommend it.,Date of stay: December 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"New Albany, Ohio",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OrrvilleRedRider

The hotel has two parts. The older rooms are full of character and nicely decorated in the old part of the building the newer part of the hotel has more modern rooms which they are also lovely but more modernly decorated. The restaurant at the hotel is really good would recommend to try it if you have time as there is so many good places to eat in Marrakech... It also worth going to the out of town gardens and pool belonging to the hotel there is a complementary bus service and its a nice place to visit and relax.

La Maison Arabe,TW808 wrote a review Dec 2013,50,Fantastic hotel - service par excellence,My girlfriend and I spent four fantastic nights here recently for my 50th birthday celebration. Marrakech was wonderful and exotic and the hotel made our stay equally memorable. We had read the good reviews before making our booking but the hotel surpassed our expectations.    The service from the moment we arrived to when we left was exceptional - all the staff was friendly attentive and nothing was too much trouble. I have stayed in a lot of top hotels around the world - La Maison Arabe ranks as one of the best in terms of service. They have managed to combine luxury with that special personal touch.    All the little touches that many institutions find so difficult to accommodate seem to come naturally to the staff here. Nothing was too much trouble. For example when we asked one morning about where best to buy some bottled water we were promptly presented with two bottles for free. When we asked whether we could order dinner from one of the two restaurants to be brought to our room (as we preferred the menu to the room service menu) we were reassured without hesitation that it would be no problem at all. I know what the answer would have been in a lot of hotels.    We were even given a local mobile phone to use for free on our daily trips around the souks in case we got lost (which we did once or twice). As we were leaving the hotel on the last day to go to the airport the manager heard us talk about buying some biscuits or sweets at the airport as gifts and suggested to us that it would be much cheaper to buy these in town. He then instructed the hotel driver to take us to a local patisserie before taking us on to the airport. By the way he was right of course. We were also given a late check-out at no extra charge as our flight was not until late afternoon.    The hotel itself is beautifully decorated with charm and elegance. There are lots of lovely secluded areas where you can chill and relax. There is so much character in every corner of this hotel that was apparently put together from several riads. We stayed in a spacious and tranquil deluxe room with our own balcony overlooking the inner courtyard. It would have been nice to have spent more time taking advantage of our lovely balcony but we were too busy exploring Marrakech.    The food in the restaurants was also very good. We ate in the hotel as well as in the top ranked restaurant in Marrakech and we had lovely meals in both. Dinner around the candle-lit pool in the hotel whilst being serenaded by Moroccan musicians is a must for romance.    Breakfast is also served around the pool. Although we could have had breakfast served to us on our own balcony as well we didn't take advantage of that option as it was so lovely to start the day with a relaxing breakfast around the pool in the morning. The restaurant staff as elsewhere in the hotel were very friendly and attentive without being intrusive.    The hotel also has a great spa - the spa itself is a lovely candle-lit grotto. My girlfriend and I both had very good treatments there.    Location-wise the hotel is located conveniently about 10-15 mins walk from the Djemaa el-Fna square so it is close enough to all the sights but also tucked away in a quieter corner.    We would definitely recommend this hotel and would love to stay there if we visit Marrakech again.,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TW808

La Maison Arabe,dmts wrote a review Dec 2013,50,Fantastic Honeymoon in a beautiful hotel,We just got back from our honeymoon at La Maison Arabe. We took the Royal Suite which is over 3 floors including private roof terrace and jacuzzi and were just overwhelmed by the place and especially by the staff. From the bellboy to the manager they could not do enough for us and they really made the holiday for us.    For example we were very bad at planning and woke up one morning feeling like a trip to the Ourika valley. We asked the manager at 10:45 if it was too late to organise an excursion that day and by 11:00 he had a people carrier and driver outside the front door waiting for us.    The breakfasts were wonderful - weather permitting these are served by the pool and besides a wide range of buffet food they will cook eggs for you any way you like.    Be sure to make use of the private and complimentary country club & gardens. These are a 15 miunute drive away and there is a free shuttle every hour. There's a larger pool nice gardens and small restaurant there - nice if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the Medina and just lounge in the sun for a while.    To summarise - these are nice folks running a beautiful hotel really well.

La Maison Arabe,Elinlax wrote a review Dec 2013,50,A great hotel - and restaurant,I celebrated a birthday at this historic and beautiful riad Le Maison Arabe by participating in their introductory cooking course followed by a dinner with friends. Regrettably we did not stay at this wonderful hotel this time - but hopefully during the next visit to Marrakech. The cooking course was top notch - very informative entertaining and perfectly planned as well as executed. The cooking courses of Le Maison Arabe are highly recommendable. As to the dinner itself - the food was beyond wonderful and the settings were incredibly beautiful. Even though I did not stay at the hotel - I had to communicate with the staff on several occasions for planning etc. The level of service offered at this hotel is incredible - possibly beyond anything you find elsewhere in Morocco.

La Maison Arabe,MXE wrote a review Dec 2013,50,Splendor,This is a beautiful place and like most of The Medina's best spots it's hidden away in a modest and relatively hard to find location. The modest exterior doesn't prepare you for the splendor and relaxed decadence inside. We didn't stay but visited for drinks on one night and I felt like I'd be transported into a different era. This is a pretty special experience for the senses and the ego - almost psychedelic if you understand my meaning.    On another occasion we ate with friends and family... food in Marrakesh can be repetitive but is generally to my taste so I am more than happy about that. This was among the best examples of Moroccan food particularly the platters to start with and the setting was really nice and colourful with live music (just right not too intrusive).    I get the sense that it is the type of place you'd be very excited and proud to take friends to if it were their first visit to the city... there's something about walking down a nondescript road and through a modest door into somewhere so special...

La Maison Arabe,IAG2608 wrote a review Nov 2013,50,An amazing hotel,My wife and I stayed at La Maison Arabe in Marrakech for three nights as part of an extensive trip around Morocco. We had already experienced some terrific Riads in Rabat Fes and Ouarzazate but La Maison Arabe was easily the best accommodation we stayed in during our Moroccan trip. In fact La Maison Arabe may be the best accommodation we have ever stayed in. Certainly nothing springs to mind that we would say was better. The level of individual service provided by the staff at La Maison Arabe has to be experienced to be believed. They even gave us a cellular phone with the number of the Riad already entered so that we could call if we ever had any problems while visiting the city. In addition to the service (which is really what sets this hotel apart from others) the room was extremely well appointed and the other facilities were simply world class.

It has a quiet unassuming entrance which leads into a beautiful interior of 6 raids beautifully decorated with a cool courtyard.  Our room was tastefully decorated in typical Moroccan style. The hotel has two excellent restaurants ( one indoors specialising in Moroccan food and one outside for Moroccan and international food).  There is also a villa outside of the city owned by the hotel which has an outdoor pool etc. this is 20 minutes away via free hotel taxi and when we were there there were only 4 other people. It was like having your own villa.  The staff at the hotel were very very polite and attentive.

La Maison Arabe,pascal2305 wrote a review Nov 2013,50,Simple Luxury in the heart of the Medina,Where do I start? in a few words the BEST small hotel I have stayed at in years.  The decor simply gorgeous and perfect just perfect. Each single piece of furniture every single doors lights fixtures simply tastefully decorated warm luxurious but never over the top  The service is also a winner the most accommodating i have experienced in years. My wife got sick and the next day every single staff member came to see us to see how they could help even the General Manager. We asked for a last minute reservation at one of the most difficult restaurant in Marrakech and they came through as they knew it was important to us.  The Morrocan restaurant so elegant and the flood matches the place. A unique wine list composed only of Moroccan wines. The waited had nothing against us simply trying a few of them so we could make our own decision i believe i tasted 6.  The lamb for 2 is out of this world.  The SPA waooooo…..so beautiful the hammam is a MUST for anyone staying at the hotel. Received 2 massages…perfect.  i just wish i lived in Europe i could spend so many weekends at La Maison Arabe….We will be back,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pascal2305
La Maison Arabe,Alison A wrote a review Nov 2013,50,An awesome start…...,We have just returned from the most fabulous holiday in Morroco - and La Maison Arab was our first stop. We were blown away from the moment we walked through the doors and our expectations were more than met throughout. From waking up to THE most incredible breakfast to the warm friendly staff and the unbelievable architecture there is something for everyone. We dined in the Morrocan Restaurant first night which was fabulous and the last night we ate our own creation!! The cooking workshop was an absolute highlight - but Marrakech for us was simply amazing. Incredible sights sounds smells AND shopping - heaven!! We had a local guide which I would say was absolutely worth it.,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Kenya,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alisona415

La Maison Arabe,mangerbien wrote a review Nov 2013,50,Maison Arabe Cookery school,I booked a half day course and thoroughly enjoyed it. It is obvious that they have huge experience in running cookery courses and the morning was really well planned. My class was 6 in total- I think maximum size 8. We started with an outline of what we would be doing and a demonstration of breakfast pancakes being made followed by a tasting.We then visited a nearby bakery to see the master baker taking delivery of loaves from locals and firing them. The course was led by the delightful and knowledgeable Wafaa with a Dada doing all the actual cooking . Our dish was a chicken and preserved lemon tagine to be served with two Moroccan salads. Each course member has a work station in the teaching kitchen with two gas rings sink  choping board etc.; full and detailed oral and printed instructions are given and everyone prepares their own dish while watching the dada do the dish. Each station has a screen showing the Dada working in close up. The course is totally hands on but they carefully watch that everyone keeps up and help out if required! The course concludes with the eating of the meal- my husband who did not do the course was able to come and share my dishes! There is a lovely cook book for purchase.,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,jersey,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mangerbien

La Maison Arabe,Kiwi75 wrote a review Nov 2013,50,First class Riad,What a great Riad big enough to be interesting but small enough to still feel authentic. We loved our stay here. The staff were fantastic the design of the hotel magical and the food excellent. We stayed in the Royal Suite which suited our family of three very well with the two separate levels and one bathroom on each level. Only minor gripe would be that the air-conditioning seemed incredibly noisy.    We enjoyed our cooking class which was very well organised and included a visit to the hotels small shop outside the hotel and also a bakery where they bake everyone’s bread.    There was a major power cut while we were there and the staff coped admirably for the 8 or so hours that the power was off. We all tried the spa which was good but being underground (where the spa is located) during the power cut was not ideal.,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Auckland, New Zealand",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kiwi75

With 3 others and under the exceptional guidance and instruction of Mafaa and the hotel's ""Dada"" I spent the morning making a chicken tagine a hot salad and a cold salad. The result (for all of us) was mouthwateringly delicious and educational. I have not attended a cookery class before but I do know that the bar is now set exceedingly high.

La Maison Arabe,DKentnyc wrote a review Nov 2013,50,An Oasis in the heart of the Medina,I heard about La Maison Arabe several years ago from friends. Their comments were so overwhelmingly positive they actually gushed I didn't think everything they said could possibly - I was wrong. This small hotel is superlative in every way - the staff's hospitality attention to detail and graciousness is peerless. . The restaurant served some of the best Moroccan food i had while in Marrakech and when I had had my film of tangines I dined in the hotel's continental restaurant where I had an amazing dinner of baby lamb chops and possibly the best lemon tart I've ever had - that's a big complement coming from a New York foodie. The design and decor of the rooms and the common areas - the pool the various bars the rooms and suites - are filled with unique furnishings and accessories which I found out were carefully chosen by the discerning eye of proprietor Prince Fabrizio Ruspoli. And don't let the fact that he's a prince steer you in the wrong direction - this place is comfortable welcoming relaxing and not at all stuffy. And finally the hotel's proximity to Fna Square and the souks meant I could wander around for a few hours or the entire day and if I got tired or overladen with purchases it was just a quick walk back to the hotel where I could revive myself with a drink a swim or a visit to the spa. Just as I didn't believe my friends when they raved about this place you probably think I'm exaggerating but it's all true - Maison Arabe is just wonderful. It's a bit pricey but compared to what you get it is worth every penny.

La Maison Arabe,grwebster wrote a review Nov 2013,50,"Back again and again, always something new.",we have stayed here on every trip to Marrakesh for over 13 years sometimes twice in a year. Each time we leave we even more impressed with everything- the personnel are very welcoming service exceptional especially the fast room service and continuous upgrades of the rooms restaurants bar and the heated pool. One unique feature to take advantage of is the private gardens pool and restaurant that can be visited by a 15 minute free shuttle service. If you have time a lunch around the garden pool is an experience to behold. The cooking school is located there and is worth taking a class or two if you have time.  The Maison Arabe is not the Mamounia one the same top level but different in many ways- smaller more exclusive less ostentatious and quietly hidden in the city center near the souk/medina.  BTW Something you don't see anywhere else is that their rooms offer desk level plugs for charging all the electronic items we carry with us these days-its an example of the attention to detail the Maison Arabe addresses in most everything.  It is a very sophisticated quite luxurious place to stay.

La Maison Arabe,306lr wrote a review Nov 2013,40,"A seasoned, refined riad in Marrakech",We happily spent two nights in the Nahar royal suite as well as enjoyed the riad's spa piano bar and two restaurants during our stay. Having pioneered the riad hotel concept in Marrakech La Maison Arabe's experience is evident in its gracious service.    All the staff were unfailingly courteous and eager to please; Morad at the front desk deserves a special mention for his warm welcome to the property and the city as well as ensuring our comfort throughout our stay.    It has been several years since the last renovation but all in all the property is kept up well. When we arrived there were some minor adjustments needed in our suite (i.e. the remote control for the air conditioner a locked safe and a burned out light bulb in a closet) which were taken care of right away.    The evening ambiance at the bar and the poolside restaurant is very pleasant. The spa is well-designed and the staff were more gentle with the hammam gommage and subsequent massage than at other facilities.    For the high caliber of its service and attention to guest needs we would not hesitate to go back to La Maison Arabe.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,New York,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/306lr

La Maison Arabe,Liz and Arthur wrote a review Oct 2013,50,Attention to detail,La Maison Arabe  What can I say that hasn’t already been said? From the moment we stepped off the lane in the medina just 10 minutes from the main square and were greeted by the charming manager who took us to a small courtyard for a refreshing mixed fruit drink (lime orange banana mint) served with nuts while our paper work was processed and our room made ready until the time we left 4 days later you could not fault the attention to detail. Our huge room overlooked the courtyard pool. Because this has been built in two stages and actually straddles two streets it takes a little time to find your way around – but all is explained when you are given a tour of the place including the wellness centre with its hamam. There is plenty to see in Marrakech but do spend some time at the hotel’s Kasbah and garden pool about 20 minutes away. A shuttle leaves on the half hour and you can swim walk in the garden and have a light lunch. From day to evening there is so much you can do tea and pastries by the pool cocktails in the jazz bar dinner in one of the two restaurants. We enjoyed the food so much we ate there every night. My husband was suffering post shingles pain so didn’t feel like going out too much. The staff are so attentive and always asked how he was.

La Maison Arabe is an oasis of calm and elegance in the midst of the chaos. The hotel is located down an alley off a main street near the Djemma-el-Fna. It is an interesting structure architecturally; it is actually fun to try to find one's way around. The hospitality of the staff including a great bartender and an amazing group at the front desk is absolutely first class. The rooms are magnificent combining Moroccan art and sensibility with modern features. The restaurant is elegant with great food and service and amazing ambiance overlooking a beautiful pool.

La Maison Arabe,Ian S wrote a review Sep 2013,50,The best place from over 150 we have ever stayed in,My wife and I consider ourselves pretty seasoned travelers having been to about 50 countries and stayed in over 150 commercial accommodations from mega luxury to modest and from one night to weeks in the last decade or so.  After the grueling and tediously boring 8+ hours train trip from Fes we arrived in Marrakech and were met by a pleasant English speaking guide exactly as booked with La Maison Arabe. We were taken a short drive in a modern aircon'd Mercedes van to the hotel and escorted into the lobby where we were pleasantly greeted by a number of staff. A lovely gesture was moist scented cool face-washer/towelettes to dab of the dust and grime of the journey. From that moment on throughout our stay every member of the staff was overtly concerned for our comfort and well-being We mentioned we needed to freshen up and that there was no lunch or even any refreshment on the train. We were efficiently checked-in then guided through the interesting adjoining buildings that comprise this riad to our room.  The room was light bright and well appointed with a small separate sitting area mini-bar flat screen TV and balcony overlooking the swimming pool. The bathroom was modern and well appointed with toiletries and plenty of towels.  A nice touch was rose petals dotted around that added to the welcome.  Within just a few moments there was a knock on the door and a staff member presented a tray of cheese and fruit and tea with compliments of the management (responding that we had had no lunch). This was a thoughtful and appreciated touch and one of just many we experienced over the next few days. For example the first day at breakfast I selected a home made yoghurt from the buffet and placed in on my table. I did the same thing the second day. On the third day before I got to the yoghurt the attentive waiter had already placed it on our table. Another was my wife asked the in-house pastry chef for a vanilla millefeulle. He hadn't made any that day but did so the next and one was brought to our room for her. I needed to get a sole glued onto a sneeker and asked the porter where a cobbler was located and practically had to fight him off taking it for repair for me explaining I really wanted the experience.  We both enjoyed lovely treatments in the day spa an amusing session in their cooking school (not fine dining but fun nevertheless). All the meals and wine at their outlets were internationally good standard which thoroughly we enjoyed.  Everyday there was attention and care. This is not the flashest hotel or the biggest or even the most luxurious - but it was the best we have ever experienced in terms of welcome and constant discreet attention and effort to make our stay comfortable enjoyable and fulfilling.  The owner also has a country club a short drive out of town where we spend a pool-side afternoon taking lunch and relaxing in the cool gardens.  If we ever have occasion to go back to Marrakeck we would stay here again.,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Brisbane Region, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuxTime
La Maison Arabe,Claire P wrote a review Sep 2013,40,Take time to enjoy the hotel,Maison Arabe is an old riad with thick terracotta walls spacious rooms over looking the central pool come dining area. The service is pleasant and unobtrusive with a relaxed and congenial atmosphere. Take time to enjoy the surroundings and calm before heading to the Medina and souks which are an easy walk away but most of all enjoy the food. There are international dishes but you would be mad not to try the delicious local dishes spectacular Morroccan wines and all the sweet treats you can manage. The hotel is old full of character and because of this you forgive the slightly worn furnishings and occasional bit of bad plumbing although for the price maybe not.

Yes the rooms were beautifully appointed clean and the beds very comfortable. Yes the location was central and we could walk to the souks and the square but it is the staff that wins you over above all else. Ahmed gave us a wonderful half day guided tour of Morocco We definitely needed this and learnt so much about Morocco its people and its history. We couldn't have navigated the souks without him. Mr Adil Chaif and other staff at the concierge desk were very professional and helpful. Badr the manager of the restaurant arranged a beautiful surprise birthday cake for my friends birthday along with restaurant staff singing traditional berber music to her. It was done beautifully without a hint of cheesiness! The food in the restaurant was the best we tasted during our 3 day stay and we had already dined at the renowned Comptoir Restaurant. The late 4.30pm checkout made our last day in Morocco so much easier and relaxing. A very personalised service overall. After the constant hassling in the souks and the square the continuing effort required to avoid the rip off merchants the beautiful surreal and tiring experience of trekking in the Atlas Mountains this was a haven of tranquility to come back to.

My husband was in 7th heaven reading his book on the very large bed with a large olive tree overhead. Great for de-stressing! The peace and tranquility splendid the welcome drink fabulous and the salads that we had by the pool totally delicious.  As I said the only downside was leaving La Maison Arabe and that really illustrates how very special a place it is.,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Windsor, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoniaSSF
La Maison Arabe,travelinhope wrote a review Sep 2013,50,My Hotel of the Year....,"...and quite possibly of the decade. Stayed here twice during a trip to Morocco. Firstly in room 216for 4 nights a suite in the older part of the hotel. Traditional furniture lots of little windows (plus big ones) and a large patio overlooking the pool. Then returned for three nights to room 244 which is in the more modern part. Bright well furnished and the most storage I have experienced in any hotel. Two full runs of wardrobe hanging plus 33 (I counted) drawers and shelves. A big lovely relaxing room with large double windows looking onto the pool and across to the mosque.    Extraordinary hospitality and service from all the staff. One night there was a slightly intrusive noise of air conditioning. It was late and we wondered whether to mention it. Within two minutes of the call to reception a staff member was on the scene and pronounced ""No good -like jet engine!"" Ten minutes later there were muffled noises from the roof where the hotel technician was fixing the problem....at 1.30 am!! Amazing!    The pool in the evening is the setting for dinner by soft lights and candles with a very talented group of musicians playing traditional music in the background. Excellent food a fusion of local and french cuisine.    The location is perfect - ten minutes walk to the main square and less to the souks with the bonus of a country garden and pool just 15 minutes by the hotel's courtesy car. For two blissful afternoons we had it almost to ourselves. Glasses of cool mint cordial and ice cream and water melon given free and a snack bar for a light lunch.    I really cannot rate this hotel too highly and many thanks for an unforgettable stay to all the smiling helpful and lovely staff.",Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Oxford UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelinhope

I was on business in Casablanca and a friend recommended that I visit La Maison Arabe and I am so glad that I did.    The staff are very kind and accommodating. The hotel is so interesting and beautiful - there were many different places to explore within the hotel and you never felt like there were many other people around. I have stayed in other hotels in Morocco and none of them hold up to the standards of this place.    My bed was really comfortable and loved my room. I had a terrace and had breakfast on the terrace a couple of the mornings of my stay which was really great.    I also had a couple of treatments at the spa - which were excellent. Having a private steam room was lovely and then a relaxing massage at the end was very good. The price for this treatment was very reasonable.    Overall I am very impressed with this hotel.

The staff were fantastic and very helpful. We loved our room – we had one overlooking the pool. The food was incredible and the breakfast was out of this world.    We really enjoyed the Moroccan restaurant – what an experience. We had a beef and lamb tagines – they were both really delicious. We loved the music as well. The restaurant is beautifully decorated in traditional moroccan style.    The spa treatments were amazing – best massage we have ever had and the spa staff are outstanding.    The best kept secret is the country club location – which is a another location about 15 mins from the hotel via a shuttle – with beautiful gardens and a huge pool. It was such a tranquil place.    We chose this hotel because of the great reviews on trip advisor and we were not let down. We whole heartedly recommend this hotel. It is one of the best we have ever stayed at.

The Riad itself is well situated extremely clean and well cared for. What set this place apart however was the incredibly supportive staff. They responded to each and every request we had and always with a smile. When we were ripped off a little while shopping they even interceded with the shop keeper to get our money back!    The food in the restaurants and bar was terrific and of course the service was great as well.

The service was excellent the Jazz bar is a beautiful space as are many of the small lounges and courtyard spaces. The rooms (in the modern part of the hotel) were good though lacked some Moroccan charm or feel for me.

We decided to go for dinner as our friend had said it was the best place they went to during their stay in Morocco.  We didn't make a reservation but we got there well before the restaurant opened for the evening. We went to the bar and had drinks while we waited. The decor was just absolutely stunning!  The staff were super friendly and extremely efficient. With our drinks they served us a variety of little nibbles such as nuts olives and peppers which was such a nice touch.  The restaurant was as equally gorgeous we were seated next to the pool and there were candles lit everywhere giving it a very romantic feel.  They had two men on acoustic guitars singing which added to the experience.  The food was amazing and was my favourite during our stay in Marrakech.  I highly recommend this place to all!

Marrakech was certainly that but despite heat in the 40's and Ramadam it was well worth it. You have to be careful but we didn't find intimidating ate In the square bartered and loved the vibrant activity. In the middle of this La Maison was a wonderful oasis of calm. The rooms luxurious the staff great and breakfast in the courtyard by the pool wonderfully calming. Being in the Medina made us feel even more absorbed. The hotel also has a Kasbah/country club that you reach by shuttle bus. After a half day walking the souks this was fantastic. The hotel also recommended great restaurants.

The Guest Services Manager Adil arranged some wonderful restaurant's and a guide to show us the sites who was fantastic.

In weather was very hot in August but the hotel has a country club close by with a free transfer once you arrive you are greeted by the staff who offer you a free welcome drink the pool is lovely. A tranquil place to relax away from the bustle and heat of Marrakesh. The location is great as you are within the city walls so can walk most places. My husband tried the spa which was lovely.

La Maison Arabe,ChrisfromWelly wrote a review Aug 2013,50,La Maison Arabe,Stayed here in July 2013 with my Mother. The staff were super helpful and friendly. Being NZ'ers and a little short on Arabic or French language skills the staff had a good knowledge of English which was really appreciated by us!    The hotel is just gorgeous boutique-ish and tastifully done. Location is good - and easy to find which isn't always the case with some hotels/Riads in Morocco if they are in the old part of the cities and down a series of narrow alleyways. Not the case with La Maison Arabe. About a 50 metre walk (if that) from where the taxi dropped us off.    Would highly recommend the Moroccan cooking class that the hotel runs - we had so much fun and it was a lovely experience.    Would also highly recommend the Spa - it has a wonderful atmosphere - really beautiful and the treatments that Mum and I had left us feeling really rejuvenated - especially since we had been sightseeing in 38C plus temperatures.    The hotel was also able to arrange for a guide to show us around. We used guides in each of the cities we visited in Morocco and would recommend the use of them. In the medinas (old walled parts of the cities) you can get really lost and not get to see the sights that you want to see. The guides make sure you get there quickly and easily. The added bonus is that you get to learn so much more about Moroccan life and culture as the guides readily share their knowledge and personal life with you.    Lastly we stayed in some lovely places in Morocco - La Maison Arabe was our favourite and I would go back to Marrakech just so I could stay there again. It was the perfect oasis amongst the chaos of a busy city.,Date of stay: July 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Wellington, New Zealand",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisfromWelly

La Maison is a converted riad with a ton of character enhanced by excellent customer service. It's conveniently located to Jemaa el Fne and the souks. The restaurant at the hotel is top notch and the bar at the hotel was outstanding(although I wished they carried a bigger variety of beers). During our stay there was a scheduling mixup concerning a cooking class that we had signed up for. No worries-Adil the GM made it right by rescheduling a private lesson for my wife the following day. Not easy during Ramadan.  My wife raved about the Hamman at La Maison.  While in Marrakech I took a walk-through and had a drink at one of the other large top hotels in Marrakesh. I found it to be stuffy and a little snooty. On the other hand La Maison was comfortable to us and quickly felt like our home in the midst of crazy Marrakech.

La Maison Arabe,SCNYCT wrote a review Jul 2013,50,A Memorable Moroccan Experience,I had the pleasure of staying at La Maison Arabe on my very first and recent trip to Marrakech.    This wonderful hotel is a converted riad the very first of it's kind in the Medina and is in a terrific location. The decor is pure Moroccan and you feel the connection to the magical city of Marrakech throughout the public spaces as well as the rooms.    The food at the restaurant is fantastic... from the fresh vegetable juices and homemade yogurt at breakfast to the exquisite chicken and preserved lemon tagine at dinner.    But what really sets this hotel apart and I believe what made this trip such a memorable experience for me is the entire  hotel staff. The very gracious and accommodating hotel managers Taoufik and Nabila were ever present but very low key and just kept the place humming; the guest relations manager Adil is a national treasure - he can make anything happen and always with a warm and welcoming smile; the entire staff (too numerous to name) is unparalleled.

Both the team who run it and those who work there are simply exceptional. Superb customer service from the moment you arrive to the minute you depart. There is nothing that is too much trouble - even on your last day and you're waiting for the airport transfer they look after your every need and make sure you don't want for anything during that time. We were offered a guest room in which to shower and change before leaving and they had completed our emigration forms too - quite unexpected. We had a beautiful first floor suite overlooking the pool - pretty spacious and cool - it was a haven from the heat. They will organise tours get a driver and a car at the drop of a hat and are always on hand to offer advice about where to visit where to eat etc. Its own restaurants are very good though - you should eat here at least once. They also run a cookery school - great fun and good value. The chef and her assistant are charming and everyone had a good time. The Riad has the use of a ""country club"" not 15 mins away (shuttle bus every hour) which is an oasis on a hot afternoon. There you'll find a beautiful pool staffed by the loveliest waiters who again can't do enough for you; providing a complimentary cold drink on arrival fresh fruit and sorbet and even scented cold flannels. Joy. There's a lovely little restaurant on site too - a bit pricey with service charge but very nice. All in all - highly recommended.

La Maison Arabe,sandra l wrote a review Jul 2013,50,Just wonderful,This hotel is just lovely everything about it was just to our taste the food home made the room was luxurious. We found the hotel easy to find just get on the bus no 19 and ask the driver and he will drop you off about 5-7min walk from the hotel. They also have a shop on the street which the lady was very helpful and called the hotel for someone to take our luggage. The staff very helpful anything you need. There is a Country Club what a fabulous place the shuttle takes you there for free and bring you back food and drinks are available there.Taxi from hotel should be about 20dhs to the squarealways agree a price before you take the taxi. Forgot about the spa you must try the Hammam it an experience we just went to see and asked on the day we arrived if we could book anything that moment and they obliged us with a wonderful relaxing 2 hours of scrub massage and steam room this not too be missed wonderful.,Date of stay: July 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,uk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/883sandral
La Maison Arabe,Roko531 wrote a review Jul 2013,50,A lovely hotel,We were staying at this hotel as part of a package which included a couple days with a driver and guide visiting the sites of Marrakech including the medina kasbah souks Atlas mountains and a berber family's home. We were really delighted by everything at La Maison Arabe. The staff were lovely and very helpful. When we entered our room there were rose petals everywhere and our room was attached to a very pleasant courtyard. The highlights for us however were the evenings. We first went each evening to the Jazz Bar which is beautifully decorated before dining outside the around the pool. This is a very romantic spot lit entirely with candles and beautiful Moroccon lights. The food and service was absolutely first class to the point where this was the only place that we wanted to be each night. An excellent buffet breakfast is also served in this area each morning. We give them our highest recommendation!,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Caulfield, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roko531

La Maison Arabe,operacat wrote a review Jun 2013,50,The Romance Continues.....,"I see that there are over 600 excellent reviews. What could I possibly have to add? But I feel  compelled to write something because I love this place so much. It is the perfect melding of  riad and hotel. Most riads are very small and don't have hotel services such as front desk  24-hour concierge laundry A/C TV Pool(s) spa housekeeping etc. As far as I know there are  only seven full riad/hotels in Marrakech and La Maison Arabe is perfection.    I was first there for a ""milestone"" birthday celebration with 25 friends in 2011. The way the  staff handled that situation was the equal of any great 7-star large hotel. But this time I was  by myself and was there for almost a month. The staff was flawless and the experience  was supremely professional and yet friendly and caring.    Knowing all the rooms 26 in all I would say that a few are indeed very small but they have  very large private courtyards. If stairs are an issue I would suggest one of the rooms in the  newest wing. There are still eight to ten steps to negotiate from the lobby but there is an  elevator which goes from the top floor down to the restaurant and lower to the spa.  If one has no ability to use stairs this hotel will not work. But for everyone else it's the ONLY  place to be. I also recommend that people traveling with small children go elsewhere where  there are more activities for them. La Maison Arabe is for older people; aged 13 and up.  And peace and quiet is one of the great features prized by guests. Well.....There ARE the  calls to prayer that come as early as 3:30 AM and are easily heard from some of the rooms.  I like that sound; but in the interest of full disclosure it is a fact of life in Muslim countries.    I think beyond the Moroccan charm high level of taste and efficiency of staff there is an ineffable feeling of being cared for as a member of an extended family. I had a bad cold while  there and I was treated to all manner of local ""potions"" and remedies that worked very well.    I wish I could name everyone who is worthy of high praise; but they ALL are. There is the  manager Nabila who is a rare treasure. She knows what you need before you do. At the  desk Adil Mustafa Mourad and the others are so kind. The restaurant staff is always eager  to ensure one has a fine dining experience. The housekeeping staff couldn't be more effective.    A word about the ""Country Club"". This is a lovely garden with a huge refreshing pool and a  place for luncheon al fresco. It's about a 15 minute drive from the hotel and a free shuttle goes back and forth on the hour. It's a most charming place full service pool and luncheon and if  one is lucky there are three kittens and one adult cat who will come to share lunch with you.  They are extremely lovable and attractive.    A couple of practical caveats: As to guides if you want one be sure to arrange it with Nabila  or someone at the desk. Do NOT let someone approach you in the square or on the street  to offer guide services. This is most important.    I was rather surprised to see the way more than a few of the women were dressed. I am  referring to short shorts and spare tops worn by women in their late teens to full middle age.  The ignorance of some people is mind boggling. I am not mindful of Muslim sensibilities in  my country or in Western Europe but when visiting a Muslim country one is a guest in THEIR  home and a much more conservative manner of dress is a must. Oh I'm not saying that one  has to wear an Abaya or a Chador but short shorts and minimal tops are an affront.",Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Los Angeles, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/operacat

We really couldn't have chosen anywhere better for our stay in Marrakech. The staff and service were first class attentive without being over the top. We ate here two nights and on the third night chose to eat out at another 'top' restaurant in the Medina. We sincerely wished that we had eaten here a third night instead! Badr the guy in charge of the restaurant and its staff was extremely friendly and helpful in suggesting places to go. It really was one of the best small hotels that we have ever stayed in - anywhere in the World. The swimming pool at The Country Club is a good size and again staff are attentive and the food there was lovely too. It was an absolute joy to walk through the doors after a few hours wandering around the souks and markets. It was like being taken into a different world in comparison to the heat haggling and dirt which you experience outside.

La Maison Arabe,heleneelisabeth wrote a review Jun 2013,50,The perfect Riad,This was our first trip to Marrakech and I am so happy we chose to stay at the Maison Arabe. I cannot imagine a better riad and here is why; the hotel is within walking distance to the souks and offers a wonderful base for exploring. They were really helpful and were happy to arrange guides and cars for us. They even provided us with a mobile phone to call them in case we got lost in the souks and needed collecting!  If you needed a break from the madness you could either relax in the courtyard or make use of the country club which is available to all guests. The hotel arrange the shuttle and you are then only 15 minutes away from a stunning pool and garden.  We ate and ate and ate during our stay simply because everything tasted so good.  But what makes it stand out is the care and attention of the staff - they were so lovely.

La Maison Arabe,Kiboe wrote a review Jun 2013,50,More than full service,We spent 5 days at the Maison Arabe in Marrakech. The room the atmosphere the entertainment the personal and helpful service and the location including the facilities were all fantastic!!! The hotel consists of 6 old riads (=houses of former times with a little courtyard in the middle where people relaxed from the heat and desert outside) which are adapted very nicely in the Marrocan style. We stayed in the Aladdin Suite which is situated in the old part of the hotel with a nice little terrace overlooking the pool area. We can only recommend this room. The wellness area is in the cellar of the lately built part (although this is also adapted to the Marrocan style of a riad) and we really enjoyed a hammam treatment with massage afterwards. There are two restaurants one mediterranean at the pool and one Marrocan which are also quite nice. Every evening we went to the piano jazz bar with its furniture in the style of the 1930-ies and its very competent barkeeper Rachid who knows how to mix the most fruity and tasty drinks and keeps creating new cocktails offering them as little samples every night. There is always life music around either a piano man playing in the bar or a traditional musician in the courtyard. But what really excited us about the place was also the receptional service. They provided us with a mobile phone in order to call them in the case if we got lost in the confusing area of the Souks or if anything else happened to us so that they could organize help. Moreover we wanted to dine out every evening and they organized nice tables every day even if it was already late for reservations. The hotel is situated in a good residential area of the city and you can reach the Jamaa el Fna in a 10 minutes walk day and night (it is also save to walk in this area at night). All in all we spent exciting and unforgettable days in the Maison Arabe in Marrakech.,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Vienna,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kiboe
La Maison Arabe,rtl212 wrote a review Jun 2013,50,So Good They Make it Difficult to Try New Marrakech Riads,"This was our third stay at Maison Arabe. We like to change hotels when visiting the same cities but this place makes it difficult: there's something perfect about it -- and we tend to be quite critical.    First the public rooms: they are exquisite. The library is a dream the sitting area in the courtyard is beautiful and the bar is one of the most elegant I've ever seen. The owner has impeccable taste and the antiques paintings millwork and seating reflect it.    We've been in 5 different rooms in our multiple visits and my daughter visiting with us was in two - a fair sampling. Each is unique beautifully decorated and comfortable. Though the bathrooms can be on the small side they are very well designed and also beautifully decorated. Most of the rooms we've had come with a private terrace that can be a delight for a drink before or after a day in the city.    Both restaurants are excellent -- keep in mind that Moroccan cuisine isn't always of the haute cuisine sort but they do a beautiful job with the classics and the Saveurs which is a bit more of a ""fusion"" menu is excellent. Eating outdoors at the latter on a spring night is a delightful experience with the swimming pools lined with candles and the lighting providing a romantic setting. The main dining room is elegant -- remarkably beautiful decor and enhanced by the Ghawa musicians.    The staff here is excellent -- gracious discreet always ready to assist and personable. One gets the distinct impression they didn't have to be trained much -- they are instinctively courteous and warm. Though we don't tend to do ""shout outs"" about individual staffers when we write reviews here it's difficult not to mention Rashid the delightful bar man. He is like a friend always presenting new cocktails ideas always at the ready to be sure one has a good supply of olives savories and whatever else one requests.    The hammam is beautiful restful and the service excellent. We also took the cooking class and loved it -- we've taken them elsewhere but they do a terrific job and it includes an explanation of the origins of Moroccan cuisine and includes a fascinating visit to the ""neighborhood oven"" where people bring in their bread dough to be baked.    One other true assets of the hotel is the country club. A ten minute ride on the hotel's SUV shuttle it is beautiful -- large pool gorgeous plantings an excellent light menu and flawless service. We don't know of another riad that lets you enjoy the city and then escape to the Palmeraie for a countryside rest.    One warning -- the hotel is just across the street from a masque and the calls to prayer at 3:30 and 4:30am are the enemy of jetlag. It takes some getting used to.    We've tried some other elegant riads (see our review of La Sultana for example) but none we've sampled offers the authenticity of design location (ten minutes walk to Place Jemma al-Fnaa) service food and genuine warmth.",Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rtl212

Wish we had stayed at La Maison Arabe for our whole stay in Marrakesh! This place is beautiful. It is very traditional but so comfortable. It is down a small lane way and this made for the quiet atmosphere but was convenient to everything. We had dinner in both of the restaurant but we liked the Moroccain best. The courtyard is a lovely spot to have a drink before dinner but there are lots of little spots to either have a drink or just sit and read.

La Maison Arabe,Robert C wrote a review Jun 2013,50,Absolutely superb!,My grown daughters and I stayed at La Maison Arabe in late May and it was certainly one of the top hotel experiences I've ever had. It was excellent from start to finish. The room was lovely. The food was very good especially at their premier restaurant. Breakfast or lunch in their outdoor courtyard by the small pool was a delight. The décor and details throughout the hotel were beautifully done. The larger pool is a 20 minute shuttle ride away but is well appointed and a serene oasis in its own right. We took the cooking class the hotel offered and that too was fun and led by a very gracious and knowledgeable host. Most notable perhaps was how personable and helpful the staff was particularly those at the front desk. (Thank you again Adil Chaif.) This is truly a 5 Star property and I think does a wonderful job of merging the unique aspects of a Moroccan riad with the fine touches and amenities of a top notch hotel.

We were recommended to La Maison Arabe by an experienced traveller and I am pleased to say it did not disappoint. Hidden away down a little alley this secret paradise is a perfect place to relax and unwind after experiencing the excitement and hubub of Marrakesh. Preferring small and more personal to larger hotels this Riad illustrates this perfectly. The staff are simply wonderful nothing is too much trouble and everything is done with a smile. We were lucky enough to stay for 6 nights and enjoyed most aspects of the hotel - The Hammam and spa are pure indulgence one of the best treatments I have ever had. If you have time make sure you book yourself onto the half day cookery course where you learn to make Moroccan bread and wonderful Tangine. Its great fun and very well organised. After a hard morning bartering in the Souks and exploring the city we took advantage of the Country Club a beautiful pool garden and terrace area situated about a 10 minute ride from the hotel on their free shuttle bus.  Our twin room was wonderful - well equipped clean and comfortable with a pretty terrace outside where we enjoyed breakfast. We eat in both the Moroccan and International restaurants which are superb. Dining tip - If you eat at the hotel restaurant a couple of times and would like to try an alternative the hotel recommended us to 'Le Comptoir du Pacha' about 5 minutes walk (one of their staff will accompany you if you wish) where we were met by the wonderful 'Kim' a Vietnamese/French lady. They offer traditional Moroccan food as well as Italian and once a week Vietnamese which we were lucky enough to try and was one of the best meals we had in Marrakech.

We very much enjoyed the individuality of the rooms although I would say that for those who do not like stairs this section of the hotel is not for you.

La Maison Arabe,Roger W wrote a review May 2013,50,Paradise on Earth,We four adults spent four nights here in Mai 2013. The reception on our arrival was exceptional. Mr Adil the Manager showed us round the whole place which is composed of five adjoining Riads. The Riads are tastefully decorated and equipped in traditional moroccan style with a Hammam and Spa which one of our Party used every day and said she'd never had better Treatment.  The rooms are soundproofed and mainly overlook the pool which is surrounded by the courtyard Restaurant. A comprehensive Breakfast was enjoyed by all and Snacks could be had all day long. In the evenings there is a choice between the traditional Morrocan Restaurant where I expressly recommend the Taster Meal introducing many morroccan dishes ( arrive with a BIG Appetite)! Meals may also be taken at the pool Restaurant.  I also recommend taking part in a short ( 1/2 - day course ) in local cuisine where the cook or Dada explains about morroccan cooking and helps you to make a traditional Tagine which can later be eaten together with your Partner.  In the evenings the Jazz cocktailbar is in Operation and during our visit a Pianist played unobtrusive Oldies.  A ten-minute ride in the Hotel bus takes you to the outskirts of Marrakech where the Hotel keeps ist own Garden with pool lounge beds and Snack bar. Don't miss a relaxing afternoon here after a tiring morning in the nearby souks!  I must commend the Management and Staff for being so utterly helpful with all our requests for Transport guides etc. Nothing was too much trouble - we saw only smiling faces - and we shall certainly be going back on our next visit to this fascinating City.

The cooking workshop lasts 5 hours and takes place in a purpose built kitchen overlooking the courtyard and pool - a most wonderful setting. The equipment and chefs were top drawer. The workshop has a very good reputation and I can see why. There is an opportunity to visit a local bakery cook a tagine and other local delicacies.  I did manage make the rather elementary mistake of cutting myself rather badly but was chauffeur driven to the nearest private hospital and fastracked to be seen within 10 minutes. Even the bill was picked up all courtesy of the General Manager Taoufik Ghaffouli. Fantastic service considering I wasn`t even a resident at the hotel.

La Maison Arabe,Nospringchicken wrote a review May 2013,50,"Beautiful Riad, a warm welcome in the heart of the medina",We have just returned from a 5 night stay in this really lovely Riad. We stayed in a patio side suite (room 216) which had a delightful private patio overlooking the pool. The room was lovely spacious and very well equipped (it was up two flights of fairly steep stairs which may be a problem for some) There was a very spacious bathroom. Housekeeping was exceptional and the whole house was spotless attention to the smallest detail was evident. There is a lovely pool (guide books and websites say there isn't one - I believe it was added recently) and a lovely shady sun deck for when the medina is a little too much! We were made very welcome when we arrived and were shown around the house it is a bit of a warren as it is several houses made into one so there are little stair cases and patios around the place.    Breakfast is lovely taken by the pool there is a wide choice including the lovely fruit and yogurt cooked to order Moroccan crepes and eggs and lovely homemade bread pastries and jams. Also it is served until 11am which is great if you like to lie in.    We ate in both restaurants and the food is good especially if you are a tagine fan! The service is good however one night the restaurant appeared to be overbooked and we had to wait a considerable time to be seated. The piano bar is lovely comfortable and very good cocktails! Moroccan wine is very good and matches the food well - there was a good wine list    We took advantage of the country club which is delightful lovely pool and beautiful gardens a great place to chill and have a spot of lunch.    One of the highlights of our stay in Marrakech ( there were a few!) was our experience of the Hammam. We booked a the Hammam and massage package which was just a brilliant experience really relaxing and highly professional service. we were so well looked after.    We didn't experience the cooking school - however we saw the participants coming and going and everyone appeared to be having a great time - there was lots of laughter and clapping - if we had longer we would have given it a go!    As our flight was late in the day we were provided with a day room so we could relax completely - this was arranged willingly and efficiently and was very much appreciated. Also our exit cards were prepared for us so we didn't have to do it - one of the thoughtful things that make life a little easier    I would highly recommend and hope that you enjoy as much as we did!,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nospringchicken

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay Marrakech was just incredible buzzing colourful and we were at ease walking and exploring on our own though we did have a guide for a few hours to take us into the Souks and some of the architectural gems.

La Maison Arabe,Neil L wrote a review May 2013,50,Wish there were 6 stars: Simply without fault,We chose La Maison Arabe as it looked really authentic. The other reviews all sang praises and as one who writes good and bad reviews this ticked the boxes.    None of the other reviews say anywhere what this should say. I have travelled the world in 5star hotels but have never seen the level of attention we are getting here. Yes I write this from Hillel suite overlooking the pool as we go into our 4th and final night.    On arrival I knew you walked up an unassuming alley to a Riad made of many houses. But when you step inside this place has blown me away. My bags were taken no silly ticket a tour of the property and a fantastic drink delivered with love from the barman the bags a moment later.    The room is exquisite we are not in the largest suite or even have a balcony but the French doors are open a breeze is flowing in and the air conditioning is off right now. When we have used it the room is cool in minutes.    There are more wardrobes than we have at home the bathroom in marble with double sink ticks all my boxes. I have a thing about bathrooms you have to have a decent shower and great towels. La Maison Arabe not only has these but they are in plenty changed twice a day.    The room has complimentary bottled water replenished whenever you leave the room.    We have tried both restaurants not a single critique it was just right every time. The staff so friendly the manager has a 'nothing is too much trouble attitude' and passes this to the staff.    The Hammam well I think this was a little piece of paradise hiding in the lower ground floor. I will be back without question.    If there were 6 stars to give this would get them. Number 1 in Marrakech? Well we went to other 5 star hotels here and found they were just too pretentious for my liking. La Maison Arabe has been the most wonderful experience since we stepped off the plane and were met by their driver.,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NeilL770

The hotel is a beautiful relaxing oasis in the middle of a hot exciting and bustling city and it is a pleasure to arrive there and be greeted by courteous smiling staff. As soon as the wonderful staff found out about my birthday they went out of their way to make our stay very special.

La Maison Arabe,AmericanMacaroon wrote a review May 2013,50,Crème de la Crème!!,We had another enchanting stay at La Maison Arabe (our third) – our absolute favorite place to stay in the world. All the staff and the management team make us feel so special and do absolutely everything to make sure we have a wonderful visit every time. I don’t think you can find better service anywhere. We stay in hotels all over the world for our jobs and I am yet still to find anywhere that compares with the exceptional customer service and caring staff at this hotel.    The reception staff are incredibly helpful and very knowledgeable about what to do and where to go. The housekeeping staff are attentive and always seem to know when we have gone down to breakfast to come and clean our room.    The Breakfast staff are excellent and get you sorted out with anything that you need. The breakfast is so delicious with tons of choice for every palate. The food is fantastic at both restaurants as is the staff. We also love the jazz bar! If you like wine - make sure to try some of the outstanding Moroccan wines when you are at the hotel - they have a very good selection.    If you visit you have to go to the country club location –with beautiful gardens outdoor giant beds to sleep on and a mouth watering lunch menu – you can’t go wrong!    The spa is really lovely and the forfait Royal is one of the best treatments I have ever had and really great value for money. The girls who work at the spa are so sweet and the spa manager is lovely.    A special thanks to Slim Ibrahim and Hicham for the tagines and Nabila for the fantastic cream for my sunburn and Taoufik for spoiling us so much and making our visit so special!    We cannot wait to go back again and visit the paradise of La Maison Arabe!    Thanks to all the staff for making our visit so fantastic !!

La Maison Arabe,USFrance2 wrote a review May 2013,50,Another Wonderful Visit to La Masion Arabe!,It was our third trip to La Masion Arabe and each time we visit we are even more convinced that La Masion Arabe is the very best hotel in the world.    The staff’s attention to detail and truly caring attitude is exceptional. We were spoiled with kindness. It was my wife’s birthday and they knew without us saying anything and throughout the entire day she was wished happy birthday by every staff member in the hotel serenaded at breakfast and at dinner and spoiled with flowers and champagne. It was an unforgettable day and the wonderful staff at La Maison Arabe made it so special.    We love the Spa – the treatments are fantastic and the massages are out of this world and the Spa staff is amazing.    We ate again at the Moroccan and Poolside restaurants and the food continues to be top notch along with the staff. The breakfast is lovely – some new juices had been added this time (including cucumber and beetroot – which were delicious) and the breakfast staff absolutely fantastic as always – their smiling faces help start your day with happiness.    We even had a private tasting of whiskies with the General Manager in the jazz bar which was wonderful.    From the housekeeping staff to the reception staff and indeed every member of the Maison Arabe team there is a passion and kindness that I have not seen in any other hotel – their goal is to make sure you have everything and anything that you want or need.

Service excellent and staff very helpful cookery course fun. Location excellent to walk out to the souks and restaurants we really liked Marrakech and were not too bothered by the attentions of sellers and generally felt safe walking back even late at night.

It was such a wonderful experience at first glance when you are dropped off by the taxi and walk through the narrow ally you would bet apprehensive as to wht lays ahead. The minute the door is opened for you you will get engilfed into another world that you never expected to exist. The place is simply gorgeous and unique wheras the blend of traditional and contemporary amenities are married to perfection. Everybody from the doorbell to the General manager were super nice and helpful beyond belief. We did not get to try the restuarants but the complimentary buffet breakfast was very good with a blend of Moroccon and western selections and as usual staff that are very attentive to your evey move and need.

The inn is made up of several adjoining houses so be prepared for a lot of steps but we needed the exercise after the wonderful food. We stayed in Suite 216; very spacious with lots of light a comfortable balcony overlooking the pool and views of the garden from the sleeping area. Nice choice of amenities in the large bathroom drinking water was replenished as needed and lovely decor. After check-in we were given a tour of the hotel before being shown to our suite where our luggage had already been delivered. We dined in the Moroccan restaurant the first night and the food and service were excellent. The pace was leisurely without being slow. The breakfasts are a combination of buffet (don't miss the homemade yogurt) and eggs or Moroccan crepes cooked to order. Afternoon tea is included and they will serve capuccino if you prefer) along with fresh-baked pastries. We also attended the cooking class which was fun to do and we had the results for lunch. Dinner at the second restaurant Trois Saveurs was wonderful. The pool area was transformed with candles and beautiful lighting excellent food and service.

La Maison Arabe,PLR_Naarden wrote a review Apr 2013,50,I cannot imagine a better hotel in Marrakech,My wife and I stayed here for 8 days in one of their 12 suites. It was an oasis of tranquility inside the high walls surrounding this hotel consisting of 6 riads pieced together. At night we couldn't even hear the calls for prayer from the neighbouring mosque. So we didn't need the earplugs and slept very well in the comfortable king size bed. Breakfast in the patio besides the pool is a good start for the day with a wide selection of fresh local fruit juices yoghurt fruit salad eggs etc. This turns into a very romantic restaurant at night when the patio is covered by candlelight. The chicken tagine here can be highly recommended. Staff is extremely helpful and friendly and tries to accomodate as much as possible.  After a day of wandering through the streets and alleys of Marrakech it is very pleasant to be able the next day to relax in the hotel's country club outside the Medina with a good size swimming pool surrounnded by couches shaded by parasols and trees all in a beautiful setting. It is 15 minutes away by shuttle (once every hour) and here you can also enjoy a light lunch.  The location in town is almost perfect. It takes a stroll of at the most 10 minutes to reach the town's main square. Most restaurants are also within walking distance provided you have learned to navigate the alleys. We can recommend Le Jardin Le Foundouk and Maison MK. However taking a local dinner at one of the dinner stands in the main square especially on Friday evening is an experience in itself.  The front desk arranged for a car with chauffeur (Youssef who turned out to be an excellent driver) to take us on a day trip to the Atlas mountains which we found very worth while.,Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Naarden,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PLR_Naarden

La Maison Arabe,Michelle B wrote a review Apr 2013,50,Experience we will never forget,"This is the nicest hotel we have ever stayed in and we have stayed at 2 ""leading hotels of the world."" I read all of the wonderful reviews before going and found them all to be true. It is hard to top what Peter S said as he said it so well. There was so much beauty and detail to take in. The staff was so kind and helpful and everywhere people were waiting to serve you. The food was wonderful. We saw an article there that Winson Churchill used to regularly dine there. --We forgot our camera charger and our camera died. Adil the guest relation manager had a bellboy go out to buy us one. Since our camera was old they could only find a used one. It did not work. Imagine our surprise when we walked into the lobby and they had given us our money back as they sent the bellboy to return it. Then we purchased jewelry in a fixed price shop. Upon returning to the Riad we realized 2 stones were missing. Again Adil came to our resuce by calling them and explaining the situation to them and getting it taken care of for us to exchange it. One morning Adil greeting me with happy birthday wishes. How did he know? I guess when we signed in and had to fill out forms that included our birthdays and from that they took notice. Imagine my surprise that evening when 3 bellboys delivered a little cake to my room. Our favorite part was sitting in the garden restaurant overlooking the pool and listening to the musician playing the gentle Moroccan music. It was magical. Also the pool was heated and when we got out they served us tea by the pool. Tea and pastries are served each afternoon for free. We also took the cooking class and it was delighful and informative.

La Maison Arabe,Peter S wrote a review Apr 2013,50,Memorable stay,A beautiful hotel - exquisitely furnished and decorated spotlessly clean and always comfortable. A good location approximately 10 minutes walk to Djemaa el-Fna (once you figure out the best way!) and convenient for the Nouvelle Ville Souks and plenty of taxis passing nearby. The staff were brilliant and could not do enough to help - always polite friendly and approachable. I was even offered a herbal tea 'concoction' when they heard I was suffering from tummy troubles! We were given a free upgrade to a suite for our final two nights on account of it being our Honeymoon; both rooms were excellent.  Breakfast is a feast with a delicious and wide selection highlights being the fantastic home made yoghurt and made-to-order Moroccan pancakes!  We used the hotel's other leisure facilities which are a 20 minute (free) shuttle transfer away on the city outskirts. A nice place to relax with big comfy beds and a large (but cold!) pool and light snacks available.  We only dined once at the hotel's Moroccan restaurant but had a fantastic meal including the biggest fall-off-the-bone shoulder of lamb you will ever see! It was not a cheap option but for a special meal definitely value for money. The restaurant has got the ambience spot-on and the lute/guitar musicians playing background music added a real special touch.  The hotel has a number of informal seating areas which are lovely places for reading a book drinking afternoon tea or having early evening drinks. We also used the hotel pool on a few occasions and found it a lovely way to cool down and relax after a day walking the city!  We took part in the famous cookery class and had great fun cooking Moroccan salads chicken tagine with preserved lemons and olives and watching a bread making demonstration with the added bonus of eating the products of our labour for lunch after the session!

The hotel was incredible and from the minute we arrived we were blown away. The hotel's entrance is down a plain alley but once inside the hotel is stunning. There are lots of different rooms and levels and all exquisitely decorated. We had a patio suite in the old part of the building which formed an L shape room overlooking one of the pretty courtyards with two beds in the living area for the children. The service in the the hotel is second to none and our every need was catered for including simpler dining options for our 8-year old arranging excursions to the Atlas Mountains guides for the Medina and Souks as well as restaurant recommendations and travel arrangements. The food too is excellent we enjoyed the International restaurant and whilst venturing out to several other good restaurants in the city we found that the hotel's food and setting were hard to beat. Breakfast too was delicious with homemade yogurts fresh fruit salad pastries and pancakes/eggs cooked to order. In addition the Jazz bar was like stepping back in time to the 30s whilst the Country Club a short bus ride out of town was an oasis of calm and relaxation in a very busy city. We also did the cooking course at the hotel with our 12-year old daughter which was also excellent fun. The staff though are what makes this hotel so unique they are so warm and willing to make your stay very special.

I was expecting something ""adventurous"" and maybe a bit overwhelming at times but the trip was relaxed and wonderful from start to finish. We spent our first few days in the mountains before coming into the city to la Maison Arabe. We were met with exceptional service and friendliness. This hotel seems to have thought of everything. There are numerous quiet corners in which to relax curl up with a book or enjoy the sunshine. Our boys swam every day in the heated pool and we also went out to the ""country club"" a 15 minute drive from the hotel one day to swim in that larger (unheated) pool. Our room for the first 2 nights was the Royal Suite and it was unbelievable with a private roof deck with jacuzzi tub (!!) and huge luxurious spaces. The second two nights we were in 2 smaller rooms also lovely which shared a sunny outdoor courtyard.  The food at this hotel was fantastic - we ate twice at the ""traditional"" dining room and once in the other one. We didn't want to worry about food safety esp with children so we stuck to the hotel food. Our last day we did the cooking class which was terrific and fun.  I can't say enough about the quality of the service at this hotel. Staff were uniformly friendly and helpful without being annoyingly overattentive. We all felt completely at home here.

La Maison Arabe is the total package for a vacation destination - close to the adventure of the medina (market). No need for a car and I recommend you don't get one. Just take taxi or arrange for pick-up thru the hotel. The staff are all amazing and willing to assist their guests. The hotel's pools are refreshing and enjoyable to just look at. There are two: on property and another in the gardens which is accessible by courtesy transportation. The pool in the riad is refreshing after a day of negotiations in the market place. The spa...oh la la how wonderful. I went for the hammam and massage with my sister and we had a totally rejuvenating 2+ hours. It was hard to prepare for dinner within the property.

The furnishings are lovely too a nice desk artwork pillows etc. You have to be able to climb many stairs to get to the room -- they take your bags up as that would be a real impediment to any traveler with a large suitcase. But to go to breakfast you have to go up and down many staircases and some are circular and small steps. Nevertheless the climb is well worth the reward.

La Maison Arabe,Hasan C wrote a review Apr 2013,50,Great Marrakech experience,When I visit a country I try to stay in places where I find the country’s character culture and style. There are times that I even stayed at simple guest houses just to experience the local life. In Marrakech luckily I found La Maison Arabe to meet my expectations. Situated within walking distance to most of the places of interest in the city La Maison Arabe is a small boutique hotel (called “riad hotel” in Moroccan) with only 26 rooms. It was nicely and skillfully converted from an old arab house with a sympathetic swimming pool in the courtyard. The entrance is through a very narrow alley typical of Marrakech’s old “medina”. Above all the staff is extremely warm and friendly and very attentive. If you love to dine out of hotels I advise you to think twice because La Maison Arabe offers two separate fine-dining restaurants by the pool with outstanding menus including of course famous “tagine” varieties. If I had the time I would definitely have loved to take cooking lessons from the Chef. Yes dining there is not cheap but it is definitely worth the money.

We were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary and wanted to experience different types of accommodations. We had a picture in our minds of how a riad should look and La Maison Arabe didn't disappoint it's gorgeous. The food was very good the location convenient for everything the Medina has to offer and we had a lovely quirky room Sabah over the reception. At night all the public rooms patios restaurants and bars took on a magical ambiance especially around the pool area with candles and beautiful lantern lights everywhere. Oh and last but not least ALL of the staff we encountered were delightful.

The staff were very attentive and kind and always looked after us. For example they made sure that we didn't pay too much for taxis and other things. The rooms were lovely the heated pool was great and my wife really enjoyed the Hammam. It's not a long walk to the Djemaa al-fna and the Medina.

La Maison Arabe,Nick M wrote a review Mar 2013,50,A very special place with exceptional staff,Fantastic Riad.......with the most kind and friendly staff you could ever wish to meet.    This is NOTsome sterile hotel with staff wearing fixed smiles but more like a friendly home with genuinely happy staff wanting to help......a rare thing in this day and age !!!    We stayed here for 1 week and the welcome we received from the moment we stepped through the door to the day we left was truly exceptional and by the end of the trip we felt we were leaving friends behind.    The Riad is a beautiful place very elegant and a real oasis of calm from the busy streets of Marrakech. The food is superb from the poolside snacks to the restaurants. We had room service a few times and it arrived within 10 minutes of ordering .    The staff are always attentive and prompt but with the perfect balance of being available without hovering. Nothing was too much trouble.    We’d like to say a big thank you to Hi cham who met us on arrival with a cheerful smile genuine kindness and continued to help us during our stay. Also an added thanks to Nabila who arranged a special upgrade for us and all the rest of the staff who made our stay so special.    It is highly ranked on tripadvisor which is why we booked it and its ranking is justly deserved.    If ever there was a perfect example of great service with genuine friendliness.....then this has to be it.

The facilities and decor are superb and the country club is just beautiful. however what makes it the best hotel I've ever stayed in is the staff. the team of attentive friendly and efficient people who welcome you to their hotel is absolutely top class five star plus. I cannot think of a single thing they could do better. Food in the restaurant is good too and cocktails in the jazz bar are not to be missed. The traditional musicians playing at the candle-lit pool made all our evenings very special as we could enjoy them from our room as well as in the restaurant.

La Maison Arabe,TimmyTraveller wrote a review Mar 2013,50,Second time around - even better.,It's hard to know how to write this without you thinking I work for the hotel but it really is as good as anywhere I have stayed. They achieve a blend of remarkable service without it looking as though they're just going through the motions and combine this with a sense of humour and thoughtfulness.  This was our second visit and from the moment they picked us up from the airport (definitely take up this option it is worth the cost) and dropped us off again it was so relaxing each day moved at a snail's pace as we gradually de-stressed.  First of all the hotel is gorgeous and split into two halves. We stayed in the more traditional side where the rooms are a blend of all mod-cons and beautiful moroccan fixtures and artwork. There are also lots of little rooms where you can sit quietly with your mint tea or coffee or drink and read or look at some of the beautiful pictures. The weather was lovely which helped and they have a unique feature known as the country club where you can escape the medina and spend the day swimming and sunbathing in the hotel's own garden about ten minutes away by shuttle bus. It is absolutely lovely. The hotel has started to open it up to non-residents and I hope they will keep an eye on this because too many people will spoil the tranquility.  The restaurant is absolutely beautiful at night and attracts lots of non-residents as the quality of the cooking is so high. This time we felt that the menu was a little short on options if you were staying for more than three nights but again it is the kind of place where if you wanted something else they would do their best to accommodate you.  Two other things of note. The hotel has started to provide mobile phones to guests in case they get lost in the medina and need to be picked up. This is a superb idea. Also I was told that a particular guest who wanted to go to a hard to find restaurant was accompanied by a member of staff so she would not get lost on the way. It is touches like this which make the Maison Arabe the no1 rated hotel in Marrakech. I didn't realise how much I had enjoyed it until I got home - it really is superb and I cannot wait to return.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hampshire, UK",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TimmyTraveller
La Maison Arabe,CaroleW380 wrote a review Mar 2013,50,An Amazing place!,We have recently returned from a 3 night stay at the fabulous La Maison Arabe which was recommend to us by a friend - we were so impressed!  We were given an escorted guide around the riad on arrival followed by tea and pastries sitting by the pool in gorgeous sunshine which felt even more special having left England on a cold wet morning. Our room was spacious and elegantly decorated in Moroccan style with complimentary wine and water (the water was renewed each day). We looked out on the swimming pool and pretty garden area with olive trees and lanterns which when lit up in the evening was a beautiful place to be. There was so much attention to detail throughout the riad - pretty patios amazing lighting and reflections water features carved wooden doors and panels warm hues pretty seating areas and not only was the decor excellent but also the high standard of service. We were made to feel very welcome and nothing was too much trouble.  La Maison Arabe was a fantastic oasis of tranquility to return to after exploring the city.  We covered a lot of the tourist sights in the two days and ran out of time to try out the cookery school or visit the country club - it looks like we will have to return!

La Maison Arabe,AlisonsAunt wrote a review Mar 2013,50,Wonderful,A short late February stay in Marrakech led us to the wonderful 'La Maison Arabe' (guided there by the very helpful company 'Lawrence of Morocco'). Once through the door you enter another world where everything is beautiful and nothing is too much trouble for the charming and helpful staff. Our bedroom was stylish comfortable and immaculately kept. Fresh flowers and bottled water were welcome touches. We could only stay 2 nights and ate both nights at La Maison Arabe - not something we would normally choose to do when in a hotel. We were very happy that we did. Breakfasts by the pool were unhurried and totally delicious - if you are lucky your Moroccan crepe will be created for you by the wonderful lady who runs the cookery school. We hope to return and stay longer to try the cookery school and relax even more in the divinely-scented hammam.,Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlisonsAunt

La Maison Arabe,Zenobia B wrote a review Mar 2013,50,The Best in Town ?,"When intending to stay in Marrakech for the first time one can only rely upon advice from friends and information from the internet. One doesn't know if the facilities the ambience the service or the food would be better elsewhere but having stayed at La Maison Arabe in early march we can say that all were outstanding. The gamble paid off!    It is doubtful that any other hotel could match the welcome one receives and the courteous attention at all times from all the staff but one can say with some certainty that the hotel building itself and its interiors must be unmatched in Marrakech. Where a new hotel establishment may order fixtures fittings artefacts etc in bulk on a commercial basis here (as the history tells us) the aristocratic italian owner has had a hand in the selection of every item - and has done so with singular good taste and apparently with no expense spared. The combination of Moroccan artefacts and craftsmanship with Italian sensibilities and flair have created interiors of exceptional quality - for all guests to enjoy. If this is your interest it is a real treat.    One finds too that this visual feast is matched by one for the ears. Every evening one is entertained at dinner with lute guitar and the tremulous voices of the players (not to mention the pianist in the Jazz bar!) - not travelling musicians but masters from the academy of music in Marrakech no less. It doesn't get more exclusive than that!    It is so difficult to orchestrate the proceedings of a hotel with such seemingly effortless efficiency but here it is done with great success. Here in the UK we have the television series ""Faulty Towers"" to remind one just how difficult that is! Well done to management and staff. We shall be back for more.

La Maison Arabe,DJG_KAG wrote a review Mar 2013,50,Brilliant service and lovely hotel,In many ways I am just repeating others' views. Beautiful hotel lots of places to sit inside and out particularly lovely in the old part of the hotel. The service was exceptional - we felt welcomed and known throughout our 3 night stay. There were small problems all dealt with efficiently - WiFi didn't work and there was some time spent giving us different passwords to try before it did. Then we had a power cut - just in our room apparently and it was out for a couple of hours but we went to breakfast and were kept informed as it was sorted out. Finally an area power cut within the city was announced for the morning we left - it didn't affect us at all but all rooms had a personal letter of explanation. We also found a free bottle of champagne when we returned from dinner - assume this happened to everyone staying during the power cut. My only complaint was i didn't know it was coming so we left it untouched!  Would love to come back. Breakfast excellent Moroccan restaurant good but portions rather generous.

La Maison Arabe,andrew m wrote a review Mar 2013,50,Another fantatsic experience at the best hotel on Marrakech,Just returned from 6 nights at La Maison Arabe. Perfect ! We stayed in a Deluxe Suite Patio side which was great. We've previously stayed in one of the standard rooms. These are lovely too. We prefer the old part of the hotel but that's just our opinion...  My wife and I love Marrakech and this was our 5th visit in 7 years. We've spoken with many people who have visited the city and most seem to appreciate the vibrancy culture sights sounds and smells of the city. These can be fairly tiring...  La Maison Arabe is special because it offers the most beautiful mixture of style value and a particular approach to customer satisfaction. We have never stayed anywhere where it is possible to feel as welcome. As soon as you step in off the street into the quiet interior it's like coming home ( but nicer...)  The combination of absolutely central location fantastic decor and beautiful rooms would be enough. However for us the Kasbah Gardens are a key issue in making the difterence between La Maison Arabe and the other (some are very nice but not quite as special) top hotels in Marrakech . 15 minutes away in a free shuttle bus and you are in Paradise. We aren't big photograpers so check out some photos on the website.  Our considered and informed opinion is that La Maison Arabe is the ultimate combination. We spent our days mostly at the Gardens and our evenings in the Souks. Visit the Jazz Bar for a Cocktail and enjoy the local take on some classic tunes. Have a Hammam!

We stayed in a Royal Suite which had a private roof terrace and was just what we wanted for a 3 night break away from our children! The hotel restaurant (Trois Saveurs) is excellent - we ate Moroccan food here even though there is also a Moroccan restaurant because it's next to the pool in a lovely setting. We also did the half-day cooking course in the teaching kitchen next door which was great fun and well-taught. It included a trip to a local bakery (this was an eye-opener) and a spice shop. The Hammam is also first-rate. You won't be disappointed if you book this hotel and the staff are friendly and very helpful .Only one caveat - lock up your valuables in the safe provided.

La Maison Arabe,Rachel B wrote a review Mar 2013,50,Absolute Bliss!,This hotel is a little slice of heaven on earth! I have stayed in lots of hotels around the world but La Maison Arabe is by far my favourite. What sets it above the rest is the faultless service. Unlike so many hotels the staff are so genuine and really do want you to have the best possible stay in their city. From the moment you walk through the door of the hotel you become part of their family.    This combined with the stunning interior décor the wonderfully relaxed atmosphere the delicious food the perfect location and a hamman experience not to be missed makes this the best place to stay in Marrakech. And if this is not enough you have the opportunity of getting away from the heat and noise of the city and lazing by the pool at the spectacular country annex.    Our stay at La Maison Arabe last November was one of the best holidays I have ever had. After our first night stay in a basic room which was lovely and had everything we needed the hotel very kindly upgraded us. Due to me being a very light sleeper I found this room a little noisy so we were upgraded yet again. For some the idea of changing rooms three times in a four night stay might sound awful but it was actually great fun. With each of the rooms being uniquely decorated it was a great opportunity to experience a variety of them. And it was completely hassle free as whilst we were out enjoying the city the staff moved all our belongings.    I had always loved my visits to Marrakech; it’s such an exciting place.

It's a lovely charming and cozy hotel where stylish interior decors a la moroccan style please the eyes. We liked sitting at the courtyard and have our afternoon moroccan tea with delicious pastries and cookies.    But we were firstly impressed by the ultimate service quality of the hotel staff their friendliness and attentiveness throughout our stay. They assisted us in our special requests and went beyond our expectation.    The restaurant staff are so attentive and always wearing a smile on their face daily from the morning breakfast to the evening dinner. We remembered names like Badra for his everlasting smile and care (he gave me a blanket to keep warm from the chill at one morning breakfast) and Braahim as we always bumped into him within the hotel. But really all of them received equal commendation.    We tried the Hammon in the hotel and it was great. I took up the cooking workshop conducted by Wafaa and it was truly an enjoyable and fun culinary experience. My friend accompanied me but volunteered to take some pictures to document my culinary experience. She too enjoyed it! Wafaa has such a warm and pleasant personality. She also gave me a better understanding of the Moroccan culture.    La Maison Arabe contributed to one of the reasons why we have enjoyed Marrakech very much and would love to return back again.

La Maison Arabe,Judy T wrote a review Feb 2013,50,Deceiving Location,We had a car pick us up at the airport in Marrekech to take us to the Riad La Maison Arabe. The driver pulled into this alleyway that housed an appliance store with washing machines out side & nothing else in site but a few doors.. He stop & told us we had arrived. My husband & I looked at each other both of us showing much concern. We wondered what kind of place we had picked to stay in. Suddenly out of a narrow alley a bell hop appeared with the standard brass luggage cart. He took our luggage & told us to follow him down this very narrow alley. We then arrived at the most charming of small hotels. It is acutually a group of Riads that were put together to make a larger complex. We just loved the place. It is so charming. It is everything we pictured a Morrocan building to be. The place had many cozy sitting areas where you could enjoy a quiet snack or drink. It is decorated beautifully in the typical Morrish style so much so that I almost expected Humphrey Bogart to walk in. They have fireplaces in various locations always buring nicely on those chilly Morrocan nights & lots of candles lit to add to the ambience. Afternoon tea is gratis & is served to you wherever you like which could be in the comfort of your room also very beautiful decorated & serviced or in the court yard with its bubbling fountain in one of the cozy sitting rooms or by the pool which also offers a variety of diferent seating arrangements. The pool is beautiful & that is where your complimentary breakfast is served which is an excellent breakfast buffet offering the typical American European & Morrocan breakfast offerings. It is also where you can take lunch or have a very nice candle lit dinner feauturing some Morrocan style food but predominately international cusine which is very good. If you want a wonderful Morrocan dinner they have a beautiful Morrocan restaurant which is beautifully decorated in the Moorish style serving delicious Morrocan food. Every evening whether you are in the Morroccan restaurant poolside restaurant or the court yard their is a Morrocan muscian playing soft Morrocan music on various Morrocan musical instuments. Very romantic.  I also can't say enough about the wonderful service we received by all the very attentive staff. They even offered to have the bell hop walk us to a restaurant that was very difficult to find. It was in one of those hidden places that was in an alley off an alley off another alley off a main street. They were always very accomodating.  So after a hectic day in the extreme over sensory experience of the souks & the Medina (main square) the La Maison Arabe Riad is an beautiful oasis located in the old city just a few walking blocks from the Medina & all the sights.

La Maison Arabe,PRM_3London wrote a review Feb 2013,50,"""Amazing Marrakech Jewel""","We stayed at La Maison Arabe for 8 days and can only describe our experience as ""heaven on earth"". Whatever I write will never be able to do the staff the ambience and the hotel justice but here goes... All the staff are truly amazing and the service is unsurpassed. The difference between everyone at La Maison Arabe and other 5 start hotels around the world is that they provide service ""from the heart"" you are truly made to feel like a part of their family. Every need and requirement is anticipated and delivered with an honesty and smile that we have not experienced anywhere else.    This started on arrival. We were welcomed by Adil the Manager who was extremely warm and friendly and made us feel at home instantly. Adil also helped us make the most of our trip to Marrakech by providing recommendations on how to get around easily and ""must see"" attractions.    We had a Hamman in the hotel fantastic. We ate in the hotel every evening...glorious food in all restaurants! We took the trip to ourika valley...not to be missed! I did the cooking course with Wafaa....again not to be missed as it's more than just a cooking course it's a true insight to Morrocan culture.    We don't want to single anyone out as everyone is very special but we really have to shout about the Restaurant Manager...Badra. Badra is an amazing human being!. He never stops smiling and really made us feel very special. From my surprise birthday cake (and wonderful singing by the staff!) to packing us some Moroccan pastries to take to the airport! On grey days in London the memories of Badra's smile and all at La Maison Arabe (and the dream that we will one day return) will help us through!

La Maison Arabe,LaraDavid8 wrote a review Feb 2013,50,A Unique & Special Memory,My wife and I had the distinct pleasure of staying at LA MAISON ARABE; a unique and special memory that literally with be with us forever.    For our honeymoon we decided to visit Morocco with one of our destinations being Marrakech. At first we were unsure where to stay as there were two other highly rated luxury hotels in the area we were considering. Our goal was to holiday in a visually unique riad that embraced the textural beauty of the city; to be pampered with high-level honeymoon-rate services; and yet still experience an intimacy that wasn’t big hotel but instead local warm kind yet exemplary.    After consulting with a travel agent we selected LA MAISON ARABE and we cannot have made a better decision to remember our first days of marriage! We cannot – with ease – distinguish which of the features we experienced was the best in that they were all above and beyond our expectation.    We stayed in a private roof terrace Nour Suite 222 which immediately felt like home. In fact while we so enjoyed the immaculate day and evening dining around the reflective pool we loved our room so much we even took dinner on the terrace one evening. And regardless of our excursions we rushed back “home” for tea and cookies daily.    This feeling of home and welcome was only encouraged by the staff and particularly management who take exceptional pride in not just the daily operations but in the desire that the guest takes back a positive and long lasting memory of the hotel to wherever they call home.    Separately we would like to thank the general manager Taoufik for most generously helping me arrange a one of a kind and uniquely special gift to my wife which has enabled us to cherish the memory of our honeymoon at LA MAISON ARABE forever.    Do choose LA MAISON ARABE anytime you are in Marrakech and feel free to send me a personal email with any further questions.,Date of stay: May 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,New York City,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaraDavid8

Each and every one of the hotel's staff was friendly helpful and always smiling. There was never a need unanticipated or unmet. The meals were delicious and the hotel itself stunning. A return trip is on the list! A special mention goes out to Rashid the bartender in the Jazz Bar who effortlessly entertained our 8 and 11 yo while we had a glass of wine. He let them make their own fruit cocktails and even try their hands at helping guests. Our son cried when we left!

La Maison Arabe,marcs47berlin wrote a review Feb 2013,50,Best Experience Ever!,My girlfriend and I had the experience of our lives at La Maison Arabe! Entering from the small alleyway into an oasis of comfort pleasure and sensation we were greeted with exceptional and friendly service and a lovely and romantic atmosphere. Rooms are wonderful adorned like the hotel itself with unique local objects of great quality. The food at the hotel restaurant was the best we had in all of Moroccoin fact among the best we had anywhere! And the spa in the basement of the hotel was incredibly relaxing with excellent informed service and fine cosmetics. As if this wasn't enough the hotel also offers free shuttle service (only 10-15minutes away) to its own private outdoor oasis–a gorgeous secluded garden with private swimming pool delicious food and world class elegance. When we were there only a few other guests joined us so we had this spacious garden and poolside area almost all to our selves! The combination of the Riad (which also has a swimming pool!) and the country garden atmosphere make La Maison Arabe a singular experience! This kind of comfort and elegance is just what one needs when returning from the hustle and bustle of the Marrakech Medina.

As a rule we don't normally bother with feed back but this is an exception.

La Maison Arabe,Claire656 wrote a review Feb 2013,50,Highly recommend,It was our first time to Marrakech and our honeymoon so we got very lucky finding this riad. We were upgraded and were treated like royalty during our stay. We spent three nights here before going to Essaouira for 4 nights and returning to Marrakech for our final night. We hadn't booked anywhere for our final night but after our first stay were in no doubt - straight back to La Maison Arabe for our final night. Staff were incredible and we got such a warm welcome when we returned. One evening when we were in the bar they dimmed the lights and brought in the musician from the restaurant to play for us and presented us with a beautiful cake to say congratulations. A complete surprise and really special.

La Maison Arabe,mdean09 wrote a review Feb 2013,50,An Oasis in The Medina,Having now stayed here I can fully appreciate the number of excellent reviews that the place has achieved here on TP.    Stayed at this magnificent hotel/ riad during my recent 30th birthday and what a wonderful place to spend it at! Secretly hidden down a small little street away from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech from the second we opened the door the staff treated us like like long lost friends providing the most fantastic and friendliest service we have ever experienced at any hotel - no request ever to small.    After a brief tour of the hotel we were taken to our well presented room which overlooked the swimming pool/ restaurant area and provided a view of the minaret next to the nearby mosque.    Breakfast served by the pool and under large standalone heaters to take away that February morning chill consists of pastries fresh fruits and juices cereals and freshly made breads omelettes and crepes - washed down perfectly with mint tea.    To echo many of the other great reviews the restaurants are exceptional serving the best lamb tagine we have ever eaten. Great gesture from the staff during dinner on my birthday to give me a cake and cocktail. Really made the trip.    The location is perfect for a leisurely stroll to Jemaa El Fna or to the new part of the city just outside the city walls.    Only things we didn't do due to time we're the cooking course (but from the aromas from the cooking class - I am beginning to wish we had) and didn't use the Hammam.

Pool was great as was afternoon tea. Staff were unbelievable ; I was reading my book in a little hallway one morning and after about 5 mins the bellboy came to start a fire in the fireplace just for me ! We ate at both restaurants. The Moroccan was fantastic the tasting menu was wonderful. Waiter did add an extra 450 MAD for a bottle of wine we did not have but this was quickly rectified. Ate at the pool restaurant our 2nd night- it was less stuffy and was fantastic as well.

La Maison Arabe,Lazzagear wrote a review Feb 2013,50,A wonderful service experience,From beginning to end of our long weekend stay at La Maison Arabe the service couldn't be faulted. Every member of staff seemed to genuinely care about our wellbeing and went out of their way to help - from restaurant recommendations (when they wrote a list so we could 'check out the reviews online') to handing over filled-in departure cards as we left for the airport we have never experienced such thoughtful care. The barman even chased us round the hotel because we hadn't experienced his delicous 'welcome drink' .    Breakfast every morning was around the pool with outdoor heaters if it was a little chilly (it was January). The breakfast was good but as someone who doesn't like pastries I found it limited. That said my husband enjoyed it and the coffee was excellent    Unusually we ate in both restaurants and the food was the best we enjoyed during our trip. The Morrocan restaurant was atmospheric with lovely decor and Andalusian guitarists playing softly in the background. Les Trois Saveurs offered a mix of Moroccan and International cuisine and the latter was excellent. They even supplied a birthday cake for my husband without any request.    The rooms are beautifully appointed some in the original old wing and some in a more modern block overlooking the pool. We were in the original riad rooms which I preferred although our room - Doha - was very small and cramped. We had a nice patio outside where tea and delicious cakes were served every afternoon.    Marrakech is a great destination for a winter break. At the end of January the days were sunny and warm (around 23 degrees in the sun) and the nights were clear and cold. And the Maison Arabe is the perfect place to stay. We will return.,Date of stay: January 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lazzagear

Souks and the medina were very interesting. Although you do get harassed into buying things and you will definitely get lost. You will get a good bargain though as the stuff is really cheap compared to England.

La Maison Arabe,USFrance2 wrote a review Jan 2013,50,Wow!! Heaven on Earth......,My wife and I have stayed at La Maison Arabe twice so far and we absolutely love this hotel. It should be rated number 1 in Marrakesh – it is by far the best hotel we have stayed in bar none (and we travel most of the time and have stayed in many 5 stars hotels around the world). The staff is charming kind and very knowledgeable. Their main concern is to make guests feel welcome and they do everything in their power to make sure we had a lovely time.    The staff speaks excellent English and this hotel is a perfect choice for anyone (families couples and singles) and for a first visit or returning visit to Marrakesh. The front desk staff is very knowledgeable and incredibly helpful.    The location is fantastic – in the Medina but also in a private oasis for those that would like to rest from the hustle and bustle of the Medina.    The country club is incredible and I highly recommend you visiting the country club when you stay. The spa and the spa staff are out of this world. For the many spa’s we have visited around the world for us this is an experience above the rest. The restaurants and the bar at this hotel are top notch and the staff work very hard to make sure you are happy.    It makes me sad to see someone make a negative comment about his hotel. I know of course all are entitled to their own opinion but the hotel and the staff are so wonderful I can’t imagine someone not having an excellent visit. I do hope that a competitor would not go so low as to write a bad review.

She won out and I was ready to prove her wrong. I must admit she  was right on this one. La Maison Arabe bills itself as a riad/hotel whereas it is much  much larger than I expected. It seems to be a series of different riads and buildings  put together yet everywhere my wife had that cozy feeling she was hoping to get from  a typical riad. We enjoyed exploring the hotel and discovering something new every  day. The front desk personnel were very helpful in organizing our stay in Marrakech.  Very friendly and professional staff everything done with a smile and one that seemed  sincere and not forced. The staff seemed happy which is a sign of a good establishment.  We loved our suite in the older part of the hotel. Although there were many stairs to reach  it it was a joy to retreat up there to our private terrace every afternoon.

La Maison Arabe,manytravels_11 wrote a review Jan 2013,50,Haven of calm within the Medina,What a fabulous hotel! We spent four nights here (19th-22nd Jan) away from the cold and snow in warm sunny Marrakech. The hotel is in traditional Morrocan Riad style and decorated beautifully with Islamic style artwork. The staff are so friendly and efficient. They remember your name your room number your drinks order - everything. The two restaurants (one traditional Morrocan the other more international) serve a very high standard of cuisine and the Morrocan wines are excellent. We attended the Cookery School and although quite hard work we learned how to make tagine which was then our lunch. Another great place in the hotel is the Jazz Bar where Rachid makes everyone feel so welcome. The hotel arranged for a registered guide to take us to the souks and palaces and he was so informative and friendly we had a great time. The guide also arranged for us to take a horse-drawn carriage ride to the New Quarter outside the Medina where we saw a completely different side to Marrakech.

La Maison Arabe,Estrella187514 wrote a review Jan 2013,50,An incredible experience,A group of friends spent a wonderful weekend at the Maison Arabe. As soon as you arrive you realize that your stay is going to be an incredible experience. We have felt as we were at our house or even better due to the excellent service provided by all the staff at the hotel at the reception restaurant room service breakfast. They supported us when we wanted to arrange a short tour with a very professional Spanish guide really an excellent selection from their side. We also had dinner at the Marroquian restaurant the first night of our arrival and it was so nice…the atmosphere at the restaurant brings you to old years and make you feel really relax. The food was also incredible we chose the degustation menu a very good selection of dishes. We also had a Hamman experience at the hotel we choose the Royal Hamman highly recommended. And what to say about the rooms there are no words to describe how we felt. The staff has tried to make us feel as “queens” every time. Be prepared for the breakfast experience close to the swimming pool and with the best home-made jams you have ever tasted. One of our friend asked for soja milk during the breakfast and although they did not have it they found the way to get it immediately. This is the kind of details that make the difference. All the recommendations provided by the hotel team were very useful during our stay. If you go there you will be in the best hands for sure.

Our suite was exceptional  and they provided a proper bed for our teenager. The place is a real sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech just a ten minute walk from the square. The manager and all the staff were extremely helpful with nothing being too much trouble. Breakfasts were delicious and served by the pool.

La Maison Arabe,Ali K wrote a review Jan 2013,50,Number One Riad!,Out of our whole trip in Morocco this was our number one Riad! The ambiance of the hotel had a Moroccan theme. The suite was wonderful! It had a spacious balcony which opened into the beautifully decorated courtyard a huge bathroom and a large closet! Upon arrival the room was covered in rose petals when we entered and they gave us dates to eat. We then had dinner reservations at one of the restaurants and the food was simply delicious and exotic! The next morning we were greeted with an elaborate breakfast buffet consisting crepe and eggs made to our liking. After a long day of walking in the souks we treated ourselves to a spa/Hamam. The experience was very relaxing and rejuvenating. The managers of the hotel Aadil and Ibrahim were extremely helpful and courteous! They went out of our way to make sure we were comfortable and satisfied. Another plus side to this hotel is that there was free wifi in the rooms. All in all this hotel went beyond our expectations!

It is absolutely fabulous: very friendly but discrete staff gorgeous rooms and delicious meals. And to top this their spa and hammam is out of this world. I did not want to leave. The location in the old city is perfect as well as while it is very central it is not part of the crazy busy Souks. We would definitely go there again if we had the opportunity. Prices given the service and what we would have paid in a comparable hotel in Europe was also reasonable.

La Maison Arabe,Jack R wrote a review Jan 2013,50,"In the Heart of Marrakech, and Not Just Location","We found La Maison Arabe to be of fully five-star quality and in three important dimensions. Location: it is an oasis of beauty and comfort in the Medina the old city easy walking distance to major must-see sights. Facilities: superb combination of several old Riad mansions including graceful dining in arcades flanking the pool and surprisingly well-equipped stations for the fun cooking class. We found the food to be uniformly excellent. And in the softly lit Hammam we were treated like robed royalty. Service: this was the crowning touch starting with the warmth of Nabila Dakir the general manager. Managers usually inhabit a back office managing staff by direction. She endeared us by how she manages by example responding instantly to -- even anticipating -- our slightest request. We received smiles and courtesy from everyone on the staff. An example: When Nabila learned that my husband was struggling with bronchitis she instantly provided restorative ""grog."" And the next morning Salima our server at breakfast not only provided more but wrote out the recipe. By the end of our six days we were sad to leave a place where we had been made to feel like family.",Date of stay: January 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/284JackR

Amazing decor beautiful & comfy rooms great ambience throughout the hotel and impeccable service.    Our room was on the second floor with a balcony overlooking the pool (room 244). Terrific room large good closet space nice view overlooking the pool and outdoor restaurant/lounge area. It does get loud at night because of the music from the bar and restaurant but it's not the bad and it does go too late.    The service is terrific. Everyone at the front desk is so wonderful. We spent our last day in Marrakech on our own so had a lot of questions and the front desk was so helpful.    The riad is just beautiful itself lots of sitting areas nooks definitely walk around and experience all of it.    We had breakfast here really good the best was the woman who sat outside making the Morroccan bread/stuffed crepes to order delicious! Dinner is also excellent especially sitting outside overlooking the pool.    My friend and I loved the spa too we did the traditional hammam which was different but I really liked it and the spa itself is just lovely.

The staff were all excellent and obliging. Nothing was too small or too large for them to assist us with. The food was undoubtedly some of the best we have eaten anywhere. Contrast this with some of the huge and indifferent hotels in and around the ""New Town"" as we did and you will be very pleased you chose our hotel unless that is you like clueless staff and no service as in La Palmeria where we went in search of a Japanese restaurant. We ended up back at our hotel and a free glass of champagne offered by our hotel Director who ensured we got a meal even though both his restaurants were fully booked. That's what I call service. The hotel would benefit from a gym and I believe one is planned for 2014 in their country club a short and free taxi ride away. La Maison Arabe is full of beautiful pictures and ornaments and has a heated quite large swimming pool with an even larger but unheated pool at their country club.

We had a chamber which was beautiful romantic and very well kept it was room 228. It was maintained very well throughout the stay the receptionist would organise eveything for you upon request. the Riad being of 26 rooms meant that they can give a special personal attention to all clients of the Riad.

The room is clean and spacious with a big bed and good bathroom. The only point of improvement is the shower which does not have enough pressure (but it is not bad at all).  The hotel service is extraordinary the staff is very helpful and they are very concerned with our experience. We certainly recommend the Hotel's Hammam (the Moroccan bath). One little tip is for the breakfast. It is great but it lacks some ""sweet"" options -- nothing to dampen the quality of the breakfast. I would certainly stay in this hotel again.

I took the courtesy bus to the country club 15 mins drive away to relax by the pool with my book and complimentary cocktail whilst he went from office to office. We checked out of our room at noon. Our flight was not till 8pm so they allowed us to use the Royal suite to change and freshen up. Afternoon tea and the IHT at breakfast are little extras that make all the difference.

On arrival the hotel frontage isn't in any way ostentatious and is relatively small and unassuming. It's only when you enter the building that you realise how wonderful the hotel is.    The hotel has its own swimming pool 3 restaurants and a number of rooms; which are spread across 2 floors.    We stayed in one of the junior suites and it was a spacious room with all of the things you'd expect such as minibar and air con Etc.    We ate in their Moroccan restaurant on our first night and the food was really good. Breakfasts are buffet style and are again really good.    Didn't get to try the pool sadly as it was 10 degrees outside and was very cold!    The hotel is also well situated in the medina and we got a guide from the hotel to walk us round the labyrinth of souks and to also show us the historic buildings. (Half a days worth of tour cost about £25 and it was well worth the money)    We ate at Le Foundouk one evening and the food there was a delight. Would really recommend this as part of your stay. The hotel sorted out the booking for us.    All in all this was a great first time trip to Marrakech and it was made even better by and excellent hotel with super friendly staff!

This riad also had a country club where a courtesy bus would leave on the hour to take you to the outskirts of the city to a beautiful swimming pool set in an exotic garden where drinks and snacks were also served. This was a fantastic facility that other riads did not offer. Try this riad - you will not be dissapointed. - amanda holt,Date of stay: November 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CatHolt

Staff outstanding - never experienced better. My only cricicism would be the 5.30 am alarm call from the morning call to prayer which woke us all every day. But if you complain about this you should probably stay in leafy Surrey.    Morocco is a fascinating country - safe polite relatively little hassle factor. Highly recommended if you would like to experience another culture but find the thought of India or Egypt a little overwhelming.

La Maison Arabe,Si_and_AliJ wrote a review Oct 2012,50,Dinner and Cocktails at Maison Arabe,Our Riad recommended Maison Arabe for dinner. It was just round the corner down one of the alleys that are so typical of Marrakech. Once inside though it is difficult to believe something so beautiful and tranquil could be hidden behind the grotty walls. We had pre dinner drinks in the Jazz Bar. The service excellent and dinner was delicious. We sat by the pool with a heater as it was a little chilly and my wife was offered a blanket too.  We enjoyed ourselves so much that we returned for our final night dinner.  We'd especially like to thank the barman in the Jazz Bar. His cocktails were amazing and his house special was especially fab with a cheeky vodka added. He made us feel most welcome and nothing was too much trouble even when the bar got a bit busy he made sure we were enjoying ourselves and weren't neglected. Our only regret is that we didn't get his name in order to give him a more personal mention.,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Si_and_AliJ

The cookery course was also incredibly well organised. The food and service was also excellent. Our children (11 & 13 yrs) loved the experience.

La Maison Arabe,Salah_Al-Abbadi wrote a review Oct 2012,50,Absolutely amazing hotel!,Let me first say that I have been to a few hotels in Morocco that have looked pretty enough but have had horrible service. Not so at La Maison Arabe. Not only is the hotel beautiful but the service is impeccable. Everyone is incredible friendly and polite even when we had a fussy and at times troublesome 3 year old running around (they were incredibly patient with her and played with her often). The hotel offers a cooking class which my wife took the chef would take you to a nearby market and show which ingredients to pick and then show you how to cook them at the hotel kitchen. The breakfast buffet is amazing and their restaurant has great food and Tajine. The rooms are spacious and clean (the room gets cleaned twice a day!).

Here is the deal in a nutshell:    Fantastic:  1 - The building/rooms----oozing with atmosphere. You really feel like royalty in Morocco. (Rooms are spacious and quiet)  2 - The service - So helpful so gracious in every way. I'm not kidding!  3 - 5* Moroccan restaurant - Fabulous food nice music impeccably decorated.  4 - Location - Right in the middle of the Medina...perfect!  5 - Lap pool - It is a heated pool but unfortunately was not heated during our stay. We still swam laps but it was cold.  6 - Excellent Hamam/spa  7 - Fun hands-on cooking class resulting in an excellent meal.  8 - Some fantastic Moroccan wines    Minor issue:  1 - Breakfast is understaffed. They are set up to serve you but are unable to since there is really only one person doing all the work including making eggs. As a result people are constantly trying to help themselves with difficulty. Food quality was good though.  2 - Also no gym but there is park (Cyber-park) a few blocks away that you can run in,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"San Francisco, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelpal32489

For anyone who wants to learn to cook Moroccan food the half day cookery courses are great fun and an excellent introduction to the art of cooking with a tagine.

The facilities include a poolside restaurant and a bar with fabulous Moroccan wine. We also took the cooking class and we highly recommend it. Wafa was our instructor and Fatima was the assistant.

La Maison Arabe,K A wrote a review Oct 2012,50,"Authentic Moroccan and Classy Riad, Superb service",I stayed in this excellent hotel/Riad in September 2012 and I have to say this is one of the best accommodations I've ever stayed in. The service was not only the best service I've gotten in Morocco (and I've been around in Casablanca Tangier Rabat Oujda Ouarzazate all in branded hotels); the service was first class by international standards. The staff were all friendly and helpful all spoke excellent English with nothing but smiles on their faces. The amenities were great too the hotel restaurant had really good selections and not just local Moroccan dishes (which were also really good). In fact my wife was able to join their live cooking classes they have twice daily and it was a great experience for her; they even went out to buy the ingredients fresh with the chef instructor (the class was free by the way even with the final product which is a free gift). The breakfast was good with modest selections up to international standards with a homemade yogurt that was really good! The hotel apparently has a separate country club which I assumed was a spa and health center in a different building they have a shuttle that leaves to and fro every hour (i didn't check it out but I assume is great). The best part was the excellent attention to detail in design you really feel like you're back in time at some Andalucian high class palace or something. My room opened up to a small roof-less enclosure with a very small fountain in the middle with actual roses floating in the basin; the enclosure had nice furniture to sit on and enjoy some afternoon tea and snacks after a day of sightseeing (which the staff would suggest when we would come in). The room itself was decorated with beautiful oil paintings and nice furniture designed to look like antiques. The room was fully equipped to international standards. The location of the hotel is doesnt do it justice because it seems like any other ally in crowded Marrakech but its actually a 10 minute walk from the Medina and all the best sights in Marrakech (which you shouldn't miss while visiting). Do check out this hotel it's pricey but definitely well worth the money...,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KA780
La Maison Arabe,WestSussexCaroline wrote a review Oct 2012,50,Best hotel we have visited,This hotel is wonderful. From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty. The service is impeccable. It is a charming place where modern comforts blend harmoniously with the most typical and age-old elements of local tradition. We were only there for a long weekend which was not enough to experience everything that the hotel had to offer. We did not use the wonderful spa or learn in the cookery school but we certainly hope to go back and try these facilities. The main swimming pool is at the hotel's country club. A courtesy bus leaves the hotel each hour for a 15 minute drive which takes you passed the Royal Palace to a peaceful haven. We spent the morning exploring the city and relaxed in the afternoons at the tranquil pool and beautiful gardens. Again the service is impeccable as the Country Club staff are informed who is on the bus. They are waiting to welcome you and provide you with a sunbed and towel in whatever area you want. They also have large sofa style double beds under partial shade as well as conventional sunbeds. There is a poolside bar which offers a delicious light lunch. There are two restaurants in the hotel and we tried the taster menu in the Moroccan restaurant on the first night which gave us a very good sample of different Moroccan flavours. The second night we eat in the international resturant that provided a Moroccan menu as well as European food with a French slant. The food is fantastic. On the day we had to leave they asked us if we would lke a hotel car to take us to the airport. The cost of this added to the bill and saved the hassle of haggling with a taxi driver.

La Maison Arabe,Jolleys wrote a review Oct 2012,50,Excellent choice for a Marrakech experience,Having just returned from 4 nights in La Maison Arabe (MA) we were satisfied that we had enjoyed a fantastic short break in Marrakech which had exceeded our expectations. We had chosen the perfect place to stay within the Medina walls and a short walk to the hustle & bustle of the main square and the souks. Our suite in the older part of the Riad had a typically Morrocan feel which made you smile every time you walked through the door. The bed was extremely comfortable the bathroom beautiful and the room was so peaceful (except the occasional calls to prayer from the local mosque!!!). We are generally the type of travellers that like to explore the local area during the day and find local restaurants to eat in at night which we did for the first 3 days but on our last full day we decided to have a Hammam treatment in the Riad spa and dine in the Morrocan restaurant at MA in the evening and what a perfect day it was ending with the Morrocan tasting menu which was exceptional and showed us that the Riad also has top class dining facilities as well as top class accommodation. We also made use of the Country Club 15 minutes away some afternoons which was only for MA guests and this really was an oasis outside the Medina with a lovely pool drinks & food available reached via a courtesy bus leaving every hour to and from the Riad. The staff were always smiling and friendly and the general service was excellent in every aspect of the Riad.

But in this lovely hotel we never felt like anything but family. I loved all the beautiful knick-knacks and the carved plaster. The food was delicious. We ate in all of the restaurants and the bar. I wanted to try everything on all of the menus because everything was so yummy. We even went out to the country pool for an afternoon. The gardens there were lovely and I loved listening to and watching all the birds that flit around the pool and cafe. We splurged for a spa treatment too and it was so relaxing that we just decided to sit around the pool for the rest of the day instead of venturing out of the hotel. The staff was really sweet to us.

Having recently experienced a stay in a true riad it was very civilised to be able to have a pre dinner drink in the bar while we perused the restaurant menu. The restaurant itself was in a lovely setting and the food was good. It was easy and relaxing to go to dinner without leaving the hotel. We thought we'd died and gone to heaven when we spent the day at the country club. The service there was outstanding. Perhaps we didn't choose our room too wisely as it was very narrow and we were woken by the pre dawn call to prayer each night. There is a mosque close by.

La Maison Arabe,hattie p wrote a review Sep 2012,50,Charming spot!,My goodness! My sister took me to Marrakech for my 65th birthday...a sort of senior citizen Carrie Bradshaw trip. We read the reviews for this place and decided this was the one. To say Marrakech was a culture shock for 2 Iowa girls raised on a farm is an understatement! But we never expected to be so welcomed as we were especially at La Maison Arabe. It started life many years ago as a famous Moroccan restaurant and was turned into this charming little hotel by an Italian prince. We felt like princesses here. The service was so special and they were very helpful to us oldsters and attentive to our needs. The rooms were so beautiful and the food was delicious. I have to admit we were a little worried visiting Morocco but we never had anything more bothersome than an agressive shopkeeper. The tone of our trip was nicely set by our welcome at this hotel. I would stay here again without any hesitations.,Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Grinnell, Iowa",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hattiep_12

La Maison Arabe,Helen C wrote a review Sep 2012,50,A haven of tranquility amid the hustle and bustle,From the moment we were greeted from the airport and chauffeur driven to the Maison Arabe we knew we were going to be staying at a fine place. We walked down a narrow alley way and then through a small side door and were bowled over by its warm surroundings and friendly staff. We had a welcome drink in the courtyard and then a tour of the hotel. It was a maze of rooms ranging from a elegant spa sophisticated jazz bar and relaxing pool area. It was friendly smart but not formal. A great combination.  The country club is a must!  Ishlam on reception was so helpful.

La Maison Arabe,GarethAdams wrote a review Sep 2012,50,A tranquil spot in the middle of town,We felt we were in safe hands the moment we walked in and were ushered over to sit by the pool and served a refreshing orange and carrot juice.  We were in one of the Royal Suites and the room was fantastic. Comfortable well thought through and with large very clean bathrooms. The roof terrace was the reason we went for the Suite and it was just perfect. We had breakfast there every day looking across the rooftops of Marrakesh and it was the ideal spot for some private sunbathing - and it had a jacuzzi!  The main hotel restaurant in the evening was like a film set. Arranged around the pool subtly lit and with wonderful food it was a terribly romantic dinner making us both feel very special.  Staff were extremely helpful and efficient - the climb up to the roof terrace to carry up our breakfast was always undertaken with good grace - and at some speed.  The hotel is very convenient for the centre of town.,Date of stay: May 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Tunbridge Wells, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GarethAdams

It was a surprise finding it tucked away in the back streets - it's really convenient for Djemaa el Fna but also a pleasant stroll away from the mayhem. The staff at every level were incomparable absolutely charming and lovely and nothing was too much trouble they even filled in our departure cards long before we needed them so they were ready for our return flight! The shuttle to the Palmerie piscine proved a lifesaver after the bustle and heat of the medina. I really hope we can return one day. If I had a criticism it was that they were so on top of things we felt they were changing our towels before we had even had time to use them - we would have been happy to hang them back up for reuse but there was no provision for that and I think if you want to help save resources you should be given the opportunity.

Sunday 9th September 2012  Pre meal drinks in the Piano / Jazz Bar  2 x Morrocjitos - as mixed by the Cocktail Mixerpretty good and very minty  2 x Bombay Sapphires and Tonic  2 x Casablanca Beers    Meal  1 x bottle of Medallion Sauvignon  1 x Goats Cheese with Duck Breast and 1 x Chicken and Almond Pastilla  1 x Lamb Tagine and 1 x Chicken and Dried Peach Tagine  1 x Creme Brulee and 1 x Apple and Cinamon Torte    The wine was a nice introduction to Morrocan whites and we ended up buying two bottles at the Airport Duty Free to bring home.    I think the full bill came to 1600 Dirahams - £120.00 + tips probably just about worth it and the setting is really nice as long as you get a table by the pool. Not too busy on the Sunday and the service was great. Food was excellent    Friday 14th September    We had deceided to eat here again before we left and booked a table for the Friday evening and left enough time to sepnd an hour in the Piano / Jazz Bar beforehand.    Pre Meal Drinks  Pink Lady and Mai Tai  Bombay Sapphire and Tonic and Casablanca    Meal  1 x Medallion Sauvignon  1 x Goats Cheese and Duck Breast and 1 x Carrot Cumin Honey and Corainder Soup  1 x Grilled LEg of Lamb with Vegetable Flan and 1 x Lamb and Orange Tagine  1 x Ice Cream and 1 x Dried Fruit Pastilla    Back to the bar for a G&T and an Irish Nut (Baileys and Amarreto)    The bill was about 1600 Dirahams plus another 300 Dirahams I think.

La Maison Arabe,Mrs_SS wrote a review Sep 2012,50,Perfect!,We have just returned from 5 days at the wonderful La Maison Arabe what a fantastic place! In amongst the madness of Marrakech is this haven of peace and tranquility made even better by the staff who are just amazing nothing was too much trouble they are the best. Having read the comments on Tripadvisor I had very high expectations these were not only met but far exceeded. The location is ideal a few minutes from the souks and 5-10 mins from the main square. The hotel is beautifully decorated and authentically Moroccan some reviewers have noted its a tiny bit worn in places but this is really minimal and if anything adds to the experience. We used the pool at the hotel a couple of times and then relaxed on the loungers on the terraces we also went to the country club 15 minutes away which is a delight and so peaceful it feels like you're in your own private sanctuary. The food was lovely we ate there on our first night on the remaining nights the staff helped us book restaurants and organised taxis so that we wouldn't be overcharged. It is also spotlessly clean. We also experienced the hammam and massage - amazing!

La Maison Arabe,Michael076 wrote a review Sep 2012,50,Still a top place to stay,Very happy to return to La Maison Arabe after a first visit last year although a bit disappointed that my room this time was right next to the room we had last time so I didn't get to see more of the place. But this room was insulated from the pre-dawn call to prayer so that issue the only negative from my last visit went away.    This time I visited the off-site pool which was a great respite from the +40 degree heat. Non alcoholic drinks are available charged to one's room.    The breakfast is now via a buffet but with people operating griddles to prepare fresh egg etc dishes. I thought this was a bit of a come-down from the last time I was there where things were brought from the kitchen. Breakfast this time maybe 8/10 vs 10/10 before.    Service as before was impeccable and very helpful.    As I mentioned last time you can't get away from the stairs at La Maison Arabe especially if you are in the 'original' part of the Riad; they are moderately steep too. There is a lift in the 'newer' part but still some stairs involved.,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Melbourne, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michael076

My highlight was the country club which can be reached by courtesy shuttle this was pure luxury.

La Maison Arabe,shelly786 wrote a review Sep 2012,50,Amazing deserves to be number one hotel in Marrakech!,I have just returned from a 4 night stay at La Maison Arabe and it was so lovely that it made a four night break feel like a proper holiday. The staff are the nicest I have experienced at a hotel and I have stayed at many around the world. No request is to much and they go out of there way- an example filling in departure forms on our behalf for the airport. The hotel itself is beautiful it is the perfect combination between a riad and a hotel. The rooms(suites) are spacious and have all the modern amenities you could need. Breakfast is around the pool which has a morrocon feel and adds beautifully to the ambience. We did the cookery class which I would say was a must- it was fun informative and very tasty.An added bonus is the additional pool which is 15mins away via complimentary shuttle and is the perfect chill out area after shopping away in the baazars.

La Maison Arabe,Ricki B wrote a review Sep 2012,50,Well Looked After,Our time at La Maison Arabe was superb. The riad was recommended by a friend and we can say that the hotel and staff completely exceeded our expectations; we have never felt more looked after and welcome at a hotel before. Adil and his team of staff were brilliant and as well as catering for our every need in the hotel they provided endless helpful advice and directions for our times outside of the riad which was priceless having found out how chaotic the streets of Marrakesh and in particular the souks can be. Breakfast lunch or dinner was served by the pool which provided a wonderful setting and the bar was a welcome retreat from the heat and hustle and bustle outside.    The Kasbah gardens to which the hotel runs a regular free shuttle bus is the perfect place to spend time under the sun (if it's not too hot) and swimming in the pool whilst enjoying a few fruit cocktails in peace. This along with a Hammam treatment in the hotel's spa make for a thoroughly relaxing time.    The hotel's location is excellent for access to the old part of town by foot or taxi. The newer European area and recommended restaurants were only a short taxi ride away and these were helpfully arranged by the staff at a moment's notice so it was never difficult to get around.    I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Marrakesh for any period of time you will not be disappointed.

La Maison Arabe,Jerry S wrote a review Aug 2012,50,Rhatt in the heart of Morroco,The hotel or Rhatt which is like a Large ventage Hotel or let me say like something out of the  movie Caseblanca with the music playing soft and 1930 style. They have a very confortable  bar area which we used to relax and enjor some concoction made up by a mixologist on flavors which were out of this world.The hotel is located on a back street which could set back the  western traveler somewhat but you enter a Hotel which is 5 star and makes you think of the  bygone year of the past. If you have a suite the rooms our extra large with great pillows  and a large living room  they will work with you on a upgrade if they are available. The Spa  was like going back to the old spas which has total self indulgence and has reasonable prices and if you are with a family will do it coed with total privacy.They have a chef who I would rate one of the best in Morroco who has a cooking class on site  teaching the arts and crafts of being a  Morroccan cook.The overall experience of the hotel is excellent I would recomment going to  the Hotel La Maison Arabe over any of the Western Hotels in the area.This is what is what like  many years ago with a updated version which will make your experience very memmorable and make you fell that you want to go back and relieve the past. On a final note which is not on the quides of Morroco they have a staple for riding horses which is only about 20 minutes away from the hotel which is something if you enjoy that --do it priced right also.

We were invited to the Piano Bar for pre-dinner cocktails and were give a brief history of the property. Over cocktail we were given time to look over the menu and wine list and or order was taken in advance of us being brought to our table. The Piano Bar has a VERY 'cool' feel and history oozes from every pore in the room.    We were brough to our table and had our mind blown by the Poolside location - simply FANTASTIC! Despite being a little bit pricy the food was very nice and the service was very attentive. Two musicians played traditional music through the night which really added to the athmosphere.

What absolutely saved the trip for us was the country pool that belongs to the hotel. There is a free shuttle service provided by the hotel to get out there (around 15 minutes more or less). Our mouths just dropped the first afternoon we went out there. The pool and gardens around it are gorgeous and the lunches served out there were delicious. It was the perfect place for rest and relaxation I don’t know how we could have survived the heat otherwise. At the hotel our large suite was thankfully air conditioned from the moment we stepped in. The hotel staff went out of their way at every moment to make sure we had a great time.

The Riad is a small ( 26 bedroom) and very personal place to stay. Each member of staff engages and really seeks to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. You feel their interest without it being intrusive. They organised some really good guides for us to tour the city and go out into the mountains. The cuisine is very good. Our room was spacious and overlooked the pool so it was quiet ( but then the location of the hotel is in a quiet side street but very accessible for touring the Medina). We took advantage of the country club facility which is accessible via shuttle ( 15 mins) where there is a lovely swimming pool small restuarant and small spa.It is a quiet hotel and ideally suited to couples or families that are seeking comfort and personal space in a location that is central and where you feel really part of the local culture.

Three generations of my family went to this little paradise for 7 days  When we arrived the taxi stopped outside an alley (authentic Morocco) and the kids looked at me as if OMG where have you brought us and I must admit I was worried too. But as soon as we walked into reception everyone was beaming with excitement. And through our stay we could see new people arriing going through the same rollercoasster and it was wonderful to see the joy on their faces as they were given their tour of the hotel.  The hotel was perfect in every way and everyone should at least once in their life experience such a holiday. But having said the building is perfect this is by no means its greatest asset the team are. I have stayed at many 5* hotels in the world but by far this was the best team and service. In many countries I have experienced outstanding hotel service by staff who look like they are too scared to mess up but in the Maison Arabe the staff give and outstanding service because they want to and love their jobs and customers and it has made a huge difference to our holiday. My only problem now is where can i next take my family thats as good or better I dont think there is such a place and will probably end up going back :-)  Oh by the way the food is great and fairly priced the spa treatments are a dream leave the hotel to arrange your day trips because they only seem to associate with quality and value for money and if you can afford it get a Suite you wont regret it.  thank you to mr fabritso and more importantly the La Maison Team keep up the good work and hope to see you again very soon.

When we arrived at our destination at the end of a narrow deserted alley we had no idea what we were in for. As we stepped through the doors of the riad we were blown away. If you are looking for an authentic place to stay with the essence of Morocco all around you then this place is for you. We were upgraded to a room with a large private terrace where we were served breakfast every morning. We enjoyed every morning in our bathrobes over fresh coffee fruits and crepes and so much more. Since we were on the go all day-every day this morning ritual was the perfect start to our day's adventures. The entire staff worked what seemed like 24 hours to ensure that our every need was met and that our stay was all that we planned. They scheduled tour guides and drivers and made all reservations for our dining requests. We also spent an afternoon at the riad's hammam; enjoying an afternoon of excellent treatments.

La Maison Arabe,sfhappycamper wrote a review Jul 2012,50,Cooking School is Wonderful!,We did not stay at the hotel but we loved the cooking class that we took there! The style is participative so everyone has a station with all of the ingredients in front of them along with a TV showing what the head cook is demonstrating and mirrors so you can see her as well. Our class was just the 3 of us--a mom and two teenagers--so we would just gather around to see what the chef was demonstrating. Then you would cook your own lunch and eat it around the pool or in the restaurant. We did an aubergine salad with a tomato rose a courgette salad chicken tagine and a pastry dessert. We also made moroccan bread. The whole meal was delicious and not difficult. We will definitely be doing this at home. They took us to visit a spice store and a bakery with a wood oven that was incredible. We had such a fun time! The two women who ran the class were extremely friendly and fun to spend time with.

La Maison Arabe was recommended to me and it certainly did not disappoint.  The two ladies that ran the class were both professional and fun. The kitchen was immaculately clean and very well organized we even had our own tv screen focused on the chefs cooking area so that as we were cooking you had direct vision onto what she was doing. Very impressive.  We made moroccan bread chicken tangine and two salads which were consumed at the end of the class. All our questions were answered and the staff were not only helpful but entertaining. We also had a lesson on spices used in moroccan cooking which involved looking at the whole spice and then seeing and smelling the ground spice. It was a sensory delight.  But the best thing about this class was that is was full of practical advise and I left there knowing that I could certainly replicate the recipes made that day at home.

The rooms are exquisitely decorated and I left there feeling wonderfully rejuvenated. I also spent an afternoon at the cooking school this was wonderful fun and I ate everything that I cooked at the end a nice little touch was that they gave us a taggeine to take home so that we could make the dish again. The pool was lovely and refreshing there is a 2nd pool at their Country Club which is 15 mins away by complimentary bus. Again this place is of the same standard as the main Riad the pool is larger and there are plenty of sun loungers umbrellas and hats to be found and the gardens are full of herbs and lovely plants. Again the staff were lovely serving a variety of Brochettes salad fruit and drinks. All of the food served in both locations was of a good standard and enough variety so that all tastes were catered for. Before my evening meal I sat sipping the lovely house cocktail in the Jazz bar as a pianist tinkered with the ivories. There was nothing that I could fault and would highly recommend a stay in this little piece of Paradise,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled solo,guernsey,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eyeseyesbaby
La Maison Arabe,SimplyErica wrote a review Jul 2012,50,Helpfullness of Staff,"I must admit that we were not staying at this hotel although very tempted. We were shown two rooms so that we could consider staying on our return trip. We found the waiters reception staff very gentle professional polite and very attentive. We have no hesitation in recommending this hotel based on our experience of dining there on 4 evenings and them also letting us know about the little gem below.    The Reception staff also let us know about a trip we could pay for by joining other hotel guests being taken by airconditioned shuttle bus to exquisite private gardens for the day on the hour. It only took 15 minutes to get there and you arrived at private gardens with ponds olive trees fig trees grapefruit trees pommegranate trees all shade and peace. There is a private residence in the grounds but you can venture onto the beautiful ground floor. There is also a Hamman for treatments beside the pool. As soon as we arrived we were greated by a gentleman called Mohammed who said he was there to serve us and so he did all day. He told us to choose our sunloungers and also a private covered area with huge cushions and bigger than King size bed to laze on when it became a time for some rest. Included in this was a three course lunch which we did not even know about till we wanted to know what we could have for a snack. We received a complimentary non alcholic cocktail on arrival and were were also brought water in ice bucket during the day when we asked for refreshment. The pool was lovely as is had been 47-50 when we were there so we spent two days in this gem that we called ""Heaven on Earth"". The lunch was wonderful and varied choices. The care and attention to the salads BBQ meats and desserts was lovely. We were of course shaded during the lunch hour so very comfortable. In the afternoon Mohammed came around offering everyone a lovely cold flannel lemon scented to cool ourselves which was much appreciated. There were lovely clean changing rooms showers and toilets and also toiletries supplied. We did not need to bring anything as everything supplied even down to hats by the pool if you did not have one. We spent a most wonderful time in this magical place and could not have been treated better by the staff. Will definitely return when we next come back to Marrakech.",Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SimplyErica
La Maison Arabe,Patrizia P wrote a review Jul 2012,50,special place,La maison Arabe is a wonderful place. We went there for the Hammam and as soon as we entered the hotel we were welcomed by the kind and attentive staff. We were offered a fresh orange juice by the pool such a beautiful and peaceful place to recover from the souk's madness.  The hammam experience was special. The staff was caring and nice. The place was incredible. They explained in detail how the treatment would be then they led us to the changing room were we were given bath robes and slippers. Then we were taken to the hammam a private room just for the two of us so intimate with the soft lights. The treatments began with black soap. We relaxed for a while then there was the scrub phase with the kassa. Then the mask. We were so surprised that the heat was actually so good. After some time shampoo and shower. We were then taken to the relaxing area. It was so wonderful that we would have liked to stay there forever. Hundreds of candles were burning and in the centre of the room there was a traditional moroccan chandelier that produced a dim and intimate light. Under the chandelier there was a small pool with water that gave a feeling of quietness to the place. As we were lying on the comfortable deck chairs we were brought a good tisane.  The treatment was so amazing that it made us feel good for the rest of the day (not easy at 47°C). We would highly recommend this experience to every traveller.,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Colico, Italy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/224PatriziaP224
La Maison Arabe,sild-o wrote a review Jul 2012,50,Beautiful Riad in the heart of the Medina,We spent 3 days at the Maison Arabe in July during Ramadan. Every aspect of our stay was perfect and it was everything we were hoping to find in Morocco.  The Riad is beautifully decorated. It is sophisticated but at the same time it is a relaxing comfortable Moroccan style atmosphere. There are several rooms inside and outside where one can relax or drink the complimentary afternoon tea.  The location is perfect; close enough to the main square but yet in a quiet remote street. The rooms are large and very well insulated. We could not hear people in the pool area (our room was just above it) nor could we hear the calling for prayer although we were quite close to the minaret.  The Riad was spotless and the room was well furnished and equipped. Although we did no watch TV we had 2 flat screens in the room.  As I mentioned above there is a pool in the the Riad. Actually Maison Arabe has another larger pool located about 15mn away. This annex also serves lite bites. A shuttle can take you there every hour. It is located in a beautiful private shaded garden.  The service was remarkable. All the people working there from the front desk to the waiters to housecleaning all were very hospitable and personable and made sure we had everything we needed.  Breakfast was included in our package. The food was varied plentiful and suitable for all tastes; Selections of juices breads and pastries eggs meat and cheese traditional Moroccan soups as well as fresh fruits.  This was our first stop in our trip to Morocco and we can’t imagine any place better.,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Minneapolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sild-o
La Maison Arabe,T J wrote a review Jul 2012,50,Wonderful experience,I could start by saying how charming this tucked away hidden gem is. Then I could talk about the great restaurant and wonderful spa. But beyond all that that makes this hotel more than special is the rare and intimate care the staff gives its guest. I truly felt as if this was our maison and the staff was caring only for us. Everything was made easy. Adeli was wonderful and extremely helpful not only giving us excellent dinner suggestion but advising us on directions. There were some draw back. We stayed at the penthouse suite and the stairs were extremely steep. But the intimate terrace and the wonderfully decorated spacious room made returning even with the stairs worth it. To give you an example of the unique service I had an upset stomach for a brief part of the trip and without asking they bought a cool towel with rose water and put the compress on my head and brought a pot of mint tea --- I wasn't even that sick! Now tell me if you think La Mamounia do that! Overall a wonderful experience. I would be remiss not to mention the wonderful bar and bartender that was always ready with a special cocktail and warm smile. By the way he was the one that brought the rose water and mint tea.,Date of stay: July 2012,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TJ298

From the moment we walked in and were welcomed at the reception desk by the charming Mourad our stay was faultless. The attention to detail is impeccable and the service exceptional. We attended the cooking course and the Dada and Wafa and the entire group made our course an experience to remember .  There are 2 pools one at the Riad and the other country club. We spent an afternoon at the country club - transport is by shuttle service and is arranged by the hotel. Nothing is too much effort for the fantastic staff.  The room we had was very comfortable and well equipped.

La Maison Arabe,Jessie Benchrifa wrote a review Jul 2012,50,My favourite Hammam in Marrakech......,I have visited La Maison 3 times now....... Its my favourite place!  Been meaning to write a review since my first visit in March on my birthday but everytime I go it gets better and better! So now is the time!  I have been to Marrakech many times this year but only on my long stays I make the time to go and Im always happy I did the women that work there are truly amazing x  They always remember me make sure I am looked after and as a frequent visitor there is still a formal professionalism that I appreciate even though not necessary. The Manager whos name I can never remember is a kind sweet welcoming woman nothing is ever too much trouble.  I always have the same girl for the hammam shes only tiny but she can make my skin glow like Ive been reborn (so not an exaggeration!) I feel brand new after 30 minutes with her!  Last time I visited I brought my mum She always moaned about the price of the package (£55 appx sterling) but after 2 hours she admitted that when I say its worth every penny I meant it! This is a 5 star Spa/Hammam. Everything is luxurious peaceful and serene. The masseurs who work there are also lovely. They are very good at what they do never in my life have I ever fell asleep during massage until now! Magic Hands! The women (its women ran) speak a little english so its easy to communicate. They also let couples go into together in the hammam (traditionally you cant share a hammah with the opposite sex). Its a romantic place.  I highly recommend this place to everyone!  I just hope its open in August as its ramadan!,Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Rainham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessinEssex25

La Maison Arabe,Lana H wrote a review Jul 2012,50,La Maison Arabe,My boyfriend and I just came back from our holiday in Marrakech; we stayed 4 nights at La Maison Arabe which is just EXCELLENT. It truly is a small oasis amongst hustle and bustle of the medina and certainly deserves its award by Tripadvisor. The décor is very stylish with great attention to detail and feels very warm and welcoming. The riad was very clean and overall looked immaculate.    We stayed in the patio room called Sabah it was very spacious and had a large stone dome above our bed with a Moroccan lantern hanging from it which felt really unique.    The breakfast was good overall especially their Moroccan crepes which are being prepared in front of you. It was absolutely delicious.    The staff was amazing very friendly attentive and could not do more to help. They arranged a private car transfer for us to and from the airport which I would highly recommend as it saves a lot of hassle. They also can arrange a private 4x4 car for a number of excursions. However we opted for a local company called Morrocan Views for our trip to Atlas Mountains purely because we preferred to have a company of other travelers and they offered a few extras that we liked.    There are two swimming pools one at the riad and the second one is at their country club. They have a private transfer to their country club that leaves every hour from 10.30am with the last return to the hotel at 7pm. The club is about 15 minutes away and is a great escape from the busy Marrakesh. They serve lunch drinks and have a massage room so you could easily spend an entire day there if you like. The only pity is that both swimming pools close in the evening but I guess they need time to maintain it.    Overall it is a great 5 start riad with great location and good facilities. It offers everything you need to make your stay relaxing and enjoyable. I certainly would stay there again and again.,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LanaH18

As the previous reviews state it's in an excellent locationless than ten mins to the square & Souks.  The hotel is like Aladdins cavewith lots of small courtyardsrooms and authentic passageways.    The restaurant looks over the pool and is romantic at night with candles all around.  We ate there one nightwe had a Tangines which was very goodalthough a little on the small side compared to the one we ate at AlFassia.we had a beautiful luncha chicken sandwich it had a wonderful taste of spices.    The staff were so friendlypolite & professional we was greeted by a warm smilegood morning/evening every time we saw someone. The hotel arranged out half day walking tourtaxi to Al Fasia rest & was always very helpful with every enquiry we made. Adiel at the front desk was so efficient with our check in and tour of hotel.    Our room was very clean and authenticevery time we went out they came inane made the room up.    Rashid in the jazz bar loves to make cocktails and we can recommend you try them he is an excellent host.    I had a Hamman/massage which was good.    We went to the Mk Maison for dinner and was socked how small and not authentic compared to la maison good meal though.    We also spent. To the day at the country club they own a ten min courtesy bus ride away. It was peaceful with lots of layout beds there are four tents with double beds in to relax we had lunch as well.

Its an interesting concept because there is an attention to service that you find in a small or family-run place (we were treated like royalty from the moment we arrived) and then there are dining and spa options usually available only in a larger hotel. Everything was top-notch here: large and impeccably clean room excellent food at the poolside restaurant. We fell in love with the hotel's Private Gardens which one gets to by a free car service. The temperature got very hot while we were in Marrakech and it was great to escape there and swim all afternoon.

La Maison Arabe,slw986 wrote a review Jun 2012,50,Exceeded All Expectations,we visited La Maison Arabe the end of May. We were attending a conference where most were staying at Four Seasons Sofitel La Mamounia etc. We couldn't have been happier. Hotel atmosphere is like walking into a movie set (the lighting little hidden nooks sounds calmness) not to mention the staff who could not have done more for us. Upon arrival we were shown into a room up flights of stairs. my husband is recovering from knee issue and we were upgraded to elevator part of hotel immediately. Restaurant setting is around a pool with beautiful lighting at night. Quality of food was as good as anywhere we tried out of hotel. And they have a country club with pool restaurant beds to lie around to get away from city. Location is 10 mins from square while many big hotels are simply NOT in the city. We felt safe and could walk anywhere.

La Maison Arabe,DavidandRebeccaG wrote a review Jun 2012,50,The Place To Be In Marrakesh,There are two places to stay in Marrakesh for the traveler looking for a superior experience. The first is of course La Mamounia which is the ultimate in the big hotel experience. For those looking for smaller more intimate and charming place there is only La Maison Arabe.    Unlike the Relais & Chateux property in Marrakesh Mason L'Orange (which I also visited) La Maison Arabe perfectly blends the riad experience with that of a luxury hotel. There are three reasons for this. First unlike many of the newer boutique riads La Maison Arabe is not just one central courtyard that makes you feel a bit locked-in. Rather its a bit of a rambling property made up of six separate but connected riads. Second the hotel's nearby garden/swimming pool which is a 15 minute (free) van ride away has more charm than the Majorelle Gardens. The pool and food service at the pool are exquisite. It's a true luxury experience. To my taste I prefer this pool to that of La Mamounia. The third reason is the in-hotel hammam/spa. It was truly exceptional in terms of ambiance amenities and service.    My wife and I visited here on our honeymoon. We spent 4 days and had plenty to do. We participated in a class in the cooking school and made our own chicken tagine (so much fun -- and delicious). We had our first Moroccan dinner in the hotel restaurant which has a well-deserved reputation for excellence. It was a memorable meal. The hotel jazz bar with its barman who knows everyone is a great place to start or end your evening.    The staff is both discrete and helpful. The front desk staff Adil in particular makes you feel welcome from the moment you walk in the door. They arrange local transport excellent city guides and outside dinner reservations that were always spot-on. Many others on this site have written about the wonderful decor of the hotel. I will add that it is both mischevious and endlessly surprising with more and more beautiful objects set about and one jewel-like room after another waiting to be explored. At night the hotel glows with candle and lamplight.    The rooms are great. They are spacious and the bathrooms have completely modern and luxurious fixtures and finishes. Overall our experience in Marrakesh was enormously enriched by our opportunity to stay at this great property.

La Maison Arabe,DAVEBUCK wrote a review Jun 2012,50,A hidden Gem. But not your ordinary Hotel,I love this place. But it is not for the ordinary traveller. I love boutique hotels. Those off the main streets where you get a true flavor of the area. It is a Riad so it is an old palace in an alley. There are so many little rooms that i am still trying to figure out where everything is. The rooms are spacious with A/C Wi Fi and TV. The beds are comfortable and the staff is very warm and friendly. However this is not for the ritz Carleton or the Marriott crowd. Our room was a 3 floor walkup. The style is a little worn but I would definitely come back again. There is a Hamman which shouldn't be missed.

La Maison Arabe,mekvn wrote a review May 2012,50,"Highly recommended, perfect service",Excellent highly trained and friendly staff very helpful and polite. We enjoyed perfect service from everyone - starting from the bell-boy and to the guys on the reception. Restaurants serve delicious food however it should be noted that the “European” restaurant serves food prepared Moroccan style;) to be honest we didn’t see much difference between the European and Moroccan restaurants. The breakfast is ok could use some more variety the SPA is good.  The rooms could use slippers (we never received ours) and on-site they have only one swimming pool - an outdoor pool in close proximity to the restaurant (the eating guests sit close to it) so we saw no one during our stay using it. The indoor pool is a 15-minute trip on a shuttle bus (at least we were told so didn’t go there).    Классный отель в морроканском стиле.

He organised everything including the accommodation at La Masion Arabe my expectations weren't high. On my arrival he decision made me a happy possum. The rooms are generous clean and tastefully decorated ( for it's location ) The facilities ae very good and the staff are polite courteous and helpful.

La Maison Arabe,Bumble2012 wrote a review May 2012,50,Exceptional Staff,On a recent trip to Marrakech my daughter and I visited La Maison Arabe for dinner we were greeted by a friendly receptionist who was most accommodating as we didn't have a reservation and they were busy. We were seated next to the pool - enjoyed cocktails (try the Singapore Sling)! Then due to a full restaurant they set a table for us by the pool again where we enjoyed traditional Moroccan cuisine. Can't comment on the rooms as only there for dinner but if they match the experience we had - then well worth a visit to a beautiful property.,Date of stay: May 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,Leicestershire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bumble2012

The set up is awesome proper work stations with TV screens showing the lady demonstrating. We got a tour of a local bakery and a short lesson on the history of the city and it's spices. The staff a quite funny too which helps when you start concentrating too hard on chopping veg!  We made a tagine and two salads then got to eat it all.

La Maison Arabe,Mark R wrote a review May 2012,50,My thoughts are on La Maison Arabe-Honeymoon,We set off to La Maison Arabe on 11th May 2012 . We were greeted by very friendly staff who were attentive and very respectful. We were shown to our room through a beautiful courtyard where the room was spacious clean and more improtantly had air-con as it was 40 degrees plus through the day. Breakfasts were wonderful and again the staff were attentive ensuring that we were informed of the variety of foods available. If this is your first time (like ours) please ask the reception for detail of what to see in Marrkech as you will receive a detailed description of what to do and see. We were given a map with points jotted on of recommendations - We had two evening meals in the hotel and found them very good value and enjoyed the live music which added to the Morrocan experience. The Jazz bar is a good way to cool down and the tapas was perfect for an evening light bite. The country club which is a little away from the hotel ( free chauffeuer) is an ideal place to swim and relax away from the hustle and bustle of the Souk's. The staff and hotel senior manger would be a credit to any hotel and made our honeymoon very special. Over all a beautiful hotel and a wonderful honeymoon.,Date of stay: May 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Wrexham, Wales, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/568MarkR568
La Maison Arabe,Chris Z wrote a review May 2012,50,"luxury hotel, Highly recommended.",I first went to Marrakesh back in the 70's when I was a student hitchhiking around Europe with a knapsack. Fast forward to winter 2011/2012 and I found myself there albeit in somewhat different circumstances - a little bit older wiser and wealthier. This time I invited my daughter and her new husband to join me and we had great experiences. Morocco is as wonderful as I remember it - full of charm beauty and first class hospitality. Our hotel a privately owned Riad in the center of the old city souk was La Maison Arabe. What a great place. They took care of everything making sure that we were comfortable and safe. The finest linens and furnishings in the rooms (I had a suite Hilal and my daughter and husband had Noor) and two wonderful restaurants - one by the pool (Trois Saveurs) serving international cuisine and the other a traditional Moroccan restaurant in the most beautiful setting.

La Maison Arabe,AmericanMacaroon wrote a review May 2012,50,Wonderful and Amazing Place to Stay in Marakech,We have just spent the last week at La Masion Arabe and had the best experience at a hotel ….ever. We had researched many hotels in the area and had chosen Masion Arabe due to the good reviews and especially the outstanding reviews about the staff – and even then they beat all our expectations.    We spend our lives travelling for business and have stayed all over America and Europe and have never had the outstanding service that this hotel provides. The hotel is stunning; it is an old Riad that has been beautifully restored with hidden courtyards a mystical pool and beautiful restaurants and cozy nooks all around the hotel. Our suite was amazing – we stayed in the Aladdin suite which was lovely with a private terrace looking over the pool (although we also peeked in a regular room which was also beautiful).    What really makes the difference at this hotel are the wonderful and kind staff. The Moroccan hospitality shines through and the staff really care about your needs. Everyone is extremely friendly and they do almost anything to make sure you are happy including making food that is not on the menu setting up a special table for dinner letting us stay in our suite until very late on day of check out and managing to prepare sandwiches and food for our plane ride back 30 minutes before we were leaving (thank you Adil ) and many other requests that I am sure other hotels would not always accommodate.    The hotel also has a “country club” location about 10 mins drive away which simply put…is paradise!! It is a house that is even older than the hotel with a wonderful large pool and beautiful gardens filled with olive trees herbs flowers and ponds. There are huge cabanas (with giant beds) next to the pool which are covered – which are fantastic for taking a peaceful nap after lunch. Also the lunches they cook at the country club location are out of this world. They have a shuttle that takes you to and from the location every hour.    The Spa is wonderful and the Spa Manager and staff are another outstanding aspect of the hotel that will keep us coming back. We had several treatments but the one you cannot miss is the Royal treatment – which includes being scrubbed and massaged and cleaned in the Hamamm (steam room) – a private one (you can be by yourself or with your partner) and then you have a massage afterwards which are among the best massages we have ever had. If you do go to the hotel do not miss out on this experience.    The food at the hotel is excellent. My husband was originally born in Morocco and we are very used to eating Moroccan food prepared by his family. We were both very happy to find that the food was both authentic and delicious. Also the restaurants (both the traditional Moroccan and the three flavors restaurant) ambiance were incredible.    If you are visiting Marrakech for a truly memorable and exceptional experience you cannot go wrong staying at La Masion Arabe. We highly recommend this for anyone – couples people with children solo travelers or groups.

La Maison Arabe,RenZhe wrote a review May 2012,50,Charming little gem in Marrakech,It is amazing that this little boutique hotel with 26 roomd has 2 restaurants 1 jazz lounge 1 tea salon and 1 spa. Every space in this hotel is tastefully furnished with Moroccan flavour. They just have good eyes for beautiful and charming details.    The room (Nassim) we stayed has a little shared courtyard which opens to the sky above. There is a semi private patio where you can sit in the evening and gaze the stars. It is very quiet and us such a relieving contrast with the mess out in the town.    A hallmark of this little hotel is the exemplary demonstration of the Moroccan hospitality. Almost everyone here including the housekeepers are friendly and caring. Special mention goes to Hicham of the front desk and Rachid the head bartender. Their service has been sincere and caring and non-intrusive.    They have a little gift shop around the street corner that sells unique Moroccan wares with reasonable prices.    The only area which we think needs improvement is the beds and pillows. Somehow we found the beds too hard and the pillows too soft. There were no extra pillows stocked in the room. We did not ask for them as the ones we had were still sleepable.,Date of stay: May 2012,,"Singapore, Singapore",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RenZhe

We would go back and forth between both establishments and all I can say is thatafter comparing we are thrilled and relieved we chose to stay here. There is a personalized service at La Maison Arabe that I believe is just impossible at a large hotel. After the first day the breakfast staff remembered how we like our coffee. After the first day many people working at La Maison Arabe were addressing us by name and the barman would know immediately what to serve me and remembered exactly how Ilike my martini. There was always the sense that everyone was going the extra mile to ensure we had a perfect stay. And it seemed everyone spoke English which was so unexpectedsome better than others of course but one day I was even able to exchange a few words with the cleaning women! The hoteland our room were so beautiful and tastefully decorated but itreally was the staff at La Maison Arabe that made our few days here so special.

We had both a suite and a double room in different parts of the hotel. Both accomodations were very good and the breakfast was delicous freshly made to order. The most amazing and breathtaking part of the experience though was the multitude and elegance of all the common areas. You could sit down for a talk or to do some reading in a wast variety of different places alltrough the hotel. There were garden areas secluded sitting room areas patios and in addition an elegant and inviting Jazzbar.  The Hotel is situated only a 5-10 min walk from the Medina.  We did a lot of sightseeing in the morning and every afternoon we took the complementary shuttlebus to the lovely hotel country club area where we relaxed and swam in the large pool.

The attention to deatils the ambiance especially at night and the staff ALL combine to make this a perfect choice for lodging. The morning we were to check out we noticed that one of our main duffle style luggage pieces had a seam that was giving way and would probably not survive the trip home. The front desk said we will repair it no problem. And within 30 minutes it was done. Once home I had it looked at by a luggage repair professional and he said that there was nothing more he could do. The repair done in Morocco was perfect. The 2 restaurants and the jazz bar are wonderful places to relaxe and dine and the area around the pool is beautiful as well.

La Maison Arabe,SwindonRobin wrote a review Apr 2012,50,Exceeded all expectations,What a lovely experience! The staff could not do enough for us so friendly and obliging - nothing too much trouble. The surroundings are traditionally Morrocan and very comfortable. One restaurant has an open patio surrounding a swimming pool perfect for breakfast lunch aternoon tea (provided free) and dinner; while the Moroccan restaurant provides a more formal traditional setting. The food in both is exquisite. Within walking distance of the Koutoubia mosque and main square it is in an ideal position. The free shuttle to their country club gives the opportunity to relax by a large swimming pool have lunch or drinks again with superb service. Did not use the spa but it looked lovely. On our last day we were not leaving until 15:40h and on leaving breakfast we were met and given the key to another roon which was at our disposal for the rest of the day.

The amenities are consistent with any 5-star hotel. However it was the service that ""got me at 'Hello'"". No question or request was considered too trivial; every staff member (in particular the concierges) were extremely attentive courteous and friendly.

The breakfast by the pool among the best we know; dinner at the morocan restaurant the best meal we have had in Morocco. Drinks at the jazz bar just perfect with the complicity of Rachid mixing non-alcohol cocktails for the childs. The heated pool is great after a hard time shopping at the souks and the garden with the big pool after a short way by private transfer is just beautiful and truly relaxing.

Walking through the door of this centrally located riad transports you instantly into a dream from the Arabian Nights. The decor is magical and wonderfully evocative of past times. The ambiance is restful. The staff are exceptional from the reception desk onwards to every department in the hotel. My wife and I have just spent 7 nights there. Marrakech is quite a culture shock (in an enjoyable way!) and La Maison Arabe is an oasis in the madness of the city. Our room was excellent. The restaurant is welcoming and offers a good range of dishes. My wife had two treatments in the Hammam and loved it. We both took part in a cookery class and learned a great deal and then ate the proceeds of our efforts. Great fun. The hotel's Country Club (free shuttle to get there) is a little gem. The hotel organised an english speaking driver to take us up into the lower Atlas Mountains for a day. Well worth doing. This English couple highly recommend La Maison Arabe.

It took forever to decide and since we were arriving by rental car finally chose La Maison Arabe as they provide free parking. What an amazing place! All the mystery and coziness we were expecting from a riad plus the chance to be in the center of things – the medina is just crazy and bursting with energy – you really should be  in the medina especially if like us it’s your first trip. But the big plus for us was the country property and swimming pool in the Palm Grove owned by La Maison Arabe which only hotel guests can use. They provide a minivan transfer several times a day and took around 15 minutes to get there. Pure rest and relaxation! And we practically had the whole place to ourselves just magical. The hotel doesn’t have rooms out there (too bad!) but it’s a great place to spend a few hours. We ate 2 evening at the poolside restaurant at the hotel great food and service.

The hotel is down a simple street and I could not imagine from the unnoticeable and plain exterior walls what lay behind the front doors. Everything in the hotel from my room (a suite called “Nar” with a private terrace overlooking the swimming pool) to the salons to the restaurants to the gorgeous bar is elegant in an understated way. The hotel is a bit difficult to navigate at first with lots of intimate salons but that led me to discover something new every day. I fell in love with the lanterns in front of the restaurant so much so that I ended up buying a smaller version to take home. You should know before coming that Marrakech is a shopper’s paradise! I am definitely returning next year this time with a near-empty suitcase that I will fill up with purchases and will certainly be staying again at this exquisite hotel which in terms of decoration and service is up there with the best I have stayed in worldwide.,Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Melbourne, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RachelH291

La Maison Arabe,100RAH wrote a review Mar 2012,50,The only place to stay in Marrakech if you value peace and tranquility.,"""Mind body and soul"" they say but here you can heal them all.    I brought my daughter to this outstanding Riad for a convalescing holiday - strange choice to go to the bustling city of Marrakech some might think but.....La Maison Arabe has simply got it right. They understand how to provide an oasis of peace in an otherwise sometimes harsh and often too meaningless world.    I think this must be the only hotel with a quiet and truly beautiful country club a mere 20mins away by complimentary transport. Ideal if you want to experience a taste of Arabia without the frenetic pace of the Medina.    The food was way beyond the standard tourist trail 'best of Marrakech' and the staff could not have been more polite friendly and constantly went 'beyond the call of duty' demonstrating impeccable training. They made us feel a real part of the family.    The Hammam is an absolute must and has unquestionably to be the best we have ever been to.

La Maison Arabe,g12doc wrote a review Mar 2012,40,Great hotel within walking distance of the souks,"The first impression as you are taken down the small alley that leads down to the hotel made us wonder what sort of htel we could expect to find in such a confined space. But once inside it became obvious that the 26 bedroom hotel was very spacious indeed. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful whenever needed.    The two restaurants one serving Moroccan cuisine and the other a la carte and by the pool were very good. The only criticism we could level would be that the menu did not change throughout the week and since we ate in every night we started to run out of new things to try. Additionally we had forgotten how nice it has been to eat out in the UK since the smoking ban came into force. The mainly French residents seemed incapable of doing without a cigarette for more than a few minutes at a time which was a shame.    We experienced 3 of the bedrooms which were all different in their own way - partly a reflection of the non-uniform nature of the building. If you are thinking of a hotel with cardboard cutout rooms then think again. The common denominator however was the slightly less than perfect sound proofing in the rooms in the evening. In the old part of the hotel our room overlooked the inner courtyard and as most activity was centred around the pool this was very acceptable bt in the rooms overlooking the pool you will get some noise from the restaurant and the musicians but this stops at 11pm. If you definitely don't want any noise probably best to ask for a room with a lower number (teens and 20's) as they are away from the pool.    The country club was very good indeed with attentive service good food and remarkably few people visiting. On one beautiful day we were the only people there for a few hours. Perfect....    The Medina / souks are about 5-10 minutes walk away. Just watch out for the scams. On our first day and while trying to orientate ourselves on the map a young man asked us where we wanted to go and when we showed hi indicated that we were a long way from our destination. Unfortunately (for him) he chose to point to a place on the map tghat was about 100 yards from where we had started out and even I am not that bad at rfeaduing a map. Moving on anoter man came up to us a few minutes later asked us the same question and this time added ""Which hotel are you staying at?"" Realising that this was a scamwe told him and he again told us we were a long way from our destination. Finally 5 minuites later another older man told us he was from our hotel and could show us where we wanted to go. Unfortunately he would not tell us the name of the road we thanksed him and left. Gentle scamming unlike Egypt.    The hotel was a pleasure to stay at and very restful.

La Maison Arabe,Gretchen B wrote a review Mar 2012,50,A Must Visit,We just returned from a week-long trip to Marrakesh and can't say enough wonderful things about Maison Arabe. Contrary to many of the guidebooks we found that staying in the Medina with a young child (1 year-old) was quite enjoyable and the folks at Maison Arabe had a lot to do with this. The staff were incredibly welcoming -- to both us and our daughter -- and went out of their way to make our stay fabulous. (Our daughter has food allergies and they even had special treats on hand for her when we arrived!) The food was delicious -- we found the restaurants in the riad to be some of the best food we had -- and the rooms were incredibly comfortable. We took the cooking class and loved it and also enjoyed the hamam (spa/massage). We cannot say enough about what a wonderful place Maison Arabe was to stay and particularly how delightful the staff were. In general we found Marrakesh very welcoming to children and we had a wonderful trip.,Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Boston, Massachusetts",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GB249

La Maison Arabe,Christie I wrote a review Mar 2012,50,The Best Place To Experience Marrakech,La Maison Arabe was the highlight of my recent trip to Marrakech. When we first arrived I wasn't sure what to expect as I walked through the double door entrance into a mostly undescriptive building but inside awaited the most beautiful riad in Marrakesh. The rugs furniture and paintings that decorated the walls made me feel as if I had just walked into the finest home in Marrakesh. Their style was a blend of traditional Moroccan decor with a modern twist. Walking through the corridors that are nothing like your average hotel's boring hallways I explored the many courtyards tea room jazz bar pool terrace spa and cooking area- it was such a thrill! I loved discovering a small fountain with rose pedals in the main courtyard and chairs and tables in my room's courtyard where I could enjoy the complimentary wine.    Rashid the bartender at the bar was fantastic! Not only did he make us some delicious cocktails but when I asked him how he made his mint tea he gave me a thorough explanation and demonstration. I prompty documented every step and can't wait to repeat at home with my new tea set.    I also loved my room which was beautifully decorated with unique works of art. The bathroom was my favorite with its tiled floor and walls. Even the robes and slippers were wonderful.

La Maison Arabe,Mary M wrote a review Mar 2012,50,exquisite oasis,We were in Marrakech for five days last week and were staying at a much more humble riad in the neighborhood of the Maison Arabe. Because I had unexpectedly sprained my ankle and walking was difficult and painful we needed to find somewhere nearby for dinners. Who could have imagined we would stumble upon such a breathtaking oasis as the Maison Arabe. We were instantly treated with absolute friendliness and courtesy and even though we never reserved we had dinner there for the last 3 nights of our trip. We were expertly served with grace elegance and humour by the wonderful Abdellah and his colleagues. The candle-lit poolside setting was magical and the food of course was exquisite. We enjoyed the lovely music of lute and guitar playing discreetly in the background. Though we didn't see any rooms or the bar area or any of the other amenities the Maison has to offer we can only imagine that it must be the dreamiest place to stay in all of Marrakech.

La Maison Arabe,Chris B wrote a review Feb 2012,50,Couldn't have chosen better,We stayed for a week and were expertly looked after. The promised free upgrade happened when they moved us from a lovely room into an even more beautiful suite. Inside the hotel is gorgeous to look at and scrupulously clean. Its levels of service included letting us know the Manchester United scores. (We are sure they would do the same for City fans.) The location within the city is excellent: we could easily walk out to all the major sites and restaurants. A very real bonus was the complementary trip out to the riad's private casbah with its gardens and large pool. Here the club sandwiches are extraordinarily good with fresh herb salads from the garden. We ate in the restaurant twice and its food is good and not that expensive. The only downside and this is true of any hotel within the old city is being woken by calls from the local mosque but breakfast is served until 11am so you can just go back to sleep.,Date of stay: February 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"York, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/851ChrisB

It's located down an alley which adds to the serenity of the place. I was keen to have a look at the restaurant menu and perhaps look into booking a treatment and I obtained a price list after asking the surly receptionist. I was then asked by one of the guys on reception whether I had a booking for the restaurant to which I replied I hadn't but I was interested in looking at the menu/prices with a view to eat there. They then walked me to the door and held it open for me which suggested they wanted me to leave and did not seem to want to answer my question. Maybe I didn't fit their client spec however I found this incredibly rude. I would have quite happily booked a table if they had offered me the opportunity but I was made to feel I wasn't worthy of their attention. It is an amazing looking place but customer service is sorely lacking.

La Maison Arabe,FarmersKent wrote a review Feb 2012,50,An Extremely Romantic Valentine's Weekend,Who would believe that up a fairly scruffy ally way in the middle of a scruffy town we would find such a luxurious oasis behind the door we entered - the Maison Arabe. This French run hotel has quality tasteful decor and naturally beautiful architecture. It is so picturesque and romantic. The staff even lit an open fire in our wonderful room which overlooked a courtyard with a small swimming pool (that looked more like an ornamental pond) bar and tables to eat. In the evenings the whole place was candle lit. The service was second to none. Nothing was too much trouble. We were given excellent advice on where to go and what to see maps and shown to a taxi. We tried eating at Pepe Nero which has better reviews than the Maison Arabe but thought the food service and general prettiness of the setting was preferable where we were. The bathroom and fittings are of the highest quality as are the sheets robes towels etc. Very five star. Their Haman is the prettiest I have seen. Ornamental pool rose petals candles beautiful mosaics and no sense of rush at all. The cooking school was very well organised in a specially designed room all pupils with their own station some are not like this. We not only learnt about cooking but also the customs history and different styles of cuisine of Morocco. Mohamed who talked us through what the cook was doing was very knowledgeable and happy to answer questions on all matters Moroccan apart as well as foodie questions. They serve European food too so the choice is yours. There is an exquisite bar in the style of Paris during the 1940’s. The jazz pianist was second to none. On Saturday night there were a duo playing in the restaurant. One on a guitar and one on a lute it was the most beautiful sound sort of Spanish twelve string meets Indian. We went out to the Mamounia and the Royal Mansour but could not wait to return to the cosiness of the Maison Arabe. Churchill himself used to eat there in the early days so it has a long history of excellence. What this Riad has which no others seem to is a country club 15 mins by hotel shuttle bus outside the town. The pool there is beautiful though unheated so not warm enough for our trip. The gardens there in my mind are a great deal better than the gardens at the Villa Mayorelle which were all cacti. The country club is a very pretty setting indeed and well worth the visit. Why this place is not higher on Trip Advisor ranking we do not know. To have that oasis on a hot day in Marrakech would be wonderful. The weather was cold when we visited the weekend of 12th February but this was unusual as it was in the UK that day -10 degrees. We sunbathed at lunchtime on a secluded sundeck at the Maison Arabe and they brought our lunch up there.,Date of stay: February 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Edenbridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FarmersKent
La Maison Arabe,Simon N wrote a review Feb 2012,50,Truly Exceptional Experience,We have just returned from 3 nights at La Maison Arabe and having been lucky enough to stay at a number of top class hotels in our time this one is very much at the top of the list. I guess others will say it but it really is the staff that make the difference. Unerringly polite and helpful and always ready to do what they can to make your stay special. More importantly it feels and I am sure is very genuine. A feeling that is not always there at other hotels.    We travelled as a couple and found the standard room to be just right for unwinding in after a few nights in the Atlas mountains. The Hamman/Spa - which I have rated a fitness centre below - lives up to expectations.    I would recommend taking some time to explore all the public rooms of the hotel. It has a number of different courtyards and snug areas to while away the time if the Souks are not (always) your thing and don't feel reserved about using the pool we did and it's a great way to refresh yourself after the sun has gone off the terraces!    This is the sort of hotel where putting a little bit of effort in is rewarded by which I mean talking to the staff and asking for advice on where to go and what to do and do treat it as a home.    And finally - do go to their private Garden.,Date of stay: February 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SimonN538

We are a family of 4 (two sons ages 8 and 10) and LMA was absolutely amazing. Not only was the hotel stunning -- a beautiful (and huge) restored riad on the edge of the medina -- but the quality of the service food and overall experience was incredible. We were in a 3-level ""royal"" suite which was perfect for our family and one of the nicest rooms we've ever been in -- perfectly appointed private and quiet. Even more striking however was the warmth and attention of the staff. In addition to graciously accomodating our last minute request to add 12 (!) people for Christmas Eve dinner (which was an incredible meal) the staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome entertain the children and make sure no need was unmet.

Fantastic few days in this atmospheric hotel - exotic and magical - beautifully furnished in traditional style.    There is a deep culture of excellent service with everyone showing real care for guests. Adil the Guest Relations Manager at front desk was truly excellent.    Location on western side of Medina is quieter although proximate to Mosque with early calls to prayer and the souk/street toward Bab Doukkala without the typical hawkers and feels very local.    Swimming Pool in Country Club a bit cold for use during our visit as unheated but spot was delightful and probably great in warmer months.

Our room looked through large windows and french doors onto a second story courtyard with a fountain and seating area. Beautiful fragrant climbing vines and flowers were everywhere. During breakfast we watched a Moroccan woman seated in a shaft of morning sunlight making the bread for our meal as if we were watching a beautiful film. In the evening the romantic ambience of the bar is luscious. The hotel's Moroccan restaurant is probably the most gorgeous dining room I have experienced and the food was magnificent.

Everyone at the hotel is incredibly polite and attentive without being over the top or intrusive. I had an unfortunate self inflicted injury which left me with only one working leg (recovered now!). The staff couldn't have been more helpful from carrying me to our gorgeous suite (they kindly upgraded us so I could be near the lift) bandaging my foot calling to check on my progress to delivering a set of crutches to my room! They did all of this and more and without me even having to ask. The hotel is beautifully decorated giving you that sense of a world gone by and with candles and roses to meet you at every turn. It gives you the feeling of staying at somebody’s house as it’s so friendly warm and relaxing. That includes the country club which is a natural and peaceful “secret garden” surrounded by olive trees. The food throughout our stay was fantastic. The dessert in the hotel's Moroccan restaurant was the best I've ever eaten. La Maison Arabe is an incredibly special unique haven and they without doubt made our holiday to Marrakech a very memorable one.

La Maison Arabe,James S wrote a review Dec 2011,50,Fantastic New Year's,As I plan this year's New Year's celebration in Hokkaido I recollect last year's in Marrakesh at La Maison Arabe. From the moment we arrived very late and unexpectedly by train thanks to Royal Air Maroc vagaries we were greeted with warmth and openness from Rashid the first rate bar manager who allowed us to decompress in grand style (and hastily procured our excellent food). He was a real beacon of excellent service and fun throughout our stay. Indeed the consistent customer-focus attention gives one the perspective of being a resident of many months. Youssef provided the same level of attention with a kind gentle smile in areas of support with luggage front desk service and local directions. The entire staff is extremely well trained and attentive.

I have stayed at some great and truly memorable properties while on my many business trips. So when on vacation and spending my own hard-earned money I also want to know I am getting something pretty special. I did an extensive amount of research on hotels before going to Marrakech. As my wife and I were traveling with our college-aged son and daughter we wanted to stay near the ""souk action"" but also wanted a place that offered more in terms of luxury and varied activities--a pool and place to enjoy the sunshine for instance. Of course the famous cooking school and the peaceful spa area added icing to the cake. Not disappointed here at La Maison Arabe we found all we had imagined and more.

The decor is in keeping with the best of Moroccan design  There are two restaurants one offering a truly international cuisine & the other a pre-fixe 3 course traditional Moroccan menu. This latter one is expensive but worth every bit. it was the best traditional meal we had there. The restaurant as well is elegantly decored with tables well-spread apart & quiet.  Breakfast is served by the pool. This is the only weak aspect of the hotel. The food was good but the serving staff at breakfast were inattentive & not around when needed.  However the rest of the staff were very professional friendly well-trained and helpful.  Our room was of the same high caliber.

We've just spent 5 nights there and we were continually delighted by the friendly and efficient staff who can't do enough for you.    Our room (a suite in the 'old' side of the hotel) was gorgeous!

La Maison Arabe,Sunscot wrote a review Oct 2011,50,"One of life's ""Finer things""!","My husband and I spent four magical days here at Maison Arabe.  Last year my daughter and I were in Marrakech staying at the very standard Riu Tikida in Palmerie. A hammam and cookery class brought us to Maison Arabe where we ended up spending most of our time (and sadly had to return to the ""prison camp"" at bed time). I vowed then on a return trip to Marrakech it would be to Maison Arabe.  My husband for sure was not to be disappointed!  The elements Maison Arabe has make it so very special.  From the amazingly warm welcome from staff the hospitality of General Manager Toufik (spelling sorry Mr T!) and even the welcoming correspondance from the owner himself Fabrizio Ruspoli. This hotel is led by a superb management team and it shows in the staff and service.  Decor: There are no words to describe the decor of Maison Arabe. Every little nook and cranny is a mystical adventure with priceless pieces of Art which arouse the senses. One is surrounded by an ambience of relaxed beauty which immediately puts one into ""chill out"" mode.  This is not however a ""stuffy"" hotel. One can feel very comfortable arriving at breakfast in a robe after a morning dip in the pool. Yes you will want to dress for dinner in the evening but even at lunch one day we were happy to dine in our robes following a morning by the pool.  STAFF ; From reception to housekeeping it is rare to find a team of staff which is 100% perfect. Score ten out of ten Maison Arabe. Special mention to Abdullah (sp?) who looked after us a great deal and felt on many occasions like our own personal butler. Head Barman Rachid and his great team of barmen are excellent and add the fun element into Maison Arabe.  The girls by the restaurant smiling helpful and just a joy to spend time with.  FOOD- out of this world! The lamb tegine oooooh wonderful!!! I am gluten free and very rare do I get to enjoy bread. Maison Arabe made me very special breads which I will forever more yearn for!!!  Costs: yes we spent a little more than we intended. My husband however never begrudes us spends when we are 100% happy and enjoying ourselves. We did overdo the champagne.. but - ooooh boy did we have a good time :)  Rooms: We loved our room and were lucky enough to experience a beautiful suite on our last days. With a rooftop terrace to die for quite an awesome experience! To lunch on this rooftop and relax in the tub under the scorching Moroccan sunshine..aaaahhhh bliss!!  Our one regret was on the night we were staying in the suite we had already organised dinner at the Amanjena. We wish so much we had just stayed at Maison Arabe. The Amanjena was not up to par with my previous experience there. Food was poor and having paid £350 for a bottle of Bollinger we would expect not to have to pour it ourselves! Wont do that next time for sure! We wish so much we had stayed put in Maison Arabe but hey it wont be out last visit for sure.  Maison Arabe's country club is very beautiful. It could do with a better bar service but our Abdullah came to the rescue there quickly dashed over from Maison Arabe and ensured our day there was simply perfect!  We are ""party people"" and for that we grabbed a taxi through the day to Nikki Beach which we do love. But so nice at the end of the day to return ""home"" to Maison Arabe.  My husband can be hard to please at times he rarely comes back from a vacation ranting on and on and on about how good his time was. For sure he is already trying to plan another trip!  For a short haul flight from Scotland this is a real find for us. We know we can grab a last minute break whenever we have a window of opportunity. I think Maison Arabe will be welcoming us for many years to come..  See you soon Insha'Allah",Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sunscot

The reception staff were very efficient and friendly at all times and we were straight away given a tour of the hotel.  Our rooms were excellent with alittle courtyard in between which was ideal to have a pre dinner drink. I loved the decor very authentic and arabic.  We were woken up by the ""Call to Prayers "" at 3 and 5 in the morning but the way around that was to close the windows and put on the air conditioning.  I very much enjoyed the spa although my friend was not happy with one of her treatments. The manager apologised straight away and offered something to make amends.  The hotel is 10 minutes from the souk.  We took part in one of the cookery coursesrun by the hotel it was the highlight ot the holiday.  Beautiful clean kitchen a trip to the local bakery which was just an oven in the wall with locals coming in to have their own dough baked fascinating.

La Maison Arabe,JolyonG wrote a review Oct 2011,50,Wonderful stay at La Maison Arabe in Marrakech's Medina,We decided to visit Marrakech for some late Autumn sun and some exotic North African flavour. We reviewed the available Riad style hotels and were impressed by the facilities of La Maison Arabe with their country club and the relative value for money against other properties.    La Maison Arabe could not have been more helpful with the booking process and arranging the airport pick up. On arrival we were welcomed very warmly and guided to our suite for the first night which was beautifully appointed with its own private patio. As the hotel was full and we had booked late for our second and third nights we were transferred to a junior room which was plenty big enough with a shared patio on the first floor.    The hotel’s location is ideal being some twelve minutes’ walk north of Djemaa El Fna and the souks. In addition the hotel has its own country club which is some fifteen minutes by complimentary shuttle where there is a large swimming pool restaurant/beverage facilities and beautiful gardens. On the Sunday of our stay we were fortunate enough to be the only guests enjoying these facilities.    We ate in both of the hotel’s restaurants – Le Restaurant (Moroccan) and Les Trois Saveurs (French Moroccan and Asian). Both were excellent with friendly and knowledgably service. Breakfasts were a real treat as there is a Moroccan Lady who makes local pancakes to order with a multitude of savoury fillings.    The hotel also offers its widely renowned cooking classes which one of us attended. These take place in the specially appointed teaching kitchen and include visits to a local communal baker and spice shop. Having each prepared a Chicken and Preserved Lemon Tagine with Moroccan Salad we then sat down and ate it – delicious!    In short this is an excellent choice for your base in Marrakech with the added bonus of being able to retreat to the country club should you feel the need for some additional R&R.

It was like finding an oasis after slogging through the desert.    The riad is a beautiful old structure with a great sense of history. Room was lovely and I sat where Churchill would eat his dinner and smoke his cigars back when the riad was a well known restaurant. Too bad I didn't have a cigar.    We liked the restaurant and ate there twice depsite the multitude of choices in Marrakech. The lamb was great and the local Meknes wine was a good complement. The highlight for e though was the melt in your mouth ice cream - I recommend the pistacchio and the chocolate.    My wife loved the hamman and I felt par boiled ready for the plate after a half hour in the steam room. Loved that they had a cold shower inside the steam room to help keep from getting too hot.    Service from the front desk was very professional and they couldn't do enought to assist.

La Maison Arabe,danfortuna wrote a review Sep 2011,50,Simply superb!,We picked La Maison Arabe for a three-night stay in Marrakech and the hotel and city were the high point of our trip. I can't say enough about what an oasis of calm and luxury this hotel is! We were treated like royalty by the staff. We had a room (not a suite) and it was spacious very well appointed and was our 'palace' for our stay in Morocco. Everyone we met on the staff was warm and helpful. We had mint tea brought to the room and the staff delivered fresh flowers for Paige. We ate most of our meals in the hotel -- breakfasts were outstanding with fresh yogurt fruit eggs rolls/pastries and coffee (though I missed American-style coffee...). Dinner was a choice of two restaurants -- we opted for the one serving Moroccan French and Asian. There's another with a fixed-price Moroccan menu we didn't try. Meals were excellent and unhurried. The hotel's common areas including the restaurant were all beautifully decorated - I must have taken a hundred photos. I signed up for the cooking class (recommended if you want to learn to cook Moroccan food like tagines) and Paige did the hammam treatment. The location was within fairly easy walks of most of the old city's hotspots but beware of getting lost -- everyone we spoke with did at first. There's an excellent piano lounge in the hotel (with a colorful bartender). We also spent one afternoon at the hotel's 'country club' a short shuttle ride away with a pool and food service. All in all I highly recommend this hotel -- it's like a riad in terms of local authenticity and atmosphere but large enough to offer great dining and more.,Date of stay: September 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Richmond,Virginia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danfortuna
La Maison Arabe,GingernutMixer wrote a review Sep 2011,40,"Wonderful meal, fantastic cookery course but beware of glass in the hammam",We didn’t stay at the Maison Arabe but we were there most days for a spa treatment meal drink or cookery course.    The cookery course was brilliant we all managed to cook wonderful dishes and it was a real highlight of our Marrakech trip. The restaurant and jazz bar are also excellent. The one downside was our visit to their hammam. It all looks very pretty with candles burning in glass holders all around the dark steaming hammam although a little risk management would suggest that glass flames and steam are a dangerous combination. We paddled naked through the shallow water on the hammam floor and my husband and I each sat down on a bench. I felt a twinge in my finger and when I looked down there was blood pouring down my hand. I then started looking around the bench and floor and there were shards of glass everywhere. I told the masseuse that we were leaving and that we wanted to use the other hammam. I then carefully led my husband out as he is blind without his glasses.    The masseuse just didn’t understand what the fuss was about. She suggested that we try and pick up the pieces of glass and carry on. I was very insistent that the hammam be completely cleaned or we use the other hammam. We were offered tea while the hammam was cleaned and after about half an hour the other hammam became free so we then had a lovely invigorating treatment followed by a relaxing massage.    When we came to pay a 10% service charge was added to the bill and there was no apology for the hazardous state of the hammam. We were very lucky not to have been seriously hurt.    When we were back at the Maison Arabe a couple of days later for the cookery course we mentioned to the course leader about our dissatisfaction with the way the hammam incident had been dealt with. She was horrified and went and told the manager who immediately refunded the cost of the hammam. I hope that they no longer use glass in the hammams but if they do please be careful.,Date of stay: March 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Seaford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GingernutMixer

La Maison Arabe,Michael076 wrote a review Aug 2011,50,Wow 10/10 in every regard but one,This was just a 'time off' 3 days on a business trip and now I can't wait to go back.    Everything was good here - the friendly and personal service the atmosphere the meals the service the hammam ...    But first the only negative and its not part of the hotel. La Maison Arabe is very close to a major mosque and the ~dawn call to prayer and the PRE-call to prayer before that will wake you several times before 6am. I'm told that its hard to escape anywhere in Marrakesh (at least) but here you can rely on being woken. But it wasn't sufficient to offset an otherwise great time even though noise is one of my major issues in hotels.    The general atmosphere is welcoming cosy and very Moroccan; fresh roses and rose petals on water features cool courtyards clubby lounges all serene and charming.    The eating options are superb. Breakfast is served by the pool on a terrace and was delicious (fresh fruits yoghurt with honey pastries ... you get the idea). In the evening you can relax in a cozy bar with piano player a good wine list and attentive staff.    Rooms are well appointed and stylish; beds are a bit hard in the Arab style but not too bad.    The in-house hammam was a bit expensive but worth it to totally unwind.    Basically a marvelous experience but unless you are an early riser take ear plugs.,Date of stay: January 2011,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Melbourne, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michael076

Breakfast was good and plentiful and taken next to the outdoor pool. Service was great and the hammam was an experience (private but still invigorating).    Our one and only criticism is that it is located very near to a mosque so we were woken up at 4:30am. However this did add to the atmosphere!    It's in a good location not too far a walk from the centre but away from the traffic.

La Maison Arabe,operacat wrote a review Jul 2011,50,"Lovely, Exciting, A Perfect Moroccan Experience","It's hard to know where to begin. I had been working with Nabila the Manager and Fatima  the Director of Reservations for three years; arranging a 10-day ""0"" birthday event for 30 or  so guests. Never having been to Morocco before I was flying blind in a way. I'd scoured  the internet for hotels and riads to accommodate the group. First I thought I'd have the party  at La Mamounia as it is very beautiful and famous. But I finally decided that I wanted a  small riad in the Madina which was easy walking distance to the square.    La Maison Arabe is large for a riad but very small for a hotel. It is the best marriage of the two. It is made of of six riads which have been joined together; so there are many levels.  It is every bit a riad and decorated in beautiful Moroccan style. But it has all the services  that one wants in a hotel: Laundry spa pool two restaurants a bar A/C room safes  great water pressure an elevator in one section and room service. The hotel desk staff  will also arrange guides who are delightful and considerate of what each guest wants to  see or do.    Each room there are 26 in all is different and they range from two Royal Suites with  three levels to a few very small rooms which have the best patios. Most of the rooms  are very ample for two.    The location is prime. One can drive or be driven to the mouth of a rather shabby alley  only to step into this perfect Moroccan paradise. It's a gem and a surprise of great  beauty and charm.    Every member of the staff is kind helpful and knows his or her job. Nabila the general  manager knows what you need before you do. They are caring and helpful and make  the guest feel like part of an extended family. Also the gentlemen at the desk; Adil and  the others are the same. They know their business and are kind and friendly. This  applies to all staff from housekeepers to managers to the owners; who are there often  and make it a point to greet the guests and make sure everything is going well.    I did not take a cooking class but several of my guests did and they were all very happy  with the result. The classes are limited to 10 and the class is taken to the market to buy  the food and spices do the cooking and have the meal together afterward. The kitchen  or classroom is new modern and ultra clean.    I was a bit worried about what I would find not being able to go to Marrakech to check  out the hotel/riad first but I needent have worried. Everything is first rate. I am beyond  thrilled that I chose La Maison Arabe for my party. I almost forgot to mention what they  call ""The Country Club"". This is a large romantic garden with a very large pool about  ten minutes away by shuttle. This is an hourly free service. One can enjoy lunch drinks  and a swim. There is also a large stationary party tent for special events. The staff  at the hotel organized a beautiful perty for my birthday. They put so much time and  effort into what turned out to be a magnificent event.    This was truly a magical ten days and the staff and owners of La Maison Arabe were  largely responsible. Marrakech is full of gorgeous and/or charming places to stay but I  could never find a better place.    I have only two caviats: There are stairs; sometimes just a few and sometimes many.  If a person cannot use stairs at all it will be a problem. Also though all ages are  admitted. This is not a place for children. People go there for an ambience of peace  and quiet. Even in the brochure parents are told that children must be quiet.    All my guests are world and worldly travelers and can be quite fussy. Every one of them  were extremely pleased with La Maison Arabe and their extraordinary staff. They have  a very complete and beautiful web site in which they show all the rooms. That alone is  a very good sign.",Date of stay: June 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Los Angeles, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/operacat

Rashid the barman was easy going and friendly without being ""overly-friendly"".

The food was very good and the service everywhere was very attentive. One night while we were at Le Foundouk (great place) and running late to the belly dancing show (Comptoir Bar) Ibrihim called our driver and asked to speak to me to be sure that we were okay (since we were late).

We also had the traditional hammam there and massage and that was also fantastic.  Room service was great we ordered our breakfast in our room everyday which was a lovely luxury.

They sent people to the chemist for me and brought tea to our rooms.  They really went over and above.  The fact that we received complimentary upgrade to a suite definitely doesn't hurt their case for a great review either.  Was sad to leave and would love to go back.,Date of stay: December 2010,,"Sydney, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adamhof

Can't wait to go back!,My husband and I got married on December 4th and decided to go to Morocco for our honeymoon. When we arrived at Maison Arabe we couldn't stop smiling - it was romantic and beautiful on every level and in every sense. From the amazing room with fireplace and balcony to the wonderful breakfast poolside and the delightful heated pool to the gorgeous and sexy hammam and jazz bar we are planning to try and come back every year on our anniversary. The staff were all kind and extremely accommodating and the location was terrific. We can't say enough extraordinary things about this place and are so happy it was part of our honeymoon.,Date of stay: December 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,New York,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Labewene
La Maison Arabe,katroberts wrote a review Dec 2010,50,You will leave feeling like royalty!,"From the time we got to the riad to the taxi leaving we were greeted with the best service you could imagine! The small riad is home to a maze of winding stairs with two great restaurants enchanting live music and memories you won't forget! After having a great meal one of the nights we decided we wanted to have the tea back in our room. After asking if the tea in our room was possible the server replied ""For you all is possible!"" (We decided that was the motto at this riad!) We left the restaurant then noticed one of the servers at the restaurant door waiting for us to leave to follow us with tea and cookies. We arrived to the room and to our surprise noticed for the second time in one day the room was cleaned! After we sat down to enjoy our tea we busted out laughing because we really did feel like a king and queen!    The riad does have a really nice hammam but is very pricy. The hammam (spa) is something you absolutely have to experience! Just look in some guide books to tell you the best one to go to!    Walking distance to the medina was not bad at all and we found it very safe! There is not much nightlife we found outside the riad but the riad is complete with a piano bar and plenty of room to enjoy the riad and friends at night.",Date of stay: November 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Austin, Texas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katroberts

Set down an unassuming alley way you walk through a beautiful doorway into an delightful reception area and then it only gets better - a beautiful restraunt by the pool the jazz bar the Morrocan restraunt the hamman the staff - I could go on and on about the place but in short it is a magnificent place to stay.    My partner and I did the cookery course which is a must. A tour around the local souks and then making new foods was excellent. Aida and Mohammed the chef were brilliant and Mohammed spoke in more excellent english than I.    If you want a luxurious yet unassuming place to stay then this is it. The staff are polite accomodating and most of all lovely with no request to much.

La Maison Arabe,artisanpr wrote a review Dec 2010,50,Fantastic cookery course,My husband and I attended a half day cookery course at Maison Arabe. It starts with an introduction to Morrocan cuisine followed by 45 mins out and about visiting a local bakery and spice store. You then head to the kitchen to cook your own fabulous chicken tagine and two different Moroccan salads. All of the instruction is given in French and English. Whilst things are cooking you are given more information and the chef demonstrates a few extra dishes. You then head off to sit in the courtyard by the pool and enjoy the delicious lunch you have made. You get complimentary water and dessert plus are given a lovely tagine dish to take home. There were eight people on our course 4 english speakers and 4 french ( 6 female 2 male). It started at 10am and we were still there at 3.30pm enjoy a chat and drink with some of the other attendees.    The course ( everything included) cost us 500dh - about £40 per person which we felt was excellent value.    We were also given a tour of the hotel and returned that night to the jazz bar where you can enjoy live music tapas and wonderful cocktails.    Great course in a stunning hotel. Also a really good way for solo travellers to meet new people.,Date of stay: December 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Scottish Borders,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/artisanpr

After a quick review of the basic ingredients used in Moroccan food Chef Mohammed and I took a walk to a nearby spice shop to get a first hand look and sniff at the fresh spices. I had to have just a few!! Back in the kitchen Chef Mohammed and his sous chef taught me step by step to make a basic tajine and some fresh salads to go with it.

La Maison Arabe,grwebster wrote a review Oct 2010,50,It just doesn't get any better than this,We have stayed at La Maison Arabe several times over the years and each time we return there have been new additions and surprises. Originally a private home it has been continually enlarged and expanded - since our last visit 7 years ago an addition with a large heated pool restaurant with terrace over looking the pool new very well appointed rooms have appeared. Always well staffed with friendly and well trained people they have added even more. The Spa is world class according to my wife who has visited them all over the world.  The hotel is hidden from the busy streets and yet is only a minute walk to the covered souk/market.  One outstanding offering is their fabulous garden compound reached by their own car service about 15 minutes away in the palm gardens on the outskirts of the town. This facility includes a beautifully maintained garden growing vegetables for their restaurants plants palms and fig trees a huge outdoor pool with open cabanas. There is a fig tree shaded garden restaurant and a tent-like pavilion for evening parties {we had our wedding reception there years ago}. The main building has a large reception area and on the second floor their own cooking school. A wonderful way to relax after visits to the inner city of Marrakech.  All meals were excellent at the main hotel and the gardens.  This trip we returned with our 3 children and two nannies. The children were adopted by the staff and enjoyed their stay. We also spent a day at the Garden Pavilion where they were fee to chase the kittens and roan inside the walled gardens.

La Maison Arabe,Aprilvisitor wrote a review Oct 2010,50,Lovely riad,Stayed 2 nights in this lovely place that is based around a traditional riad but carefully and tastefully modernised so offers a number of addtional hotel services without loosing its authentic Morrocan feel. Everything was excellent and it was probably the best hotel we have stayed at anywhere. We stayed in a suite in the old part of the building which was spacious extremely comfortable and interestingly laid out around its own mini courtyard. The jazz / piano bar adds an extra dimension where we happily spent one evening being entertained by the pianist and the lively bar staff. The Morrocan Restaurant is superb - the food the service and the decor and is worth a visit even if you don't stay at the hotel. The same is true of the cookery school which we did in the lovely setting of the hotel's country club where we learnt to cook a delicious chicken olive and lemon tangine which we then ate in the delightful Berber tent in the grounds. The class is suitable for any level of cook from beginner to the more experienced as the cooks and translator are very friendly and offer as much help as you want. Service throughout our stay was outstanding. We will definitely return when we can.,Date of stay: October 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Wales, Uk",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aprilvisitor
La Maison Arabe,Reuters wrote a review Oct 2010,50,Low key luxury,"We decided to stay at La Maison Arabe following quite a bit of web research. We decided we wanted to stay at somewhere larger then the typical Riad but smaller then a full blown hotel. La Maison Arabe fitted the bill perfectly both in terms of size (around 30 rooms/suites in total) and facilities (Spa restaurants country club cooking school etc). We had a fantastic break and would highly recommend this boutique hotel.    Accommodation - we booked a junior suite (patio side) and were upgraded on arrival to the slightly more expensive garden sided junior suite.    We stayed in the Nada suite and I would recommend you look at the accommodation section on La Maison Arabe's website as the pictures are a true representation of the rooms.    Our room was very spacious and comfortable with 2 large plasma TV's and a lovely balcony overlooking the pool. The bed was firm and comfortable and the hotel was very efficient at responding to our request to replace the oversized pillows supplied with slightly smaller ones.    The bathroom was more than adequate with a separate shower/bath and a large and powerful shower head.    There is also free WiFi throughout the hotel.    It is about a 10/15 minute walk to the main square/Souk so during the day it is possible to get around on foot.    Finally be aware that there is a local mosque nearby which does its 1st call-to-prayer at 4am (!) - that if nothing else makes you fully aware that you are in Marrekech!    Country Club - one of the attractions for us was the use of the hotel's country club on the outskirts of the city. Although there is a pool in the hotel the country club gives it something extra - it allowed us to spend a day relaxing by its pool and is the perfect opposite to the hustle and bustle of Marakkech. The weather in early October was still warm enough for us to swim in the pool and we really enjoyed the 4 or 5 hours we spent there. The hotel runs a regular free shuttle to/from the country club.    Spa - the spa seems newly refurbished although offered a relatively small range of treatments. While my wife and I both had treatments which we enjoyed I found it quite expensive and with hindsight should have booked the well-rated ""Les Bains de Marrakech"" in advance (- we tried to book on arrival but they were fully booked...).    Cooking School - the on-site cooking school was another reason for us booking this hotel. My wife enjoys cooking and spent a great afternoon learning about Moroccan cooking.    Food/drink - While not cheap the food and drink was top notch and nothing is too much trouble ( - for example they smiled and quickly accommodated my wife's lunch request for a tuna sandwich without bread!). We ate at the hotel's restaurant on our final night and found the food to be very good although the service on that evening was not perfect. There is also a very chilled jazz bar for pre-dinner drinks.    Staff - all staff that we came into contact with were extremely helpful and pleasant. Indeed this is probably this factor that made our stay at La Maison Arabe so enjoyable and why we have given it 5-stars in this review.    Conclusion - Marrakech is a fantastic location for a short break from the UK and La Maison Arabe is the perfect place to base yourself. There are undoubtedly flashier places to stay in this city (both La Mamoumia and Naoura Barriiere are within a 10 minute walk of La Maison Arabe) but for a cosy yet luxurious stay I don't think you will go wrong with this hotel.",Date of stay: October 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reuters

It was clean comfortable the staff were very friendly and attentive – they have clearly been trained very well. It was wonderful waking up every day to such beauty every where you look there is details in the way of carvings the quality of the décor the lighting etc.    There is also a lovely swimming pool with a private terraced area with sunbeds for sunbathing or relaxing with complimentary towels.  The Spa is heaven and once you have had your treatment there is an area in which you can relax for as long as you want whilst listening to soothing Moroccan music.    Breakfast consits of pastries pancakes fresh fruit etc. We ate at the restaurant near the pool and I was surprised by how delicious and incredibly tasty the food was. It was really really good!! Even the club sandwich was the best I have ever had. Please note a 10% service charge will be added on top of anything extra you have at the hotel.    In terms of location its perfect: only a 10-15 minute walk into the main square or you can take a taxi for about 20-30 Dirham.    I have to say that staying at this hotel was actually one of the highlights of my trip because I felt I was getting a real taste of Morocco without even leaving the hotel!

This time I experienced the next wing they added which makes a huge difference. They had added a swimming pool in the hotel in town so you have a choice - you can swim after walking through the medina shopping or you can spend your day at the country club a short ride away from town on their free shuttle service. Their Trois Saveurs restaurant is fabulous...you can get traditional Moroccan food (the Pidgeon pastilla is exquisite) and also thai and international dishes for those who are tired of tagine and couscous every day. One reviewer mentioned the grand marnier souffle - the lemon one with ice cream inside wasn't too shabby either! YUMMY! The Hammam is gorgeous and the services fantastic.

I had booked the Royal Suite at nearby Riad Kniza but our reservation for five nights had got lost between their e-mail system and their hard copy desk diary.Kamal the owner/manage offered us a ""standard"" room/suite at no charge for the day/night of our arrival and because he was full as recompense booked us into La Maison Arab and paid room costs for half our remaining four nights stay. The suite on the first floor with terrace overlooking the pool was spacious and very comfortable. For 350Dh /night they promptly supplied a spare bed for our son who joined us later.    We ate ""Moroccan"" once. The food was good and service also but it was far too expensive for what it was. Including 10% charged for service our meal for three with wine was just under 1900Dh. The other restaurant by the pool was far better value. Breakfast was satisfactory without being outstanding. The freshly squeezed orange juice and grapefruit juice dispensers were so loaded with ice that the juices were heavily diluted and their true flavours lost. Eggs ordered at table were always cooked as requested. No hard cheeses were offered until requested. Coffee was full of flavour and very strong and served in insulated flasks...perfect.    Our room was serviced twice daily by courteous staff. It was a pity that our room service ordered breakfast [noted by staff the night before our very early departure] did not come as specified.    We were as above looking forward to a Riad. This is a hotel in a Medina full of riads. The authentic Moroccan experience is therefore somewhat lost. You pays your money and takes your choice.

La Maison Arabe,julatlanta wrote a review Sep 2010,50,An ideal place to stay in beautiful (and hot) Marrakech,After endless weeks of research including many hours spent on Tripadvisor we chose La Maison Arabe as our hotel in Marrakech as it was one of only a handful of places that offered the following things that were important to us:  1. a medina location yet with parking as we would be arriving by rental car from Casablanca and traveling with a lot of luggage  2. ideally a riad but we were looking for something larger than a 4-6 room B&B type of place  3. swimming pool (we were going in July and so were expecting it to be hot – it was!)  4. air conditioning was a must  5. restaurant at the hotel  6. ideally an elevator (we are senior citizens)  La Maison Arabe was the perfect size; it has all the warmth and personalized service of a private club combined with the benefits of a larger hotel such as a great front desk room service bar. Our room was large and beautifully decorated and had a terrace overlooking the swimming pool. The pool was much larger than what we were expecting at a riad-hotel. There were 3 flights of stairs between our room and the poolside area where breakfast was served so the elevator ended up coming in very handy. I don’t think all the rooms at the hotel are accessible by elevator so you should double-check this if it's important for you.  The staff could not have been friendlier or more professional and always seemed to be there when we wanted something. We were pleasantly surprised by the level of English spoken by the staff. I thought I’d have to dust off what remains of my high school French but it wasn’t necessary.  The food at La Maison Arabe was out of this world. The Moroccan-French menu offered many fish dishes which was great for us as neither my wife or I eat meat. The restaurant serves delicious Moroccan wines (one of the great discoveries of our trip).  I should mention that Marrakech in July was VERY hot -- you should consider this if planning a trip to Morocco.,Date of stay: July 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Atlanta, Georgia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julatlanta
La Maison Arabe,samk10 wrote a review Aug 2010,50,Amazing - Best Experience of the Trip,Having never been to Marrakech or Morocco before we were recommended to stay at La Maison Arabe by a friend who had previously stayed there.    Staying here was the best part of our trip.    The staff we extremely friendly and very helpful. Not sure why the previous review said the lady at the front desk had made fun of her.    I started a review on every aspect of the hotel but it was so full of praises that it went on and on and I feared would not be read. So I will make this short and sweet.    You will not regret staying here. Every aspect of the hotel is impeccable. From the rooms to the food to the incredible location right next to the souk and within in arms reach of all attractions.    The staff were fantastic. Every restaurant guide hotels in other parts of Morocco and experiences La Maison Arabe organised for us to do were spot on and they listened to everything we asked for and fulfilled the requests immediately.    One of the best parts of this hotel is its country club. The hotel owns another piece of land about a 10 minute drive from the hotel. They have a shuttle bus that take guests to and from the Country Club. The Country Club is the most beautiful relaxing part of the hotel. With amazing cactus gardens and a brilliant pool that you can lye by all day this is not to be missed.    We spent our mornings with private guides and drivers that the hotel organised for us to discover different parts of Marrakech they were not expensive and very good. And then the afternoons were spent by the pool at the country club where you can wine dine and just relax.    There is also a cooking school that the hotel runs which we were told by other guests was the best part of their trip. Unfortunately we ran out of time to par take and are very disappointed by that.    The Staff were fantastic. Especially the staff who work behind the front desk. Having never been to Morocco before they helped us with every aspect of our 10 day trip and even booked other accommodation for us in Fes and other Morccoan towns. Which was also outstanding.    The Spa was also terrific. I highly recommend you treat yourself to a pampering session here if time allows.    There are so many other wonderful things about this hotel like its bar and reading room that I simply do not have time to mention them all.    All I can say is you will not be disappointed one bit by your experience if you stay at this hotel. The Owner is divine and always present on site to make sure things are running smoothly.

La Maison Arabe,slim109 wrote a review Jul 2010,20,Very nice hotel ... but the woman at the desk was quite rude and made fun of me.,"Let me start out by saying that I have never written a bad review. When something happens I usually let little things roll off my back.    Anyway we arrived at the hotel and were greeted by the doorman who was quite nice. We didn't have a reservation and so we inquired about the price at the front desk. The doorman greeted us in English (we look quite American) and so we began speaking in English at the desk. We were told the price and went upstairs to check on the room. When we came back down asked if there was a slightly cheaper room as this room was a little pricey for us. The woman at the desk let out a large exasperated sigh and went to check out the computer. She quoted another price for a small junior suite and my wife and I talked about the price for at most thirty seconds with each other. During this time the woman at the desk was acting like we were taking about half an hour. Moments later we decided to stay and were given our keys. About this time another couple came up to the desk and as we were filling out our passport information the woman at the desk started making fun of us in Darija which is the type of Arabic that is spoken in Morocco. My wife speaks Darija!!!! She was standing there acting cool making fun of the ""stupid Americans"" right in front of us thinking that we couldn't understand what she was saying. As we were leaving I heard her saying in French to a guest who had just walked up to the desk how cheap we were and something about being capitalist snobs. I was nothing but nice to her.    For a nicer hotel this was not the kind of service that I expected. When we got up to the room and I mention to my wife that she was making fun of us in French she said that the clerk was making fun of us in Darija. We were nothing but nice to her.    Other than that the stay was as you would expect. The pool was nice although it close early.

La Maison Arabe,sonyadc wrote a review Jun 2010,50,Elegant and Refined,We recently took advantage of a “4 nights for the price of 3” promotion at La Maison Arabe and chose a Junior Suite (“Layle”) which was just perfect overlooking the hotel’s swimming pool. It was beautifully decorated with lots of closet space and a leather-panelled wall behind the bed (which was the most comfortable by far during our entire trip to Morocco).  There is a European elegance at this hotel that I was not expecting to find in Morocco. It seemed that every object has been chosen and placed with an incredible eye and taste. The salons and bar in the older wing of the hotel particularly impressed me – everything seemed so refined and luxurious but never ostentatious or overdone.  The word refined – as well as efficient – can also be used to describe the staff at La Maison Arabe. Everyone spoke a decent level of English which was not the case at the other hotels we stayed at in Morocco.  The use of the hotel’s stunning country annex swimming pool was a big and unexpected bonus. We were told it is reserved only for hotel guests which makes sense as there were only 3 other couples there both afternoons that we went.  My husband and I stayed in one evening and ate at the hotel’s international restaurant which ended up being the best meal on our entire trip. It was also the most romantic meal accompanied by excellent guitar and lute players. We lingered on long after our dessert (a delicious Grand Marnier soufflé) to keep listening to them.

La Maison Arabe,Eatdrinkgo wrote a review May 2010,50,Exceptional!!,A quiet charming alleyway lined with potted trees make this hideaway a special retreat from the madness of the streets. Beautiful rooms and a spa not to be missed. The restaurant by the pool is amazing. We loved it so much that we ate there several nights! My best meals in Morocco were at this place! When you've had enough touring and shopping take the complimentary shuttle to the pool resort they have food and beverage service there that you can charge to your room. Quiet and peaceful to regroup. Be warned that if you have sensitive skin the scrub down in the hamman may be too intense for you but if you're ok with it it's a great experience followed by a full massage--heaven......wish I was there now.,Date of stay: April 2010,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Los Angeles, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eatdrinkgo
La Maison Arabe,Stenew wrote a review May 2010,50,Perfection,"I stayed one week at La Maison Arabe with my wife and one other couple. This is the PERFECT hotel--we tried both the ""old wing"" as well as new rooms and both were perfect. Very comfortable with all the modern conveniences but with tons of old world charm. The food is first rate and served in beautiful surroundings. The staff could not be more hospitable-one evening they walked us across town to try a restaurant that we would have had troubles finding on our own. The Hammam is a must.

La Maison Arabe,pontian wrote a review Apr 2010,50,A Moroccan Jewel,Staying at this beautiful hotel in the medina of Marrakech was one of the highlights of our recent trip to Morocco. La Maison Arabe is the perfect size not too small not too big; we felt like we were staying at a private club and were treated like royalty throughout our 4 days here. The service was excellent comparable to what we experienced years ago at certain hotels in Asia. The front desk staff was particularly helpful; nothing seemed to be a problem for them and everything was done efficiently and with a smile. The hotel is full of intimate and private spaces each a bit different but all beautifully decorated and they all flowed seamlessly from one to another. Every day I would discover something new. What a feast for the eyes! The biggest surprise for us was the hotel’s country annex which is just outside the city (the front desk arranges your transportation there). There is a second large swimming pool here set in beautifully landscaped gardens. After 3 days of non-stop sightseeing and too much shopping (we had to pay excess weight on my luggage!) this was the perfect place to just unwind before our trip home. Our next trip to Morocco will be to explore the southern region beyond the Atlas Mountains (we just didn’t have enough time on this trip) and we will certainly begin and end that vacation in Marrakech at this enchanting hotel.,Date of stay: March 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Dallas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pontian
La Maison Arabe,twinsma wrote a review Apr 2010,20,Tired Hotel,"I was worried that his riad may be tired as it existed and was popular 10 years ago when I was in Morocco on my honeymoon. I researched asked questions read reviews interrogated travel agents and ultimately decided to stay here for a few nights in Marrakech because the answers were really all positive and the rate for the large suite we needed (with 2 young children) was a bit better than others I considered. Unfortunately I was right to be suspicious. It is a ""tired"" hotel with a somewhat shabby lobby and worn carpets etc. Paying around $800 a night I expected more. I guess you just don't get much these days. Additionally the service and food at breakfast (which is included in most Moroccan hotels) was the worst we experienced in the country. It was so bad we thought about where else to run to to feed our kids in the morning just to avoid the experience even though we had already paid for it. It was a real bummer as I spent countless hours choosing our hotels. This was my biggest disappointment.

La Maison Arabe,linusbos wrote a review Feb 2010,50,Understated chic,I spent a lot of time on this website and burying myself in several guide books before our trip. There seem to be so many wonderful hotels in Marrakech; I had a very hard time choosing where to stay. We finally chose La Maison Arabe which had been unanimously recommended by my guide books . I must say that La Maison Arabe lived up to their glowing descriptions. The decor and service is elegant understated and chic. From the doors to the artwork to the gorgeous teardrop shaped lanterns to the rugs – everything seems to have been chosen with incredible taste and sense of harmony. I worked for many years in the design business and was very impressed.  Marrakech is an amazing city and should not be missed. You can easily include it on a trip to Spain as we did. The flight was only 1 ½ hours.  Back to this hotel the service and cuisine at La Maison Arabe was far superior to what we have experienced at many “5 star” establishments both on this trip and others. I enthusiastically recommend this place.,Date of stay: January 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Boston,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/linusbos
La Maison Arabe,celfohr wrote a review Jan 2010,50,Flawless!,My husband and I recently spent a week in Marrakech for New Year’s and stayed at La Maison Arabe. We really could not find fault with this hotel. Our room was in the older wing and was exquisitely decorated and had a small private terrace. The service was impeccable at a much higher level than we were expecting. Our room was freshened up at least 2-3 times a day.  The reception areas of the hotel and bar are drop-dead gorgeous (and the very friendly bartender – Rashid? – makes a mean cocktail!). The swimming pool was heated which was a big plus for us in late December. The food was outstanding; the hotel has two restaurants: a Moroccan one (I’m still remembering the braised lamb shoulder!) and a top-notch International restaurant where we ate 2 evenings.,Date of stay: December 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Denver,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/celfohr
La Maison Arabe,janeblogs wrote a review Jan 2010,50,A Little Piece of Heaven,It was such a joy to stay at La Maison Arabe for so many reasons. Not the least because during the Christmas/New Year period this year it was pouring with rain and quite chilly in Marrakech. It was heaven to come home to glowing open fires beautiful floral arrangements fresh tangerines a welcome cup of tea or stiff martini.    In truth it is probably more boutique hotel than riad but the Moroccan detail and atmosphere is everywhere the choice of restaurants and the quality of food the free wireless internet the charm of the barmen and all the staff makes it a true stand out. Maybe in better weather those things may not have been important but during my stay I really valued those comforts and the high level of service and the variety of facilities offered in house. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming and the staff of which there are many are so unobtrusive and delightful.    It was too cool to swim but it has a beautiful pool on site and another just out of Marrakech which would be divine in the warmer weather - a great break from the madness of the medina. All age groups were staying singles couples some families and all nationalities so it was really a delightful experience.,Date of stay: December 2009,Trip type: Traveled solo,Worldwide,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janeblogs
La Maison Arabe,Valiant2 wrote a review Dec 2009,40,Difficult to improve upon I would think,"La Maison Arabe is one of a large number of riads that has sprung up in Marrakech over the past ten years or so. Based upon visiting a few others to eat I would say it is more ""full service"" than most which probably would improve further its appeal the longer the stay.    We stayed just for 3 nights on a long weekend break. We took a Standard Suite (""Shehrazade"") lovely decor comfortable exceptional standards of housekeeping nice touches such as a dialy-replenished basket of dried fruits and nuts.    The riad had many public areas of great beauty and tranquility: almost too many really as it was not a busy time of the year (apparently quite quiet for a Christmas influx). There are two restaurants the ""international"" one where we had breakfast lunch on the first day and took the complimentary afternoon tea. We rarely saw anyone else eating there other than for breakfast.    In the main body of the hotel there was an ""arabic"" restuarant: this was probably the least impressive of the 3 evening meals we had in Marrakech although still very good as the general standard of food was excellent throughout our stay.    We used the baths once but a highlight was the cookery school where we cooked our own tagine lunch. The hotel's main pool is at a different location served by regular shuttles: this was set in lovely gardens though is I imagine best in warm weather (Marrkech was a little wet the weekend we were there).

La Maison Arabe,flx67 wrote a review Dec 2009,50,Outstanding. Just perfect.,This hotel is out-of-this world. It is located in the medina (old part) of Marrakech and very close to the Jema el Fna square. When we arrived we thought our driver had made a mistake as there is no grand entrance etc but once you walk through the doors and start exploring the hotel – WOW. I have rarely seen such attention to detail both in the decoration and in the service. The staff is very friendly and attentive without being overbearing. We just couldn’t believe it as the service in all the other hotels we had stayed in throughout Morocco left a lot to be desired and we thought this was just the norm for the country. We stayed in the “Noor” suite which was a jewel…it had 2 private terraces and a gorgeous bathroom done in exquisite Moroccan tiles. The medina of Marrakech can be somewhat hectic and crazy – so it was always a pleasure returning to the beautiful oasis which is this hotel. The hotel spa is incredible; we did a hammam (steam bath) followed by one of the best massages I have had in a long time. Breakfast here was the best we had in all Morocco. What wasn’t clear to us when planning our trip is that the hotel has two swimming pools – one at the hotel and another spectacular one set in a large garden property outside the city which we unfortunately left for our last day. We will highly recommend this hotel to any friends who are planning on coming to Marrakech.,Date of stay: October 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,New York,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flx67
La Maison Arabe,indigor wrote a review Dec 2009,40,Cookery class excellent day,Not much I can add to previous reviews very well organised and Prof Mohammed (a trip advisor local expert) was rea\lly knowledgeable about food and indeed Morroco. We paid 500DH eachwhich given it included the excellent lunch we were instructed how to prepare and an hour or so lounging by the lovely country club pool and transport was very fair value.for the half day. I did'nt stay at the hotel which looked pleasant and the Spanish people we went in the transport to the club rated highly enough to return 3 years in a row. I preferred the decor of our more central and much cheaper Riad  but I guess more European charms may suit some better certainly the rooms will have been light as they mostly overlooked the pool.

La Maison Arabe,carlsternheim wrote a review Dec 2009,10,Rip off... Something for nothing.,"I booked this hotel over the internet planning to spend a total of three days in Marrakech. However before my arrival when I was still in Tangier and three days out I became ill and needed to leave Morocco for home. I called the hotel to tell them I was canceling and was told that because of the late date of notification I would have to pay for one night. This seemed reasonable though November in Morocco is low season and everywhere I went there was availability. Regardless of my attempt at courtesy this hotel charged me for three nights citing their ""policy"" of nonrefundability seven day prior to arrival. I guess I understand this policy from a short-term business perspective. (If I have your money it doesn't matter if I provide a service.) Maybe this is the way business is done in Morocco but I find their crassness intolerable and will not be coming back to be ripped off again.",Date of stay: November 2009,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Vienna, Austria",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carlsternheim

La Maison Arabe,Rach1382 wrote a review Nov 2009,50,An absolute MUST- Five Star All The Way,"I just spent four nights at La Maison Arabe and had a truly wonderful experience. The hotel is situated in the heart of the Medina minutes from the central square mosque and souks. I travel a lot for work mostly staying at Four Seasons Mandarin Oriental and Ritz Carlton's and would MOST definitely recommend La Maison Arabe over any of the five star chains that are situated right outside of the Medina. You do truly get the five star experience as well as the added bonus of being right in the city.    The hotel grounds are immaculate and the staff make you feel at home immediately. The housekeepers are fantastic; they must have come in three times a day to meticulously clean our suite. Breakfast and tea everyday were superb; including the homemade yogurt which I yearn for every morning. The galettes are an added bonus. We did an afternoon cooking class which was definitely a highlight of the trip. Mohammed the instructor couldn't have been nicer. The braised lamb tagine with candied figs and walnuts was extraordinary as was the warm eggplant salad that we made to accompany it! The Spa is also very worthwhile. I had the ""Royal Hammam"" package that was unreal...my skin is still glistening.

We are so glad we listened to them! This place is unbelievable. We felt like we were staying at a luxurious private club yet with all the advantages and service of a very well run larger establishment. Our room and the hotel were beautifully decorated – we were told that everything was chosen by the owner (who it seems is an Italian aristocrat). The hotel has 2 pools: one located at the hotel in the city and another that one gets to by a shuttle. The country setting pool is spectacular and is where as it was quite hot when we were there we would spend every afternoon.

La Maison Arabe,Richard J wrote a review Oct 2009,50,Delightful,We stayed for five nights at this hotel rather more than a Riad. Reasonably situated in the Medina it is a very well appointed property which has recently been extended. When one contemplates what these improvements must have cost the tarrif is very fair but this is not an economy destination. We found everything about this place spot on (not usual for me -see my other reviews). Top class reception very friendly staff and trained to a level more commensurate to 5 stars than this moderately sized establishment.  I was surprised by the previous entry criticising lunch we were out for lunch but ate twice in the restaurant for dinner which was by any standards very good and stylish cooking. Actually the hot dessert souffle was really close to brilliant!  We had one session at the cookery school which was a bit expensive but properly organised and fun. This was held at their outlying centre in the Palmeraie with pleasant gardens and an attractive swimming pool.  You are probably getting the idea I really rate this place.

La Maison Arabe,Brucewcca wrote a review Jul 2009,50,The hotel and staff is terrific!,"The hotel lobby is beautifully decorated and situated in a way that makes you feel like you're home. The lobby/check-in staff members are friendly helpful and very efficient. The lobby is also small leaving more space for interesting furniture artifacts and art work throughout the hotel. Once we were quickly checked in we discovered something special and interesting around every corner of the hotel and up and down every staircase.    The hotel is small by some standards but spacious. You can easily ""get away from it all."" Aside from the guest rooms there are both outdoor and indoor semi private areas. In addition the bar/lounge area is large beautifully decorated and very comfortable. The friendly and fun staff there will make sure of it. The restaurant food is terrific and the staff is warm helpful and always smiling. Take advantage of the breakfast buffet. The buffet food is fresh and some items can be made to your specifications. If eating a very healthy breakfast is important then this alternative will work well for you.    One of the concerns we had during our trip (Spain and Marrakech) concerned noise outside the hotels since we had never stayed in any of them prior to this trip. At La Maison Arabe we were within an easy walk from the Souk and otherwise on a small but somewhat busy street. We never heard outside noise in our room. We stayed in a deluxe suite (there were three adults) and we were very comfortable. We had only a few special requests and the staff was happy and quick to assisst us.    The on-site pool and the surrounding area is very clean refreshing and relaxing. I used it several times. We also spent a few hours at the off-site pool. The drive to the site is short. Once you get there there is a 100 yard walk through a nicely landscapted area and then another surprise. More to see and do and terrific service. This was another comfortable place to relax play eat drink and socialize with other guests and staff. There was no pressure from anyone to do anything! (Including from my travel partner!)    We had never been to Africa prior to this visit. Our experience in large part due to the hotel and the staff was unexpected and pure delight. We intend to visit La Maison Arabe again soon.

The pool in the new addition is beautiful (it's rare to have a property in the medina with a decent size pool) but don't let that you dissuade you from taking a free shuttle out to the hotel's ""country club."" The country club has nothing to do with golf but rather is a country oasis with some of the most amazing gardens ever (rosemary hedges) and a lovely pool area and casbah.

Every afternoon after walking around Marrakesh all day the room service always brought us mint tea and local sweets to our terrace! it was the perfect way to finish our exhausting days!  the staff at the reception helped us with all our restaurant bookings and was always very helpful and polite.  be sure not to miss 2 things:  - the amazing food in the hotel's restaurant. seriously dont miss out on trying: the orange soup the lamb shoulder and the beef and tomato tajine. before marrakesh we spent 4 days travelling around morocco and we had our best meal in this hotel!!  - also the hotel has a second location outside the city. on our last day we got tired of shopping and walking around marrakesh so we went for a swim and lunch there. it is also the place where they have their cooking classes and their own vegetable garden.  i would definitely stay there again!!,Date of stay: April 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,greece,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caroline182
La Maison Arabe,emmachisit2009 wrote a review May 2009,50,A beautiful retreat in the centre of Marrakech,I booked this hotel through recommendations in a couple of guidebooks and didn't even think to check tripadvisor beforehand.    We arrived at 10am and were expecting to have to leave our bags until we could check in later. However the hotel was not very full and we were allowed to occupy our room immediately.    The room was absolutely one of the nicest I have ever stayed in and we were also given complimentary water wine and Morrocan treats - such as dates dried apricots and walnuts. The decor was beautiful and the room felt completely new.    We ended up spending the late afternoon relaxing on the terrace by the pool after tiring of haggling in the souks - what a welcome retreat! In the evening we ended up dining in the Moroccan restaurant and tried the chicken and almond pastilla which was very different and completely mouth watering (I feel hungry even writing about it!!) followed by tagine and chicken couscous all washed down with some Cuvee du President red wine - gorgeous. Oh by the way the chef gave me the recipes for the pastilla and tagine!    We had an evening flight the next day and were once again expecting to have our luggage locked away as per usual but the reception staff allowed us a very late checkout at 4pm.    We cannot find a single fault with this hotel - location is fantastic service is wonderful rooms are beautiful... bear in mind that I have seen plenty of ropey hotels through business and leisure travel and can usually find at least a couple of issues when I stay somewhere!    We have decided we would go back for a bit of a weekend retreat at some point and would recommend the hotel to anyone.

La Maison Arabe,FromSaoPaulo wrote a review Apr 2009,50,What a Lovely Place!!,We arrived at La Maison Arabe at 1 AM due to a flight delay. When getting into our room we noticed it had some problems. On the following day the manager promptly upgraded us to a brand new suite (room 240) without our asking and provided the packing and moving too!! It was just perfect!!! Bright airy and tastefully decorated with all the furniture covered in soft leather. From our terrace we had a view of the pool!! On the desk we had Moroccan wine (great!!) nuts dried fruit and a large bottle of mineral water.  The staff was incredibly polite cheerful and helpful.  The riad is lovely beautifully decorated with antique Moroccan crafts full of character. Every little corner had a sitting area with lovely sofas and always a small fountain. The pool area is large and housekeeping was constantly cleaning and maintaining it.  The localization is just perfect as you could easily walk to the Koutoubia and the Djemaa el Fna Square with the colorful bazaars and souks.  We were so pleased we chose this boutique hotel to stay at in Marrakech. If we had stayed at a one of the large chain hotels we would have had to depend on taxis.  We surely will recommend this place to all our friends who intend travelling to Marrakech!!!!,Date of stay: April 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Miami, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FromSaoPaulo
La Maison Arabe,DeniseLaw wrote a review Apr 2009,50,"La Maison Arabe, The Charming Delight","Our trip to Marrakesh was absolutely wonderful! Our experience at La Maison Arabe was first class all the way. LMA is located inside the Medina walls about three city blocks from the Souk. Upon arriving I was a little surprised at the lack of a fancy entrance off the street. The entrance was midway between two streets down a cobblestone alley too small for a car. Our tour guide (from Olive Branch Tours whom we grew very fond of) was quick to point out that this is part of the magic of Marrakech you never know what lies behind the walls. The second we walked into LMA we knew we had found a hidden treasure. The people were warm and sophisticated. The furnishings of the hotel are beautiful including berber and persian rugs throughout antiques interesting ceramics and pottery old baskets and original fine art. LMA is decorated with exquisite taste to the Moroccan style and culture. There were also several darling outside courtyards complete with trickling fountains flowering vines chirping birds and butterflies. LMA has a wonderful heated pool that is large enought to swim laps. Spa services are available and I hear the massuese there is great. Free Internet and Wifi access that worked well.    I have to mention the staff at LMA. There are at least 50 employees working at all times. This is a very good guest to staff ratio unlike some of the newer Riads in Marrakech. Check this out as I heard some scary stories from some other travelers about their Riads. Some of the Riads have 3 - 5 employees that all leave after breakfast is over. At LMA everything you needed was at your fingertips within minutes presented with a genuine smile. The front desk staff was helpful knowledgable courteous and available for recommendations directions or just a friendly hello.    LMA has two restaurants and a lounge. One restaurant offered only Morrocan for fine dining and the other offered French Thai and Moroccan. People came from hotels all around Marrakech to dine here as the food wine list and service were so good. In the evenings each dining room had live musicians that just capped off the atmosphere. The Tangine Lamb L'Orange was delicious. The souflees melted in your mouth. Prices were reasonable.    Regarding our room; we had a small suite that was perfect for our family of three. The main area of the room had the master bed (mattresses were fine) spacious bath two large closets and a TV. The sitting room was complete with a couch fireplace writing desk and a single bed perfect for a third person child or adult. Everyone had privacy and we were very comfortable and made ourselves right at home.    I went to the cooking school which was located at the LMA Country Club about 20 minutes away from the main hotel. The instructor spoke French English and Arabic so there were no communication problems. We made Chicken Tagine and then sat down together and enjoyed lunch by the pool. The Country Club was very nice and could accomodate large groups. There was a great vegatable and flower garden ponds with frogs turtles and fish palm trees a restaurant and a large pool with showers. One of the other students described LMA as ""palacial"" and was very tempted to move there from her western hotel in new part of Marrakesh. The pictures of LMA on the website do not do it justice the hotel is much nicer.    Our stay at La Maison Arabe was fabulous; a perfect 5 on the Tripadvisor scale. My husband and I cannot fathom why it is listed as #51 and not in the top 10 if not #1. I highly recommend LMA to anyone desiring a taste of the true Moroccan culture and the comforts of a 5 star hotel. One last recommendation would be to hire a guide it was well worth it.

La Maison Arabe,fromheretoeverywhere wrote a review Jan 2009,50,Outstanding service and beautiful hotel,We did not actually stay at La Maison Arabe. We were staying nearby and booked a cooking class through La Maison Arabe. The class was great held offsite at a great resort location. We met someone who was staying at LMA at the cooking class and she recommended the spa there. We arrived at the hotel a half hour before our spa appointment time and had not had lunch. Starving we asked if there was somewhere in the hotel to get a snack. We were whisked off to the restaurant a beautiful table was laid and we were brought a delicious club sandwich we ordered off the room service menu as they were between lunch and dinner service. All in time to make our appointment. The spa is an amazing experience also so relaxing and restorative after a dusty day of shopping. We stayed to meet our new friend in the bar and ended up staying for a light dinner in the bar.

We came across the hotel by accident and ended up eating there 6 times during a one week stay. The hotel is wonderfully decorated and the staff are imaculately turned out very friendly and helpful.    The Moroccan restaurant was excellent with plenty of choice on the set three course menu. We also ate in the International which was having some staff problems. The Director of the hotel was very apologetic and gave us free water wine and cognacs. More than enough compensation but on seeing us again the next evening gave us a round of drinks in the bar. This was not necessary but left a warm feeling with us all.

La Maison Arabe,Windsor_Wool wrote a review Oct 2008,50,An oasis in Marrakech,This is a wonderful peaceful hotel tucked away from the hustle of Marrakech. Centrally located you can head out to Djemaa or the souks easily or simply choose to relax and unwind in the hotel.    The 'Country Club' which contains pool gardens and restaurant is a real treat - much nicer than the website pics suggest. It is a 20 min shuttle away (probably the only slight negative to this hotel) but it is well worth an afternoon there.

La Maison Arabe,amcgoldie wrote a review Aug 2008,50,Loved our time,I went to Marrakech with a girlfriend and we originally planned to stay in Riad we had booked online.  We arrived on a Monday night to our Riad quite late and it was horrible. We droppe dour bags and walked around the Medina stopping in at La Maison Arabe for dinner. On our way in we asked if there were any rooms available and the concierge said they had a room for 200 Euros. We are students and I immediatley said 200 Euros was too much at which point he countered with 100 Euros a night. He explained that the room was normally 400 Euros but that it was low season and they were trying to fill the hotel.  They showed us the Aladdin room which we were thrilled about. We put a deposit down of 100 Euros to hold the room and we returned the next morning.  The hotel had free internet on a communal computer which was perfectly doable.  The room we got the Aladdin room was great. It was big- it had two twin beds pushed together that formed one bed it had a sitting area with two chairs and a table that had a bottle of red Moroccan wine and a basket of snacks (dried fruit and nuts). It also had a small balcony with an umbrella and two sofa chairs. The bathroom was big with two sinks and a bath/shower and toilet/bidet.  The room was quite clean- We certainly had no complaints after where we had booked the night before. There was satellite TV which was OK- kinda wierd channels from different countries.  Included in the room rate was breakfast and afternoon tea- both of which were DELICIOUS. Breakfast was some croissants and pastries with homemade jam fresh OJ house made yogurt mint tea or coffee and Moroccan pancake type things.  Afternoon tea was mint tea with a plate of little cookies- a perfect afternoon pick me up.  We ate dinner in the hotel one night- it was very expensive but quite delicious. And really nice to not have to leave the hotel. We did not do the cooking class- it seemed like a lot of money.  We ate really well at other restaurants for a lot less though.  WE did do the Hammam in the hotel which was not very good. It seemed expensive for a lot of lying down and just being rubbed- which we could have done ourselves. Upon check out we mentioned our disappointment and the staff was super nice and took the tip off the bill.  We did try and do some things- like camel rides- through our hotel but we felt that in many instances teh staff had deals going with certain tour guides that would make it cost more etc. so we ended up doing most things on our own. However they did try their best to help us.  The room was tidied twice a day and the staff was incredibly helpful especially in the evenings always trying to accomodate our requests.  I woudl definitely go back to this hotel especially for its location. It is a 5 minute walk from the Djemma El Fnaa and the souks. We walked ALL over and found this to be a great location. It is far from the Nouvelle Ville but to be honest we felt there was not a whole lot going on there (beyond Ex-pats psuedo partying) that we wanted to be involved in. WE much preferred the authenticity of the Medina and we felt it was a great respite to be able to walk out of the bustle straight to our hotel. There was some construction going on next to the hotel but it was not disruptive.  Also be sure to do a caleche ride around the Medina at night when it has cooled down.

La Maison Arabe,emiana wrote a review Mar 2008,50,A Wonderful Oasis,We spent four nights at the Maison Arabe and loved every minute of it. The property is hidden away and it is a jewel. It is beautifully decorated and restored. It is located just a few minutes walk from the main square.    Our room was spacious and comfortable and gave onto a lovely terrace in the middle of which was a beautiful small marble fountain (typical in riads). I loved the bathroom with its vaulted ceilings and blue and yellow tiles.    The service was impeccable friendly and superbly helpful. We also had a hammam treatment. I had the royal treatment which was nice but I wouldn't do it again - it just wasn't worth the extra cash because all they do is smear you with extra goo. Next time I would just have the hammam treatment the scrub down and the relaxing massage.    The food at the hotel was absolutely delicious -- it's the best in town. The Moroccan pancackes prepared fresh in front of you for breakfast were scrumptious and we'll miss them - make sure you try the mixed cheese and vegetable ones. So good. Their mint tea is also the best we had during our sojourn. We also had lunch and dinner there and they were both fantastic.    Only thing - be prepared to hear the call of the muezzin very early in the morning but I think that would be the case wherever one stays in town.,Date of stay: March 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emiana

La Maison Arabe,SummerCouple wrote a review Jan 2008,30,Not Worth the Price,We have stayed in both a Deluxe Room (2000 to 2.500 DHS) and a Junior Suite (3500 to 4000 DHS). Both of the rooms were disappointingly small especially for the price paid. The bed in our Junior Suite was actually two double beds pushed together so not very comfortable because neither one of us wanted to lay on the dividing line part.    The rooms were clean (and surprisingly small) and they do a good job tending to the rooms on a regular basis including turning the sheets at night. In other words La Maison Arabe is really a hotel.    The meals were also well prepared and service of high quality. Nice wait staff.    The receptionists and managers however are not completely service focused. Their quotes for guides and taxis vary from time to time which is disturbing given that it is a hotel and all of the drivers they use are probably friends or relatives. Instead of focusing on the business of making money whether for the hotel or themselves they should focus on satisfying the customers which is actually the key to making more money. Anyway we didn't really find anyone in the front desk to be overly genuine.    During our travels in Morocco I can safely say without any hesitation that Riad Kniza (in Marrakech and truly a Riad though the dinners there are not great) and La Maison Bleue (Fez) are significantly nicer than La Maison Arabe and also for less the price. In other words this neutral rating/average is relative to other options in Marrakech and not an absolute rating for this hotel. If the room rates were reduced by half they may be worth it.,Date of stay: January 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SummerCouple

La Maison Arabe,2BAnonymous wrote a review Dec 2007,40,"Hate to Say It, But Was Slightly Disappointed","First let me put a caveat on the title... We had just come from a marvelous dar in Fez (Dar Seffarine) so we were open to be biased against a more-hotel-than-dar-or-riad. I think La Maison Arabe then is a partial victim of circumstance. But just partially.    The walk up to the property is lovely - down a side street moving away from the hecticness that is Marrakech. We were received by the front desk and quickly checked in. My only complaint would be our confirmed reservation for a cooking class the next day was not on their calendar. However this was easily rectified. (Side note: I strongly recommend the cooking course available through La Maison Arabe. See separate reviews.)    Our room ""Soulayman"" was fine but seemed a bit of a let down from the expectations set by the photos on the website. It just did not seem as charming in person. The decor felt more like a standard hotel with a few very subtle Moroccan touches to it. And at MAD 2'200 per night (roughly EUR 195) I felt a bit soaked. I regretted having opted for the junior room and wished I had saved the few extra dirham and just booked a standard room. Or instead booked a riad or a dar to exploit an opportunity unique to Morocco rather than staying in a room that felt like ""just another hotel"".    But where La Maison Arabe begins to separate itself from a dar or riad is the size of the property. Given that it was created from several adjoining houses there are many nooks and crannies to explore - or to sit and have a drink. The buildings are beautifully maintained. The inner courtyard is peaceful and lovely. But you could of course take advantage of these whether or not you were a paid guest. Score another one for staying somewhere else.    The one unique element that would be open only to guests (or attendants of the cooking course) is access to their offsite property via a free shuttle to and from La Maison. It is simply gorgeous. The gardens are beautifully maintained the pool (although untested by us) looked like a lovely place to quietly waste away the hours on a hot Moroccan day. Full bar service and limited meals are available.    Breakfasts were nice and offered a selection of breads pastries fresh yogurt and local delicacies. And if you wanted to completely cop out they even had several cereals on offer. All in all a good offering.    We ate at their Moroccan restaurant (there is an international menu on offer at their other) and like the property itself found it be a little overpriced. The atmosphere was great the food and service were fine but the price paid of MAD 400 per person for a three-course meal (not including beverages) just seemed high given that the quality and composition of the menu was just not that distinctive.    So to tie this all up I would say that there is nothing wrong with La Maison Arabe. Far from it. I just don't think that it is the best experience for Marrakech and certainly not one worth the price paid. For that I can only score the property as 4 out of 5.",Date of stay: December 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Dallas, Texas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2BAnonymous

The hotel was built from several joined buildings and has some fantastic public spaces a cozy bar a beautiful outdoor courtyard perfect for breakfast and lovely smaller courtyards and patios.

We felt comfortable walking around the hotel late at night and unlike some of the other hotels in the Medina this one is accessible by car so you don't have to carry your luggage by hand.

However be very careful to specify exactly what you want for your accomodations. All the rooms are different and are in three connected buildings. My husband and I were traveling with our two sons and a very close single friend. The hotel knew this. Unfortunately when we arrived after a long drive through the Atlas mountains for a four night stay we found our sons in a room on the top floor of one building we were in a room on the top floor of another building and our friend was in the third building. They knew we were traveling with children but they separated us. Also we were supposed to have a suite and there was not one available. There was not much they could do until two nights later due to our arrival on a weekend. We were very unhappy especially as one son was ill. Also I think Americans will much prefer suites if they stay in this hotel as the rooms can be quite small. I recommend that if you choose to stay here that you invest in a telephone call and get very specific about rooms when making your reservation. There is no pool at the property however there is a truly beautiful villa and pool owned by the hotel which provides scheduled transport.,Date of stay: June 2007,Trip type: Traveled with family,New York City,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wvnyc

If you stay in a hotel you will miss out on the charm of Morocco. Furthermore if you want excellent service in a beautiful setting stay at La Maison Arabe.    The staff is so warm and friendly constantly seeing to your needs whether it be mint tea breakfast or a restaurant recommendation. You will want for nothing.    The rooms are all unique filled with Moroccan treasures textiles and flowers. The pool is 15 minutes away but do not be alarmed it is an enchanting garden right outside of the Medina--they operate their own complimentary shuttle back and forth.

We stayed at another riad in a residential neighborhood that was in a more peaceful area but easy to get lost; and getting lost in the medina is not a fun experience when you are ready to get back to your hotel. Its about a 8 min walk to the Fna of which you dont want to stay in the craziness of the Fna. The beds were our most comfortable in morocco so far; out of 3 hotels. We stayed at all 5 star properties but it seems as if hard mattresses are preferred here. If you like soft; this is a good option. This hotel has more of a hotel feel to a riad feel to it. I think in morocco; its best to stay in at least 1 riad. There are also more rooms here than a small riad where you may not see other guests very often. At night this hotel is much more charming than when we arrived during the day. I recommend this hotel to older guests since its not a happening place or very hip. There is always someone here that speaks english which is less common at the smaller riads which simplifies the planning process if you dont speak French. Hotel has wifi but it doesnt work in most rooms so you must take your computer to the common areas. An advantage of staying here is that all taxi drivers should know of this hotel.,Date of stay: June 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Newport Beach, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelSnob1
La Maison Arabe,wfritz wrote a review Jun 2007,50,My favorite hotle in the world,My parner and I stayed here in 2001 during renovations of La Mamounia and it was the best decision we've ever made in booking a hotel room (we will never go back to La Mamounia again). We enjoyed our stay so much we went back last summer with the entire family. I lived in Morocco during the late 1980's and if you had only one hotel to stay in Morocco this hotel is the very best the country has to offer. The rooms are beautiful and spotless--with the smell of dry cyprus wood and roses. The staff is knowledgable and helpful.

La Maison Arabe,Ilovemyhols wrote a review Feb 2007,50,Excellent riad,"We have just spent 3 nights at the Maison Arabe. The hotel was excellent. Our room was lovely and well presented. The hotel itself was beautifully furnished and the staff very welcoming.  After busy days out exploring Marrakesh the hotel was a welcome retreat from all the hustle and bustle outside.  We enjoyed drinks in the bar and in the little courtyards around the hotel. The food was v good in the Morroccan restaurant but if you are ""tangined"" and ""cous coused"" out the food in the bar is good too.  It is about a 10min walk to the main square and easy to pick up taxis if you are going further. My husband enjoyed the massage in hotels hamman.

La Maison Arabe,Tracy P wrote a review Jan 2007,50,Absolutely Fabulous,We stayed at this beautiful riad for four nights in November and can't recommend it enough to anyone who is contemplating visiting Marrakech. It was our first visit to Morocco so we were a little dubious as to what one should expect but we were very pleasantly surprised when we stepped through the door into what one would describe as a tranquil oasis beautifully appointed throughout and greeted by staff who were very welcoming their English was perfect and they could not do enough for you. Our first night was spent in the Dalila which had a lovely long private balcony overlooking a small courtyard and the remainder of the stay was spent in the Chehrayar which again had its own private terrace. Breakfast was served either in the open courtyard or within one of the lavishly decorated rooms off and evening drinks were served either under the stars in the courtyard or in a very luxurious Club Bar which was run by a very knowledgable and good humoured head barman who had a wicked sense of humour and concocted the most wonderful and lethal cocktail for me so scrummy that I just had to indulge in another! We ate at a couple of highly regarded restaurants in Marrakech a couple of evenings which were excellent but our last night was spent at La Maison Arabe and what a splendid way to end our stay there. The ambience of the restaurant with its roaring fire crackling away in the grate combined with the musician and probably the best tajine I had tasted Lemon Tart to die for and a rather nice bottle of Moroccan wine made us wish we had eaten in the restaurant more. Last but not least the manager Nabila was the perfect host along with the rest of the staff and we really were quite sad to leave but I have been promised by my husband that he will be taking me back and I shall be holding him to that promise!,Date of stay: November 2006,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Crowborough, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Malaysia4ever
La Maison Arabe,Gypsy-TX wrote a review Dec 2006,50,Beautiful Riad,My husband and I stayed at the La Maison Arabe for 6 nights. The hotel is beautifully furnished with a mixture of European chic and Moroccon-inspired architecture and furnishings. Fresh flowers were in abundance everywhere and every niche had some beautiful object to delight you. The staff was very attentive and accommodating. We took the 3 day cooking course which we enjoyed. A bit of trepidation as my husband does not cook but with the English interpreter Mohammed (who was terrific-highly recommend him) the dada chef and the assistant you couldn't go wrong. We got to eat these delicious creations by the gorgeous pool under palm and olive trees with more attentive friendly staff. Great way to learn about Morocco (Mohammed was a great source of information) and Moroccan cuisine.

All the public areas are beautiful decorated and appointed with a unique sense of style. All were warm friendly inviting and comfortable.  The food was excellent both at breakfast and in their beautiful dining room and bar area.  The staff was truly OUTSTANDING and catered to our every need. They couldn't do enough for us but were pleasantly around when you needed them. How refreshing. The rooms are precious. All a bit different but all equally as lovely and well appointed. Everything you could want and more. I felt like it was a ""home"" with an atmosphere of true hospitality in every sense of the word. We are in the hotel business and have stayed at hundreds of places throughout the world. This I can rate as one of the top  small friendly and totally service orientated hotel I've ever stayed at. Look forward to my next visit.  Also the staff from the waiters to the management cannot help you enough. They do NOT miss a single detail and are a wealth of information. They all speak English (and so many other languages) it was truly a fantastic experience. Don't miss this place! If you can't get a room then you must go there for a romantic dinner or just sit at the beautiful bar and enjoy their live music.

La Maison Arabe,Lawyer/Exporter wrote a review Dec 2006,40,go for the cooking courses,My husband and I stayed at the hotel because we wanted to do the cooking course for 3 days. It was held in a lovely kitchen at the pool/ garden oasis owned by the hotel and about 10 mins. away. We made superb Moroccan dishes in the mornings and then were served them at the pool for lunch. We then swam/snoozed and returned to the hotel at about 3.30 to explore the medina in the cooler part of the day.The hotel was superb and the jazz bar with its pianist/singer and light menu was gorgeous. We had a lovely suite and I although the decor in the rooms is a little odd it is comfy and homely. I love the 5am call to prayer which adds to the whole Moroccan experience. The only complaint I have is that the welcome on arrival was not very warm or efficient. Most hotels in such hot areas offer tea and a chair during check in.

La Maison Arabe,Stephen R wrote a review Nov 2006,40,Comfortable Ryad in a Busy City,We spent 4 nights of our recent honeymoon at La Maison Arabe in Marrakesh. We arrived late in the evening at the Marrakesh airport but the riad arranged for our pick up (the driver was waiting with a sign - cost was about $15).    The riad is located inside the Marrakesh medina and offers some comforts of a larger more traditional hotel. We had TV and mini-bar in the room and as there is common computer near the lobby for free Internet access. The rooms in the Riad were very nice and a bit more hip than the average riad in other cities like Fes and Meknes. Room service is available should you request it. We slept very soundly however you may wish to sleep with the air conditioner on a high setting as there is a mosque very close to the riad and the call to prayer in the morning (during early November it was at approximately 5am) sounds like it’s going on right outside your room.    There are two restaurants in the riad one offering traditional Moroccan food and the other offers an Asian themed international cuisine. Breakfast is offered each morning (and is included in the room price) in the riad’s courtyard. Be sure to try the fresh omelets they are excellent!! For dinner the food at the international restaurant left a little to be desired and we found several of the dishes to be quite salty. The service was adequate but the restaurant’s atmosphere made up for it --- it is a dimly lit “Moroccan jazz lounge” complete with plush couches a jazz pianist and a lengthy cocktail menu which are all welcome treats after a long day exploring Marrakesh. .    One word of warning if you choose to explore the city on foot (without a guide)... Be wary of people approaching you as you leave the riad offering to walk you to souks or other tourist destinations. We were approached by someone claiming to work at the riad who led us away from where we sought out to go and only after protest and a few Dirham he left us alone. In retrospect learning this lesson at a cost of only a few dollars was probably a good thing as there are lots of chances to get taken for a ride in a tourist friendly city like Marrakech.,Date of stay: October 2006,,NYC,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Frigga212
La Maison Arabe,Rouby Lou wrote a review Nov 2006,50,Luxurious and calm hotel,Stay at La Maison Arabe if you want to be in luxurious tranquille surroundings allowing you to forget the hustle and bustle of Marrakech (you won't want to leave the hotel!). A wonderful find which you will not be able to fault (we will return one day). We had a lovely 2 night visit which meant we ended our stay in Morocco in style and comfort. Lovely breakfast and dinner was excellent too. Fabulous bar - go for a cocktail even if you aren't staying there. Book it you'll love it. If you want to go to the pool it is a 15 mins journey in their complementary minibus - the pool is lovely (also where they do the cookery classes) and even the journey there is interesting.,Date of stay: October 2006,,"Oxford, England",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoubyLou
La Maison Arabe,jvparis wrote a review Nov 2006,50,An absolute gem !,"My wife and I have been several times to Morocco and La Maison Arabe is by far the best hotel we've stayed in.  It is an absolute gem decorated in a tasteful mix of Moroccan and European styles. Our very comfortable room (""Nour"") had 2 private terraces.  The beautiful swimming pool and gardens are not adjacent to the hotel -- one takes the hotel's shuttle service to get there (it took around 15 minutes). We thought in advance that this might be a ""negative"" but in fact were delighted to have such a paradise at our disposal -- away from the hustle and bustle of the medina where the hotel is located.  The staff at La Maison Arabe was discreet yet attentive and could not have been friendlier. I met the hotel manager who told me they have a staff of 65 people (for a 17 room hotel) which might explain the top-notch level of service we experienced.  The hotel has a stunning 1930's-style piano bar where we would have drinks every evening. We ate once at the hotel's excellent Moroccan restaurant. The musicians there were incredible so much so that we purchased their CD.  If you are looking for a charming and romantic hotel in Marrakech I can recommend La Maison Arabe without hesitation.

La Maison Arabe,Vuittonsofstyle wrote a review Oct 2006,10,Why is this dump so famous?,Why is this awful hotel so famous? Surely not just because Andrew Harper recommends it? I booked direct getting a 10% Q-Club discount from Andrtew Harper Hideaway Report. I could not believe how awful this hotel was!! Those of you who rave about it must never have stayed anywhere else.  The carpets on the stairs were loose so we had to be really careful. The carpet in our suite was threadbare and dangerous - we both tripped up every time we walked past. The furnishings were tired and dated. The bathroom was so tiny that only one person could get in there and the shower flooded it every time I turned it on. The food in the restaurants was terrible compared to what you can get in Marrakech.

Reception staff were very welcoming and bar staff really friendly and knowledgable.    The Moroccan restaurant was well served and offered a delicious range of traditional meals - accompanied by the amazing musicians - Khalid & Khalid. With the scent of cinnamon in the air and their passionate gypsy guitar pervading our senses they were meals we will never forget!    We took a cookery course in Palmeria arranged by the hotel which was excellent - the two Mohammeds provided a good morning's teaching and cooking!    Our suite (Nour) was impeccably maintained very comfortable and beautifully decorated.    I highly commend La Maison Arabe to you and will definitely be returning!

La Maison Arabe,.-. wrote a review Sep 2006,50,Superb Service - What a Party !,I have just spent a fabulous weekend staying with friends and family at La Maison Arabe. The hotel was superb.    The decor / ambiance were excellent full of character often missing in larger hotels. Each of the rooms was different each well decorated spacious and comfortable.    The food in the restaurant was excellent the bar well stocked and varied.    It was the service however that differentiated La Maison Arabe - they could not have been better. The staff were pro-active friendly and took care of our every need. They kindly arranged a whole host of activities for my friends and family ranging from city guides to the most spectacular party in their Kiad by the pool. The staff clearly bent over backwards to make our stay comfortable and memorable. I could not praise their efforts higher.

La Maison Arabe,Frqnt-trvller wrote a review Aug 2006,50,Fantastic hotel in good location,We just came back from a 4-day trip to Marrakesh. The hotel is located in the Medina and only a 10-15 minute walk to the main square (Fnaa) and the souks. We were able to walk to all the main sites by foot.    The hotel itself is lovely and finished to a high standard. We stayed in a suite and a luxury double room (we were 6 girls all with high standards) and were not disappointed. What a relief to return to the hotel after a hot and dusty day of sight-seeing in the city! The rooms and bathrooms were luxurious spacious and clean and the beds were comfortable. The toileteries on offer were not exceptional but sufficient.    Breakfast was included and consisted mainly of breads coffee orange juice (freshly squeezed) and yoghurt (which was delicious). Our only complaint was that they could have served some fresh fruit.    The spa was very small and only had 2 therapists. However both were friendly and competent. We were a little disappointed with the hammam treatments but the facials made up for that.    One warning though - the pool is a 20-min drive from the hotel. This was not a problem for us but may be an issue for those who want the convenience of having a pool located at the hotel.    The staff were very polite courteous and helpful. I would definitely stay in this hotel again and recommend it to others.,Date of stay: August 2006,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, England",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Frqnt-trvller

We travelled by train from Fes during which we all ate very little arriving at La Maison Arabe for supper. My husband spent the night and next day with an upset stomach. And yes he did have the fish pastille whereas we didn't. He lost out on a whole day of our holiday staying at the Riad with the immodium (which we'd brought).

La Maison Arabe,peterarmitage wrote a review Feb 2006,30,"Lovely Riad, but ...",I share the view of many of those who have written reviews about La Maison Arabe - it is an exceptional hotel for Morroco in particular (and see my review for Riads in Meknes if you'd like to know how bad they can be!)  Both the public areas and our room were exceptional. The level of design and finish was quiet remarkable. The weather was terrible - cold and wet but the hotel was kept at a very good temperature. Definitely 5 star accommodation and worth the high price. However. . . . .  We ate dinner in the (main) Morocan restaurant. I had fish and at 4am the next morning I got very ill with diarrhoea definitely from the food we ate in their restauarant since we'd had nothing to eat since mid-day of the day before I got ill. Suspect it was the fish 'pastille'. The hotel management were to give them their due very concerned and responsive - they organised and paid for a doctor who prescribed an antibiotic and Imodium - once again the hotel management arranged to collect the medicines from a local pharmacy. They also waived the entire meal cost and charged us for the room only - I would have much preferred to not get sick however. The manager was unable to say what was the origin of the fish or when it was bought because we decided to cut short our stay and left before the chef arrived for the day. All in all a great disappointment given our high expectations from reading other reviews before we made the reservation. I think that the message is that anywhere in N. Africa hygiene can be a problem so go prepared with your own anti-diarrhoea drugs. If you get 'the runs' drink bottled water only (no solids / food) for 24 hours. If it persists after 24 hours then see a doctor.,Date of stay: February 2006,,"Houston, Texas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterarmitage
