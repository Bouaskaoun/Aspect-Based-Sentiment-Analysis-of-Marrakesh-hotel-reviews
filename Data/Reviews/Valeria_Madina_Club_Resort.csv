Valeria Madina Club Resort,Hycie B wrote a review Mar 7,50,Fabulous Holiday!,I extended my stay because I was having such a lovely time!  The food was nice and varied if you needed it piping hot there was a microwave to use but I didn't use it. Rooms were big and clean I loved the Riad style.    What is outstanding here is the amazing staff; Their friendliness helpfulness genuine concern - I was delighted with their treatment of us.  I have to give special mention to some I got to know:-  BAHIJA and her Manager MOHAMMED were brilliant at front desk.  YAHYA is absolutely BRILLIANT on guest services SO helpful with great English.  ABDEL and MAMODO from the Entertainment Team were so hardworking &  inclusive making sure to translate French to English and bringing us into any  activity. Watch out for Abdel's fabulous dancing and Mamado's sharp dressing!  JULIUS & MOMO from entertainment were lovely and friendly (good English too)  ABDEL the photographer takes excellent photos get some while you're there.  Lastly BRAHIM in the dining room is the warmest friendliest man ever! SO NICE.    Guys if you have any problem while there don't come home and put it in a review - talk to the staff and believe me they will do EVERYTHING in their power to improve the situation they are decent hardworking people and this hotel is the place to go for a fun and fabulous holiday (or relaxing as there's a quiet area too)!,Date of stay: February 2023,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hycieb

Valeria Madina Club Resort,Zahid wrote a review Mar 2,50,"Amazing resort, amazing service.",Came here with my family for the week and was absolutely amazing. The thing that stood out to me was the service from the staff. Especially Yahia. He was amazing. He always made sure he was available for any enquiries and always made us feel like we were at home. He kept my teen kids very happy by always joking with them when he‚Äôd see them and making them laugh. Yahia made sure they never got bored at the resort all the way from midday until midnight. Will definitely suggest this resort for everyone especially due to the service of people like Yahia who make your trip 10 times better! One thing they can improve on is a better selection of food maybe a day where they serve Indo-Chinese food.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZNiaz70
Valeria Madina Club Resort,Muhammad Niaz wrote a review Mar 2,50,"Amazing resort, amazing service.",Stayed here for a week with family and was amazing. We enjoyed how there is always something to do at the resort and you can never get bored. From the constant food to the activities around the resort from midday all the way till midnight. The service was amazing especially Yahia‚Äôs service. He was amazing and made us feel like we were at home. Yahia conversated with us in perfect English and made sure we always felt comfortable. He kept us busy during the days made us laugh and made sure we were always having fun. Yahia also helped us with what excursions to do around Marrakesh and entertained us all day even through till night time until we‚Äôd go back to our rooms and sleep. Definitely suggest this resort to families as their service and facilities are the best you can get. Ounahi was also a very big help and entertainer.

Valeria Madina Club Resort,travelbug19692017 wrote a review Jan 2023,40,Oasis in Marrakech,This is a one-stop place for you to explore and enjoy Moroccan culture.    What we like:  1. Staff are professional and showed genuine interest to make us feel welcomed and comfortable. Cheers to Yahia for looking after us and Latiffa for being flexible to accommodate our routines üõå.  2. There is excellent variety of food with distinctive Moroccan identity.  3. Day trips and transport can be arranged in advance within the hotel. This makes it safe and accessible. Thanks to Ihmad for accommodating our requests for selfies.  4. The facility is complete to keep you entertained if you just decide to stay in the resort. One lobby has its distinctive Moroccan architecture.  5. Evening theatre performances highlighting Moroccan culture.  6. ATM machine at the lobby for you to get cash as most shops during your day trips don‚Äôt have contactless card transactions.    What we don‚Äôt like:  1. The toilet is separate from the shower and has no wash basin. We don‚Äôt know the hygienic idea ü§î behind the design.  2. The dining hall has resident sparrows that descend to peck on the desserts üçÆ that‚Äôs eventually eaten by the guest.    Verdict;  Very good and would have been excellent if not to poorly designed toilet and shower and resident sparrows in the dining hall. Highly recommended; value for money homey complete facilities and of distinctive Moroccan character.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Stevenage, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelbug19692017
Valeria Madina Club Resort,Ilyas S wrote a review Jan 2023,50,Overall a Great Stay!,Overall we had a wonderful stay at the resort.    Room - The room was of a good size and tidy with daily cleaning and changing of towels.  Hotel Guide - Yahya was our English speaking hotel guide. He is as the resort for most of the day and is always happy to help whenever needed.  Food - All 3 daily meals included; Breakfast is generally the same. However lunch and dinner offer a different variety of foods daily. Tasty üòã.  Activities - The resort has 3 swimming pools football pitch tennis court gym theater and many more attractions to keep you busy.  Location - The hotel is about 25 minutes from the centre of Marrakech and offers a bus shuttle service for ¬£2 each way.

Valeria Madina Club Resort,John wrote a review Jan 2023,20,Dissapointed,Rooms were not allocated at the arrival. We had to wait till they provide the rooms. Ended up getting a room at the far end of the hotel which was a bit of a distance to walk from reception and all the activities. The room gave no internet no pillows toilet lights didn't work even it was informed to the reception and few other staff but attention was not given until late evening no pillow cover no extra pillows. telephones didn't work. Had to make many visits to the reception to inform about all the isues and get it rectified and smoke alarm was broken and faulty. We changed into a different room with similar problems and by the end we changed rooms 4 times. wifi /internet still not available in the any of the rooms.    Choice of food was not adequate except for new year's eve - similar food was being served every day. Big bottles of water and wine were given to the tables where most is wasted. Wastet of water for a country at risk of water shortage. Instead they should water stations around the site.    Activities and shows were only based for the french-speaking people and many staff couldn't speak english.    When the hotel occupancy was low the pool's heating system was switched off. Its very inconvenient to use the cold water pool. Coincidentally a staff member even accepted that they may have switched off the system in order to save money .    Overall the stay was not its value for its money... the hotel must be improved to attract any guests at all but in the meanwhile this is not the place to go for an enjoyable stay.,Date of stay: December 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kokiladon

Valeria Madina Club Resort,Du2 wrote a review Dec 2022,40,"Great place, shame about the food.",Had a fantastic time here for my nephew's 21st birthday. A group of 6 of us a combination of teens and parents came here for the weekend. This place was amazing. Marrakech is amazing and the hotel just topped it off. Super clean peaceful and wonderful amenities. Drinks were excellent and the staff couldn't so enough for us. The rooms are large clean and extremely comfortable. With a choice of 3 swimming pools a spa night club. Movie theatre as well as wonderful entertainment we never got bored. The place is huge and just has something for everyone. Every member of staff was polite courteous and went out of their way to ensure that we were happy. Despite the language barrier as most staff members spoke French everyone made an effort. We were actually assigned an English speaking staff member for the duration if our stay. The only downside for us was the food. Fantastic variety but not of a very good standard. It definitely did not match the settings. It was mostly like warm and at times literally tasteless. Even the chefs were borderline rude and catered to themsleves before serving us. If the owners sort out their catering then this place would be 5 star.,Date of stay: November 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dunomonde
Valeria Madina Club Resort,Nathanbracewell wrote a review Nov 2022,10,Avoid,Just got back from here and can‚Äôt say I was impressed.    To start with you should be aware there are 2 hotels here on the same complex and both ‚ÄúValeria‚Äù hotels and the service is completely different. We stayed at the medina. The catering staff are amazing and so is the famous Yaya who is the rep for the English at the hotel.    The food is ok but breakfast is poor with no warm options unless you want a boiled egg and a potato or a pancake. The bar service however let the whole hotel down.    Firstly you are allowed certain drinks from one bar but not another for example vodka whiskey etc is free from the snack bar but not the main bar? No sense.    Then there is the actual staff at the bar‚Ä¶. Oh my‚Ä¶. At several points the snack bar ran out of certain drinks and rather than getting more from the other bar that was it. No more of that drink for the day.    It‚Äôs like they have 1 bottle of vodka a day and once it goes tough luck. No common sense to go get more we get told to go the main bar instead. We go to the main bar and because they have no paper cups and we‚Äôre sat at the pool they can‚Äôt serve us. Either take some more beer to the snack bar or go get some more cups from the snack bar.    If you are not French this is not the hotel for you. Not because of a language barrier or anything as trivial as that is to be expected but because you are treated completely different.    On more than one occasion we‚Äôre sat down and the French people next to us get brought more drinks once theirs are nearly empty. No such service for us. Then nuts and olives are being handed out to everyone before dinner. The French speaking tables all next to us get given these but with a plate in hand he skips us and goes to the next table. I wouldn‚Äôt expect to be waited on like that normally but if you are offering it to some it needs to be offered to all.    On the last day we went over to the other hotel (das atlas) and it is like you are on another planet. The food is better for starters and the staff treat you correctly. We were brought drinks and snacks just like everyone else sat down near us. Wish we would have booked that one and not where we did as it‚Äôs 1000x better.    @ Hotel manager if you wish to discuss it further we checked out 26/11 and were in room 418 so you should have our details.    TL/DR  If you‚Äôre not French don‚Äôt book here book das atlas. Same hotel complex better service.

Valeria Madina Club Resort,Holidayreviewerldn wrote a review Oct 2022,20,Hotel has so much potential‚Ä¶,Positives:  * Yehea (English speaking Rep)  * Mango restaurant/ pool  * Water slides    Negatives:  * Not a hotel for English people (French only)  * Read below    This hotel has so much potential & it‚Äôs such a shame that the owners are greedy and not reinvesting the money made back into the hotel.    They checked us in to our rooms when the cleaners had not even finished cleaning. Not something I‚Äôm used to as this doesn‚Äôt happen in the UK. So the room was not completed/cleaned properly.  The hotel door does not even lock - door handle broke a few times.    The wifi is another story..just sit at reception when you want internet.    The hotel rooms and some of the hotel is very dated the rooms and decor.  It is nearly 2023 and the decor of the hotel is still in 2002.  Even the do not disturb door hangers are old and need replacing.    The cleaners come to your room in the morning to take dirty towels and do not replace with clean towels until around 2pm in the afternoon. The lady came took our towels to clean so when we wanted to dry our skin after a shower we couldn‚Äôt.  I do not think the hotel has ‚Äòextra towels‚Äô normally in other hotels the cleaner would take the dirty towels and replace there and then with new ones? This doesn‚Äôt make sense.    On our last night getting into bed we found fried pieces of food under our pillow which was very odd ?! (Could it be witchcraft) as we did not even any food in the room other than a water bottle nor did we carry food back from anywhere.    The staff at reception are not really friendly unless you speak French. The hotel manager & Yehea are lovely. Thank you Yahea for your friendly welcome/ help.    Went for a 50 minute spa which was not really relaxing. The masseuses kept whispering/talking and giggling. Not really massaging either but just rubbing the oil into my skin. Also the lady messaged my breast. I have never experienced this before in a spa - not sure how to feel either.    The drink machine in the food section / restaurant is ridiculous! All drink options are finished so if you want Pepsi or Fanta you will get sparkling water and the staff do not care.    There is not enough food options for the size of the food eating area.  The food is ok. Lacks flavour and taste.  This is a large hotel with only a total 7 options including pasta meat and rice.    They provide a fridge in the room that is not even filled with basic bottled water. Hotel shop does not sell drinks either‚Ä¶so if I‚Äôm thirsty during the night when everything is closed do I need to get a taxi to Marrakesh town?    The bathroom needs a good clean and a new door due to the water from the shower (wet room) everything gets wet. Behind the toilet is disgusting and the taps were not cleaned properly by the looks of it.    Booked a double room for 2 people and was only given 1 towel and 1 seat on the balcony. But we got 3 bed blankets‚Ä¶  I would not recommend this hotel to anyone and would not even come back if it was free of charge.    Again the hotel owners and management need to take on this feedback and the other reviews & make some changes as it has so much potential to be a great modern hotel.

If you do not speak French or Moroccan you kind of feel like you are being treated differently as noone comes to your table or responds. Had to complain a few times to get some form of service or acknowledgement.  Another worst thing was no lights at night when going up and down the stairs to the rooms. The censor lights come on after you finished the stairs which is bizarre ü§î.  My friend missed a step and fell one night on our way to dinner.luckily just her shoe was broken not her legs.

Valeria Madina Club Resort,Natasha J wrote a review Aug 2022,40,"Lovely visit, helpful staff and a beautiful hotel",I stayed at the Medina hotel when we were offered alternative accommodation by loveholidays between 5th and 9th August. We were originally staying in the sister hotel Club Dar Atlas but it had been overbooked. Despite this we had a brilliant time at the Medina hotel and the staff were very helpful and accommodating especially Yahia who was able to help us and make us feel welcome. He always made sure we were okay and having fun and helped solve any problems we had. We had some trouble with room allocation at first but Yahia made sure we were comfortable and changed our rooms and made us feel like nothing was too much to ask for. This made for a relaxing experience and we wished we had stayed for a few days longer. The hotel itself was clean and had lots of entertainment on offer. There were multiple pools to choose from and even a splash park which was great. We went on some excursions including going to the market and going to Ozoud waterfall and we also went to the desert for camel riding and a nice meal with an entertainment show. These excursions were fairly priced but were far to travel to (except the market). Overall we had a good experience and had a great time.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/354natashaj
Valeria Madina Club Resort,Darcie B wrote a review Aug 2022,50,Our visit to Valeria Madina Club resort,Wow. Our holiday at this hotel was nothing but fantastic! The resort was absolutely stunning with so much to do during the day like football aqua Zumba volleyball darts dance slip and slide etc. The weather was glorious too. The food was absolutely amazing with so much choice. Sometimes going abroad you can struggle to find foods you like but there were so many familiar options too like spag Bol nuggets pancakes etc. What definitely topped our holiday off was the staff at the hotel. From the second we arrived we were greeted by Yahalia who was nothing but polite and helpful and throughout the whole holiday he was always so energetic and fun when he saw us. We were also greeted by Usef who looks after a lot of the English visitors at the hotel he was incredible and so so helpful and made sure when we were leaving early when it was time to depart that we didn‚Äôt leave without breakfast at 6am. The hotel animation team were nothing but amazing Zineb Eva-Lyna Abdul and Will were ones that stood out to us they were so happy and polite and were always involved to make sure we were having the best time. The hotel is mainly French speaking but by October they are hoping to incorporate more English speaking staff members. Although alot of the staff could speak a good amount of English. When some things were in French Abdul In particular would come up to us and tell us what was being said in English to make sure we understood which was so inclusive. Even though the entertainment is mainly in French we could still enjoy watching them as there was a lot of dancing acrobats talents shows etc. The rooms were immaculate and were being cleaned all the time and we were always provided with fresh towels etc. Overall an absolutely amazing experience that we will never forget!

Valeria Madina Club Resort,Haffez wrote a review Jun 2022,50,Excellent family experience,We arrived on the mid June for a week and were given two rooms on the 2nd floor. The rooms were very clean and tidy and cleaned and towels changed everyday. The rooms were a decent enough size with small balconies.  The staff were always very polite and assisted whenever we had a query and also always smiling.  The food selection changes most days and there is also a pizza bar where they constantly making fresh pizzas. The food selection ranged from local Moroccan dishes to paellas seafood rabbit etc and there was plenty of choice for all the family. The fresh salads and sweets were delicious.  The pool ( I think 7 in total) were clean plenty of sunbeds which were undamaged and also various areas to lay in the shade of the sun became too intense. Also was the waterslides which were great fun all included on the site.  Every night and during the day they had entertainment ranging from singers dancers and locally themed nights as well.  The daytime they had exercise classes within the swimming pool and the resort entertainment staff worked very hard keeping the holidayers involved. However if you want to just be left alone and relax again this can be done. They even have a pool which is for adults only with beds next to the pool which allowed some peace and time away if required.  There are numerous excursions available from quads to spas trips to the mountains etc.  The place was kept very clean the staff work very hard to keep guests happy and were very courteous.  Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our time here and would come back and I hope they keep the standards they have worked so hard to set and many more people come and enjoy the experience.,Date of stay: June 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Haffez

Valeria Madina Club Resort,eltond89 wrote a review May 2022,40,Overall Good Holiday,I visited this hotel for 1 week with my daughter over Easter.  The hotel itself was spotless room cleaned every day and towels changed.  The food was fantastic though if you enjoy a full English breakfast you will be disappointed. The breakfast was continental but they have an area outside where fresh pancakes are made and you could ask for fried eggs. The restaurant staff are all friendly and helpful and our waiter had a bottle of wine chilling on our table every lunchtime.  The bar staff and reception staff were extremely rude to us we were the only English guests staying at the hotel initially and unfortunately my French is very limited that said a smile is the same no matter what language you speak. We spoke to the hotel Manager on the 3rd day about the way the staff were treating us and he was absolutely fantastic. He spoke with the staff and to their credit they were very friendly and helpful to us after that. The Manager went above and beyond to find us every day to check we were OK.  The pool areas are lovely and clean and pool staff were always on hand to assist should you need anything.  We took the shuttle bus to the Medina a couple of times and got a taxi back for ‚Ç¨20. The medina is approximately 25 minute drive from the hotel.  We looked at the excursions available from the hotel but all the information was in French as were all of the information boards detailing what was on.  This is a beautiful Hotel and the Manager pulled out all the stops to check we were OK that said unless you can speak French or are just looking for a base I would not recommend this hotel to English guests.,Date of stay: April 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Norwich, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eltond89

Valeria Madina Club Resort,Hannah W wrote a review Sep 2021,50,Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better holiday!!,So I‚Äôll start by saying that this will be a very detailed review but there is good reason for it! Hopefully it may also help someone else get a clear picture of the service and experience.    Initially my friend and I had booked to stay at a different hotel through our chosen holiday provider however we were informed the day before departure that the original hotel had closed and that our stay had been transferred to Club Madina - I can‚Äôt stress enough how happy this change ended up making us!    Upon arrival it was clear that our holiday operator hadn‚Äôt provided Club Madina with any notice as our details weren‚Äôt in the system anywhere. This could have been an extremely stressful situation however the reception staff and the hotel manager Adil sorted everything for us within an hour and had our room ready 2 hours earlier than the check in time - we had a drink at one of the bars whilst we waited. Our room was extremely easy to find as there is plentiful and clear signage all around the hotel and our bags were brought to our room within 5-10 minutes (please ensure to tip as these employees work extremely hard!). The grounds were absolutely beautiful and immaculately maintained in such a hot climate.    The room was spotless and smelled fresh as well as having a lovely balcony and an authentic Moroccan feel to it. There was a mini fridge a small hairdryer towels (full size hand towels and a bath mat which were replaced every day) hand soap and air conditioning. You would need to bring your own toiletries like shower gel and shampoo/conditioner but that was a given for me as I always bring my own.    Our room was a short walk away from reception the buffet restaurant and the 3 main pools all of which were also spotless. There is a main pool where all of the entertainment and activities take place a smaller shallower pool to the left of it which has a volleyball net and regular volleyball games which was so fun. There is also a beautiful pool to the right of the main pool which was also shallow and had a beautiful fountain/water piece in the middle of it. For people that are all inclusive the small on-site water park is free. It is definitely very small with only 4 or 5 slides and not your traditional ‚ÄòEuropean‚Äô water park in the sense that there is a slight shortage of inflatables and there are no sun loungers around the slides only chairs facing them. However the slides that are there are fun and we had a laugh on them. There is also another large pool at the other end of the waterpark which is lovely and is quieter than the main pools. It also has a good number of lovely sun beds and umbrellas.    The entertainment at the hotel was utterly brilliant and consistently so. There was entertainment and activities by and in the pool every day from around 10am and included a variety of things such as Aqua Zumba aqua aerobics pool parties water polo team games and dancing. There were also demonstrations of traditional Moroccan food and drink such as tagine and Moroccan tea as well as traditional Moroccan dancers that would perform around the pool. The nighttime entertainment was just as good and although it was almost entirely in french it doesn‚Äôt take away from the overall atmosphere and we actually picked up some french over our two week stay. The animation team is phenomenal and they really made our stay for us as did the rest of the staff including the restaurant staff and the fantastic cleaning staff. The hotel is also extremely safe for children and families there are security guards on shift constantly and the staff take the time to get to know you and all of the kids so you know they are safe.    From the animation team - Salah Will Zaineb Abdel Tony and Joe made particular impressions on us as they always made a specific effort to come and say hello and involve us in any activities and games. They also translated everything for us as their English was fantastic. There were also several other animation staff who were equally as good but didn‚Äôt get to spend as much time with so can‚Äôt quite remember their names. Our cleaner was amazing and always went the extra mile to leave a special surprise.    The food was good overall however there were the occasional meal time that we were disappointed with the lack of variety. The restaurant staff were fabulous especially mustapha who ran the evening meal times he always made a special effort for our table and is a credit to the hotel. At lunch time there is a good and light selection of food and there is an option to get food in a pool side bar and at a little station next to the restaurant outside of meal times.    There is an on-site nurse and infirmary which is overall good. We had a bit of a stomach bug on one of our last days which the nurse promptly treated with anti-sickness tablets which appeared to help. The service was quick and efficient and the only downside was that the nurse spoke no English whatsoever.    If you require a COVID test to return to a resident country at the time of your stay I recommend researching somewhere in advance. We had our test done by the on-site medical staff (the same nurse and what appeared to be an on-call doctor) and in all honesty it was a nightmare. It was by far the worst part of the holiday and an anxious 32 hours! We had the COVID test booked for 11am on the Saturday (we travelled home Monday) and when we arrived albeit 10 minutes early the nurse was not there. We waited for nearly 40 minutes for her to arrive by which point we had made our way to reception who phoned her. Despite her arrival we had to wait a further 20 minutes for another woman (who we assume was a doctor) to arrive to carry out the test. We were unaware of the reason for the delay due to the language barrier however the test was carried out and we paid. The price was 500 Moroccan Dirhams which was around ¬£50 for a PCR. We counted the money in front of both the nurse and the doctor and we handed it over to the doctor who then also counted it. There was some discussion between the two women in Arabic and we said thank you and left. We had been back in our room for about 5 minutes when there was a knock on the door which was the nurse and the doctor who proceeded to tell us that we had underpaid by 200 MAD (around ¬£20). I was entirely taken aback by this and tried to translate as best we could that we without a doubt paid the full amount to them that we counted it they counted it and there was no problem. They continued to persist and kept insisting we had underpaid at which point I went straight to reception and relayed the issue. The reception staff contacted the hotel manager who came to reception to help resolve the issue. By this time the nurse and doctor had arrived at reception and Adil the manager spoke to both members of staff. He resolved it promptly and effectively and was polite and friendly the whole time. I believe this reflects more on the two individual members of staff than the hotel as from the minute I raised my issue the hotel dealt with it brilliantly. We were both told the results would take 24 hours which would take us to just under 24 hours before our departure time and 12pm local time however we did not get our results until 9pm the following night. The hotel however realised how important these tests were and actually hand delivered them to us at our dinner table after specially locating us which I thought was a lovely touch. I just wanted to raise the whole scenario for general awareness.    The only other negative of our stay (and again this doesn‚Äôt reflect on the hotel at all) was that you couldn‚Äôt leave any form of inflatables such as lilos or beach balls unsupervised due to children and other adults just taking them and using them. We had bought one on our second day and within 6 hours it had been popped by kids. We just brushed it off and accepted it as our thoughts were they‚Äôre only kids and we should have been more cautious about leaving it near our sun beds. We then bought another two as we realised we both wanted one and at least once a day we had to ask random people to get off them despite them being near our sun beds. We were then extra cautious and began leaving them under our sun beds so it was entirely clear they were ours. We returned from lunch on one of our last days (we‚Äôd been gone about half an hour) to find that both lilos had disappeared from our stuff and that a random child and a random adult couple had taken them one of which were popped. At this point my friend asked them both to get off and the man from the adult couple began raising his voice at my friend. He then spat at her which appeared to go completely unreprimanded however the hotel reception staff when reported appeared to take it seriously and they also provided us with a new lilo. Again just something to be aware of and didn‚Äôt detract from our overall stay and enjoyment.    Despite the minimal negative points we had an absolutely superb time and we are actually planning to book our second stay with more people next august in the next few weeks we loved it that much. Fantastic staff team beautiful and clean hotel and such a culture rich country we couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better holiday.

The food was lovely. The reception staff were very nice. The pool is heated so was perfect for winter visit. This hotel is all French speaking. All entertainment was in french. It's pretty far from marrakech. There is a bus that you can pay 4 euros for return to marrakech from the hotel. A lot of the hotel was closed for refurbishment the main restaurant was half open the pool bar was closed and one of the pools were closed. The hotel also has plastic recycling bins all around which I think is very good.,Date of stay: February 2020,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobbieg2019

Valeria Madina Club Resort,Gayle'n'stu wrote a review Dec 2019,10,Disappointed,"My wife and myself stayed in Club Marmara Medina for 7 nights at the beginning of November and were unfortunately disappointed with the hotel. First impressions were not good on check-in when we were just given wrists bands and told to""go and eat come back later"" in very broken English. No directions or instructions given as to where to go or what was available! Found the dining area had something to eat then went back to reception to finally get our room. We were not given any information about the hotel or any facilities etc.  Room was ok needed TLC but reasonably clean. No tea/coffee making facilities but room was ok.  We soon discovered that the hotel was basically French speaking only hardly any staff spoke English and this was especially difficult in the snack bar when trying to get drinks. It also wasn't made clear what was included in the all-inclusive package that we had.  The food in the main dining area was very good but the experience in there ruined it sparrows were flying around everywhere and sitting on the tables and chairs! The area that the food was served was limited on space and got extremely busy with people pushing in and not making it a nice experience. You then had to try and find a table! To get a drink was not always easy as you had to try and get a waiters attention then hope they had what you wanted - wine seemed to be hard to get sometimes! The only waiter who seemed to speak English was Ismail (?) and he was extremely helpful and attentive.  The main pool area was ok although all the poolside entertainment was only in French - would have liked to join in but couldn't understand any of it! Pool was cold but you soon got used to it.  There was evening entertainment although again was always in French although luckily we met a really lovely English couple that we spent a couple of evenings with.  All in all disappointed with the overall standards of the hotel and facilities and would not recommend as we felt very isolated and ""non-inclusive"" as English speakers.",Date of stay: November 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gayle_stu123
Valeria Madina Club Resort,Travels_with_Michelle wrote a review Nov 2019,10,"Disappointed, let down, will not return : (",My partner and I have just returned from five nights in Marrakesh. I‚Äôve tried to provide as much detail as possible on the hotel. Please find our comments below ‚Äì    Airport taxi  We picked up a taxi from outside the airport. There were loads of taxis available at the taxi rank so we didn‚Äôt have to wait at all.  It turns out we overpaid for our taxi from the airport to the hotel. We were charged 350 dirhams however I believe the maximum price should be 150 - 200 dirhams. On this occasion we didn‚Äôt mind paying a little bit extra as we know airport taxis can charge a little bit more.  Please be aware the taxi drivers are a little adventurous out there. Weaving in and out of traffic appears to be the norm here. Be sure to wear a seatbelt.    Arrival / Check-in  Upon arrival at the hotel we found the staff fairly unhelpful and unapproachable.  We were promptly handed bright green plastic wristbands to reflect our all-inclusive access. I was under the impression this was an all-inclusive hotel so it‚Äôs a little embarrassing to wear this wristband throughout our stay. However it is the hotel policy.  We had requested a double bed within our room but the reception staff informed us they were fully booked and we will only have two single beds pushed together. This was a little disappointing however would be the least of our worries.  We were handed a key card to our room and the reception staff merely pointed in the direction we were meant to head and that was it! No further information was given to us at all. The resort is fairly large and we had no idea which direction to head in and which activities were taking place what time dinner would be where we could find the bar. At this point we were simply left to our own devices.    Our Room  We eventually found our room in the first block Riad block 100.  The room was extremely basic. It‚Äôs a good size room but really in need of a lick of paint and modernising.  The room had an open wardrobe a hairdryer but no iron or ironing board. The room did not have any toiletries so I would recommend bringing these from home.  There is a shower room and separate toilet. There is also a balcony albeit with white plastic patio furniture. The view from our balcony was lacking and non-existent. We did have a safe in our room which we were under the impression was faulty. After informing reception we were told only at this point you would be charged to use the safe and upon payment would the safe then be available to you. It turns out our safe was broken anyway so we decided against a replacement and locked our belongings in our suitcase instead.    Pool Towels  We were not informed how to obtain towels for the pool. You have to ask around and then you are given the extensive instructions. It‚Äôs a bit of a drawn out process and a little extreme for the basic thin awful towels you receive at the end of it all. To borrow towels you are required to inform reception complete a form filling out your full name room number and date of departure. You are expected to keep this form with you for the entire duration of your holiday. You will then need to take this piece of paper to the towel Hut which only opens after 8:30 am. You are then required to hand over this piece of paper to the towel staff who then asks you which date you are leaving as they are unable to read your writing. You then exchange this piece of paper for your towels. As mentioned the towels are of poor quality. At the end of your visit to the pool you are expected to collect your towels and return them to the towel hut in exchange for your piece of paper. You have to repeat this process each time you wish to borrow a towel. It‚Äôs a little bit ridiculous.    Visit to the Pool  There are two good size pools at the hotel. There is also a very shallow pool which apparently is used for water volleyball. One pool is a little quieter than the other which includes an arch and water feature. This Pool is shallow and comes up to your knees and is also ice cold. However if you are looking for a quieter Pool experience then this may be the pool for you. We visited here on the first day and it was a nice experience however doesn‚Äôt get as much sun as the other pool throughout the day.  On our second day we visited the larger pool which has activities taking place all day and tends to be where the children are. This pool is full of life music and activities so if this is what you‚Äôre looking for this is the pool for you.  Please bear in mind the entertainment staff at this hotel only speak French. I cannot stress enough that all the activities and entertainment that take place around the pool are only spoken in French. As English speakers we felt extremely left out and were unable to participate in any of the spoken activities. It‚Äôs a real shame as we felt as though we had missed out on a lot of the entertainment which would keep you going throughout the day. Eventually it just gets irritating and annoying to hear another language on the microphone all day. Those that could understand French seemed to be enjoying themselves. But if you are not a  French speaker this is not the hotel for you.    Drinks & Bar areas  There are two bars open throughout the day which begin to serve alcoholic drinks after 12pm. Soft drinks are available before this time. As an all-inclusive member you will be able to order drinks from a very small selection on the menu. Please be aware that cocktails are not included within the all-inclusive menu. This was really disappointing. There is also no tableservice or drinks service available. Waiters will not ask you if you would like a drink or will serve your drinks to you around the pool. All drinks are to be collected from the bar yourself. Whilst you‚Äôre at the pool area all drinks are given to you in small flimsy white plastic cups those which you may find in the school canteen or at a kids party. We had no issue ordering two three four drinks at a time however the drinks you receive are tiny and after a few sips are finished within minutes. There are also lots of flies and wasps around the pool so I would recommend keeping drinks in your hand or drinking them quickly. It‚Äôs not difficulty to drink them quickly as they are so small. Please note again sometimes it is very difficult to order drinks as all the bar staff don‚Äôt really speak English. Most speak French or Arabic. So if you speak one of those languages you should be ok.    Food  On our first day we arrived late afternoon approximately 5 pm and at this time we weren‚Äôt really sure what time the restaurant opens for dinner or if there were any snacks available. We found out that there is a snack bar located a short walk from the pool but they stop serving food at 5 pm. It appears we just missed the cut-off but there seemed to be a few cakes and pastries left on one of the serving tables which also appeared to be covered in flies. So I would recommend if you wish to eat here that you eat here as soon as it opens before the food gets covered in flies.  Your key card comes in a paper holder which actually displays the time of breakfast lunch snacks and dinner. We were not informed this information was displayed here and only found this out on our second day.  There is one main buffet restaurant which appeared to be chaos and absolutely full of people at every sitting. I would recommend arriving early for breakfast lunch and dinner to avoid disappointment attempt to beat the rush and ensure you have access to all the food available. The restaurant offers a large buffet including a salad bar and desserts section. The layout of the buffet area is very narrow and gets extremely crowded. You are forever bumping into people and queueing doesn‚Äôt seem to exist here. Be sure to stand your ground and not let anyone push in front of you. When the food begins to run low it is often cold at this point however if you came back in a few minutes it would have been re-filled so it‚Äôs worth sticking around for something that you wish to eat. The restaurant wait staff will not locate a table for you you are expected to do this yourself before or after collecting your food from the buffet. If you collected your food from the buffet first and then attempted to find an available table it‚Äôs likely your food would be cold by this point.Upon arrival at the restaurant we would often struggle to find an available table for two people. When we eventually found a table it was often without cutlery or placemats. We would ask the wait staff to attempt to lay the cutlery for us however this could take up to 510 minutes on occasion so we ended up doing this ourselves whenever possible.  Ordering wine during lunch and dinner was a daily struggle. Often the wait staff would not understand English. We soon learnt the French phrase for White Wine! Wine for two people is served in a small bottle to share. This would be more than enough for 2 to share over lunch or dinner. And you can always ask for more. Often we would receive a small bottle of wine but no glasses! This would then take forever to receive glasses or you would receive tumbler water glasses and not wine glasses! It became an ongoing joke between my partner and I whether or not we would receive wine glasses each day! We would have a little celebration between the two of us if we would get one on the first ask! Or by a miracle Wine Glasses would already be on the table! But this is extremely rare!  The food itself was actually very good. Tagines are very popular here so don‚Äôt be surprised if you see one or two of these every day. Fish is often available here also however it‚Äôs unlikely to be fillets/ready to eat. You will have to de bone this first.  We found out on our third day that there is a snack bar where they make fresh pizzas in a Pizza oven. The snack bar is really hidden away and you wouldn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs there unless someone told you so definitely ask around for this. It usually opens between 12pm - 2 pm.  Late afternoon another snack bar will serve cakes and pastries however be sure to be quick as these go fairly rapidly.    Evening Entertainment  As it‚Äôs a buffet dinner your meal seems to be over fairly quickly so we found ourselves heading outside to watch the entertainment. This is often French games/quizzes run by one of the staff on a microphone followed by dancing which would generally be for the kids. One night they had karaoke another night they had a group dancing event however this is usually all over by 9 o‚Äôclock. Again it‚Äôs a little unfortunate that we couldn‚Äôt really get involved in any of the spoken activities as this was not translated. The evening entertainment was a little bit lacking and I found some of the staff to be very half-hearted which was a little embarrassing to watch. By 10pm the bar quietens down dramatically and there are only a few people around. There isn‚Äôt really much atmosphere and often music is clashing from one area of the bar to another. By 11pm the bar will only serve drinks that are paid for whether you are all-inclusive or not. This was a bit of a shock and really unfortunate. Actually it was a bit of a cheek.    Weather  Visiting in early November we knew the weather would be temperamental but still be in the early to mid 20s. When we first arrived it was a little overcast however the Sun came out solidly for the next couple of days. When there are no clouds and the Sun is high the weather is glorious. Towards the end of our trip it was overcast again and when windy it could actually feel a bit cold during the day. In the evenings the temperature drops dramatically. You will notice this more as it is hotter in the day but please be sure to take long trousers jeans jumpers shawls with you to wear in the evening as I cannot stress enough it gets very cold.    Excursions  Options of possible excursions were not offered to us at any point. If you wish to book an excursion there is a desk available in the main reception. The majority of the excursions are for French speakers only. We were advised away from booking certain excursions as we wouldn‚Äôt be able to enjoy them as much. This is really limiting. In the end we decided on a camel ride through the Palm Groves. I would definitely recommend this excursion. We were collected from our hotel at 10:30am and driven in a shuttle approximately 20 minutes away to the Palm Grove. They provided us with outfits and we were dressed in traditional clothing including headscarves and then had a good 1.5 hour tour. Halfway through we were taken to a local Moroccan house where they served us traditional fresh mint tea as well as cookies. This was a really nice touch. Our tour guide also took lots of photos of us during the trip so this was great.  On another day we decided to take a trip into Marrakesh. You can book a shuttle bus via the hotel for ‚Ç¨2 each. Unfortunately the shuttle bus provided by the hotel was fully booked on the day we decided to visit so be sure to book early if you wish to use this service. We ended up booking a taxi into town for 100 dihrams. We were dropped off at the square and made our way through the crowd. Beware of snakes and monkeys. You will be asked to interact and will be asked for money if you take any photos. If you enjoy people watching taking in the sights and admiring the local trinkets and treasures you will love the market there is so much to see however you will be hassled at every corner and workers will attempt to draw you in to everything at every possible moment. If you find this is too much for you then maybe get in and get out but it‚Äôs definitely worth a visit even if for a short time.    People  We found the staff at the hotel to be overall ok but need to work on their general customer service skills. Some are definitely more friendly than others. The majority of the holidaymakers are French and Arabic. There are very few English people that visit this resort. We met a lovely English couple and joined them for drinks at the bar on a few occasions. This was really nice and great to have another couple to talk to in English!    Summary  If you cannot speak French avoid this hotel.  Definitely not a 4star hotel as rated by Lastminute.com. Also it‚Äôs rated as a 3star hotel on loveholidays.com.  Check the weather before your visit. Make sure it‚Äôs in the early to mid 20s and clear skies otherwise it will be fairly cold during the day.  All in all I did have a nice trip however this was nothing to do with the hotel. I will not be returning to Club MarMara Madina.,Date of stay: November 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hertfordshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travels_w_michelle_e

Valeria Madina Club Resort,Sydney H wrote a review Oct 2019,40,"CLEAN, FRIENDLY AND LIVELY, BUT....",When we arrived the room wasn't ready which was fine as we arived at Noon. We went to the bar for 30 minutes and then it was ready. It was clean but as we were on the ground floor it was fairly dark. The patio door looked like it has been broken into from the outside and was fixed with a hook and loop on the inside. However there was a security man on site at night and we had no problem here. There are a lot of corridors which are tiled and there were a lot of children so the noise travelled LOUDLY at night. The food was excellent clean and tasty and the staff were always there to make sure everything was topped up and tidy. If you want alcohol with your meal in your all inclusive package you have to ask. Great entertainment around the pool if you want this BUT THE POOL WAS FREEZING AT ALL TIMES. The staff although very friendly when you get to know them are all French speaking so bear this in mind when booking. We didn't know this from the description with our holiday company and think this should be made clearer as when we went to book an excersion were told we could but that it would all be in French. However our tour guide was excellent when he knew we were English and did give us information in English but this might not always be the case. If the weather is not great then there really isn't a lot to do so again bear this in mind and take games etc. I would say that although this is a good budget holiday for a week (with good weather) any longer would become boring.

Valeria Madina Club Resort,Marty D wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Relaxing Hotel,Just got back from 5 days at this hotel. We arrived at 10.30 am. Our room wasn‚Äôt ready but they showed us to the bar and said to come back in half an hour. When we did it still wasn‚Äôt ready but they were so apologetic and took us to the dining room and promised it would be ready when we finished. We were ok with that as normally you can check into a hotel until about 2pm. We were shown to our room . It was on the ground floor and if I‚Äôm honest not the greatest. We asked if we could change and they happily did that without question.    Food  Food was lovely and very fresh. Always lots to chose from. We stuck to the three meals but there seemed to be different food served throughout the day.    Drinks  This was ok but you did have to pay for a few drinks that were not included in the all inclusive package. All cocktails were 5 euros and I had a baileys (this was not a real baileys) and this was also 5 euros. You didn‚Äôt get a very big drink. Everything was served in disposable plastic cups. 2 mouthfuls and it was gone. Not a problem we just got 2 at a time.    Cleanliness  The place was spotless. Everywhere was so clean    Staff  The staff spoke very little English but they really tried and we seemed to get round the language barrier.    Checkout  Checkout was mid day and we didn‚Äôt need to leave till 4pm . We were given a room to change and shower in. There was no charge for this.    WiFi  WiFi was good. We were lucky to get reception in our room ( block 2 ) was more than adequate.

Valeria Madina Club Resort,Travels_with_Michelle wrote a review Nov 2019,10,"Disappointed, let down, will not return : (",My partner and I have just returned from five nights in Marrakesh. I‚Äôve tried to provide as much detail as possible on the hotel. Please find our comments below ‚Äì    Airport taxi  We picked up a taxi from outside the airport. There were loads of taxis available at the taxi rank so we didn‚Äôt have to wait at all.  It turns out we overpaid for our taxi from the airport to the hotel. We were charged 350 dirhams however I believe the maximum price should be 150 - 200 dirhams. On this occasion we didn‚Äôt mind paying a little bit extra as we know airport taxis can charge a little bit more.  Please be aware the taxi drivers are a little adventurous out there. Weaving in and out of traffic appears to be the norm here. Be sure to wear a seatbelt.    Arrival / Check-in  Upon arrival at the hotel we found the staff fairly unhelpful and unapproachable.  We were promptly handed bright green plastic wristbands to reflect our all-inclusive access. I was under the impression this was an all-inclusive hotel so it‚Äôs a little embarrassing to wear this wristband throughout our stay. However it is the hotel policy.  We had requested a double bed within our room but the reception staff informed us they were fully booked and we will only have two single beds pushed together. This was a little disappointing however would be the least of our worries.  We were handed a key card to our room and the reception staff merely pointed in the direction we were meant to head and that was it! No further information was given to us at all. The resort is fairly large and we had no idea which direction to head in and which activities were taking place what time dinner would be where we could find the bar. At this point we were simply left to our own devices.    Our Room  We eventually found our room in the first block Riad block 100.  The room was extremely basic. It‚Äôs a good size room but really in need of a lick of paint and modernising.  The room had an open wardrobe a hairdryer but no iron or ironing board. The room did not have any toiletries so I would recommend bringing these from home.  There is a shower room and separate toilet. There is also a balcony albeit with white plastic patio furniture. The view from our balcony was lacking and non-existent. We did have a safe in our room which we were under the impression was faulty. After informing reception we were told only at this point you would be charged to use the safe and upon payment would the safe then be available to you. It turns out our safe was broken anyway so we decided against a replacement and locked our belongings in our suitcase instead.    Pool Towels  We were not informed how to obtain towels for the pool. You have to ask around and then you are given the extensive instructions. It‚Äôs a bit of a drawn out process and a little extreme for the basic thin awful towels you receive at the end of it all. To borrow towels you are required to inform reception complete a form filling out your full name room number and date of departure. You are expected to keep this form with you for the entire duration of your holiday. You will then need to take this piece of paper to the towel Hut which only opens after 8:30 am. You are then required to hand over this piece of paper to the towel staff who then asks you which date you are leaving as they are unable to read your writing. You then exchange this piece of paper for your towels. As mentioned the towels are of poor quality. At the end of your visit to the pool you are expected to collect your towels and return them to the towel hut in exchange for your piece of paper. You have to repeat this process each time you wish to borrow a towel. It‚Äôs a little bit ridiculous.    Visit to the Pool  There are two good size pools at the hotel. There is also a very shallow pool which apparently is used for water volleyball. One pool is a little quieter than the other which includes an arch and water feature. This Pool is shallow and comes up to your knees and is also ice cold. However if you are looking for a quieter Pool experience then this may be the pool for you. We visited here on the first day and it was a nice experience however doesn‚Äôt get as much sun as the other pool throughout the day.  On our second day we visited the larger pool which has activities taking place all day and tends to be where the children are. This pool is full of life music and activities so if this is what you‚Äôre looking for this is the pool for you.  Please bear in mind the entertainment staff at this hotel only speak French. I cannot stress enough that all the activities and entertainment that take place around the pool are only spoken in French. As English speakers we felt extremely left out and were unable to participate in any of the spoken activities. It‚Äôs a real shame as we felt as though we had missed out on a lot of the entertainment which would keep you going throughout the day. Eventually it just gets irritating and annoying to hear another language on the microphone all day. Those that could understand French seemed to be enjoying themselves. But if you are not a  French speaker this is not the hotel for you.    Drinks & Bar areas  There are two bars open throughout the day which begin to serve alcoholic drinks after 12pm. Soft drinks are available before this time. As an all-inclusive member you will be able to order drinks from a very small selection on the menu. Please be aware that cocktails are not included within the all-inclusive menu. This was really disappointing. There is also no tableservice or drinks service available. Waiters will not ask you if you would like a drink or will serve your drinks to you around the pool. All drinks are to be collected from the bar yourself. Whilst you‚Äôre at the pool area all drinks are given to you in small flimsy white plastic cups those which you may find in the school canteen or at a kids party. We had no issue ordering two three four drinks at a time however the drinks you receive are tiny and after a few sips are finished within minutes. There are also lots of flies and wasps around the pool so I would recommend keeping drinks in your hand or drinking them quickly. It‚Äôs not difficulty to drink them quickly as they are so small. Please note again sometimes it is very difficult to order drinks as all the bar staff don‚Äôt really speak English. Most speak French or Arabic. So if you speak one of those languages you should be ok.    Food  On our first day we arrived late afternoon approximately 5 pm and at this time we weren‚Äôt really sure what time the restaurant opens for dinner or if there were any snacks available. We found out that there is a snack bar located a short walk from the pool but they stop serving food at 5 pm. It appears we just missed the cut-off but there seemed to be a few cakes and pastries left on one of the serving tables which also appeared to be covered in flies. So I would recommend if you wish to eat here that you eat here as soon as it opens before the food gets covered in flies.  Your key card comes in a paper holder which actually displays the time of breakfast lunch snacks and dinner. We were not informed this information was displayed here and only found this out on our second day.  There is one main buffet restaurant which appeared to be chaos and absolutely full of people at every sitting. I would recommend arriving early for breakfast lunch and dinner to avoid disappointment attempt to beat the rush and ensure you have access to all the food available. The restaurant offers a large buffet including a salad bar and desserts section. The layout of the buffet area is very narrow and gets extremely crowded. You are forever bumping into people and queueing doesn‚Äôt seem to exist here. Be sure to stand your ground and not let anyone push in front of you. When the food begins to run low it is often cold at this point however if you came back in a few minutes it would have been re-filled so it‚Äôs worth sticking around for something that you wish to eat. The restaurant wait staff will not locate a table for you you are expected to do this yourself before or after collecting your food from the buffet. If you collected your food from the buffet first and then attempted to find an available table it‚Äôs likely your food would be cold by this point.Upon arrival at the restaurant we would often struggle to find an available table for two people. When we eventually found a table it was often without cutlery or placemats. We would ask the wait staff to attempt to lay the cutlery for us however this could take up to 510 minutes on occasion so we ended up doing this ourselves whenever possible.  Ordering wine during lunch and dinner was a daily struggle. Often the wait staff would not understand English. We soon learnt the French phrase for White Wine! Wine for two people is served in a small bottle to share. This would be more than enough for 2 to share over lunch or dinner. And you can always ask for more. Often we would receive a small bottle of wine but no glasses! This would then take forever to receive glasses or you would receive tumbler water glasses and not wine glasses! It became an ongoing joke between my partner and I whether or not we would receive wine glasses each day! We would have a little celebration between the two of us if we would get one on the first ask! Or by a miracle Wine Glasses would already be on the table! But this is extremely rare!  The food itself was actually very good. Tagines are very popular here so don‚Äôt be surprised if you see one or two of these every day. Fish is often available here also however it‚Äôs unlikely to be fillets/ready to eat. You will have to de bone this first.  We found out on our third day that there is a snack bar where they make fresh pizzas in a Pizza oven. The snack bar is really hidden away and you wouldn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs there unless someone told you so definitely ask around for this. It usually opens between 12pm - 2 pm.  Late afternoon another snack bar will serve cakes and pastries however be sure to be quick as these go fairly rapidly.    Evening Entertainment  As it‚Äôs a buffet dinner your meal seems to be over fairly quickly so we found ourselves heading outside to watch the entertainment. This is often French games/quizzes run by one of the staff on a microphone followed by dancing which would generally be for the kids. One night they had karaoke another night they had a group dancing event however this is usually all over by 9 o‚Äôclock. Again it‚Äôs a little unfortunate that we couldn‚Äôt really get involved in any of the spoken activities as this was not translated. The evening entertainment was a little bit lacking and I found some of the staff to be very half-hearted which was a little embarrassing to watch. By 10pm the bar quietens down dramatically and there are only a few people around. There isn‚Äôt really much atmosphere and often music is clashing from one area of the bar to another. By 11pm the bar will only serve drinks that are paid for whether you are all-inclusive or not. This was a bit of a shock and really unfortunate. Actually it was a bit of a cheek.    Weather  Visiting in early November we knew the weather would be temperamental but still be in the early to mid 20s. When we first arrived it was a little overcast however the Sun came out solidly for the next couple of days. When there are no clouds and the Sun is high the weather is glorious. Towards the end of our trip it was overcast again and when windy it could actually feel a bit cold during the day. In the evenings the temperature drops dramatically. You will notice this more as it is hotter in the day but please be sure to take long trousers jeans jumpers shawls with you to wear in the evening as I cannot stress enough it gets very cold.    Excursions  Options of possible excursions were not offered to us at any point. If you wish to book an excursion there is a desk available in the main reception. The majority of the excursions are for French speakers only. We were advised away from booking certain excursions as we wouldn‚Äôt be able to enjoy them as much. This is really limiting. In the end we decided on a camel ride through the Palm Groves. I would definitely recommend this excursion. We were collected from our hotel at 10:30am and driven in a shuttle approximately 20 minutes away to the Palm Grove. They provided us with outfits and we were dressed in traditional clothing including headscarves and then had a good 1.5 hour tour. Halfway through we were taken to a local Moroccan house where they served us traditional fresh mint tea as well as cookies. This was a really nice touch. Our tour guide also took lots of photos of us during the trip so this was great.  On another day we decided to take a trip into Marrakesh. You can book a shuttle bus via the hotel for ‚Ç¨2 each. Unfortunately the shuttle bus provided by the hotel was fully booked on the day we decided to visit so be sure to book early if you wish to use this service. We ended up booking a taxi into town for 100 dihrams. We were dropped off at the square and made our way through the crowd. Beware of snakes and monkeys. You will be asked to interact and will be asked for money if you take any photos. If you enjoy people watching taking in the sights and admiring the local trinkets and treasures you will love the market there is so much to see however you will be hassled at every corner and workers will attempt to draw you in to everything at every possible moment. If you find this is too much for you then maybe get in and get out but it‚Äôs definitely worth a visit even if for a short time.    People  We found the staff at the hotel to be overall ok but need to work on their general customer service skills. Some are definitely more friendly than others. The majority of the holidaymakers are French and Arabic. There are very few English people that visit this resort. We met a lovely English couple and joined them for drinks at the bar on a few occasions. This was really nice and great to have another couple to talk to in English!    Summary  If you cannot speak French avoid this hotel.  Definitely not a 4star hotel as rated by Lastminute.com. Also it‚Äôs rated as a 3star hotel on loveholidays.com.  Check the weather before your visit. Make sure it‚Äôs in the early to mid 20s and clear skies otherwise it will be fairly cold during the day.  All in all I did have a nice trip however this was nothing to do with the hotel. I will not be returning to Club MarMara Madina.,Date of stay: November 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hertfordshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travels_w_michelle_e

Food was very good and acceptable though it was very busy at meal times and could be a bit annoying with rude people que jumping. French speaking hotel with the staff doing there best with the English they speak. Pools are lovely with plenty of Sun loungers for all and the sun was shining all week. Would reccomend the main markete in the city the hotel run a shuttle service to and from at set times the market is a must do while your here we had so much fun batering and haggling with the shop owners. All in all Marrakech was a wonderful romantic get away and just what we needed to relax and unwind. We would not hesitate to go back to this well run and very clean establishment.

Valeria Madina Club Resort,Sydney H wrote a review Oct 2019,40,"CLEAN, FRIENDLY AND LIVELY, BUT....",When we arrived the room wasn't ready which was fine as we arived at Noon. We went to the bar for 30 minutes and then it was ready. It was clean but as we were on the ground floor it was fairly dark. The patio door looked like it has been broken into from the outside and was fixed with a hook and loop on the inside. However there was a security man on site at night and we had no problem here. There are a lot of corridors which are tiled and there were a lot of children so the noise travelled LOUDLY at night. The food was excellent clean and tasty and the staff were always there to make sure everything was topped up and tidy. If you want alcohol with your meal in your all inclusive package you have to ask. Great entertainment around the pool if you want this BUT THE POOL WAS FREEZING AT ALL TIMES. The staff although very friendly when you get to know them are all French speaking so bear this in mind when booking. We didn't know this from the description with our holiday company and think this should be made clearer as when we went to book an excersion were told we could but that it would all be in French. However our tour guide was excellent when he knew we were English and did give us information in English but this might not always be the case. If the weather is not great then there really isn't a lot to do so again bear this in mind and take games etc. I would say that although this is a good budget holiday for a week (with good weather) any longer would become boring. I suspect this is the equivalent of a Pontins/Butlins abroad. Take a Kindle!,Date of stay: October 2019,,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/270sydneyh

Valeria Madina Club Resort,Marty D wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Relaxing Hotel,Just got back from 5 days at this hotel. We arrived at 10.30 am. Our room wasn‚Äôt ready but they showed us to the bar and said to come back in half an hour. When we did it still wasn‚Äôt ready but they were so apologetic and took us to the dining room and promised it would be ready when we finished. We were ok with that as normally you can check into a hotel until about 2pm. We were shown to our room . It was on the ground floor and if I‚Äôm honest not the greatest. We asked if we could change and they happily did that without question.    Food  Food was lovely and very fresh. Always lots to chose from. We stuck to the three meals but there seemed to be different food served throughout the day.    Drinks  This was ok but you did have to pay for a few drinks that were not included in the all inclusive package. All cocktails were 5 euros and I had a baileys (this was not a real baileys) and this was also 5 euros. You didn‚Äôt get a very big drink. Everything was served in disposable plastic cups. 2 mouthfuls and it was gone. Not a problem we just got 2 at a time.    Cleanliness  The place was spotless. Everywhere was so clean    Staff  The staff spoke very little English but they really tried and we seemed to get round the language barrier.    Checkout  Checkout was mid day and we didn‚Äôt need to leave till 4pm . We were given a room to change and shower in. There was no charge for this.    WiFi  WiFi was good. We were lucky to get reception in our room ( block 2 ) was more than adequate. We could use the internet all the time and could make calls home via WhatsApp.    We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel and would definitely stay again.

Valeria Madina Club Resort,Julie A wrote a review Feb 2020,40,Holiday,Reading the reviews on trip advisor I was slightly hesitant but once at the hotel dismissed all the reviews. I must advise that this is a french owned hotel with french speaking staff with limited English. All of the people on holiday here are FRENCH and I made some amazing friends here from France where we have exchange numbers and I must add I have very limited french language but putting all that aside this is a lovely hotel they are carrying out works in the food hall which will be completed for summer season. My room was basic but very clean and the room maid was very attentive and friendly loved the pool area with the fountain as this was quite compared to the main pool where they had daily activities with the animation team who were energetic and included people into the activities whether in the day or evening. Food was amazing and I sampled everything on offer didn‚Äôt disappoint yes there is sparrows around the hotel but they are at every hotel or place I visited in Morocco so don‚Äôt be put off they don‚Äôt intrude your space until you leave the table. So if you want to brush up on your french this is a lovely hotel.,Date of stay: February 2020,,"Leatherhead, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julieaS288QE
Valeria Madina Club Resort,Grace B wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Loved our stay at this hotel,We stayed in the hotel for 5 nights and loved it. Alot of choice in buffet food for all meals and drinks and snack available from the bar outside of these times.The feast they put on Christmas eve was outstanding and the live nativity play before dinner with real camels was amazing. The entertainers worked very hard keeping everyone entertained and amused from morning to late at night. All of the waiters and waitresses were very nice and helpful. Our room was cleaned daily and fresh towels provided everyday. All the staff were very nice to us.The bus service into Marrakech was great value at ‚Ç¨4 return and goes to and from multiple times a day.

Please note again sometimes it is very difficult to order drinks as all the bar staff don‚Äôt really speak English. Most speak French or Arabic. So if you speak one of those languages you should be ok.    Food  On our first day we arrived late afternoon approximately 5 pm and at this time we weren‚Äôt really sure what time the restaurant opens for dinner or if there were any snacks available. We found out that there is a snack bar located a short walk from the pool but they stop serving food at 5 pm. It appears we just missed the cut-off but there seemed to be a few cakes and pastries left on one of the serving tables which also appeared to be covered in flies. So I would recommend if you wish to eat here that you eat here as soon as it opens before the food gets covered in flies.  Your key card comes in a paper holder which actually displays the time of breakfast lunch snacks and dinner. We were not informed this information was displayed here and only found this out on our second day.  There is one main buffet restaurant which appeared to be chaos and absolutely full of people at every sitting. I would recommend arriving early for breakfast lunch and dinner to avoid disappointment attempt to beat the rush and ensure you have access to all the food available. The restaurant offers a large buffet including a salad bar and desserts section. The layout of the buffet area is very narrow and gets extremely crowded. You are forever bumping into people and queueing doesn‚Äôt seem to exist here. Be sure to stand your ground and not let anyone push in front of you. When the food begins to run low it is often cold at this point however if you came back in a few minutes it would have been re-filled so it‚Äôs worth sticking around for something that you wish to eat. The restaurant wait staff will not locate a table for you you are expected to do this yourself before or after collecting your food from the buffet. If you collected your food from the buffet first and then attempted to find an available table it‚Äôs likely your food would be cold by this point.Upon arrival at the restaurant we would often struggle to find an available table for two people. When we eventually found a table it was often without cutlery or placemats. We would ask the wait staff to attempt to lay the cutlery for us however this could take up to 510 minutes on occasion so we ended up doing this ourselves whenever possible.  Ordering wine during lunch and dinner was a daily struggle. Often the wait staff would not understand English. We soon learnt the French phrase for White Wine! Wine for two people is served in a small bottle to share. This would be more than enough for 2 to share over lunch or dinner. And you can always ask for more. Often we would receive a small bottle of wine but no glasses! This would then take forever to receive glasses or you would receive tumbler water glasses and not wine glasses! It became an ongoing joke between my partner and I whether or not we would receive wine glasses each day! We would have a little celebration between the two of us if we would get one on the first ask! Or by a miracle Wine Glasses would already be on the table! But this is extremely rare!  The food itself was actually very good. Tagines are very popular here so don‚Äôt be surprised if you see one or two of these every day. Fish is often available here also however it‚Äôs unlikely to be fillets/ready to eat. You will have to de bone this first.  We found out on our third day that there is a snack bar where they make fresh pizzas in a Pizza oven. The snack bar is really hidden away and you wouldn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs there unless someone told you so definitely ask around for this. It usually opens between 12pm - 2 pm.  Late afternoon another snack bar will serve cakes and pastries however be sure to be quick as these go fairly rapidly.    Evening Entertainment  As it‚Äôs a buffet dinner your meal seems to be over fairly quickly so we found ourselves heading outside to watch the entertainment. This is often French games/quizzes run by one of the staff on a microphone followed by dancing which would generally be for the kids. One night they had karaoke another night they had a group dancing event however this is usually all over by 9 o‚Äôclock. Again it‚Äôs a little unfortunate that we couldn‚Äôt really get involved in any of the spoken activities as this was not translated. The evening entertainment was a little bit lacking and I found some of the staff to be very half-hearted which was a little embarrassing to watch. By 10pm the bar quietens down dramatically and there are only a few people around. There isn‚Äôt really much atmosphere and often music is clashing from one area of the bar to another. By 11pm the bar will only serve drinks that are paid for whether you are all-inclusive or not. This was a bit of a shock and really unfortunate. Actually it was a bit of a cheek.    Weather  Visiting in early November we knew the weather would be temperamental but still be in the early to mid 20s. When we first arrived it was a little overcast however the Sun came out solidly for the next couple of days. When there are no clouds and the Sun is high the weather is glorious. Towards the end of our trip it was overcast again and when windy it could actually feel a bit cold during the day. In the evenings the temperature drops dramatically. You will notice this more as it is hotter in the day but please be sure to take long trousers jeans jumpers shawls with you to wear in the evening as I cannot stress enough it gets very cold.    Excursions  Options of possible excursions were not offered to us at any point. If you wish to book an excursion there is a desk available in the main reception. The majority of the excursions are for French speakers only. We were advised away from booking certain excursions as we wouldn‚Äôt be able to enjoy them as much. This is really limiting. In the end we decided on a camel ride through the Palm Groves. I would definitely recommend this excursion. We were collected from our hotel at 10:30am and driven in a shuttle approximately 20 minutes away to the Palm Grove. They provided us with outfits and we were dressed in traditional clothing including headscarves and then had a good 1.5 hour tour. Halfway through we were taken to a local Moroccan house where they served us traditional fresh mint tea as well as cookies. This was a really nice touch. Our tour guide also took lots of photos of us during the trip so this was great.  On another day we decided to take a trip into Marrakesh. You can book a shuttle bus via the hotel for ‚Ç¨2 each. Unfortunately the shuttle bus provided by the hotel was fully booked on the day we decided to visit so be sure to book early if you wish to use this service. We ended up booking a taxi into town for 100 dihrams. We were dropped off at the square and made our way through the crowd. Beware of snakes and monkeys. You will be asked to interact and will be asked for money if you take any photos. If you enjoy people watching taking in the sights and admiring the local trinkets and treasures you will love the market there is so much to see however you will be hassled at every corner and workers will attempt to draw you in to everything at every possible moment. If you find this is too much for you then maybe get in and get out but it‚Äôs definitely worth a visit even if for a short time.    People  We found the staff at the hotel to be overall ok but need to work on their general customer service skills. Some are definitely more friendly than others. The majority of the holidaymakers are French and Arabic. There are very few English people that visit this resort. We met a lovely English couple and joined them for drinks at the bar on a few occasions. This was really nice and great to have another couple to talk to in English!    Summary  If you cannot speak French avoid this hotel.  Definitely not a 4star hotel as rated by Lastminute.com. Also it‚Äôs rated as a 3star hotel on loveholidays.com.  Check the weather before your visit. Make sure it‚Äôs in the early to mid 20s and clear skies otherwise it will be fairly cold during the day.  All in all I did have a nice trip however this was nothing to do with the hotel. I will not be returning to Club MarMara Madina.,Date of stay: November 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hertfordshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travels_w_michelle_e

Food was very good and acceptable though it was very busy at meal times and could be a bit annoying with rude people que jumping. French speaking hotel with the staff doing there best with the English they speak. Pools are lovely with plenty of Sun loungers for all and the sun was shining all week. Would reccomend the main markete in the city the hotel run a shuttle service to and from at set times the market is a must do while your here we had so much fun batering and haggling with the shop owners. All in all Marrakech was a wonderful romantic get away and just what we needed to relax and unwind. We would not hesitate to go back to this well run and very clean establishment.

Valeria Madina Club Resort,Sydney H wrote a review Oct 2019,40,"CLEAN, FRIENDLY AND LIVELY, BUT....",When we arrived the room wasn't ready which was fine as we arived at Noon. We went to the bar for 30 minutes and then it was ready. It was clean but as we were on the ground floor it was fairly dark. The patio door looked like it has been broken into from the outside and was fixed with a hook and loop on the inside. However there was a security man on site at night and we had no problem here. There are a lot of corridors which are tiled and there were a lot of children so the noise travelled LOUDLY at night. The food was excellent clean and tasty and the staff were always there to make sure everything was topped up and tidy. If you want alcohol with your meal in your all inclusive package you have to ask. Great entertainment around the pool if you want this BUT THE POOL WAS FREEZING AT ALL TIMES. The staff although very friendly when you get to know them are all French speaking so bear this in mind when booking. We didn't know this from the description with our holiday company and think this should be made clearer as when we went to book an excersion were told we could but that it would all be in French. However our tour guide was excellent when he knew we were English and did give us information in English but this might not always be the case. If the weather is not great then there really isn't a lot to do so again bear this in mind and take games etc. I would say that although this is a good budget holiday for a week (with good weather) any longer would become boring. I suspect this is the equivalent of a Pontins/Butlins abroad. Take a Kindle!,Date of stay: October 2019,,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/270sydneyh

Valeria Madina Club Resort,Marty D wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Relaxing Hotel,Just got back from 5 days at this hotel. We arrived at 10.30 am. Our room wasn‚Äôt ready but they showed us to the bar and said to come back in half an hour. When we did it still wasn‚Äôt ready but they were so apologetic and took us to the dining room and promised it would be ready when we finished. We were ok with that as normally you can check into a hotel until about 2pm. We were shown to our room . It was on the ground floor and if I‚Äôm honest not the greatest. We asked if we could change and they happily did that without question.    Food  Food was lovely and very fresh. Always lots to chose from. We stuck to the three meals but there seemed to be different food served throughout the day.    Drinks  This was ok but you did have to pay for a few drinks that were not included in the all inclusive package. All cocktails were 5 euros and I had a baileys (this was not a real baileys) and this was also 5 euros. You didn‚Äôt get a very big drink. Everything was served in disposable plastic cups. 2 mouthfuls and it was gone. Not a problem we just got 2 at a time.    Cleanliness  The place was spotless. Everywhere was so clean    Staff  The staff spoke very little English but they really tried and we seemed to get round the language barrier.    Checkout  Checkout was mid day and we didn‚Äôt need to leave till 4pm . We were given a room to change and shower in. There was no charge for this.    WiFi  WiFi was good. We were lucky to get reception in our room ( block 2 ) was more than adequate. We could use the internet all the time and could make calls home via WhatsApp.    We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel and would definitely stay again.  Thank you all for your hard work and for making us very welcome,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Ipswich, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MartyD707
Valeria Madina Club Resort,Julie A wrote a review Feb 2020,40,Holiday,Reading the reviews on trip advisor I was slightly hesitant but once at the hotel dismissed all the reviews. I must advise that this is a french owned hotel with french speaking staff with limited English. All of the people on holiday here are FRENCH and I made some amazing friends here from France where we have exchange numbers and I must add I have very limited french language but putting all that aside this is a lovely hotel they are carrying out works in the food hall which will be completed for summer season. My room was basic but very clean and the room maid was very attentive and friendly loved the pool area with the fountain as this was quite compared to the main pool where they had daily activities with the animation team who were energetic and included people into the activities whether in the day or evening. Food was amazing and I sampled everything on offer didn‚Äôt disappoint yes there is sparrows around the hotel but they are at every hotel or place I visited in Morocco so don‚Äôt be put off they don‚Äôt intrude your space until you leave the table. So if you want to brush up on your french this is a lovely hotel.,Date of stay: February 2020,,"Leatherhead, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julieaS288QE
Valeria Madina Club Resort,Grace B wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Loved our stay at this hotel,We stayed in the hotel for 5 nights and loved it. Alot of choice in buffet food for all meals and drinks and snack available from the bar outside of these times.The feast they put on Christmas eve was outstanding and the live nativity play before dinner with real camels was amazing. The entertainers worked very hard keeping everyone entertained and amused from morning to late at night. All of the waiters and waitresses were very nice and helpful. Our room was cleaned daily and fresh towels provided everyday. All the staff were very nice to us.The bus service into Marrakech was great value at ‚Ç¨4 return and goes to and from multiple times a day. If we were to return to marrakech we would definitely booked this hotel again.

Valeria Madina Club Resort,Gayle'n'stu wrote a review Dec 2019,10,Disappointed,"My wife and myself stayed in Club Marmara Medina for 7 nights at the beginning of November and were unfortunately disappointed with the hotel. First impressions were not good on check-in when we were just given wrists bands and told to""go and eat come back later"" in very broken English. No directions or instructions given as to where to go or what was available! Found the dining area had something to eat then went back to reception to finally get our room. We were not given any information about the hotel or any facilities etc.  Room was ok needed TLC but reasonably clean. No tea/coffee making facilities but room was ok.  We soon discovered that the hotel was basically French speaking only hardly any staff spoke English and this was especially difficult in the snack bar when trying to get drinks. It also wasn't made clear what was included in the all-inclusive package that we had.  The food in the main dining area was very good but the experience in there ruined it sparrows were flying around everywhere and sitting on the tables and chairs! The area that the food was served was limited on space and got extremely busy with people pushing in and not making it a nice experience. You then had to try and find a table! To get a drink was not always easy as you had to try and get a waiters attention then hope they had what you wanted - wine seemed to be hard to get sometimes! The only waiter who seemed to speak English was Ismail (?) and he was extremely helpful and attentive.  The main pool area was ok although all the poolside entertainment was only in French - would have liked to join in but couldn't understand any of it! Pool was cold but you soon got used to it.  There was evening entertainment although again was always in French although luckily we met a really lovely English couple that we spent a couple of evenings with.  All in all disappointed with the overall standards of the hotel and facilities and would not recommend as we felt very isolated and ""non-inclusive"" as English speakers.",Date of stay: November 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gayle_stu123
Valeria Madina Club Resort,Travels_with_Michelle wrote a review Nov 2019,10,"Disappointed, let down, will not return : (",My partner and I have just returned from five nights in Marrakesh. I‚Äôve tried to provide as much detail as possible on the hotel. Please find our comments below ‚Äì    Airport taxi  We picked up a taxi from outside the airport. There were loads of taxis available at the taxi rank so we didn‚Äôt have to wait at all.  It turns out we overpaid for our taxi from the airport to the hotel. We were charged 350 dirhams however I believe the maximum price should be 150 - 200 dirhams. On this occasion we didn‚Äôt mind paying a little bit extra as we know airport taxis can charge a little bit more.  Please be aware the taxi drivers are a little adventurous out there. Weaving in and out of traffic appears to be the norm here. Be sure to wear a seatbelt.    Arrival / Check-in  Upon arrival at the hotel we found the staff fairly unhelpful and unapproachable.  We were promptly handed bright green plastic wristbands to reflect our all-inclusive access. I was under the impression this was an all-inclusive hotel so it‚Äôs a little embarrassing to wear this wristband throughout our stay. However it is the hotel policy.  We had requested a double bed within our room but the reception staff informed us they were fully booked and we will only have two single beds pushed together. This was a little disappointing however would be the least of our worries.  We were handed a key card to our room and the reception staff merely pointed in the direction we were meant to head and that was it! No further information was given to us at all. The resort is fairly large and we had no idea which direction to head in and which activities were taking place what time dinner would be where we could find the bar. At this point we were simply left to our own devices.    Our Room  We eventually found our room in the first block Riad block 100.  The room was extremely basic. It‚Äôs a good size room but really in need of a lick of paint and modernising.  The room had an open wardrobe a hairdryer but no iron or ironing board. The room did not have any toiletries so I would recommend bringing these from home.  There is a shower room and separate toilet. There is also a balcony albeit with white plastic patio furniture. The view from our balcony was lacking and non-existent. We did have a safe in our room which we were under the impression was faulty. After informing reception we were told only at this point you would be charged to use the safe and upon payment would the safe then be available to you. It turns out our safe was broken anyway so we decided against a replacement and locked our belongings in our suitcase instead.    Pool Towels  We were not informed how to obtain towels for the pool. You have to ask around and then you are given the extensive instructions. It‚Äôs a bit of a drawn out process and a little extreme for the basic thin awful towels you receive at the end of it all. To borrow towels you are required to inform reception complete a form filling out your full name room number and date of departure. You are expected to keep this form with you for the entire duration of your holiday. You will then need to take this piece of paper to the towel Hut which only opens after 8:30 am. You are then required to hand over this piece of paper to the towel staff who then asks you which date you are leaving as they are unable to read your writing. You then exchange this piece of paper for your towels. As mentioned the towels are of poor quality. At the end of your visit to the pool you are expected to collect your towels and return them to the towel hut in exchange for your piece of paper. You have to repeat this process each time you wish to borrow a towel. It‚Äôs a little bit ridiculous.    Visit to the Pool  There are two good size pools at the hotel. There is also a very shallow pool which apparently is used for water volleyball. One pool is a little quieter than the other which includes an arch and water feature. This Pool is shallow and comes up to your knees and is also ice cold. However if you are looking for a quieter Pool experience then this may be the pool for you. We visited here on the first day and it was a nice experience however doesn‚Äôt get as much sun as the other pool throughout the day.  On our second day we visited the larger pool which has activities taking place all day and tends to be where the children are. This pool is full of life music and activities so if this is what you‚Äôre looking for this is the pool for you.  Please bear in mind the entertainment staff at this hotel only speak French. I cannot stress enough that all the activities and entertainment that take place around the pool are only spoken in French. As English speakers we felt extremely left out and were unable to participate in any of the spoken activities. It‚Äôs a real shame as we felt as though we had missed out on a lot of the entertainment which would keep you going throughout the day. Eventually it just gets irritating and annoying to hear another language on the microphone all day. Those that could understand French seemed to be enjoying themselves. But if you are not a  French speaker this is not the hotel for you.    Drinks & Bar areas  There are two bars open throughout the day which begin to serve alcoholic drinks after 12pm. Soft drinks are available before this time. As an all-inclusive member you will be able to order drinks from a very small selection on the menu. Please be aware that cocktails are not included within the all-inclusive menu. This was really disappointing. There is also no tableservice or drinks service available. Waiters will not ask you if you would like a drink or will serve your drinks to you around the pool. All drinks are to be collected from the bar yourself. Whilst you‚Äôre at the pool area all drinks are given to you in small flimsy white plastic cups those which you may find in the school canteen or at a kids party. We had no issue ordering two three four drinks at a time however the drinks you receive are tiny and after a few sips are finished within minutes. There are also lots of flies and wasps around the pool so I would recommend keeping drinks in your hand or drinking them quickly. It‚Äôs not difficulty to drink them quickly as they are so small. Please note again sometimes it is very difficult to order drinks as all the bar staff don‚Äôt really speak English. Most speak French or Arabic. So if you speak one of those languages you should be ok.

We found out that there is a snack bar located a short walk from the pool but they stop serving food at 5 pm.

Our room wasn‚Äôt ready but they showed us to the bar and said to come back in half an hour. When we did it still wasn‚Äôt ready but they were so apologetic and took us to the dining room and promised it would be ready when we finished. We were ok with that as normally you can check into a hotel until about 2pm. We were shown to our room . It was on the ground floor and if I‚Äôm honest not the greatest. We asked if we could change and they happily did that without question.    Food  Food was lovely and very fresh. Always lots to chose from. We stuck to the three meals but there seemed to be different food served throughout the day.    Drinks  This was ok but you did have to pay for a few drinks that were not included in the all inclusive package. All cocktails were 5 euros and I had a baileys (this was not a real baileys) and this was also 5 euros. You didn‚Äôt get a very big drink. Everything was served in disposable plastic cups. 2 mouthfuls and it was gone. Not a problem we just got 2 at a time.    Cleanliness  The place was spotless.

Valeria Madina Club Resort,Julie A wrote a review Feb 2020,40,Holiday,Reading the reviews on trip advisor I was slightly hesitant but once at the hotel dismissed all the reviews. I must advise that this is a french owned hotel with french speaking staff with limited English. All of the people on holiday here are FRENCH and I made some amazing friends here from France where we have exchange numbers and I must add I have very limited french language but putting all that aside this is a lovely hotel they are carrying out works in the food hall which will be completed for summer season. My room was basic but very clean and the room maid was very attentive and friendly loved the pool area with the fountain as this was quite compared to the main pool where they had daily activities with the animation team who were energetic and included people into the activities whether in the day or evening. Food was amazing and I sampled everything on offer didn‚Äôt disappoint yes there is sparrows around the hotel but they are at every hotel or place I visited in Morocco so don‚Äôt be put off they don‚Äôt intrude your space until you leave the table. So if you want to brush up on your french this is a lovely hotel.,Date of stay: February 2020,,"Leatherhead, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julieaS288QE
Valeria Madina Club Resort,Grace B wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Loved our stay at this hotel,We stayed in the hotel for 5 nights and loved it. Alot of choice in buffet food for all meals and drinks and snack available from the bar outside of these times.The feast they put on Christmas eve was outstanding and the live nativity play before dinner with real camels was amazing. The entertainers worked very hard keeping everyone entertained and amused from morning to late at night. All of the waiters and waitresses were very nice and helpful. Our room was cleaned daily and fresh towels provided everyday. All the staff were very nice to us.The bus service into Marrakech was great value at ‚Ç¨4 return and goes to and from multiple times a day.

Valeria Madina Club Resort,Gayle'n'stu wrote a review Dec 2019,10,Disappointed,"My wife and myself stayed in Club Marmara Medina for 7 nights at the beginning of November and were unfortunately disappointed with the hotel. First impressions were not good on check-in when we were just given wrists bands and told to""go and eat come back later"" in very broken English. No directions or instructions given as to where to go or what was available! Found the dining area had something to eat then went back to reception to finally get our room. We were not given any information about the hotel or any facilities etc.  Room was ok needed TLC but reasonably clean. No tea/coffee making facilities but room was ok.  We soon discovered that the hotel was basically French speaking only hardly any staff spoke English and this was especially difficult in the snack bar when trying to get drinks. It also wasn't made clear what was included in the all-inclusive package that we had.  The food in the main dining area was very good but the experience in there ruined it sparrows were flying around everywhere and sitting on the tables and chairs! The area that the food was served was limited on space and got extremely busy with people pushing in and not making it a nice experience. You then had to try and find a table! To get a drink was not always easy as you had to try and get a waiters attention then hope they had what you wanted - wine seemed to be hard to get sometimes! The only waiter who seemed to speak English was Ismail (?) and he was extremely helpful and attentive.  The main pool area was ok although all the poolside entertainment was only in French - would have liked to join in but couldn't understand any of it! Pool was cold but you soon got used to it.  There was evening entertainment although again was always in French although luckily we met a really lovely English couple that we spent a couple of evenings with.  All in all disappointed with the overall standards of the hotel and facilities and would not recommend as we felt very isolated and ""non-inclusive"" as English speakers.",Date of stay: November 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gayle_stu123
Valeria Madina Club Resort,Travels_with_Michelle wrote a review Nov 2019,10,"Disappointed, let down, will not return : (",My partner and I have just returned from five nights in Marrakesh. I‚Äôve tried to provide as much detail as possible on the hotel. Please find our comments below ‚Äì    Airport taxi  We picked up a taxi from outside the airport. There were loads of taxis available at the taxi rank so we didn‚Äôt have to wait at all.  It turns out we overpaid for our taxi from the airport to the hotel. We were charged 350 dirhams however I believe the maximum price should be 150 - 200 dirhams. On this occasion we didn‚Äôt mind paying a little bit extra as we know airport taxis can charge a little bit more.  Please be aware the taxi drivers are a little adventurous out there. Weaving in and out of traffic appears to be the norm here. Be sure to wear a seatbelt.    Arrival / Check-in  Upon arrival at the hotel we found the staff fairly unhelpful and unapproachable.  We were promptly handed bright green plastic wristbands to reflect our all-inclusive access. I was under the impression this was an all-inclusive hotel so it‚Äôs a little embarrassing to wear this wristband throughout our stay. However it is the hotel policy.  We had requested a double bed within our room but the reception staff informed us they were fully booked and we will only have two single beds pushed together. This was a little disappointing however would be the least of our worries.  We were handed a key card to our room and the reception staff merely pointed in the direction we were meant to head and that was it! No further information was given to us at all. The resort is fairly large and we had no idea which direction to head in and which activities were taking place what time dinner would be where we could find the bar. At this point we were simply left to our own devices.    Our Room  We eventually found our room in the first block Riad block 100.  The room was extremely basic. It‚Äôs a good size room but really in need of a lick of paint and modernising.  The room had an open wardrobe a hairdryer but no iron or ironing board. The room did not have any toiletries so I would recommend bringing these from home.  There is a shower room and separate toilet. There is also a balcony albeit with white plastic patio furniture. The view from our balcony was lacking and non-existent. We did have a safe in our room which we were under the impression was faulty. After informing reception we were told only at this point you would be charged to use the safe and upon payment would the safe then be available to you. It turns out our safe was broken anyway so we decided against a replacement and locked our belongings in our suitcase instead.    Pool Towels  We were not informed how to obtain towels for the pool. You have to ask around and then you are given the extensive instructions. It‚Äôs a bit of a drawn out process and a little extreme for the basic thin awful towels you receive at the end of it all. To borrow towels you are required to inform reception complete a form filling out your full name room number and date of departure. You are expected to keep this form with you for the entire duration of your holiday. You will then need to take this piece of paper to the towel Hut which only opens after 8:30 am. You are then required to hand over this piece of paper to the towel staff who then asks you which date you are leaving as they are unable to read your writing. You then exchange this piece of paper for your towels. As mentioned the towels are of poor quality. At the end of your visit to the pool you are expected to collect your towels and return them to the towel hut in exchange for your piece of paper. You have to repeat this process each time you wish to borrow a towel. It‚Äôs a little bit ridiculous.    Visit to the Pool  There are two good size pools at the hotel. There is also a very shallow pool which apparently is used for water volleyball. One pool is a little quieter than the other which includes an arch and water feature. This Pool is shallow and comes up to your knees and is also ice cold. However if you are looking for a quieter Pool experience then this may be the pool for you. We visited here on the first day and it was a nice experience however doesn‚Äôt get as much sun as the other pool throughout the day.  On our second day we visited the larger pool which has activities taking place all day and tends to be where the children are. This pool is full of life music and activities so if this is what you‚Äôre looking for this is the pool for you.  Please bear in mind the entertainment staff at this hotel only speak French. I cannot stress enough that all the activities and entertainment that take place around the pool are only spoken in French. As English speakers we felt extremely left out and were unable to participate in any of the spoken activities. It‚Äôs a real shame as we felt as though we had missed out on a lot of the entertainment which would keep you going throughout the day. Eventually it just gets irritating and annoying to hear another language on the microphone all day. Those that could understand French seemed to be enjoying themselves. But if you are not a  French speaker this is not the hotel for you.    Drinks & Bar areas  There are two bars open throughout the day which begin to serve alcoholic drinks after 12pm. Soft drinks are available before this time. As an all-inclusive member you will be able to order drinks from a very small selection on the menu. Please be aware that cocktails are not included within the all-inclusive menu. This was really disappointing. There is also no tableservice or drinks service available. Waiters will not ask you if you would like a drink or will serve your drinks to you around the pool. All drinks are to be collected from the bar yourself. Whilst you‚Äôre at the pool area all drinks are given to you in small flimsy white plastic cups those which you may find in the school canteen or at a kids party. We had no issue ordering two three four drinks at a time however the drinks you receive are tiny and after a few sips are finished within minutes. There are also lots of flies and wasps around the pool so I would recommend keeping drinks in your hand or drinking them quickly. It‚Äôs not difficulty to drink them quickly as they are so small. Please note again sometimes it is very difficult to order drinks as all the bar staff don‚Äôt really speak English. Most speak French or Arabic. So if you speak one of those languages you should be ok.    Food  On our first day we arrived late afternoon approximately 5 pm and at this time we weren‚Äôt really sure what time the restaurant opens for dinner or if there were any snacks available. We found out that there is a snack bar located a short walk from the pool but they stop serving food at 5 pm. It appears we just missed the cut-off but there seemed to be a few cakes and pastries left on one of the serving tables which also appeared to be covered in flies. So I would recommend if you wish to eat here that you eat here as soon as it opens before the food gets covered in flies.  Your key card comes in a paper holder which actually displays the time of breakfast lunch snacks and dinner. We were not informed this information was displayed here and only found this out on our second day.  There is one main buffet restaurant which appeared to be chaos and absolutely full of people at every sitting. I would recommend arriving early for breakfast lunch and dinner to avoid disappointment attempt to beat the rush and ensure you have access to all the food available. The restaurant offers a large buffet including a salad bar and desserts section. The layout of the buffet area is very narrow and gets extremely crowded. You are forever bumping into people and queueing doesn‚Äôt seem to exist here. Be sure to stand your ground and not let anyone push in front of you. When the food begins to run low it is often cold at this point however if you came back in a few minutes it would have been re-filled so it‚Äôs worth sticking around for something that you wish to eat. The restaurant wait staff will not locate a table for you you are expected to do this yourself before or after collecting your food from the buffet. If you collected your food from the buffet first and then attempted to find an available table it‚Äôs likely your food would be cold by this point.Upon arrival at the restaurant we would often struggle to find an available table for two people. When we eventually found a table it was often without cutlery or placemats. We would ask the wait staff to attempt to lay the cutlery for us however this could take up to 510 minutes on occasion so we ended up doing this ourselves whenever possible.  Ordering wine during lunch and dinner was a daily struggle. Often the wait staff would not understand English. We soon learnt the French phrase for White Wine! Wine for two people is served in a small bottle to share. This would be more than enough for 2 to share over lunch or dinner. And you can always ask for more. Often we would receive a small bottle of wine but no glasses! This would then take forever to receive glasses or you would receive tumbler water glasses and not wine glasses! It became an ongoing joke between my partner and I whether or not we would receive wine glasses each day! We would have a little celebration between the two of us if we would get one on the first ask! Or by a miracle Wine Glasses would already be on the table! But this is extremely rare!  The food itself was actually very good. Tagines are very popular here so don‚Äôt be surprised if you see one or two of these every day. Fish is often available here also however it‚Äôs unlikely to be fillets/ready to eat. You will have to de bone this first.  We found out on our third day that there is a snack bar where they make fresh pizzas in a Pizza oven. The snack bar is really hidden away and you wouldn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs there unless someone told you so definitely ask around for this. It usually opens between 12pm - 2 pm.  Late afternoon another snack bar will serve cakes and pastries however be sure to be quick as these go fairly rapidly.    Evening Entertainment  As it‚Äôs a buffet dinner your meal seems to be over fairly quickly so we found ourselves heading outside to watch the entertainment. This is often French games/quizzes run by one of the staff on a microphone followed by dancing which would generally be for the kids. One night they had karaoke another night they had a group dancing event however this is usually all over by 9 o‚Äôclock. Again it‚Äôs a little unfortunate that we couldn‚Äôt really get involved in any of the spoken activities as this was not translated. The evening entertainment was a little bit lacking and I found some of the staff to be very half-hearted which was a little embarrassing to watch. By 10pm the bar quietens down dramatically and there are only a few people around. There isn‚Äôt really much atmosphere and often music is clashing from one area of the bar to another. By 11pm the bar will only serve drinks that are paid for whether you are all-inclusive or not. This was a bit of a shock and really unfortunate. Actually it was a bit of a cheek.    Weather  Visiting in early November we knew the weather would be temperamental but still be in the early to mid 20s. When we first arrived it was a little overcast however the Sun came out solidly for the next couple of days. When there are no clouds and the Sun is high the weather is glorious. Towards the end of our trip it was overcast again and when windy it could actually feel a bit cold during the day. In the evenings the temperature drops dramatically. You will notice this more as it is hotter in the day but please be sure to take long trousers jeans jumpers shawls with you to wear in the evening as I cannot stress enough it gets very cold.    Excursions  Options of possible excursions were not offered to us at any point. If you wish to book an excursion there is a desk available in the main reception. The majority of the excursions are for French speakers only. We were advised away from booking certain excursions as we wouldn‚Äôt be able to enjoy them as much. This is really limiting. In the end we decided on a camel ride through the Palm Groves. I would definitely recommend this excursion. We were collected from our hotel at 10:30am and driven in a shuttle approximately 20 minutes away to the Palm Grove. They provided us with outfits and we were dressed in traditional clothing including headscarves and then had a good 1.5 hour tour. Halfway through we were taken to a local Moroccan house where they served us traditional fresh mint tea as well as cookies. This was a really nice touch. Our tour guide also took lots of photos of us during the trip so this was great.  On another day we decided to take a trip into Marrakesh. You can book a shuttle bus via the hotel for ‚Ç¨2 each. Unfortunately the shuttle bus provided by the hotel was fully booked on the day we decided to visit so be sure to book early if you wish to use this service. We ended up booking a taxi into town for 100 dihrams. We were dropped off at the square and made our way through the crowd. Beware of snakes and monkeys. You will be asked to interact and will be asked for money if you take any photos. If you enjoy people watching taking in the sights and admiring the local trinkets and treasures you will love the market there is so much to see however you will be hassled at every corner and workers will attempt to draw you in to everything at every possible moment. If you find this is too much for you then maybe get in and get out but it‚Äôs definitely worth a visit even if for a short time.    People  We found the staff at the hotel to be overall ok but need to work on their general customer service skills. Some are definitely more friendly than others. The majority of the holidaymakers are French and Arabic. There are very few English people that visit this resort. We met a lovely English couple and joined them for drinks at the bar on a few occasions. This was really nice and great to have another couple to talk to in English!    Summary  If you cannot speak French avoid this hotel.  Definitely not a 4star hotel as rated by Lastminute.com. Also it‚Äôs rated as a 3star hotel on loveholidays.com.  Check the weather before your visit. Make sure it‚Äôs in the early to mid 20s and clear skies otherwise it will be fairly cold during the day.

Valeria Madina Club Resort,Sam W wrote a review Feb 2016,50,"First class hotel, excellent food, excellent facilities",The hotel is outside of the city about 20 minutes by taxi. There is a shuttle bus which is a bargain at 2 euros per person and runs frequently. The all inclusive basis is excellent the food was outstanding. There was so much to chose from and there was even an outside grill and pizzeria. Wine is a must and is placed on your table at lunch and dinner time without asking. The facilities are excellent. There is a heated outdoor pool and a couple of non heated ones. The rooms are clean and the staff are very helpful. There is a cash machine for those all important dirhams and a foreign exchange. It's a very family friendly hotel with lots to do. The only advice is that it is mainly used by the French so you will need to brush up on your language skills! I would definately stay again.,Date of stay: January 2016,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/885samw
Valeria Madina Club Resort,wellwhynot wrote a review Dec 2015,30,Great for tennis players. Budget family resort. Good buffet,We stayed at the Club Marmara Madina for a tennis tournament. The tennis facilities are excellent and well organised the hotel itself is a budget family resort with poolside entertainment throughout the day and evening - very lively if you like that sort of thing. It's all inclusive including wine and the buffet food was very good - geared for a French market. The al la carte restaurant was good - which is an extra but worth it. Nice grounds and plenty of room by the pools despite the fact that it was very busy - we could always find a relatively quite space. The spa was quite good and reasonably priced although not luxurious. There is a regular cheap shuttle bus to Marrakech - which we used a lot to explore Marrakech - which we loved. Wifi coverage very patchy - not suitable for keeping in touch with work. The rooms are quite spacious although we did ask for a double bed but only got two single beds pushed together - they hadn't connected them. The standards of cleanliness were poor. We stayed at the resort for a week and during the entire time the toilet had mosquito corpses on the walls. The shower room was adequate. And the cleaners often forgot to replace the towels. All in all it could be cleaner but for a week's break with lots of tennis it was good value.,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, UK",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wellwhynot
Valeria Madina Club Resort,maisonrenaissance wrote a review Dec 2014,40,Maramara Madina Club rating,Club Maramara Madina located outside of Marrakech is an excellent choice for first-timers to the area. The all-inclusive packages offer a wide variety of options for guests (couples family singles). If you go during the rainy season sign up for the spa package and use it on the days the weather is not so great. There is a shuttle (a few euro extra charge each way) that takes about 15 minutes into Marrakech. The security and service is very well organized. The food is excellent (especially on the day that the staff features Moroccan theme dishes). Don't miss the entertainment on the same night. They offer a variety show featuring street acrobats snake charmers belly dancers traditional Berber dance and music. They tie the show together by demonstrating local customs via the theme of a Moroccan wedding theme. The customer service in the hotel is very good. The Kik Plateau tour is a must-see. Tickets may be booked at the hotel and paid for with a major credit card. Make sure to have the other passengers agree to rotate the seat positions so that each individual gets a chance to see the amazing view from the center seat but also has the opportunity to rest in a comfy seat for awhile.,Date of stay: December 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Nave, Italy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maisonrenaissance
Valeria Madina Club Resort,lejettes wrote a review Mar 2014,50,Fantastic Holiday,Have just returned from a fantastic holiday at Club Marmara Madina.  Our room was lovelyover looking a lake which was surrounded by beautiful shrubs and orange and lemon trees. The staff were friendly and helpful. The choice of food outstanding and drinks included in the price where available at any time of the day. Very good value for money.    There was a good sized swimming pool and lots of activities. I really enjoyed the aqua gym and yoga. There is a health spa and hammam for those who want to relax. In the evening there are shows and we really enjoyed the Moroccan one. Shows are included in the price.    You can choose to be with people or on your own. Maybe it would not be suitable for someone looking for a very quiet holiday as there were 1000 people staying at the time we were there and music is played beside the pool. It was still possible to find quiet places to relax and read and the room was peaceful. I am English and there was only one other English person there and French is spoken for all the activities and shows.    There are daily tours and we chose to go Essaouira on the coast which took 3 hours as there is a 65 mph speed limit on the roads. We were looked after well by a very friendly guide on the coach and had a lovely day out.    I could not fault this holiday and Marrakech is a real experience!!! Go there!!,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,morlaix,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lejettes
Valeria Madina Club Resort,Arshad S wrote a review Apr 2013,40,A place to chillax Moroccan style.,What makes this experience stand out was the fantastic hospitality shown by the staff. French or Arabic is really important here but as the only English speaking guest at the hotel I can also confirm that I was really well looked after. This place was an excellent break for mum dad and three boys. The variety of Moroccan dishes available every night was amazing I can certainly vouch for that. We didn't really venture out to Marrakesh too often but it's cheap on the shuttle bus 20dh that's about 1.50¬£ for about 20km. They have three pools and a range of sporting activities going on to keep the kids busy during the day. In the evening the staff lay on shows to keep everyone entertained. My wife would recommend the spa. It is mixed normally but the girls were able to accommodate cultural sensitivities for her appointment. Overall we would use this hotel again as we travel to morocco every year.,Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/61ArshadS
