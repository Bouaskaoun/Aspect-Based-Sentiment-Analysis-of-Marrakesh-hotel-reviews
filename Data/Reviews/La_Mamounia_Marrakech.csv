La Mamounia Marrakech,rachna k wrote a review Mar 18,50,A must visit! and treat yourself to a cheeky cuppa.,This is such a beautiful hotel to visit when in Marrakech. All the employees were very welcoming and treated visitors with respect and hospitality. We took a walk around the gardens and then stopped for a Mint Tea and cakes in the the Salon De The.    The location is stunning the atmosphere opulent with a beautiful balance of an open hearted welcome.    I recommend this place to visit. I wish we didn’t have dinner reservations elsewhere as I would have loved to have enjoyed a meal in this location.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/714rachnak

La Mamounia Marrakech,Max25 wrote a review Mar 14,50,Has to unequivocally be one of the best hotels in the world.,It's breathtakingly expensive but it's also sublimely good to the point where you really do feel your experience is value for money. The renovation has restored it to a level of splendour that's very hard to fault - in the public spaces rooms or gardens. The staff are all over their briefs - efficient and friendly. The service and dining in the restaurants bars and at the pool is outstanding. If we could find any fault with our stay it would be that it feels a little stiff still - there's a formality that doesn't need to be there that brands like the Four Seasons do a little better - still absolutely professional but just not quite so starchy with it. And of course the location is amazing - in a city that feels like it's fast becoming the sexy exciting Mykonos of north Africa.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Max25
La Mamounia Marrakech,Expedition5060 wrote a review Mar 13,10,BOOK ELSEWHERE! Zero Customer Service.,"Go to the Four Seasons or Mandarin. After making an error in booking rooms that cost $1200/night I have emailed the reservations department and the general manager daily for over a week with zero response. I like luxury hotels and am a regular at them - this complete lack of interest in customer service and rooms that cost $400/night more than the Four Seasons is shameful. I guess every dog has its day and La Moumania is sadly not deserving of the title ""luxury hotel"" and there are better places to spend your hard earned money.",Date of stay: March 2023,,"Boston, MA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Expedition5060

La Mamounia Marrakech,Paul R wrote a review Mar 10,50,Visit for cocktails in the garden,We didn't stay here but visited for cocktails so my 5 out of 5 only relates to that. The greeting is special with guys dressed up in traditional costumes. The interior is stunning as are the grounds which are beautiful and manicured.. The hotel has its own Dior and YSL in the lobby amongst others. We had cocktails at a pavilion which offered fany afternoon tea at about £60 for two which given the quality was reasonably priced. Cocktails were good and cost about £14 each which was also good value comparatively.

La Mamounia Marrakech,professoressadarte wrote a review Mar 5,30,Mixed experience,We went to the bar for drinks and loved being there. Good drinks good service and lovely view of the spectacular gardens. Then we went to the Italian restaurant for dinner. What a letdown! The waiter misunderstood two orders. Those guests had to wait over a half hour after the others were served for their food and it was tasteless. It’s also way way overpriced. I’d go back for drinks for just seeing the place us worth the cost of a drink but I’d skip the meal.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Staunton, Virginia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/professoressadarte
La Mamounia Marrakech,Luxylassy wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Truly something Special',There are Luxury Hotels in the World and then there is THE LA MAMOUNIA in Marrakech a class apart.     Its gorgeous art-deco Moroccan fusion architecture sublime gardens and spaces all over are a sight to behold. The Hotel was buzzing with activity & guests during our entire week long stay.The Suites are beautifully appointed with stunning views of the grounds and city of Marrakech. There is a certain charm of being woken up by the call to prayer and really getting a pulse of the local life.    Enough cannot be said about all the various Dining options across the Hotel. From an incredible breakfast to Pierre Herme's delights there are a plethora of options. The Sunday brunch was one of the best we've had. The newly renovated Bar Le Churchill is an intimate setting and also provides access to the innovative concept of a cinema on demand - Luxury style.     The Spa provides the best Hamman experiences - you would be assured coming out feeling like your skin was reborn (in a great way).  The Hotel has adopted a sustainable approach on farm to table food concept. Its quite special to see the donkey cart ride carry all the vegetable supplies - Zatoni is a delight.    The heated pool is incredible to work out all the calories consumed as is the well laid out Gym - which stayed busy as well. Kids absolutely loved their time in the pool.    The wonderful Hotelier heading the Hotel Pierre Jochem is a legend in Hospitality and his touches are omnipresent all across. He truly has placed La Mamounia on the global map.    The Team on property has to be highlighted. From the local culture inspired dressing Doormen to the team members across the hotel - they enjoy serving and looking after the Guests. A few to note in Food & Beverage Hafza Medhi Rajah Ahmed at the bar they all are stars.      Splendid location allowed us to spend time walking around the most visited areas of Marrakech including Jemaa-el-Fnaa Koutoubia Mosque Bahia Palace all the souqs. This is your absolute go to Hotel in Marrakech - enjoy its spoils!,Date of stay: February 2023,,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luxylassy
La Mamounia Marrakech,Anne G wrote a review Feb 2023,40,Stepping back in time.,Although I didn't stay in a guest room at the hotel I did visit the bar with a friend. The staff were friendly and the ambience was lovely ... a 1920s theme. In fact the hotel is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year (2023).

La Mamounia Marrakech,Noisey Traveler wrote a review Feb 2023,20,Poor service - overpriced,3 nights as part of a 10 day trip to morocco    Pros  - beautiful room booked the duplex suite and it was perfect with two floors beautiful patio so much space.  - the grounds are beautiful  - wonderful location  - amazing pool - absolutely stunning  - great spa - 2 massages included if you book with Amex    Cons  - smells like smoke people smoking cigars inside at the bar and it permeates the rest of the hotel  - bad service. This part was shocking given the brand price and that most of Morocco had wonderful service. This mainly applied to the restaurants but also hotel staff (as an example - the offered us a boxed breakfast when we were leaving at 5 am we said yes - when we went to get it - they had no idea what we were talking about had to get a supervisor and then we would need 15 minutes to prepare it ..  - we complained about one of meals that was just shockingly bad and got no response  - numerous times we tried to get change - and were told to come back later when they would have change. Emails to the concierge went unanswered.    Ate at the Royal Mansour which is next door and just completely different. Much more elegant / high end / better food and service.

La Mamounia Marrakech,zahra wrote a review Jan 2023,40,Mamounia and Morroco,From the moment you enter the Mamounia everyone is at your service. There is no queuing for check in instead you are seated with refreshments and a member of staff comes to you to check you in.  The room was nice very rustic bed super comfy but for the amount you pay an night it was a slight let down a little small you do feel a bit claustrophobic and this was a level above a standard room.  We had dinner at the Asian restaurant and the head chef came out to check ingredients etc with us(I have allergies) and this was another example of the level of attention to detail they provide. Food was fantastic especially the chicken samosas. The lychee sorbet is also wow. Rashid at concierge was fantastic ready to give us advice on where to go where to eat etc. the indoor and outdoor pools are lovely and the pool boy Mohammed is there to give you star water and just so friendly. The staff is what makes this hotel 5 star.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Yazmine S wrote a review Jan 2023,10,overpriced tourist trap,I did not expect one of the most expensive meals I’ve ever ordered to also be one of the worst meals I’ve ever had to politely sit through. Our very British stiff upper lips were positively quivering with disgust by the end.    The soup entree tasted like the tomato sauce from a cold tin of Heinz with some stray chick peas peppered within for that ‘classic moroccan’ effect.    The bread was harder than Dwayne Johnson and Ross Kemp combined; not to mention cold. By this point I was already wandering if the bitter taste in my mouth was in my head or from this exorbitantly priced menu.    But Lo and Behold the main course gave me closure. It was definitely the food. Although i’m clearly still bitter to the core!    We both ordered tajines for the main course. My boyfriend’s chicken tajine was actually quite good although we had equally as good ones from roadside cafes at a fraction of the price.    I ordered the vegetarian which was just a dressed up boiled potato in some sour orange sauce. It tasted like a bland Welsh cawl stew I couldn’t actually eat it… in fact I went to the bathroom to be sick (which also had no toilet paper stocked)    I told the waiter as he came to clear my near to full plate that I didn’t really like it. They tried to offer me something else but by then all I wanted was to get out of there so I asked for the bill.    The waiter tells us dessert is included in the set menu so we’ll be charged for it whether we decide to order or not.    Enter the final course of disappointment! I have no idea how they even have the audacity to call this monstrosity a crème brûlée on the menu! It was stone cold. No indication of heat having been anywhere near it at any point that evening. The top layer was literally just granulated brown sugar. I tapped my spoon on the top hoping at least for a satisfying crunch but the thing was just a pitiful bowl of cold soft trash. I swiftly decided it wasn’t worth the calories and politely cast my spoon down with repressed rage. The other dessert? Some tinned fruit strewn over a watery scoop of orange sorbet.It had the messy presentation of a half-eaten school canteen fruit salad.    It’s a shame because the waiters were lovely the musicians were talented and full of joy the gardens and architecture were stunning. Save your money. Eat at a local place on the street then just pop in to have a drink.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yazmines2016
La Mamounia Marrakech,Lanvale135 wrote a review Jan 2023,40,Hollywood in Marrakech,Walking up Avenue Hommane Al Fatouaki with friends heading to the famous La Mamounia Hotel our anticipation was building. Entering the beautiful manicured grounds did not disappoint. Walking past Aston Martins Bentleys and a fleet of black Range Rovers you enter a world of luxury exotic fabrics and unparalleled views. We walked to the open bar/terrace garden and were seated immediately in a wonderful oasis of quiet. The drinks came with beautiful snacks linen napkins and were served expertly by unobtrusive yet attentive staff.

La Mamounia Marrakech,DiscerningTraveller wrote a review Dec 2022,50,Christmas stay,The loss of some very dear longstanding staff was mitigated by some bright new hires. Othmane in the Italian restaurant is incredible. I would also like to thank Caroline and Jinane in Guest Services for their care and attention. I really would like to thank Billa Naciri from the Sports team for being such a job to play with and a great coach.    Staying over Christmas does mean that the hotel is very busy and the serene seclusion a guest feels at the times of year both from the perspective of service and experience is not the same in December. However I would like to thank the hotel staff for constantly following up with me in regards to my stay.    In a Muslim country and in a hotel with lots of Jewish guests there simply must be non-pork pepperoni and bresaola options in the Italian restaurant. I would greatly appreciate that the hotel take this up with Jean-Georges.

La Mamounia Marrakech,HVTravelGirl wrote a review Dec 2022,50,Stunning Ambience and Spectacular Service,We stayed in La Mamounia for one night. The rooms and attention to detail are spectacular. Upon arrival you are treated with a warm almond and milk drink. We had two rooms all the way at the end of the hall on the second floor. One had a clawfoot tub and a beautiful enclosed patio. We were facing the street but found the room to be very quiet and pleasant. Waiting for us on arrival were Medjool dates and lovely handmade pastries. We had messages included with your rooms as was breakfast (booked using AmEx points). My message was ok but my husband said his was excellent. The pools are really spectacular and I highly recommend some time in the jaccuzi under the ornate gazebo ceiling. I highly recommend taking some time to walk around the spectacular gardens with orange trees. The outside pool was also beautiful but it was a little cold to swim. Breakfast was a buffet with a nice selection and seats outside in the pool area.    The only disappointment was the dinner. We ate a the Moroccan restaurant which requires that you do a 3 4 or 5 course price fix and was very expensive by local standards. The service and environment were excellent but we had much better and much less expensive food in other parts of Morocco. Everything was kind of overspiced and not super enjoyable. Otherwise we would highly recommend this hotel.,Date of stay: December 2022,,"Garrison, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HVTravelGirl
La Mamounia Marrakech,AMO wrote a review Dec 2022,50,Always outstanding but please bring back the Martinez!,I always visit here for a cocktail when in Marrakech.  This time was no exception.  Everything about this hotel is designed to welcome and relax. It is beautifully restored and perfectly designed with a modern twist without losing its heritage.  I had my first Martinez cocktail here in 2016. It was recommended by the waiter and has become my cocktail of choice ever since. Sadly when I asked it was not available which is very surprising. No matter as I enjoyed a well made negroni.  Please reinstate the Martinez tho as it was one of Churchill's favourite cocktails and he would approve of us all sipping it in the bar named after him.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Ghadeer2014 wrote a review Dec 2022,30,Built 1923,We stayed for 2 nights at La Mamounia so called a Palace hotel. Built 1923. The location is very close to The Koutoubia Mosque. The entrance is beautiful which has a lavish garden. Staff (ladies) on arrival were very hospitable and welcoming to our group. On arrival we were served chilled almond milk (cow milk mixed with orange blossom & almonds) and pitted dates the chilled drink was tasty. The Superior Room was OK it was rather ordinary comfortable though. Bathrooms were surprisingly small. The buffet breakfast hall had an outside table only. The breakfast was supposed to be ready at 7 am 7:15 am not fully ready. The croissant (see photo) was Over baked! The boiled egg I had was not cooled down after boiling I had to wait for it to cool down and be able to peel it easily. Staff during the day were casual and not professional nothing bad happen. Maybe I was expecting high level of professionalism. Other ladies in my group had received spa treatments and they said “the service was ordinary nothing special”. This is not a royal hotel.

La Mamounia Marrakech,RVTLondon89 wrote a review Dec 2022,30,a declining grand dame,This is our seventh stay in 20 years. La Mamounia is as beautiful as always but the service and attention to details has been declining:  - you’re not escorted anymore to the room which feels more proper of a sheraton than La mamounia  - there not fresh fruits anymore in the room (until 2 years there used to be a complimentary basket of fruit delivered daily to the room…)  - the steam bath in the spa is not complimentary anymore for hotel guests and you need to pay a treatment to use it.  - service in the bar majorelle is mediocre    All these little “downgrades” have been hard to digest when you take into account that La Mamounia has never been more expensive than it is now.

La Mamounia Marrakech,M. R. wrote a review Dec 2022,40,A must visit luxury spot,Amazing historical hotel renovated to perfection.  Rooms are quite big and have a lovely balcony where you can admire the sun rising above the city.  Service is kind and attentive and facilities are well kept.  Probably the only black spot is food — passable at the Italian restaurant but really substandard at the Moroccan one… never had such a dry chicken in my life before. Also at the breakfast and lunch buffet over the pool food was quite disappointing.,Date of stay: December 2022,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Hong Kong, China",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/snow_on_the_ocean
La Mamounia Marrakech,fetzerm wrote a review Nov 2022,50,Truly The Best Hotel,La Mamounia is rated the number 1 hotel in the world and deservedly so. The staff makes the hotel. They’re truly amazing and made us feel as if we were much beloved family. Akka a concierge not only went out and bought compression socks for me. He put them on my feet. The hotel itself was gorgeous. Our bed and room were extremely comfortable. We had a view of the hotel gardens and Al Koutubia Mosque from our lavishly furnished and large balcony. All of the restaurants would have been 5 star restaurants anywhere else. The wait staff was excellent. I need to mention Jamal in the Asian restaurant who was truly outstanding as a waiter and also kind and caring. Abdullah a sommelier also was a stand out. The swimming pool was top notch the hammam as well. I wish I had my notes available and could write the names of all of the other staff members who were so wonderful. I imagine La Mamounia is what heaven would be like.,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Ripley, Tennessee",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fetzerm

La Mamounia Marrakech,STEVE R wrote a review Nov 2022,30,Cruise Ship Vibe with Many Pros and Cons,It's a big historic property with large gardens a great pool and fitness center tennis courts and multiple bars and dining options. Reasons to stay include easy walking distance to the Medina and a 10 minute taxi ride from the airport. It's also good for those who need a very familiar setting in a new country. It's easily interchangeable with a luxury cruise ship or the Breakers in Palm Beach. It was last updated in 2007 and the public spaces could use a refresh. It's large number of rooms attract large tour groups (bars and restaurants and lobby have a non-stop supply of large groups with name tags) but also a steady supply of beautiful French tourists who dress up and make great people watching. The large size creates a rushed and not-friendly energy from the staff who chase you down to get you to reserve meals in the hotel and if you book are focused on getting you out of the large restaurants in a hurry. No one asks how your stay is going. The wi-fi service is spotty resulting in constant dropped signals and logging back in. We booked a king suite with pool view. The room was beautifully appointed. We were on the first floor with not much of a promoted Atlas mountain view and also looking mostly at the roof of the Italian restaurant. If you stay in the hotel for drinks or dinner the Asian restaurant had very good food and the Churchill bar was a nice intimate space. Friends recommended the nearby Four Seasons (a little further from the Medina but cabs are inexpensive and always available) or the Royal Monsour - a newer luxury property even closer to the Medina. The Four Seasons rates are less than La Mamounia and the Royal Monsour's are more,Date of stay: November 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K9453BSstever

The staff cannot do enough to assist; the restaurants are world class as is the spa; our room was extremely comfortable and well appointed right down to the mood lighting options; and all the communal areas are outstandingly well appointed luxurious and comfortable.    Our only gripe is that the hotel needs to consider disabled people more. The facilities are insufficient for wheelchair users although the staff did everything in their power to address this. But for a world class hotel it was disappointing. However for the able-bodied the hotel is faultless.,Date of stay: November 2022,,"Hamphire, England",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SimoneP
La Mamounia Marrakech,Holger I wrote a review Nov 2022,10,Bad customer service,We had high expectations of the hotel and stayed in world class hotels before. The hotel itself (lobby pool restaurants etc.) is exceptional. However the room is far below expectations. Very small room in particular the WC. Most annoying is the outside view to a big wall with a set of air conditioners.  At the time of booking (on hotel webside) it was not made clear to us that the room will have zero view.  We tried to change the room immediately however the front desk was very inflexible in finding solutions. We even wanted to leave the hotel earlier because we were so disappointed with the room.  In the end we could not change the room and we could not cancel the hotel room.  We cannot recommend this hotel,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HolgerI23

La Mamounia Marrakech,jw6969 wrote a review Oct 2022,40,Not the best in the World!,This is quite categorically not the best in the World as claimed! However there are many incredible aspects of La Mamounia that are worth mentioning. The lobby and internal areas are absolutely world class - one of a kind and drop dead gorgeous. Our room - 354 - was modest in size but beautifully appointed with a lovely balcony. The pool is fabulous. The staff need training though. I had a number of ‘interactions’ that left me cold. My membership of LHW seemed to be worth nothing (although the free breakfast is absolutely worth having). All I was told on various occasion was “did you book through American Express Travel” - I could have but booked direct for a better rate and superior service. Didn’t get it.

La Mamounia Marrakech,kyia m wrote a review Sep 2022,10,Worst 5 star experience by far,We spent 5 days in a large suite at the hotel with 2 kids and it was horrible. The hotel and the grounds are magnificent but the staff was incompetent and the hotel rules ruined our stay.  1. i arrived with 2 children in a taxi and we weren't allowed inside the gate because taxi's aren't allowed in. so i had to come in by foot with a 4 year old and a one year old. upon check in we were asked to sit and wait for someone to come take our passports 25 minutes later i had to go to the desk and REQUEST immediate help.    2. we were told outside food was not allowed in the hotel including food for my one year old. When we checked out at 7 am breakfast didn't start until 7:30 my kids had to go without breakfast because of this!!    3. bathing suits were no allowed in any of the restaurants around the pool so we had to spend 30 minutes daily bringing the kids back and forth to change for lunch.    4. 3 of the 4 nights we didn't get turn down service. 2 days the room wasn't cleaned until after 3pm. and every single day someone from the hotel came to the room and rang the bell knocked on door or called the phone WHILE the do not disturb button was on.    5. my 4 year old was not allowed in the KIDS CLUB with a bathing suit on.!!!    the hotel is Grande but the worst 5 star hotel ive experienced with kids!! and i reached out to the hotel 6 times before leaving the review with no response even though when i brought these issues up to the guest relations manager she said she would get back to us.,Date of stay: September 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/959kyiam

From the beginning the concierge was very helpful in helping us plan our trips and dinners and we appreciated that very much. The lunch in their cafe and the dinner in the Italian restaurant was superb. The prices are high but then again I guess if you are staying in a 5 start hotel as such expect to pay 9 US$ for cappuccino.

The people working in the hotel have changed we no longer find passionate people like they used to be because there is no longer a service like it was before.

There is no reception. The officials are not qualified for this position because first they do not speak languages and secondly when we asked him about one of the drinks and its ingredients he told us I would inquire about the bartender and this shocked us even more because he did not know anything about the content of his drinks list Unfortunately and with this I invite the hotel management to reconsider how to select the workers,Date of stay: June 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Los Angeles, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Boriszo
La Mamounia Marrakech,Maruzz wrote a review Jun 2022,30,Luxury hotel since 1923 but not luxury standards of 2022,Review after 5 days staying @Mamounia.  Definitely it’s a beautiful place the architecture and greenery is beautiful feel like walking in a palace from Morocco Reign.  When you got such a stunning place no need to make much effort so please I really hope that not only other travelers but especially the management will take into consideration my review.    ROOM SERVICES: there was NO ONE TIME that I could call once the room service and get what requested; indeed I always had to call 2/3/4 times follow up and wait so long (even more than 1h) for simple things like dental kit water coffee capsules.  The housekeeping most intrusive ever found! Even with the do not disturb light and sign outside the door they were coming in!!! Shocking.  Express laundry instead of 3h took almost half a day and they didn’t respect our instructions.  Staff no English speaking seriously???  Are we supposed as guests of awarded hotels to learn the native languages of the hotel line staff otherwise we can’t communicate and therefore being assisted?    FACILITIES: pool nothing special and beds not really comfortable. Gym good with many machines but not all techno gym and old models. Gym staff very good.    SPA: at the time of check in I went to the Spa to book treatments and I was told they were fully book for the whole week. Excuse me? I am hotel guests for 5 days and I cannot have one single treatment in a Spa Hotel?? I went back again the days after and speaking to other receptionist I could book finally a treatment.  The really nice thing of this spa is the original and typical Moroccan architecture but changing room and relaxation room areas not at the standards. Treatments (had a signature facial) ok but nothing to be remembered especially during the treatment the therapist didn’t talk at all while always the therapist explains the products she is applying and the different steps of the treatment.    RESTAURANTS: staff good and kind food not really good. In particular I was disappointed by the breakfast poor choice and a la carte menu only for eggs nothing else.    In general the hotel is also dark and the room also not much lights.  The boutiques are very expensive and don’t accept in room charges; Dior had only the collection of last year and at higher price nothing from the current collection not good.,Date of stay: June 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maruzz

I’m used to the 5 star experience and as a result have very high expectations for where I stay. Excellent service food and accommodations are critical to my needs while traveling for pleasure and la Mammouni well exceeded our expectations.

The hotel has a ton of employees at your disposal to help provide you what you need. It is immaculately kept and the architecture and interior decor is astonishingly beautiful. There are a good number of high end restaurants in the hotel and an indoor/outdoor bar with live music. They have two gyms- and indoor and outdoor one. I only used the outdoor one and they had 4 treadmills weights and yoga mats. They also had a wonderful Pierre Herme store where I bought so many delicious pastries some of the pastries also are part of the breakfast buffet each morning.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Tim R wrote a review Jun 2022,40,5 Star Hotel. 4 Star Guest Relations. 3 Star General Manager,This is a fabulous hotel in the heart of Marrakesh. The hotel is 5 star has excellent restaurants and high end shops within the complex. The buffet brunches particularly on the Sunday are very worthy of eating at.    There are however a few things that guest should be made aware of and staff at La Mamounia can learn from. If like my wife and I in the real world of work/life balance/businesses and kids you know vaguely where you are going I.e Marrakesh and you roughly think l you know the name of the Hotel then you don't have much time researching and googling to death the place you are going too. Then you might not be fully prepared for some of the idiosyncrasies of the hotel. There is a very strict dress code for Men after 6pm and boy did we know about it! What I am about to inform readers of could have and should have been avoided entirely. Everyone when you arriving at reception should be shown around the hotel first & foremost each and every time. Because our room was not ready this did not happen. Essentially if we had of had the tour we hopefully would have been informed of the strict dress code for men after 6pm. So what ensued can only be described as an embarrassing & humiliating episode by La Mamounia members of staff. Pre-dinner drinks on the first night in the famous Le Churchill bar turned into a stern warning by the barman that there is a strict dress code policy and you won't be able to have a drink at the bar. Ok. However you can sit in the lobby outside Le Churchill bar for your drinks. Ok great that works point noted. We were then informed by the very same barman that in-fact you cannot have a drink in the lobby either because other guests may think my dress attire was acceptable and read the same!! My dress attire being a small shirt dress shorts & smart shoes. We then had further embarrassing episode whereby the Le Churchill barman asked us to move again  closer towards the Spa so that we could not be seen!! To cap it all when the drinks finally arrived they were the wrong ones and our taxi for dinner outside of the hotel had arrived. No drinks. The bar lady did however offer a complimentary drink at another time. This did not materialise. First impressions then not good not good at all.    We also had other issues with the hotel regarding changing rooms which we were assured would be taken care of and were not. Plus when trying to sleep in outdoor workforce power washing the patio and windows whilst the room curtains were drawn (clue) which woke us both up. There was also inconsistencies regarding consumable products in the hotel room. Some days the consumables were replenished and some days they were not. A 5 star note should not have this problem.    When talking to guest relations upon checkout although our concerns were raised heard and apologised for the General Manager who ultimately had to make the decisions was unprepared to make any concessions. So anyone considering staying at this lovely hotel my advise is this if you have any issues that need addressing during your stay speak to guest relations as these happen and do not leave any issues with the hotel until checking out.,Date of stay: June 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Poole, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/130timr

La Mamounia Marrakech,streatleygirl wrote a review Jun 2022,50,Now we know why it has been named best hotel in the world...,We had very high expectations prior to this trip and I am so pleased that La Mamounia rose to every challenge we gave them! The pre-arrival information from the concierge the reservations team and the spa was very helpful. The fast track through the airport was great as was the hotel transfer service. On arrival in the hotel you cannot but be impressed. Inside it is very dark and cool and outside it’s a lush tropical garden with fountains patios and the most amazing pool where the Murano glass floor makes it like looking into a pool of diamonds. Make sure you make time to walk around the amazing walled garden you will see the turtles and the kitchen garden and some amazing cacti.  I have to single out two front of house staff who went above and beyond to make our stay the experience we had hoped for (this was our 3rd attempt to celebrate a special birthday – first 2 thwarted by covid). On arrival we were met by Laila our room wasn’t ready (ok we know check in is at 3pm but it’s always a lovely touch when they know you are arriving earlier to go straight to the room) but Laila went to see how quickly it could be made ready and promised to call me as soon as it was. True to word less than an hour later and she found us on the patio and took us to the room. We had booked a deluxe Koutoubia room just a word about room choice – had I studied the map a little more carefully I would have noticed the main road that separates the hotel from the Koutoubia Mosque. So if you are after the hustle and bustle of the city with views of the mosque this is a good choice for you. We wanted peace and quiet so asked to move. We met with the front of house manager Kenza and I can only say what a truly lovely person she is empathetic and professional. She really did go the extra mile and managed not only to move us the next day but to upgrade us to a suite near the pool. Thank you Kenza we really appreciated that.  Recommendations for dinner every evening from the concierge were great we went to La Palace (our favourite) Comptoir Darna (great fun) La Sultana (very close second favourite) and El Fenn (not great food but good roof top location). Also very helpful was to hear that taxi rides in the city by day are 50 dirhams and at night 90 dirhams so we went round with a wadge of 100 dirhams notes (about £8) waved one of these to the taxi driver and never had a problem they were all lovely one gave us his card where it might have been difficult to find a taxi to pick up and the restaurant called him and he was there in minutes. We walked to La Palace and again the walk was not difficult lots of very helpful police on bikes everywhere. We also ate in the Italian in the hotel that wasn’t great to be honest we had the steak to share and it was very fatty and full of gristle – we left most of it the waiters looked at it and shrugged… suffice to say you do better to eat at the local recommended restaurants.  Marrakesh is an amazing place we have already booked our return flights. La Mamounia was a “once in a lifetime” trip but once you have stayed there it would be very difficult to stay anywhere else! So La Mamounia thank you for an amazing stay and for sure next May we are coming back!

We had booked a deluxe Koutoubia room just a word about room choice – had I studied the map a little more carefully I would have noticed the main road that separates the hotel from the Koutoubia Mosque. So if you are after the hustle and bustle of the city with views of the mosque this is a good choice for you. We wanted peace and quiet so asked to move. We met with the front of house manager Kenza and I can only say what a truly lovely person she is empathetic and professional. She really did go the extra mile and managed not only to move us the next day but to upgrade us to a suite near the pool. Thank you Kenza we really appreciated that.  Recommendations for dinner every evening from the concierge were great we went to La Palace (our favourite) Comptoir Darna (great fun) La Sultana (very close second favourite) and El Fenn (not great food but good roof top location). Also very helpful was to hear that taxi rides in the city by day are 50 dirhams and at night 90 dirhams so we went round with a wadge of 100 dirhams notes (about £8) waved one of these to the taxi driver and never had a problem they were all lovely one gave us his card where it might have been difficult to find a taxi to pick up and the restaurant called him and he was there in minutes. We walked to La Palace and again the walk was not difficult lots of very helpful police on bikes everywhere. We also ate in the Italian in the hotel that wasn’t great to be honest we had the steak to share and it was very fatty and full of gristle – we left most of it the waiters looked at it and shrugged… suffice to say you do better to eat at the local recommended restaurants.  Marrakesh is an amazing place we have already booked our return flights. La Mamounia was a “once in a lifetime” trip but once you have stayed there it would be very difficult to stay anywhere else! So La Mamounia thank you for an amazing stay and for sure next May we are coming back!

La Mamounia Marrakech,Carlo R wrote a review Apr 2022,40,World-class hotel with a few issues to sort out,The Mamounia is a beautiful hotel with first-class rooms public areas and gardens. That part of the hotel is truly world-class. The housekeeping service is also efficient and unbtrusive. It's only a ten-minute transfer to the airport and a fifteen-minute walk to the medina. Overall it's a great experience but the food and beverage department could do with some improvement.    When you check in to a hotel like the Mamounia you can’t complain about the prices of drinks meals and spa treatments - they’re going to be expensive. But you can expect perfect service and a generosity of spirit and I was really impressed at how they reacted to the few issues I had during my stay. I really came away feeling that they care about their guests.    The poor quality of their coffee was the thing I noticed the most. Whether a cappuccino at breakfast or coffee from the bar all the coffee I had at the hotel was really terrible I think delivered by a really cheap press-button machine. I think they also need to sort out a residents-only snack-bar at the pool where guests can eat a light lunch in the shade. Also the quality of the food in the Italian restaurant was poor with the lovely wood-fired pizza oven wasted. The ice-cream bar in the middle of the gardens is also poor.    But these were minor issues overall. We stayed five nights and would love to return. This really is a world-class hotel.,Date of stay: April 2022,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carlovrimini

La Mamounia Marrakech,THE TRAVELLER wrote a review Apr 2022,50,Just beautiful !,This is a legendary hotel and is world class. The building has has a great history and has been very sympathetically brought up to date to standards of the modern day traveller. Decor is beautiful. Staff are delightful and exceeded my expectations even in a luxury hotel. They are always there when you need them and seem to disappear into the woodwork when you do not! Excellent choice of different styles of dining here. The grounds are magnificent. The bedrooms large and extremely comfortable with several different grades available. The only downside?- Well for me the price! I would love to have stayed here longer- we were on a short break from Agadir.

La Mamounia Marrakech,RomanoBellini wrote a review Apr 2022,50,Great Fun and Location,It was an excellent experience at this resort from the beginning to the end. The service is spectacular. Whatever you need or want they are there to get it done for you. One small example... I wanted to break some money into smaller bills and the usual person who did it was not at the desk. One of the ladies took the money and went to a bank/exchange place near-by and made the exchange.    Breakfast buffet service was very attentive and just fun looking out at the beautiful pool. My one complaint is there is always someone posted at the pool that kept asking us if we were residents.    The grounds are just beautiful and it is nice to walk around the paths and admire the plants. The resort is quite spectacular at night.    Our room had a nice view and we used the balcony quite often. The bed was very comfortable. One suggestion is the room should have a lower mirror or one that goes high -to- low. My wife wanted to blow dry her hair in the bedroom so she had to stand on a chair. The mirror was just too high for anything.    I liked that the bathroom had two towel warmers. We got caught in the rain one time and it was nice to have those clothes dried off by the next day. The bathroom amenities were ok.    They kept it well stocked with bottled water and you got a fresh date daily.    The location is about a 10 minute walk to the main square of the Medina. The hotel also did a good job of warning us that people will say they work at the hotel and remember us and they can show us where to go. This can lead to being forced to pay for a service if you don't nip it in the bud. They will leave you alone once you tell the you know where you are heading.    The taxi drivers at the nearby taxi stand are good at gouging because of their location and seem to have a set fee of 100 MAD for a ride that should be 30 MAD. You get a better price if you hail one in the street or one that just dropped off.    We did not sample the restaurants after we had our first dinner at the Italian restaurant. We felt the prices were high and there was no shortage of restaurants nearby or a short 30 MAD taxi ride away.    You are to wear a mask inside the buildings but as often is the case some choose not to. We did wear masks.    I look back fondly on our stay there. Eight nights of superlative service.,Date of stay: March 2022,,"Toronto, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RomanoBellini

La Mamounia Marrakech,Leathers wrote a review Jul 2021,50,L'Asiatique by Jean-Georges - a stunning addition to Marrakech's dining scene,Excellent lunch at the new Asian restaurant (L'Asiatique by Jean Georges) at La Mamounia. Overjoyed to have dined at the new Asian restaurant at La Mamounia. Positioned on the site of the previous Italian restaurant decor has been modernised with a updated minimalistic (possibly Japanese inspired) atmosphere yet managing to retain an opulence unique to La Mamounia. Menu is expansive - including sushi dim sum and even some extremely well executed Thai classics.  Every single dish (including generously proportioned sides) was excellent. Highly recommended. We visited with two children (there is a sensible children's menu) and despite the rarefied atmosphere the staff couldn't have been more accommodating or attentive.  Looking forward to our next visit.,Date of stay: June 2021,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scarlett_Stirling

The hotel is incredibly COVID safe and the staff have definitely used this downtime to engage in training I felt well looked after at all times. I would personally like to thank Caroline Head of Guest Services for introducing herself and to have her team note my preferences. I would like to personally thank Radouane from Guest Services Abdullah from night room service the charming young waiter who opened the Italian restaurant for me to have lunch and Billa Naciri and Abduljalil the tennis coaches for excellent sessions.,Date of stay: June 2021,Trip type: Traveled on business,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GentlemanNomad

La Mamounia Marrakech,Dov K wrote a review Feb 2021,50,"La Mamounia ""The Palace Extraordinaire"" synonymous with Marrakech",La Mamounia is a palace hotel which is a stunning blend of gorgeous Moroccan architecture and design together with elegant interiors magnificent mature gardens and immaculate service. Every inch of this palatial-like property has been hyper-considered to make you feel as though arrived in some regal estate of an Arabian kingdom. You get awestruck with feeling how this palace hotel has been styled with handcrafted Moorish opulence. It is the essence of true luxury!    Management & Team  As a Hotelier myself with 40+ years’ experience everything starts with Management! They are exceptional to say the least and worth every penny if not more! The Management and Team will stop at nothing to ensure all your needs and desires are met during your stay giving much prestige to the La Mamounia label they do not miss an inch. I salute them! Truly 5-star excellence!    Guest Relations  Although the load factor is low due to COVID nothing is sparred with relation to obtaining the high-end luxury at the La Mamounia. The grounds are magnificently kept with gardens surround. It is a true paradise.    Service  The service is most impressive from all involved; from the GM Sales Front Desk Wait Staff Maitre De and Bellman. All are fully involved in the success of the Hotel and are very happy to try and accommodate all requests. Everyone from right at the entrance and lovely staff welcoming you on arrival offering assistance with your luggage to the wait staff and room upkeep staff are committed to exceed your expectations with their genuine and discreet service that defines signature La Mamounia Luxury. The hospitality of the Management and staff is “Outstanding”.    Location  The hotel has a great location with breath taking views. The entrance with the narrow hallways entering the suite is unlike any other resembling the ultimate in luxury. Very close within walking distance to the medina.    Bar/Dining  The Bartenders are very knowledgeable and friendly. The service for breakfast and world class dining is outstanding from the Maitre D to the wait staff. They are eager to please trying to accommodate even personal choice requests with a “Special Touch” and elegant silverware to boot. The Italian and Asian cuisine is detectible and a must visit even if only to visit for brunch or an afternoon/evening aperitif.    Accessibility/Transportation/Parking  Transportation is a breeze as they offer very professional transportation options to include day trips etc. Parking is quite easy as you have your own private space for your vehicle at your villa. There is a private tunnel allowing for easy access directly to the main building.    Accommodations  Villas are exquisitely decorated with the finest. High ceilings luxury bedding and linens. Bathrooms are equipped with all amenities and richness. The balconies give the warmth and feeling as if you are in your own private exclusive estate.    Pool/Spa/Gym  The pools are spectacular some with magnificent views almost picture perfect. The Spa has a great team which is professionally staffed with very high standards including a Turkish Hammam (steam room) and a variety of specialty treatment therapies. The Gym is state of the art and the attendants are uniquely friendly and impressive.    Overall  I highly recommend and salute La Mamounia as a place to relax and unwind. This hotel offers the highest level of service with a great value for those who choose to visit Marrakech. It is a must visit to enjoy and experience the distinct “TASTE of LUXURY”! Do not miss trying to stay at the best of the best to experience the “Royal Opulence” and “Exquisite Cuisine”.,Date of stay: February 2021,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Miami, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D0vK

As you walk through the hotel it is very dark after being out in the sun. The hotel is due to close for a few months for renovations. We said we wanted to visit the gardens and have refreshments too. No problem at all. The mint tea was great and it came with 3 types of sweet meats. Hot chocolate great too but naturally expensive. The gardens are exceptionally well kept with a very good lay out with wide pathways. The vegetable garden was good too with broadbeans and a large herb garden and polytunnels. The most quirky parts were the red plastic cacti amongst the real cacti.,Date of stay: February 2020,,"Grantham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donnison44
La Mamounia Marrakech,Erika Puspa wrote a review Feb 2020,50,Great Gatsby Moment!!,We stayed at La Mamounia for couple of days during our visit in Marrakech. Overall it was a nice experience but with mixed feelings.    Our room was spacious enough clean and comfortable we had good sleep during our stay. Room lighting needs improvement just too dark for me and the switches were not easy to use. Also as other reviewers mentioned we had slightly problems on where to put our luggages.    The hotel design and architecture are beautiful Moorish style and somehow I got the ‘great gatsby‘ feeling. Overall ambiance inside the hotel was just too dark for me and again need lighting improvement. Also anywhere in the hotel I felt too crowded. As the hotel had many visitors I felt like being watched by the hotel security staff (but not in a nice and secured ways). I understand that was for security reasons but it made us felt uncomfortable as hotel staying guest not welcoming (prior to our stay we had stayed for couple of days at Amanjena which was very tranquil and peaceful - so totally a different experience). The hotel grounds are amazing beautiful and well kept.    Breakfast options were superb and we had tried the Italian and Moroccan restaurants for dinner - the foods were very good but the service in breakfast room and Italian restaurant need some improvement. During our breakfast we had to ask many times for our food orders as well as our cutleries. I understand it was super busy days during our stay as Netflix crew was also there but other hotel guests needed also to be professionally served and looked after. At Italian dinner 2 restaurant staff had an argument to each other while we were about to leave the table as one of them tried to ‘take’ the tip we left on our table. Dinner at Moroccan restaurant was super the food the staff and the live traditional music - totally a different experience from breakfast and Italian restaurants.    We tried the spa (hammam and massage) and it was amazing and relaxing! We did also book the camel rides from the hotel and what an awesome experience.,Date of stay: February 2020,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Brussels, Belgium",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erikapX4316NY

When we checked in I realized right away that we didn't have a balcony in our room and we had booked a room with a balcony. I let the staff know and they immediately moved us into an even nicer room than what was originally booked on the top floor with views of the city and garden. We were also celebrating my boyfriend's birthday and they so generously had a cake and champagne in the room for us upon checking in. The spa is one of a kind and I highly recommend it.

La Mamounia Marrakech,kalliopi21 wrote a review Feb 2020,10,APPALLING BEHAVIOUR!,During our recent visit to Marrakech we decided to check out two of the best hotels (as we had heard) in order to stay next time (we had preferred a traditional riad in the old city this time). On arriving at LA MAMOUNIA instead of being treated as guests should be treated- we wanted to have coffee and dessert- we had a shocking treatment appalling I would say! At the gate a guard asked me to wear my jacket to get in- I had it round my waste as it was hot and we had been walking. My hand-bag is a black medium-sized back pack where I keep all my valuables. Another employee came and they told me that I had to leave it in a small room next to the gate. I put on my jacket and when I protested about my bag (that I had my money passport cards medicine glasses etc.) and I had to take it with me they became quite rude and told me it was hotel policy. They wouldn’t let us in and I got really angry and raised my voice because they were treating us as though we were beggars asking for money. As though we were the lowest of the low (in our days imagine!). The guard was looking at me without speaking or doing anything for that matter. That was even worse! Their attitude was very offensive and humiliating towards us. I would have left right away but as we were with friends and tired I agreed to go in doing everything they had ordered me to do! We went to the gardens but as there were no free tables for us??? (Someone had warned them?? I don’t know) we left quite relieved on my part I must say. I didn’t want to stay there and give them my money after all that! During the incident a girl passed us by and went in with her jacket round her waist and a bigger back pack!!!!!!!!! Maybe they let her in because she was staying there. But that is not how a visitor should be treated if you want to call yourself a luxury hotel of ….. stars!!! In a nut shell when visiting the beautiful city of Marrakech I would not recommend you staying there let alone going for a meal or coffee….They might even arrest you who knows!!! And imagine I have the means to stay in such a hotel and have been to much…much better ones around the world! Last but not least… just to make the comparison…before going to MAMOUNIA we had visited Hotel Royal Mansour Marrakech. I went the same way but no one told me a thing. We were treated in the most polite way exactly as they treat guests staying at the hotel. No discrimination!!!!!!!!!!!! whatsoever. As it should be! We had lunch and I must say it’s a wonderful hotel. We loved it. The hotel itself the ambiance the people…Excellent from all points of view. Next time we will stay there! So much more elegant and truly luxurious than the decadent one!,Date of stay: January 2020,,"Athens, Greece",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kalliopi21

La Mamounia Marrakech,travel-blablabla wrote a review Jan 2020,50,Extraordinary place but ...,I could not make a choice and had to split my stay between several hotels.  Generally I am impressed in particular with the beautiful gardens and restaurants. I really enjoyed the outdoor heated pool (majority of 5* have heated pools in winter). One thing about the hotel is that rooms etc are quite dark it is part of the hotel atmosphere.  Location is great - v close to the beautiful Koutoubia mosque. Many interesting places are walking distance.  There is a great choice of excellent restaurants (in some cases residents are not obliged to have a full set menu) and both the food service and the places are excellent.  But ...  I agree with other reviews that there is a problem with the amount of people in the hotel - there are lots of ‘security guards’ (and I mean security guards ie a bit unfriendly!) and it is not clear how they make a difference between residents and other guests who mainly visit the bars/restaurants/luxury shops.

Often we saw couples young and old using flashlights or their cell phones to read the menus.

La Mamounia gets a lot of visitors to its beautiful grounds and spa so I think the staff is accustomed to fending people off. During our two-night stay we would frequently get treated rudely until we clarified that we were hotel guests. For example we missed ten minutes of our pre-booked spa treatment because the receptionist insisted that we had to pay in advance despite our reservation (and the fact that she could have just charged it to our room).    We spent our last night at Royal Mansour and the contrast was like night and day.,Date of stay: December 2019,,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacquelineny
La Mamounia Marrakech,Lorenzen101 wrote a review Jan 2020,10,The most horrible 5 star hotel experience I've ever had,"If La Mamounia claims to be a symbol of traditional Moroccan hospitality then that's pretty sad as my experience staying there for 2 nights was just horrifying and not relaxing at all and here is why:    We arrived to our room (escorted by our personal check in bell boy) and the room stank the counter tops were sticky and after we opened the door to the mini bar we understood why. The fridge was overheating and a bottle of Coca Cola had exploded and clearly no one had been in the room for days. After calling the manager the fridge got replaced but nothing was cleaned so we ""slept"" (see next note) in a sticky smelly room for a night.    We asked for a quiet room when we booked the room but after a sleepless night we found out that we're placed right above the service area that operates 24/7!!! After complaining to the manager all we got was ""sorry we're booked"" but we knew by looking online that they had rooms available (by the way our room was $750/night).    Overall we didn't feel welcome by the staff or the security guards (who are in every corner of the hotel asking us where we where going). Don't waste your money on staying at the La Mamounia but rather book a Riad where you'll feel more welcome in an intimate setting. We left the La Mamounia after 2 nights of hell and then stayed at Dar Rhizlane which was just amazing and the staff was so kind.",Date of stay: December 2019,,New York,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lorenzen101

When we entered La Mamounia the intoxicating scent of orange blossom was undeniably encompassing but also just subtle enough for a refreshing tone. “It is our signature orange blossom essence” explained our greeter at reception which they subtly disperse through the vents throughout the interior of the hotel mirroring the scent that fills the streets of Marrakech seasonally when they are in full bloom. We were escorted to a plush seating area to await our host for check-in and were pleasantly surprised with an arrival offering of traditional dates and a sweet and creamy drink with lavender tones.

La Mamounia Marrakech,wanderlustCTC wrote a review Jan 2020,40,A VERY Detailed La Mamounia Review!,I’m taking the time to write a very thorough and well-rounded review of La Mamounia for potential guests and I am basing it on the cost & experience at this property versus other 5 star resorts around the world. Also keep in mind- La Mamounia was crowned as the “Best Hotel in the World” by Condé Nast in 2018. These are some pretty epic shoes to fill so I’m going to recap our experience weighing such a coveted title. I also hope that La Mamounia may read this review to see where some potential improvements can be made. I’ll start by saying that there are many EXCELLENT things about La Mamounia but there are also some FRUSTRATING things about La Mamounia too. I’ll start with the not-so-good in order for us to end on a high note. :) Please don’t just read the first half of this review... Read the second half as well because ultimately La Mamounia was charming and we certainly enjoyed our stay. Keep in mind I may be harsh and tedious at times throughout this review but again this is a VERY expensive 5 star hotel with perhaps the most prestigious accolade in the world. Therefore I feel you should expect to receive the best of the best in ALL resort categories- not just SOME of the resort categories. Without further ado let’s begin.    THE NEGATIVES:    1) On the La Mamounia website we looked at the many different rooms offered and decided to book a “Superior” Room. This is a step up from the “Classic” Room. On the website there are two very different photos of these two room types with different wall color schemes different headboards/furniture and a different room layout. Therefore there is NO confusion between the ways these two rooms look (at least according to their own website and the many real-life photos/reviews from TripAdvisor visitors and beyond). Upon arrival we noticed that our room looked EXACTLY like the “Classic” room advertised on their website. Additionally I checked TripAdvisor and several other websites/blog reviews once more and again the “Classic” room photos matched our room exactly. We asked the staff why we were put in this room when we paid for the Superior room. They answered by saying we were in fact in a Superior room. I asked them several times how this could be true when the photos on their own website show a completely different wall color furniture bed and room setup/design with two hallways instead of one in a Superior room. They answered this by saying “no ma’am you are in a Superior room”. I am still very bothered by this. Either La Mamounia wasn’t telling us the truth OR their website is showing false advertisements on the room types. Again all of the rooms are gorgeous in La Mamounia (albeit some are very small) but if you are paying top dollar for a very specific room type and you are instead put in a room that is advertised as a less expensive room than you purchased something is not right. If La Mamounia has converted some of their “Classic” rooms to “Superior” rooms then they need to update this information on their website ASAP or change the photos that illustrate what these are rooms are expected to look like. My husband and I are still very confused about all of this and continue to wonder if we paid for a room that we didn’t receive.    2) Let’s talk room design (and again I don’t know if this is the way a Superior room is set up or the way a Classic room is set up because see above). This hotel room was GORGEOUS but very very small and unfortunately not functional. For starters there is no full length mirror anywhere in the hotel room and the only mirror hanging in the bedroom area is very very high (as in you would have to move a large chair so that you could stand on it in order to even see your face in the mirror). This means 2 people must get dressed and ready in the tiny bathroom at the same time. Here is where the problem begins. The shower is a wide-open concept directly next to the sink and bathroom mirror. Water pours from the shower onto the floor and beyond and the bathroom gets extremely steamy & wet (even with all of the doors open/fans on). Therefore it is impossible for one person to shower while the other person is getting groomed and ready (unless you want to look like you fixed your hair or put on makeup inside of a wet sauna). If you are two travelers pressed for time and want to sight-see as much as possible this is a frustrating issue to deal with- especially for a top tier 5 star hotel. All in all the small bathroom design is “pretty” but very problematic and totally not functional.    -There is minimal space for luggage (especially if you have the type of luggage that must fold out like a book) and the closet is extremely tiny to hang clothes or keep shoes. Our luggage ended up being laid all over the floor in the bedroom like playing hop scotch to walk around lol and our shoes were sitting in random spots all throughout the hallway.    -Now onto the bedroom itself... There are no USB outlets near the bed to charge your phone/electronics (which is honestly no big deal at all). But the plug outlet situation near the bed is a problem. The plug outlet is placed so close to the floor that you can only plug in a very basic SMALL type C plug with ease. This means that any rectangular or odd shaped plugs (like many chargers/adapters/converters are shaped) will not fit into the outlet even if you try to turn it upside down. This poses an issue especially for international travelers and it limits (or totally eliminates) the ability to plug in what you need to where you need to. We ended up having to plug most of our electronics on the other side of the room that fit with our international plug adapters and power banks. Again I know I am sounding very particular here but these are modern necessities we have all come to expect (as in the freedom of plugging whatever electronics you need to by your nightstand).    -There are so many tiny dimmable brass light switches in the hotel room that you are constantly trying to figure out what little switch turns on what light. This allows for many levels of ambient lighting (which is awesome) but it is also quite problematic especially in the late evening. So say for instance you are trying to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night- you have to walk thru a pitch black hallway (the hallway in the hotel room is VERY dark like an actual cave and it has absolutely no outside light pouring in). It is so dark that you start trying to figure out how to turn on some lights (or where the light switches are even located) and the tricky thing is that some of the light switches are actually labeled as “Service” bells that you don’t want to touch. And the only way to turn on the hallway light is to turn on the MASTER light switch at the end of the L-shaped hallway next to the hotel room door. The issue with this is that the master light switch turns on ALL of the hotel lights at once not just the hallway light which could easily wake up whomever is sleeping. Some of you may think “well just use your cell phone to light the way”. But remember we had to plug most of our electronics on the other side of the room.... :D We ended up keeping all of the bathroom lights on at full brightness every night in order to have some type of visibility if needing a late night bathroom break.    -One quick note on the lighting that some of you may want to come prepared for: The room we stayed in was very dark with zero sunlight pouring into the bathroom closet or hallways. The walls are a deep maroon color and the lights aren’t very bright. So if you are the type of woman (or man) that likes to do your makeup or hair in bright/natural lighting most definitely bring some type of travel vanity mirror with you.    -The A/C controller is located behind a desk and floor lamp. They quickly point this out when you are going through the initial room tour but it can become a detail you easily forget (especially if you have been traveling for hours/days just to get to Marrakech). The first night we were here I woke up freezing so I was stumbling around with no light to find where the A/C unit was located. After making a bunch of noise figuring out which light switches to use and getting frustrated at not finding the unit after several minutes of hopelessly searching my husband finally woke up and groggily told me to look somewhere behind the desk/floor lamp area. I then had to turn on the big overhead lights to physically move the floor lamp so that I could change the A/C setting. As I said these are ALL somewhat small details- but at this day in age when you are staying in a hotel (especially a VERY expensive 5 star hotel) these everyday tasks should be seamless thoughtless and very easy to accomplish. If you’re reading this thinking “wow- she’s being extra picky” just remember that we are all used to being able to do these otherwise effortless tasks with ease in 2020... I.E. quickly locating power outlets charging devices close to our bed easily controlling the A/C (without having to move furniture to reach it) having an actual dry space to get ready with a mirror if the bathroom is wet/steamed up while someone else is showering or having a full length mirror located at least somewhere in the room etc. I heard that La Mamounia is closing their doors in May of 2020 for some renovations. I hope they take these types of issues into consideration. A room doesn’t simply need to be beautiful- it also needs to be FUNCTIONAL! Overlooking small user-experience details like these can make easy everyday tasks become absurdly frustrating and I would say this was by far the biggest issue throughout our stay.    The SO-SO’s Hmmmmm MOMENTS AND RANDOM TIDBITS TO KNOW:    -Most of the service we received was either exceptional or at least what we would consider to be pretty good but there were a few hit or misses. Some of the hotel staff are extremely friendly while others are meh and not looking to be bothered. One thing I noticed is that you are constantly being asked to show your room key to prove you are a resident at the hotel. For instance I asked one of the staff if I could go take some photos in “THE” white and black corridor you see photographed all over Instagram (yeah I know I was being super basic ha!). But instead of the staff saying “Absolutely you can as long as you are a resident” I was told “No- that room is only for residents”. But ummmm.... I was a resident? I could maybe understand if I was walking around super underdressed or confused like I didn’t belong in La Mamounia but for God’s sake I had on heels a fedora and frickin’ Gucci. Lol! Which is completely beside the point (it should NOT matter what you look like or what you’re wearing- period!) but... the main point is this: I understand La Mamounia probably gets thousands of guests per week trying to take property photos as visitors and not paying residents but I feel that the staff should not automatically ASSUME that you aren’t a resident to begin with. This type of treatment happened a couple of times with us and my husband and I were (at moments) a little bewildered. I think we summed it up best by saying in one conversation “La Mamounia seems to act as if it is a privilege for you to stay at their hotel- not that it is privilege to serve you as a paying guest.”    I will add that in this particular instance the staff member certainly redeemed himself once I was able to show him that we were residents and he even offered to take photos of my husband and I together in the corridor. We were very appreciative of his patience and he turned out being a great help to us- so in the end thank you so much for your kindness!    -Check the lunch buffet prices before you go unlike we stupidly did not do. LOL! On our first full day at La Mamounia we slept very late due to the extensive traveling to get to Marrakech the day before therefore we missed the breakfast buffet included with our stay. No problem we thought.... We’ll just grab the quickest-option (the lunch buffet) and then start our sight seeing adventure. It was definitely our fault for not checking the price of the lunch buffet beforehand but we ate very lightly (more of like a snack than a lunch) and both had one glass up champagne; this resulted in a $250 USD lunch. For a buffet and a glass of champagne... Haha! Again TOTALLY our fault for not asking beforehand. But just make sure that you either A) want to eat a big hearty meal for lunch or that you are B) just rolling in all kinds of cash to blow when perusing the buffet as a quick dining option. Lol.    THE EXCELLENT:    -La Mamounia is absolutely STUNNING. Obviously everyone knows this if you are considering staying here but photos really don’t do it justice. This property is in a league of its own. I wouldn’t consider it 5 star... I’d consider it more like 7 star. The architecture is mind-blowing and the intricacy of detail is unbelievable. The property itself is huge- the gardens are never ending- and there are several dining options. Additionally there are many high end shoppes like Yves Saint Laurent and Dior if you need to do some splurge shopping. They even have the most adorable outdoor flower shop and a darling ice cream cart serving up sweet treats in the garden. There are also SO many areas to take unbelievably gorgeous photos that you could literally spend days photographing every square foot of this property. It is just that gorgeous. While sitting on one of the many back garden patios during a brilliantly sunny day you feel like you are living in a fairytale. I’ve been to a lot of hotels all around the world and I don’t hesitate in saying that the splendor of this hotel is unmatched. The only other property I’ve stayed in with such fantastic intricacy in detail is located in Bali- but Bali also has an unbelievable amount of natural beauty to help out with this. La Mamounia was all man-made to my knowledge and let me tell you every inch of it is spectacular.    -All of the food we ate at La Mamounia was absolutely delicious. Every restaurant. Every bar. Every room service order. Every breakfast buffet- it was all top notch every single time. I give huge props to La Mamounia for insuring their dining experiences are all fantastic.    -Some of the staff in La Mamounia absolutely blew us away with their level of service. The friendliest bunch were the bellmen and the transportation services. They treat you like royalty and they are so incredibly helpful. When La Mamounia booked us transportation back to the airport on our last day our driver was the most exceptional person we experienced at La Mamounia. He told us “At La Mamounia we don’t believe your journey ends at the airport door- we believe it ends when you get on the plane.” This simply blew us away. He proceeded to roll our bags through the first security check waited in the very long line at the check-in desk with us and loaded all of our bags to be tagged and weighed and then he walked us all the way to the final security checkpoint at which only air travelers were allowed. We didn’t ask him to do any of this for us; in fact I felt bad he was doing it and I told him that he certainly didn’t have to continue helping us. But he did it with a smile and we were so unbelievably appreciative. International airports in countries that you have never been to before can be a little daunting but he guided us with ease and made our entire airport experience completely seamless. We have never received such a high level of service with any other 5 star resort. La Mamounia knocked this one out of the park. To the kind driver who helped us that day- Thank you thank you.    -The majority of staff members were friendly and willing to help you at any time. Our restaurant servers were exceptionally kind warm and conversational. We enjoyed meeting several of the waiters here and it was charming to have such interesting conversations with these locals. Special shout out to the man who waited on us one evening in their Italian restaurant and the bartender who served us cocktails on the Moroccan terrace overlooking the gardens. You were both so lovely!    -When staying at such an overwhelming city for the senses (the medina in Marrakech is a LOT to handle) it was always so comforting and refreshing to return to La Mamounia in the evenings. I believe the word Mamounia means “safe haven” in another language (I could be wrong though!) abut we definitely felt like we had our safe haven in Marrakech. It wasn’t only a safe haven for us but a spectacular fairytale world of its own. My dream since I was a small child was to one day go to Morocco and ride a camel in the Sahara desert and then wander the souks of Marrakech to see all of the splendid fabrics rugs and lamps. I was definitely able to achieve all of this during our tour through Morocco and I’ll always fondly look back on our time at La Mamounia in Marrakech. We wouldn’t have wanted to stay anywhere else and I am thankful for the memories we made here. Thank you La Mamounia for creating such a beautiful place to escape to in a city that never sleeps- One day I hope that we will be able to come back!,Date of stay: January 2020,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,United States,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wanderlustCTC
La Mamounia Marrakech,NK1990 wrote a review Jan 2020,20,Beautiful Grounds...Terrible Service,My husband and I came to visit La Mamounia - both to shop at the luxury boutiques and to have a few drinks. My first observation was the feeling of judgement from all the staff even starting with the security guards. It felt like service was given based on what they deemed to be your 'position' (level of wealth). My husband and I were not in sweatpants either...we dressed nicely for the day having planned both a visit to the Majorelle Gardens and luxury shopping around La Mamounia. While passing through security they insisted we check in our bags and when we asked why we were told it was because this was a very important special hotel and it was to protect the people staying there. I am not opposed to checking in my things but being told that they were protecting those staying there made us feel like we were unwanted visitors.    When we went to some of the luxury stores both Dior and Saint Laurent we were relatively ignored while some others that walked in after us received attention. When we got to the bar area and asked to sit outside we were told they were completely booked outside as we looked out at over 10 tables that were open...when we inquired they said they were reserved....we watched as many families / couples tried the same and got rejected while others that strolled in were welcomed. We were escorted to a lounge area and then ensued two frustrating and amusing hours of trying to wave down waiters many of whom ignored not just us but many many people around us. We watched as many people got frustrated and left. Those who succeeded in getting a drink were those like us that watched like hawks for a waiter and vigorously tried to wave them down. There were lots of waiters around so we like most around us were confused as to why we were being ignored.    The cherry on top was returning to find coffee spilled all over our backpack and shopping bag that we were forced to check in at security. The worst part of this was that the security guards didn't actually say anything as they handed us the items...as we were stepping back to leave we noticed the coffee stain on our shopping bag and the security guard blamed it on a child that ran into the area where things were stored. What I found appalling was that the blame was being passed on a child...instead of taking responsibility for not securing and watching the area they were tasked to protect. My husband then noticed coffee all over his backpack and a strong stench.    At this point we went to the front desk to complain. The manager was initially offputting saying that he cannot confirm or deny if his staff did it or someone else. Again for a LUXURY hotel it is ridiculous that they cannot even handle this sort of conversation with sensitivity enough to just apologize for the 'mishap' and lack of attention. Luckily the manager finally offered to clean and deliver our items to us the next day.    The items luckily returned the next day to us but the backpack still smelled of coffee.    Overall I would say this was a pretty overrated hotel for lack of service delivered. Other reviews on this site seem to clearly state that as well. I will say that grounds were stunning the building was stunning and the location was a great one to the medina. Save your money though and grab less-overpriced drinks elsewhere.,Date of stay: December 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/77nikhi
La Mamounia Marrakech,Ольга Ж wrote a review Jan 2020,50,Restaurant,We have visited restaurant in January 2020. And the dinner was the best in our life.  Our experience starts from booking the table. We had asked the concierge in our Riad to book the table for dinner and he had confirmed it in the evening. But when we came to the La Mamonia we couldn’t find any reservation in three restaurants. After our discussion with the La Mamonia concierge they finally could manage the table for us. And it was the best crevice ever.

La Mamounia Marrakech,kunster86 wrote a review Jan 2020,30,Average Property,Please be aware that my review will come off as a bit “harsh” but keep in mind that I’m evaluating this property against other 5 star chains around the world such as the Four Seasons Ritz and St. Regis.    Overall the property is very aesthetically pleasing with its plush gardens and antique palace charm. Easiest way to describe it is as a posh country club in Marrakech. The highlight of the property is the poolside breakfast with the vast assortment of pastries and the various high end luxury boutiques within the lobby.    From a pricing perspective the hotel is terribly overpriced. For the value of the room which was extremely tiny to the price of food in the restaurants I was dumbfounded. Originally I had considered staying at the Four Seasons but a colleague convinced me to give this property a try. I did dine at the Four Seasons one night and the cost of the restaurant there was almost half the cost of even the cafe at La Mamounia for similar quality food.    The staff as the property were mixed in terms of friendliness and going above and beyond. Unfortunately more often then not I felt the staff judged you based on if you were a higher profile guest or if it appeared you were of wealth and were more friendly and courteous towards those individuals. There were a few staff at breakfast that remembered my order the couple days I stayed at were pleasant. The concierge was surprising because when inquiring about the cost of a day trip to the Atlas Mountains they quoted a price 4X what was available from the best tour company online. I ended up going with the online tour company and the experience was wonderful in a Mercedes van with an English speaking tour guide. It’s baffling why the hotel would think they could get away with quoting prices at such a premium.    The spa at the property I felt was a bit overrated. The French hair stylist was really great and provided a high quality haircut. The royal hammam experience was not worth it. The hammam is a one hour experience of which 15 min is spent in the steam room and another 15 min is spent laying down while the body and face mask dry. Therefore 30 min is spent idle which does not seem like an efficient use of time for the cost. The one hour massage at the end was average.    Overall if I could chose again and when I send other people to Marrakech it will be to the Four Seasons even if the nightly rate is higher.,Date of stay: December 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kunster86

Honestly I’m a foodie and can sauce up bad food to taste good but have to admit the worst club sandwich and burger I’ve had.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Christine M wrote a review Dec 2019,50,"If you want to experience the local history and be treated like royalty, stay here",After all my family travels my sister and I decided to plan a bespoke heritage trip to Portugal and Morocco. With one year in the planning our tour service went dark and we were left recreating the trip. This is one of the places that was non-negotiable for us - we moved our dates to make our stay possible. It is true it is a real palace so don't expect clean white modern amenities. It has a storied past that continues today (think Madonna) and our guide told us all about it. We wanted to experience the culture and you cannot help but be immersed in local culture staying here. As 2 females traveling alone I want you to know that it is very important to choose a hotel that is safe and secure and offers top notch guide services. This hotel had that and so much more. The grounds are beautiful the restaurants outstanding and the breakfast by the pool every morning was simply amazing. This is a special place embrace the history and culture and stay here.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Mrs K wrote a review Dec 2019,40,Nice & beautiful life in a so-so hotel,All is gorgeus and service is great. Except a few details. The restaurants are terrible! And overly expensive. Food and the service leave much to wish for unfortunately we tried them all and they are all below acceptable. Everybody is kind and want to serve except in the lobby or by the pool where one needs to work hard to get some personal attention. Maybe because I’m a woman!? Not ok.  Another thing is the amazing and abundant looking breakfast that is harassed by plenty of little birds. Very unsanitary! Such a waste! Didn’t dare eat what I wanted. Only items under lid or below a glas shelf.  Rooms are very nice looking but are overly furnished so they can feel very tight. Bathrooms are gorgeous but dangerously slippery! So watch out! Ask for non slip mats and put them all over. Balcony over the pretty gardens are a must. So relaxing!  My advice eat elsewhere if you stay here.

La Mamounia Marrakech,savvas189449 wrote a review Dec 2019,20,Great building with one of worst management and handling of customers issues.,After staying in this hotel you have to note some things.Firstly be aware of eating breakfast in cold mornings.No inside space.Also be aware that the buffet on the open door is reached by birds which are eating the cereals that you eat too..So be careful your children.The spa treatment is by far the worst experience my wife had so made us cancel next day booking.Very simple with therapist with no level of experience.Another thing was a tart in pierre herme caffe that was mold on the top ordered for a 4 years old child.The waiter show itremoved the tart apologise and remove from bill and send a lemon tart.But the thing is that we were ready to eat it..So be carefull.Also for suite level you have only 6 capsules of nespresso per stay free and if you wish to have more one capsule costs 7€.Yes correct self service capsule coffee 7€.No amenities provided in room in bathroom for adts and children.So after filling the stay questionnaire i received an email of a lady Caroline Khosrovian guest relation manager she says soand after talking with her GM they decided that all those things are not a big problemthey are all excused for them and their staff so we are wrong and not them.Mrs Caroline probably you are young and unexperienced but by excusing yourselfs you dont provide correct management cause in the end you are paying from customers and customers need to pay satisfied especially if paying a lot of money or travelling with kids there and having issues that may have healthy concerns.So before answering like that better you should take some seminars of handling customers problem in a different mode.I studied marketing management and i know how things work.The last thing was that they are really concerned about their customers and they offer me a better price for next time so i can have a better future stay.So do you think somebody will repay 3000-4000€ just to risk to have one of the same and he will really care about your small discount?With these money per night tourists could stay in mandarin oriental or royal mansour which are closeby and much better quality than yours.Very sad that such a great building managed by people like you and your management.My opinion to future guests is going to this hotel by your own risknot worth for sure of money paying and not expect a personal customer service even after check out or check in.The mentality os totally wrong for 2019 that for sure,Date of stay: November 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Rhodes, Greece",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/savvas189449

La Mamounia Marrakech,hungrytotravelandeat wrote a review Nov 2019,50,Magical Hotel,La Mamounia is one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in. The hotel is stunning in every way. The gardens spa rooms and lounging areas are all magical making you feel as though you are in a luxuriously exotic location. The staff bend over backwards to make sure your stay is unforgettable. The location is excellent being a short walk to the souks and many historical sights and the food is delicious- we ate at the pool each morning for the breakfast buffet and then one night we ate at the Italian restaurant. My only negative comment is that there is not enough lighting in the rooms- especially the bathroom.

La Mamounia Marrakech,John S wrote a review Nov 2019,30,Beautiful Hotel But Room Not So Much,Some places live up to the hype. Some don’t. The reception areas and grounds of La Mamounia are spectacular. The gardens are beautiful. The pool area is great. Our room is a big disappointment. We saw pictures of rooms with terraces large enough to enjoy a nice cup of coffee. When we got here that was not our room. The toilet is enclosed in a very small area. If I close the door to the toilet I literally can’t sit on the toilet (it’s not due to my size). I slipped in the shower in Ouarzazate and am wary of slippery showers. The shower is slippery and has a urine like smell. They only gave us one key to the room. You have to put the key in a slot to activate the electricity (really?). My girlfriend just left with key. As a result there is no electricity in the room. The room is designed with a hallway and the bathroom/toilet is located in the hallway. With the electricity out the hallway is pitch black and I literally can’t find my way to the toilet. The room has old time radiators that take up space. There is very little room for luggage. The closet is very hard to use because it is crammed into a corner. We had dinner in the French restaurant. It had prices that put New York to shame. The food was good but the food did not justify the price. The breakfast buffet is outstanding but is $41 if not included with the room (ours was). Our guide said she dreamed of being able to stay at La Mamounia and changed her mind when we showed her the room. My advice-visit here. See the gardens and the hotel maybe have a drink (many people smoke here in common areas-probably not unique to La Mamounia). Stay somewhere else.,Date of stay: October 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lihtcguy
La Mamounia Marrakech,Antonia R wrote a review Oct 2019,20,Bad Management,In general the hotel is very beautiful. The rooms are pretty small and dark but the garden and the pool is very nice. The food and drinks are extremely overpriced (for example 10 euros for an iced tea or 30 euros for a ham and cheese sandwich). I also noticed one day that all of my make-up brushes were wet but didn't really think about it that much. The next day my white make-up brush was entirely pink and that there was a cotton pad laying on the bathroom floor full of red lipstick even though I hadn't used any. I went to the reception to complain and told them that I think that somebody from the housekeeping used my make-up. They called someone from the housekeeping who told me that this cannot be true as the only one who entered my room was a man which is completely ridiculous as I saw women cleaning my room multiple times. They told me they would get in touch with a manager and let me know what they can do but I never heard anything back. In the first place nothing like this should happen in a luxury hotel like this but if it does I expect something more than bad excuses that make no sense.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/antoniar853

La Mamounia Marrakech,Tami D wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Excellence in every detail,We stayed at La Mamounia during our summer trip with our 7yo boys and had an amazing time. We stayed at one of the Rhyads that line the beautiful gardens of the hotel and recommend it for anyone wishing to experience the very best Marrakech has to offer. The villa was enormous and well kept with a fun pool in the inner courtyard that we all enjoyed after a day of exploring. The villa and the hotel itself are full of beautiful details but what really sets La Mamounia apart is the outstanding service they provide. The restaurant room service spa and concierge were in every aspect perfect! I even had a hair cut at the spa and it was the best haircut I have EVER had- wish I could come back for trims every 4 months lol. We tried the food at both the Italian and Moroccan restaurants and both were delicious. Breakfast is varied with unexpected local items. We got a hotel guide to help us shop in the medina who was very very helpful and knowledgeable we bought some of our favorite art in places he recommended. Concierge was on top of their game and there was nothing they could not do. We did the Agafay dinner and had a good time but I think the experience is best for couples or families with older kids. Overall La Mamounia surpassed our high expectations over and over again and became one of our favorite hotels in the world. We hope to come back soon.,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/624tamic

La Mamounia Marrakech,Karla626 wrote a review Oct 2019,10,I couldn't have been more disappointed. Do not stay here if you have a mobility issue. NOT ACCESSIBLE,LaMamounia tells us that they were the #1 hotel in the world in 2018 so I was really excited to stay there for one night before my villa was ready. The VIP arrival at the airport despite my 8 bags and a wheelchair very courteous and helpful. That all ended when we got the hotel. I was traveling with my son who uses a walker and at times a wheelchair and this hotel is not accessible. He had to struggle up the stairs with the help of the door attendants. I booked and confirmed a room with two beds we arrive at our room and its one king bed in a tiny room. The doorway was so narrow the walker BARELY made it through. Before we arrived to our room we had to walk what seems like for ever! You would think that they would have placed us closer to the elevator so he wouldn't have to struggle to get to the room. Later that evening we have dinner at one of the restaurants on property - again NOT ACCESSIBLE there were at least 4 sets of stairs 4-8 steps each that we had to navigate. By the time we got to the restaurant my son was drenched from having to navigate the #1 hotel in the world that is not inclusive! I had a guest come to visit me and they gave him a hard time because he had on birkenstocks! The worst part was when we were leaving and the hotel would not let the private driver on property to take us to the villa we were staying for the next week. I had to make a fuss before he was allowed through the gates. I couldn't believe it.The level of pretentiousness at this place was on another level. There are many better hotels in Marrakech Royal Mansour or Selman to name two. I should have stayed there and had a much better experience.,Date of stay: June 2019,,"Maplewood, New Jersey",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karla626

It was heaven.  The hotel smells amazing.. be sure to stock up on la mamounia room spray and candles. They are hard to get back home in US.  Suites are gorgeous comfortable and roomy.  I concentrated on the French and Moroccan pastries at the poolside daily breakfast buffet but they have full breakfast fare. There are several restaurants and all are good.

La Mamounia Marrakech,M.G. wrote a review Oct 2019,40,Very good hotel but with one serious problem,Before I start I only want to mention that I’m used to booking upper 5 star hotels or even 6 star hotels with my family (Mandarin Orientel Fairmont or Royal Palm in Mauritius for example) and I’m not very picky as long as everything is in general fine.  So to get started: I visited the last two two years La Mamounia and decided to not travel to La Mamounia this year.  The hotel itself is great. The rooms the garden and the pool area is very beautiful and everything has a high standard and quality.  But the hotel has one serious problem which I experienced every year. If you want to relax at the pool during the day you start to realize that there is hierarchy between the hotel guest and which sunbed a hotel guest is allowed to occupy. I don’t know if the hotel instructs the pool boys to behave like this or if the pool boys implemented there own system...The pool area can be split into three areas. The area close to the hotel is the best because you have all day sunshine The problem is that if you are a guest which only stays for less then a week there is no chance to get a sunbed. The poolboys would always reserve the sunbeds for the regular costumers with a magazine. So the result is that the best area with the whole day sunshine is actually prohibited for a normal costumers. I even tried it by paying a tip of 50 euros to the pool boys but it did not help.  The problem of the other two ares along the pool and facing the garden is in October that from 4 p.m. you only have shadow due to the large palm trees. After testing some time I found the perfect sunbed spot facing the garden. However the next day suddenly 5 sunbeds were placed there and each sunbed was reserved with a magazine by the pool boy for a guest who wanted this spot. I was so pissed and upset that eventually two additionally sunbeds were placed there which turned out to be a bit crowded but I didn’t care.  I think it is ridiculous that you have to fight for your sunbeds in a 6 star hotel and it is impossible to get one of the „good“ sunbeds as a hotel guest who stays for less then a week. It should be first come first serve. But I think it is to attractive for the pool boys with regards to the tip to actually handle it like this. During my first stay I talked with the general manager but i didn’t experience any change during my second stay one year later.  Overall it is a great hotel but if you want to relax a few days at the pool other hotels are definitely a better choice.  Despite the pool situation there has been one more little thing which isn’t a big issue but always made me thinking - it seems to be 6 stars but somehow there is something missing - the breakfast. First of all the hotel buffet does not offer Mangos which always made thinking: maybe it is not easy to get Mangos in Marrakesch but still they should offer it. The seconds thing is that I like to make myself a sandwich with Parma ham or something similar. On the first day they offered it and the days after I was told that it is not common and therefore not offered. This was again something were I though: This is basic stuff in a basic 5 star hotel around the world.  So overall a beautiful hotel but especially with the pool stress a reason to choose a different hotel.,Date of stay: November 2018,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F-M-G-0
La Mamounia Marrakech,Sally M wrote a review Sep 2019,10,For the money not worth it,I was traveling with 7 women in September and stayed here for 3 nights. This is considered the number 1 hotel in the world. You could have fooled us. We experienced very poor service from the moment we arrived. It was the first day for the woman that checked us in. Some people in our party did not get into their rooms until 6:00 PM. The suitcases were delivered to the wrong rooms. Wi-fi and their telephones were not working. At one point one of us had to leave their room with wet hair to get a blow dryer because the phone still did not work. Some of our rooms were in the basement which felt like a dungeon. We left a room service card out the night before which was never picked up and finally got an ironing board after several requests. We were able to talk to the night manager the 2nd night. We were told the main manager would contact us the next day. NOTHING!!! They were having a big wedding plus a big party for a wealthy hedge fund manager. The Clintons were expected to attend. Where did the hotel’s priorities stand? Obviously not with us!  We had a wonderful time in Morocco but I highly recommend against staying here.

We enjoyed our culinary highlights with specially designed menus by the Executive Chef Mr Rachid Agouray who's experience in Marocco cuisine is unique. We enjoyed his personal touch and his creative fusions he gathered on his tours around the globe offering delightful dishes with the best in traditional and modern cuisine.  In addition we also had the chance to be pampered by the Chef Sommelier Mr Mikael Rodriguez who opened us a new world of surprising wines which are on the top level of European single wines and blends.  All in all these few days were like being in paradise we felt like at home and will never forget it hopefully having the chance to be back soon.,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled on business,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PilarLatorre
La Mamounia Marrakech,MFL wrote a review Sep 2019,50,We found all what was promised 👌,We spent one night and could confirm that everything announced was true. The hotel is beautiful the pool area is relaxing the spa is very very good and the room is nice (although we stayed in the smallest so the view was not good at all).  All the personnel for every area of service is focused on making you feel you are having the best experience.  My only advise to future guests is to be prepared for pricy food. Even though food was not bad at all in fact was pretty good it was definitely overpriced in comparison to similar quality in other places of similar characteristics. This is applicable for breakfast (40 euros each) poolside food and drinks and especially for restaurants. We had dinner in the Italian restaurant and Wine bottles was the extreme of overpriced items of course if you are staying in this hotel you are going to pay for it but having this feeling that you cannot believe those prices are for real. 😊  In many hotels of similar level it is possible find a better balance of price/quality.  Anyway our evaluation is good because the experience was definitely good.,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mflueiza
La Mamounia Marrakech,SHGLASGOW wrote a review Sep 2019,50,Cocktails at this beautiful hotel,My sister and I were staying in Marrakesh for 3 nights and our guide pointed out this beautiful hotel when we were touring the city on a horse and carriage. We booked a taxi and rolled up on the Saturday evening and were made to feel very special as soon as we arrived. We settled in the cocktail bar which has a really laid back relaxing feel to it. Cocktails and nibbles were a delight and service was great as expected. It was strange to see people smoking in the bar but you couldn't smell the smoke thankfully. We wandered through the beautiful gardens too amazing would have been lovely to stay the night. The doorman was so nice and friendly.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Percy wrote a review Sep 2019,50,Luxury from beginning to end!,Had the most amazing at La Mamounia! The service staff and overall experience was perfect from beginning to end. I had a wonderful one bedroom suite with views of the garden. Room was impeccable. If I had to complain about anything I wish the shower was larger - but overall that didn’t really make a difference. Pools breakfast bars all A+ experience. Every staff member I encountered was seriously so accommodating and nice. Hotel is conveniently located to everything the city has to offer. We walked to the souks and Medina though a cab is also very affordable. Casino next to the hotel was pretty cool too. Having a Dior and YSL and other luxury shops in the hotel was dangerous for me...luckily they specialized more on women’s goods. Spa was good.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Pyper R wrote a review Sep 2019,30,Stunning accommodations but poor service,"To start you cannot imagine a more beautiful hotel / palace than Mamounia - not to mention the endless picture-perfect views. However given the high price point of this hotel we expected good service which we were very disappointed with (we received MUCH better service at our $100+/night Riad a few days prior...)    The rooms - it's a palace need I say more? You will feel like royalty staying here. However make sure the front desk staff show you how to operate the room when you check-in! They didn't show us a thing and the cleaning crew drew the metal barrier over the windows before we slept and it was hard to figure out how to get them up took 6 of us in 3 rooms a solid 15 minutes and it makes getting up very hard because it's pitch black!    The grounds - again it's a palace and . Make sure to visit the black/white room with the columns it was so pretty and made for some great photos!    Now for the downside.... the service was AWFUL! There are so many people just visiting the property that the staff have no idea who are guests and when you try to enter a guest-only location they very rudely let you know that it is ""Private"" rather than ask you if you are a guest in a more polite manner. We had this happen several times by the same staff! They should know who guests are or at least use common manners to ask your room or if you are staying at the hotel...    Overall Mamounia is absolutely stunning but don't waste your money for an overnight stay there - the staff made it less enjoyable and not worth the high price tag.. just go for a visit and get your pictures while staying at a Riad with much better service",Date of stay: August 2019,,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pyperribble

Weather was a beautiful 33deg in June and sunny. The hotel has the most amazing gardens that you are free to wander around day and night and the ever present smell of dates in the air from their own signature scent infusers (at first it was a bit over-powering but I did get used to it and even purchased a room spray of the same scent!). The staff were all very welcoming and friendly. There is a dress-code for the hotel so please be aware of this if you want to visit for the day.

Sad that 40Dollar breakfast can only be eaten by the pool on cheap furniture. No warm welcome by the staff for breakfast. Plus:had to discuss just to choose a preferred table. Cheap plastic water bottles all around. Overall breakfast not worth the money quantity without quality. Really save this money and go outside.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Kirk94025 wrote a review Jul 2019,50,"Stupendous luxury, comfort, class and service. Awesome!!","Bottom line: stupendous luxury comfort class and service. Awesome!!    Here is more detail.    Our travel group consisted of a total of two families each with two parents and two kids. The kids were aged 13 and 11. We were on a two week trip through Morocco. We are seasoned travelers and have stayed in a wide range of accommodations.    I had read about this hotel for years and was so excited to finally stay here. It exceeded my expectations!    The hotel is located on grounds previously owned by royalty and gradually developed into a hotel in the early 20th century. Over the years it has been synonymous with the best of Marrakesh and it has hosted many statesmen celebrities etc..    The hotel is configured alongside large and lovely gardens that are amazingly beautiful and appropriately evoke historical Moroccan design. They are a pleasure to see and walk in.    The hotel's design is a good mix of traditional and modern. Most of the main architectural decisions are from the early 20th century while the design elements and fitting feature traditional Moroccan tile ornate woodwork plaster carving softened by more modern fabrics and finishes. It is really lovely and luxurious although not at all ostentatious.    The rooms are great. Quite luxurious bedding and terrific amenities. Marrakesh can get hot and the A/C was terrific. The hotel has a lovely pool and patio area that is extremely relaxing and with excellent views of the gardens.    The service was absolutely impeccable. The reservation desk generously gave us a late check out to help us enjoy the last day before our evening flight departure.    I have to say that the concierge desk here was probably the best I’ve ever encountered anywhere in the world. In addition to their terrific recommendations for site-seeing meal reservations and other “normal” things they went above and beyond. They assisted me with business printing and scanning. I asked them to research where to purchase various incredibly tile that was a central part of the hotel’s design. I asked them to find where I might purchase some paintings similar to ones found in the hotel. I asked them for recommendations for the best traditional and contemporary Moroccan music. They came through on everything with ease! When exploring the paintings to purchase they advised me that they could assist with the various government approvals that may be necessary along with shipping and insurance. They said “Sir please contact us if you need any help with your future activities in Morocco whether for art of otherwise. Once you have been a guest with us you are always a guest with us. We are at your disposal."" I hope the management will recognize them for their terrific service.    The hotel is located about a 7-10 minute walk from the edge of the ""old town"" called the medina. On the way you see the famous Koutoubia minaret/mosque and pass through a lovely public park. It is well located and there are many activities.    Many other writers and forum participants have commented on the bothersome sales/engagement of the male “touts” of Marrakech. We were definitely approached but it never became at all annoying or negative. Once we hired a guide everyone pretty much stayed away.    This is the kind of hotel that dreams are made of.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Boris Samaryanov wrote a review Jul 2019,10,Unexpectedly bad experience,This was our last stop after a few Moroccan cities and it actually ruined all impressions of this country. Being a travel agent myself and having previously stayed at more than 30 hotels-members of the Leading Hotels of the World I can assure that this hotel in no way corresponds the the LHW standards in terms of the customer service or cleanliness.  1. My luggage was searched on the way to the room upon check-in. I was told I was allowed to carry inside only 2 bottles of wine and I had 3 so 1 bottle was held by the consierge...where and what are these rules??? I felt like I’m the smuggler violating the state border. I had a huge fight with the personnel to get it back  2. The check-in took more than 15 minutes. Then the room wasn’t ready at 4pm and we were offered a hotel tour instead of the room first. Then there was a room with king size bed with two separate twin mattresses. The check-in manager tried to persuade us that it was THE KING SIZE bed. We insisted to be relocated. Finally we’ve ended up in a proper room 1 hour later since we arrived.  3. The iron that I requested into the room fell apart in my hands and I had an electricity current shock. It took the staff more than 45 minutes to replace it.  4. The room wasn’t perfectly clean the internal surfaces of the iron radiator in the corner and the window separating the bathroom from the living-room were covered with dust and I asked to clean them. Nothing happened until I checked out.  5. Poor breakfast selection for the hotel of this level. Arrogant staff at the breakfast restaurant. 4 kinds of fruits only with apples and oranges amongst them. Forget about a morning glass of champagne like in other similar hotels if you expected that. One morning it took almost 15 minutes for the tea to arrive the waiter placed an opened and almost finished water bottle on my table. When I asked what was that he replied that it was a mineral water. And left without pouring it into the glasses.  6. Another surprise was the taxies outside. The doormen help you get a taxi by calling the cars standing 30 meters away and fixing the price for the ride which is three times more than if you walk there yourself. The ride to a 500 meter-away restaurant was announced at the price of 70 Riads when the return ride was only 20. And we had a big argument about that. You probably won’t care about this in a hotel where Aperol Spritz cocktail is 35 USD but it just shows the personnel is not on the side of the guests to help.  7. I tried to talk to the hotel General Manager several times. He was never available doing other very important things rather than trying to talk to upset guests. I had to explain my problems to each new duty or guest relations managers from the start as the previous ones neither recorded anything nor reacted anyhow to my complaints.  8. The funniest thing was the questions upon check-out ‘how was your stay with us’ asked by at least 4 or 5 people. No matter what I said (‘so so’ ‘had some problems’ ‘did not like it’) the stuff replied ‘oh thank you very much’....  Would you want to come back there again?...,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Moscow, Russia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/boriss662

The SPA and Hamman are definitely worth experiencing. Although it was a bit confusing as to what to do when shown to the relaxing area. I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had known what was going to take place as far as the ""royal treatment"" was. The scrub was rough I will not kid you. But my skin did feel vibrant afterwards. We did have one slight problem with a tour that the hotel set up but because my husband was persistent we did get it worked out. The rates on the hotel website apparently had not been updated so they tried to charge more than what the site quotes. All in all it was a very pleasant stay. Wish we had gone to the craftsman's shop who makes the exquisite lamps and sconces for the hotel! It was beautifully decorated Thanks for La Mamounia staff Desert Day Tours and Mohammed that arranged for us to stay here during our tour of 7 days with them",Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Los Angeles, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/enjoylifeee

La Mamounia Marrakech,Jean Felipe L wrote a review Jun 2019,20,"Not bad, buy way overrated!",The hotel itself is fine and location is excellent. However everything else fell short. The staff is not very fluent in English which is bizarre for the self proclaimed best hotel in the World. On top of that the hotel has some intriguing dress code which seems surreal for a city in the edge of a desert. However my biggest grip was how indifferent and borderline rude the Managers are regarding all the shortcomings and deficiencies. All of them keep saying “I respect your point of view but I don’t agree” like parrots.

My wife (she is an PharmD and happened to be traveling with another friend who is an MD) and I got food poisoning from eating eggs at breakfast. It was the only place our group had eaten since we arrived so we were certain it was from breakfast (the other couple ate everything we had except the eggs and didn’t get sick). I became violently ill and the hotel sent a Dr to our room which was amazing. He let us know he was attending to several other guests with similar symptoms staying in the hotel.    At checkout the next day we asked to see the manager and they brought out the director of guest services. He was an arrogant man (For some reason I can’t get the picture of this guys fat stomach hanging over his Hermès belt out of my head) who denied that anyone else had gotten sick and said it couldn’t be from his property. He then proceeded to argue with the Dr’s about the amount time it takes to get symptoms food poisoning. This made the situation even worse.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Smelval wrote a review Jun 2019,20,Beautiful property but unfortunately not good customer service,We stayed in this beautiful property from June 1st to June 6th however I was very disappointing with the service received from several employees at this property. We had about 6 incidents where the staff was very rude and at times felt discriminated against. The first incident was with the head waiter at Le Marocain Restaurant. I went to reserve a table for my group of 15 for dinner the following night. After meeting with the restaurant manager I proceeded to take pictures of the restaurants (which was closed at the time and no one was there except for the wait staff) and the head waiter told me in a very rude way that I could not take pictures. I called the manager and told me what had happened - he apologized and let me take the pictures. The following night when we had dinner 2 of the waiter (including the same person that told me not to take pictures) were rude and definitely did not made us feel welcomed. Again I addressed this with the manager and he again apologized and said he would address this with management (he was very courteous and gave us great service). Another incident came at breakfast where certain staff would not allow for us to sit together because we were a large group (Mind you there were a lot of open tables at the time that we were there). On the second or third day we came in from our excursion we started taking pictures of the outside of the property and the people at the door told us that we cannot take pictures. I asked him why I could not take pictures and he told me that only registered guests could take pictures. Not only was he rude in the way he told us we could not take pictures but also ASSUMED we were not guest at the property which made me feel discriminated against (and this situation happened twice). At this point I went to the front desk to talk to the hotel manager but the manager was not available. I left my room number but no one ever contacted me during the 5 nights we were there. Another incident happened at the bar- we were the ONLY table at the bar again I proceeded to take pictures of the bar area and the bar tender (the only one making drink there) again told me I could not take pictures. The manager came asked the bar tender to move and I took my pictures. My point is- I was there a year ago (May 2018) with my family. It was because of THESE PICTURES that I took of this property that I was able to convince 15 of my close friends to stay at this property this time around (June 2019). If this hotel does not allow pictures in the property then they should disclose this on their website or if they have employees that have issues with people taking pictures then they should politely remove themselves from the situation. Also if they have concerns about people coming in that are not registered guests- they need to train their staff to ask the right questions first instead of assuming someone in not a registered guest. This is very offensive especially for someone that is a registered guest. I have traveled to more than 55 countries and stayed at the best hotels in the world and to be honest I was very disappointed at the level of service provided at this hotel by some of the employees. They might have a beautiful property but without good service the property just becomes another overrated hotel in the area.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Laredo, Texas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Smelval

You’re treated like royalty when you enter and once you’re ensconced in your room you’ll never want to leave. The hallways are like mirrors. The Churchill Bar is overrated like the man himself. I guess it serves to draw in UK tourists. I overheard two English women chatting away in the alcoves. It’s very hard to adulate a man these days who thought nothing of gassing the Kurds and left behind wonderful quotes like these: “I am strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against uncivilised tribes” and was partly responsible for the Bengal famine which killed millions. The whisky portions were good though. Food is expensive at the various restaurants - I ordered a €650 bottle of wine by mistake. Breakfast is phenomenal. The servers were very attentive. The only ‘rude and arrogant’ staff member I met was the pool manager who gave my chair away when I was briefly in my room and only managed to say ‘Bonjour’ when confronted.

La Mamounia Marrakech,hotelsmoment wrote a review May 2019,30,I expected a little bit more - The Afternoon Tea,We were sitting on the terrace in front of the gardens but there were also many people passing through the terrace to visit the garden. Even though I love the concept of allowing everyone visiting the Garden it spoils the experience a little bit.  The dress code has changed apparently.    The High Tea is serviced with the traditional Pastilla (a crispy chicken pie with icing sugar and cinnamon; Moroccan pastries with almonds and honey served with mint tea; and the Famous Pierre Hermé Macaroons. Everything was delicious no question about it.  BUT:  If you’d like a glass of water you have to ask? The first thing people need especially when it’s hot is to serve a glass of water to the guest (it doesn’t actually matter if you put an extra on the bill) but water is essential. Even the coffee shop on the nook of the street give you a glass of water with your coffee or whatever.    Most of the time of my “High Tea” experiences in hotels they offer you the unconsumed of the pastry in a nice paper bag with the name of the Hotel or the Pastry Chef; In this experience I received an aluminium box (Just like the Chinese takeaway) and I had to ask for a bag.

The details in the architecture from the entry to the lobby are incredible. As you are checked in by the front desk and served your almond milk tea you feel as if you are the only one in the hotel — very special. The gardens are lush and expansive. Then you are guided to your palace of a room with its intricate Moroccan architecture you feel like this is the epitome of luxurious hospitality.    Then you close the door alone in your room ready to relax. Darn...you booked the Hivernage room meaning you hear the street cars horse carriages honking horns of the Hivernage street! To top that off your view is of the staff entry gate so every time you are looking out most likely someone is coming through the gate. Ok so you don’t go out on the balcony and you close the shutters to try keep out some noise. Anyway you can use your ear plugs to sleep. But how about in room coffee? No luck unless you ask for the Capsule machine to be brought up with an upcharge of 7 euros per capsule used. You decide that you can wait u til the breakfast. There’s coffee at the breakfast located poolside along with the hoards of other guests swarming the buffet. This pattern continues throughout the hotel in all public spaces such as the bars and outdoor seating. I didn’t realize that I booked a cruise ship with people all over the place. There is no sense of privacy as the the hotel is full. You just make the best of it but it sucks as you are paying for your room arm and leg.    I won’t even comment on how the concierge tried to book a 2000 euro camel ride for 3 until I said “NO WAY!”    Next time....Royal Mansour.

Not relaxing or enjoyable. We asked to move and were initially moved one table along still insight and sounds of kitchen doors and then after asking again Re moved to another area of the restaurant. The food was good but in all honestly i would neither go back to the restaurant nor stay at the hotel which we had prior considered. Service was mediocre it felt like the staff ‘expected’ clients to be appreciative rather than aiming to help clients enjoy their experience. I don’t think they really cared about our poor experience at all even when we politely explained out thoughts.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CVT100

It took us almost one hour to do the check in (not because it was busy) and people at front desk looked like they were new or were still training. Food is excellent. The buffet at the pool area restaurant and the Italian restaurant are outstanding and service is good. Rooms are very good and clean and service is great.

La Mamounia Marrakech,mark wrote a review Apr 2019,30,Afternoon tea,We went to the hotel for afternoon tea to celebrate a special occasion. We were nicely dressed better than many of the tests in fact. After a wander around the gardens which are really beautiful we went to the terrace for tea. After 15 minutes of being totally ignored by the staff as though we were invisible we had to ask for the menu - embarrassing! The service was slow and once the tea and cake arrived we were ignored again having to ask repeatedly for ore milk hot water etc. In summary a beautiful and historic hotel let down by very indifferent service which I can see reflected on other reviews.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Pittasporum wrote a review Apr 2019,50,The Summit of Cool,I didn’t stay there painfully expensive and this was Easter but I spent much of my long weekend in Marrakech at this elegant and sumptuous hotel. We would go there for drinks before heading off to another less expensive restaurant for dinner - a practice I totally recommend.  We did (eight of us) have Easter Sunday lunch there and it was glorious. We managed to get a great table by the pool and the staff and food and of course the setting was all it should be to give this great hotel the reputation it has and deserves.  I found the smoking in Morocco (allowed in restaurants) very irritating and so lunching outdoors had an added advantage. You’ll need to book early but on any trip to Marrakech a pre-dinner drink or poolside lunch at La Mamounia is a must.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pittasporum

La Mamounia Marrakech,Analog wrote a review Apr 2019,50,My trip to la mamounia,I recently stayed at la mamounia and will definitely be returning soon. The hotel has classic authentic Moroccan architecture and is a perfect contrast to the chaotic streets of Marrakesh. Located in the prince of Morocco’s palace with top quality staff picked from the best. They are very good at communicating with each other and as soon as you order something with just a signal they can send your order to the kitchen. The Moroccan restaurant has private dining rooms with three storeys and plenty of space. Note that as residents we were allowed to wear shorts but you’re not permitted inside the hotel as a guest unless covered up. Not only is there a Moroccan restaurant but also an Italian restaurant a fine dining French restaurant and a poolside bar. I found it amazing how all the staff were familiar with my name and family which made the trip a lot easier as I didn’t have to explain anything. The hotel has a range of luxurious shops including Dior and Saint Laurent... There are two pools a lovely hammam but overall the highlight of the trip for me was the fresh almond milk at breakfast and the service. 100% go to la mamounia because it is fabulous.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/analoggg

Encouraged by my friends that there were in Marrakech before and stayed at Lamamounia (a place I heard a lot of and saw so many editorials) I decided to book from concierge desk of my hotel a full day at Lamamounia (lunch pool & SPA)...they confirmed me that booking was executed in date 13/4/19 for the following date 14/4/19... was so excited and looking forward to it anticipating luxury events in my mind. Upon my arrival the poor service started (no friendly people clearly busy) they sent me from reception desk to concierge desk and back returned to reception desk to send me to regulate bill and registration at cash desk.  There a man from Morocco slim & small glasses verified booking and told him that it was only a lunch booking as SPA was full booked (and u can’t access pool without a SPA as part of the forfait) I asked him to verify with my hotel concierge and then his tone over the phone started raising up (how embarrassing for me in front of other hotel guests)... then the guy start blaming my concierge desk not having recorded the name of the guy at Mamamounia that took her booking for me and that she was unprofessional... he then turned in Arabic and hung the phone down violently on her... I left in shock and grim with embarrassment and as I was going the guy did not even excused himself for what I was just experiencing nor for the inconvenience (after all I came as a client and not as a tourist entering to make a shoot or a selfie... disappointed and humiliated I returned to my hotel and I asked concierge to call Mamamounia hotel as I wanted to give a feedback to management but they wouldn’t allow to forward her call to management for her and hanging up on her (mafia desk at Mamamounia)...  I stayed in the most beautiful hotel in the world such as 4 Seasons & One & only and I have been members at Burj Al Arab to use SPA & Fitness facilities but never I was dealt so disrespectfully as of today ...so in few days I leave Morocco with a bitter flavor and for sure a feeling not wanting to step in Mamamounia ever again in my life...

Buffets were fabulous and a great mixture of eastern food and European.

All the facilities are present the grounds and the swimming pool are magnificent and the room was delightful.    The lobby is so dark and gloomy that it is difficult to see. Check-in time is 3 pm and we arrived at 3.30. Our rooms were not ready but they did not tell us how long it would be before they would be ready. We were left to sit in the dark lobby and were left entirely alone for nearly 30 minutes before we complained. Another period passed before the rooms were available and at no time were we invited to have an refreshments while we were waiting. Obviously the reception personnel are inadequately trained. They did put a bottle of champagne into our room to apologise but.....    There is an excellent breakfast buffet and breakfast is eaten out of doors adjacent to the swimming pool. We were there in early March and it was really very cold in the early mornings. While they do provide heaters it was necessary to dress warmly for breakfast.

La Mamounia Marrakech,CoreyLA86 wrote a review Mar 2019,10,SPA IS TERRIBLE SERVICE,This review is for the Spa. The original inquiry email to the spa was asking about the cost of the private spa and our interest in getting 2 hot stone massages for myself and a friend. We recieved an email letting us know the private spa is an extra 500 diram ($50 usd). I emailed back letting them know we'd pass on the private spa but still recieve the massage. To our surprise after paying we were still charged for the private spa which on the site includes: 1 haman 1 jacuzzi 1 hair dressing salon dressing room and shower as stated on the site. The day of we were walked into the main dressing room and shower area by a man. This is especially uncomfortable for people in the dressing room who may or may not be clothed when HE is bring guests in. We thought we had a private dressing room and shower but did not make a fuss.We had some tea before the massage and then were walked into a shared treatment room. We had no idea we were going to be sharing a room as we booked separate massages. The hot stone massage was just okay. Mediocre at best. After the massage we inquired about the private spa we were charged for. We then were told the private spa was only for hotel guests at that hour. We were charged for this and offered NONE of the amenities the websites states. While the receptionist was trying to explain all this in THE MOST CONFUSING WORD PLAY she stated that they made an exception for us and put us in a shared room. She said this with a grim smug look on her face like they were bending the rules for us and we never asked to share a room. As we were trying to understand her confusing explanation another customer interrupted and the receptionist helped her and stopped trying to help us understand how were were charged but not provided services. We just wanted to get out of there at that point so we headed to the showers. One of the three showers did not lock and only two supplied shampoo. My friend had to wash her hair with body soap. Again considering the price you would think this would have all been up to a standard. As I was blow drying my hair the guy walking in guests came in several times. Make sure you are clothed because there is a man walking around. I felt a women would have been more comfortable. After my blow dry I walked over to my belongings to find my robe with my phone in the pocket had been collected for laundry. This would be understandable if it was left and there was no one around. However I had my robe on top of my backpack and personal belongings. We left clearly disappointed and very confused. No one from the staff even said goodbye or asked if we enjoyed our time. This is all a heads up because you will spend several hundred dollars here but the accommodations are not up to par.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Los Angeles, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CoreyLA86
La Mamounia Marrakech,Chia1234 wrote a review Mar 2019,40,Jewel of marrakech,La Mamounia was awarded #1 hotel 2018 in the Travel & Leisure magazine. This piqued our interest and a trip was crafted to enjoy this experience.    As we meandered our way from Tangier  Chefchaouen  Fez and finally Marrakech- we couldn’t be more excited to have THE experience at La Mamounia.    Upon arrival we were ushered into the beautiful lobby.... after which the bubble burst. One hour to check in and after which we were given the keys with no one to show us to the room and to explain the features. A definite NO for a hotel if this class.  What made it worse was we saw a Caucasian guest being escorted and given an explanation of the hotel features. Discrimination??  We were given rooms in the old wing but we had lucked out with view of the roof below. We had booked early too!!    A poor first impression surely...    However the service at the breakfast place housekeeping was efficient and good. However I noticed the smiles and service were commensurate with the tips given. Top marks for the good and elegant service at La Marocain  their Moroccan restaurant. The captain did an excellent job with deciphering the menu and the suggestions for tangia marrackchia  spiny lobster tagine and lobster pastilla was excellent.  Service was on par with 3 star Michelin restaurants internationally.    The grounds are immaculately groomed with emerald green lawns perfumed by bitter orange and grapefruit trees. A walk around yielded a herb garden that was in the process of harvesting a myriad of vegetables.    Inside the spa - calm and serene - an enticing aquamarine mosaic tiled pool beckoned.  The piano bar had a pianist that had a good repertoire of jazzy hits.    Rooms are good size with perfect crisp linens and the bath towels are the most luxurious ever. The toiletries are generous. A nice touch are the fruit boxes they supply daily - then again it is costed into the room rate.    #1- not too sure... especially as we also had staff asking if we were guests twice? Do we have 3 eyes?  But let them bask is the glory for now ....,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Singapore, Singapore",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chia1234
La Mamounia Marrakech,Carol D wrote a review Mar 2019,30,Some things are lacking,The location of this well-known hotel is wonderful. The property is clean and well-maintained. The staff is very very accommodating. The gardens are beautiful but because of that there is a constant parade of people who are not guests coming through the lobby in the lounge area to go out to the gardens. We ate at both the French and the Moroccan restaurants and the food was certainly not on a par with the price. Our advice would be to go elsewhere for your meals. Extremely high priced and uninteresting food. We used the spa to get a Hammam. We ordered the Royal Hawaiian and they neglected to give us that's service. It took 15 to 20 minutes of haggling afterward to get a satisfactory price reduction since they did not give us what we had ordered. The Royal Mansour is far more luxurious and much quieter as there is no Public Access unless you are a guest or dining at the hotel.,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S8038FGcarold

La Mamounia Marrakech,Bjf4112 wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Wow!,La Mamounia in Marrakech is rated one of the best hotels in the world. Without question we agree. Having travelled all over the world and been fortunate to stay at many of the best establishments we have a sense of what makes a place special. La Mamounia is gorgeous in every detail. While this is important what we value is service and the La Mamounia staff delivered. They are polite and “old world” elegant while still being warm and genuinely friendly. We stayed five nights and ate mostly at the hotel restaurants and drank at the very popular Italian bar. Over the course of our stay the staff got to know and recognize us. We felt like family which is a great feeling for us and a compliment to them.  All this being saidthere are a few areas that were less than perfect. Our suite was lovely but very warm ( we are convinced the A/C was held at about 72 Fahrenheit); there is a huge issue with lighting - someone said in a review that the lighting is confusing and we concur. The hotel needs to fix the lighting- although I got proficient at applying make-up and showering in what I will call “subdued” lighting.  A few other things: laundry and shoe-polishing service is available with specified times for delivery. We used both services and had to call housekeeping to bring us our shoes and laundry. We think the Moroccan culture is very polite to the point of being timid hence they don’t want to be pushy. We saw this with service at the bars and restaurants-;it took awhile to get waited on and frequently we had to flag someone down for a second drink.  Finally the restaurants: We ate at all 4 at the hotel. The Italian restaurant was certainly good; although not memorable. The Moroccan restaurant was a truly wonderful experience- good food and ambiance with truly spectacular service. We HIGHLY RECCOMEND Le Marocain. Previous reviews have commented that it is expensive; we think it was one of the best values of our stay. We strongly suggest asking the sommelier for wine pairings per course as this is both cost effective and makes for a better experience. Also the spiny lobster starter is amazing!  The French restaurant is certainly good but again not memorable. However the cassoulet with escargot is a treat - not really what we expected but very tasty as a warm salad with snails and chorizo over greens freshly harvested from the hotel’s garden.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Burson17 wrote a review Mar 2019,10,How is this hotel still in business?,A once great hotel totally mis-managed and out of touch with what modern luxury demands trading on its history but utterly woeful and waste of money.  Our room was dark and pokey the wardrobe was in the corridor the pool was pleasant and gardens are well manicured but the restaurants are absolutely awful the supposedly fantastic Italian has a small limited choice of the most basic Italian food at truly eye watering prices the French restaurant never had more than 4 people dine there any evening and again prices were crazy.....Nothing though prepared me for lunch which i only sampled once @£100 p/head for a motorway services standard poor buffet. Residents in this hotel dine elsewhere clearly all of the people in the bar on an evening are staying elsewhere and coming for drinks.  I am giving 1 star i would like to give zero.  On departure i was presented with a minibar bill for £100 we had nothing from the minibar i complained twice the first time the charge was halved and then removed. Everything about this hotel is geared towards charging as much as they can get away with. The are far better Marrakech hotels at a fraction of the cost.,Date of stay: October 2018,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Burson17

La Mamounia Marrakech,flywithlola wrote a review Mar 2019,50,No doubt why it is ranked among the Top 10 hotels of the world!,As it´s a luxury hotel we booked the standard rooms. They were spaciously enough but the decoration is stunning. I would love to have my own room decorated like that! We were welcome very well with mint tea and pastries.  The location is excellent as the main square is only 1 block away so it´s walking distance (but as the mosque is nearby you´ll be waken up at 6am with the religious call which is very loud). The are 2 pools outdoor and indoor pools and a spa. Breakfast is amazing and there are many restaurants inside to have dinner if you don´t want to go out. There is also a garden with orange tres where you can walk and relax.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Central Argentina, Argentina",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flywithlola
La Mamounia Marrakech,Alan G wrote a review Mar 2019,10,Ellen G,Our stay at La Mamounia was definitely a disappointment. The staff was rude from the moment we arrived. Our tv didn’t work the safe was broken and there were ants in our bed. We told the gentleman who greeted us that we would like to make a reservation at the Italian restaurant on the property. He assured us that he would take care of it. When the 6 of us arrived at the restaurant no reservation. We were ‘finally’ seated but then asked to switch tables before we could take a drink. When we complained to the same man who assured us that he would make the reservation he outright denied it.  Staff was rude and unapologetic.  Not worth the money.

Fabulous and spacious grounds with a lovely little tea pavilion in the middle. Good technogym and the most amazing outdoor swimming pool I have ever seen in a hotel which appeared to be underused by guests.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Culas wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Perfect. Absolutely no bad angles.,La Mamounia completely lived up to and even surpassed my expectations. I wish we could have stayed longer. I say “no bad angles” because it’s a beautiful hotel and wherever you look it’s stunning.  The arrival experience at check in was perfect especially after a long day of traveling. We stayed in an Agdal suite which had a great view of the gardens. I found the room a bit too dim but it was all part of the ambience I suppose.  Located right outside the Medina and just a short walk from some good night spots. Service was excellent. Concierge assisted me even prior to arrival and they recommended some lovely places to dine and visit.  Breakfast by the pool watching the sunrise behind the landscape made the dining experience even better every morning. The staff were all very courteous and accommodating.

I liked the location as it is close to the airport close to the souks Koutoubia Mosque etc. The garden on the premises are also fantastic and the reception area is beautiful. We found the waiters rather pleasant. The food though is really not good the breakfast is just ok the pool looks like some Riu pool the rooms are small (we booked Deluxe) and all in all we just did not get why it should be praised as much as it was.

The only positives are the large and spectacular garden with nice swimming pools and the doormen those guys were great... Rooms are a bit tired and not particularly comfortable (really a waste of money) even though we stayed in one of their suites. The restaurant staff was the worst I have ever experienced in Morocco.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Francois wrote a review Feb 2019,10,Not a good experience at all,Bad experience (5 nights in family with one kid). to summarize go just for visiting (drink or dinner) but never book a room for the following reasons:    - really medium and slow service (40 minutes for 2 bottles of waters after 1 reminder call)  - not family driven. My kid wanted a pizza (no pizza at all with room service!) so we bought one outside and come back to eat it in the hotel : we have been refused at entrance gate! Then I met with the manager in charge (not the general manager as she explained to me that he was not on site) who never tried to find a solution and my kid ate his pizza in the street. Unbelievable but true! A total shame -  - we ask for a late departure hotel was not full in February (low season) they told me rudely that I have to leave at 12!! When My wife asked for the check out bill at 11am they ask her again when exactly are we leaving! Unbelievable and finally funny  - all family waked up at 7:30am by room service by mistake!!  - despite renovation rooms seem old fashion and used;  - SPA is not beautiful compared to the Mansour one and treatments are done (for men) by man wearing a simple underwear- very strange experience;  - for lunch we took at the bar a Mamounia club sandwich just bread with tomatoes/salad- all others dishes are not the ones you expected in a 5 stars hotel;  - etc etc    The Pros: MARRAKECH IS AMAZING AND WELCOMING location is perfect beautiful hotel to visit and watch garden is wonderful cigars are top (but the lady at the Winston bar is just unwelcoming at all) the swimming pool is wonderful some staff are exceptional (night service French restaurant guys from the pool).

La Mamounia Marrakech,THE TRAVELLER wrote a review Feb 2019,50,Wow !! Winston got this one right !!,Winstin Churchill used to be a regular visitor and described La Mamounia as the best place in the world! - and that was before its €100m refurb ! I share his sentiment ! The refurb could have been disaterous in glitzing up an old palace but they have done a superb job- none of the old charm has gone at all. In fact they have enhaced it!  Situated within the old city walls La Mamounia is an oasis of peace and calm and tranquillity- entrance may be directly on the road but behind the main building lays 17 acres of beautiful garden areas.  The hotel is very old very up to date in terms of modern day living requirements luxurious but with an understated elegance. The ' standard' rooms are just wonderful !  Staff are very customer focused. Staying here is like being a private guest in an exotic Moroccan palace !

Not only were the staff wonderfully welcoming especially when initially there was not a table available outside they found us a wonderful cozy spot near the bar. Yes it is pretty expensive but the surrounds both in and out more than justify that it is a top class hotel.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Humsafar168 wrote a review Feb 2019,50,Our 3 day stay at La Mamounia,A very opulent and grand old hotel which reflects true Moroccan luxury. Our transfer to the hotel was in a brand new Porsche Panamera and upon arrival we received a delicious almond milk drink and dates. The room has been excellent and we were given a lovely bottle of Tattinger to celebrate a special occasion. We also received a sample of a room fragrance specific to the hotel to take away as a reminder of our time here. These small details made our stay extra special.    One aspect that needs to be addressed is the staff constantly asking if we were staying at the hotel. I appreciate that this is a tourist attraction and you have many people just coming in to take photographs but the staff really need to be a little more judicious about how much they harass people. It just comes across as arrogant and aggressive and we were made to feel unwelcome as a result of this. We will still give 5 stars as this should not detract from the overall stay although should be addressed by management.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Humsafar168

We booked a Deluxe room with park view and the room was astonishing.  Decided to have a buffet lunch at the pool side the selection of food and the quality was superb the service very attentive. After lunch we had a walk around the gardens that are a delight to be in.  The Hammam and the indoor pool were fantastic something you don't see anywhere else. Is like living in a palace in the ""Arabian Nights""  Dinner in the Maroccan restaurant was superb with wonderful service and great food. Coming back from the dinner I find in my room a wonderful chocolate cake and a bottle of champagne as a gift for my birthday.  It was one of the most memorable stays i have ever experienced.    However even tho it was a superior room no apology was made for the fact that the terrace outside the italian restaurant (below the room) was been cleaned with high pressure water causing constant noises through the day. Making unpleasant to sit on the balcony tho enjoy the view.    Also I found out later that the breakfast was not included with the price of the room this was not made clear in the room guide the inference being that the charge would only be made for room service. So despite the fact my partner only a tea and a toast he was still charged 420 Dhiram for his breakfast.  As well as this the service was inadequate: because the breakfast was served in the french restaurant instead of the pool side (the outside temperature at that time was 6C) there was not enough space to sit everyone and the waiters were struggling. My partner had to wait 10 minute for his tea and I had to wait even longer for my eggs benedict.  The buffet was really good and varied but again would be nice to give an option for someone that just want a cup of tea/coffe and a toast without being forced to pay the full price.  The bitter end of my experience in this hotel was to be chased by a porter after we had left the hotel and summoned back to the reception. Who questioned whether I took something from the minibar.

The property itself is great nice design I love the spa and Winston Churchill Bar. Check in was fine it was done on the seating area with nice treats.  Room lighting system is very complicated I must say in the late afternoon a housekeeper just went in to drop 2 mineral water bottles without even ringing the bell we were shocked as my friend was only wearing underwear from the bathroom. It was strange as we already have mineral water in the room. Other disappointed service was the breakfast room no one greeted us on the table not knowing what to do (drink menu or a la carte or combination) no greetings and explanation. So we explored ourselves the buffet selection was great but birds are flying around in the room too and eating food from the nuts and cereal section. Egg order was wrong (I asked simple omelette with mushroom and onion but I got scramble with tomato). The waitress keep coming to our table trying to clean my plate while I'm still eating and not finished. Turn down service we receive nothing (other hotel even 4 stars at least there's a chocolate)    As you can see from my other reviews I'm very easy going and generous with rating hotels. But with €800 a night the service we received was poor.

A day pass is all you need to experience it!,Not all of us can afford the large price tag of spending a night at the resort especially when trying to do different activities and excursions around the city. For people who still want to enjoy the resort I highly recommend a day pass that is available for purchase. Coming it at a little over $160 USD it allows you access to the gardens (stunning) the famous and Instagram famous indoor pool the outdoor pool and it also includes a 1 hour massage and a fabulous buffet lunch. My massage was fantastic and I was so relaxed. The spa itself is fabulous and you can lounge in the area for hours. The indoor pool is just as beautiful as it photographs. We arrived early to have an uninterrupted photo shoot so that we wouldn't have to share it. You are able to arrive as early a 9 a.m. and stay until 7 p.m.. Lunch is served by the outdoor pool and it is a buffet lunch. The food is spectacular and there is so much to choose from. Drinks aren't included so be sure to budget if you want any wine tea or soda.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Marcos Ribeiro wrote a review Jan 2019,30,"Beautiful hotel, poor service, disappoiting overall experience",Don´t get me wrong this is a nice hotel. It is very well kept our room was adequate indoor and outdoor pools were great as was the spa and the garden. The service however was below average and the overall experience disappointing. Let me start with check in. After a long wait in line (it seemed the front desk was understaffed to handle the number of guests) we received a very cold greeting (no “welcome” “how was your trip” etc). It was 1pm and the room was not ready (although the hotel had sent me an email asking our arrival time). But I guess I cannot complain about that as the regular check in time was 3pm. Still we could have been offered to leave our luggage in storage to have a tour of the hotel etc. As none of these were offered I volunteered to have my luggage stored and decided to take a walk. I asked front desk to give a call when the room was ready. I went back to the hotel at 3pm and the room was ready (they had not called me to let me know the room was ready as agreed).    Be aware that this is huge hotel. On the top of the two hundred something rooms there are lots of tourists who get in the hotel to visit it. As a result it was always crowded. All restaurants and bars were always completely full. It was almost impossible to have a drink at the bar (both the Italian bar the Churchill bar). The hosts of both bars were very unprofessional (the hostess at Churchill Bar outright unpolite). It seemed that they were doing you a huge favor to try to accommodate you. Staff at the pool was also unwelcoming. Overall you don´t feel welcome in the hotel. It seems the staff wants to get read of you as soon as they can. The only proactive behaviors of the staff were to confront us by warning us we were not allowed in certain areas of the hotel until they noticed we were hotel guests.  Of course there were exceptions. I had a problem with internet connection in my room and the IT guy who helped me was super nice and efficient.    All in all we were expecting a top notch hotel experience with personal service and attention and got ClubMed (or cruise line) experience. Nothing against those but this is just not what we expected from this hotel. Mandarim Oriental Aman Four Seasons (all present in Marrakech) seem to be better options if you want a big lux hotel experience. Otherwise go for one of the very charming riads inside the Medina (we had a vey nice experience at Riad Tarabel for instance.),Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"São Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcosC26
La Mamounia Marrakech,MarkCDesmond wrote a review Jan 2019,10,Wonderful hotel ruined by abysmal management,We stayed at this hotel over the recent Festive Season. The hotel itself is splendid and many of the staff work extremely hard at making this a five star experience.    We had some minor issues with the hotel failing to respond to emails dinner booking being lost airport pick-ups being late slow (forgotten) room service the removal of items from our room and an embarrassing debacle at the security gate over the hotel's unadvertised policy on bringing in food from outside. None of these would merit a one star rating - even collectively they may only warrant an angry 4 in protest. What does prompt this one star rating however is the way in which the hotel have dealt with these issues being brought to their attention.    Whilst a loose verbal apology has been offered no formal acknowlegdment of either the complaints raised nor the actions to be taken to remedy them has been given.    The complaints were recived with a level of defensiveness I have never previously encountered. By way of example a member of senior management with whom I spoke onsite advised that the hotel's policy of not allowing food from outside to be brought in would include prohibiting guests from bringing in bottles of water chocolate packaged food gifts and would also mean that they would not allow a child eating an ice-cream to enter with the ice-cream (I kid you not - he even asked with no sense of irony 'why would a child be eating an ice-cream'?).    Desipte a number of emails to the Managing Director the Director of Customer Relations and the Director of Reception asking to discuss our experience during our stay not one of them has responded.    In all the hotel made us feel invisible and unimportant. When we were actually 'seen' we were made to feel unwelcome and unvalued.    This is one 'five' star hotel that fails in all but the infrastructure of the building itself.    The policies of the hotel and the professionalism if not just the common courtesy of the senior management leave a great deal to be desired and fail to merit even a one star rating in my humble opinion.    Marrakech has many other five star hotels that are more than deserving of the rating and some outstanding four star hotels that both value their clients and deliver exceptional levels of comfort and service.    Mamounia is worth a visit for viewing but for a place to stay I would recommend you look elsewhere.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Greater London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkCDesmond

La Mamounia Marrakech,Jaime M wrote a review Jan 2019,30,Short visit,I went to the Mamounia to have a (ridiculously expensive) drink and visit the gardens and the Churchill bar (unfortunately closed at the time of my visit). Dress appropriately (smart casual) if you want to visit since they seem to turn away people at the entrance who look scruffy/too informal. The hotel has a lot of charm it is secluded and quiet and the gardens are very pleasant and well taken care of. The hotel even has its own vegetable garden! Besides the friendly waiter at the bar I only interacted with staff once at reception a lady who was extremely arrogant and unhelpful. I'm no sure the hotel is worth the price of stay but I don't regret my drink outside.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Brussels, Belgium",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaimeFnw
La Mamounia Marrakech,Unique Family T... U wrote a review Jan 2019,50,The most stunning grounds you have ever seen,We stayed at La Mamounia in Dec 2018. The hotel is set within 8 acres of stunning grounds complete with little lanes filled with lemon and orange trees olive trees roses bushes and stunning cacti.  La Mamounia consists of 135 rooms 65 suites six signature suites and 3 three-bedroom villas with a private pool which are hidden away in the gardens    Our lovely room had a great view over looking the pool and grounds and the rooms dim lighting made it very relaxed and romantic.    Left on our pillows was a bottle of the beautiful signature fragrance room spray specially created for La Mamounia by Fragonard.    The award winning 2500 metres-squared spa and hammam is an Instagram dream not to mention a relaxing haven to switch off and enjoy a soulful moment of tranquility.    Breakfast was served next to the large heated pool and due to the outdoor temperature being so cold in the morning the pool looked like a hot spring in Iceland.

The spa was amazing and everyone there was so nice and made us feel very comfortable.    The check in process where they invite you in and give you almond milk and dates was very nice sets a great first impression. Luggage appeared almost immediately.

We decided to stop for a beverage. We found a table in the garden restaurant/bar area. We ordered a glass of wine and a Cosmopolitan Martini and frites with a truffle mayonnaise. The service was atrocious slow to arrive the frites came without the truffle mayonnaise and with a bunch of jars of condiments (18 DHS). The drinks followed some time after! We tried to get someone’s attention and finally tried to explain the frites were incomplete and now getting cold. No one understood the menu and what the problem was. Finally after getting a menu and attempting again someone came to our rescue. A new plate of fries and more time later we got what was described on the menu. Also the Cosmopolitan was not up to standards.

A special thanks to Mohammed from Desert Day Tours who booked this for us during our tour with them (a special company for private tours in Morocco desertdaytours)  Without any doubt this is a number 1 hotel in Marrakesh. I’ve traveled a lot stayed in very good hotels but this one is really SOMETHING!!!!  The service is superb but it’s the design that takes the breath away. Rooms are very big each room has it’s one roof terrace with plunge and pool.

La Mamounia Marrakech,PUMBRIDGE wrote a review Dec 2018,40,"Well worth a visit, especially if you aren't staying here",We really enjoyed visiting this hotel and had early-evening drinks out on the terrace overlooking the orange groves.  The gardens are well-maintained with an impressive piped irrigation system.  The staff are efficient and well-trained as you'd expect at a 5-star establishment which likes to remind everyone that Winston Churchill used to visit and set up his artist's easel in the gardens to paint.  But oddly the managers are aloof and thoroughly unfriendly. As (free) day guests - you have to go through airport-style metal detectors and bag searches on your way in as there's a general fear of terrorism just below the surface in Morocco - we approached the desk in reception to ask a question and almost without looking up the bored and almost hostile manager told us to go away to another desk and ask the concierge or someone else as she was busy. She was filling in a form. We both thought she was thoroughly rude. That kind of attitude can sour an experience.  However we rose above that enjoyed touring the gardens using the loos sipping a ludicrously expensive bottle of mineral water and glass of wine and generally soaking up the ambiance on the terrace.  Don't bother ordering lunch. It'll break the bank. Just order a drink and you get bowls of nuts and olives and candied fruit - more than enough to see you through! Just make sure you stay ahead of the sparrows and house buntings which also think that the nuts and fruit are for them.  Good people watching and star-spotting. But it's expensive so pace yourselves. The pool is not available to non-residents but everything else is.  Strut around as if you own the place and you can spend a great day here. Watch out for the handle on the door of the gents just off the lobby.

La Mamounia Marrakech,PhilipStew wrote a review Dec 2018,10,5 Star..............................Not a hope,Its impossible to put into words how disappointing this hotel is to start with the only two positives the gardens are stunning and the staff in all depts are excellent pool boys reception staff waiters all great. The management however are dire totally disinterested in guests.  This is a hotel trading on its famous history. Any food or beverage you purchase is beyond expensive and at best average in quality. Breakfast is £35 per head lunchtime buffet almost £100 a club sandwich by the pool is £30 a can of coke £8……none of which are anything special though with breakfast you do get some free extra’s birds perch on the edge of the cereal serving bowls feeding & relieving themselves the pastries are alive with wasps but apparently that’s ok because ‘they aren’t flies’.  Eating options in this hotel are very poor there is a French restaurant which barely has one table occupied per evening a Moroccan restaurant which is slightly busier and an Italian which is the preferred eaterie by most guests the menu however is very basic and extremely expensive.  The rooms are very small and extremely dark the bathroom was tiny with an open shower that had no lip around the base and soaked the whole bathroom when you showered.  Halfway through our stay guest services called the room and asked how we were enjoying the hotel I explained we weren’t and that guests were totally exploited and everything was poor value. He thanked me for the comments and that was the last we heard. Any decent hotel you would instantly have been contacted by the manager but not here because nobody in the higher echelons care you only have to look at all of the negative comments here to see that there is never a management response. The whole management attitude is that while you are here we will rinse every cent out of you that we can.  When we were checking out I was presented with a bill of charges which included £130 of mini bar charges despite us having nothing at all from the mini-bar. It took 3 attempts for them to remove these charges firstly they credited half then three quarters and finally all of the charges were removed. We paid the bill and were told our account was clear.  The final insult from this sad apology of a 5star hotel is that 24hrs after departure my credit card was charged with £409.00 no advice or any communication from the hotel. I spotted this when looking at my online account so asked my card company to raise it as a dispute. The hotel were given 45 days to respond and explain the charge they didn’t respond at all so I have been refunded. I was told that overcharge complaints by this hotel are common place so they are not content with ripping you off while you are there they want another go when you get home.  This is a 3star hotel holding onto a 5star rating because Winson Churchill and a few other famous people stayed there decades ago. My recommendation is to stay somewhere else where they care about their clients and offer value for money.,Date of stay: September 2018,,"Kidderminster, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhilipStew

Architecturally stunning the accommodations were absolutely superb. We had a queen suite overlooking the gardens providing a beautiful serene view each morning. The spa services were wonderful and the indoor pool and jacuzzi very relaxing (it was too cold to use the outdoor pool as we visited in November but it is beautiful). There are magnificent outdoor gardens which are a must to explore.    There are three restaurants on site serving Moroccan French and Italian cuisine. We ate at ""L'Italien"" and had one of the best Italian meals ever prepared by a chef from Italy. The breakfast buffet by the outdoor pool is one of the best I have had beautifully presented with an incredible variety of local delicacies and pastries in addition to more standard breakfast choices.    The staff is wonderfully attentive and friendly. There are also so many little touches that make La Mamounia so special like daily fresh fruit and dates in your room complimentary perfume and leather key cases that are yours to keep at the end of the stay.

So 5 years ago it was great but a little bit less good.  The food at the Italian restaurant is really average but we had a good time.  This time we checked in had a bad room with the view at the service entrance. We asked to changed and they did change for us but we had to ask for the change. No food for the lunch at the buffet no brunch they made the buffet only for a special guest they were hosting as if we are not that special to them.  Don’t get me wrong this is a mythic place.

The hotel is lovely as was our room. The pool and outdoor dining areas are beautiful and the stunning garden is kept meticulously. We ate at Le Moroccain and the food was truly delicious. Having said all of this I do have some reservations. I found the serving staff at breakfast to be very congenial and attentive however the reception concierge and doormen to be too stuffy and cold. The ambience in the hotel is very dark but I would have appreciated much better lighting in our room and in the dressing area and bathroom especially. My husband and I have stayed in many hotels of this caliber throughout the world and still felt connected to the local culture yet I felt very little of this here.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Jennifer L wrote a review Nov 2018,50,Beautiful Hotel and a Wonderful Experience,I have been a guest at La Mamounia twice in the past 6 months-first trip with my husband and 2nd trip with a friend. Both 4 night stays were a wonderful experience. There was a lot of communication by email before our trip-the hotel secured our guide for a city walking tour purchased tickets for us to the Marjorelle Gardens and the Yves Saint Laurent Museum in advance and had them for us when we checked in provided a driver for tours to the Atlas Mountains and the beautiful seaside resort of Essaouira with an itinerary of things to do booked us for Fast track entry and departure at the airport helped with restaurant reservations and when I was disappointed with the view from our room on our first stay they gladly arranged for another room with a better view. The entire staff was so welcoming and helpful. The palace is beautiful and it's an excursion in itself just to walk around the hotel and grounds and take it all in. Upon arrival we were seated a comfy area (not standing at a front desk) and served delicious almond milk and dates. Someone from the front desk sat down with us and went over our reservation and checked us in. We had dinner in the Moroccan restaurant at the hotel and it was a fabulous evening. The food was delicious and plentiful and the live Moroccan music was an added bonus. The outdoor terrace setting was lovely. Breakfast by the pool was nice and there were so many food choices-breads and pastries fruit yogurt egg dishes made to order moroccan specialties and very good coffee! We booked the same category of room both trips-a deluxe (1 was a Koutoubia view and the 2nd a pool/garden view). The rooms have a separate toilet area separate shower bathtub single sink lots of storage to put our things. The bed was very comfy the linens and towels were plush and we were given bottled water and little snacks daily. There is an ATM machine and there are attendants outside to get a taxi whenever you need one-we were told the hotel uses particular taxi drivers who are at the service of the hotel only so we felt very safe and never had any issues with fares.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Happy Tales wrote a review Nov 2018,50,Gorgeous!,La Mamounia in Marrakech is one of the most exquisite hotels that I have ever stayed in. The attention to detail in the decor is stunning. The service is incredible.    Our room was quietly tucked away with no view yet was very quiet. We kept our shutters closed at night to avoid being awakened by morning prayers. The bed was very comfortable and we were able to unpack and spread out during our three night stay. My only complaint would be the dim lighting in the bathroom a complaint of mine in every hotel in Morocco.    My favourite feature of this hotel estate was the extensive gardens. The one km loop was a safe and delightful place to stretch our legs each morning. The large gym located in the centre of the garden is well equipped. I would have played tennis on the pretty red clay courts if I had brought along my tennis shoes. Racquets were available to borrow.    We ate at the French restaurant and had one of the best meals of our holiday. The breakfast buffets had everything we desired. The Italian bar was a fun place to meet friends for a drink.    We hired a local guide to take us to the Medina and the Souk. This was so helpful in navigating the busy streets and locating the best shops. We enjoyed an afternoon cooking at Maison Arabe.    This is a large hotel a short distance away from the chaos and energy of the Medina. I greatly enjoyed escaping the chaos and retreating to the serenity and opulence of La Mamounia. My one regret was not booking an appointment at the spa before we arrived as it was fully booked.

(In fine hotels at the suite level a butler will always initially escort the guest to see to their guest’s needs) The room lights are very complicated to figure out and are extremely dim. Bring a phone flashlight if you stay here. Coffee cups and mini bar are not refreshed daily. We had the pleasure of a 10pm “mini bar check” to see what we used prior to our check out the next am?????? What hotel does that? Never seen that one.    I have stayed in fantastic hotels. A supreme hotel is one that makes the guest feel they need nothing it’s all there. I don’t mind paying for this but find it extremely frustrating when I pay a lot for a suite and then I am nickel and dimed. We like amenities in our rooms and I don’t like having to call for more cups glasses mini bar refill (we had only one soda) more coffee pods (most were decaf which I don’t drink)    Come here for lunch or dinner to see the beautiful designs but staying here could be frustrating.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"San Diego, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sk8rLdy

La Mamounia Marrakech,Ferdi1982 wrote a review Oct 2018,50,True experience,"Again I will start saying that service is the main thing you can get and expect in a 5* property for me this is what luxury means. This time however I will tell my story and give name to my ""angels""  M. Atalaoui and M Alami in the concierge team were the ones who made my stay even more special and memorable.  As I was on this trip on my own it was nice to see friendly faces around the hotel and they were my highlight.  Travelling alone means that in order to take pictures I needed to improvise so I bought a selfie stick in London but realized that I forgot the top gadget on the top of it. So upset I mentioned this to them but not expecting anything as I was just leaving for a private tour. Once I returned to the hotel I was given the gadget already attached to my selfie stick.  I also intended to start my road trip in the next day early morning and I had a car delivered to the hotel. When I saw the car I was not too confident as I thought it wouldnt be a good option for the terrain I was planning on visiting. Again the concierge team and porters came to assist me and advise that I should change my car which I did as I took them though the places I wanted to visit.  Thank you very much indeed guys for being the friends I needed while staying there and for thinking of my well being well appreciated.  Not to mention the food at the Moroccan restaurant (didnt get the chance to try the others as my stay was a short one) The beef Tagine was to die for - so much I had it twice.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Fred T wrote a review Oct 2018,30,Fading memory,Mythical hotel in Marrakech but sometimes it’s not enough. The « new MAMOUNIA » totally refitted by Jacques GARCIA the French interior designer is still one of the best location to visit Marrakech but the hotel is in my opinion not as good as its historical reputation or certainly not what has been said recently the best hotel in the world. Far from that. I do believe I have visited many Palace in my life. I live in those at least 2 days a week so I do believe I have a a pretty good idea of what a Palace is.  La MAMOUNIA is well located ok the rooms are fine and the suites good but you certainly pay for that. The rooms are noisy( something to do with the ventilation system been told by the staff that it’s the same in all the hotel too bad).  Service is very very nice. That is for me La MAMOUNIA signature.  Food very average I should say basic.  Not to mention the Bar which is overcrowded and Dark the Italien restaurant with great reputation but very disappointing. I had the lasagne didn’t like..    la MAMOUNIA is at the image of it’s a club Sandwich all the ingredients are there but it has not taste. My expectation were great probably too high.    You can certainly go to la MAMOUNIA and have a great time the hotel is very well located the garden still very nice and the staff absolutely wonderful.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Ruth B wrote a review Oct 2018,30,Review of Dinner in Le Marocain,This was to be the highlight of our visit to the city. The hotel and the gardens are huge had no idea it was so big. Walked and walked through the place. The bar was packed as we walked through full of smokers.    The seats in Le Marocain are more like sofas around a table in small rooms of two tables this was so nice and comfortable. We were sat next to three quite noisy diners who had opinions about everything! Even the gorgeous Siamese cat that wandered around they thought this was disgusting and shouldn't be allowed.    The food was only okay literally nothing exceptional and as two of us are vegetarians we found it very meat heavy. The Moroccan salads were boring and bland eg boiled carrots drizzled with olive oil. Had tagines and cous cous for mains which were okay but slightly lacking flavour. The food at Comptoir was much much tastier.    And this place is pricey very pricey.

La Mamounia Marrakech,nickgreen1 wrote a review Oct 2018,50,"Incredible staff, amazing food but maybe a confused identity?",Spent a few days there in October half term. The staff were possibly the most friendly and attentive I have ever experienced. The pool side lunch is off the charts amazing. The pool gardens and general decor is all amazing.    To be aware of. The rooms are small - somewhat strangely I think for Marrakesh. The dinners in the hotel are nice but also smart. I think the hotel could do with a more chilled dinner option.    The location is amazing in that everything is less than 10mins in a taxi and you certainly don't feel like you are in the centre of town.    I suggest a confused identity only because the hotel markets itself as decor by the team from Hotel Costes in Paris and if you are expecting something similar then this is not quite the place. It is a big hotel and the gardens are open to the public so sometimes it can be busy in the day.    The bar at night time is terrific and don't get me wrong we loved the stay and I highly recommend - you just need a bigger room and expect accordingly.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nickgreen1

La Mamounia Marrakech,ObiterDictum wrote a review Oct 2018,20,Extremely Disappointed,I recently stayed at La Mamounia and was to put it mildly underwhelmed given my expectations. It was ridiculously expensive and not good value. I felt gouged at every opportunity. The hotel restaurants were too fancy for my resort tastes and more expensive than most of the high end restaurants in New York City (for example $85 for rack of lamb; $35 for pasta with tomato sauce; and $35 for a chicken club sandwich that was inedible). When I wanted to have a true Moroccan dinner I went outside of the hotel where one could have a delicious meal at moderate prices and in a less pretentious setting.    Housekeeping was inconsistent. Sometimes no water with turn down service. Dirty dishes not removed. Coffee supplies not replaced. Certainly not what one expects at a very expensive 5 star hotel. When we ordered room service one evening it took incredibly long and then the dishes were not what we ordered. By the time they had corrected the order my wife had already gone to bed. When I complained and requested that the room service charge be written off it took no less than 15 minutes of discussion and negotiation at the front desk. Even though the hotel had a record of what went wrong I was asked to summarize in writing what had happened. Most 5 star hotels would have been embarassed and volunteered to write off the charge without my asking.    The hotel is cavernous and formal and lacks charm and warmth. Overall I found it a bit sterile. The staff at the front desk acted in a robotic way and showed little flexibility.    We experienced all this pleasure for a room that cost well above $2000 per night    On the plus side there is a beautiful pool; the gardens are vast and beautifully manicured; and the breakfast buffets are bountiful and served near the pool in a gorgeous setting. Nonetheless this was not enough to compensate for the hotel's many shortcomings and we would NEVER stay here again. I realize that I am in a minority of reviewers but there are too many alternatives and choices in Marrakesh. If La Mamounia wants to see what 5 star service and quality really is they should send its staff to the Richard Branson resort in the Atlas Mountains.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Santa Monica, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ObiterDictum

La Mamounia Marrakech,Dave B wrote a review Oct 2018,30,Pool Pass,We were staying at a riad but wanted a nice hamman so booked in at La Mamounia. We'd considered staying here but I don't really like the big luxury hotels as they tend to be luxury by the numbers (which La Mamounia ended up being). The hammans were 1700 each but for 1600 each we could have an all day pool pass plus the hammans plus lunch - bargain! So the pool is great huge loads of loungers and it was a sunny day. Poolside service was a little surly. We had pina coladas - £18 each but it's poolside so we went with it. Lunch was buffet style at the pool restaurant. Pretty average. My husband's grilled chicken was raw (literally pink all through the middle). We told the waiter to tell the chef. Husband had swallowed some before he realised - gross. When we left the maitre d asked if everything was OK. we mentioned the chicken He said - ah ok. How was everything else? Literally no concern or as if raw chicken might be a bad thing? It wasn't a huge deal but it just showed how they didnt reaaallly care how you were - all by rote. And the whole place was just really soulless and corporate feeling - like a lot of these big heritage hotels are. AND - our bottle of Evian was £10 at lunch and my diet coke was £7. I don't mind spending money for some luxury and quality - but this is just greed and we felt really ripped off. The hamman was OK. Overall - was ok but we had a better time at one of the other resorts' pool.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M3697RVdaveb

After a seamless arrival we were escorted to a very well designed Executive Suite that offered not only traditional Moroccan charm but also everything expected from a modern luxury hotel.

La Mamounia Marrakech,egbauer wrote a review Sep 2018,50,the gold standard,"The Mamounia is the grandaddy of Morocco's luxury hotels--consistently excellent for almost a hundred years with a storied history. There's been a huge boom in luxury hotels in Marrakech and it would be fun to try some of the others just to have the experience. There are beautiful riads in the city some of them more modern or more stylish than the Mamounia where the decor is classic Art Deco and at least a couple aim to outdo the Mamounia in terms of price and luxury and exclusivity.    But La Mamounia holds its own.    Man what can I say about this place? It's gorgeous for sure. The gardens are huge and great for strolling the halls are hushed and luxurious the rooms are fantastic (even if the decor in ours had a whiff of the bordello about it--lots of red velvet paneling).    If you gan get the breakfast buffet included do. The spread is amazing and full of marvelous variety.    At one point I was struggling to make a reservation at an outside restaurant. I went to the concierge asked if they could help me and they made a call. Said essentially ""This is the Mamounia when can you find room for our guests?""--and all of a sudden the restaurant had a table for us.    The location is PERFECT. You can walk across the Koutoubia gardens right to the Jamaa el Fna which means you can access the medina easily and without having to deal with much traffic. And you're always a short walk/taxi away from the major historical sites too--the Bahia Palace the Saadian tombs.    The indoor pool is divine; you see it in a lot of the promotional photos and it's just as incredible as it looks. Swimming between the arches with rainbow light spilling through the windows overhead and not worrying about a sunburn is great.    The staff is excellent and helpful.    It's great.

This hotel known as the best in the country lives up to its reputation. The hotel has gone under an extensive renovation and it shows in the common areas the restaurants the bars the spa the rooms and the grounds. The hotel is surrounded by a 12th century wall and the second you enter you feel like you walked into a beautiful Moroccan palace and at the same time you feel like you just came home. Everyone that works there greets you with a smile and goes out of their way to make sure that your stay is a memorable one. The concierge staff was one of the best I have ever worked with meeting all of our groups many requests and changes and worked very hard to make sure we had the perfect Moroccan visit. Customer service at La Mamounia gets 5 stars.  The location is in the heart of the city. It is walking distance from the souks the medina and Jemaa El Fina square not to mention countless bars and restaurants. The hotel has 5 bars four restaurants and the extensive grounds have beautiful gardens and palm trees everywhere. The spa is one of the best facilities I have ever seen in any hotel . The spa is 27000 feet and has every treatment imaginable including an indoor pool as well as a fitness studio. It would be worth it to carve out an entire day just for the spa . The accomodations in all of the rooms are quite spacious. All of the rooms are marble floors and have local artowrk and mosaic tiles. The bathrooms are marble all with heated towel bars showers and plush terry robes.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Nupur54 wrote a review Aug 2018,40,Treat yo self,Staying at La Mamounia was a real treat. To have stayed in the same place as so many significant people in history was quite incredible and quite frankly made me feel cooler than I am. The hotel was luxuriously furnished with pockets of amazing architecture like the Moroccan monochrome courtyard. The long corridors were in this new and trendy dark spooky style which made walking down them towards your room almost like an optical illusion. The garden was beautiful and frankly completely stomped all over Jardin Majorelle. But the real difference was in the details- a freshly cut rose on each table in the lounge bar green velvet cupboard doors in the room genuine leather key card wallets those were the little things that really reminded us we were staying at a hotel that was far too expensive for our budgets.

They upgraded our room which we very much appreciated and we spent most of the day relaxing by the beautiful pool and at the gorgeous indoor pool. The breakfast buffet was nice by the pool but unfortunately we didn’t love our dinner at the Moroccan restaurant on the hotel grounds. Dinner was overpriced and my food came out warm (not hot).

La Mamounia Marrakech,Lrf2012 wrote a review Aug 2018,40,Beautiful hotel,It is a very beautiful hotel in the center of Marrakech! Lovely gardens and good service .    The only remark I have to make is regarding the car service from the hotel to the airport .  We were ready to carry ourselves because the bags were small and the distance short. The person took the luggage from the car to the check-in. ( trolley) When we arrived at check-in  the person asked for money and my daughter gave him 20 euros !!! ( we had 3 small carry-onsand one regular bag) He was not happy with the amount and asked me for more money . I did not have any cash left and just found a 20 dihram bill that I offered. He did not like it but finally said he would take it!!!! Not in s polite way!!!  I found this attitude not compatible in the high level of this lovely hotel.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Kim E wrote a review Aug 2018,50,Totoal luxury,We were treated to a two.night stay at La Mamounia as a gift. It lives up to its status as an ex prince's palace with the best of Moroccan architecture and decoration. We went fot a wonderful walk in its exhuberant gardens and the service was impeccable. Room facilities were extremely comfortable top class and I absolutely loved the spacious terrace overlookig the gardens and the mosque.    The personalised service was excellent and a pleasure to experience. The staff were obviously hand-picked and extremely well. trained.    Sadly the food and drink was a little too expensive for us or we could have enjoyed it more. We did eat in the hotel's Italian restaurant on the first evening and whilst the pasta was freshly made and excellent at over 30€ for a modest portion it is hardly value for money on my budget. But there you go it is a luxury hotel after all and there were plently of people there who could afford it.    It was a lovely experience and I'm glad I had the opportunity to stay at this beautiful hotel definitely one to remember.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Lanzarote, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/57kime

La Mamounia Marrakech,ravegan wrote a review Jul 2018,50,Simply the best,When looking at several 5 star hotels it was a no brainer to stay at La Manounia. The hotel itself is so beautiful and no detail is overlooked.  From the amazing gardens and pool area to the beautifully decorated interior and excellent restaurants. The breakfast by the pool was outstanding with so many The choices.  This hotel is expensive but we felt worth the splurge. The location is next to the Médina and we had a view of the Koutoubia from our balcony. There was a blackout shade you control from the bed that made for a good nights sleep.  We did a family trip with my brother who is very picky and is used to staying in nice hotels.  La Mamounia impressed him which is saying something.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Luis M wrote a review Jul 2018,50,a great experience,After a cancelled flight and lost luggage La Mamounia was an excellent hotel to be arriving to. The beautiful enveloping interiors are what transports you to a moroccan dream. The Service: from the driver (who rescued us in Casablanca) Concierge who was able to facilitate the location of our bags and back in our possession. Our suite with balcony was elegant and comfortable. The room was always refreshed with clean towels turn down and a swat team of invisible housekeepers . The spa is superb. I recommend the Hamam treatment followed by a massage. The male therapists I had were excellent. The food was delicious at every restaurantlounge terrace pool etc. . The wait staff was attentive charming and knowledgeable. The gardens and grounds are great for a stroll tea or a drink in the afternoon . The gym was impressive and top notch. it had a cool vibe.

There are not enough words to encompass how beautiful and luxurious La Mamounia is...it truly is magnificent. I've never experienced anything quite like it and cannot wait to come back. The staff are incredible so friendly and attentive and there for your every beck and call. They cannot do enough for you to make your stay perfect. The rooms where do I begin..breathtaking. Spotless and the beds are massive. They are traditionally decorated and the bathrooms are WOW. You truly feel like you are staying in a palace. The gardens are out of this world as is the pool area. You will feel like royalty during every moment and I cannot make a single complaint on the hotel. I feel like everyone needs to enjoy the La Mamounia experience it is magical and I cannot wait to return again. Thank you to all the staff you are gems. You are spoilt for choice in terms of food as they have three restaurants on offer - Moroccan Italian and French. The Moroccan is a must so you truly embrace the food of the culture. The Churchill bar has an impeccable feel to it I felt like I was in a James Bond movie. Do visit the spa as this will also blow you away. I had a full body massage and emerged as a new woman. Another thing to point out is that the entirety of the hotel has this beautiful aroma that fills the air - it is the scent of figs and you can buy the diffusers or room sprays from the shop which I recommend as when you can get home you will be brought back to La Mamounia every time you catch the scent in your home.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Ogg wrote a review Jul 2018,10,Big generic boring fake restort Las Vegas style in Marrakesh. Morocco has been edited out of this place.,Well there is a lot to say about this place. It was built in the 1920s with a lot of style but it has pretty much all been edited out in its various renovations. The rooms feature wall-to-wall corporate beige carpeting the furniture in the rooms looks like it came from Office Depot the A/C is blasting the pool is generic the breakfast experience is big and average the staff is constantly asking if you are staying in the hotel as you walk around and asking you what room you are in so you have to prove it to them. The famous Churchill Suite that could have been interesting has been redone and now features totally generic corporate stuff.. His one painting that is supposed to be on display there is not there anymore--and nobody knew when it would be back when we asked to see it. We also had to make several appointments to see that suite and when we finally got to see it our hotel staff guide came 25 minutes late and then asked if we were staying in the hotel or not. I was repeatedly told that I could not take pictures there in the hotel--and I asked why--and they said that I had to be a guest at the hotel to take photos. I was--yet they never seemed to believe me and I had to give them my room number and name to prove it over and over. It was infuriating. It is a big resort with only a pinch of character left in it. My family had a suite with 2 rooms--that cost us 5000 dollars for 2 nights. With that money we could have stayed in any other awesome riad for 2 months. I told some Moroccan friends about the prices--and they said that they could have lived for 2 years on that amount of money. It is outrageous how much La Mamounia takes from guests. Morocco and Marrakesh have been edited out of the place. We could have been in Las Vegas Dubai Palm Springs who knows where...any fancy golf club on the planet. A weird vibe. Also when we checked in we were each offered one date and one small glass of almond milk each. For 5000 dollars that was the welcome. Any poor Moroccan family from the medina or any casbah across the country could have done better--and do much better with their guests. It is a weird fake Morocco here. I will say that the gardens in the back of the hotel are beautiful and feature palm trees zinnia flowers fichi d'india citrus trees etc. They are nice but not spectacular and not artistic like the Jardin Marjorelle is. And it was clearly not worth 5000 dollars to look at them. There is also the Moroccan restaurant in the back to the left of the hotel--it is apparently part of the original hotel before it got rehabbed over and over. It is the only place around the compound that looks and feels like a luxurious sort of Morocco. But the corporate style and vibe takes over even there. The place needs to be rehabbed yet again--and Morocco and Marrakesh style and love of color and life need to be put back into it. For example the light brown generic corporate pool chairs need to be trashed in lieu of something colorful and fun. The rooms need to have native local crafts and stuff in them (not mass produced stuff from China) and they absolutely have to feature Moroccan furnishings in them. It could be amazing again...but it needs a manager/interior designer/cultural attache with an eye for color life and the amazing culture of Marrakesh. This place is definitely the biggest ripoff in Marrakesh--and possibly the biggest ripoff in Africa.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Rome, Italy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goodideas123
La Mamounia Marrakech,Omar Sav wrote a review Jul 2018,50,Day Visit was amazing,My wife and I wanted to visit the grounds of the hotel on the last day of our stay in Marrakech We were staying in a riad in the Medina. We walked from the square to the hotel through the park behind the koutubia mosque a gentle 10 minute stroll from the square. At first we were slightly apprehensive about visiting such an expensive and luxurious hotel however from the security guards at the door to the waiters serving us in the cafe everyone was incredibly nice The grounds were amazing the garden of the hotel is a sea of tranquility and is a vast size. A very nice get away from the hustle and bustle of the Medina. The prices in the cafe are as expected we paid 150Dhs for a coffee and orange juice however we received complementary nuts and olives as well as some pastry which was lovely and Ebraheem our waiter gave us a glass of ice cold water before we left.

La Mamounia Marrakech,DTV wrote a review Jul 2018,10,Visiting friends - treated like trash,Me and my boyfriend came to the hotel to visit our friends staying at the hotel from Canada which we havent seen for 5 years.    The hotel itself is stunning I must say. Beautiful garden beautiful lobby and pool area.    But the staff I must say was shocking me. At the entrance I was allowed to enter with open shoes - but my boyfriend in first round could not go with open shoes even after I told the connoisseur that our friends waited in the lobby for us and we were invited. It’s not like we showed up in trashy clothes I wore a dress and my boyfriend shorts and polo. I thought it was a joke.    After walking in by my self - he finally got to go with me. We planned to sit by the pool with my friends and the second they told we were their guests - the pool staff watched us like hawks like we would steal towels and in first round made a big show about us laying by the pool with our friends and couldn’t even talk to us himself but needed to approach our friend and look shady at us while. I find it very uncomfortable when you just come to visit and gladly want to pay for a water ect.    Never have I felt so “looked down on” by a staff and when we wanted to touch the pool water with our toes the staff almost ran to my friend to tell that we could simply not do that when not living here.    I find it very gross and weird that your friends pay 600 euro pr night for a room and then the staff treat the guests friends like homeless people staring at them for 2 hours.    We left after 2 hours haven’t been as disappointed as that day in a long time.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Liz M wrote a review Jul 2018,50,Worth it!,This hotel was gorgeous and as photogenic as you could ever imagine. The medinas in the city can be so exhausting so I was really glad we booked a hotel where we could escape the hustle and extremely touristy feeling of the city to relax for a day. Mamounia has a ton of history and character too its an attraction by itself so it didn't feel lame staying in the hotel for the day.    Activities  We decided to spend the whole day there because we normally don't splurge on hotels. We spent time in the pool and made spa appointments that were great. We also walked around the garden and they have a really cute vegetable garden that they use for some ingredients in the restaurant.    Staff  The staff was nice and helpful but they would ask for our room number a lot to make sure we were guests there which was a little awkward. We were always a little lost and confused about how things worked so I'm sure we looked out of place But maybe they could be smoother about getting this info without making people feel self conscious.    Room  Amazing view great bathroom and toiletries comfy.    Food  They have multiple restaurants so you have lots of options. They're pretty intimidating with prices at first but there are reasonable prices options on each menu so it's possible to do something more low key if you want. Ended up spending the most money on drinks which are 10+ for a beer and 20+ for a cocktail. Water was also around $10 a bottle which is a killer because it's really hot and you can't drink from the tap. I would recommend bringing in a few liters of water if you'd want to save 50 or so dollars on that. That way you can splurge on a spa service or something more fun.    I think my stay in mamounia was totally worth it so if you come to marakesh definitely stay at this hotel and take advantage of all it has to offer. Trust me unless you're in love with high pressure markets you will be grateful to have something else to entertain you after a day of touring the city.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New Albany, Ohio",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B6334TRlizm

I can't compare the two because we didn't see the FS but this hotel seemed so convenient and authentically Morocco to us. Just what I was hoping for. It's practically an oasis right in town. The gardens and grass tennis court were gorgeous. Even the live donkey helping the gardeners was charming. There were so many beautiful and surprising touches throughout it was delightful walking around. We loved the rooms and huge beautiful bathrooms. We had a fantastic city guide (organized thru the concierge) for two days that we still talk about. They also helped with restaurant suggestions that were perfect. We only wish we had stayed one more day to soak it all in. The spa is luxurious and my first hamman experience was very nice. My only complaint was the cost of food. I was under the impression the breakfast was included in our reservation and to my surprise it was not. We only drink coffee and have a small bite not worth it for us.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Kraijan S wrote a review Jun 2018,20,Classic hotel but quite disappointing in many ways,"Very impressed with hotel facilities. Huge outdoor pool beautiful and famous indoor pool several restaurants and bars (Italian Buffet French and Afternoon Tea) I stayed in a very well-done classic Standard room. The decoration and architect are just on point. Every staff is always smiling and nice to us.    BUT there are several things that I extremely disappointed:  1. No breakfast for a Standard room if you book it from another website. I do understand the policy but I think for this price (I paid around 600 Euro) they should include breakfast with it. I ended up to pay another 75 Euro per person for breakfast.    2. An air conditioner in my room is NOT working. When I checked in and got to the room I haven't check it as I quickly left the room. After I got back from a night out then to found out that an air con is not working. I called the reception and they said they will send someone to look. I was waiting for about 15 mins then I called the reception to ask them again if they send someone. But then again I had to explain everything over again and again.    3. While I was swimming in the indoor pool I spotted a mother and her teenage daughter walked into the room and got told by the staff that this area is only for guests and cannot take any pictures. They asked the staff if they can just walk around the staff allowed them and then walked away from the room. After they walked around they came to me and asked if I could get out of the pool for a second so they can take a photo of ""the pool"". I was just SHOCKED by that. In this kind of hotel I expected more security from the staff to not let this happened to their guests or to let their guests deal with these people. I reported to a staff at the front desk the day after. No feedback.    Only these 3 points that I feel so disappointed. The hotel is beautifully amazing. I just accidentally had a bad time.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Daniels-hanham wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Afternoon tea,Visited with our daughter who had been before. Amazing gardens and had the most relaxing afternoon tea. Roughly £18 British pounds each but you are having an experience so worth it in my opinion. Service was very good as you would expect and although this is nothing like a British afternoon tea all the cakes were very good although Moroccan mint tea is very sweet so ask for it without sugar (that is the way it is served anywhere in Morocco). As my husband doesn't like mint tea and we were not offered an alternative he ordered a coffee which was expensive but we were then given another plate of cakes so had our money's worth. Do dress up a little it is a 5 star after all so beach wear/flip flops not acceptable.

We chose the L'Italien since we were getting a little sick of Moroccan cuisine (although Moroccan cuisine is also divine). We ordered two starters: the Burrata and Calamari. Both were rich in flavour yet were fresh to the tongue. We ordered one pasta dish to share: Maltagliati that had vegetables chili and broccoli. It was a little on the plain side but the texture of the pasta was perfect not too chewy or soft. Then we shared the Branzino. Technically this was the climax of the meal but the fish was a little flavourless even though it was crusted with salt. But again the texture and freshness of the fish was very good. We finished off with coffee. Overall the dinner was a fancy experience and the food was decent.

La Mamounia Marrakech,MrDutchNYC wrote a review Jun 2018,40,Exquisite Experience,Our stay at La Mamounia at the end of May 2017 was truly the highlight of an extended journey. We intended it as a restful luxurious weekend and the facilities and service did not disappoint. It is a truly remarkable and beautiful hotel from the decor to the service to the ambience to the scents.    Important things to note:    Service - Perfect balance of formal and friendly. Be sure to avail yourself of services including airport pickup/dropoff and the concierge. Services were perfect friendly and efficient.    Rooms - We had 2 separate rooms including a Superior and a Deluxe. Both rooms were beautiful with all sorts of Moroccan details and decor. The Superior Room was definitely on the small side but ideal for a Single. There was no real view. For a couple over an extended period it might be a bit small. The Deluxe Room was more spacious and included a balcony with a view. This was more in line with expectations. The Superior was not a disappointment but the Deluxe was more in line with expectations.    Location - Not to be beat. It's just outside the Medina and there are always taxis ready and waiting.    Food - Food and drink is as expected top notch. I would say that the restaurants are more formal and the prices are high. There weren't really any Moroccan options though. The breakfast buffet was about USD 40 per person which is not unexpected but still considerable especially if travelling in a group. Casablanca beer was USD 10/bottle and a Pina Colada what was mostly air was around USD 29. Service is impeccable but be aware that prices are in line with some of the most expensive hotels in the world. If anything the formality provides incentive for getting out and exploring some truly fantastic restaurants in Marrakech like Cafe de la Poste and La Paillote.    Pool/Grounds - The pool is massive and the gardens are beautiful. Its a tranquil place to start the day and to return for an afternoon of relaxing after a trip to the Medina or elsewhere. The clientele is reserved and polished with few children running about.    Overall La Mamounia really is a dream-like place and definitely worth the effort. I'm very glad that we chose the hotel for our first trip to Marrakech and would gladly return.

La Mamounia Marrakech,1K wrote a review Jun 2018,10,Treated like second class visitors..,"I'd longed to visit the famous Mamounia for years and we went for drinks to celebrate my daughters birthday. We couldn't book but we're told just to show up so along we went. The security and door staff were charming and we were stunned by the lovely viewhe terrace... And ood. And stood.. Eventually we approached the hostess to ask for a table for dinner. She barely acknowledged our presence but stiffly replied ""nothing available"" and went to walk away. I asked if we could wait and she said OK but didn't want our name and left us. I wished we'd left there and then but we naively ploughed on and went for a walk around the beautiful gardens and returned a little while later.  There were a few vacant tables then so we checked with a waiter and sat down. Took quite a while to be acknowledged and served but the drinks were nice and it was lovely to finally be sitting on the terrace of the famous Mamounia.  We were finishing our drinks and chatting together (just the two of us) when the same hostess we'd met on entry approached our table with a spare chair and without a word placed it between my daughter and me and walked off. I was stunned. It was the rudest gesture the table had a gap on the opposite side we were mid conversation and the inference was plain.. We felt her comptempt for us. I was so upset I went to speak to her but she was busy so I spoke to her colleague who was apologetic but it was really too late.  The place is beautiful but the attitude of this girl was miserable and we'd never return.  The staff need to be aware that they shouldn't judge guests just because we are not residents has no bearing on our capacity to have the means or inclination to visit another time. They need to know that for some a visit to Mamounia may well be a long held dream and something to share with a loved one on a special occasion.  The judgmental attitude rude behaviour and lack of follow up has prompted me to to write this review in the hope they speak to their staff and tell them that they ruined what I'd hoped to be a beautiful memory on a special day.",Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Singapore, Singapore",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Expedition802649

While the room was lovely everything else about the dinner was not the waiters were snobby the food was marginal wine list overpriced and when we got the bill we saw that water had been charged at $30 a bottle!

I cannot say enough about the beauty of the grounds and staff. The grounds are everything you have read and more. It is hard to believe bustling Marrakech is around you. From check-in to check-out service exceeded our expectations. I especially want to thank Asma at the Italian restaurant for making us feel so welcome throughout our stay Hesma for the best massage I have ever had.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Gemma U wrote a review May 2018,20,Discriminated upon,Such a shame to have to write this while I am not staying at this hotel my husband and I visited their public gardens today 9/5/18. After a full morning of sight seeing (gym shoes and joggers) we went up to the entrance (spoke to Mohammed and Manoi) only to be told that we could not enter with a backpack and that they didn’t have a storage unit for the garden visitors. I fully support the security measure that they have to take and understand that several places have this no backpack policy. But we asked if lockers or storage was available and told us no to come back another day we also had other questions about the day pass and the personnel was very short. We felt liked they looked down upon us and didn’t want us to be there. So we went down the street to the pearl sky lounge for a drink and then arranged our belongings to get rid of the backpack. We went back and got in. But when we were exiting we noticed that they were letting other people in with backpacks and allowing them to be stored in a closet right by the entrance. It’s really a shame that we were told a different story whether it was because our appearance the language barrier or whatever the case may be. Hate pointing this out but we are people of color and those that were accommodated were Caucasian. In the hospitality world I think it’s important to show all your guests a level of equal respect no matter the race especially in a city like Marrakech which is flourishing in tourism from all over the world. By no means do I intend repercussions against the personnel but that management sets the tone about the level of respect that is to be given to all guests.

It’s an impressive property with a rich history.  It’s huge with nicely kept gardens and multiple pools.  I had a nice suite overlooking the moisture fully restored the cast iron heaters were the only remainder of its past.  The sheer size of it made it feel impersonal service did very little to change that! It was slow and indifferent.  The pool at the spa is really nice. I had a treatment but it felt hurried and meh!

La Mamounia Marrakech,Deepak S wrote a review May 2018,10,Please don't stay here - way too arrogant and they don't care,"To be honest - this hotel comes with a lot of hype and the real question is whether that hype is real or just fabricated because of its history and seeming opulence in the general realm of hotels. In my opinion - this was all hype and not worth the stay. However in full disclosure my opinion is based on several factors intrinsic to what we wanted to do at the hotel . In other words why we decided to pay a higher price to stay at the hotel for one night when there are so many amazing options inside the Medina . Because of the reviews of the hotel and more importantly it's standing in social media- we decided that staying here would allow us the opportunity to take some wonderful pictures of the hotel itself. In other words we decided to treat the hotel beautiful as it may be as sort of a museum or famous historical landmark. To our disappointment we were not allowed to take any pictures. When asked why they could not give us a reason and said only for magazines (we were allowed to take pictures with  our phones however). We just regular people . This and some other things made us feel that even when we paid to stay here we were not welcome to even take pictures and treated more like trespassers as opposed to valued guests. That really bothered me. Yes the service is good - yes the interior is beautiful- yes it's historic- but what good is all that if you don't feel welcomed . We were not asking for a lot - just to spend the day there as a ""fancy escape"" from real life. I guess the most disappointing thing is the realization that the  hotel is catered to such a high quality of clients and guests that it didn't matter to them either way. And I don't believe that affects them either due in part to all the reasons mentioned above. It seemed like class division at its finest - all in part to the simple ability to take photos in the Grand Salon.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Heidi L wrote a review May 2018,30,Plan your visit,The hotel was gorgeous . I feel like the hotel could have done a better job warning guests of things to be careful of. We did our research but after speaking to people about my trip seems like others had similar situations.    The hotel should have its own taxi service or drivers that are trust worthy. . We asked for a tour and they provided a taxi . The hotel provided us with a taxi that wasn’t officially registered and the cops ended up pulling us over. I believe there is a specific color to look for when selecting taxis. We missed our tour as a result.Do your research and find your own proper tour guide so you don’t get offered a cab or unofficial cab.    Also keep in mind cabs are not regulated and uber doesn’t exist. Cabs quote different prices all the time and would sometimes change things up on you. several taxi cabs would fight over us and we were so scared to jump in cabs with angry drivers that we actually ended up walking late night which brings me to the next issue.    We got lost in the Medina at night and several people were asking for money to give us directions to get out. Once you go into the Medina it’s like a maze. I have traveled all over the world and I have never visited a country where people would tell you are going the wrong way and ask for money. They also warned us that tourists were not allowed in the area we were walking. By the 5th person that came up to us we ended up paying to get out because the motorcycles were driving fast in small narrow streets in the dark. We had just seen an old lady get hit by a motorcycle so I just wanted to get out of the maze.    Just sharing a few things to keep in mind since it was my first time and I’ve never met anybody that has been to Morocco. The hotel is really nice and classy but once you step out you should be aware of a few things. Because of the bad experiences we had due to the staff providing bad cabs more than once I’m giving a lower rating. Some of these things are out of their control but I read others mentioning similar issues with cabs and getting lost.    Food was great but expensive. The pick up and drop off at the airport was exceptional service. Rooms were comfortable and modern. The hotel has a casino next door. Great location. Smells really nice.    If you hire your own tour guide and driver you should avoid the issues we had.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Rimifoodie wrote a review May 2018,30,Quite bad,Dear readers  I stayed in so many 5 stars hotel in the world but la mamounia is definitely not a 5 star hotel. I would rate it 4 (minus). The hotel didn’t even reach half of my expectations.  The most sad thing about La Mamounia is the food (except the Marrocan restaurant which is good) all the rest pool menu is just few dishes (not up to 5 star hotel) the food comes dry not seasoned bad plating and reminds sometimes airport cafe style.  Even simple French fries came 4 times out of 5 undercooked.  The Italian restaurant is very bad the fritters tasteless the sauce that came with tasteless. Octopus carpaccio came dry and with a very fishy smell. Tried it and gave it back straight away.  We asked for the meat to be rare it came well done (see picture)  Room service my dirty glasses were in the room for 3 days until I put them out of the door. A lot of dust in places difficult to reach.  The stuff is also not up to the level. When I wanted to book the Italian restaurant for 7pm I was told that the restaurant opens at 7.30pm. But of course the restaurant opens at 7pm.  And the gym very dirty all the machines dust on the floors some weights are missing you would have 12kg and 18kg weights but 14-16kg would miss. See the picture of the machine enclosed when I say the machines are dirty.  Another disturbing thing for a 5 star hotel is the tourist traffic. So many tourists are coming to take pictures of the hotel feels sometimes like in the train station.  So in general very disappointed. Expected much more.  But I have to say that all the people working in the hotel are very nice friendly and polite.

The restaurants didn't quite match the standard of the setting however and I'd suggest you eat elsewhere for dinner.    Room location is very important in determining the enjoyment of your stay. Rooms that face the garden are wonderful; light airy and romantic views in the day as well as night. However rooms that face the interior are dark and have truly depressing views.

Bland and not distinctive. Not really an “experience “ per the description in the prix fixe menu. Soon after our server poured the first glass of a $100 bottle of wine a bug flew into my glass. He dumped the wine and brought a new empty glass but made no offer to replace the wine. One sixth of my wine investment was gone because of their insect. I guess their guests are responsible for any bugs in the food. The non-smoking bars were full of smoke.

La Mamounia Marrakech,bedandy wrote a review Apr 2018,50,Among the mythical world class hotels that still live up to their reputation,La Mamounia made our Marrakech stay the most wonderful we’ve had in our lives. The hotel service is close to flawless and when it isn’t the kindness and warmth that radiates from everyone makes up for whatever little bother one may have. The grounds are gorgeous the place is an lush oasis of calm and beauty within a busy city. Every stroll or excursion outside had us running back with glee to the hotel either to enjoy our beautifully appointed room overlooking the garden (we did ask for a room change when we came because the city-side rooms have beautiful views but are a bit noisier and I am a light sleeper) or to take a drink at one of the several outdoor terraces lounge at the pool have a soothing body treatment at the spa. Let’s put it this way I shopped more at the hotel boutique stocking on their olive oil candles diffusers and even bringing back a bathrobe than I did anywhere else in the city.

La Mamounia Marrakech,SusieCR wrote a review Apr 2018,50,"Stunning, one of my all time favourites BUT some service issues to iron out!",There is no mistaking it La Mamounia is a legendary hotel that is located in magnificent gardens with charm wonderful atmosphere and beautiful rooms. The hotel is perfect. The room are well appointed the decor is traditional but not kitsch classic but still in keeping with the Moroccan culture and the bathrooms are beautifully finished. I loved waking up int the morning and sitting on the lovely balcony listening to the birds in the trees. This wonderful experience comes at a high price. A high price that is in keeping with The Ritz in Paris or The Savoy in London. This is how it should be ONLY that sometimes the service level does not reflect the luxury prices. This tends to be a challenge all over Morocco but I don't understand why this issue is not being adequately tackled at La Mamounia. For example the concierge is curt and unhelpful. We requested our car to be brought to the front of the hotel with 30 mins notice. When we arrived the car was not there and we were told rather rudely that we would 'just have to wait'. Each interaction with this person was worse and we complained to the hotel but I don't feel that complaints are taken seriously hence why the issues are never resolved. Oddly enough friends of ours had the same negative experience with the concierge last May (perhaps not the same person but the same desk). Another issue was when we arrived for our afternoon cocktails on the terrace it was difficult to get someone to serve us. When I went looking for a waiter they were all gathered in the bar chatting?! How is that 5 star service? I also think breakfast should be included in a room rate of €1000 per night. The quality of the breakfast buffet is just ok again not similar to other similar luxury hotels.

It is quite simply one of the most beautiful and gracious hotels in the world. What truly sets it apart from almost every other super luxe hotel is its extraordinary architectural detail. Everywhere you turn there is an intricate marble mosaic a delightful courtyard a hand painted wooden door or ceiling a leather-covered elevator car. Even the bathrooms near the pool area are spectacular. Accompanying this splendor is a serious price tag. Your afternoon spritz will set you back $35. But it is something special to wake up in this historic treasure stroll through the magnificent gardens breakfast by the pool and then retire to the spa for a hammam. You'll feel like you're on another planet altogether. Service is as you'd expect impeccable (they even surprised my son with a cake delivered to his room on his birthday).

The breakfasts are also spectacular with a staggering variety of foods and a pool side location which is divine.

We ate at 3 of the restaurants and all were really good but the Moroccan restaurant was outstanding. The pool is set in the gardens which are extensive and tranquil.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Longfur wrote a review Mar 2018,20,Surprisingly poor service - 9 things they got wrong in 2 hours,We visited this feted hotel for dinner at one of their restaurants - Le Marocain. We were early so went for a drink at the buzzy looking Churchill bar. Or at least we tried..    Their level of service started off badly and didn’t improve. I’ve totted it up and there were 9 customer service 'bloopers' in just 2 hours.    1. We had a lot of trouble getting the attention of any of the numerous bar staff. The women who give out the menus seemed to be circling the bar in a confused manner only stopping to whisper to each other.    2. When one finally gave us the drinks menu I asked if we could order straight away. She said 'yes' then turned on her heel and walked off.    3. Not easily put off when it comes to chasing a glass of champagne we intercepted a passing waiter who took our order. He then stopped for a chat with the man at the table next to us - a long chat. After a good 5 minutes of this I realised we were not going to get our drinks anytime soon and stood up to leave. We’ll take our chances at the restaurant I thought. None of the staff seemed to notice that we were abandoning ship.    4 Now feeling a little miffed - first impressions count you know we made our way through the gardens to the restaurant. The lady policing the booking sheet had some trouble finding our booking. We pointed it out to her ourselves and she said something along the lines of 'It's okay you may enter'. Were we meant to feel grateful?    5. It wasn't busy yet they sat us right next to another couple in one of the small side rooms which felt a bit uncomfortable for all concerned. Thankfully they turned out to be a lovely couple and we had a good chat.    6. The wine waiter appeared speaking French - and then swapped to English after a couple of exchanges in a rather supercilious manner. Hmm a bit rude I thought. By this point I was ready to leave but the glass of champagne turned up quickly and my wife talked me down a bit so we stayed put.    7. The food was not memorable - apart from the amuse bouche - which was amusing for the wrong reasons - it looked like some sort of boiled courgette with foam on top.    8. A traditional Moroccan band appeared rather noisily after an hour or so and stopped at our nook. They didn't look very happy in their work though and it felt a little awkward.    9. When we asked about a courtesy car we’d been told was available back to the Four Seasons the receptionist happily pointed out this wasn't the case but we could get a taxi. So we travelled back in a knackered old sharabang with alarmingly bad brakes.    Overall La Mamounia gave us the impression of a place trading on a fashionable reputation with service levels trailing far behind. We were pleased to get back to The Four Seasons - where the service was impeccable over the 5 days we stayed there.,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Kent, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Longfur

La Mamounia Marrakech,greatplainave wrote a review Mar 2018,10,The worst hotel experience,"Most disappointing hotel experience ever. My hotel room was the smallest one I had ever been in - no place to open my suitcase except on the bed but then what? Tiniest bathroom no place for toiletries. Smallest toilet ever - could not close toilet door because it hit my knees. The tiny patio looked out at the air conditioning units of adjacent rooms. Strangest room lighting system with indecipherable ""flick"" switches very confusing. Internet connection frequently disconnected. Hotel was beautiful but cold and museum-like. Prices for everything were through the roof exorbitant. If money is no object you may like this place but it certainly does not feel like you are in Marrakech or anywhere in Morocco. More like Monaco or Palm Beach or Manhattan. Two plusses: the staff were very nice and helpful; and the food was good.

If you want to treat yourself this is the place to go. Whilst sitting next to the pool you can have unlimited lobster oysters grilled prawns and fish cooked to order meat galore and puddings to die for. It all comes at a price but it it totally worth it for a unique gastro fest! For all you foodies out there it is definitely worth it!  Ideally the door staff would be more welcoming to their day visitors. Upon arrival we had to go through a metal detector and our water bottles were confiscated.  As non residents we were discouraged from walking in the gardens post lunch which was a huge shame. If we wanted to use the pool we would have had to pay an additional £50 which seemed rather extravagant and a shame bearing in mind it is a huge pool and there were loads of unused beds.,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CRenton_13

There was lots of choice and everything we ate was fresh and tasty. It is quite pricey but considering it is eat as much as you like it did not seem an outrageous price and included one drink.    It was surprising that having paid for the brunch you were not allowed to stay around and relax on the grounds or use the pool.

Stunningly beautiful with nice gardens huge layout this is all you'd expect from the best of Marrakech. Great bar nice places to sit out stunning indoors and outdoors pool (a bit cold in Feb) a nice enough breakfast. The rooms are nice we were upgraded from a standard and while it was very nice and quite spacious we were above the kitchen so we could smell cooking sometimes (not very nice). Walking distance from the Koutobia  Jama el Fina and the Souks so location is great. Concierge was nice I was a bit confused by the ""doorkeepers"" they always looked a bit skeptical when we entered  but we gave them a room number and they let us in (how do they know it's genuine???). And why are others not allowed for a drink at the bar? Perhaps they are trying to control throngs that might enter to see the gardens (don't bother they are very very nice but there's a lot else to see in Marrakech). Note a taxi back and forth  always bargain since they quote you 4 times the usual rate once they hear you want to get here and are likely a guest.

This hotel is no longer up to the standards of the old La Mamounia and even what one expects when booking a 5 stars hotel.    This is what I found last week:    - staff lost my sweater upon arrival when transferring my bags from the lobby to the room.    - got awaken by hotel reconstruction works at 8:15am    - no fruit of the day in the room (as it is standard in this hotel) instead I got forgotten detergents on my bad when I got back to my room in the evening.    - breakfast cost more than 40€: served outdoors even when temperature is 7 degrees like I got one of the days. Additionally staff removed heaters as some ran out of gas and “other customers also needed it”.    - no labels in buffet food for breakfast: no celiac/lactose intolerant options.    - tourists from outside the hotel constantly invading swimming pool and taking pictures.

La Mamounia Marrakech,RajeevNagpal wrote a review Jan 2018,50,Luxurious living,La Mamounia    Luxurious living is probably the best description for this really upscale hotel in the heart of Marrakech.  Your taxi drops u at this small arch like entrance and as u pass thru this secured arch u enter a small garden adorned by beautiful trees and marbled floors These floors are well lit at night spotlighs. There are some areas on the ground covered with natural grass giving it a garden like appearance.    Don’t miss the covered square in this garden with four well lit pillars often filled with subjects having themselves being photographed as it makes amazing pictures.    You then enter the hotel through tall doors which are guarded and secured by equally tall guards as they open the doors for you.    Lobby itself is massive with plush carpets on the floor marbles on the edges and walls with soft textures. It is indeed quite ornate with extensive artwork on its walls.    You are received by the host staff who will make you comfortable with a soft drink as they do the paperwork.  We had the standard room with a king size luxurious bed with a very impressive headboard. Room was large with extensive decorations with a sitting area and lots of room to walk around.  Bathroom was huge with marbled shower on one side and a large bath tub on the other side. In the center is this huge sink with hot and cold waterToilet and bidet are housed in a separate adjacent area with a seperate door.  There is also a seperate area to keep your bags and hence your living space is not cluttered with bags.  It has several restaurants indoors and outdoors with amazing service.  Food was delicious and well served both as room service and at the restaurants. Healthy breakfast with egg white omelette and cereal was a great choice and was enough to feed two.  In the out door restaurant tiger prawns with bok choy were truly delicious  Although pricey it is worth the stay and experience luxury in a kingly style.,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Chicago, Illinois",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RajeevNagpal
La Mamounia Marrakech,Johanna F wrote a review Jan 2018,10,High Hopes,When I first arrived to the hotel I was seated on a couch and was left there for 15-20 minutes. No one greeted me or asked me to check in. Another couple who were white arrived a few minutes after I did and were attended to quickly. I pointed this out to the front desk and after expressing my disappointment in being left unattended for so long someone finally checked me in. The person who checked me in tried to charge me again for my stay and I had to show proof that the room was already paid for. After apologizing I was finally shown to my room. Throughout my stay I felt like a second class citizen. Even though I paid the same amount as other guests it seemed as though white guests were given more attention. I had to verify that I was a guest at this hotel numerous times while I saw other guests roamed around freely without being questioned. This was supposed to be a special trip for my mother and I but I felt as though the hotel ruined our stay in Morocco. The room was beautiful but did not make up for how uncomfortable we felt at the hotel. I would not spend close to $2000 again to stay at a hotel that is not welcoming.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Geoff C wrote a review Jan 2018,30,"Gorgeous setting, but overpriced and lacked atmosphere",We didn’t stay at La Mamounia but we wanted a bit of glamour on our trip so headed there for cocktails after dinner    The entrance is gorgeous and looking a wonderful at night. The hotel interior is very glamorous and blends high end hotel with Moroccan styling well. The gardens at the back also look great at night and I’d love to see them in the daytime    The only thing I’d say is that the cocktails/ drinks were massively overpriced. I’m not talking for Marrakech just in general. It’s more expensive to have a drink here than it is at Claridges or the Savoy. So be prepared to part with £60-70 for two drinks    Also there wasn’t any atmosphere in the bar when we were there. It’s quite a large area and was only a third full in the main room and even though their was a piano player it just felt a bit flat. It was even quieter round by the bar    I don’t mind spending that kind of money when there’s a real buzz bit sadly it was all a bit flat and none of the energy you get in the top London hotels    Maybe we were unlucky with the night we were there or maybe that’s just how it is,Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Taplow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeoffC590
La Mamounia Marrakech,luxtrav26 wrote a review Jan 2018,40,Authentic Moroccan Style Hotel In The Heart of Marakesh,Beautiful hotel centrally located in the heart of Marakesh. I stayed here with my family for 4 nights. Our junior suite was a bit dusty and dark. Not the best lighting. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was spacious and had every amenity available. Every night at turndown we would receive a lovely plate of fruits or a delicious chocolate treat which was a nice touch.  We had breakfast at the hotel every morning. Since the hotel was fully booked it was a bit crowded. Breakfast included a large selection of fresh pastries fresh juices fruits and an egg station. There was also a corner filled with Moroccan delights. Quite a lot to choose from however the wait staff could not handle the amount of hotel guests. They were definitely overwhelmed. We experienced the same problem while having afternoon tea on the terrace.  The hotel gardens are beautiful. We enjoyed walking through them every afternoon.  The spa was a bit dark to my liking my service felt rushed and was not what I expected.  We dined at the Italian restaurant which was our favorite. It was quite pricey but the food was fresh and delicious. Our waiter Sofian was very friendly and helpful.  The hotel concierge was not the best. They had suggested several restaurants outside of our hotel which were not up to par. We also experienced a terrible tour guide via the concierge and we were charged $250.00 for the two hours he spent with us.  Overall the hotel is a nice Authentic Moroccan experience. We definitely enjoyed our stay but would look into a different property if we decide to return to Marakesh in the future.,Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luxtrav26

La Mamounia Marrakech,Mlevine1963 wrote a review Dec 2017,30,Disappointing given its reputation and price,When we arrived they “upgraded” us to garden rooms. The garden rooms are below grade and slightly larger than the other rooms which is nice but they are dark and the “walk out”terraces don’t lock from the outside so you can’t really use them as exits. The reason they are larger is because rooms upstairs have their terraces on your extension so you hear a lot of moving lounge chairs on your heads. And the lights make no sense. You can turn all the lights off easily but we couldn’t leave the bathroom light on without a light coming on in the room. The basic service in the hotel was very friendly and caring but they don’t pay any attention to the “do not disturb” signs in the afternoon and will knock on your door and walk in to deliver water despite the signs hanging outside. Maybe hang a tie on the door? The restaurants were impeccable. Good food excellent service. The bar while nice was ridiculously expensive. $55 for a shot of Patron Anejo. My wife and daughters went to the spa. They were charged extra for private treatments but they were only given one shower for more than one person which slowed things. They were taken 15minutes late which was no big deal but then they were left alone for 20 minutes in the steam room. They finally went outside to see what was going on but their “Private” spa person was not around. Later after the treatment they were led to a room and given juice presumably to relax. Not a minute later they were rudely asked to leave as a VIP was arriving. When my wife complained to the front desk they were very apologetic but they had no control over the spa. The breakfasts are nice but bring a coat in the winter. They are outside. And they make no effort to keep the cereals and breads away from birds. My daughter went for the Cheerios but a bird was walking in them pecking away. When she pointed this out to the staff they smiled and said that nature was wonderful. They did not however change the bowl. All of the apocalyptic books and movies start with a bird flu. We avoided the cereal. Finally on checking out there was a phantom minibar charge on the bill. Beware. I am sure the hotel is better in the off season but overall for our stay i wasn’t impressed.,Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mlevine1963

I was so very disappointed because I was looking forward to it. I was really surprised with the quality of the food at this first rate hotel especially since it was exceptionally expensive. I could barely finish my meal.    And there are cats everywhere at this outdoor restaurant. I mean I am sure they are harmless but they beg for food and try to jump on you if you ignore them when they put their paws on your lap. None of the very many waiters standing around tried to stop them. People must be feeding their food to the cats.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Iloveboutiquehotels wrote a review Dec 2017,50,Authenticity Defined,The minute I stepped out of the airport security area I saw a well dressed gentleman with a La Mamounia sign inside waiting for me to pick me up. As we walked towards the exit I saw the rest of the drivers from various hotels and roads holding up a sign. I asked my driver why was he the only one inside? He said La Mamounia is the only palace allowed inside the terminal for pick up. I asked if Four Seasons or Royal Mansour can greet guests inside and according to him no! I felt so special right from the minute I stepped out!    This was a splurge stay for me and while it is much more ideal to go with someone I travelled alone. The hotel is like a fortress and felt very safe the security is quite strict to the point they search your shopping bags extensively. I was a tad upset how rough they were one of my gifts got roughed up and the box dented...    The room was very ornate with mosaics and ceilings painted I kept hearing it’s dark but it worked. That sort of room shouldn’t be illuminated excessively with light coloured walls and bright lighting. The two balconies were so relaxing to have I woke up watching the sun rise and had a distant view of the Atlas Mountains. It was pure luxury.    Bathroom was lovely a nice rain shower and separate bath tub and generous size amenities.    After arriving I immediately went to get a spa treatment I selected the La Mamounia Hammam and massage. It was my first time experiencing a Moroccan style Hammam in Turkey they wash off the scrub while you lie there but in this instance I had to get up and wash off in the shower each time. If I didn’t have a comparison I wouldn’t think much about it but I think I would have been more relaxed if I didn’t have to walk over naked to wash myself off a few times. The treatment room and facility was beautiful and spa attendants were fantastic.    I had dinner at La Marocain it was one of the best meals I had in Marrakech. Much better food than Dar Yacout that everyone raves about. Breakfast by the pool every morning was fantastic I miss the freshly squeezed OJ...the server kindly explained to me the Moroccan dishes I love trying what locals have for breakfast. The bread table as soon as you walk in was heavenly.    The location is amazing just steps away from everything. I would go back in a heartbeat.,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled solo,"San Diego, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Iloveboutiquehotels

La Mamounia Marrakech,Renato N wrote a review Dec 2017,40,Beautiful hotel,The interiors of the hotel are very stylish and sophisticated counting with dozens of different morrocan style decorated spaces most of times with low light and dark colors. The spa is marvelous and the pools are a unique spectacle and must not be missed. Massage is a plus as we are pampered in all ways. Breakfast is very pleasant. Not many options as in other arab countries but the buffet and a la carte menu have enought delicious options. My room had a wonderful view of the gardens and the pool and watching the sunset over Marrakech from the terrace in unforgettable. The size of the room is standard I believe to have a large room we must book a suite. Amenities towels slippers bed and pillows were all perfectly comfortable.  One suggestion is to hire a private car of the hotel as they offer professional guides as drivers. Taxi in Marrakech is a horrible experience. Besides the weirdness. Taxi charges to go wait and return. And the prices don't make sense. One day we paid one amount to go to a restaurant and the other it was twice the price for the same distance. And the hotel doesn't help with this matter.  Our city guide took us to nice places in town. He was the only that spoke portuguese my home language. And we trust someone speaking our language. And that was not the best deal. I wanted to buy herbs and trusted him to ask some help. We went to a shop where saffron was 10 dolars each gram. A normal trickster market shop. I found the same safron 10 times cheaper in other shops.  Actually Marrakech ia not a friendly place for tourists and I didn't feel any help from the hotel regarding this subject. But considering everything inside that wonderful palace this is the best experience imaginable.,Date of stay: January 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sao Paulo, SP",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RenatoVTR

You are forced to leave any bottle of water you may have brought with you in your bag at security by the main gate when checking in. I wonder why?!!  This is a blatant way to rip off people attending for the Spa or lunch as day guests. Surely they can’t expect their overnight guests not to be able to carry a bottle of water in and out in a hot country?

La Mamounia Marrakech,MariannaToronto wrote a review Nov 2017,50,Stunning and Exquisiste,We spent six glorious days and nights at La Mamounia to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. The hotel is absolutely stunning with room upon room to discover. The lobby is vibrant and peaceful at the same time and you can disappear into lots of quiet areas both indoors and outside. The gardens are spectacular— far more beautiful than even the Majorelle gardens which we visited. The grounds also feature tennis courts orchards vegetable gardens olive trees— we spent several evenings just wandering the candlelit paths. Staff at the hotel was always friendly helpful and a delight to deal with. Our arrival was flawless from transfer from the airport in the hotel's vintage Jaguar to sipping a cocktail while they checked us in. The rooms are like jewels— every detail has been considered: Exquisite tile work and lighting every where you look. We ate in every restaurant during our stay— five including the bar and every meal we had was memorable.Our favorite was the Moroccan restaurant which features a live band and a belly dancer on occasion. The Spa is gorgeous and the treatments were top notch. La Mamounia is close to everything you would want to see in Marrakesh— walking distance to the Square the souks and most of the sights. The hotel also arranged a wonderful guide for our first afternoon who took us on a guided tour through the old city.

We had to call 6 out of 7 days to get bottled water replaced. The majority of the time the concierge desk was very helpful. There was just one concierge who gave incorrect information. He told us it was not possible to get advance tickets to the YSL museum then let us go there on the only day of the week it was closed. (Another concierge got us advance tickets and we went to the museum the next day.) He also offered a English newspaper which we accepted daily without telling us there was a $10.00 charge per day. The accomodations were beautiful but the carpet in the small sitting room was badly stained. Though the shower is pretty to look at it is impossible to use without flooding part of the bathroom. We were entitled to complimentary WIFI however it didn’t work in the main living room.  After we paid our bill we went back to the suite to relax for a couple of hours before our flight. We had the “Do Not Disturb” sign on but someone kept ringing the bell and knocking. The cashier at reception sent someone to the room to collect cash for that day’s newspaper which they had not put on the bill.

La Mamounia Marrakech,gourmetwashington wrote a review Oct 2017,50,Fabulous Exotic Hotel in Marrakech,This is a beautiful property with exotic rooms and in a perfect location in Marrakech. We had dinner at the Moroccan restaurant -Le Marocain and it was superb with a beautiful setting and music. The breakfast was excellent - serene around the pool. Our laundry came back with the slight scent of orange blossom. The spa service - Hammam was a true experience. Something worth trying - make sure to go for the one hour private treatment with massage. Our room was comfortable and quiet. Also the gardens are gorgeous to walk around.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Seattle, Washington",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gourmetwashington
La Mamounia Marrakech,Jill H wrote a review Oct 2017,50,Completely and totally DROP DEAD,You can hear about it you can dream about it you can even see pictures in magazines or online about it. But the bottom line is Folks this is the only game in town in Marrakech--- I don't cafe what else you read about the competition (whose names I cannot write or TripAdvisor won't publish this!)... it's right up there with The Oriental in Bangkok the George V in Paris or the Peninsula in NY there are not many hotels worldwide that are in this club. So how much did I love being there???? HUGELY!!! In part because Marrakech (and I really have to whisper this one) which was deemed to be the pinnacle of all locales on my tour was a significant disappointment. I didn't like it AT ALL. Until that is that I I walked into La Mamounia and basked in its magnificent quietude. Its lush serenity. Its fabulous gift shhops!! Its myriad places to lounge and have a coffee or a drink. I so admire whoever the decor team was (appparently it was closed for 3 years and they spent $140 million on renovations-- and it shows it the most elegant of ways). The restaurant was beyond fabulous. Have I run out of superlatives yet???,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,North Carolina,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jillhU7813KU
La Mamounia Marrakech,Jemma B wrote a review Oct 2017,40,Great but...,We didn't really know much about Marrakech at all before we got here. After the first day of the hustle and bustle we wanted to relax. We decided to go to La Mamounia and have a bite to eat. The gardens are gorgeous and you really feel it is a luxurious expensive place. While we were eating it was very quiet except for the employees who were making a fuss and arguing by the sounds of it! I'm not sure.. maybe we were sat next to where it was all happening.. or maybe they were having a bad day! We were offered other people's food we hadn't ordered- no smiles from the waitresses- you could just tell they were stressed and not happy. It was written all over there faces and I did leave remembering that the most (and the cute turtles we found on our walk!) We had a club sandwich.. It was very expensive for a bit of toast and avocado. Nothing special or extra.

La Mamounia Marrakech,JDTRAVELBrighton wrote a review Oct 2017,50,Luxury in a perfect setting,This iconic hotel has a perfect location in that it has lovely tranquil gardens and quite places to relax but is only a short walk from the excitement and drama that is Marrakesh. The hotel is beautifully appointed and has a typically Moroccan feel from the bedrooms to all the main rooms including the spa. The hotel pool is large and lovely and situated near some of the restaurants and close to the extensive gardens. The service is attentive and discrete and the buffet breakfast has a good mixture of European and Moroccan delicacies and you can sit by the pool relaxing.  This hotel lives up to its image and delivers on every level service tradition and modern luxury. The bedroom have balconies and you have a choice of view the garden view is the most peaceful except of course for the call to prayer.  Would highly recommend this hotel for someone who wants a truly relaxing luxurious experience but still be close to the heart of Marrakesh.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Brighton,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JDTRAVELBrighton

Excellent breakfast every morning and a lovely pool to relax by during the day. We really enjoyed sitting on the terrace late afternoon with a glass of wine.    Downside for me is the darkness everywhere. I understand the decor I get the look they are going for but I also like to be able to see to put my make up on and to put contact lenses in. The rooms are just too dark. The entire hotel is just too dark. I spent 4 days squinting trying to focus.    Lovely other than that.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Robert T wrote a review Oct 2017,50,Old World Ellegance,We wanted to stay at a top hotel in Marrakech and there are a variety of large well known and small but excellent boutique options to choose from. La Mamounia was the tried and true safe choice. Winston Churchill stayed here and with the full renovation three years ago the experience is just as satisfying as he must have experienced. We did have a minor issue with getting our bags up to our room but after that everything went almost perfectly. We booked a suite but got upgraded. 1 1/2 baths sitting area with second TV and large private terrace made the room top notch. Carved cedar ceiling and carved plaster wall details double sinks and many more such elegant details added to the luxury experience. The breakfast buffet had almost everything you could ask for. French pastries were almost perfect (I have had better on rare occasion). The grounds bars spa and restaurants are excellent although the Winston Churchill bar is just a bit kitschy. A few minor caveats. Lighting in the room is difficult to manage and in the bathroom is not sufficient for women's makeup. The shower has a rain head and hand held and no shower curtain so a shower may soak the bathroom floor a bit and can be logistically problematic if you don't want to use the rain head because it will soak your hair. Yes there is a shower cap but I don't like rain heads or shower caps. Towels are a bit scratchy. The bed is a bit firm but admittedly very comfortable overall. Temperature control in the room does works perfectly and remote controlled window blackout shutters allow you to keep the room dark after sunrise so the sleeping experience is excellent. All in all very little to complain about and the comprehensive experience is excellent. We would have no problem with recommending this hotel to almost anyone.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roberttA5278VX

The hotel is stunning the rooms luxurious and comfortable. They have a great Spa Hamman and Sauna where we got one of the best massages I have ever had. There is also an indoor heated pool at the Spa. The outside pool is also heated and opens until 9:00 pm  The gardens are the ""centerpiece"" of the hotel as this was a wedding gift from the King to his son Prince Al Mamoun in the 12th Century. Full of fruit trees and flowers I felt at peace and relaxed and enjoyed the serene beauty of the gardens.  The hotel has 4 restaurants The Moroccan The French The Italian Restaurants and The Pool Pavilion where Breakfast and Brunch are served as well as a lunch buffet. I can't pick a favorite. This hotel was frequented by Sir Winston Churchill and their most unique bar is named after him.  However I must say as spectacularly beautiful as the hotel is the best part of the experience is the service. We experienced impeccable service from the moment we walked in. From the receptionist the massage therapists and their fine restaurants. The personnel is eager to please and pamper you.

I never exprected that comment from a server especially in such an expensive hotel  Really dissapointed indeed.

Tried Italian restaurant but were very disappointed and café also did not offer parituclarly good food. A cup of tea or coffee was priced at £7 and a ceasar salad £30! so not cheap for average food.    Rooms lovely but need to have a garden view.    Also check your bills when leaving hotel tried to charge us a 60 dirham surcharge for breakfast even though we had it included. Breakfast display was very mediocre indeed we have seen much better displays at nearly every other hotel we have stayed and the cost is approx. £40 per person.

The pool and surrounding gardens are sublime as is the champagne served by the pool! The staff are both professional and welcoming and go above and beyond to ensure all needs are met. Particular accolades should be sent to the Director of the spa who provided the most stylish and 'perfect' haircut and to the staff of both Le Marocain and L'Italien restaurants who provided superb service and divine food (and although closed this year Le Francais).

Starting at the front desk great welcoming by the team we were asking to seat in one of the lounge to proceed the check-in. Camel milk and dates to install you in the atmosphere; however no one found our booking not understandable especially after receiving 3 days before a pre-check-in email... It seems they could not believe us that we had a booking so we had to send them the confirmation.    Once they found out my booking with the 3rd part (LHW) they invited us to wait our room by the pool a timing of 2.45pm given...at 3 pm I asked the pool boy to call the reception if the room was ready but none of them came back to us. At 3.15 I had to check myself at the reception as the pool boys were not helpful at all. In the same time a front desk manager came to see us...the room was ready!    Once in the room we recognised the ""Jacques Garcia"" style (which I love) however a little bit dated and really dark. There were no amenities in the room (water) the only thing present was glass coasters from previous guest. I called the room service for asking them but nothing came (as a LHW member we suppose to have some amenities).    As we were really disappointed about the service we dined somewhere else. We also had our breakfast here...one of the best we ever had a wide choice of all the best things well done!    To summarise this stay a 5 star is nothing without a great service each interaction with team members seemed they were asking for tips...sorry but a tip is given only when the staff deserves it...not on this stay. That is a huge disappointment for me as I was really waiting for this stay.

We arrived at the hotel only to be told our room wasn't ready at 1pm was made to wait until after lunch before we could get to our room. Despite staying in a suite there were no special honeymoon arrangements made in our suite or during our stay. Many times we were stopped around the hotel by security presumably we looked asian. There is no kettle in the suite and we had to order room service for tea or coffee which always took more than half an hour to arrive. Our guest came over to the hotel for a visit and was refused entry to our suite. On top of that I wrote a letter to the General Manager regarding our stay which he never replied. I've been waiting for his reply for the past 6 months. All in all La Mamounia is a beautiful hotel with lush gardens. A visit is a must while in Marrakech. But not worth the stay. For that go to Royal Mansour. A total opposite experience.,Date of stay: January 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adamazlan

La Mamounia Marrakech,PigletWinnieAndRoo wrote a review Jul 2017,40,Italian Bar -,We went for a drink. Some of the bars were closed so The Italian bar was the one we went into. It's in two parts - inside and outside. We opted to go outside where the temperature was still around 38C (it had been 46C in the Souk). Service was not quick but provided you knew what you wanted and asked for the bill when the drinks arrived it was acceptable.    Very comfortable and would have been even more comfortable in the very well air conditioned section inside!    You can ask for a WiFi voucher (free for 4 hours) and send home your pictures from the Souk. £25 for a rum and coke with two soft drinks was inline with my expectations for an International hotel.    There was a violinist playing Lennon and McCartney songs which added to the atmosphere.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Hampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PigletWinnieAndRoo

I cannot understand what anyone had to say negatively about this hotel. The staff was super helpful and accommodating the spa was incredible the pool was beautiful and very relaxing the gardens are amazing and the room was spacious and beautiful with one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in! We did not eat at the main restaurants only at the pool but the food was delicious and there as a good wine selection. The hotel is absolutely stunning - do not miss the gardens! It is located right in the center of town a very short walk to the medina the main mosque and palaces. The area is very safe as well- we walked alone at night to some local restaurants that the concierge recommended and never felt uncomfortable. The staff was welcoming and spoke perfect English.    I can't wait to go back!

La Mamounia Marrakech,Siri S wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Old world palace with stunning renovation,La Mamounia realizes every fantasy one has when picturing themselves in Marrakech. The mosaic tiles clusters of columns the black and white columned courtyard the indoor pool with day bed reflecting the stunning work on the surrounding walls the garden of palms with a lanterned area for cocktails...every detail delights the eye. As the space was originally built as a palace for the king's son Mamoun it retains a regal vibe that is authentic versus some of the newly constructed luxury resorts in the area. The location within the medina makes day excursions painless - most everything was a 5-10 minute car ride away.

La Mamounia Marrakech,DarnIt22 wrote a review Jun 2017,50,Amazing Hotel,Let me start by saying I didn't stay here. My group of friends rented a riad in the medina but we had heard about La Mamounia and wanted to go to the famous Churchill Bar. Unfortunately it was closed during our time there but we did go to the bar/jazz salon area for a drink.  The hotel was amazing inside. There was a courtyard garden as you first entered the property and a beautifully appointed interior of the hotel. I was very glad that I had dressed nicely for dinner beforehand as I would have felt very out of place in anything less than business casual. In fact I probably wouldn't have been allowed in at all had I not been well dressed.  The bar staff was extremely helpful and stopped to chat with us about different places we might go during our stay in Marrakech.  I did manage to get my Churchill fix with a Champagne drink named in his honor.  I don't particularly like to stay at hotels when traveling but if I make it back to Marrakech La Mamounia is going to test my resolve on that.,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Overland Park, Kansas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DarnIt22

Two very smart and polite security guards met us at the entrance and showed us in. The front of the hotel is fabulous and another lovely gentleman greeted us at the door. The bar is stunning the decor is a beautiful dark red and the floors are polished to perfection. We had a bottle of champagne and a cocktail the service was faultless. The staff were dressed immaculately and very pleasant. We then went for a walk around the hotel gardens which were stunning I can honestly say La Mamounia deserves each one of its five stars.

La Mamounia Marrakech,CharlieBR3 wrote a review Jun 2017,50,Luxury Personified,We purchased a day pass to the hotel which for approximately €150 gave us full access to the gym a spa treatment 3 course a la carte lunch and the rest of the day by the pool.    The hotel has recently been refurbished and the opulence and splendour of the establishment can not be overstated enough as my title suggests it was definitely luxury personified!    I would certainly recommend a walk around the gardens they an oasis of colour and fragrances in this climate full of butterflies and exotic birds too.    The food in the restaurant was also exquisite and I believe many ingredients sourced from their gardens. If I had one criticism it was the speed of service in the restaurant. While obviously not in a rush they did manage to prolong it over 2 hours.    This certainly shouldn't detract however from what is the most perfect day out if your budget like mine doesn't extend to actually staying here but you do feel you deserve a treat and wish to be pampered!

Simply Amazing,If you can't stay at this hotel then it is a must to visit simply to experience the design architecture and ambiance of the building and its gardens. Thankfully we were lucky to stay at La Mamounia for 3 nights in an Agdal Suite facing the pool.    The decor and design of the room is amazing its like a small palace. Only photos can do it justice I can't describe it so well. The staff is so polite and attentive it makes you feel extremely pampered. Food options are plenty and very good one Italian restaurant and one Moroccan besides the poolside restaurant open for breakfast and lunch. The Moroccan restaurant was exceptionally good with local musicians playing to set you in the mood. I had a lamb tagine and my wife the chicken tagine both were really good. Also for breakfast forget about coffee try the moroccan tea every day.

So we did. And we're happy we did because hammam wasn't a very relaxing experience. I felt rushed all the time and was only allowed to relax for last 10 minutes or so. Hammam was executed by a harsh lady. She didn't speak English. Not a word. So if you're not satisfied with the way the treatment goes you can't even complain. My partner had the same issue.

La Mamounia Marrakech,SophieK385 wrote a review Jun 2017,30,Different Expectations,We where very looking forward to our stay at the La Mamounia but as experienced travelers we weren't impressed.    1) Room: We did get a double upgrade and the room was nice (not great) - however I was dreading to think how the room we had originally booked would have been (since the price is very high). We did appreciate the daily fresh fruit and the 2 bottles of water in our room.    2) Breakfast: the situation in the breakfast room is not acceptable (see previous reviews on TripAdvisor). Birds where all over the buffet (The did try to cover a few bread baskets with napkins but really? How about investing in some Glas bell jars?).  Literally nothing (except the butter on some days) is lettered so you don't really know what you are taking from the buffet.  The food on the buffet is not presented very appealing (see picture).    3) Food: we didn't eat at the restaurants because the prices are plain rude. I have stayed at the best hotels around the world and I am not willing to pay 380MAD = 35€ for a Caprese with Buffala on the Terrace.  We did have lunch once at the pool and the food was not great considering that it was highly overpriced.    4) Pool: the Pool is really nice and I would always book a hotel with a big pool in Marrakech. Service at the pool is rather slow and you always have to ask for the menu. I am not a great fan of the day tourists that can use the pool and loungers for a fairly small price - I think it's unfair for all the guests in the house that pay a hefty price for their stay.    5) Gym: there are 2 gyms (a small one in the spa & a larger one in a separate building). Unfortunately the opening hours are limited (closing at 8 pm). One time my husband 1/2 an hour before closing leaving the impression that the staff wanted to go home. The equipment however is very good and modern.    The Hotel itself is very nice but considering the price and what you get for it we will stay somewhere else next time.,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Munich, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SophieK385

La Mamounia Marrakech,29explorer wrote a review May 2017,50,Simply Stunning,We stay here May 22-25 2017 for 3 nights and loved every second of it. Usually when you arrive at Menara Airport it could take couple hours in lines to clear customs. We got fast track service from La Mamounia which zipped us right through customs without any line up. It cost you 600MAD pp. I do recommend using their pickup service for arrival; cost is 600 MAD as well and they use either a Land Rover or Jaguar for pick up.  We booked a palace suite and were upgraded to an Executive suite which was really kind of the management. Also we arrived around 10:30 and the suite was ready which was quite impressive. There are no line ups for check in you are asked to be seated in their lounge and a rep comes to you to collect your documentations and provide you with the room keys. You are greeted with juice and dates. The rep walks you to your suite/ room and show you around. A very nice touch to a beautiful beginning.  We had breakfast each morning at the hotel buffet 950 MAD for two. They buffet use to close at 10:30am and what I found was some dishes were not being re filled after 10:15 while they were still talking guest for breakfast.  The suite was opulent and we just loved it. The architecture alone in the room was breath taking. They brought complimentary water and fruits daily. They even offered flips flops and indoor slippers.  The hotel concierge booked a tour guide for us for all three days. Now you can take their land rover or take a nice taxi from outside with AC and pay quarter of the price. So we took the outside taxi. Mr. Najib Kajjab was our guide for two days and he was just amazing. Typically guides try to take you to certain stores where they get a cut or try to favor their friends it was nothing like this. Mr. Najib has been working for the hotel for last 20 some years and is very professional. He is very knowledgeable and because if him we explored so much more than what we could have done our selves. He even helped us to bargain with the shopkeepers. It was simply a pleasure having him our guide. He would meet us in the hotel prior to heading out and we would discuss where we would like to go and see. An example of his professionalism our private tour was supposed to be at 10:30 and we came down around 11:00 as I did not want to rush breakfast and his response was “ not a problem at all you are on vacation take your time and whenever you are ready we can start do not rush”. I thought that was really nice of him. I strongly recommend getting a tour guide from the hotel as they are very professional and informative and very reasonably price. A half day private tour guide cost 250 MAD and full day is 500 MAD and you can completely customize where you want to go and see. If you want a local experience there are a lot of nice restaurants in the Medina with roof top terrace with amazing views. Ask your tour guide as they are the experts.  Places we ate:  Azar(Lebanese) for dinner  very good and it was a house full. La Sultana for lunch beautiful place and terrace but very slow and limited options. Naranj (Labanese) for lunch in medina amazing food loved. it. Al-Fassis for dinner very lovely outdoor dinning. Lastly Teresse de epices roof top terrace in Medina for dinner house full and mouth-watering dishes. It is highly recommended to make reservations for dinner as most of the restaurants get full every night.  The hotel got an enormous pool and acres of garden. It is a perfect place for morning and evening stroll. Overall I would say it was a pleasure staying at this property. Special thanks to Mr. Najib and the conceriage team that were very helpful and took great care of us.

La Mamounia Marrakech,coppet1 wrote a review May 2017,30,Beautiful property. Service not on par with price.,It's probably the most beautiful property in Marrakech with stunning gardens pool and spa. Rates are extremely expensive. For a superior room (no thrills) we paid 700 Euro per night. The room was small and in the morning we were greeted with a sewage smell coming out of the AC. We were very disappointed by the way the front desk dealt with the issue. They did not really take our complain seriously said sorry and the next morning there was the smell again - whiteout checking with us or asking if things have improved. For the room price we paid we would have expected at least some sort of compensation be it only symbolic with a drink a cookie being sent to the room or whatsoever.    But no effort was made.    It reflected however the general attitude of the front desk somehow which could be described as little helpful and at times even as a bit snooty.    At an other occasion we asked the concierge for a zip lock bag to pack some liquids that we wanted to transport in our luggage. Before I even finished my question he already affirmed that they do not have any zip lock nor plastic bags. After I insisted he called someone in the hotel to check and yes: i got my zip lock bags.    In contrast to that the staff at the hotel restaurants and at the spa was very friendly and helpful.    I would recommend not to stay at this overpriced yet beautiful property and choose an alternative with better service - such as the (however even more expensive Royal Mansour) or a cheaper place such as the El Fynn Riad.    If you would like to enjoy the stunning Mamounia property without staying there you can still go and visit the gardens or the restaurants as an external guest.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Zurich, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coppet1

The place is overhyped on social medias and is a disappointment in reality. Service is poor no attention to detail and too much attitude and arrogance from staff. The food was average and did not provide vegetarian options for the amuse bouche.

La Mamounia Marrakech,charlotte3125 wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Timeless Beauty,Having travelled to many places around the world I can say without a doubt that La Mamounia was one of the best hotels I have ever been to. It is spectacular. Although it is on the larger end it has a classic charm to it that reminds me of the 1910s. (But don't worry the rooms and the hotel itself have the amenities and cleanliness of the 21st century.) I could go on and on about how perfect this hotel was; however after reflecting back on it I would have to say that the gardens were the highlight of this hotel. They are absolutely breathtaking. I have never seen anything like them before. Everything about this hotel was extraordinary and I would return in a heartbeat if I could.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Peter H wrote a review Apr 2017,50,A world of beauty and sensual pleasures in an exotic land. This hotel is spectacular.,I visited for a friends 40th and was blown away by the grand beauty of this extraordinary hotel. The grounds are sprawling with gardens exploding with roses. There are fruit trees to grow fresh produce and gardens to grow the produce for the restaurant. There are stunning pools inside and out. A first rate Ha-mam and Spa. Upon arrival you are greeted with rosewater milk and biscuits then given a tour of the spectacular facilities. On every surface you see beauty. Hand-carved cedar walls hand painted ceilings marble covered walls stunning Moroccan fixtures and glorious artwork meet your every glance. There is almost too much beauty for your eye to behold. The staff is gracious helpful and discreet. The service impeccable. I was blown away by the spectacular place. I never missed on of the bountiful breakfasts on offer included in your rate. It was always a great way to start the day. I have stayed in a lot of nice hotels over the years but La Momounia is right up there at the top of the list of my best stays ever anywhere in the world. It's truly an incredible experience. I have a single and very minor note of possible improvement: the coffee served at breakfast was a bit weak for my taste. Order a cappuccino and you will be in heaven.

We arrived at 230 am and both our rooms got upgraded right away.We ultimately had to take a third room since we were unable to fit my nephew who had decided to travel with us last minute.Just from the mini hermes  ish key case you knew things were going to be first class all the way.The suite was a mini palace in itself with arch shaped doors and windows and lavish furnishings and woodwork.The large bathroom was all very luxe with a free standing tub and marble walls and floorsThe toilet was in a separate area with a bidet...whats with the doorless showers???We had a very hard time figuring out the lights and struggled for quite sometime until we were able to get the lights closed.  We ordered room service since we hadn't eaten since lunch the day before and it was delicious.They even fried us fish!  What a view from our gorgeous balcony of the garden!  Breakfast by the pool was absolutely lovely and fresh.  After a long day of touring and shopping we came back to swim and use the hamam and spa which was absolutely magnificent!  Even the lockers were hermes orange leather.  After a night out on the town we returned for a short sleep and woke early to enjoy the breakfast and pool one last time before our long journey home to new york...  When our sprinter failed to arrive the hotel chauffeured us to the airport in their personal burgundy jaguars and range rover and chaperoned us all the way till we reached the gate!!!They even filled out the forms for customs for all of us!!!It was the icing on the cake!!!We really felt like royalty!,Date of stay: April 2017,,"Brooklyn, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Margibijou

La Mamounia Marrakech,Candice H wrote a review Apr 2017,40,Beautiful hotel but very dark and odd service at times,The hotel is stunning although inside is very dark. We recently stayed and outside it is sunny and bright and beautiful and you are practically in the pitch black dark once you enter the hotel. The main entrance/seating area is very dark and gloomy. Our bathroom was also very dark there was very little lighting.    There are a few factors which are not up to 5* hotel standards:  Once we arrived we were told to pay upfront and as we were a group of 3 we had to spend time dividing and separating the credit cards which was quite inconvenient and tiring considering we had just landed and were tired and in our travel clothes.    I didn't find the concierge/reception staff helpful and the overall service by the pool and around the hotel is slow. Apart from that the location is great the food was generally very good and it is a very picturesque hotel especially the gardens    The hotel boutiques are very overpriced and the lady working in the La Mamounia boutique was very rude and unfriendly/unhelpful,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Naples, Italy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/8candiceh

La Mamounia Marrakech,AnnaKMorris wrote a review Apr 2017,20,"Don't waste your time, unless to tour the gardens and have a glass of wine....",I wouldn’t waste my time or money. We came here to celebrate my husband’s birthday with the intention of buying a day pass to the pool and having a lovely lunch to relax tan and swim. I’m unsure of when they stopped selling day passes but they weren’t allowed when we went this week. We were told the pool was only for the guests…a little disappointing but no problem lunch instead!    We wanted to eat poolside and the only offering was a buffet for 150 euros per person…SERIOUSLY?! We are traveling the world for 10 months and are far from poor but that is a crazy amount of money to spend on brunch on a Monday? I’ve honestly never heard of such a thing.    We passed and went to the bar/snack area….where burgers were approximately 25 euro and that was the cheapest thing on the menu. We didn’t think worth it at all and instead settled for two glasses of wine and planned to change our day and get out of La Mamounia.    One big plus however is that the staff couldn’t have been nicer. That was a nice treat and of course the grounds are gorgeous. But I don’t know why you’d want to come here and pay a huge amount of money for a place that doesn’t even feel like Marrakech?! You’d be better off getting out of the medina area and heading where we went for a perfect afternoon instead…Beldi Country Club. Our only regret was that we didn’t get there sooner.    All of that being said…the gardens are quite lovely and worth a stroll through. Just don’t plan on having lunch or going to the pool. My rose wine was 19 euro and worth it considering it’s hard to find wine in Marrakech….much less a good French rose. I hate writing bad reviews but felt inclined to share so that you can design your day better than we did.    A glass of wine and walk through the gardens are a perfect way to spend time at La Mamounia.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnaKMorris

La Mamounia Marrakech,SMc7 wrote a review Apr 2017,20,"Grand hotel, if they let you in...",The first thing to say is that if you are not staying at this hotel the entrance staff try to make your life as difficult as possible. Please take note- as other reviewers have pointed out men are not allowed to wear flip flops and you will be turned away rudely. Also I believe men have to wear trousers after 5pm. So this is not a place to pop in to for a drink after wandering around the medina. Having been turned away once probably against my better judgement I returned a few days later suitably attired for a late afternoon drink as I had been told by my charming riad owner that the gardens are worth seeing. This time I had a backpack containing my iPad and laptop. The security guy on the street wanted me to leave it with him not secured in any way. Why I'm not sure (they have a metal detector which doesn't work by the way). I refused. Twice. And then he grudgingly let me in. The hotel is very grand the gardens lovely and the staff inside are very nice. But this really leaves a bad taste in the mouth and management need to understand that either they don't allow non-residents- fair enough if that's the policy you want to follow- or treat guests nicely as like me they might have been future residents. But not after that treatment... stay like I did at Riad Coccon instead.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Bagshot, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMc7

La Mamounia Marrakech,1000Heidi1000 wrote a review Apr 2017,20,"If you are looking for arrogance, pomposity and over pricing, this is the place to visit.",My friends and I were staying at the Kasbah Tamadot an hour out of town and decided to have lunch at La Mamounia. The gardens where we chose to have lunch were very pleasant but that was where the pleasantries ended. We ordered three glasses of rosé a bottle of water and two club sandwiches. Service was slow and when the sandwiches arrived instead of having the expected four quarters per sandwich there were only three. The waiter dropped one of the sandwiches and was visibly upset although we were absolutely fine and an accident is an accident. The second sandwich arrived ten minutes or so later. The bill for lunch for the three of us was just short of £100.    Whilst the bill for lunch was hefty it's what we would expect for a five star city hotel. However we didn't expect what happened next when we looked for the washrooms. There was a film crew working just off the main corridor and as we walked towards the main reception area we were told in an off hand manner to BE QUIET. The crew were shooting near the ladies bathroom so after several minutes of waiting to use the ladies washroom we were literally pushed into a men's bathroom by a crew member. No one checked if there were any men in there and it was all rather humiliating having to walk past urinals into the lavatories.    Before I left I quietly asked to see the GM. He came to reception and was clearly disinterested in either our lunch experience or the shambles that ensued. A half hearted reassurance that everything would be fine on our next visit did little to persuade me that I should ever return to this place.    I would say that this is somewhere that trades on a faded reputation and based on our brief lunch experience it is not somewhere that I'd wish to stay at or return to.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Knutsford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1000Heidi1000

La Mamounia Marrakech,WoWie1010 wrote a review Apr 2017,30,Fading beauty ....,This was our third stay at the grande old Dame of Morocco.    The property is still marvellous: The design of the hotel the rooms the spa the restaurants - stunning and simply beautiful Jacques Garcia at his best. The gardens are lush the food at any of the four Restaurants (Italian French Moroccan garden pavillion) decent. However this time around unfortunately (I was prepared to enjoy my stay as much as the previous ones!) I have a variety of complaints.    First the room. We booked a normal category and the room was the size of a shoe box. Just to give an idea - the room was so small that we could open our suitcase only when we put it on the bed. The toilet was so tiny that we could not close the door (me knee would have been pressed against the door) and that I hurt my head when standing up. The room was ground floor and the window (no balcony) went into a small court yard which was humming with the sound of air conditioners. Simply depressing and not acceptable for a hefty EUR 1.000 per night. At least I have to say that we could change rooms after the first night although the upgrade was not complimentary.    Second while everything looks splendid on first sight the hotel is bit run down. Wifi? - very slow throughout the hotel and not working at all in both our rooms. Sockets? - half of them not working. TV function on treadmills in the gym? - not working. Lighting? - not all of it working (e.g. in our wardroobe) rooms should be checked more thoroughly. Electrical appliances? - completely outdated. All of this should not happen in such a hotel and it really impaired the quality of our stay (I ended up having to work in the lobby because I needed Wifi and not using the gym).    Service is generally good but not always up to the standard. We were particularly annoyed by the fact that although we had pre-booked hammam and massage it was not possible to find a convenient time because the Spa was overbooked. I think the hotel should have contacted us beforehand.    All in all - still a good experience but I am not sure it is worth the money. After all there is a Mandarin Oriental and a Four Seasons which could be worth a try next time.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Vienna, Austria",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WoWie1010

La Mamounia Marrakech,Europesally wrote a review Mar 2017,20,Will never stay here again,Stayed here with my husband in August '16. Have stayed in great hotels all over the world and we were really looking forward to am amazing few days on our own. How disappointed were we.  1. Churchhill bar was closed  2. The French Michelin restaurant was closed  3. the breakfast area was in a tiny room. Most uninspiring brown carpeted awfully ugly room.  4 there were swarms of wasps outside and they were all over the inside of the breakfast area  5. The fruit bowls were FULL of flies. I know this is going to sound like this cd not be true. But it is. Further all the waitresses and waiters laughed as the few guests tried to come to terms with even contemplating eating the fruit. None of us did. Ordered eggs Benedict. They were unavailable. The service from staff was appalling. They seemed to laugh at guests as this temporary breakfast area was just appalling and they knew that.    What's worse in my view is we were paying obvious high price to stay here and the vast majority of people at the pool were renting pool lounger for the day. This makes the exclusivity of Mamounia a joke.    I've never stayed in a hotel where people can pay 50 euro to use all the facilities for the day when we were paying 700e per night to stay there.    The Italian rest was nice but nothing at all special.    The guys at the bar were very nice and professional.    The bedroom was tiny and i know we'd booked an upgraded room - can't recall the name of it now.    It was so bad I felt I had to bring all of this to the attention of the Manager. He listened but I cd see because I was female he really didn't respect my comments. It was only when my husband confirmed he apologised.    This was once upon a time a very opulent and luxurious hotel. It's very easy to see that. The event throughout the hotel is sublime. But it really needs to move with the times and up it's standard. It's too reliant on its name. They could not be making much profit if they've to resort to renting sun loungers.    It feels empty inside. You can see the luxury (don't get me wrong) but when we were there I think there was max 20 people at breakfast and dinner each day. I cd not believe it.    I thought one would see high style everywhere but I suspect the real rich have found the other many beautiful places in Marrakech.    The Royal Mansour being one or for families with the slightly less luxury but far more wonderful things the Pullman ticks all the boxes.    We were extremely disappointed and were hopeful this hotel cd provide a long weekend break away on our own for many years for some. Sadly I wouldn't return.,Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Europe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Europesally
La Mamounia Marrakech,rokko193 wrote a review Mar 2017,50,Prepare to be Amazed,Spectacular hotel perfect service. The decor is characteristic Moroccan which some might find a bit over the top if it weren't done so well. Possibly the finest breakfast buffet possible served next to the massive outdoor pool. The extensive gardens have surprises around each corner.    As I read other TA reviews I see some complaints about how expensive the hotel and drinks are. Yes this is an expensive property. What can one say? There are many alternative hotels to fit budget travelers. If that is what you are looking for it's not La Mamounia. (Although some coiffure services at the spa were reportedly very reasonable.)    One other review said that it was cold eating breakfast outdoors.

We were shown to a table away from the restaurant... got the feeling we were not allowed near the area where hotel guests sit... Awkward. Two coffees: 140 Dirham...  At the spa they could not find our 12:00 spa treatment reservation... we were told they could help us at 15:00... We opted to cancel. Only then the spa manager came running.

La Mamounia Marrakech,colprubin wrote a review Mar 2017,30,Like Staying at your Stingy Rich Uncle's House,There's a lot of hype about this hotel that combined with the price tag made me expect that staying here would be one of the great hotel experiences of my life. I have to say I was disappointed. Yes the facilities and gardens are beautiful. What ruined it for me was an overall stinginess. Consider the refreshments at the hotel: $19 for a glass of wine and $7 for a soft drink or coffee. Even worse was an almost complete absence of freebies for guests. After shelling out so much for my room I was hoping for a nice bedtime chocolate or plate of cookies. When we asked for a coffee machine in the room de riguer within many fine hotels they wanted to charge us $7 for each nespresso capsule!. I really felt like I was being fleeced by my stingy rich uncle.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Carmen C wrote a review Mar 2017,50,Absolutely an oasis close to the Medina. Luxury hotel.,Fantastic stay and very warm welcome. We stayed in the Agdal Suite with a view to the pool and gardens absolutely stunning. The service is impeccable. It is a very luxurious and comfortable hotel and they really make you feel at home. Breakfast is delicious however the only thing I would say is that nearby the pool and outside even though it is very nice sometimes it is too sunny or too cold in the morning and it would be nice to have a place inside. Also the food is very good but there could be more variety and better fruits. That would be the only thing i would improve. Overall excellent service and beautiful stay.

It is the quality of the service and the beauty of the palace that make it so special. They make you feel at home. I really recommend to stay in the Agdal Suite it is a very authentic morrocan luxury experience. The food of the restautants is very good and breakfast food is good too. The only negative point I would mention is the breakfast buffet... It is set outside and there is no option for inside and sometimes it is a bit chilly in the morning. The food is awesome however compared to other luxury hotels I think there could be more food variation/options. Overall it has been an absolutely excellent stay and I have really loved La Mamounia and totally recommend this unique experience to anyone visiting Marrakech.,,,"Madrid, Comunidad de Madrid, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ccaballero01
La Mamounia Marrakech,JLloydLondon wrote a review Mar 2017,50,"Sumptuous luxury, an oasis of calm, effortlessly so",After a couple of hectic days in Marrakech I decided it was time to pay a visit to the famous La Mamounia hotel just to see if it matched the description in the guide book.    As a result I learnt something very valuable - don't always believe the guide book!    On the day I visited I was wearing a polo shirt and shorts - but the guide book said such attire was banned and you'd need to be dressed smartly to get in.    Chancing my arm I was graciously waved in at the outer gates matched by a similar greeting at the hotel doors allowing me to wander through the stunning lobby area out to the gorgeous ground floor terrace.    Taking a seat observing more glamorously dressed guests lounging on the sofas and chairs I was swiftly offered a menu and made to feel comfortably at ease.    Given the warmth of the welcome I was more than happy to splash out selecting a £15 vodka martini and easing back into the opulent ambience as if to the manor born.    Thoughts turned to Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt seated here some 70 years ago considering the big issues that faced them soothed by the balmy weather and the effortless quality exuding from every aspect of this location.    After savouring my drink and the olives I wandered the gardens for a while before making use of the facilities on my way out. Did Winnie use the same one I wondered?    By far the classiest spot you can find in Marrakech.

An 'old world' property with a fascinating history that upholds a superior level of service throughout the entire hotel. Rooms are beautifully designed and maintained with all the amenities you could need. Most come with outstanding views across the immaculately kept gardens and Atlas Mountains in the distance all admired from a well-sized balcony equipped with comfortable furniture. The pool area is big but not intrusive and very comfortable. From here you can walk the gardens taking in the incredible landscape and al fresco dining areas - a welcome escape from the hustle & bustle of the souks.  Food is well prepared and very tasty - either just poolside or in one of their fine dining restaurants. Plenty of choice and are very popular among guests and visitors - ensuring there's nearly always a pleasant atmosphere.  Every last detail has been meticulously planned and maintained from the scent throughout the hotel to the room keys the cocktail preparation and garnish next to the 3 piece jazz band to the plethora of candles (which is particularly noticeable when the hotel transforms at night).

It exceeded our expectation on every level with its lush and beautiful grounds gorgeous architecture mosaic tile sculptures pools lanterns furnishings design and history.    It is the people however and their service who truly set this hotel into a whole other strata of hotels. People like Salwa at the front desk and every other employee at the hotel who bent over backwards to accommodate our every need are what truly make it the creme de la creme. The scene of many weddings and honeymoons Hotel La Mamounia is a perfect romantic backdrop with its eight-acre gardens flourishing with desert palms cacti hibiscus and acacia trees beyond which lie the ancient pink walls of medieval Marrakech.

As a young couple we were constantly questioned as guests of the hotel which was something that we thought the staff should know better. The food was subpar a burger costing 32 dollars with a side of bagged steamed vegetables wasn’t close to good. One experience after another was negative from rotting fruit as a welcome to the room a tour guide hired through the hotel not giving us any information and issues with the casino.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Gemma C wrote a review Feb 2017,50,Pure luxury in a beautiful city.,What can I say? This hotel lives up to expectations and I felt very privileged to have the opportunity to stay for a couple of nights. It combines traditional moroccan style with European luxury so it isn't the most authentic place to stay in Marrakech but if you want pure luxury this is definitely the place. I could (and indeed did) spend hours just walking round taking photos hanging by the pool and in the spa and enjoying the immaculate gardens. The communal spaces are truly gorgeous.    As for my room it was well-appointed with a huge wardrobe area a stunning moroccan-tiled bathroom with a walk-in shower and roll-top bath and a huge comfy bed and roomy living area. I couldn't fault it.    Staff were incredibly attentive and overall very friendly. There was a slight feeling of 'are you supposed to be here maam?' a couple of times but let's be honest given that I wasn't a glossy-haired perfectly tanned model type dripping in designer labels I didn't exactly represent the average hotel guest and I wasn't questioned after saying I was a guest.    The only downside of staying here is that this luxury comes at a price and I'm not just talking about the room itself. Drinks and food were exceedingly pricey but you do get what you pay for. Breakfast was lovely the lunch buffet served by the pool was so good I wanted a second stomach to be able to go back for more and the meal I enjoyed at the Italian restaurant was delicious.

The staff I feel for them because they are under a lot of pressure to please and get it right every time I feel that management should provide adequate training that can help them provide solutions when they don't have the right answer and can't find a higher up to solve sticky situations. It's such a busy place gosh I was a bit bothered by that perhaps the marketing folks should talk to the customer service folks to determine whether they can meet the 5 star clientele expectations every time.

La Mamounia Marrakech,juliarblank wrote a review Jan 2017,40,A bit of warning!,As an avid traveler I wanted to share my honest opinion about this hotel. I have given it 4 stars because of a few important factors that were below average.  1. Stay away from Hammam experience it's pretty terrible. Overpriced weird unwelcoming.  For $150++ you get a quick scrub and a quick wash off. Then escorted to get changed back into your clothes and shown the door out.  I have made a complaint to the spa and general management but refund was frowned upon and my complaint went swept under a rug. The manager did however offer a complementary massage which I politely refused after such disappointing experience.  The food was fabulous during breakfast but average at most at the bar.  The service at the bar was slow and inattentive too. Lots of people working but little gets done.  Everything else at the hotel was great. We particularly enjoyed tennis and gym facilities .

La Mamounia Marrakech,James A wrote a review Jan 2017,40,Amazing facilities but drawbacks detract,First of all the major positive: La Mamounia is one of the great hotel facilities in the world--an utterly amazing esthetic treat. I did not say one of the great hotels in the world because a hotel is much more than its mere physical plant. The hotel service is somewhat spotty; the employees are nice and I believe trustworthy just not very reliable or efficient. The guests are also unlike any of the other hotels we stayed at in Morocco (i.e. the Four Seasons in Casablanca the Villa Diyafa in Rabat and the Raid Laaroussa in Fez). In those other hotels the other guests--who generally weren't American which was fine with us--were pleasant and nice to be around. At La Mamounia there were hordes of bored rich narcissistic-looking Francophones. Dwelling on the positive I average down the facilities (Excellent) for the service and guests (decidedly below average) and attempting to dwell on the positive end up with a Very Good rating (about which I'm somewhat ambivalent). Who knows? Perhaps some readers of this review would view the omnipresence of Euro-trash as a decided positive.

The carved doors ceilings and walls were beautiful. We wanted a busier hotel with the Moroccan charm. It is on the expensive side but was worth every penny.

La Mamounia Marrakech,CarolCha wrote a review Jan 2017,50,Perfect stay,My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at La Mamounia. This place used to be a palace in the past and to this day it still has the style the luxury and the majesty of a palace that it once was.  The hotel is very beautiful. The gardens and all the facilities are spectacular.  There are three restaurants in the hotel and if I could point out something to be improved I would say that the restaurants are very pricey compared to what they have to offer. With so many options of great restaurants in Marrakesh at much better prices I would not especially recommend one of the restaurants at La Mamounia.  Besides that no wonder why so many celebrities stayed there. We even got to see the king and the princess of Morocco at the hotel.,Date of stay: January 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sao Paulo, SP",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolCha

La Mamounia Marrakech,Meg18442 wrote a review Jan 2017,40,Overpriced restaurants,This is one of the most beautiful hotels in the world but it is certainly not the best. In the Imperial Delhi the Taj in Mumbai and other Five star hotels the food is a delight. Here the chef seems to have stayed in a time warp. The Christmas Eve dinner cost 1600 dirham ( £135 per person. ) The food was below standard for a hotel of that quality. The duck pate was under seasoned and we left our main course. The chicken was served with flabby white skin still on it. We complained but nothing was taken off our bill.  There was no choice of dessert and my husband does not like chocolate.  As a result we did not eat there again during our week's stay. We had wonderful food in the city however in tiny riads and inexpensive restaurants  Tom Kitchin needs to take a visit there and teach the chef how to prepare food to an exceptionally high standard if they expect clients to pay exceptionally high prices. We would never go back despite the fact that we had a superb room and lived the staff and the wonderful service. I feel that the hotel is wonderful but the food far less so.,Date of stay: December 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Edinburgh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meg18442
La Mamounia Marrakech,macchadiary wrote a review Jan 2017,40,Beautiful and Overpriced,La Mamounia is a beautiful hotel. However like some other reviewers I feel like it is overhyped and overpriced. I wouldn't say 5 stars. I have stayed at some better hotels. Service was mediocre. If you want to visit La Mamounia I would recommend a visit and/or eat at the restaurant if you want more of an experience. I think it is way too overpriced for what they have to offer. There wasn't much to see in the garden either.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Nadia H wrote a review Dec 2016,40,"Beautiful hotel, but overpriced and possibly overhyped",Mamounia is a beautiful hotel with amazing premises both in-house and with a stunning park that makes walking a joy. The pool is actually just average in my view some 5 star hotels in Marrakech have more to offer. The rooms are beautiful and well attended to with care to detail. We were less happy about the service. Given the enormous price of Mamounia - from room charges to food and drink - we really would have wanted to be received with a warmer welcome. Th hotel was very busy including conferences/meetings and it was clear that there were just too few staff - not on for this price range hotel. Our biggest let-down was the food we had dinner in the Moroccan restaurant which was cold unheated again too few waiters for too many people (with a business dinner happening at the same time) I was waiting long times for my water glass to be refilled. The food was actually just average. Our starters (mezze) looked and tasted like the leftovers from the lunch buffet. Big disappointment. Overall our impression was the hotel was beautiful but cold (by service) and certainly overpriced (and overhyped).,Date of stay: December 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/399nadiah

I just spent 3 days at the Four Seasons in Casablance which was lovely and the stay at this hotel was suppose to be a step up. Just arrived and very disappointment. It's an okay hotel but would not consider it a luxury hotel or worth the $600 a night. I wish I as still at the Four Seasons. The room is dark and small and the hotel is old (but not a quaint old). Tried to check out of the hotel early but they wouldn't let me without charging me for my stay. They considered it a cancellation as opposed to checking out early. So they are forcing me to stay even thou I'm miserable!!

La Mamounia Marrakech,1x_2yz_3xyz wrote a review Nov 2016,40,The pool boys and their own business - no management attention ?,The La Mamounia is situated in the the Medina the very center of the town.  You can reach the Jemaa el-Fna the world famous place within 10 minutes by feet.    Before beeing transformed to a hotel it was a palace what is still noticeable in the rooms and their furniture.    What further is remarkable is the huge and beautiful garden area.    The buffet breakfast is served beside the big pool and leaves nothing to be desired.  A team of cooks prepares all kinds of dishes with eggs.    But something special is the pool. I was wondering that already early in the morning when I went to the breakfast all sunbeds in the front line were occupied which was marked with magazines. Later in the evening surprisingly the pool boys collected all the magazines and hid them in their welcome desk. Next day I realized that they run their own business modell: for a nice bakschisch (=tip) they offered you a sunbed in the first row !

La Mamounia Marrakech,louisa_bella_s wrote a review Nov 2016,50,Lovely afternoon tea,We did not stay here - we only came for the afternoon tea in the gardens. We were worried about the dress code since we heard from numerous people that they often turn people away at the door if they are not dressed nicely enough. However we had no issues (I wore a simple cotton dress with dressy sandals and my husband wore dress pants and dress shirt).  We booked the tea online by e-mail at Le Menzeh Bar but it seemed as though you could just show up without a booking (this was in late October though so I'm not sure if it is normally more busy or not).  The price was 220MAD per person. Pricey but worth it for the luxurious experience. We were served Moroccan mint tea with Moroccan pastries and French macarons. They were delicious. After the tea we wandered around the expansive gardens and grounds of the hotel. There were so many wonderful photo opportunities all over.

La Mamounia Marrakech,alireece wrote a review Nov 2016,50,Incredible,Having always wanted to stay in La Mamounia I was looking forward to my short trip to Marrakesh however I was a little nervous as most of the famous hotels I have stayed in have never been as good as there reputation. However La mamounia outdid all the expectations that I had of it.    As expected there was someone to pick me and my friend from the airport and take us to the airport which only takes 10minutes. Just inside the old cities walls it has a great location next to the souk old mosque and markets. The rooms were unlike most nice hotels were decorated in a Moroccan design which made the room special.  All the staff in the hotel whether at reception concierge or in the restaurants/bars were very nice and attentive. The food as well was really good and they had a good range of local and international.    Perhaps the most impressive part of the hotel was its facilities and grounds. They facilities inside the hotel are amazing. Of course the famous marble room is as as incredible as it is famous. The indoor pool and the spa is as good as any other 5-star hotel. But the grounds are the hidden gem of this hotel. The gardens are amazing with fresh oranges and limes growing which you can pick and eat fresh. There is a coffee shop in the middle of the grounds and some random amazing Moroccan buildings. They are defiantly worth exploring.    In summary La mamounia outlived the expectations that my friends and I had and is up there with the best hotel I have stayed in and defiantly the best city hotel I have stayed in.,Date of stay: November 2016,,"Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alireece

La Mamounia Marrakech,pittman64 wrote a review Nov 2016,20,Beautiful hotel - service needs revamped,To clarify - I am not writing about a stay at the hotel but merely for my experience walking about the grounds and also eating and having drinks at their bar lounge.    Their food is very good and they have a nice selection of drinks too. I went for lunch and since the experience was positive I decided to return for dinner. However it took over 15 minutes to order a beer. The manager apologized but receiving my check for the beer also took another 10 minutes. I was going to eat for dinner but had to forego this option with the fear that my dinner would take over an hour to be served or not at all. It's clear that while the bar lounge is a hopping place with great live jazz music the service needs to be updated. This is specific to dinner time and not lunch; my experience in the bar lounge for lunch has been great. I greatly enjoy the hotel grounds ambience and overall experience but thought this tidbit on service in the evening be mentioned for future patrons who may come just to get a drink or bite to eat and may not be staying at the hotel.

Though lunch for two was small (2 Kefta kebobs fries and 3 tea sandwiches 2 waters 1 cocktail) and very expensive ($100) and service slow and underwhelming (charging for a 3rd water we never received) the atmosphere more than makes up for it. Do take time to wander around the gardens and the various buildings (there's even an ice cream and beverage 'shack' in the middle of the garden) they are all beautiful and so photogenic.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Ray M wrote a review Oct 2016,30,Pompous and unwelcoming,We went there to see whether or not we'd like to book dinner for my wife's 50th birthday.  It didn't go well from the entrance which felt more like a military gatehouse where someone would come out and frisk us if we lingered too long. The hotel really needs to get a grip on this as it puts you off even going in. Once inside it's clinical and the sort of place where you are afraid you might be making too much noise. No greeting no welcome. Very cold (atmosphere wise) and the darkness doesn't help. Yes it's decorated well and yes it feels vaguely like a 5 star hotel but good interior design does not make a 5 star hotel! Obviously the grounds and gardens are immaculate but a visit to the restaurants again left us feeling unimpressed. One or two staff there did vaguely make an effort to show us the menu and chat but it was....an effort.  We've been to may fine hotels and restaurants in various parts of the world but we won't be going here and indeed did not book for dinner. Instead we found a restaurant whose food was sumptuous and whose service was impeccable yet we felt welcomed and valued. It's a shame as it could be good. I'd certainly be concerned if  I managed a hotel of this supposed standard and none of my restaurants made it into the top 20 in TA...not even close! At the prices they are charging they should be embarrassed too!,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Estepona, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raymJ3008UX
La Mamounia Marrakech,Aline Siqueira wrote a review Oct 2016,50,La Mamounia's Riad - Mesmerizing,"I spent some days in one ofi La Mamounia Hotel riads (riads are traditional moroccan houses with gardens and inner courtyards)    RIADS are also part of their accommodation scheme - as they are exclusive the price is quite expensive but if you are up for (and you can afford) one of the most exotic comfortable and luxurious experiences as a guest the price is only fair.    ( Fortunetely I didn't have to pay for it as I was on a work trip)    The riads are not part of main Mamounia's building and are a bit far from the hotel facilities like swimming pool restaurants spa etc but they definitely make up for it by providing a restful and serene enviroment with their own inner pateos gardens birds gazing not to mention the exquising room service provided by a exclusive butler - It was basically a hotel inside La Mamounia's hotel.    The ARCHITECTURE of the riad ( as well as Mamounia's areas) was quite impressive at least for me who loves moroccan building style. Everywhere ( and I mean every single part of the hotel) is very imposing with massive moroccan designed lines and shapes a sophisticated mosaic of tiny tiles compose big columns that remember a royal palace but the best part is definitely the light scheme - moroccan intricate (but flattering) shaped lamps made the ambience cozy and welcoming despite the colossal size of the whole building. ( I got lost several times!)    The SPA facility was another ""wow"" factor besides the staff was very professional and they offered excellent services  and products don't hesitate in buying their argan oil and Atlas mud mascara. Try the HAMMAN bath out - at first it might be akward to have someone conducting your shower but it's part of knowing more of their culture and it was an very singular experience.    If you are interested in shopping there are a couple of fancy BOUTIQUES inside the building like Dior for example.    There are 4 great restaurants inside La Mamounia I only tried the italian one and FOOD tasted like havean! Prices again are  quite exorbitant.    If a long period accommodation at La Mamounia is too expensive for your travel budget but you are still interested in knowing the hotel and everything it offers (it is worth!) you could easily spend a weekend as a guest or have a brunch at the swimming pool restaurant it is not that expensive and it is very popular among visitants that are not hotel guests food there is also good.    Overall I really enjoyed the whole experience the only thing is that there were so many facilities and sevices available (and of course I was completely mesmerized by the whole experience as I could never afford for such services and accomodation during my personal trips) that I didn't get to go out and truly explore the Medina as I wished (I like better to know the locals culture and the city I'm in rather than the hotel I am staying at) anyways it was terrifc!",Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,State of Sao Paulo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Siqueira-Aline
La Mamounia Marrakech,785markj wrote a review Oct 2016,50,World Class Luxury at La Mamounia,On a swelteringly arid day in Marrakesh we stopped by La Mamounia for some supper and a nightcap on the terrace. The hotel grounds are undeniably impressive with an enormous and well cared for walled garden. Our visit in July was in Marrakesh low season so the hotel was not particularly busy and the temperature was around 40 degrees.    Efficient and friendly table service on the terrace led us to order some Steak Hache an apple Martini an espresso martini wine and some extras. The food was very well prepared and served beautifully alongside candlelight. The cocktails were of international standard and the setting of the hotel was a very welcome retreat from the chaotic hubris of the city. You can relax on the comfortable sofas and day-seats on the terrace that leads down to the garden.    I had heard a lot about the Winston Churchill Bar (I think that's what's it's called) but it was closed on this occasion.    Tip: take a wander through the garden even at night it is atmospheric and peaceful.,Date of stay: July 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/785markj

La Mamounia Marrakech,Emil A wrote a review Oct 2016,50,An absolute examplery of customer service,There is not much one can add about this famous hotel whose name speaks for itself..  Yet two points I'd like to make which made our stay in Marrakech a wonderful experience. First is the level of customer service which they've demonstrated when we required moving the dates of our stay. We originally booked this hotel via Getaroom.com while planning our 3-day trip. Due to unforeseen circumstances the next day after the booking was made we had to move it just one day earlier for both arrival and departure. The service desk at Getaroom.com refused to make this change without applying a 50% charge for it (!) referring us to 'hotel cancellation policy'. I checked with the hotel and they confirmed that it was NOT their policy to charge in such circumstances (it was still 5 days before the arrival date). After numerous email between the hotel (which had also written directly to Getaroom.com) the booking site and myself the hotel made an exception and directly changed the booking dates without applying any charges to us! Isn't it what one would call an exemplary customer service?! So having said that I'd like to personally thank Ms Laila Afife at the Service des Reservations of La Mamounia for this truly caring and client oriented approach she took when dealing with our request. I also strongly recommend not to use Getaroom.com for hotel booking if you want to have any flexibility on dates and other changes.  And one more thing that made our stay there a great experience is the tour guide we booked at the hotel. This gentleman's name is Mohammed and he is probably the oldest guide working for this hotel with 30 years of experience just at La Mamounia! Make sure you book him in advance and your trip to Marrakech will become a lifetime experience!,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Moscow, Russia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emil_ea777

We booked a table on the terrace of the Italian Restaurant for 1pm and stayed there until 3pm.    The food was exceptional as was the service and the relaxed lunchtime ambiance.

La Mamounia Marrakech,mindythelion wrote a review Oct 2016,50,Iconic property with an exquisite history,We stayed at La Mamounia in October 2016 and it was one of the highlights of our three week stay in Marrakech.    It's a true 5-star resort with excellent professional service and breathtaking authentic Moroccan décor. The property itself is situated on lush gardens that are over two centuries old a gift from the Sultan to his son Moulay Mamoun for his wedding. In the early 1920's the first 100 rooms of the hotel were built followed by 100 more in the 1940's and one of it's points of fame is that Winston Churchill spent a lot of time here during and after the war to clear his mind.    History aside the hotel itself is elegant and beautiful and features a gorgeously serene indoor pool as well as a large outdoor pool that provides the backdrop for morning breakfast buffet-style with a huge array of options. The grounds are seemingly endless meticulously cared for and speckled with hidden areas to sit down and enjoy the ambiance.    There are four restaurants to choose from themed by geography: Le Français L’Italien Le Marocain or something more casual by the pool at Le Pavillon de la Piscine. Before dinner make sure you spend time in the beautiful lounge to enjoy a delicate cocktail and enjoy the live Moroccan music. It's a beautiful place to be for the transition between day and night as the space is illuminated with candles and moody lamp shadows after sunset.    La Mamounia is truly iconic and definitely worth a few nights stay while in Marrakech.    Pro tip: if you're taking a taxi say that you're going to the Place Bab Jdid roundabout which is kiddie corner to the main entrance of the hotel. Taxi drivers will often charge double or triple the standard rate if you say that you're going to La Mamounia because of it's reputation for attracting wealthy clientele (it should be 50-60 dirhams or $5-6 US maybe $7 but not more). Once you're close by just tell the driver to enter the Mamounia property.,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Vancouver, BC",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mindythelion

Chipped glassware and dry tasteless food.  I dropped over $100 on lunch that I will forever regret. In a trip-advisor world establishments need to up their game and not be lazy.

A host greeted us and gave us the background of the hotel and took care of everything (there's no standing in line or filling out paperwork). We were then given a tour of the grounds and led to our room.    The room was grand and beautiful. The minibar was stocked with cold water wine & beer. Fresh fruit was placed in the room daily. We immediately headed down to the saltwater pool (that's right no chlorine here). Staff sets up your chairs and towels and servers bring drinks.    The concierge was fantastic about setting things up with little direction. We were in a hurry and requested a tour guide and massage. Concierge arranged an extensive tour with a knowledgeable guide and arrange the perfect couples relaxing massage.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Jools3 wrote a review Oct 2016,50,Beautiful 5 star luxury - as it should be,La Mamounia is fabulous luxurious hotel which is truly 5 stars in the glamourous traditional way.    The customer service is impeccable and the suite we stayed in was immaculate. Everywhere is spotlessly clean and furnished in the highest quality Moorish-style furnishings. Our suite was decorated with thousands of intricate mosaic tiles and hand-painted ceilings and frescos. There was a large marble bathroom and the shower felt like your own Hamman. I could not fault the room at all it felt magical and a bit like being in an Arabian nights scene.    The pool is massive and attendants are quick to help you get comfy with soft white fluffy towels and relax. We were staying with breakfast included and the breakfast was extensive and delicious. Breakfast is a buffet style in the Le Pavillion restaurant but you can have fresh omelettes and eggs cooked made to order. It was lovely having breakfast whilst sitting over-looking the shimmering blue pool.    It is expensive to eat and drink in the hotel restaurants for dinner about £90 (900 dirhams) for the three course menu at the Le Marocain restaurant. There are restrictions on how much Moroccan currency you can take into Morocco from the UK approximately £200 per person equivalent. Don’t make the annoying mistake that we did which was changing money London Gatwick and only got 8 Dirham to the pound. When we arrived at Marrakech airport there were decent exchange counters giving 12 Dirhams to the pound.    The hotel spa also looked gorgeous and we enjoyed trying the Jacuzzi.    This hotel is costly but it is an amazing opulent retreat whilst still being within the Medina and not far away from the atmospheric bustling souk.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Guildford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jools3

The grounds are magnificent. The sculpture in the gardens was unexpected whimsical and delightful. The pool is beyond gorgeous. The level of service is 6 star (they neeed to add one just for La Mamounia).  The best meal of our luxury visit to Marrakesh had to be the prix fixe at the Marroccan restaurant at La Mamounia. We sat in the garden while the sun was setting feasting on 3 courses of traditional food. We were 3 people so we tried many dishes and loved the sweet and savory.  We asked to see the Winston Churchill sweet. The manager showed it to us. Fun to see a bit of history.

La Mamounia Marrakech,AnthonyVNYC1021 wrote a review Sep 2016,50,Fit for a King,Dear Traveler    My loved one and I were told by several well-heeled and chic friends Marrakech is a magical place. A must visit at least once in a life time. So for my 50th Birthday we decided to embark on this glamorous and exciting trip. A city of many cultures and influences. Where old traditions meet the modern world. There is a Palace that is fit for a King. Its name La Mamounia Hotel and Resort. This magnificently appointed hotel has been fully renovated to its full grand glory. You can feel the history as you move throughout the hotel and property. It is Lawrence of Arabia meets Ali Baba a true fantasy where 6 star luxury is the main objective. The hotel is run under the General Director of Monsieur Pierre Jochem who certainly must be a very seasoned hotelier. The 17 acre grounds of manicured gardens are so beautiful one has difficulty focusing on one specific horticulture planting. The Staff each and every one of them are kind attentive engaging and extremely willing to please your every need. La Mamounia has set a new bar of what is the meaning of service fit for royalty. It is the philosophy that is applied to each and every guest. There are 4 amazing restaurants on the property. A Moroccan French Italian and an outside bistro area for late afternoon and evening bites. There is something for every palette. One could never leave La Mamounia if they choose not too but exploring Marrakesh with the professional guidance of the Concierge Team makes it effortless. If it is disco dancing till dawn smoking at hookah bar or dining in the best Michelin star eatery’s. Marrakesh has it all and the only place to stay is La Mamounia!

La Mamounia Marrakech,Miguel V wrote a review Sep 2016,20,Not impressed with the staff attitude at the gate.,We had every intention of staying at La Mamounia but when we arrived to the gate the security staff there told us we couldn't come in as my long shorts didn't quite cover my knees. So we had to return to our previous accomodation change and return - losing 1 hour. I was then told I couldn't take my small backpack inside despite only having camera equipment inside. To add insult to injury we were forced to go through a metal detector and searched. Not what you expect when going into an expensive hotel with the intention of booking a stay.  Thinking this must be a very special place we put up with this treatment at the gate but soon realised as we got inside that this was nothing special to us. Although the decor was lavish it wasn't to our tastes and the snooty attitude of the reception staff quickly made myself and my wife decide we'd be better off at the Riad where we had been staying at 20% of the price with 100% better staff attitude. We didn't even bother staying for a drink at the bar. It was clear to us the staff we met there weren't happy in their jobs either.

The rooms are beautifully done with rich and elegant decor the linens and beds are truly fit for a princess! This is a luxury property and nothing is spared to make your stay just that! From the moment we walked in we were impressed with the beauty and elegance! The service at the hotel is impressive with staff very respectful but that is expected because of the clientele. We spent most of our time at the pool which is stunning and faces the beautiful gardens. The breakfast is ok nothing to write home about. My daughter had dinner at the Italian Resturant and although expensive the food and service was excellent.  We had a ground floor room with direct access to the gardens. Although the room was impeccable getting down to the room through the lobby and past the service doors below can feel like you are staying in the basement but you have another entrance through the gardens. If you don't want a ground level room staff are happy to move you to another category.  Walk the grounds use the indoor pool and spa relax and be pampered at this beautiful palace! Your wallet will suffer but you won't be disappointed.  Only issue we had was the wifi that didn't work so great but otherwise stay was beautiful!  We will definitely be back!    PS: please not this property is very close to the road and to the medina so we got followed by some guy who later approached us at the medina and said he worked at the hotel security and narrated seeing us arrive that day! I later saw the same guy that night outside the hotel and mentioned it to staff. There are plenty of people trying to get you to use them as guides and can pretend to work at the hotel!

La Mamounia Marrakech,Barbara S wrote a review Sep 2016,40,"I really wanted to give five stars, but....",I am a solo female traveler and for the most part I loved my stay here. In fact when the noisy guests in the adjoining room started to chain smoke they moved me to a new room and gave me a complimentary massage in the spa for my trouble. That was handled very well. I ended up eating several meals in the Italian bar and the food was OK and the service fine but not friendly. Today I had clearly finished eating and my waitress was just 20 feet away deep in very loud conversation with two other colleagues. I was relaxing reading the NY times but it got quite loud. I wanted another drink and for the food to be removed. Despite many glances her way she couldn't be bothered to come over. I finally had to flag her over. I tipped her anyway; it's an American habit but she did not earn it. I just never felt welcomed as a solo female in that bar despite the fact that I was there at least three times. The Spa was great however there is construction in the casino. Try relaxing to the sound of hammers and drills etc. Once loud music helped and another time I had to move rooms in the middle of my treatment. I'd think a discount structure would have worked well under these circumstances. Everyone was very responsive friendly and helpful. The hotel is gorgeous! I was very happy I took a swim in the indoor pool on my first day since it closed down after that. The outdoor pool is very nice and the attendants friendly. Service in both the Italian bar and the pool bar is a bit slow. I don't know just couldn't bring myself to give five stars. I think mostly because there were too many times when I felt weird being a solo female. It was a vibe I got more than anything. I am glad I chose to stay here; no regrets.

This ambience was spectacular and the caliber of service on par with what I would expect in a luxury hotel. Upon arrival we were guided through to the Moroccan restaurant and seated in a stunning private area. The decor was lovely and the tableware (yes i pay attention to those things) equally as good! We ordered the pigeon and lobster pastellas and they were very good. The pigeon one was exceptional - try this if you come here!    The live entertainment was all great - quiet enough that we could eat dinner and talk without raising our voices but loud enough it was there. The Mains were good but we were stuffed by this point. The staff were so lovely they brought us out macaroons with rose ice-cream and a candle and the live entertainment came over to sing at our table! It was a rally nice gesture. We went for a look around the grounds and they were stunning! I would recommend coming here for a special dinner!,Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/renusaini9

La Mamounia Marrakech,Julien C wrote a review Aug 2016,50,Outstanding service. Beautiful garden. Clearly among the best hotels in Morocco.,Stayed there one night in a suite. Impeccable service at all touch points.  The quality of food is just impressive by its diversity and freshness with a lot of locally and homemade ingredients (jam bread sauces).  Design is a bit dated but charming as fully inspired by traditional arts and using local techniques.  The best service you can get in Morocco for such a large hotel.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Mike62MB wrote a review Aug 2016,40,"Top quality, but not sure its worth the top price - Le Morroccan",We were recommended the dine at Le Moroccan at La Mamounia with it being the premier hotel in the Medina with the best Moroccan restaurant in Marrakech.    Certainly on arrival and as were were led through this opulent hotel you certainly felt that everything was pointing in that direction.    Our service was first class our waiter was exceptional and together with his team of four assistants they certainly catered to our every need.    His recommendations on starters and mains were consistent and gave us quite a sampling of the cuisine but with it being at the end of our stay we had sampled many of these dishes before and to be honest we had a feeling that the food quality was similar to some of the previous meals which were a quarter of the cost.    What you are paying for here is exceptional service in extremely opulent settings so if that is something you wish to experience then by all means book however I would balance this against the overall experience of La Comptoir Dama and the authenticity of La Foundak.    Perhaps more for couples or indeed Muslim families seeking the privacy of dining with your family behind a curtain and hidden from the other patrons as I can see the appeal then. I would go again but certainly not with the kids.,Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mike62MB

The pool is divine the decor is sumptuous without being overstated and the atmosphere is calm and a welcome respite after a day spent in the medina. I would highly recommend booking in a treatment or two at the spa as well.    A few more English TV channels with movies would be the only recommendation.

They had put a bottle of champagne in our room for arrival however when we told them we don't drink they removed it and did not replace it with an alternative. Toiletries in the bathroom seemed watered down not a great standard for a world class hotel. The rooms are small also. I have to say the room service is quick. This is the first 5 star hotel i have stayed in where there are no tea and coffee facilities. When I enquired they abruptly answered it was chargeable. Some of the waiters are very pleasant however some are extremely arrogant and rude especially in the Italian bar. Actually I ordered lunch but was totally put off by the waiting staff so left. Food very highly priced and not that exceptional. Give breakfast a miss. Nothing special and very expensive. The doormen are extremely friendly. Turndown service is OK but again not that special touch like a five star hotel should have. Big plus is the location and the surroundings. Management need to visit some 5 star hotels to see where they are going wrong.

We had a hammam massage lunch and access to their indorr and outdoor pools. This hotel is so drop dead gorgeous. It has the traditional Moroccan architecture and decorations while also being modern. The hammam is a massage that feels rough because of the mitt they use. You are scrubbed down with black soap(make sure you buy some in the souk)  You are washed down a few moew times by hand.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Adrien H wrote a review Aug 2016,10,Terrible service and pretentious hotel,"Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in August. Having been many times in Marrakech we wanted to visit and try this historical ""palace"". What a disappointment !    First I was impressed by the beauty of the building which is I have to admit nice and in good state (including the large garden).    But the service is terrible and slowly ruins the experience. Some of the staff seem like they do not care what you are asking them (and I speak french). It is an overall feeling but here are some examples :    -Asked concierge to carry a bag to the room as we were leaving for dinner outside. When we got back the concierge gave us the bag back for us to take into the room.    -As I had booked a spa treatment and was relaxing in the jacuzzi near by I asked one of the pool boys to call me 10 minutes before said treatment. He said he would warn me and after a certain period of time and not seeing the guy I went to the spa. I was 10 minutes late. Here I must say that the spa experience was good so thanks and congratulations to the spa staff for being the only department in the hotel up to their reputation.    -The vendors from the shops inside the hotel (Prada & co) as they barely have any customer spend their time chatting and sitting in arm chairs in the corridor. Is this really what staff does in a ""palace"" ???    -Housekeeping is bad as well. We received a cheap wine bottle as amenity on the first day and it was NEVER taken away as well as 4 empty water bottles. I had to put them outside the room and call HK to collect it. Moreover in the toilets tiling was broken.    -On the first breakfast buffet (which is INSIDE) was INFESTED BY BEES. This I had never seen. It was surrealist and actually a bit funny to see other guests avoiding the bees spot (the fruit buffet) or trying to get inside by other doors while staff well... they looked like everything was okay. Our waiter comes to ask us is ""everything is fine""... I cannot resist mentioning the bees and to tell him that they just would have to close doors next to the buffet and open one a bit further away for guests to go through. He did not offer to bring any fruit to our table or anything. Only an explanation that bees are attracted by the sweet fruits. I think we have noticed thanks.  Moreover buffet (when you can get to it) is very common.    In conclusion When you go to a five star hotel which presents itself as a palace you expect your mind to be blown away to spend an amazing time flawless. That is why you pay the price. Instead I spent my time thinking ""it is okay it is just a detail"" but there is a point it ruins the experience. When finally we got charged 1200 MAD for a trip to a Gueliz shop and back that was it...    I would recommend the Four Seasons or the Sofitel for a better experience.",Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Lausanne, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/136adrienh
La Mamounia Marrakech,Sohail S wrote a review Aug 2016,10,Worst experience of my life.,"""A symbol of traditional Moroccan hospitality"" I think you meant to say a symbol of rude customer service with snobby racist judgemental employees. I've been to Morocco numerous times and stayed at some prestigious places such as the Royal Mansour. I read some good reviews about la Mamounia but never had the chance to visit until now. Dressed in traditional Moroccan attire me and my family decided to pop into Mamounia for a look around and to get some food. From the very onset we were treated with discontent welcomed at the door with a ""what do you want?"" and a ""come back tomorrow"". I told them we only wished to get some drinks to quench our thirst from the scorching heat and to have dinner to which they replied ""we have a dress code"". I found this hard to believe as I observed other visitors of Caucasian (white) heritage dressed in shorts and slippers enter without hassle. Which leaves me to believe your employees are racists and that me and my family were victims of it (my ethnic origin is south asian).    Never in my life have I felt so embarrassed. I did not have the patience to argue or ask to speak to a manager nor did I wish to create a scene and cause embarrassment to Mamounia. Not when I have been made to stand in the 45 degree heat for so long by your employees. So me and my family simply walked away.    Money has no dress code. I would not be wanting to eat there if I couldn't afford it. Also if you dont consider traditional Moroccan attire as suitable then stop using the words ""traditional"" on your website.

That said here are my impressions:  -I've stayed in luxury hotels before but this one had an unnecessarily snooty attitude. Rather than being treated like an honored guest I got more of a ""you're LUCKY to be staying here with us"" kind of vibe from the staff. Do not care for this and for this reason would not stay here again.  -The pool is very nice -- water temp was perfect.  -Was watched like a hawk when walking into one of the luxury boutiques in the hotel. Might have been inclined to make a purchase had this not been the case but it made me very uncomfortable and I left right away.  -Room/bath products/view from room all lovely.  -Breakfast buffet by the pool was fine. Our server was a pleasant gentleman. The food was fine. The setting was nice.  -We used a driver from the hotel to transport us to our next destination. He was very polite and we liked him very much.  -This is not necessarily a review or reflection of the hotel but something travelers should be aware of nonetheless: not once but TWICE upon leaving the hotel by foot we were approached a short distance away by men claiming to be hotel staff who had just been let off of work.

The hotel had a major renovation a few years ago so it has aged well.    Too expensive to stay for us but we stopped in to have lunch. Although the staff is welcoming and there's not a dress code it's best to dress up just a bit if you go there. You don't need to be dripping with diamonds just not ripped jeans and a tank top (unless you're a rock star of course). An American couple just ahead of us wanted to go in to look around but they were wearing shorts T-shirts and flipflops so there weren't let in. We just wore khakis collared shirts and decent shoes and we had no problem.    Since it was during the Christmas holidays the hotel was busy and lunch at the pool was only a buffet which was way to pricey for us.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Janine K wrote a review Jul 2016,30,La Mamounia - La Marocain,"We stayed for a week in Marrakech with our two daughters. Service at our hotel - the Four Seasons - was exemplary. Other highlights included La Maison Arabe La Sultana and Richard Branson's Kasbah Tamadot in the Atlas Mountains. We booked dinner at La Marocain restaurant at La Mamounia expecting it to be a highlight of our holiday. The hotel and gardens are beautiful and fully lived up to expectations. Unfortunately the restaurant was a disappointment. At first we were seated outside next to where some big lighting equipment was being dismantled and packed up (there had clearly been an earlier function). This was clearly noisy and intrusive and we asked for a different table. We were then seated inside which was fine but not a great start. We then ordered drinks and were a bit shocked at the price of 80 dirhams for a Fanta. This would not have been so bad if the service had been wonderful but it absolutely was not. Our waitress (lady in a black trouser suit) could not have been less friendly. When bringing the bread selection she did not even offer our daughters a choice saying ""this is best for the children"" as she dumped a roll on each of their plates. Our daughters (9 and 12) are perfectly capable of choosing their own bread! At 750 dirhams for 2 courses one would expect the food to be good. I was surprised there was no amuse bouche. I was also surprised to be asked who was having what when the food arrived. It did not feel like a high end dining experience. Two of us had the spiny lobster tagine. The dish consisted of half a small lobster 3 asparagus 2 cherry tomatoes and 3 olives. I do not have a big appetite but this was a ridiculously small (and very expensive) dish. Others had the mixed grill and a beef dish which were very good. Desserts were also good. Overall the service lacks charm and finesse. The experience should be better in a hotel of this calibre. It was the most expensive meal we had in Marrakech and the least enjoyable.",Date of stay: July 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/374janinek

La Mamounia Marrakech,Ghentleman wrote a review Jul 2016,40,Glamorous Hotel,Décor is Disney style-Moroccan which in some places works and in others is downright soulless and gaudy. The public areas look like the palaces of the city with intricate and colorful decorations covering the ceilings huge cushions and grand chandeliers. Corridors are exceptionally dark making it hard to find one's room! This is not the place for an intimate Marrakeshi stay but more like somewhere to see and be seen: pose. Front of house staff are robotic and unfriendly in our experience while pool staff are warm and helpful.    There are four restaurants within the property: Moroccan French Italian and the pool pavilion. All are soulless and commercial in feel. The poolside lunch buffet is impressive and very good quality. Of the four bars one is intimate which is hidden behind the pool and is a gem. The spa is jarring with bright blue and orange walls; the indoor pool on site of the previous restaurant is impressively Romanesque. Tennis court location and a glass walled gym looking out to the acres of gardens are well thought through.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Andrew M wrote a review Jun 2016,40,Beautiful,The rooms and ground were gorgeous. The majority of staff were rather difficult to deal with and rather unpleasant. I had one of the best back massages I've ever had from the spa. However the atmosphere was uncomfortable. For example I arrived early for my massage and instead of taking me to a place to relax I had to wait in the locker room which did not have a lounging area. At times the communication from the staff was unclear. Also the robes were child sized and when I asked the staff for a larger size they just said to wrap myself in a towel and put the robes over. I had to walk around the spa in co-ed areas like this. The pool was amazing but sadly was closed for maintenance. The customer service was just very poor and felt constantly interrupted by staff with our door bell being rung 10+ times during our less than 24 hour stay.    I would most certainly tour the gorgeous hotel and get a day pass to the pool but I would avoid staying here. Save your money and stay at a riad where the service is 100x better.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewmM7991CZ
La Mamounia Marrakech,Paula Fletcher wrote a review Jun 2016,40,"Lovely gardens, great patio for cocktails",This historic hotel has been modernised to within an inch of its life and the interior is similar to hotel interiors in any part of the world but once you get outside it is a totally different story. The gardens are beautiful extending to nearly 20 acres they grow their own produce have a work force of 15 gardeners and do some rather interesting things like painting the odd large cactus bright red. Not good for the plant l am sure but visually stunning nonetheless. The cocktails on the terrace overlooking the gardens were extremely good as was the service and the 'nibbles' provided with the drinks. My only criticism and it is a big one bearing in mind the quality of the hotel was that the white covers of the chairs and sofas on the terrace were stained dirty and not nice to sit on at all.

La Mamounia Marrakech,TerryMinuit wrote a review Jun 2016,50,Breathtakingly good.,Perfect. Pricey but well-worth it. The bedroom was sumptuous. The staff were delightful. Breakfast was calm relaxing and no rushing around of people at the buffet areas.    Dinner in the traditional restaurant was lovely.    The hotel is a pleasant 10 minute walk to the main square (just a little bravery needed when tackling crossing the roads generally). Saying that the pool grounds and facilities are such that there is no reason to leave the hotel if you just want to relax and do nothing.    Finally the drive from the airport is no more than 5 or 6 minutes.,Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TerryMinuit
La Mamounia Marrakech,Gellybaby24 wrote a review Jun 2016,30,Spa day,We paid £112 to visit here for the day.  The hotel pool was nice but it was nothing in comparison to the pools where we were staying. There is an indoor pool however with a little lounge area in the middle of the pool which is fantastic. The spa day included use of all facilities lunch in the French restaurant and a hammam. The lunch was amazing. However we were disappointed with the hammam. The therapist was quite rough they didn't help escort you from one part to the other as they do with the Turkish baths. It felt quite rushed so in actual fact we were probably paying for the lunch more than anything. The hotel is a great building from the outside but the décor inside does not appeal to me much. It is very dark and quite old fashioned but good to visit and see for the day.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gellybaby24

I would recommend to stay at least two nights to really soak it in. The gym is really nice as well if you want to work out good cardio machines and weights.

La Mamounia Marrakech,by OSQUARE wrote a review Jun 2016,50,Amazing Moroccan experience!,When you are in Marrakech and have the chance to visit La Mamounia you should! It is the most stunning and extraordinary hotel in Marrakech. The impressive Islamic architecture extenuates the hotel’s beauty. We were not even 2 minutes inside and we already fell for the craved marble columns and mosaic patterns all over the lobby. It all got even better: upon arriving we were treated with a traditional Moroccan welcome: a cold glass of a very tasty almond milk and a platter of dates the best combination of tastes!    After a hotel tour it was pretty much time for some lunch at the poolbar. The service at the lunch was outstanding couldn´t have imagined it any better. The food is really good full of flavor interesting and most importantly DELICIOUS. One cool thing about the food at La Mamounia is that they harvest all the fruits and vegetables they use in their dishes. This way you know it’s of the best quality and it is such a nice thing to know.    We would recommend this hotel to everyone!

It's a vast complex very beautiful architecturally with incredibly beautiful gardens and a sight to behold. It's quite expensive to stay but you can visit it as just a visitor to have a look around for free or to use the restaurant.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Jetman82 wrote a review Jun 2016,50,Probably the best hotel in the world!,This stunning property with its exemplary attention to detail and amazingly friendly and professional staff has to be if not the best one of the best hotels in the world! With such a reputation and steeped in so much history and beauty to boast hotel La Mamounia has to be on every travelers list. Your experience begins from the very moment you are received by the hotel chauffeur at the airport. Once at the lobby you are warmly welcomed with traditional dates and milk and it is at this moment while taking in all the beauty and opulence the property has to offer that you realize that this is a hotel like no other. The property and the surrounding gardens speak for themselves. To be completely honest words alone will not do justice to the hotel or the people that staff it it must be experienced for ones-self.  The city of Marrakech which has been made popular by celebrities such as actor Tom Cruise and fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent who made Marrakech his home itself is rich in history and culture and has many surprises for those who wish to wonder its narrow alleyways in search of its next hidden gem which could be a beautiful raid for a meal or a bargain to be had in one of its many souks.  Though shortWe thoroughly enjoyed our visit with thanks to the hotel and the amazing staff and it will remain as one of our fondest memories yet.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Philip O wrote a review May 2016,20,Terrace Bar at the Mamounia - so disappointing!,Although we did not stay at the famous Mamounia we felt that our trip to Marrakesh would not be complete without checking it out. So we decided to go for cocktails and bar food on the terrace. There is no doubt that the hotel and grounds are beautiful but that's as far as it goes. In truth the hotel could have been anywhere in the world - there was nothing exceptional about it except the prices of the cocktails - which were out of this world. A Bellini cost the equivalent of £25 sterling! And whilst we are on the subject of the cocktails they were dreadful. My wife's Cosmopolitan was so bad she sent it back twice and then didn't drink it. The waiter just laughed at her. The good thing is that at least we know we missed nothing by not staying at this hotel - one more off the bucket list!,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philipo530

La Mamounia Marrakech,Thebadr1 wrote a review May 2016,10,Very terrible experience,I went 2 days ago with a friend who visited me from abroad. We were stopped at the door by a lady security who was very rude and sarcastic as my friend was wearing shorts. I asked her if this dress code that sounds weird applies on everyone or only us and she said everyone but at the same time a couple who looked Europeans entered the hotel and the gentleman was wearing short but of course he was greeted and let him in. I didn't want to ask further because it will just make it worse and made me lose the face infront of my guest. What the rude lady didn't know is that she has to deal with customers with respect and needs to empathize. What the rude lady didn't know is that we wanted to dine in mamounia for the first time. What the rude lady didn't know is how to deal with customers. With a hotel like yours I believe you need to put staff who are trustworthy and genuine on their service. To wrap up: I will never go back to this hotel I will make sure that all the people I know wether in Morocco or outside the country will never go there even for a visit. It's so shame to hear about the hotel that is the best but the fact is it's the worst that I have seen in my life and in my experiences around the world.

La Mamounia Marrakech,TallTravels29 wrote a review May 2016,50,Fabulous Spa Day experience!,I booked the Spa Day pass for myself and my mom as a special treat. The hammam and scrub were wonderfully relaxing (the scrub is quite thorough and you come out of it with baby soft skin). The grounds are gorgeous and it was lovely to just walk around enjoying the birdcalls and smell of the rose creepers and jasmine. We had lunch on the patio at the French restaurant and the food was STUNNING. Easily one of the best meals of my life. Everything from the appetiser to dessert was flawless and after a meal of this quality it's easy to see why La Mamounia was voted worlds best hotel.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Thrillsbury wrote a review May 2016,50,A truly special place,La Mamounia is in a class of its own. From the welcome drink and private check-in to the incredible spacious rooms and the immaculate garden grounds this hotel delivers on its promise. Sadly we had only one night here but I wouldn't trade it for anything. It is as well run and luxurious as the reviews and accolades attest. I had the lowest category room and was completely satisfied. If I had been on a romantic vacation I would suggest upgrading at least one category so you have a view of the beautiful gardens but as a solo traveler my view of the parking lot and entrance was just fine. The bed was heavenly and the bathroom though a tad dark was just perfect. Little things like a heated towel bar were most appreciated. As good as the room was the Jaques Grange designed public spaces were a feast for the eyes. We spent the first afternoon at the indoor pool with some of the most attentive but understated service I have ever experienced. If you needed something a simple glace was all that was required. Otherwise you were left alone to relax and indulge. I did not have time to try any services at the spa but from the looks of it I can assume it is probably quite good. All of the bars are great and Le Francais was a delicious if unremarkable restaurant. One must walk the grounds of La Mamounia. Words would not do justice for this pastoral respite in the middle of the incredibly frenetic Medina. At the far end is a vegetable garden that provides some of the produce for the hotel and it was in full spring bloom. We had a late flight out the day of departure and the hotel was very welcoming of us staying at the pool for the afternoon. They urged us to use the showers and dressing areas of the spa if necessary (and it was) and we felt very comfortable in doing so. This hotel is very expensive and that should not come as a surprise to anyone staying there. But I should point out it's not out of proportion to other hotels in Marrakech of the same stature (ie Royal Mansoor). If you can afford the experience I promise it will be an unforgettable one.,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Los Angeles, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thrillsbury

La Mamounia Marrakech,MickeyCeroc wrote a review May 2016,30,Mixed experience,I stayed here a number of times in the long and distant past and it was tired but gorgeous. The revamp has been done to the highest of standards and looks amazing. However .....  I tried to book a room the night before arriving and was told no one was at reservations until the morning. My husband and I tried over three separate telephone called to book the night beforehand and only after demanding to speak to a manager could we make the booking.  We were upgraded and the suite was outstanding in all respects but for having no view! Would have preferred a lesser room and a balcony overlooking the famous gardens than room 100 which looks over a service area or has other rooms balconys looking into your room. For one night it didn't matter and it was an upgrade but if I had paid in full for that suite I would not have been impressed.  The hotel pools and grounds are amazing. However my guests of one adult and two young children were charged a phenomenal 150euros to join us for lunch and that didn't include the lunch bill which was high of course but expected in such an enviroment. Worst still the hotel was so keen to charge me for guests that I was beckoned whilst swimming and made to sign the bill for my guests whilst IN the swimming pool. Later on I was accused of not being the guest I signed myself in as said I had signed the wrong name and I had to repeat my name a number of times over and there was a lot of back and forth before the waiter realised it was his mistake and slopped off without an apology.  So yes it is a wonderful hotel location gardens rooms etc. all outstanding but a shame for the points I raised.,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MickeyCeroc

La Mamounia Marrakech,Adi C wrote a review Apr 2016,30,Nice but below expectation.,I have spent with my wife 4 days in this hotel.  Having heard so much about this hotel since long time - and always like to try best hotels when ever we can - LM was a must.  We leave with a mixed feelings because this hotel goes from very good to even poor in certain aspects.    What really will surprise you in LM:    History of this property . LM is a classic like Raffles in Singapore or Oriental in Bangkok.    Architecture. Amazing piece of nice architectural with unique arab design. Floors  walls  courtyards  simply amazing .    Gardens. Simply Wow. Pretty -nice -peaceful -manicured - relaxing - luxury.  This is not an hotel with a garden is a park with an hotel.  Though one day we saw one staff operating a machine compressor spraying with insecticide the garden with people walking around and even worst himself was not wearing a mask. Being myself Agriculture Engineer I can say that is not the way to take care of the staff applying the chemical.    Rooms . Though they are very small in size for a super 5 star hotel - stayed in a standard room - the design is pleasent and nice in general mainly due to the architecture.    A big problem in the room is the shower. Is so small that u cannot even stretch your elbows. Is smaller than one meter wide  and is open to the main bathroom so lots of water comes outside flooding the outside area and dangerous as you can easily slip.  Impossible the management has not realized this as I could read other similar comments in TA thus they know but don't want to come with a simple solution such as a curtain or glass door or just add to the floor 5 centimeter border to hold partially the water .    Cleaning. Very good room cleaning .    Things we did not like :    The lobby and public area Interior is definitely not a plus in LM. Very boring design with dull colors and poor lighting .  The simple yellowish and reddish color all along the public area is too simple and no nice.  The upholstery of all sofas and arm chairs are so dark  monotone color and no interesting design.  I can imagine beauty is in the eye of the beholder but this is far too simple and boring design for anyone.    Attention to detail. Definitely this is a big minus for me .  If you brag of being the best hotel worldwide in 2015 you should follow what other big name hotels do such as :    Limo wzout wifi in the car.  No tea and coffee facilities in the room.  Very very limited minibar. No chocolate  no cookies. U need to call room service to get them.  No touch in the evening turn down service . In any top hotel you get cookies or chocolate or a little present or a card  or simply a bottle of water next to your bed side table . None was provided during our stay.    No free shoe shine service    No butler service in all rooms    No toothbrush . After paying 600 dollars a day u must provide full amenities.    The service is not like in Asia. We counted only two staff who greeted and smiled at us . Hassan and Hammou in the breakfast restaurant . Rest will never give u a smile and hardly a greeting salute. We even asked those staff why people don't smile !    The breakfast was another problem when u can see so many birds coming inside the buffet and helping themselves eating all over . Not hygiene to take food where birds have been staving and eating before me . Staff could see the birds eating but did not - or could not - do anything.    Did not want to try other outlets after reading so many negative comments but probably we should have a try.    There are more lack of details but don't want to be so negative  but far from being the best hotel in service and attention to details compare to other yearly hotel winners.    In general nice stay but below expectation.,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Phuket Town, Thailand",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adic2014

La Mamounia Marrakech,nat1774 wrote a review Apr 2016,50,Oriental fairytale,La Mamounia is an oasis in the busy city of Marrakech! This hotel has such a spirit it's unbelievable. By entering the hotel you have this incredible beautiful smell of dattes and you are immediately in a different time and space...We especially enjoyed our daily walks through this amazing parc..kind of meditative...you can really see that the gardeners love their job... no words can describe this beauty! It is definitely a grand hotel! Breakfast was very nice as well as the lunch and the brunch at the pool. The italian restaurant was for me overpriced and lived definitely not up to the expectations except for the tiramisu..what a treat!!!! Mehdi that served us at breakfast and lunch does definitely know how to treat the customer he is such a friendly person and does a great service!!!! The staff around the pool was kind of demotivated what was striking me is that when you have a tip ready in your hands they do serve you way differently! That's a fact!  The spa is very nice and the products they use are lovely. I do highly recommend this hotel however be aware of that EVERYTHING is very expensive but i guess for such a palace that's the price you have to pay! Thank you for making my birthday so special! I will be back to this magical place!,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"San Francisco, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nat1774
La Mamounia Marrakech,jks_ca wrote a review Apr 2016,40,Disappointing,It may be inevitable that a hotel with such hype will elicit disappointment. The grounds and the facilities are of course superb but the rooms leave much to be desired. Ours had a lousy floor plan with so much space wasted in corridors. The shower had no door or curtain so the bathroom was flooded every time we used it. Who designs stuff like this is truly baffling.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Jon H wrote a review Apr 2016,50,A Visit To Marrakech Isn't Complete Without It,There are few places in this world that I would ever give more than 4 stars to and La Mamounia is one of them at 4.5 stars.    My visit to La Mamounia was soul enriching their beautiful gardens are the best I've seen in all of Marrakech. The service of staff and customer experience was very good although unengaging.    Although I would love to give La Mamounia 5 stars I did notice some areas where improvements could be made and as such the 5* experience in my view is still something to work towards.    It is important to bear in mind that I am reviewing this hotel in its own category as as a 5 star hotel. As such a 4 star review for a fast food place is not at all comparable.    La Mamounia is most certainly a wondrous example of luxury at its finest and I cannot stress that enough. In my eyes visiting Marrakech without La Mamounia is a visit wasted it is a landmark of success and achievement in Moroccan culture and excellence and should be visited by all.    Dislikes include that the ground floor bathroom cubicles were cramped and slightly too dimly lit I banged my elbow on the wall when trying to turn around. In addition to this the hotel restaurants did not serve Moroccan food until the evening which was disappointing given that every other element of the hotel was so culturally rich.    In summary don't go to Marrakech without visiting La Mamounia. If it is out of your budget then certainly visit the bar/restaurants for an experience you will not easily forget.,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JonathanHasen

La Mamounia Marrakech,nikolai69 wrote a review Apr 2016,50,VERY expensive - but unique - and beautiful,Stayed three nights- in one of the smaller rooms but facing the garden with a lovely balcony. Quiet and simply beautiful. Every detail in the property is pure perfection and well considered. And most of it very tastefully done (there are a few quite gawdy art-pieces in the central lobby areas that one could do with out - but the rest of the hotel is done with excellent taste). The restaurants are excellent (again very very expensive - think 70£ for a (albeit excellent) buffet lunch incl a drink at the pool-side restaurant). The gardens are the highlight - blossoming and very fragrant orange trees everywhere and a small army of gardeners to keep everything in perfect shape. A gym with top-notch facilities and again perfect service in a pavillion in the garden.  The pool spa and hammam are a must to experience.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Copenhagen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nikolai69

Unluckily it rained the whole time but thanks to the indoor pool and the overall facilities of the hotel we were not bored and enjoyed meals in two out of the three restaurants (we skipped the french which we already knew quite well).

La Mamounia Marrakech,kartwoman wrote a review Apr 2016,40,"Beautiful Renovation, Wonderful History",Mamounia was in renovations the last time I was in Marrakech and wow what a glorious job they have done preserving and upgrading this historically important property. Our Park Suite was gorgeous complete with nailhead trim vault-like doors an extra powder room (much appreciated) singing birds and balcony etc. The pool area was fantastic and the freestanding athletics complex was a major surprise - really impressive and darn I hadn't brought my runners! Parts reminded me of a fabulous Oberoi resort or the better Four Seasons/Aman properties but there is no comparing when it comes to Moroccan architecture. Just lovely. The Churchill bar is a must - great cocktails warm service. The only flaw we experienced really was with the concierge staff. Knowing the city fairly well I found one a bit green in terms of recommendations and the more seasoned gentlemen quite old-school dismissive and condescending toward my female companion (a female executive of some stature in the US) on three separate occasions. I realize that is partly cultural but it has no place in a hotel of this nature. The spa was okay - not the best not the worst a little disorganized.

A sensory feast. The views of the Atlas Mountains a treat. Traditional moroccan decor meets the world of modern standards and amenities. The indoor pool is the PRETTIEST you will ever see! The staff is very friendly and attentive.  The included breakfast is a vast spread. The garden with the orange trees in bloom simply dreamy.

The rooms are very beautiful (if they face the garden) but if I reserve some special suites I do not want any upgrades because again they have messed up their reservations. It would be acceptable if they tell you the truth at least but they always make it look like they do you a favour.  Service is not 5 star standard at all I would send all staff to Thailand for training. Water is never replaced in the suites or rooms not in th evening not in the daytime telephones have no numbers written on them so you have to guess what to dial for the reception or other services TVs turn on in the night but can not be turned off by the remote sorry but not for this price. There are to many very good Hotels in the City of Marrakesch to except this.  Another nuissance is the breakfast nothing is served except coffee waiters all look like nurses dressed in white and run around like hen in a farmground no elegance whatsoever noisy. Eggs Benedict are stored on the buffet so they are hard when you leave they chace you for a signature in a rather rood way.

La Mamounia Marrakech,TomrAtTA wrote a review Mar 2016,40,Be ready to pay over the odds; but remains a great experience.,"We (couple) booked a 3-night stay in Tigmiza Suites attracted by the beautiful-looking pools to get some early sunshine but Tigmiza advised they would be closed due to ""drainage problems"". We had stayed at La Mamounia though only for one night around 10 years ago & had a great experience so I ""played it safe"" & rebooked us into La Mamounia. Email requests to the hotel for transfer from the airport went unanswered. Our next disappointment washaving booked via Hotels.com we were told (after committing) ""An additional fee of MAD 391.62 (around £27) will be charged by the hotel""!!! La Mamounia remains spectacular; but the Art Deco style seems to have been lost in places during renovation. We paid extra for a Superior Room; but found the room rather cramped though the bathroom was good and tiling & plasterwork beautiful. Staff are efficient & very attentive; though we found one particular member of staff in the Italian Bar officious: his insistence upon where we sat could have become quite unpleasant. The French Restaurant was very good but expensive (£240 for two of us including £80 for a modest bottle of wine). Extras totalled £200/ day not including our French Restaurant meal. For example- 3 small bottles of beer plus a Club Sandwich came to £60 one day. Our experience of the nearby Bazaar was likewise a little disappointing- some bargains to be had; but any acknowledgement of a local is likely to suggest to them that you are in urgent need of a paid tour guide. You are probably better getting a professional guide from the hotel but if you do guard against ending up in a rather expensive rug shop (from our experience 10 years ago). Our 3 days provided around 3 hours bright sunshine around the pool with the rest of the time dull windy & rainy due we understood to the proximity of the Atlas Mountains so don't assume that the weather will necessarily be good this time of year (March). La Mamounia remains probably justifiably a 5* hotel but is rather over-priced compared to competitor hotels. The ride back to the airport was reputedly courtesy of one of 2 female taxi drivers in Marrakech and quite a pleasure.",Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bradford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TomrAtTA

We were welcomed in and said we just wanted tea and a few sandwiches outside and to look at the beautiful gardens. The hotel is amazing the gardens wonderful and all the superlatives in most of these reviews are correct. However we made the mistake of ordering only four tapas portions between the five of us as we weren't really hungry.    The waitress could not cope with this minor request it flustered her and her manners deserted her. Her smile visible at first turned sour she became haughty and arrogant and it gave her obvious pain to serve us. Upon reflection we should have asked for her name and informed the manager as I am sure this cannot be a feature of the training staff receive in this beautiful place. Moreover the glass water decanter was chipped and when this was pointed out there was no apology; it appeared to increase her disdain. We had to ask for extra cutlery extra bread when it was obvious to her we were sharing - not impressive. Not what we expected at all    All five of us are professionals we understand the prestige involved in keeping standards excellent but this was a most extraordinary experience. I am only sorry that we were waited on by this particular waitress. It spoilt the grandness and specialness of the location which is rich with history beauty culture and the most fabulous gardens.

We decided to report thus to the manager on the way out and his response was "" we have done 34 lunches today and no one has complained "" so that makes it ok ???? No wonder he'd only done 34 lunches  we would never step inside this hotel again and were disgusted when we left .

Massive old world hotel with incredible service and facilities. Looks beautiful too - they remodelled a few years ago and it's incredibly impressive all across the resort.    The service was as consistently good as I have ever experienced - they struck that beautiful balance of being immediately available without being overbearing.    Sitting on the spacious balcony of the room and looking out over the gardens after a day of wandering around the busy noisy city was like a slice of heaven. Similar experience by the massive pool too - palm trees swaying water lapping against the side. It's all so beautiful.    You're in great hands with the concierge desk too - they recommended a phenomenal guide to take us around the Souk and the driver that they arranged for an Atlas Mountains trip took us into a little Berber settlement for an insight into the life of those families which was probably the highlight of the trip.

La Mamounia Marrakech,gamemaven wrote a review Feb 2016,40,Bathroom Blunder,After reading all the marvelous reviews we were expecting perfection at La Mamounia. While many aspects of the hotel are lovely the bathroom in our room is outrageous. The toilet is in such a narrow alcove right inside the main door that you cannot close the door to it so when you use the toilet your knees are actually in the hallway that leads into the bedroom. It is inconceivable that a first class hotel considers this an acceptable design as the alcove is visible from the closet area and the sink across the hallway.  We had dinner at the French and Italian restaurants. Both were delicious with the best food we've had anywhere in Morocco. The food is expensive but coming from the New York area  we are not unaccustomed to hi priced meals. However we have never before paid 10 dollars for a bottle of water 32 dollars for a plate of pasta with red sauce - and nothing else on it or 30 dollars for a sandwich.,Date of stay: February 2016,,"Chefchaouen, Morocco",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gamemaven

La Mamounia Marrakech,Taz900 wrote a review Feb 2016,50,Amazed at how good it actually was,We visited Marrakech as part of a work reward trip and stayed 3 nights at La Mamounia as a group of 55. What an experience from start to finish. We were dropped off in the car park on the opposite side of the road (which is a dual carriageway) and when the policeman saw up approaching to cross very kindly stopped all lanes of traffic so we could cross safely. We were told to leave our bags in the coach (they had provided labels) and make our way into the hotel. The gates are guarded but they had obviously been told to expect us and we were ushered in with pomp and ceremony - into what I can only describe as a verdant green paradise garden - after walking through the gardens we came upon the hotel it was obviously a palace in the past and looked very sumptuous. We were again ushered in by more white clad staff who greeted us in French and offered honeyed milk and dates as well as hot towels in the foyer. Our passports were checked and we were given room keys in the form of a leather wallet with two room pass cards business cards for the hotel manager and business cards for various useful local services all included. We were then escorted to our room and shown all the facilities before being left alone. The bags had already been delivered to our rooms without any fuss. The rooms already had plenty of bottled water that was restocked twice a day and we found some lovely macaroons by the side of the bed and some fruit.  The breakfast was absolutely amazing by the pool the choice was literally endless and the staff were extremely attentive and polite. The evening meal in the restaurant was pleasant but nothing to write home about - I was a bit disappointed to be honest as it seemed to lack flavour but then I am used to spicy food and I think it had been toned down for western palettes. The bar was great live jazz music but very expensive drinks.  The gardens are lovely and the pool is great too. I have to give credit to the staff they were better than any other hotel I have ever come across - the client is king in their eyes. If a member of staff was walking towards us in a corridor they would press themselves against the wall bow their head and quietly say Bon Jour as we passed. Nothing was too much trouble and they were without exception polite and helpful and attentive.  It is a very expensive hotel indeed but you do get what you pay for in life and they make sure you are well looked after. I did glimpse a couple of celebrities staying there at the time. Top tip the corridors are dimly lit and quite dark keep this in mind if your eyesight is not the best (like mine) and perhaps be prepared with a torch on your phone.  I am definitely going back some day but will first save up a few thousand pounds so I can afford to stay a whole week. The most basic room (at the time we stayed there) was about £500 per night and that did not include breakfast that was about £35 per person. Overall I'd give this hotel more than 5 stars!,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Taz900

The positive points were:    Beautiful gardens  Amazing decor  The historical Churchill bar is very atmospheric.  Live jazz    The negative points were:  Lack of service on arrival.  Set menu in the Moroccan restaurant had very average food  The price was £80 per head for 2 courses (Not worth it).  I had lobster that was so salty over cooked and inedible.  No apology when we complained to the waiter.  Had to complain to the manager in the end...  He jus said that the lobster was his favourite dish and did not acknowledge that there was any problem. No offer of changing the dish or a discount.  We will never waist our money in here again.

The buffet breakfast is also GREAT they have pretty much everything you can think of including exotic fruits from around the world.  The hotel is huge!!! You really should take your time and take a walk around because it is absolutely GORGEOUS.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Preyal D wrote a review Jan 2016,50,Beautiful hotel with excellent service,Our stay got off to a rocky start (small misunderstanding regarding the winter escape package) however from the moment we were collected from the airport the staff have gone out of their way to provide the best service possible to ensure we enjoy our stay. (Last day today and sad to be leaving so soon!)    I've stayed in various really good hotels around the world a lot look stylish and luxurious from the outside but have no heart and soul with terrible impersonal service. La mamounia is incredibly impressive. The hotel itself is in the perfect location for the old and new town. The grounds are incredibly amazing the gardens are big and beautiful. The spa is excellent the treatments are very good and worthwhile. Great outdoor indoor pools & jacuzzi. There are two gyms with plenty of good equipment. Each member of staff with their great personalities and lovely willingness to just help makes this hotel what it is. If they make a mistake wrong order etc - they are quick and keen to make up for it. Just brilliant love it and it's how it should be given the prices.    I would highly recommend staying here. Check the view of your room and whether it has a balcony or not - the park suites don't have balconies but are very spacious. The Koutoubia deluxe rooms are very traditional beautiful decor but not very big. Each member of staff has gone out of their way to be flexible and accommodating of each of our requests. Nothing seems too hard or too much trouble which so great and had made the stay so much easier more comfortable and enjoyable.    The only thing I can fault the hotel on is that the turn down service hasn't left local delicacies each evening which was supposed to be included. I think I can live with that though given the level of service provided so far!

We enjoyed a fruit cocktail on the terrace overlooking the spectacular gardens. We should have stopped there. We then made the mistake of having the ""poolside buffet"". The food was ok but nothing great and not worth the very steep prices. There was a mix of seafood salads meats and desserts but definitely not 5 star standard. What was really poor was the service. Abrupt rude & demanding come to mind. When paying (which took 15 minutes) the waiter kept going on about his tip. He also insisted that our credit card transaction was in GP£ (despite usually having the choice of local or home currency).... no doubt this threw another 10% margin onto the hotel's profit line.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Joyce S wrote a review Jan 2016,50,Attractive gardens,After a hot dusty morning sight-seeing around the Medina of Marrakech we had an hour to spare before lunch at our own hotel and happened to be passing La Mamounia. We tentatively asked at the entrance of this sumptuous hotel whether non-residents were allowed to view the gardens. As my husband was wearing shorts and sandals (both definitely not the dress code here!) and I was not feeling at my chic and elegant best we did not hold high hopes of being admitted. Initially were politely refused. Then as we were turning away a sympathetic manager came out and signed us through. We passed through the magnificent central hall and out into the gardens to the rear of the building. We could probably have sat by the pool and ordered a coffee if we had wished but in the midst of such expensive looking elegance even around the pool we kept discretely in the back-ground and wandered round the largely deserted gardens. They are tastefully laid out and immaculately kept and we enjoyed the hour we spent there. But in spite of all the luxury we did wonder whether the super wealthy really did have such value for their expensive stay. The temperature was in the 30'sC and when sitting out in such lovely gardens sipping one's coffee it seemed something of an imposition to be expected to swelter in approved 'casual' wear such as designer jeans and bespoke shoes instead of feeling cooler in sandals and simpler clothing. We were happy to go back to our own 4star much more relaxed hotel where comfort did not need to take second place to fashion.,Date of stay: November 2015,,"Maidstone, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joyces137

The staff at the hotel made us feel welcome and safe. We were warmly greeted and offered the best dates and almond milk that I have ever had. We gorged ourselves at the brunch and relaxed poolside. We also really loved our room. We had a great view of the medina but was a touch noisy on Saturday evening until midnight or so. The quieter rooms face the garden in the back which was a welcome relief of truly fresh air after walking back from the markets in the old city. The beds were extremely comfortable and I really liked that the bedroom was tucked around the corner from entrance and behind two doors so it was very quiet and private from the hallway other guests and staff.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Adam H wrote a review Dec 2015,50,Limited review - GREAT BAR - Best in Marrakech,The Hotel Mamounia won best hotel of the year last year from Conde Naste. It is in wonderful location a wonderful hotel surrounded by a wonderful garden. And it is a place frequented as guests by world leaders top musicians actors celebrities or the very very very rich. In this location this restaurant fits like a smooth hand in a velvet glove.    La Mamounia has probably the very best collection of art deco furniture lighting — all things architectural - in the world. If you ever wanted to see the absolute beauty of art deco La Mamounia cannot be surpassed. The bar is an architectural thrill ride in ALL RESPECTS. Pure art deco beauty.    So you aren’t rich let’s say. You aren’t royalty or a movie star or a prized athlete - you aren’t a celebrity or crazy rich. (If you were you’d already be staying at this hotel.) For the price of 2 cocktails you CAN enjoy the quality of life that only a rare select less than 1% enjoy by going to the La Mamounia bar.    Please respect the experience. Don’t go in shorts and flip flops. Don’t try to obtain seating wearing a baseball cap (forward or backward.) Don’t go here acting like someone who has no manners or upbringing - because they won’t let you in — or will throw you out. This place is upscale and expects its patrons to be upscale (maybe rappers who make $100M/year can dress this way - but not you or I.)    By USA standards drinks here are not expensive. I regularly pay $20 for a martini in downtown Chicago or New York these days - and sometimes more. In just good places. For that same price you can have a cocktail in one of the most beautiful bars in the world. Whether you have it inside at the bar or at one of the very private tables in the bar area. Or in the beautiful garden outside.    Want to impress your beau or spouse? Want to rekindle some romance? I cannot imagine a better place than the bar at the La Mamounia. Been together a few years and grown a bit “accustomed to each other” then put on a nice shirt and jacket a bit of jewelry and take someone special to La Mamounia — they’ll know you think they are special the moment they enter this place. And maybe order a champagne cocktail or martini instead of a beer.    I’ve gone there 3 times. It is one of the very best bars in the world for people who have some class. Or aspire to having some class. You can almost pretend you’re Sean Connery having a cocktail with Sophia Loren here. I hope it never goes away.,,,"Las Vegas, Nevada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adamh540

In just 3.5 hours you arrive to this magical land of culture beauty sunshine and adventure and the friendliness and genuine warmth of the people make you feel so welcome from the moment you walk into the desert sunshine.  Over the years admittedly I have been really spoilt and stayed at many of the most highly rated hotels around the world so I have a very high bench mark and it really takes something extraordinary to impress me and most often I'm disappointed.  Without a doubt Hotel La Mamounia is in my opinion the BEST hotel in the world as the service level and attention to detail is so well thought I'm beyond impressed with the superior excellence that sets it far apart from the other 5* hotels I have stayed.......OUTSTANDING and world class  La Mamounia has something that is so special and unique its also the perfect getaway for winter sun rest and relaxation or actioned packed adventure  When I walked into my beautiful suite I was blown away by the exquisite and very tasteful interior design - such as the subtle motif on the heaters and handmade furnishing - every aspect and amenity really is executed to utter perfection and of the highest standards even down to the hair dryer which really worked unlike most hotels which scrimp on these details. Also the products are all very high quality and generous large bottles with the most exotic scents that smell divine.  I left my phone charge back in the UK and when I came back to the room after checking out the spar the butler had spotted this and put a charger in my room without me asking. I LOVE that and so many other service touches like champagne stoppers put so many hotels to shame as all the staff really do go above and beyond to ensure your stay is as relaxing and comfortable as possible.  Eventually I ventured to meet my friends in the hotel bar thinking Marrakesh would not have the standard of cocktails we expect in the best bars in London....I was wrong by a long way the barman produced the best margarita peach bilini and expresso martini I have ever tasted and everything down to the glassware was served with perfection and style.  Then dining in the restaurant is so magical and atmospheric it really is a very special experience and perfect for big celebrations but equally romantic as the setting is so enchanting and you feel transported to another world.....  Being there with a large party of great friends was also just fabulous as we had the private room which was dressed so beautifully it was honestly one of the memorable and enjoyable dinners of my life. The food was simply delicious I will be dreaming of that meal for a long time to come and the presentation was so chic and elegant it really is an unforgettable dining experience. The staff are so well trained and attentive its michelin stared quality but with a smile and charm that is lacking in so many fine dining restaurants. I also adored the musicians that rove around the tables and really add something authentic and uplifting to the ambiance - its so beautiful and elegant that you can't help feeling that this is more then just a hotel as it really goes above and beyond to create the most special personal experience for each and every guest. I came away feeling that the staff genuinely care and really take a lot of pride in the level of service as its honestly the best I have ever experienced. Very impressed.  I also particularly loved the lighting as its very subtle and flattering and everywhere  you go there is the scent of the most heavily scented candles that are so divine I picked some up from the gift shop to take home.  For a special occasions major celebrations romantic getaways or private time with family and friends in one of the villas - there is nowhere I would recommend more then Le Mamounia as it was such a sublime stay as it encompasses all the senses you come away totally revitalised and energised from such a wonderful holiday.  Its just off the chart on every level and I'm already planning my 40th there as there is nowhere else in the world I would rather be :-),Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/109fleurc

After spending the day exploring the colorful hectic  noisy exciting souks & winding narrow streets inside the Ancient City Walls my husband & I welcomed the quiet peaceful tranquil surroundings of this beautiful former Royal Palace. We enjoyed a lovely afternoon High Tea in the lower gardens sipping our Moroccan Mint Tea nibbling on French Macaron & other dainty fare. Later we walked along the pathways admiring the many varieties of fruit trees flowers kittens & listening to the pleasant sound of birds singing !! There is a large well kept vegetable garden in the lower end of the property - used by the hotel restaurant Chefs . Please be advised that even though there is no charge to enter theLa Mamounia - there is a dress code - so no thongs & sloppy shorts & T-shirts !

The garden is astoundingly large and we wish we had more time to explore as we were short on time and underestimated its scope. The pools are heated – which makes it accessible during the evening hours as well both indoor and outdoor.

We purchased a pass (1600 MAD pp) which allowed spa and pool entry one spa treatment and lunch. This was excellent value!  The Hotel is beautiful both inside and out. We lazed by the pool for a couple of hours and even swam at the end of November! We then had our 3 course lunch at the Italian restaurant. Food was very good great portion sizes for lunch. We had an excellent lobster starter sea bass main course and 2 puddings the tiramisu (OK) and an excellent pear tart!  Then we had our treatments my husband had a very relaxing massage and I had the hammam. The Hammam was superb so different to previous Turkish experiences! The spa rooms are beautiful.

We stayed in a ""premier room"" and it was more of a suite than just a room. The attention to details in the carving the plasterwork the mosaics and all the fabrics was just beautiful. Service was very good throughout the hotel. We had several meals at the different restaurants and they were all superlative. We didn't spend too much time at the outdoor pool but it looked wonderful. The indoor pool and hottub were gorgeous. We really felt like we were in a palace! The expansive gardens including the on-premises kitchen garden were probably our favorite part.

However the service at the bar and restaurants are not the best. You wait way too long to be served and trying to catch someone's eye for the the bill is quite difficult.

La Mamounia Marrakech,TravellinGal50 wrote a review Nov 2015,40,Dinner here was pricey but worth the experience,We had decided to visit the famous hotel for a drink. We were immediately impressed w the monumental beauty of this former palace. We visited the Winston Churchill Bar but decided that the smoky tiny bar historical as it is was not the place for us. So we went to the main bar which is right off the main lobby. We had such a good time having a drink that we decided to stay for dinner which they served us right there in our comfy velvet armchairs. It was a limited bar menu but there were more than enough choices for the four of us. The food was average as was the service which I would even rate as subpar. But it was delightful to be in such a well known place with all sorts of people passing by. The people watching and exploring the huge lobby afterwards was worth being overcharged at the bar.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Boston, Massachusetts",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellinGal50

La Mamounia Marrakech,Karen E wrote a review Nov 2015,50,How to be like Lifestyles of the RIch and Famous for under $50,After my experience on Jemaa el Fna (a whole other story-see that review) I was ready for something to calm me down and bring me back to a sense of familiar civilization-enter La Mamounia. From the moment you enter the well-manicured gardens you know you have entered the Beverly Hills Hotel of Marrakech. The architecture of the buildings the doormen and the beautiful gardens surrounded by hip and trendy french dog sculptures was like entering another world from the hustle and bustle outside its gates. Not being able to afford a night's stay in such luxury (I am an AirBnB person) we decided to see how the 1% live by having a drink in the outdoor patio area. What an oasis! Beautiful lounge chairs comforted us as we perused the drink menu. I had the Manhattan-it was smooth and mellow with just the right kick that you would expect from a Manhattan. Obviously they only use the best quality of rye whiskey! I was offered little dishes of almonds and olives. The price tag for my Manhattan? A steep 190 dirham-the equivalent of $19 USD. Not the end of the world but a far cry from the $8-10 I pay in the finest of drinking holes in America-but it was so worth it! For the price of $19 I got to pretend that I was famous or royalty.  After my cocktail break I found myself window-shopping at the little jewelry store near the entrance of La Mamounia. I thought anything they were selling would be out of my price range but I was pleasantly surprised. I scored an awesome ring with beautiful quartz stones for under $100 USD-and just the sight of it right now on my finger takes me back to the city I love Marrakech and the beauty of La Mamounia.

La Mamounia Marrakech,brontyman wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Five Star Hotel Located In The Medina Of Marrakech,This is a hotel in the style of the grand hotels of days past. The service is first rate fast and attentive and the public areas opulent and rich. Located in the walled medina of Marrakech you get the feeling you are stepping back in time. If there is a criticism of the hotel is that it is dark. While that keeps it an air of mystery and yes romance it becomes an issue when you're trying to locate something in the room or the corridors. The location of the hotel allows for easy access to the shops and sights of Marrakech but be forewarned crossing the street is not the same as the pedestrian friendly United States.,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Huntington Beach, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brontyman

La Mamounia Marrakech,Adam C wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Worth a visit,My girlfriend and I visited La Mamounia during our stay in Marrakech. We did not stay in the hotel but as the pool in our hotel wasn't good we ended up buying a day pass (£35 per person per day) two days running to use the pool.    I cannot therefore review the rooms but we did see a lot of the other facilities.    Firstly the hotel has two pools one indoor and one outdoor. It's a nice touch having the indoor pool for the cloudy or rainy days. The outdoor pool is huge and was where we spent two lovely afternoons. The service by the pool is excellent the staff are very friendly and always on hand to bring drinks or food.    The food by the pool was very nice even if the menu was somewhat limited. The buffet is in a restaurant at the side of the pool also but that was rather pricey at £50 p/person or £80 for the brunch on a Sunday. The basic pool snack menu was still not cheap (£20 for a burger and chips £4 for a can of coke) but I guess seemed reasonable in comparison.    After our sunbathing session we had a wonder round the gardens of the hotel and discovered a fantastic feature. The hotel grows the majority of its own fruit veg and herbs. There is an orange grove where the oranges are picked olive trees surrounding the paths and an allotment at the bottom with all the herbs and vegetables. We even saw one of the chefs going round on his golf cart picking the herbs for that evening. Some of the suppliers in Marrakech (in the souks) look a bit suspect so it was very comforting to know so much was grown on site.    There are tennis courts and a gym which looked fairly well kitted out for cardio or machine work although no free weights. We saw the gym in the grounds I believe there is another in the main hotel.    All in all the hotel is amazing. Yes it's very expensive but we definitely wished we'd stayed there.,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adamcla
La Mamounia Marrakech,TravelAgentAbroad wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Wonderful Hotel but cost of drinks and food is a rip off.,I can see why this hotel has been voted best hotel in the world it is a wonderful oasis of calm in the middle of a mad city.  Hotel grounds swimming pool and public areas are wonderful. Staff are attentive without being in your face and breakfast was very good.  However I do think the hotel needs to take a long hard look at the prices they are charging in their bar and restaurants. They are eye watering and a complete rip off.  £9 for a small local bottle of beer and £7.50 for a can of Coke I fail to see how they can justify these prices. Moroccan restaurant was £70 a head for two courses food was mediocre at best add in the of the drinks and we felt ripped off. Italian was more resonable but still paid £25 a head of main meal plus ridiculous cost of drinks food was at least nicer here.  Had drink costs been more resonable we would have loved nothing more than heading back to hotel for drinks in the bar after a hot and hectic day in the souks or a couple if night caps in the bar each night. It appears we were not the only ones who refused to be ripped off as there were very few people in the bar area as a result the hotel lack atmosphere.,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelAgentAbroad

Extremely expensive they try to be a Palace but so many thing are wrong.  Definately the best place in Marrakech with the position and the beautiful gardens.    Food is ok and not at the level of the price(£100 for brunch at the pool with no wine £120 a head at the Italian)  The check-in take for ages even with sending all information by email to save time 35 to 40 min!  Last October I had a room on 2nd floor and was paying for a pool view with many trees infront so this time I did ask to be higher but nothing happened when I arrived and still was on 2ns floor. Do they have a front desk manager to look after clients coming back??    Room had always something missing and in 5 days I never had a free botle of water next to my bed for turn down service unbelievable for an hotel that level!  Also one day the room was not made at 15h45 and I had to call the reception to send someone.    Positive thing are the free wifi working well and very good matress in the room.

The room was beautifully furnished and had the added bonus of electric shutters meaning undisturbed sleep. I haven't felt quite as revived in years! Pool area is lovely snack/bar menu good. The gym situated in the gardens is well equipped and much nicer than the one in the Spa. We ate one night in the Italian which was lovely but we found the hotel quite lacking in atmosphere and quiet at night so headed out to other Riad's for Dinner and Drinks. This hotel is definitely not for everyone but we found it a perfect place to retreat after a crazy day in The Medina and Souk's.  Other points to note wifi was poor for a hotel of this quality.,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lottsclarke
La Mamounia Marrakech,Sheila J wrote a review Oct 2015,50,L'Italien. Perfecto.,My girlfriend really wanted to visit but after reading the reviews of the hotel's restaurants I decided not to go. The reviews were either really good or bad and I did not want to take a chance. Luckily we went. We chose the Italian restaurant on the terrace. It is so beautiful and elegant. The service is what one expects from such a classic hotel. I highly recommend that you dress up a little and make a reservation. Yes the prices are a little higher but take into consideration where you are. Think opulent.  I started with the garden salad with goat's milk cheese so beautifully plated and heavenly delicious. My main was the fresh tagliolini with garlic oil and peppers. It is not prepared classically but has been totally re-invented using the little green Moroccan peppers. Literally the Best Pasta I have ever had in my entire life.  I just hope that when you go it is as good as when I was there because it was divine.,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Moscow, Russia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/35sheilaj
La Mamounia Marrakech,superjk10 wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Lovely pool and surroundings,Called off here one day for a break from the Medina hustle and bustle. It was about £33 per person to stay for the afternoon by the pool including lounger use of the spa facilities and free ice cream. May seem steep to some but well worth a little break to clear the mind. We went with two other couples and all six of us napped at one point - it was so peaceful. Service was good and wi-fi free for 4 hours. The pool was a lovely temperature.

La Mamounia Marrakech,JONUK13 wrote a review Oct 2015,40,Great hotel: avoid at all costs the Italian Bar,We stayed 5 nights here booked through AMEX. Overall we were really pleased with our stay and we thought the hotel was a great place: beautifully designed and very relaxing. Two gyms an excellent spa three restaurants to choose from and beautiful grounds. There was just one downside which is a significant one. The service in the Italian bar was consistently very poor indeed – in stark contrast with the excellent service that we received everywhere else – from the concierge the pool boys the Churchill Bar the Moroccan and French restaurants.  First we went there for lunch and the waitress was rude and offhand.  Second we went for a drink there and waited 30 minutes for our order to be taken (and it was only taken after two separate occasions when one of us stood up and went to the desk and asked to be served)  Third we were shown to a table for lunch where we sat down only to be told abruptly that we could not sit there as it was reserved. No alternative offered nor any apology for the mistake. We asked whether we could sit at another table nearby and were told “Yes I suppose so”. The table remained empty for the whole of the lunch.  It is as though the Italian Bar is run by an entirely separate organisation - it is so different from the rest of the hotel. It is a problem that really needs to be sorted.  I hope it is as the rest of the hotel is excellent.,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Broadway, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JONUK13

Breakfast is a buffet and costs approx £27 per person. The staff here were really good and attentive easy to talk to and well presented (apart from one who had white Nike trainers on!) The food was good 5 stations one of juices and drinks one of traditional English breakfast items one of pastries one of fruits and one of cheeses and seafood. The quality of the food did not seem any better than other places we have eaten unless you ask the chef to cook something up. We had fresh French toast and eggs benedict which we were both great but nothing extraordinary. The pastries were cold and the water melon did not taste fresh. I must add that once I had ordered the eggs benedict I was waiting for approx 15mins before it arrived.    Overall breakfast was good would I pay that much again for that breakfast?

La Mamounia Marrakech,speaktojulie wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Perfect for a couples getaway,We loved this hotel staying for 3 nights out of our 5 in Marrakech. The previous reviews say it all really fantastic location in the centre of the city an oasis within the city glamorous and sophisticated.    Highlights were the breakfast (one of the best we've experienced globally) but particularly the level of service which I would say is out of this world. The pool service is also excellentdiscreet but attentive and worth mentioning. Another highlight was the area around and outside the Churchill bar which has been commented on. It is fabulous for a cocktail and a bit of people watching...a few very strange and bespoke fashion choices there!! A relaxing way to spend the sunset hours with great cocktails and appetisers. If you stay here you must go to the Moroccan restaurant in the courtyard at this hotel; some of the best food we had on our trip. Pricey but well worth it...gorgeous setting and authentic delicious food - we went twice!!    The hotel has been renovated but I think it's style is a little confused; great photographs around the hotel but the hotel has neither a colonial or an authentic local identity. A weird mix really! Just my thoughts...    My only criticism of this hotel would be the bathrooms they are so dark!! The lights inside the rooms are also dim and whilst romantic this is frustrating when you actually need to be able to see what you are doing!! Please provide dimmers or more lamps!!!    If you are debating this hotel or a riad I would say choose this hotel if a larger pool and choices are important to you. We really appreciated the space greenery and relaxation to be found here after the craziness of the medina and souks. Yes it is a hotel and not a traditional riad but you quickly 'get' Marrakech and I didn't leave thinking we had missed out on a riad experience.

Each day something was left in our room chocolates fruit a bottle of wine…. nice extras. The bars were superb  the Churchill bar was very cool but a little to smoky for us. But very good ambiance. We preferred the bar next to the italian restaurant beautiful setting and lovely cocktails. The italian restaurant was sooooo good the first night truffle pasta burratta etc… we decided to eat there again.. a little disappointed the second time. The french resurant was good but not great. The breakfast buffet was one of the best we have experienced as well as the lunch buffet. The hotel was filled with many people from France but was still very international in its feeling. The spa was underground and very dramatic with very good massages I also used the hair salon several times which I found to be very upscale.

The service was professional and prompt and the wine suggested was very good(at £50 per bottle it should be). The foodwhilst perfectly cooked was dull with little flavour. We both had different tagineswhich were equally bland.  Paying by credit card I was given the usual machine to put my pin number into which did not show the transaction value. Expecting to be paying in Dirhams and in a first class establishment I did not question this. I was surprised to then get a receipt that told me I had paid in UK £ and also that the hotel was getting a 3% mark up on my transaction and that the exchange rate was poor plus the hotel had ticked a box that precluded me from using the Mastercard exchange rate process etc. I always pay in local currency as this gives the best exchange rate.  Interestingly the Four Seasons  where we stayed for 10 days automatically charges in local currency without adding their own margin onto the transaction.,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/morleysonhols

La Mamounia Marrakech,sylvain7 wrote a review Sep 2015,50,out of this world,This hotel combines old (may I even say: colonial) style with all modern amenities. No wonder it was one of the favorite places of Winston Churchill. The hotel oozes charm sophistication deep-rooted oriental service all in a setting of a 1001 nights. The hotel having been totally renovated is extremely well maintained with a spectacular hall and bar. The garden is what makes this hotel famous and deservedly so: it is huge with beautiful flowers and trees a lovely terrace and two tennis courts. The hotel has three restaurants: Moroccan French and Italian all excellent. The swimming pool well separated from terrace and garden is also enormous without being intimidating. It is pleasant and beautifully laid out. Breakfast is next to the pool of an excellent quality and with a very sumptuous buffet. Service is quick and efficient. Most if not all the rooms have a balcony overlooking the city and in fact the hotel is smack in the middle of town for those who are interested in venturing out. The rooms are beautifully decorated in Moorish style a bit dark maybe with very large bathroom and huge separate showers. The balconies are large and - as said - with great views. There are two gyms both well-equipped one in the hotel which I prefer and one close to the tennis court much larger but it had an unpleasant smell. This is one of these hotels worth visiting just for its own merit.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Jazzygez wrote a review Sep 2015,10,5* hotel 0* service,What a beautiful hotel and some good staff but majority of staff look good but cannot deliver we arrived to get a table for dinner in the restaurant at 9.10pm walked past the Italian and manager said will send menus to us to have a drink outside at 9.25pm still no drinks order and no menus so my 10year old daughter went to ask for a drinks order to be taken and 10 mins later still no menus and still no drinks. There were at least 10 staff around looking pretty but no one actually doing anything. At this stage we decided we had enough and we're leaving at 860dirhams for a round of drinks which we hadn't received.  I expressed my comments on reception and Mr Taoufic ensured me that he will take care of things and please come back with him so we did he took care of the service got us our drinks and we we to to the restaurant to eat at which it was now after 10pm    Staff in restaurant were good but food wasn't wonderful lamb dish with couscous was ok but very fatty and salty and I mentioned this to the staff.    I asked for the bill and I said that is it normal for a round of drinks 860dirhams which took in the end nearly 30 mins to be charged and the waiter said normally should be 5 mins for drinks and you should not be charged for this and he would ask the duty manager Mr Taoufic about this 15 mins later he came back to say he will have to charge as Mr Taoufic had gone home. I then spoke to the night manager who didn't know what I was talking about. As you see Mr general manager your service is appalling and communications zero. I would not have come into your hotel expecting something for nothing but for dinner at nearly 4000dirhams would have expected some sort of service and etiquette from your staff. The night before we went to the Sofitel SO LOUNGE and the staff and food and ambience was fantastic and next time we will definitely go back there. Maybe that's why they were nearly full at 11pm and you had more staff than customers. I suggest you contact the General manager at the Sofitel so you and your staff take some lessons in hotel customer service I have their number if you need it.,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Petersfield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jazzygez

La Mamounia Marrakech,Annie L wrote a review Aug 2015,50,Possibly the best hotel I've ever stayed at,"La Mamounia is THE example of what a 5-star hotel is and should be. We stayed 3 nights here during our 4 day stint in Marrakech which was the final stop of our 3 week honeymoon.    First of all you don't wait in line to check in. They come to you. You are seated in a comfy area while the staff checks you in separately. Then a personal service agent greeted us with freshly made almond milk with a scent of orange blossom along with a side of dates. We gobbled them down so quickly they brought us another glass and tray. Kind of embarrassing on our part very thoughtful on their part!    Once you're checked in the bags are sent to your room while they give you a tour of the hotel. It was fun learning the history of La Mamounia along with tidbits of Marrakech. We stayed in the Deluxe Koutoubia Room which comes with a direct view of the Koutoubia Mosque. You can clearly hear the prayers and view the sunrise. It was so peaceful.    The beds are incredibly comfortable and the location is excellent (just a 10 minute walk to Jemaa El-Fna via Koutoubia Mosque). We enjoyed the pool spa services and dinner at Le Marocain. The pool is huge and the chairs are possibly the most comfortable ones I've ever experienced at a resort.    The spa is a unique experience—it's different from the US (not in a bad way) so I'd recommend going in with an open mind. The massages are relaxing overall vs. muscle focused (and the oils they use leave you soft and supple) while the ""hammam"" helps to exfoliate and shed your dead skin. Be prepared to go nude (it's the traditional way) but if you really feel uncomfortable you could go in your swimsuit.    Dinner at Le Marocain was very tasty. The food was the best we had in all of our time at Marrakech. However there were just a couple of things that threw us off. I couldn't finish my dinner so I asked to take it to-go and eat it in my room. The waiter immediately said no until another staff member returned and asked for my room number. That was odd—to have one person say no but another say yes. Then the next morning my husband woke up with the worst food poisoning. I was fine but we had different plates.    Overall we enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to others. My friends who've traveled to Marrakech advised staying in a riad but I cannot imagine not staying at La Mamounia when we return. The attention to detail and service is impeccable or shall I say even magical. Thank you La Mamounia for making our honeymoon a memorable one!    Protip: Beware of cabs at the airport. Once they know where you're staying you will be charged 200-250 dirhams or maybe even more. 125-150 dirhams should be a fair price as the hotel is located fairly close to the airport.

This hotel is surely the winner of the winners!! I loved it. It is simply the most brilliant hotel I have been to. Mostly Ive been caught by the interior of the venue. Its style is very intriguing because although the history of this place embraces you in such way that you feel the heavy Moroccan oriental style which illustrates the local culture simultaneously you are mesmerised by a great modernism and chic.    Hmm yes I was not really happy with the service coz unfortunately we are spoiled after experiencing great american service but honestly when I stayed there for a while I realised the service in the hotel is actually great comparing it to other hotels or local restaurants.

The grounds are beautiful and the hotel facilities excellent. I do believe that the price of drinks and food is a little on the high side even for such a nice place though. We were also dissapointed to find out that Churchills bar was closed for renovations when we visited.,Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Banstead, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E3267JLkarenc

La Mamounia Marrakech,leahmalka wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Business with pleasure,"This was my second visit to La Mamounia and we left enchanted!  The property is magnificent. The journey begins as you walk through the lobby and experience a beautiful aromatherapy that set our mood for ""Relaxation"". The corridor walls on every floor are adorned with black & white photographs of typical Moroccan life and it's rich culture. Our room was perfect modern yet rich with Moroccan tradition. The beds were amazing ..We came back to our room daily to find replenished water & fresh fruits. We just spent 2 weeks in Italy & Spain where eating was a big part of our experience. We agreed La Mamounia offered the best breakfast with the most beautiful setting by the pool!! We enjoyed the pool and it's very friendly staff.. For 4 days we enjoyed excellent service accompanied by a friendly smile.  We dined at Le Marocain restaurant.. The food ambiance and service were excellent. Our visit to Marrakech was during low season. Days peaked at 42... Lounging by the stunning pool was our favourite option.. Another bonus was the Resorts location .. Only a 10 minute walk from the bustling Marrakech Medina .. We enjoyed visiting Djemma el Fna where you are accosted with rows of food stalls wonderful colourful shops of shoes fabrics and ceramics also brightened the way... Our hotel became our sanctuary  The hotel management & staff were very professional and went out of their way to make our stay magical ..looking forward to our next trip back",Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Montreal, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leahmalka

La Mamounia Marrakech,PhineasfoggEngland wrote a review Jul 2015,50,An oasis in the desert.............,My colleagues and I were in Marrakesh on a business trip. As Hoteliers we were participating in the PURE conference and actually representing our own properties one in Africa and one in the Caribbean.  La Mamounia is well known and generally looked upon as one of the best Hotels in Morocco if not further afield. Currently owned by the King of Morocco it has been in existence since 1928. Following an extensive renovation that took several years to complete it has re-opened and apparently has been well received by most.    Our group spent five nights in Marrakesh on what turned out to be a very busy schedule for all of us . Although this resulted in very little time to sightsee we did get to enjoy all of what La Mamounia had to offer.    The hotel has three very good restaurants. One French one Italian as you might expect one that served Moroccan food.  As our group comprised mostly Europeans we frequented the French restaurant mostly. Excellent food  competent discreet service and a good cellar.  Breakfast was served by the Pool which is in a wonderful location surrounded by the extensive and beautiful gardens that are so much a part of the Hotel. The breakfast offerings were comprehensive and served promptly which is always a blessing when you are on a tight schedule. A wonderful way to start any day.    Our rooms were comfortable and certainly large enough for single occupancy as required on this trip. Tastefully tiled bathrooms in Moroccan style comfortable beds and all the amenities you would expect from a top rated hotel. I used the laundry service on a daily basis and the system worked beautifully.  I was awoken on most mornings at 5a.m. by the Mullah calling everybody to prayer. Most would consider this an intrusion or nuisance I found it rather magical and hypnotic. Perhaps that's the whole point.  Wherever I've travelled in the World I've tried to reserve some time for visits to a spa of one sort or another. Mamounia without doubt has one of the best spas I have experienced anywhere in the world. The surroundings and ambience subdue all of the senses as soon as you enter this sanctum sanctorum. The attendants were accomplished in their craft and the whole experience was nothing short of a rejuvenation of the mind body and soul.    As with all hotels the real test is the efficiency friendliness and competence of the staff. Being a hotelier myself I am probably a little more critical than most travelers. However from the very first moment I entered La Mamounia it felt special . The staff were welcoming attentive and courteous. Even though I had never stayed there before it felt like I was returning home. That's what it's all about.,Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled on business,British Virgin Islands,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhineasfoggEngland
La Mamounia Marrakech,Annie O wrote a review Jul 2015,40,"Nice hotel, service needs improvement",This is a very nice hotel in a good location. The rooms are of good size and there are some lovely staff there. The restaurants are very good. The spa has impressive amenities.    The standard of hotel services are in need of major improvement. Evening turn-down service was often inconsistent and had to be requested. Water was not consistently placed in the room; a big let-down in a 5 star hotel in a hot climate. The room service experience was also disappointing as they charge for any extra condiments and also to bring food to the room. Pool service was also slow. I also recall that on a number of days items in the breakfast buffet would be covered in a large number of wasps making the item unavailable for consumption.    Great hotel severely let down by the inconsistent standard in services.,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnieO844

La Mamounia Marrakech,JASON B wrote a review Jul 2015,40,"Quality, but at a price","The ""Grande Dame"" of Marrakech is certainly impressive. Huge gardens a property that was closed for 3 years to refurbish to the highest standard lots of attentive staff amazing food posh shops for customers with money to burn and a sniffy clientelle.    All this can be yours. The hotel is world famous Winston Churchill stayed here as well as anyone else famous who has visited this area. And why not? The position is fabulous and the hotel will provide you with as much luxury as you can throw money at.    However and this may not be a problem for you but was for me..like many other similar hotels Villa Deste in Commo Sandy Lane in Barbados the hotel has a formal stuffy air no doubt due to the type of people that frequent it.

La Mamounia Marrakech,AbsolutelyNoBorders wrote a review Jul 2015,40,"Opulent, if you like that sort of thing...",It's hard to say a bad word about this place. Every detail is opulently realized and the quality is of the highest degree. The rooms the service and the pool and gardens are all wonderful and you really do get what you pay for with a hotel like this.    Having said that you really will pay for this one. A meal at the restaurants will run you $200+ (similar food just outside the hotel walls runs no more than $100 often significantly less) and a drink at the pool is a casual $19 (before tip and tax). This is the sort of place you stay at because it is outrageously luxurious and you expect to pay for that privilege.    We enjoyed the opulence for a while and then took our leave and got drinks (for about $2 each) and a delicious and abundant dinner (for a total of $36 including tip and tax) just a few blocks away and then returned to our room for a very comfortable night's sleep.,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Long Island City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AbsolutelyNoBorders

There are faults and I have to be fair with service and the like. But it really is a delight to stay there. I have read other people's reviews and I do agree with the good and the bad. It could also be construed that my opinion is not somewhat fair especially being a 'VIP' guest of this hotel and of course it follows the service for myself has always been perfect because most of the Staff from the top down all know me.

La Mamounia Marrakech,shee_anthony wrote a review Jul 2015,40,Almost there,We spent three nights here and have mixed feelings about our stay. Airport pickup smooth and easy but lacked water in the car on arrival. Check in very smooth and friendly and very nice size room overlooking the pool. The lighting in the room is a capital indeed. The bathroom is at best average lit and the toilet is as dark as a cave. Some serious change needed here. This is not about ambience its a hazard. Housekeeping needs to be consistent. Complimentary water provided unevenly used glasses not changed at all and turndown service had to be requested for and towels not replaced.  The pool is a great place to relax although slightly over furnished and the ice cream bar at 4.30 is very nice touch. The service there is exemplary. Dinner at the Moroccan restaurant was a fantastic experience and the service lived up to the expectations one has.  The gardens are impeccable and well kept and a delight to see.

La Mamounia Marrakech,anna n wrote a review Jul 2015,30,Anna B.,I would like to share our 5 stars experience. The rooms are well maintained and give you unique oriental atmosphere. We've been the on our honey moon and were ready to spend some money but I can say that prices are in sane beyond any understanding and have no connection with the quality. It's not about gastronomic experience which cost certain money like Michlene stars restaurants. It's about to sell basic.. For example breakfast costs 38 euro per person BASIC buffet and with birds who are eating this buffet together with you surrounded by other flyes. We decided may be a la carte breakfast will have more sence.... Well omelette 15 euro BANANA 9 euro!!!! Orange salad 13 euro!!! Than time for the lunch... Italian restaurant near swimming pool ONLY buffet 70 euro!!! When it's heat +40 you don't wanna eat so much but no way to order just salad. they sent us to another Italian restaurant next to swimming pool we had a seat and afterward they inform us that there is a DRESS CODE!! And my husband has to change shorts into trousers!!!!!! At 13 o clock in the restaurant near pool with ratan furniture with plastic cover on the table!!!! We asked for a manager with a hope they say it's ok for the first time just keep in mind for the future but she said no we had to change and we left. The stupid thing that it's just a formality everybody were in the beach suits I was in transparent tunica with swimming suit under it. Some men were forced to change shorts and came in training pants.  So the summary is if you don't care about money or don't drink and eat in the hotel so it can be an option. Otherwise it's madness there are a lot of 5 stars hotels with half less price.,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Moscow, Russia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annan58

La Mamounia Marrakech,Simon J wrote a review Jun 2015,50,An oasis beyond the souks...,When you're ready to step away from the souks the haggling the heat - La Mamounia is your oasis.    We took the day pass (500 dh / £32) for access to the pool and gardens. The pool and spa pass (1400 dh / £90) includes one treatment and lunch. Beverages and food are five star priced - so if you baulk at the thought of paying £8 for a beer this might not be the place for you. £4.50 will get you an Iced Tea. Take your own bottled water...    As we visited during Ramadan the place was peaceful tranquil and the perfect antidote to the still bustling Medina.    The waiters were attentive friendly and settling our bill at the end of the day was not an issue. Highly recommend the incredibly fresh and well presented Tuna Niçoise (see photo).

We started our visit with lunch on the terrace. The service was slow and we had to make an effort to get noticed at all. We ordered a tuna salad a veggie panini a cappuccino and a gin and tonic which cost almost £75!  At the pool we ordered a bottle of water and the waiter wanted the bill settled immediately. We protested that we were not leaving and so would pay later. He was clearly unhappy with that.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Anthony-Susan wrote a review Jun 2015,30,"Luxury, but I would recommend visiting rather than staying here",La Mamounia has a strong history as Marrakesh's premier hotel. The gardens are indeed worth visiting but I find that the huge rehab of the hotel five years ago modernized it to the point that it lost so much of its former character. The rooms quite frankly are awkward to get about and we were not that comfortable.    In short for the cost it's definitely not a best value hotel but if you simply want to say that you stayed at La Mamouniya I guess that's worth paying the premium.

Perfectly located close to the old and new city the hotel itself is stunning with great architecture wonderful gardens and first class restaurants.    Whilst the rooms are bijou the amenities are first class.    We eat at all four restaurants in the hotel breakfast was an aladdins cave and beautifully presented with comfortable seating around an impressive 25m X 25m pool for guests.    In the evening we first eat at the Morrocan which is situated in the garden of the hotel and as an outdoor location is wonderful. The French and Italian restaurants followed on consecutive evenings and I have to say served up Michelin star standards on all occasions.    We booked a day trip to the Atlas Mountains through the Hotel which was first class the contrast between the 100F + heat of Marrackech and the stunning snow capped tranquil mountains was lovely.    If I had any criticism it would be that this is not a cheap hotel I came away with the impression that bar prices and wine were uncessarily steep whilst food for its quality was well priced.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Inspire316729 wrote a review Jun 2015,30,Day pass and lunch,My friend and I who are staying in a beautiful riad in the Medina decided to visit this famous beautiful hotel for the day. It cost around £60 each for the privilege of a day pass and before taking to our sunbeds around the pool we had lunch on the terrace. I had a g&t and salad nicoise my friend a coffee and club sandwich. This came to a jaw dropping equivalent of around £75!  One would think that as we had spent quite a lot for the 'honour ' of patronising their hotel we would be treated well. Maybe because we have been incredibly spoilt by the staff at Riad Dar Anika we actually felt quite unwanted and unwelcomed. We ordered a large bottle of water costing 7O dirham and a small beer costing 110 dirham and on both occasions a waiter came over to ask for payment prior to us leaving which came across as really quite rude.  Yes it is beautiful but I for one would not bother returning even if I could afford to stay there!

The check in was terrible I waited for 1.5 hours and it wasn't communicated to us that there would be this long wait hence a waste of our time.    The bar and food were exceptional and worth every penny. If you are gluten free then you will have no issues at La Mamounia as they will look after your every need and are clued up on gluten free.    The rooms are nice we had a standard room (it was all that was available on late notice) and it was lovely however the bathroom was very tight and you couldn't shut the toilet door as there wasnt enough leg room.    After the check in incident we did find that the service was exceptional everywhere else within the hotel.

Arrived at the airport with a very helpful man who met us carried our bags and led us to the car. Offered us bottles of water and took us to the hotel.    Looked around the amazing gardens whilst having a little tour with Mohammad who told us lots about the hotel. He showed us to our room which was lovely ever so slightly a squeeze in the twin bed rooms. But still amazing.    Had a beautiful lunch and then lounged round the pool. Dinner in the evening in the Moroccan was probably our best night amazing entertainment and amazing food and service.    2nd night we ate out.    3rd night we had the Italian the food was absolutely lovely although we waited 10 minutes for a menu once we ordered our wine we got our first glass poured for us and that was it. We had to pour our own wine the whole night. Service was very poor in this restaurant plates wasn't cleared very quickly even managers was serving our night had been ruined a bit however the food was amazing!    4day we had ordered some food round the lovely setting of the pool and all of a sudden building work started in the buffet restaurant right next door to the pool this was not pleasant so we had to go to our room and when we contacted management they notified us there had been no building work on the hotel for years since the renervation. When in actual fact the whole pool noticed this noise management then went down there and reassured us the noise had stopped by now we was already in our room. Management had offered to put us some wine in our room as a sorry. But we don't drink in the room so it got left.    Upon checkout as we went to pay our bill reception told us we hadn't paid for our private transfer so we had to pay for that they wouldn't accept our word and paper work it had been paid for. When we arrived home we contacted our travel agent whom assured us we had paid it and she got in contact with the hotel. Again the manager was there a lady and wasn't very helpful with our situation. So we paid and left.    We felt like the pool staff wasn't most helpful unless you was tipping them. We actually like to tip on the last day so this was also a shame seeing them be so attentive to other guests who had obviously tipped upon arrival. On the last day we tipped and got a excellent service magazines two towels each good chairs etc.    The hotel itself is simply stunnin rooms are amazing.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Delinblack wrote a review May 2015,40,Well worth a visit,We visited the hotel while in Marrakech as it is in all the guide books as one of the top hotels in Morocco. It is an absolutely lovely hotel with fantastic gardens and you can sit in and enjoy a meal or a drink without being a resident. My wife and I spent a very nice couple of horse wandering in the gardens and enjoying some mint tea. The prices are what you would expect in a high end hotel and go along reasonably smartly dressed.,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Delinblack
La Mamounia Marrakech,Novelist wrote a review May 2015,30,Beautiful refurbishment but overpriced,There's much to love about La Mamounia the grand old lady of Marrakech hotels but I won't stay there again. The newly restored rooms are claustrophobically dark and many are ver the giant air vents on the road side the service is obsequious yet I was asked at least half a dozen times if I was staying at the hotel and the meals are astronomically priced. When a buffet breakfast manages to cost more than in the finest hotels in Japan you have to ask if you're getting value.  The gardens of course are delightful and there's a massive pool and plenty of spaces to relax in. Clientele divide into a/ well-heeled French who think Maroc is still a colony b/ rich young Brits reeking of entitlement and c/ business types.  It comes down to a matter of taste; for me too stuffy too impersonal too overpriced - but others may love it. The beds are wonderful but a chair is too low for its desk wi-fi is vague and there aren't enough plug sockets.

La Mamounia Marrakech,dishSewickley_Pa wrote a review May 2015,50,The BEST Hotel!,I first stayed here in 2000 at the end of a B&R trip and was knocked out by the hotel.  It still retained it's Art Deco décor and watercolors by Winston Churchill were hanging in the halls. Since then it has had a complete renovation. The small negatives first. A number of the quirky shops have been replaced by boring big names Dior etc. but many still remain with one of the kind finds. And overall the hotel feels dark; I'm told they hear that a lot. That said it is still a one of a kind experience gorgeous furnishings  throughout and a spectacular pool with a fabulous breakfast and lunch buffet. Ask for a room overlooking the pool. The staff is the best part particularly Jawad at the pool who literally offered me the djellaba from his back when I couldn't find the same one in the souk. And Rashid who insisted on giving me a personal tour of the indoor pool and spa. The Moroccan people could not have been nicer again on this trip.

The common spaces pool and gardens are lovely. The service at breakfast was outstanding and the concierge was beyond helpful. We also had wonderful service from the bellman who helped us negotiate a taxi (no easy task) on our last evening. There were some bumps during the check-in process (we waited for for 30 minutes in a plush waiting area before we got up to ask if anyone was coming to help us. We would have preferred to have spent those 30 minutes in our room settling in after a 18+ hour journey from California) and a rather unpleasant wake-up call at 6am when someone (a bellman?) opened the door to our room and entered. Definitely not something you'd expect at a hotel of this caliber. The spa is beautiful though our massage was just ok. Agree with the other reviewer regarding the shower; the rain head was lovely but without a door the entire bathroom floor was soaked. A small thing but worth mentioning.    If you want to be close to the medina you can't beat the location. If you want a more intimate experience look elsewhere.

La Mamounia Marrakech,PT5 wrote a review May 2015,50,"Beautiful hotel, excellent service",Stayed for three nights at La Mamounia. The decor ambience and staff are all excellent. The rooms are beautifully furnished and very comfortable. Staff are friendly and helpful often seeming to know what you want almost before you do. The pool area is well laid out with plenty of availability of sun loungers and an abundance of staff to help with anything you want. The grounds are a quiet oasis of calm. My only minor criticism would be that many of the public areas are a little too dark. It is expensive; very expensive but if you choose to stay here you expect that in advance. A recent review complained that some staff struggled with English. Our experience was the complete opposite. Every member of staff was fluent in both English and French and always approached us with a smile.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Michael01UK wrote a review May 2015,30,"Dark, inept service, pricey, but beautiful grounds","I wish there was a 2.5 star rating for ""barely average"". For the price (GBP700 per night) I expect service and some frills. Instead the restaurant service was slower than molasses on a hot summer day the cost of a nicoise salad with what looked like chunk light tuna was about GBP28 and amazingly there was absolutely no frills at the pool. A bottle of water was GBP8 when it should have been handed out for free to avoid dehydration. The rooms were incredibly dark and the lighting system was more confusing than a Nasa computer system. Our room smelled and was noisy and the bed was hard as a rock. As a guest in an international hotel I should be treated to service in my native tongue. English was not fluently spoken by all staff which is not the major issue but annoying as my French is largely inadequate. This is NOT 5 star quality.    A few positives: the grounds are beautiful the fitness centre whilst very hard to find is great (get your waters for free there and take them to the pool!!) and the front desk is amenable to arranging tours and catering to various and sundry needs with pleasant efficiency. The location is a 10 minute easy walk to the Jemma al Fna so location is great.

We hoped things would improve with lunch but unfortunately not.The attitude and service of the staff was appalling and the Club sandwiches we ordered were very average and over priced even allowing for the venue.  We were smartly attired for the occasion so if it means the hotel does not want casual lunch guests perhaps it should be honest and say so. A very marked contrast to our lunch at Richard Branson's KasbahTamandot where the welcome was warm and the food excellent.

We were expecting a lot but were still amazed by the architectural beauty and sumptuousness of this grand-dame hotel. If a hotel could be given 6 starts this hotel would deserve them.    At check we were ushered to a red velvet sofa to relax and sip the freshly made almond milk scented with rose water and nibble of plump dates. Then our lovely attendant in a beautiful full length gown took down all our information and shows us to our room.    We had a room with a balcony overlooking the pool area not a suite however it was the most beautiful room I've ever stayed in. Large elegant and romantic. The entire room was intricately tiled with accents of carved plasterwork that Marrakesh is so rightly famous for. The clawed foot bathtub was deep and centered in it's own room with a Moroccan-style carved screen window. We even had a walk-in closet with leather shelves and drawers. The whole room was breathtaking.    The public rooms in the hotel were equally astounding and there were so many of them. One magnificent room after another. With fountains rich wall coverings lanterns and art. The outdoor pool was beautiful but indoor pool looked like a sultan should be perched on the dais that juts out into the tiled pool. The gardens are extensive.    I indulged in a scrub at spa because I just had to experience the tradition ""scrub bath"" that they are known for. While I was scrubbed within an inch of my life the setting was so beautiful that it didn't bother me too much. I think next time I would have a massage rather than a scrub. But the spa is definitely worth a visit!    We didn't eat at any of the restaurants since there were so many other wonderful places in Marrakesh we wanted to try. We had late night drinks at the Churchill Bar (wonderful!) and at the outside terrace bar under the stars. Both venues had live music and chic people.

The hotel is not far from the Medina but surprisingly quiet set in 8 hectares of beautiful gardens. The staff were very welcoming even though we told them we were only coming for a drink. The doormen at the main entrance were most impressive and we went from there but best to arrive reasonably smart. This place is not for the teeshirt and flipflop brigade. Although the hotel was only half full all the al fresco tables were taken which was disappointing so we had to sip our £50 Bloody Marys in a rather dark booth off the main bar but they did come with rather delicious snacks. We came away with a firm view that if we ever won the pools and Marrakech beckoned this would be the place to hang our hats. The only fly in that ointment is none of us do the pools that is.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Philippe B wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Day pass to decadence and old school service,My wife treated me to a winter day pass to this historical establishment.    From the moment we entered through the ornate doors we were part of an old school charm from a bygone era where service is first class and quality is second to none.    We had a package which included a three course lunch a treatment in their decadent spa and the freedom to roam around the hotel and gardens.

La Mamounia Marrakech,GKAPtrip wrote a review Mar 2015,40,Special but expensive stay!,Beautiful interior surroundings and décor. Large gardens is a big plus - to have morning walks in (if you make it up from the revelry the night before!). Lovely patio facing the gardens where one can relax and have a coffee/drink & snack with a view of the gardens.  Heated pools - indoors and outdoors  Fantastic breakfast & lunch buffets by the poolside!  Atmospheric Churchill bar in the hotel. Gr8 atmosphere all round.  Great service - with someone always on the standby attentively watching the patrons.  Lots of landmarks like the botanical gardens and souk to visit nearby.  Night clubs & casino are within walking distance (about 10mins) from the hotel.  Didn't use the spa myself but believe it is v good.    Interior is charming (designed I believe by a Frenchman with influences from outside Morocco as well - e.g. the ornate metal lamps lining both sides of the corridors) but quite dimly lit - I was constantly having to strain my eyes to adjust to the dim light in the corridors to the hotel rooms after coming in from the bright sunshine outside!    Very expensive - e.g. (barring the room rate) a bottle of water costs around €8 with snacks like sandwiches costing the equivalent of around €25-30. Main courses are much more......However if this is the sort of luxury boutique hotel you are looking for and are prepared to pay the price then this is definitely an alternative for you.,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GKAPtrip

La Mamounia Marrakech,lisab65 wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Fit for a princess!,My husband and I spent 3 nights (28-30 Jan (incl)) at this very special hotel celebrating my 50th birthday.    My husband booked the trip through Mr & Mrs Smith who offered complimentary transfers to and from the hotel. A hotel representative greeted us at arrivals and quickly whisked us away in the hotel's Daimler.    The drive to the hotel took us about 10-15 mins. A few minutes before arrival the driver phoned ahead to the hotel. Upon arrival we felt like royalty with a line up of staff there to meet and greet us.    We were shown to the lounge area where the check in process was completed whilst having a welcome drink of a glass of chilled almond millk with orange blossom which was very refreshing and delicious.    The hotel kindly gave us a room upgrade. We had a beautiful suite overlooking the pool and gardens. A selection of fresh fruit pastries and cold drinks were waitng for us in the room. The hotel wanted to deliver a complimentary bottle of champagne in celebration of my birthday. Unfortunately due to being prescribed an antibiotic for a tooth infection I was prohibited from drinking alcohol! Instead several bottles of different fruit juices cordials and sparkling/still water were delivered.    Every afternoon when we returned to our room there were an assortment of biscuits/cakes. A tip I would offer is don't leave your French doors open as we did. The birds had a lovely feast one afternoon when we found several of them pecking away at macaroons and leaving us their crumbs!    We dined at L'Italien on our first night. The service and food were exemplary although it lacked atmosphere due to the lack of diners.    My husband booked a guide (Najib) for the second day of our trip through the hotel. We loved him. He was friendly professional and extremely knowledgeable as you would expect. We told Najib that we didn't want to go to the Jemaa el-Fnna as we had walked there (10 mins) from the hotel the previous afternoon. Instead Najib took us to the palaces the Koran school synagogue the women's cooperative rug store. It was very interesting to walk through the streets backstreets and alleys of Marrakech.    We decided to eat lunch in the hotel every day as the grounds are so beautiful. We were fortunate during our stay that the weather was lovely and warm so we could either sit by the swimming pool or on the garden terrace. There is a good choice of light snacks drinks desserts etc all served impeccably or a buffet lunch served by the pool. My husband's diet coke and my still water were transferred into carafes so that there weren't any cans/bottles on the table.    At breakfast there is every fruit bread pastry fruit juice meat cheese you can imagine together with someone slicing smoked salmon. There is a hot menu where you can order eggs of your choice together with every accompaniment you could wish for.    The concierge recommended and booked reservations for us at Al Fassia and Grand Cafe de la Poste both excellent restaurants. Please see my separate reviews. My husband had also arranged through concierge/thr hotel for a surprise balloon ride. This was the best kept secret - thank you.    The hotel has a very relaxed and charming feel. All staff are highly professional and friendly without being obtrusive.    Our return journey to the airport in the Daimler was again stress free. The lovely driver pushed the luggage trolley into the airport and checked us in with the airline. He completed our departure forms and continued to push our hand luggage up until it was our turn to pass through the security gates and say our goodbyes.    My very grateful thanks go to each and every member of staff at La Mamounia for making my 50th birthday so very special and memorable. From the moment we arrived at the airport until the moment we said goodbye we were made to feel like the most special guests. We will definitely return and have no hesitation in recommending this very special and perfect hotel.,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Thorpe Bay, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisab65

La Mamounia Marrakech,Ian S wrote a review Mar 2015,30,Good Buffet lunch at Michelin Star prices,Recommended by several guide books and websites the poolside buffet at the La Mamounia Hotel was not to be missed. We decided to venture out and see for ourselves. Clearly a five star operation with a staff/guest ratio that would put the best cruise ships to shame. Pleasant outdoor setting at the poolside attentive and professional staff delivering a high standard of service in a relaxed and unobtrusive manner. I did not inquire about the cost of the buffet assumed it would be in line with most establishments of this caliber Rather a shock when presented with a bill for just under €300 for lunch that included fairly inexpensive bottle of wine and a bottle of mineral water. While the spread at the buffet was varied it certainly did not justify the price it rather spoiled what was a relaxed and enjoyable meal. The brunch buffets in Dubai are far more impressive and a fraction of the price. Having now dined at the hotel (albeit at the lunchtime buffet) it is off my bucket list and I doubt that I will be returning any time soon ......even if I won the lottery in the interim!,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Wokingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/611ians

La Mamounia Marrakech,Joblue32 wrote a review Mar 2015,40,Expensive tea but beautiful gardens,We called in for tea and millefeuille as recommended by the guide books. The terrace was a pleasant place to sit for an hour or so and people watch. The tea was the usual teabag and hot water - not ideal but to be expected. Very nice gateaux. The total for the two of us was about £30 which is considerable but we were there mainly for the experience.    We took advantage of the surroundings by walking around the lovely grounds sitting in the lobby and using the sumptuous toilets which incidentally had very very low lighting. I am not sure that I would bother with the tea again but might just walk around and take in the ambiance.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Quinox wrote a review Mar 2015,50,A world apart,Putting it quite simply this is a stunning property. It feels like stepping into a grandiose royal palace from another era. The decor is impeccable service is exceptional and the place itself is vast and opulent. But here's the flipside - it's so very huge that you can easily lose yourself or feel like you're rattling around inside it. That may suit your wishes as we all like peace and quiet but you get the feeling that maybe a little more activity wouldn't go amiss. The rooms are beautiful and all have a lovely view. Mine overlooked the manicured gardens with the Atlas mountains as a backdrop and it doesn't get much better than that. The bathrooms are lovely too and I recommend a soak in the beautiful deep bath; however the rooms and some areas of the hotel seem a little bit dark and you have to get the hang pf the lighting. If you want a spa treatment then book in advance as they do get busy. Breakfast by the pool is recommended too. Overall this is a place to relax and unwind if you're in Marrakech on business. If you want an all-inclusive activity holiday base it's probably not for you. But you will leave this place feeling like royalty even if you stay for just a few days.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled on business,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Quinox

This is opulence at its zenith. The building gardens pool etc is incredible.  However it is not for everyone. It is plush opulent and quite garish. This is not a place for 'normal' families first and foremost dictated by the price! And also the atmosphere ... guests are a room number or a paying guest there is nothing personal about it.

It was beautifully situated and a great place to sit but I think we may have made a mistake in not asking staff if this was ok (not that you usually have to in UK hotels for example). We sat there for 10 minutes without getting served whereas others sitting down were issued with menus etc. In the end we went up to a member of staff and asked for a tea which was served very politely (and expensively) but I still got the feeling that we had done something wrong We had a quick turn round the garden and exited. I think they could have done better after all we might have had lunch if we'd been made to feel more welcome.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Annie M wrote a review Feb 2015,50,Rolls Royce performance and priced to match,First the positives - we booked through Mr and Mrs Smith and got a good discount and swishy transport to and from the airport included. When we arrived we were upgraded (the hotel was not very busy - but very nice nonetheless).  Service from all the staff was superb they were charming and helpful.  We spent a number of evenings enjoying the cocktail lounge with a tremendous three piece jazz band who played all the old favourites. A throwback to the French colonial era - we could have been in Rick's bar in Casablanca. Most people were dressed up but they didn't mind me in trainers when we came back from a trip to the mountains.  The location is great - ten minute walk to the main square and the souk and the tombs.  The gym was adequate and empty except for my husband. Super pool with attentive staff and very comfortable loungers.  The gardens are delightful and extensive and very peaceful. There are two tennis courts and lovely areas to sit outside.  Lovely little snacks and fresh fruit left in the room each day.  The spa is luxurious with a price tag to match. I tried the hammam which is OK if you don't mind standing stark naked in the shower with a local lady who didn't speak much English lathering you up and hosing you down having first exfoliated the top two layers of skin with sandpaper. The foot massage was heavenly though.    Negatives - the cost of snacks and drinks in the bar and by the pool we felt was ridiculous. $15 for a chocolate eclair...seriously? Breakfast was fabulous but it was $37.50 each. They did serve the most delicious hot chocolate I've ever had in the bar (great after walking back from the souk in the evening).  The lighting in the hotel was rather gloomy. Very atmospheric in the bedrooms (good reading light above the bed). In the bathroom there were sixteen (yes 16) lights and a complicated system for switching them on dimming them and off which I never mastered in the week we were there. Lovely heated towel rail on the far side of the shower - so you walk back over the wet floor having hung up your towel. Nowhere to hang a towel by the basin. Such little irritations - its like the person who designed the bathroom had never stayed in it.    It was a five star experience with a five star price to match.

The lobby bars and rooms are all stylish and comfortable and perfectly presented. The staff are unerringly thoughtful and courteous.  Our deluxe room was luxurious if a little small and didn't have much of a view (being on the lower ground floor).

La Mamounia Marrakech,xiaocai wrote a review Feb 2015,30,"OK Hotel, but not impressed at all!",We stayed for two nights during christmas. Hotel seemed rather full which means that most of its 200 something rooms were booked. The problem is: Paying about 850 Euros per night for a rather simple room I expected some more exclusivity which is not the case with 400+ people queuing at breakfast plus all the tourists visiting the premises during the day. There was always a queue at reception as well as the concierge desk. The hotel felt like some huge impersonal Hilton or Sheraton resort and I certainly missed the feeling of luxury and exclusivity that I had experienced at Palais Namaskar the two days before... In addition service was inconsistent: During breakfast on both days we had to ask the waiters for spoons and orange juice several times.    Rooms are a joke. Do not book anything below the PARK AGDAL category. And even then: insist one on the higher floors. We had initially booked a Deluxe Koutoubia Room that was supposed to overlook the iconic Koutoubia Mosque. When we arrived we were told that the hotel was fully booked and we therefore would not be upgraded (which we were entitled to due to my status with Leading Hotels Loyalty program). That was fine with me until I saw the first room shown to us: While the decor was nice the room was in the basement with no sunlight at all and no view of anything but a shrub. So we called guest relations and told them we would be paying for a better room. Surprisingly there was another room on a higher floor though they claimed initially that the hotel was fully booked... Well the second room hat a view of the Mosque however it was facing the main street and was so terribly noisy that even the bellboy bringing the luggage suggested that we rather keep the other room because we would not get any sleep... So I again called guest relations and again told them to show us a PARK facing room which we would of course pay for. Again they claimed that there is nothing to be done since full occupancy... I called LHW and went online on lhw.com and mamounia.com: Both websites showed availability of SEVERAL parkside rooms. We discussed a lot and guest relations tried to sell a suite to us we were made to wait for ages: it was not until I showed the front desk the availability of the parkside rooms online they finally and sort of reluctantly agreed to assign such a room to us.    I did not really get the problem. When a guest is willing to pay for a more expensive room and there obviously are rooms available. What is the deal? Maybe it is because they refused to upgrade us in the beginning and they sort of wanted be be consistent lying about room availability or just deemed us not VIP enough? But then when a very loyal customer of Leading Hotels of the World shows up. Why would you do that? Just for compare: Palais Namaskar upgraded us from a Junior Suite to a Pool Villa (1500 Euros per night) plus free shuttles everywhere making sure that we would return.    However I have to admit that after complaining with Leading Hotels the management dealt with it quite professionally and contacted me offering to compensate for our experience during our next visit with a suite upgrade and free transfers. Though I appreciate that offer I have to admit that first impressions count and sometimes it is just too late make up for it... So thank you but we probably will not be back.    On the good side: Location was good and the park is very nice to unwind when it is not so crowded.,Date of stay: December 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Berlin, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xiaocai

La Mamounia Marrakech,LGags wrote a review Feb 2015,10,No room at the inn....??,Like some other reviewers we were also refused entry to this hotel when we stopped by to sample lunch. As we were considerably smarter in our attire than the anorak clad chap on the gate whose sartorial judgement decided our exclusion this seemed bizarre. If you visit a genuinely high class establishment and have forgotten your jacket tie or whatever item of acceptable uniform they may require then you are given the opportunity to borrow one for entry. At La Mamounia there is no such courtesy. Shocking bad form we will not be visiting again. I suggest they send their general manager over to La Sultana for a lesson in customer relations (and retention.....).

I would not recommend you to book a room unless you have cash to splash but definitely go and visit the place as a turist attraction. The gardens are extensive and beautiful and the building is exquisite and very well maintained. We had tea at the bar 7€ per tea but think of it as paying the entrance to a museum. The service was impecable and we were treated with the same respect as any other customer of the hotel nobody made us feel uncomfortable at any point and we were wondering around the place taking pictures as we moved along.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Zorro_and_Gatinha wrote a review Jan 2015,40,Do you get your money's worth? Not at high season rates....,After much agonizing over hotel choices in Marrakech we spent our first 3 days at La Sultana (see my review there) and ended our trip with 3 days at La Mamounia. If you decide to stay here your expectations are no doubt going to be incredibly high as were ours given the reputation of this storied hotel. Were they met? Not entirely......    The approach to the hotel is gorgeous especially walking in from the street but once you get inside the lobby is completely underwhelming and it was made worse by the most hideous Christmas decorations I have ever seen in a hotel. Hopefully once those are packed away a more elegant atmosphere will be restored but it will be nothing like the evocative atmosphere that greets you at La Sultana.    You are checked in from the comfort of cushy seating in the lobby area and then shown to your room by the desk clerk all very welcoming and professional. We reserved an Agdal Deluxe room since having one of those balconies pictured on the website was critical for me so this was a room several levels up from the bottom or cheapest room. Even though we had requested a high floor we were given a room on the 2nd floor so the view was disappointing. The room was fairly small with only one remarkably uncomfortable chair but thankfully there were those chairs on the balcony. The bathroom is also on the small side with only one sink but it is saved by the fact that the toilet/bidet is across the hall in a separate space. The tub is fabulous the most comfortable I've had in a long time and the separate rain shower is wonderful. The wifi was inconsistent and a bit flaky but at least it was free. Nice touches in the room were the electric exterior blinds that provide a complete black out of both sound and light and the daily delivery of an afternoon treat (different each day) and bottled water.    For the money you are spending here you will no doubt be disappointed in the overall size of the room but it has to be said that you don't check in to this hotel for the quality of the room (unless you can afford a suite - maybe then you really get something special). You check in for the ambiance of the grounds and the overall public areas of the hotel and (once you leave the lobby proper) they are truly magnificent. The gardens are park-like and beautifully maintained and manicured. The area around the huge swimming pool is very comfortably set up with many lounges; you never have to worry about finding an available one even when the hotel is at full capacity as it was during our visit. You feel completely insulated once inside the walls of the hotel yet you are only a very easy walk from the main square. I think the location really is great probably the best in Marrakech.    Exploring the hotel is fun and the hallways are decorated with vintage/period photos of Morocco and definitely worth the stroll to enjoy. The breakfast buffet is absolutely incredible probably the best I have ever seen but also the most expensive. However it would be a mistake to miss out on it. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants but did have a drink (expensive but cheaper than the Royal Mansour!) at the bar the atmosphere of which it has to be said is ruined by terrible lighting design (red sculptural tubes).    So why 4 stars? The overall facility is certainly 5 stars and that is where you get your money's worth. So make sure you REALLY enjoy every square inch of the property and that is probably not difficult since your room will not entice you to spend a lot of time in it. So it's the room that brings it down especially if you are paying anything near high season rates as we were. If the room had been $500 my review would have been different but to pay nearly twice that and get a fairly unremarkable (albeit elegant and beautifully appointed) room I can't award it 5 stars. Especially when compared to our earlier stay at La Sultana.    Between those 2 properties believe it or not La Mamounia feels a bit institutional and impersonal and cold; it is after all a really big hotel and many people will be very happy in this more familiar environment. By contrast the experience at La Sultana felt more authentically Moroccan decidedly more unique and its overall atmosphere was more evocative and breathtaking although without the outside grounds. We're happy we stayed at La Mamounia but if we went back having seen it not sure we would spend the money again.,Date of stay: December 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Los Angeles, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zorro_and_Gatinha

La Mamounia Marrakech,NMATS wrote a review Jan 2015,20,A big let down,"My family and i had high expectations of La Mamounia but were let down in many ways.  To begin with the hotel runs like a government bureaucracy. Many requests that are turned down officially can be fulfilled by bribing the many attendants around.    Despite the recent renovation the lobby is not very impressive maybe the christmas decoration made it look worse than it normally does (trees with red lights cotton snow and lots of duct tape all around hiding wires). Iust admit that the lobbies on the higher floors in which the rooms were were very impressive. There were many menacing looking men in suits all around the lobby who were definitely not trying to be discreet. I must admit that the lobbies on the higher floors in which the rooms were were very impressive.    The standard garden facing room for which i paid 600 USD was nicely decorated and the view of the gardens is amazing. The bathroom is tiny though and the shower is even smaller we had water coming into our rooms every time we took a shower. Our friends who were next door had a much larger bathroom and a walk in wardrobe when my wife went down to reception to ask if we could get a similar room we were told that all rooms in that category are exactly the same- we didn't bother arguing further as we had just flown 12 hours .    The gym is fantastic massive and equipped with all the very latest equipment and the gym attendants are probably the best amongst all the other staff in the hotel. The 2 tennis courts are superb as well.    The location is good but then again Marrakech city is really small so i don't think any of the other hotels are too far away.    The hotel has the makings of being a hallmark it's the oldest it's massive etc etc but you can tell that the key management/staff don't have the service/customer service oriented attitude that you would find at a Four Seasons or Mandarin Oriental where you know no request will be turned down and the hotel will go to great lengths to make your stay more comfortable.    In my opinion service and attitude can make or break a stay. And when you are paying a certain amount of money for a room then you want to be made to feel special which La Mamounia does not.    We visited the Royal Mansour for drinks and dinner- a world of difference in staff attitude the rooms are much more expensive and a lot of people might not be willing to pay a minimum of over 1200 dollars a night there but the place was just amazing and the staff right from the doorman (who walked us to the bar and explained the history of the hotel on the way) to the bartender who was just amazing. An example- La Mamounia's response to a request for an iPhone charger was a simple ""NO"" BARTENDER at Rpyal Mansours response was - I'll get it right away.    I wish i could recommend another hotel in Marrakech but unfortunately haven't stayed in any.    On a side note we continued our holiday to Essaouira and Fez and the hotels we stayed at there ( here bleue and palais Amani) were outstanding- staff that went out of there way to make our stay amazing. Morocco has some of the friendliest most hospitable people we had ever come across and it's a pity that La Mamounia lets them down terribly.",Date of stay: December 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Mumbai, India",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NMATS

No other hotel we've ever visited from luxury chains like the Four Seasons to fine boutique properties comes close to La Mamounia in overall conception execution and ambiance. Our family of six (four children ranging from age eight to age seventeen) my husband and I stayed for five nights and marveled perpetually at the nuances of decoration and service which set this hotel apart from any other. If you ever have the inclination to visit Morocco it is absolutely worth saving your pennies in order to experience this hotel -- and I would not advocate doing so for any other hotel in which we've stayed. Very high-end ""luxury"" hotels are almost always lovely if not beautiful places with excellent service but I would never otherwise suggest a traveler make an investment in staying in one if their budget does not readily allow it as the true essence of travel is to experience a new culture and environment not a place to sleep.

La Mamounia Marrakech,StacyBA wrote a review Dec 2014,50,The height of luxury,La Mamounia is a classic traditional 5 star luxury hotel that would appeal to clients that are seeking a connection to an historical landmark; Winston Churchill among other dignitaries have stayed here. For a more contemporary pop culture connection Sarah Jessica Parker stayed here while filming Sex and the City 2.    Upon visiting I was told that during the undertaking of the extensive three year restoration of the property that they worked with the designer Jacques Garcia from Paris to capture the essence of Morocco in the the property's new design. Humorously I commented on the torch-like lamps lighting the hallways. Apparently this is not typical of Moroccan design but Garcia had added it for a touch of mystery.    With many defining it as iconic I expected to be overwhelmed. La Mamounia is a beautiful property but it is not for everyone. Upon entering the impressive lobby my eyes immediately had to adjust to the darkness. Guests are met by a member of the hotel staff and directed to one of the many alcoves designed to offer a more intimate introduction to the hotel. Coming from the brightness of the Moroccan midday sun I felt the immediate weight of history upon walking through the doors. Needless to say it doesn't earn its iconic status lightly. The decor moved from richly texturized colors of the deep reds and browns that characterize traditional Moroccan design to deep purples and blues. In the center of the hotel stood the open courtyard emitting some light surprisingly for the scale of the property this courtyard was small. They did offer areas to sit with friends as I noticed two young ladies in deep conversation.    The property is located within a 17 acre park making it one of the only properties in Marrakech described as an oasis within the imperial city. When walking through the gardens you are nestled away from the city's noise. The gardens including its long avenues for touring consists of a vegetable garden with 15 species of tomatoes and over 30 species of vegetables salads and plants. The hotel also has an indoor pool as well as an outdoor pool. The indoor pool is located in the spa by Shiseido marocMaroc and La Ric an exquisite space that carries signature products as well. The spa offers 2 traditional hammams plus one private hammam 10 treatment rooms a relaxation room with catering and 6 outdoor massage cabins.    There are four restaurants including traditional Moroccan cuisine Le Marocain; French contemporary cuisine Le Francais; Italian contemporary cuisine L'Italien by Don Alfonso a 2-star Michelin chef at its helm; and the Mediterranean cuisine for buffet breakfast and lunch by the pool Le Pavillon de la Piscine. Along with the restaurants there are five bars with five distinctly different experiences including an ice cream and pastry bar located in the gardens from 2-7 p.m. The accommodation consists of 135 rooms 71 suites including 6 signature suites 3 Riads each with 3 bedrooms salon private swimming pool and terraces. Booking the signature suites and up gives you private transfers in either a jaguar or range rover from the airport to the hotel.    Guests for this hotel would be interested in the history of the hotel. They would be very upscale and sophisticated. Many of the hotel's clients consist of dignitaries and celebrities. I do not picture families at this hotel. They do not offer any family amenities and quite frankly children would be a nuisance to other guests.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Porto, Portugal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StacyBA

La Mamounia Marrakech,leedukeclaire wrote a review Nov 2014,50,Xanadu,We visited this hotel and restaurant on the advice of a colleague of my missus' and it's some place . It's worth noting some rooms are £32000 per night !!    The place is nothing short of stunning . The bar Churchill said was his favourite place does not disappoint it is breathtaking in aspect and oozes class and sophistication. Prices ? Cocktails and olives for two  expect to pay @£50 though it's not just about that  the place itself is one of the most elegant and atmospheric places I've ever visited. We booked the restaurant for the following evening and just walking in the grounds to get to one of the three ( we choose the al fresco ) is a delight in itself. As said the cost could be limitless  there's wine for thousands and thousands yet we ate four or five courses in one of the nicest places on earth including wine for £120.00.

The whole experience was lovely: once you walk through the main gate you walk into a calm tranquil and beautiful sanctuary ( having said that anything behind a wall in marrakech provides similar relief); the gardens are wonderful; very welcoming staff beautifully appointed reception and bar area seated efficiently ( still amazes me that you have internal smoking area within a hotel of this pedigree but I guess ones local market (and traditions) must be catered to also) decent cocktail menu at not ludicrous prices (given setting all things considered); very friendly and attentive service creative nibbles provided; the cosmohibiscus was a lovely twist but the mojito I ordered was ironically for a country which prides itself on mint tea and the abundance of the stuff chronically badly made - not strongly minted enough not quite sweet enough just a strong rum basically (which was why I couldn't rate the experience as perfect).

La Mamounia Marrakech,ruthy23456 wrote a review Nov 2014,30,Stay away,This place is overrated and not worth it. We booked a courtyard room on an online travel agency and when we arrived we were taken to a small room overlooking the roof. When we asked for the manager Sara said that she was sorry but if we had booked directly with the hotel she could guarantee the room but otherwise she couldn't do anything. At the end she offered a garden room if we paid extra every day for the 4 nights that we were staying. We didn't want to ruin our stay so we ended up paying a lot more for a better room. Yes the hotel is beautiful the furniture the fabrics the attention to detail and the gardens are extraordinary but the room was dark the bathroom was small and had terrible lighting. Worst of all everything in the hotel is overpriced: breakfast is not included and starts at $50 per person the Moroccan Restaurant has a fixed menu that starts at a minimum of $100 to $150 per person lunch was $150 for two salads… you really have to be careful. And everything related to the hotel is more expensive than anywhere else a taxi that shouldn't be more than 20-30 dirams the hotel taxis charge 100 dirams and the bellman who is getting you the cab does not really care and doesn't help. You just feel that everyone just want to get advantage of you every minute!

La Mamounia Marrakech,dome025 wrote a review Nov 2014,10,Poor Bar Service - Not Luxury at all,I have to do 2 premises before posting this review:  1) I review from 1 star hostel to George V Paris...evaluating alwau what I expect and what I have for what I pay  2) my review on Mamounia refers only to Italian Bar (no to rooms or other services)  First of all location is huge outside patio is fantastic but service at the Italia Bar is something not luxury at all!  We had an aperitivo on saturday 8 november around 7.30 pm  The hostess (red dress) does not smile while receiving you and turning around tables has a bad face. This is not acceptable for a 5 star luxury.  We ordered 2 cocktails that were ok and served on reasonable time.  The problem occured when my girlfriend tried to order a club sandwich.  We asked a menu to a waiter but never arrived so we had to ask to another one and after 10 minutes menu arrived. We ordered a club sandwich that after around 25 minutes arrived.  The sandwich was really cold (I know it is a cold sandwich but it was really cold also the bread tha usually is warm was cold) we complained and we were answered that internationally it is a cold sandwich but started eating because we waited a lot. The problem was that into the sandwich my girlfriend found cucumbers...is it cucumber internationally recognized to be on club sandwich??? I do not think so...maybe a moroccan interpretation.  So after second complain a manager arrived we discussed the problem (I have to admit he was really kind professional and solved the problem) and he offered to serve a new club. So they retired both club sandwich and fries served with the club.  After 15 min a second sandwich now better but no fries...sigh we had to ask and after 10 mins fries arrived.  UPS...while waiting between the 2 clubs I asked for a beer...but never arrived so my girlfriend had to ask a second time for my beer that eventually arrived...

We had booked a suite overlooking the Minaret but that was no more available when we arrived. Instead they offered us a presidential suite that was huge but without any charme or character.

From the moment you enter the marble portalstraverse on through the ancient wooden gates to the main hotel's entrance where the gleaming mahogany and brass art deco doors are swept open in synchronisation by two uniformed porters to welcome you into to a sea of sandlewood-scented serenityyou know you have entered in a world of comfortopulence and tranquility where every service is available on a whim.    It simply goes on and on - though the 10 acre jasmine perfumed high stone-walled gardens to the private hammantepid pool and breathtakingly beautiful garden restaurant where each table with its own private booth no doubt knows the secret of many a secret plot  it is simply perfection.    You quite simply want to live there - and the greatest ever Englishman did just that - and who can blame him.

The hotel is like a palace from ancient times with a lot of history to tell and surrounded by an amazing big park. Service was very good the food also allthough the prices are so high they have no choice. If you want to spend your time in a classical but luxury resort which is the complete opposite of what surrounds it and you don't care to pay at least 30 bucks for any dish this is the place to be. So be aware that the prices are insanely high comparing to the ground prices in Marrakech and what the employees get this is just amazing.

We had excellent meals at the pool for breakfast and both the Italian and French restaurant on property were top-notch--why go anywhere else really? And by this point in the vacation I couldn't stomach another iffy restaurant and another chicken tangine. Only a few issues...morning coffee room service was never great...half pots of expensive ""so-so"" coffee. And our room was on the side of the hotel facing the mosque hidden by a tree. There was a barking dog that yapped all night...every night while we were there. Not ideal! I would suggest being on a high floor too. Frankly I would have rather faced the pool and garden in the back. I also got a little flack for wearing expensive Prada flip flops with dress pants for dinner. We're obviously not in California. And when I walked in to the restaurant one of the staff pointed them out and got all weird and frankly caused a little scene. I excused myself and went up and embarrassingly changed shoes. It's a resort and I was impeccably dressed so the whole charade was unfortunate but I get there are rules. And lastly make it a point to enjoy the beautiful spa and the little gift store in the hotel is divine. They have the most fabulous fabric embroidered cloth bags you can wrap gifts in from the market. And before you go treat yourself to a walk in the garden and stop at the sweet shop for a treat!

Right from check-in where we had the fortune to meet Mr Amine Aboulail to check-out we found everything about this hotel to be awesome. For example one does not check-in at the desk. They ask us to seat ourselves in the lobby and they complete all our formalities while a traditional welcome drink is offered to everybody in the party.  This hotel is not one of those over-the-top garrish places that try to make their mark by going over-the top. It is subtly refined.  The gardens are beautiful the breakfast buffet by the pool sumptuous.

The quality of food and service was as you might expect for a hotel of this calibre quite superb.  The massages were undoubtedly the best we'd had.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Over T wrote a review Sep 2014,50,"Some places will leave a footprint in one's heart, this is one of them.",I had not expected to be so overwhelmed by the sheer majesty of La Mamounia. But as soon as you step through the privileged gates pass the small army of doormen and onto the deep carpets of the stunning lounge  generally exhausted by whatever travel took you there you then know you are in good hands and can deeply relax.    Everything is taken care of by the friendly professional and numerous members of the staff.  Indeed your every senses are catered for from the fragrant scents floating in the air to the soft live music sweet almond milk and dates are brought to you as you rest on soft velvet sofas as all formalities are done for you once you hand over a passport and a credit card.    Then visiting the hotel wether at night or day is like going from one film set to the other. Truly what I would call a 'destination hotel' i.e. a hotel worth the trip itself.    The large suite my wife and I were given was palatial. I was a little concerned at first about overlooking the main swimming pool but people residing here mostly couples were discreet. No noisy show-offs to be seen or heard it's just not that sort of place thank goodness..    The grounds are vast impeccably tended and an oasis of tranquility for a mid-day stroll or an evening walk.    The French restaurant offers some of the freshest and finest seafood anywhere indeed the menu will change daily depending on arrival. The service on par with the rest of the hotel is a perfect blend of 'attentive but not obtrusive'.  The Moroccan restaurant with its magical atmosphere and discreet musicians has to be experience at least once during a stay though perhaps not twice with regards to the immense portions served there.    The spa is again a place full of atmosphere as one walks throughout the dark impeccably clean rooms the facial treatment with Shiseido products was first class. The massage was less successful but it would seem to depend on the therapist's competence.  The fitness room was pleasant enough though the equipment were not as modern or well kept as one might have expected. Indeed the place was empty most of the time; this is clearly not a place for the health and fitness freaks probably a good thing as I know I'm not..    There is so much more to be said about this splendid place that is La Mamounia but then it does also consist of an indescribable atmosphere with scents tranquility a true 'dolce vita' feel difficult to find in our day and age.    Magic then is the overused term that comes to mind a place one plans to visit again even as one is sojourning a place that plays tricks with your heart.    Is there one thing to criticize just to remind one that we are still all mere mortals?  Yes the so called snacks on offer around the pool are surprisingly uninspiring and poor in quality notably a caesar salad almost uneatable with tasteless chicken slices and a tiny caterpillar on a lettuce leave. This was changed for a club sandwich after a long wait and it was dry and tasteless. Also the Nicoise salad describes as being with seared tuna came with cheap tined tuna..Never mind.    Despite that last detail which I am sure will be set right this place is in my top 5 favorite hotels in the World one to savor and to return to many times inshallah as they say..

I was especially impressed with the customer service. I agree with other reviews in that non-residents are very much made to feel welcome. The staff were all very pleasant and even offered to take a picture of us under the chandelier in the hotel foyer.

La Mamounia Marrakech,AnonymousO9586YW wrote a review Sep 2014,40,"Visually 'Amazing' , but Perhaps Challenging !",I had read much about La Mamounia and its refurbishment and on this my second visit to Marrakech decided to stay there . The location is of course very good. The interior of the building is opulent  but very dark to the point of being oppressive and the lighting in my room was very poor. Breakfast at the pool was  however  a pleasure with excellent and attentive  service  but no pressure to vacate the table . However on Sundays the poolside becomes the venue for a vast and vastly expensive lunch experience and the other dining option at lunchtime is to be tucked away in the French restaurant which has no view and is very quiet . The Italian restaurant serves perhaps the best food and the bars are buzzy in the evening  but beware the Churchill Bar if you dislike heavy cigarette smoke . The smoke -laden atmosphere was like a 1940s film  but I did not see Humphrey Bogart or any spies ( at least as far as I was aware ! ) Would I stay there again ? Probably . Its a short flight from London and in May the weather is very good but as a hotel it might usefully review its dining options  particularly on a Sunday . It is not  by the way a hotel for people who dislike staying at hotels where the public come in to take a look . People treck through the lobbies as sight seers .,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnonymousO9586YW

La Mamounia Marrakech,Maria L wrote a review Jul 2014,50,Luxurious Ambience,My friends and I stayed at the wonderful La Mamounia during our recent visit to Marrakech. Our wonderful experience began upon check in. We were greeted by the amazing musky signature scent of luxury. Our client services specialist welcomed us with a delicious milky treat and sweet dates. Our room was a one bedroom suite impeccably decorated every detail carefully thought out. Our welcome treat was a bottle of red and a wonderful selection of Moroccan sweets. The grounds are beautiful and everywhere you go whether it be celeb spotting at the outdoor terrace enjoying the start to your day overlooking the beautiful pool or having a dinner outdoors while listening to the bristle of the leaves coupled with the call to prayer you can't help but be transported and immerse yourself. After two days of sightseeing we treated ourselves to the royal hammam experience which consisted of a scrub down followed by a full body massage. Pure heaven. The breakfast spread provides both Moroccan and Western delights the french restaurant has a significant wine selection and the drinks are best enjoyed while relaxing by the terrace. As if this hotel couldn't surprise you anymore its service is the true standout. Any call we made was immediately addressed by the always amicable staff. When I needed to wrap my mirror for my travel back home they immediately sent a team member to wrap for me. They even opened one of the boutique stores for us so we can do some last minute shopping.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Cassie B wrote a review Jul 2014,20,Snobby Staff Alert!,I had heard so much about this hotel and was excited to explore its grounds and have a cocktail in their bar. But upon entry I felt like the entire staff from the doormen to the managers had their noses in the air. I saw several famous American celebrities in the short amount of time I was there so maybe that explains some of the behavior while I was there. However I had one drink at the bar and waited a long time to receive the check. Once I did they said their machines were down and they would only accept cash. They suggested I walk out to the ATM and get money. Preposterous. Not my problem their machines were down. They asked if I would wait and I said I would not even offering to buy me a round while I waited ON THEM. I waited for quite some time and told them I had to leave to make another dinner reservation. The bar manager should have offered to buy the ONE drink I had. A hotel of this caliber should have known better and it was a real mark against them in my book. As this was going on a couple overhead everything and the same thing had happened to them at check in and they had been waiting the whole day. One was a travel agent who said she was absolutely not sending her clients here because of the snobbery and inability to service.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Rebecca S wrote a review Jun 2014,50,luxury,I spent the day here on a four day trip to Marrakech with three girlfriends. We wanted a traditional visit to Marrakech so stayed in a riad (L'heure D'ete fantastic!) but wanted to spend the day at a pool on our last day to relax after the craziness of Marrakech! Our riad suggested three hotels and we opted for La Mamouni. Walking in we knew we had made the correct decision! A day pass cost 500 DAM (about £38) which included towels and 4 hours free WiFi for each of us. The pool area is very luxurious and very calming. There is a small changing area and shower which was useful as we were going straight to our airport transfer. The food was pretty expensive I had a vegetable and pesto panini and a small bottle of water which was 300 DAM (about £24). The staff were extremely polite and helpful the only difference I noticed between us as day guests and those that were staying at the hotel was that when I asked for towels we were given one to cover the bed whilst hotel guests were given two one to cover the bed and one proper towel. When I requested dry towels though we were provided with more so it wasn't an issue.

We were there eight years ago and loved it then but it did need a facelift. On our previous trip we invited 12 friends with us and took six suites. I saw them all and also toured most of the large suites on this trip. Our suite was beautifully appointed while still having a Moroccan feeling. Our check-in was a little slow because of a mistake on the part of our travel agent but the director of client services Sara was apologetic and accommodated us beautifully in a magnificent suite overlooking the pool. My husband and I both had Hammam treatments and massages in the spa which was a little dark but very serene. The treatments were great. We had dinner at the Moroccan restaurant in the hotel and lunch by the pool. Service was always impeccable. We usually slept in and had breakfast on our terrace which was wonderful.This is really a wonderfully luxurious oasis in a city that can become quite hectic.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Karen G wrote a review May 2014,50,An oasis in the desert,What a beautiful hotel and definitely worth a visit. Set in tranquil landscaped gardens on the outskirts of the hustle and bustle of the market square and souks this well run and beautifully managed 5 star hotel is sheer luxury from the front entrance to the gardens that cascade down from the swimming pool. A stay here is to be encouraged - the staff are attentive and extremely courteous and speak several languages (which does help in this heavily dominated french speaking country). The restaurants are michelin starred and the service is impeccable. If you can stay in one of the deluxe suites overlooking the pool it is a real treat as the suites are amazing and have their own private balcony/garden. Breakfast and lunch is also served by the poolside and offers an array of cold and hot choices with an oyster bar where you can have as many fresh oysters as you wish. The pool is beautiful and a respite from the sun. There are several shops and a Spa which is a real treat. Fresh dates are served in the reception area and the hotel will organise any trips or guides that are required. We hired Mohammad to take us on our City Tour and he was fabulous and a real find.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Josh G wrote a review May 2014,30,Overrated,"We spent 10 days in Morocco and saved this hotel for last. Our expectations were high and we were disappointed. It is a beautiful hotel grand and special. But it is a little snobby service was mediocre at best and I felt like they are resting on their laurels. Put it this way when I checked out having just spend a few thousand dollars no one bothered to say ""how was your stay?"". I mean what's up with that? It was indicative of the overall service.    They gave us an upgraded room a mini suite. It was so dark. The light switches are so complicated it's annoying. there was no balcony (make sure you get one if you go). I complained. They brought us to a handicapped modified room which I declined (I don't park in handicapped spots either). Finally hours later they brought us to the basement like it's for bad guests or something. it had a little patio and some light so we just took it. Our bad experience. I wrote to the hotel when I got home; their response was callous and not of the caliber you'd expect from a property like this.

Truly one of the world's greatest hotels. The history and the list of guests over the years tells the story of the 20th and 21st centuries. And as a guest you can share in that history in the recently renovated but carefully preserved interior in the amazing gardens so loved by Winston Churchill and in the elegant and excellent restaurants.    The buffet breakfast and again the buffet lunch by the pool are outstanding and certainly keep you happily in the hotel until the cool late afternoon when a visit to the town is more comfortable.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Paul H wrote a review Apr 2014,30,Sir Winston Churchill Bar,"We are travelling as a group of 14 and stayed at the lovely Riad Laroussa (Marrakesh Medina) which was great we made a booking for pre dinner drinks at La Mamounia for our group and were ushered into the Sir Winston Churchill Bar as all other bars were fully occupied. Being such a large group on a busy day (Good Friday) restricted our options I guess. The bar was extremely dark and is a piano bar / cigar bar really set up for late night last drinks. The service was very slow and not many customers in this bar at the time we were there (9.00pm ) We almost walked out because of the prices and slow service (320 Dirhams for Gin and Champagne cocktail). We persisted and US$400 later for one drink each we felt ripped off. We all went for a walk separately through the lobby and Terrace Bars to the amazing gardens and can see how special this Hotel is. Would not recommend the experience of this bar to anyone for pre dinner drinks perhaps it was the only bar they had that night that could accommodate a group of our size we probably should have split into three.  We eventually left for dinner at a French Restaurant in an industrial estate ""Le Zinc"" had great food beer and copious quantities of wine for about the same price as one drink each at SWC Bar.  Had we of had a drink in the Terrace area I am sure this review would have been very different in this amazing Hotel.",Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Brisbane, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulH972
La Mamounia Marrakech,JoJoTourist wrote a review Apr 2014,30,"Fab hotel, poor restaurant experience","We stayed in Marrakech for 5 days early April staying at Riad Tahili Spa - (which was lovely see separate review). I have given La Mamoumia three stars for the lovely grounds and the excellent staff and service however the restaurant experience we had was poor. Be warned everything here is very expensive but then you are paying for the lovely setting and the excellent service.    We visited La Mamoumia a couple of times once during the day for coffee and a walk around their absolutely fabulous gardens and a second time for cocktails (lovely experience) and then dinner at their Morocain restaurant.    Unfortunately the dinner experience was not only incredibly expensive (200€ for two with just one small glass of wine each) but neither was it the gastronomic experience we were hoping for.  One the plus side the service was fantastic but then when there are three staff at the bottom of the stairs just to take guests up to hand them over to the Maître De it should be.    Be warned there is a live ""trio"" playing in this restaurant and they take turns around the restaurant to stand and serenade you - great if you like that sort of thing but I really don't especially if I am attempting to eat my dinner.    Dinner is priced at either 750 drh for two courses or 900 drh for three (plus a further soup course which is also included so it's actually three or four courses!). We were offered either still or sparking water with the meal but we didn't realise that this was a further 100 drh - we had thought it was included in the price.    We chose to have one first course two main courses and one pudding. The first course (after a fairly bland soup had been served - but not for me as it contained onions) was perfectly acceptable but not exceptional similarly with the pudding which was creme brûlée nice but really sweet with a particularly thick crunchy caramelised topping. It was the main courses that really let the meal down. Because of food allergies I ended up with the mixed grill - not a meal I would usually have chosen as I am not a massive meat eater but as I can't eat onions this was the only available option. It was quite dry and consisted of four very small sausages shish kebab two tiny lamb chops and two small pieces of chicken. It was accompanied by a salsa (sans onion) which was basically chopped tomato and cucumber. Here I can't fault the service and the waitress on her own initiative took great pains to check and then double check with the chef that no onion had been included. Mr JJT had a lamb tagine which he ate but didn't rave over it certainly wasn't the best he had had but it was most definitely the most expensive.    Overall I think my view is colour by the cost of this meal coupled with the fact that it wasn't that exciting or tasty. I know you can get better with more variety for cheaper elsewhere - try La Foundouk (if you can find it in the Medina).",Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoJoTourist

You can find fantastic options for starters  meat and fish. We had a marinated salmon as a starter and a fillet as a mail course. They were both delicious. We also had an amazing Apple Pie as a desert. Service was above standards and the place in the park of La Mamounia spectacular.  The restaurant is not cheap of course. We paid 200 Euros for 2 persons full course with starter  main course dessert and wine. But consider that it is a 2 star Michelin Restaurant and in such restaurants you could pay much more elsewhere  Except of the dinner if you do not stay at La Mamounia as we did it is a must to visit this Historic Hotel witch exists for more than 90 years and a dinner at ""Le Francais"" is a fantastic reason to do it.",Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Lagonisi, Greece",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Npasxa

La Mamounia Marrakech,YG - travel wrote a review Mar 2014,20,Overrated legend - La Mamounia,"We had a 2night stay in la Mamounia with my wife. On a positive note the location of the hotel is excellent recently renewed property with impressive gardens and good quality of facilities. However everything falls short of expectations compared to the price tag of 800-900 USD pn/ per room and 150 USD pp dinners. We initially booked a Koutoubia deluxe room which was pretty much an ordinary smallish room  rather dark and with quite some noise from the street- enlightened supposedly with the view of the Koutoubia mosque; after long arguments with a rather unfriendly reception we realized that this is pretty much the standard problem of the hotel with disappointed couples lined up complaining  and in an eventful way we were ""upgraded"" to a room with some better light; only to find out that our breakfast supposedly included in our bill - written clearly by the agent- is not included but it is a rather a standard way of the hotel misleading people with a confusing account statement .  We had a dinner at the Moroccan restaurant - tagine  pastillias etc.- in an awkward setup looking eye to eye from 1m to a French couple; I have not seen many restaurants that failed in service- confusing literally everything with our neighbors- and shameful quality of food in such degree. You need to count everything in La Mamounia is double the price of the best in class restaurants of Morocco  same wine twice the price etc. end result was 300 Usd per couple of disappointment. Fortunately we had some decent food in the medina next day to recover! Food quality in general compared to comparable international chains is mediocre.  Even the taxi called by the hotel security seems to claim - this is La Mamounia and wants to charge double as they are paying commissions to hotel and you end up fighting for a taxi ride you have been told will cost 50Dirham but taxi is asking 100 as per LM tariff.

La Mamounia Marrakech,FREDRIK20032014 wrote a review Mar 2014,10,Nice facilities but...,We are usually spending our time in either high end hotels or the ones scoring highest in (for example) Tripadvisor. We wanted to have a first impression of La Mamounia before coming back this fall. The reviews from other visitors are not that good so we would not blindly choose this hotel. We were fascinated by the pictures we have seen on the internet. So why not start with a tea and cake there and feel the atmosphere? We walked from our splendid Ryad to La Mamounia cosy dressed. The guy at the entrance said we were not welcome because I was wearing sport shoes. Just to mention it here top end Asics shoes I guess double the price of normal toxido shoes! And in very good shape. After some discussions it seemed that we would be authorized to come in after all. But after our first step in suddenly appeared a colleague of that guy who said with a very sufficient voice and manner that we were not welcome because we were not properly dressed! I told her I would tell the story on Tripadvisor but she did not even answer waiting for us to leave. You know exactely the way you are chasing away a poor tramp asking for charity. Absurd.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Rotex29 wrote a review Mar 2014,50,Superb Hotel in a Great Location,Attending a medical conference in Marrakech this hotel was centrally located and very close to the old market convention centre and other attractions. It was very convenient and service was outstanding. Check in was a breeze and front desk staff was very helpful and efficient. Good english was spoken by all staff encountered at the hotel and I was shown up to my room by the bellman who spent time explaining all amenities services etc. as well as insuring I was comfortable. The hotel has a good restaurant available for breakfast lunch and dinner with both continental and local fare. A casino is also available onsite if one is so inclined. The proximity to the old market is great and it is recommended that one hires a guide to take you through this can be done at the hotel as the concierge will arrange one for you. Not only will they take you around the market but explain some of the history associated with parts of it such as the slave market etc. My guide was from Vancouver who was transplanted in Morroco and he was great. Spoke Canadian English but also spoke Arabic and French. The rooms at the hotel were comfortable and spacious very clean and had all amenities including a large bathroom. If going to Marrakech this hotel is highly recommended.,Date of stay: April 2013,,"Ontario, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rotex29
La Mamounia Marrakech,Em-Atlanta wrote a review Mar 2014,50,Incredible. Service was extraordinary.,"We stayed 5 nights in early March. By far the most incredible service we've ever experienced. When they say ""At your service Mrs. V..."" they really mean it. My husband had a headache the first night and they went to the pharmacy and brought tylenol to our room... The Wifi wasn't working and my husband had work emails to send and they comped our dinner. They arranged everything were truly kind and greeted us every time we walked through the hotel. What everyone says about the F&B being expensive is true. It's very high priced... about $17 a glass for the least expensive wine about $30 for a simple salad with tuna. $10 for water and coke which can by typical though. But the hotel is so incredible we spent about half our time at the hotel. The pool is beautiful and relaxing the breakfast buffet is fit for a king. I had one traditional hamman bath - it was fantastic. Our room was on the smaller side but we had a nice terrace it was perfectly clean bathroom was beautiful... The detail is everywhere.

When calling the night before I was told the Buffet Luncheon was closed until 2/22 so I settled for a reservation for 12:30 at their French Restaurant. Need I say more but we were the only two guests for the entire luncheon - service was good but nobody bothered to put our napkins across our laps. After $220 incl. tipl at 3 PM we were done and wandered out in their garden and what did we see to our surprise the buffet luncheon was just winding down. That really floored me. Talking to the head conscierge about this I got many apologies but my visit was marred. The hotel paid for our cab fare back to our hotel - $2.50 - which I did not really want - to show their concern. However I will not be back - the Ciragan in Istanbul was much classier so was the Negresco in Nice not to talk about the Hotel de Paris in Monte Carlo - but it was an experience I'll never forget.

Although not a problem for us you should not even attempt to visit La Mamounia if you are wearing jeans trainers or anything that doesn't fit in with a 5 star luxury hotel dress code. The opulence of the hotel is enticing and so tastefully refurbished in the recent makeover. The staff were charming and very attentive and we greatly enjoyed cocktails and lunch on the terrace whilst soaking up the atmosphere and people watching some of the beautiful local wealthy people. Our lunch wasn't particularly expensive and I would certainly consider returning to stay at this lovely hotel although if I was a guest I would not wish to have non residents sitting at the poolside restaurant.

La Mamounia Marrakech,B L wrote a review Mar 2014,30,"We got in, in spite of our backpacks and tennis shoes :-)",For us it was the challenge of getting in. We were staying at gorgeous riad in the medina and told the owner that we'd get in. She said we wouldn't so I had to prove her wrong. They said we couldn't take our backpacks in so we left them at the gatehouse and got claim checks. The doormen at the front seemed to find our entrance amusing so I took a picture with them. The lobby was very nice but seemed almost tomb-like. No one was around so we just walked through used their restroom and left.  It was mostly amusing for us. But I'd never stay there.

We stayed in Room 242 - a large double room & a very spacious bathroom at the rear of the hotel overlooking the gardens. We had dinner in La Morocaine on the first night - excellent food atmosphere waiting staff & entertainment. Breakfast was by the poolside - the breakfast selection was enormous - anything you could possibly want. The spa treatments were excellent and the gym complex facilities (located in a separate pavilion in the hotel grounds) were of a very high standard. We had afternoon tea at La Menzah - a small pavilion in the hotel grounds - lovely service & high quality food. The immaculate hotel grounds are very quiet considering the central location of the hotel. The pool was superb and the poolside staff as with all the hotel staff paid attention to every detail - faultless service. We only had 2 criticisms of this hotel - smoking is allowed in the inside bar area and around the pool - we were frustrated that this perfect hotel was allowing smoking at all and secondly some of the day pass visitors are not respectful of the peace tranquility of the poolside area. The hotel staff could have been more proactive in monitoring and dealing with the behaviour of the day visitors.

Our DK Top 10 things to do in Marrakech had this as a must do but our Riad owner said we probably wouldnt get in on a weekend. We also rang to ask but were told they did not have any availability. I thought they may not have understood our question so decided to give it ago anyway and we are so pleased we did. We dressed up smartly and walked straight in. How I wish I had a better paid job as I could have checked in there and then! We had a walk around the grounds and day dreamed of sunbathing round the amazing swimming pool before having a beer in the Italian bar (£7.00 for one bottle of beer). The waitress was extremely helpful and efficient asking whether we liked our beer poured frothy or not! We were also given pastries and a glass of cucumber water which was a very nice touch. A piano player base player and a drummer played in the background. It was perfect. We loved it so much that we then went to the Churchill bar for a beer and wine.

Quite frankly the meal was very poor and over-priced - around £20 for a club sandwich and some chips and £10 for a bottle of Budweiser - though we had no complaints about the service which was good. That however is beside the point as our aim was to experience the ambience of the hotel and its superb garden and in that respect it did not fail us. The kitchen garden was of particular interest to us as my wife is a keen gardener.

As others have commented the service really wasn't that good in fact we were stunned to have a patio heater moved from near us closer to a visibly wealthier couple. The ashtray on our table was covered but had clearly been well used and stank and the service was really slow and not very attentive. We had our cocktails and left.

The suite we had was really very beautiful overlooking the gardens full of orange trees bearing fruits and the room makes you feel like you are in a morroccan palace from the living room to the bedroom and the bath. I love the Moroccan restaurant with its delicious food and music in such lovely exotic atmosphere but I was disappointed by the french one. The Churchill bar is one of the most beautiful bars I've seen but unfortunately they don't have cigars. So we asked them to get it outside the staff was really helpful. Service was very good from the pick up with their Jaguar from the airport and also for small things like asking for their lovely pastries they are always there to please and assist. Breakfast was excellent  many choices and fresh juices as well and the bar drinks were also lovely.

La Mamounia Marrakech,TravelInEase wrote a review Jan 2014,40,"Beautiful property, great location, service ok.",La Mamounia is a beautiful property close to the city center. The lobby was beautiful and had some Christmas decoration still. You were greeted and sat down in the lobby for check-in. They bring almond milk and dates to snack on while you wait.    Rooms: Originally we booked a classic room which we stayed in for one night. While the bedroom was a sufficient size the room with the toilet was tiny. You couldn't sit down on the toilet without your knees touching the door and I'm pretty tiny.There was a shower room with a separate bathtub. The room was on the first floor so no view. We ended paying for an upgrade to a deluxe room which was much larger and nicer. This made staying at the hotel a completely different experience. The deluxe room was on a higher floor with a balcony overlooking the pool and sweeping views of the Atlas mountains. The toilet/bidet room was much larger and a separate shower and bathtub room. The shower rooms had windows from the bedroom with no curtains just ornate woodwork. The bed was firm but the pillows were flat and not very supportive. Decent sized flat screen TV and closets in the hallway from the entrance of the room.    Room Service/Housekeeping: Expensive. We only did breakfast and mint tea and desserts a couple times but it was pricey. We asked for the almond milk we got for free upon check-in and they ended up charging us $10 for a small glass! Food was decent but not worth what you pay for it. Housekeeping did a good job but removed some food we had originally set aside to keep. We ended up hiding food we wanted to keep in the drawers.    Service: Service was good but not amazing for the level of hotel. There seem to be some communication barrier. Everything took a long time to figure out and we would tell them we wanted or didn't want something and we'd get the opposite. We asked to change rooms and it took almost 30 minutes while they seated us in the lobby for them to figure out what was available. Any time we asked for something we were told to sit in the lobby and they would get back to us. When we finally got a room change we said we wanted to move our own luggage. They still sent someone to help us anyways.    Restaurants: We ate at the Moroccan and French restaurant. I would not recommend the Moroccan restaurant. It was extremely expensive and food wasn't as rich in flavor as other places you could find in town. French restaurant was great for lunch. Food was delicious but expensive and the menu read more as an Italian restaurant.    Spa: I had read that the hotel's spa was supposed to be amazing. After the Bora Bora Four Season's spa this one pales in comparison by far. I was expecting a full facility with pools etc to relax in before or after the massage. However they only had a sauna that may have been slightly broken (there were puddles over water as you walk into the room) and various showers and treatment rooms. The massage itself was somewhat not relaxing. I wanted deep tissue so had a male masseuse. For some reason he thought massaging me at a very rapid rate and rubbing me very quickly would be relaxing but it was not. Not the best experience. Perhaps another masseuse would have provided a better experience.,Date of stay: December 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Los Angeles, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelInEase

La Mamounia Marrakech,Paul R wrote a review Jan 2014,50,Wonderful Moroccan experience.,Everyone should spend at least one night at the La Mamounia in Marrakech. My wife & I spent 3 glorious nights here being pampered like never before. From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty.  On our arrival we were taken to one side by Amine Aboullail the guest relationship leader offered a drink and dates and despite my wife being in a wheelchair nothing was to much trouble for him and his staff. After he checked us in he told us we had been upgraded from a ground floor room to 2nd floor suite and we had not even asked for it. While waiting for our room to be prepared we had a look at the stunning pool and grounds which total 20 acres or so.  Amine came to find us when our suite was ready and it was just sumptuous with a bedroom sitting area with 2nd TV and walk through dressing room into the wet room bathroom. As you would expect the décor was very Moroccan and very clean as the hotel has was only reopened a couple of years back after an expansive 3 year redecoration programme. The housekeeping was everything you would expect from a hotel of this quality. The bed linen was changed every day and the towels possible twice in a day if needed. The room had every accessory you might need.    The hotel has 3 restaurants. The French Italian & Moroccan. We ate in the Italian on one night and the food was just delicious and we had our own team of waiters for the food and wine. The quality of the food was just excellent as you would expect from a hotel of this quality and although the wine was not cheap it was not as expensive as I would have thought. We also had a snack one afternoon in the Italian bar which was just as good as the main restaurant.    Some people might find the lighting a bit subdued which it is however this does add a lot to the overall atmosphere of the place. The main reception area has many little nooks & crannies where you can just sit and watch the world and high level guest go by. We used the spa a couple of times and found this a very relaxing way to finish the day off before going out for dinner.    Breakfast is not included in the room rate and some might say expensive at about £30.00+ per person! However when you looked at what is available from a very large selection of cold meats and smoked salmon to all sorts of fresh fruits breads cakes and hot selections and that you could sit there by the pool for as long as you like I think it was good value.    Wifi is available throughout the hotel and in our room and we had no problems using it at any times. Overall our experience was one of pure luxury and if we can we would like to come back again.,Date of stay: January 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Reading, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/204PaulR204

La Mamounia Marrakech,Turkanaboy wrote a review Jan 2014,50,Mamounia Express,We spent three nights at La Mamounia for our Xmas holidays. My wife had always wanted to go there so I saved hard and indulged family into the Mamounia experience.  The place is grand starting from the politeness of the hotel's chauffeur driving you from the airport to a platoon of doormen in different attires that are there just to open the doors to you. Superb hostesses in elegant costumes welcome you upon arrival and literally you cannot do anything but just relax look around and sip a delicious refreshing beverage while they take care of your registration and hotel keys.  The thing that strikes more about the hotel is by far the huge luxiuriant park  with 7 hectars of neatly planted and trimmed gardens. A fantastic place  to wander around meditate relax stroll and play with your kids.  There are also three excellent restaurants of which we tried the Moroccan one the other two being two-star italian and french chefs.  Spa is excellent standards as one would expect from the level of service boasted by the hotel.  All in all a very pleasant experience with excellent staff at your service.  Only negative point I reserved  because hotel website showed no vacancies thorugh an on-line booking service called Mr&MrsSmith. Initially they showed very good response and quality service and even provided slightly lower fares than hotel itself (I thought because they would reserve a block of room getting better conditions).  However we quickly found out their shortcomings: first a complimentary chauffeur supoosed to drive us from Marrakech airport to hotel never showed up. My calls to their assistance center were not returned and apparently this assistance center either did not exist in practice or was on holidays. But then I got an email message apologizing for the missing chauffeur and also saying that we would be charged the extra bed for my child which was not included in the initial reservation ! Of course I had made sure to include that extra bed and even showed that in their confirmation (which I still have) but no they claimed a hidden clause maintaining even if it showed in the conifrmation this amount had to be paid apart.  In short this is how they make their bucks a cheap way to profit on their clients. No big deal as in the end we paid approximately same amount as if had reserved thorugh hotel directly (which was fully booked when I first tried) but it's annoying their way of doing.  Luckily we got complimentary from the hotel Staff who treated us superbly a very nic ride back to the airport on the hotel's Jaguar sedan.  Highly recommended staying but... save well in advance to afford the place !,Date of stay: December 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Lugano, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Turkanaboy
La Mamounia Marrakech,aroperofmischief wrote a review Jan 2014,50,Once in a lifetime experience,My husband chose the La Mamounia for its sumptuous surroundings and decadence. Set in I believe 13 hectares of grounds you are driven through past security to a world beyond your dreams.    There are staff to attend to your every need. The decor newly refurbished is dark and the aromas tickle your nose. The lighting is subdued in most areas and may not be to everyone's taste.    We were upgraded and despite being in a wheelchair nothing appeared to be too much trouble for the staff as they dealt with our every needs. Amine who looked after us was perfect in his manner attention to detail and ensuring my husband was happy with everything. We were upgraded which was a pleasant surprise and shown the grounds whilst we waited for our suite to be ready.    The grounds are stunning as are the indoor and outdoor pools. Amine came to find us when our suite was ready and we were taken accordingly to the suite. It was beautiful and with wet-room too. Having terminal cancer this stay was special to us and was out of this world.    We dined in the Italian restaurant. Lighting is very dark in some of the areas and I had to use the table light to view my menu but that was fine. Food was served well and we had our own team of attendants during the meal. There is also a French and Moroccan restaurants too to suit your tastes.    Wifi was free and we had no problems using it in the grounds or in our room. All in all our stay at the Palace was one to remember for the care quality of service and attention to detail.    Breakfast was served by the pool as was lunch and there was an abundance of food to choose from. Breakfast is charged separately but you can dine on as much as you want.    I will never forget my stay here and would like to thank everyone for their kind attention and service to us.,Date of stay: January 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Reading, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aroperofmischief
La Mamounia Marrakech,TMA-7 wrote a review Jan 2014,40,Beautiful but huge,This is an excellent hotel where no expense was spared in renovation and there is an abundance of helpful staff. The pool is enormous and inviting. Our suite was fantastic with an excellent bathroom all in the style of the area ie quite dark with lots of wood and tile. You do not hear your neighbors or the slamming of doors at night or in the morning which I really appreciate. Excellent restaurants on the grounds. Very restful and beautiful place albeit a bit anonymous due to its size.,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Brussels, Belgium",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMA-7

A Ceasar salad of limp lettuce two chopped tomatoesa few gratings of cheese and a small over cooked piece of chicken with a tasteless dressing was not what I was expecting given the palatial surroundings. My local Cafe Rouge prepares the same dish but it is visually exciting contains lots of fresh ingredients and has a tasty dressing for a quarter of the price.

La Mamounia Marrakech,SusannaS72 wrote a review Jan 2014,40,Extremely beautiful property,We just returned from la mamounia a few days ago. We stayed there with our 3 kids and were very satisfied with the hotel and the staff. The hotel is very beautiful and the staff always had a big smile on their faces with the exception of the Spa desk girls whom I found not too pleasant. Room service was also rather on the slow side. One night we had to wait for an hour and fifteen minutes to be served and they managed to forget my kid's meal. The kitchen was apparently very busy but it is high season after all. Their free fruit basket was also on the cheap side since it only consisted of a very small amount of fruits. I've had much generous free fruit basket from the Sofitel and the palmerai resort. Overall I still loved this place because it had amazing Morrocan architecture. I would definitely return to La Mamounia.,Date of stay: December 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Geneva, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusannaS72
La Mamounia Marrakech,RachelBlech wrote a review Jan 2014,20,One hour to serve a sandwich and cold tea,Today I took clients for afternoon tea on the Italian Terrace at La Mamounia Marrakech in very pleasant winter sunshine. One English Breakfast tea one Earl Grey tea one tepid Moroccan mint tea (which had to be sent back) plus a small plate of Moroccan patisseries and two very average roast beef open sandwiches (which took a full hour to be served) - €80!!!! Nobody impressed. Surely this price tag should mean the kitchen is staffed adequately for High Season.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Bothercollie wrote a review Jan 2014,50,Paradise aint Cheap,Check in consisted of our being led to a couple of very comfortable chairs with welcoming snacks and beverages while the staff completed the paperwork. After about 15 minutes we were escorted to our room with terrace overlooking the swimming pool and garden. The Atlas mountains filled the background of our view highlighted by a full moon. The room and bath were huge and gloriously furnished and extremely comfortable. Fresh fruit was provided daily.  I loved having early morning coffee on our terrace the birds attempting to steal our breakfast were charming and entertaining.  The hotel is a short walk to the Marrakesh medinas and other attractions. I found the staff knowledgeable very helpful no request was too much.  The fitness room was good but I was not I spent my time in the hamam and spa. Heaven.  We had dinner in all three restaurants all were excellent but nothing to write home about. Even being on the expensive side they provided good value for the money.  Breakfast was not included in our rate and a full breakfast was about $50 per person however Oysters Rockefeller among other goodies were available on the buffet. A continental breakfast also is an option.  Yes they do have (and enforce) a dress code. Frankly I am quite happy being able to go to a bar and not having to sit next to someone in flip flops and a tank top.  I loved this hotel and did not want to leave and cannot wait to return.

It Is simply the best and the most luxurious hotel in Morocco and the best inside the Medina. The contrast between the old city and the impeccable beauty of this place is amazing. Everything is perfect the decor the service the food. Nothing bad you can say about this hotel. Certainly one of the best hotels I've ever stayed. La Mamounia is huge. There are an outdoor pool a beautiful indoor heated pool two tennis court a great gym and a beautiful garden.

The breakfast is feast! however the food in their Moroccan restaurant was somehow disappointing.

The best thing at the hotel is the big garden they have. It is like a park. It is nice to have a walk during the morning or before sunset.    they grow there own vegetables and fruits in the garden.    The rooms were has the moorish architecture and you feel as you have gone back to the 1700s.    The only thing is that my room was near the road and early morning you here the traffic of the cars.

La Mamounia Marrakech,grwebster wrote a review Nov 2013,50,over 90 years of excellence,I last stayed at La Mamounia over 20 years ago. Back then it was always considered as one of the best and nothing has changed since despite the recent 3-year renovation by J Garcia. It isn't like any other hotel in the world and is successful in keeping its styling roots firmly in the arts and crafts of Morocco and reflecting the spirit of one of its first designers Jacques Majorelle who helped in many aspects of the original 1920s construction.  The gardens of the hotel are just astonishing lush and full with many types of palms fruit trees The pool area is huge as is quality and service of the pool restaurant.  The rooms were just about perfect- top quality bedding garden views bath facilities- one point here is to be cautious with the very slippery smooth marble floors in the shower/bath area and if you like to read on anything other than a e-book/iPad in the bathroom bring your own flashlight as the room is dark.  All the personnel were welcoming and the basic services as in-room dining were efficient.  La Mamounia is a must visit hotel {er.. palace?

La Mamounia Marrakech,Invisible Middle Aged Female traveller wrote a review Nov 2013,30,Don't bother!,We visited this hotel on a recent trip to Marrakech. I guess we wanted to see why it was so special. We are still asking that question..... Marrakech is a city with many beautiful Riads with stunning gardens and lovely swimming pools personal service friendly helpful staff and representing good value for money. La Mamounia really lacked charm the gardens reminded us of a municipal park and were not memorable. The food was good but soooo expensive for what it was.

La Mamounia Marrakech,marcopolopaloalto wrote a review Nov 2013,50,"Magical, Moroccan and out of this world",""" ...which takes its name from the 200-year-old gardens presented as a wedding gift to Prince Moulay Mamoun by his father King Sidi Mohammed Ben Abdellah namesake of Morrocco's current monarch. Filled with 400-year-old olive trees those gardens now sprawl for 20 well-manicured acres setting the scale for the hotel itself which opened back in 1923. ""    It was the last hotel stop on our National Grographic Around the World in 23/24 days and they do 'save the best for last' in terms of luxury hotels. You may not want to leave to even visit the Suqs and night market or drive to the Atlas Mtns to see nature and the tribal Berbers. The hotel is exotic and made even more so with its sumptuous gardens pool red velvet couches Arabic musician playing in the orner of the lobby in late afternoon and very dim lighting ( really dim).    The bedrooms are a bit on the small side but we had a balcony facing the gardens which even at night have a magical glow. The Morroccan bedroom slippers placed by your beside t night are a treat as are the delicacies brought each afternoon to your room - pistachio cookies small pears chocolate chip scones (?) along with mineral water. Two friends got suites and they were also on the small side even the Hermes leather drawer outfitted closets are not spacious. But the draw is the detailed Mortocan tiled rooms whose decor and feel ate the draw and add to making the hotel a place of beauty and a world within a world inside the ""medina""  the old walled city of Marrakech. The beds all seem to have been furnished with feather beds.    The lobby has many alcoves where people can gather and talk. The hotel bar is clubby yet dazzling.    Horse drawn carriages and taxis are right outside the entrance.    The only negatives besides that of course the price of the lodging is that the lighting IS dim and I needed to read my instruction sheet on how to work the lighting in the room and in bathroom. But staff is helpful in showing one how to navigate the lights and TV and the shutters which can open and lose electronically. The other negative is that WiFi is slow. however those of us on upper floors found speedier Internet.    Th gift shops have lovely things which are also found in the Suq (Shuk) for a fraction of the price.  There is also a casino to the right of the hotel which has an ATM.    The breakfasts are very good and the chefs really know how to tailor eggs and omelettes to everyone's particulars. The morning breakfast spread is fit for a king or caliph.    The airport is about a fifteen minute drive away...but inside the hotel one is a world away from the familiar.",Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Palo Alto, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcopolopaloalto

The hotel really is worth the stars it claims and the price it charges the staff could be a bit more professional for the standards it claims but not a problem. The garden the pool the rooms general cleaningness just perfect. The Moroccan restaurant is something that must be considered. Excelent location. Only thing not very confortable at the hotel is that they allow visitors but don t control the number so sometimes you re at a premise and a visitor asks you to move away so they can take a photo (happened to me). It needs to be thought over  because sometimes the number of ppl inside the halls becomes a nuisance. I ve seen buses of tourists unloading visitors to the hotel.

La Mamounia Marrakech,LouisArdmore wrote a review Oct 2013,30,Dissappointing,My husband and I booked in for a meal at the Moroccan restaurant here and were dissappointed.    We had been at Royal Mansour and thought this would be similar - we had high expectations but were let down. Yes the reception area is lovely but there are a lot of kids here and the standard of dress was not up to scratch I don't think. When you are paying that much to be in a beautiful hotel that has had a 20 million facelift I would expect people to wear something a little more than crocs or dirty shoes to the Churchill Bar at night. There were also women in swimsuits running through the bar at 8pm dripping wet from the pool. I know that must sound like a petty thing to complain about to some people but it actually annoyed me considering the money you are paying for drinks/dinner/ and hotel here.    The reception area is grand and beautiful as are the garden. Yes sure we had a lovely evening but the food standard was not as good as it should have been for the prices we paid. Deep fried food that seemed to come out too quickly! We hardly had time to have conversation in between or courses. The waiters were great but the door staff at the restaurant were arguing with each other when we left and it was not professional in my view.

The hotel grounds lobby pool restaurants and lounges are spectacular especially considering the location within the walls of the old city of Marrakech. Our room was dark and the light switches were so complicated we never did figure them out. The bathroom was on one side as you entered and the toilet on the other. This was fine but the shower was clearly an afterthought in the remodel and was tiny with no door creating quite a wet bathroom.  We enjoyed dinner sitting outside in the traditional Moroccan restaurant and had the best pastilla of our whole trip there.  If we hadn't had issues with our room I would give this hotel a stronger recommendation.

Within minutes of it being served and the waitress kindly taking our photo I began to feel hot & faint (I'd felt below par all day). The waitress led me out to the foyer and sat me down. Water was brought and other staff including the manager offered to fetch a doctor. I felt this was not necessary and after a cool towel began to feel much better. A taxi was organised and we headed back to our riad. If non guests are treated this well I can only imagine how fabulous it must be for those lucky enough to be staying!

Do not bother to look for an alternative in Marrakesh because there isn't. I have visited all the other contenders as Royal Mansour Four SeasonsTaj Namakasar (why someone is building hotels in the middle of nowhere ?) or Delano and others. Although some of them can look impressive (especially in the pictures) they do not have the soul and the spirit of La Mamounia.  Covering the basics : Top Location ( walking distance all around Medina souks etc Unique Design ( remodeled with Jacques Garcia this hotel is a showcase of the Moroccan architecture and design Impressive services in all the outlets and facilities Magnificent Garden in the Medina Transcendent history The Flavors and Sounds of Marrocco.

When we got there tons of staff willing to help and 99% of the time smiling and doing their greatest effort to give us a good time.  The hotel is HUGE and very beautiful.  My room was good but not great specially compared to my friend's... the funny fact was that I payed a little more than they did... minor problem  The swimming pool was very good and staff was always helpful.  Breakfast was excellent but not included - I think it was something aroun 40 euros.  Spare money for tips specially in a Hotel with such ammount of people doing things for you.

We even finished the holiday in style by paying 300 dirhams for a lovely Mercedes to take us to the airport.    It is a little oasis of calm amidst the hustle of Marrakech and an absolute pleasure.

It is truly a fabulous property! We spent 4 nights there and loved every minute of it! Its simply sumptuous. The pools the gardens the rooms and the staff are all wonderful. Worth every penny we spent. I opted out of one of our touring days to lounge by the pools use the fitness rooms & to enjoy a facial. It was all great.One night we had dinner in the French restaurant and that was delicious too! A nice respite from all the traditoinal tagines we had already eaten in Morocco.

Garcia... but it's a place to enjoy quiet and peaceful time with your family. Breakfast is OK... but food experience is definitely an afterthought .. Maybe during the law season they changed the menus ... but after 2 tries... we preferred to have our meals outside... the pool restaurant and service was really bad and people rude!  we definitely recommend the place and return to our favorite Moroccan Palace!,Date of stay: August 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,Dubai,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DubaiHiggins

The guy waiting until we had checked in and showed us to departures.  Thats service. The best hotel i have ever stayed in  and i have traveled all over the world . Friendly staff who could not do enough for us from keeping the sun of my wife throughout the day to arranging a trip with a private car to the Atlas mountains . All restaurant bookings inside and outside the hotel all travel to and from anywhere we went all arranged. This is NOT a budget hotel 2 of the restaurants in the hotel have 2 Micheline stars each so you pay for top quality.  Every meal was £200 for 2 . Breakfast £78 for 2 . You get top quality food and service but you pay for it .

La Mamounia Marrakech,adlr wrote a review Oct 2013,50,Morocco luxury - beware of imitations,"We stayed here as we were in Marrakech for a wedding. From the moment you enter leaving the dusty streets behind you you realise this place is special.    We checked into a park view room on the second floor. It has an amazing view over the gardens and although the balcony is large you dont feel exposed.    The room is very well appointed with everything you would expect from this level of hotel plus a very good light system. The only channels on TV however are news and some basic sports with no movie or entertainment options. The wireless internet connection is excellent you can stream with no problems so bring options (ipad etc) with you if you like to watch a bit of somthing other than the BBC.    Food - breakfast buffet is perfect with everything you could want. There are three restaurants and a bar you can eat at during the day. The buffet lunch is outstanding and i highly recommend it.    Now back to the title i gave this review. We had a huge number of friends staying at various hotels and riads inside and just outside Marrakech. We heard lots of horror stories of places 40 mins away from the center or food poisoning flies and cockroaches. None of these probelms exsist at this hotel. The place is spotless and cleaned relentlessly by an army of staff. We had freinds that moved hotel to this one after coming to see it.    If your budget can handle it do not hestiate it will change your experience of this city for the better. We will be coming back.    PS not for children.    PPS when you order a taxi ask the hotel staff how much you should pay AND MAKE SURE THE DRIVER KNOWS WHERE HE IS GOING. They will say ""yes"" at least three times before they admit they dont know where you are going.",Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adlr
La Mamounia Marrakech,Sophie P wrote a review Oct 2013,50,The flawless La Mamounia,I really cannot fault La Mamounia it is made of beautiful architecture and luxurious furniture. The grounds are so peaceful and perfectly looked after which is a vast contrast to Marrakech centre. The hotel deserves the 5 stars.    The hotel provided us with a beautiful room with outstanding finishing touches fresh cakes everyday fresh fruits and waters throughout our stay. The staff could not of been more welcoming and accommodating the general cleanness of the hotel is worth noting. And we enjoyed a lovely breakfast by the pool on the mornings.    The only downside is the price of food and drinks in the hotel having stayed at many 5 star deluxe hotels I am aware of the prices of a cocktail. It was £19 and the breakfast was £39 per person at La Mamounia although it is clear you are paying for the incredible surroundings and atmosphere.    It is worth noting the architecture although exquisite is made up of steps and un-even surfaces which we noticed therefore if steps are an issue this hotel probably isn't for you.,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leeds, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/256sophiep

La Mamounia Marrakech,BermudaVisitor wrote a review Sep 2013,50,Stunning and Unique,The physical plant of La Mamounia is almost impossible to replicate. The ceiling in our suite both near the entrance and in the lounge area was of unrivaled workmanship. The room layout is superb and all the small touches are of exceptional quality. Our sons room was of the same calibre (but there is no facility for single beds).  The spa was magical and the experience worthwhile. The restaurants (Italian at lunchMoroccan in the evening and Pool at breakfast) were lovely although the service was not as swift nor personalised as the rest of the hotel nor indeed does the food represent value for money. Most other hotels of this calibre will always refer to guests by name but this was not the case in the restaurants perhaps the sheer turnover makes it difficult.    The grounds are lovely with boule tennis exercise room and glorious outdoor pool; there is an equally beautiful indoor pool in the spa area.    We were only there for a night but would return for a second visit to what is an exceptionally beautiful and unique hotel.

But since it reopened (after a 3 year renovation) it managed to take luxury experience to a new level.  The rooms are magnificent (garden view suites are perfect with kids) the pool is out of this world the gardens extraordinary the restaurants and bar all great (love the Churchill bar) the spa certainly one of the very best in the world...and the staff well makes you feel at home really. Even if you are a first comer and not a A-lister (and they are plenty there !) and even if your 6 year old daughter is a noisy at times...!  The pick up at the airport in Range Rover is really nice (a 15' drive so much better than the 1+ hour to the Palmeraie hotels) the Souk and the Medina are just a short walk away...it does not get better than that !

La Mamounia Marrakech,melmay wrote a review Sep 2013,50,Incredible Wedding,We had our wedding at La Mamounia last Saturday and the only word I can use is INCREDIBLE. I had briefly visited the hotel 2 years ago and was blown away by its beauty. The staff are wonderful and really do take care of your every wish. I was asking for all sorts of things like dress pressing golf buggies more lighting and everything was provided to perfection with a smile. On arrival in our room was a bottle of laurent perrier on ice an array of fresh fruit and pastries and a hand written note from the director as well as the standard things for all guests like the beautiful toiletries moroccan slippers flip flops pen etc We had our ceremony in the gardens which was set up like a fairy tale and then our reception in Le Marocain tent which was like something out of Arabian Nights. Each one of our 30 guests were blown away by the hotel- it really does have the 'wow' factor. Paul McCartney had just checked out when we arrived hey if it's good enough for a Beatle!! Of course this place is not cheap but in my opinion you get what you pay for. If you want to feel like royalty for a few days and have the best service in the world in the most beautiful hotel and in one of the most interesting places- you must visit!! It is a welcome haven from the wonderful madness of marrackech! I can't recommend this place highly enough.

La Mamounia Marrakech,CJ827 wrote a review Sep 2013,50,Luxe and Grandeur!,I had apprehensions before travelling to Marrakech on the choice of La Mamounia because of the mixed reviews I have read from both Tripadvisor and other luxury travel Blogs/online magazines. Before actually arriving I said to myself.. there is only one way to find out..    My partner and I booked a pick up service and indeed a representative was available at the arrivals hall and immediately took care of our luggage on the way to the parked car.    Once we arrived at the Hotel I knew at once that we made the right choice and was happy that we did not Change the property. We were greeted by a Lady who introduced herself as the customer service manager and escorted us to have a seat while she took our passports and check on the availability of the room. When she was back she informed us that the room alloted for us was not available and that could last a couple of hours. My partner then inquired if we could take a tour of the property and she happily obliged and walked us around and showed us the spa the pool the different restaurants etc.    I felt the grandeur and the history of the property whilst walking around and imagined all the guests that it had previously hosted. The lobby was a bit dark but it felt welcoming. While waiting a gentleman with a bowlful of dates and milk jug came and offered us to have our first taste of Morocco. I loved the date and the almond milk combination.    We had an Agdal Deluxe room which was supposed to have the Atlas mountain view but sandy air refused us this opportunity for the whole duration of our stay. We were happy of the pool view though. The room had all the amenities that one woudl expect from a typical luxury hotel. marble baths plush pillows.. the works.    We also made full utilization of the hotel concierge and he was more than happy to recommend us where eat booked a walking tour hailed a caleche etc etc for us. I could only say that he was the one of the best concierge service we ever had. (He even booked us a walking guide who was also guided almost all the American presidents and Hollywood celebrities who visited the city.)    Breakfast buffet was served by the pool and there were endless choice of pastries cold cuts typical moroccan dishes fruits and the usual trimmings. Hosts were attentive in anticipating and responding to our needs (replacing cutleries and china on time).    Location wise it was a perfect short stroll to the hustle and bustle of the Medina. It was soo calming to come back to the hotel and smell its perfumed lobby after a long day/night walk around the souks.    I celebrated my birthday dinner at the Moroccan restaurant of La Mamounia and ordered a Moroccan menu which was scrumptuous. If I remember correctly there was like 7 courses of almost all main course servings! Ambiance was perfect with accompanying local musicians playing traditional instruments and later on serenaded each table.    Upon departure we again booked a hotel car to the airport. What amazed me was that our chauffuer even went with us to check-in and filled up the departure forms for us and assisted us to change back our money from the bank. He made sure that we had everything we needed before leaving. Talking about service deluxe!    Only 2 little things to watch out for - the pricey alcohol cocktails in all the bars at the hotel(at least 20EUR per drink) and the annoying security guards outside always asking if we were guests at the hotel. Otherwise everything at La Mamounia were as promised.,Date of stay: August 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Frankfurt, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CJ827

La Mamounia Marrakech,Andreia Miranda wrote a review Aug 2013,50,Perfect in so many ways: an oasis in Marrakech,Stayed there for 3 days and was amazed since the moment I first walked in.  The sumptuous decoration looking just like an arabic palace bringing out the best of the local arquitecture is irresistible! It might not be everyone's cup of tea but it's certainly worth a look. And another plus: it's just located at one of the entrances of the medina and you can walk to the main square Jeema El-Fna in 10 minutes and enjoy the lively and crazy ambiance.    Service was always impecable with a quiet but very attentive staff. Always ready to help you out (of course you feel like you have to tip a lot too) but not toooooo helpful giving you some space to chill without being on your back all the time. Maybe due to the time of year - August is not the most popular month for a visit since temperatures often rise to 45º C or more - but all the hotel was quite calm and you could be at the pool area enjoying in silence. The rooms are beautiful and spacious enough and every day you would have water and fresh fruit at your disposal and a little sweet treat at night. Something you would expect from a 5 star hotel but maybe not with all the exquisite presentation.    The only minus would go to the restaurants and pool bar.  We only had a meal at the Italian and the prices go off the roof if you compare them with a nice meal in any of the 'a la mode' restaurants at Hivernage or any other chic area. Not even comparing with the veryyyy cheap prices of other places at the Medina.  We were told that the restaurant had a Michelin star so that might have explained the high prices but the experience was ruined with a really hard to chew meat - that's unacceptable in such a place.  All the other meals were made out of the hotel and we had the chance to try out all the traditional dishes in style.  Also cocktails at the pool and simple sandwiches are incredibly expensive.  On the good side breakfast is very good with a wide selection and all the 'must haves' of an hotel of this category.    On the overall if you can afford it go for it because it gives you an unique and luxurious experience that truly made our stay in Marrakech much more enjoyable.,Date of stay: August 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Matosinhos, Portugal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andreia1010

Make sure upon entering any room at La Mamounia to understand exactly how the lights in the room work. Not knowing how it works can ruin your stay at the hotel.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Will T wrote a review Aug 2013,50,Why is this not #1?,"If there was a six-star option that's what I'd give La Mamounia. We've stayed at some other great hotels but this was the best. Some highlights:    1) Service: It was pretty cool being greeted on the way in and out by a handful of uniformed smiling doormen (one wearing a cape?!). But what set LM apart from the other 5-stars like most Four Season Ritz Carlton and even Mandarin Oriental hotels service-wise was the willingness of the concierge and staff to go the extra mile. For example my wife left her contact lens solution in the desert and we realized this in our room around midnight. We called down expecting ""sorry we don't have that"" but instead the concierge went to several pharmacies to procure the lens cleaner and delivered it to us 30 minutes later. The staff also brought cardboard boxes up to our room because we bought many items that couldn't fit in our luggage and we were going to mail them. If I ever asked for something (and admittedly I asked for a lot!) there was never any hesitation or pushback from the staff. We tipped a lot so that always helps but all the staff seemed so friendly and genuine when helping out. It was like we were in some fantasy land where anything we wanted the hotel would provide (without making you work to explain or justify). In addition to these more-difficult tasks they handled the easy stuff well too (dinner reservations).    2) Decor & Style: I can't do justice to how amazing this place looks inside and out. Just Google search ""La Mamounia Style"" and read what the experts say.    3) Rooms: Spacious and very cool design. Every morning there would be fresh fruit - and out of the ordinary (no apples bananas pears or hard to cut fruits). Peaches the first day red raspberries (like a whole carton) the second day.    4) Spa/Pool: Again design and service reign supreme. Did the hammam treatment which was pretty cool. The huge infinity pool is awesome.    5) Value: Travel in the off-season and you can pay 4400 dirham for low season rate. Taking in mind the world-class service I consider this to be a great deal. Of course the food and drink is ridiculously expensive but that's the same everywhere. At least you can venture out of the hotel and the concierge will make reservations on your behalf.",Date of stay: August 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Charlotte, North Carolina",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/willthach
La Mamounia Marrakech,T_Edwards_11 wrote a review Aug 2013,50,Grand imperial hotel offering a luxurious and peaceful escape!,My boyfriend and I spent a wonderful four nights at the fabulous La Mamounia. La Mamounia is a beautiful hotel located just ten minutes walk from the centre of Marrakech. It's situated with close proximity to the main square but manages to find it's own tranquil space within Medina walls a unique quality rarely found in central Marrakech. The hotel and rooms have been finished to a very high standard with a number of restaurants and facilities available. The swimming pool was the perfect peaceful place to escape the July heat until late afternoon when exploring the town was more appealing. The service was excellent and staff were very friendly and helpful at all times. We didn't eat dinner at the hotel as there were far too many tempting local options but breakfast was excellent if pricey.    The hotel is large but despite this the personal attention we received was second to none. Fresh fruit every afternoon brought to the room small cakes/biscuits in the evening ... great attention to detail. However if you are looking for a small boutique hotel this may not be for you. I would recommend La Mamounia for anyone wanting a luxurious break from the hustle bustle and heat of Marrakech!,Date of stay: July 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T_Edwards_11
La Mamounia Marrakech,BOB S wrote a review Aug 2013,50,"A beautiful, pleasant experience",We did not stay at this hotel but spent a good half day here on the recommendation of the concierge at our Riad.    After a trek to the Majorelle gardens on a hot sultry day we ended up at the doors of La Mamounia to get a drink on our way back to the Riad we were staying at in the Medina in Marrakech. At first the liveried stewards at the door were a bit reluctant to let us in  because we (a family of four with two boys 19 13 years old) were all in shorts. (By the way we discovered after being sold a package by BA that August is low season HOT and not the time to go to Marrakech! anyway...) But we smiled and they let us in after a brief chat...    The colours and decor of the hotel may not be everyone's taste but the architecture the workmanship and the opulence is AMAZING. I've travelled on business worldwide for more than 20 years and this is definitely one of the more delicate caring and exquisite restorations of a traditional hotel I have ever seen.    We were led to a restaurant that was open at the time and there were only three occupied tables. The service was so good we decided to order lunch. The service was unhurried polite and attentive - they catered to many requests for sauces etc and to be honest by UK standards it was not that expensive - for a three course meal for four with a drink each we paid under 1500 Dirhams or about £120 - we could have easily spent that in an average Westend restaurant in London.    After lunch (which lasted about 2.5 hours!) the staff encouraged us to take a tour of the facilities. The pool was inviting and BIG - but unfortunately we did not have our swimming gear. The highlight were the gardens - about 30 acres of lawns and beds divided by gravel pathways. It smelled lush and fresh - the beds had every herb you would ever use including rosemary thyme and several indigenous ones. In the middle of the gardens is a shaded ice cream bar where we settled down again and had ice cream and a drink. There was a sand pit nearby where a French family was playing boules. At the far end there were numerous fruit and vegetable shrubs and trees - fresh pomegranate oranges apples aubergine courgettes mint carrots....    I believe Winston Churchill loved this place and the bar is named after him here. Its all very civilised and pukka!    Having got there at lunch time the sun was thinking of setting by the time we finally made our way out of the hotel - reluctantly - hailed a horse-drawn carriage back to the Medina riding along a road lined with olive trees.

She said Mark you'll love it. Ok book it.    Not really sure what I'd done or why I went along with it.    Arriving at Marrakech airport I was greater by one of their chauffeurs in a Damler. He was very courteous chilled bottle of water at the ready; greatly appreciated as passport control was very busy.    On arriving at the hotel I was absolutely awestruck at its beauty it really was a lesson in how to light a building and gardens! The guest relations manager greater me with a traditional Moroccan welcome with Almond Milk and dates followed by a tour of the hotel. It was simply stunning.    Once I'd had chance to settle into my room I went exploring. Everything was perfect the ambience was something to behold. Every single member of staff stopped and said hello.    Once I'd explored a bit I settled on the Italian terrace for the best Aperol Spritz I'd ever had. The surroundings are once again sublime. The lanterns and lighting are just lovely.    Well done to all concerned La Mamounia is a triumph. The only negative point I'd the cost of things whilst you are there. If money is no object then fine. If you're a working man such as myself £20 for a cocktail is steep!,Date of stay: August 2013,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markpV640HI
La Mamounia Marrakech,Becky W wrote a review Aug 2013,50,Amazing Hotel,On a family holiday to Morocco we stayed at the hotel for 4 nights which was brilliant. The hotel is located near the hustle and bustle of the souks but within its walls it is a tranquil and relaxing place. The service at all times was impeccable and very attentive. The rooms were on the small side and the lack of bright lights made the place rather dark but gave the place a certain atmosphere. The beds were large and extremely comfortable. The rooms were cleaned twice a day to the highest standard and the beds turned down with water replenished and snacks provided. The food was incredible- the Moroccan restaurant had a brilliant 'sharing salad' with an array of dishes and live traditional music and the Italian provided exquisite food and service. Breakfast was the best! Lots and lots of choice and of the highest quality. Despite being pricey the incredible service made it one of the best hotels and holidays ever. 100% recommended!,Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Royal Tunbridge Wells, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/311beckyw
La Mamounia Marrakech,Davis123 wrote a review Jul 2013,50,"Fantastic, like a fairy tale",This is an old world grand hotel probably one of the best. Set in a beautiful magical garden right in the middle of Marrakech yet quiet and relaxing. The whole hotel feels like a museum with art deco combined with Moroccan: beautiful tiling & luxury in the indoor pool & Jacuzzi which feels like a spa but is part of the hotel and completely empty; lovely art everywhere; art deco ceilings and details. The staff was incredible very nice to our children and friendly all around. Yes the food and drinks are very expensive! But room service is wonderful and the quality of the food is very high. Pool is beautiful and the breakfast is right next to the pool - fantastic spread of cakes breads meats Moroccan baked goods fresh juices. One of the best breakfast buffets I've experienced. It felt like being in a fairy tale to stay here for a few nights.,Date of stay: July 2013,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Leiden, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Davis123
La Mamounia Marrakech,Serial_Traveller wrote a review Jul 2013,20,A Charmless Hotel Resting On a Past Reputation With Added Food Poisoning.,.  We have been putting off staying at La Mamounia for many years instead preferring to try a variety of riads and other hotels in Marrakech. We were also concerned about some of the less positive reviews on TripAdvisor. Oh how we hoped the less positive ones were wrong but they aren't. I really hoped I was going to be writing a great review for one of the most expensive hotels in Marrakech. But what a waste of money - and food poisoning too!    We were certainly pleased to finally see what this famous hotel is all about - but we are left rather empty. For sure it's a very nicely decorated hotel but not jaw-dropping. It certainly lacks any charm or charisma and the staff looked so bored and appear to have very little to do and can barely raise a smile. Our Katoubia deluxe room was very charming had a sense of history  but was very small considering the price paid. NB: few room rates include breakfast which works out at around £30 \ $40 per person. However its a pretty good buffet. Though as we both got food poisoning from it we obviously wished we'd avoided it. And despite me writing to inform the hotel we've been completely ignored.  AND let me make it clear we ONLY ate at La Mamounia.    We checked in for 2 nights and if all had been great we could have stayed on for another week. But there are far nicer places to stay in Marrakech which are far more deserving of our money so we left after our 2 nights.    There were five things that really stopped me wasting anymore money here:-    1/ On our first evening a maintenance man appeared out of nowhere to fix our TV. We  didn't know it wasn't working. And it appeared no one on reception knew what was  going on or why he was in our room. I was asked to leave a recorded message with 'customer  relations' - yet no one bothered to return my call. Finally an hour later our TV was working all the while we were trying to shower and get ready to go out for dinner with a stranger in the room.    2/ The clocks went back an hour 7 days ago yet no one at La Mamounia has had the common sense to change them. And even after me pointing this out to reception upon leaving the hotel still no one had bothered to change the clocks in our room    3/ We ordered some tea. What arrived was a luke warm pot of water with a silly little tea bag  which could not flavour a thimble full of water. We sent it back. But another luke  warm pot of water arrived. Why is it so hard for staff to not know how to make tea?  Does no one at management level teach them? And wouldn't you expect a  hotel at this level to offer real tea leaves and not a silly tea bag? Don't give guests  garbage and expect them to pay for it.    4/ In two days of being sat around the pool in over 40 degrees not once has a guest been given a bottle of water a cool face cloth - nothing. Am I the only person to think that's really strange? We haven't even been asked if we'd like to order a drink. I am finding it really  hard to think of a single hotel I have stayed at where I've never been offered a single thing.    5/ Obviously the fact we both got food poisoning after having breakfast stopped us wanting to eat here.    This is clearly a hotel resting on a past reputation. Now it's simply a faceless charmless building. The exterior is certainly nothing worth commenting on. The Interior is nice very dark but pretty forgettable. There was a strange irony in that we walked around the very lovely gardens one afternoon - and at the end of the garden is an enormous discarded  stained glass lamp which would have originally hung inside the hotel but is now smashed - a relic from the past - the glass just left broken on the gravel path. It's been like it for months if  not years as can be told by nature naturally distressing it. That smashed lamp is the real La Mamounia. And clearly the owners and staff have very little interest in it.    I don't know if we were really unlucky but the behaviour of quite a lot of guests different nationalities was appalling. Loud mouthed shouting people yelling their heads off around the pool. I suspect the hotel only had a 10% occupancy rate though they still manage to cram 200 chairs around the pool with no privacy at all. Yet we could here every obscenity and the appalling way some guests spoke to the staff.    So I am pleased to now have been to the famous La Mamounia. And I'm certainly not going to tell you to stay away. But I do suggest checking in for one night have look around and then spend your hard earned cash at a more deserving establishment where they are delighted to see you and make an effort to make sure you enjoy your stay. And hand-on-heart I can say we have stayed at some fabulously decorated and charming riads within the medina which far exceed anything you can expect at La Mamounia. La Mamounia simply takes your money  and gives you nothing in return.    There are moments in travel when you pick a very expensive hotel and view it as  a treat. If the hotel is good and they ensure you have a wonderful time you may  exceed your budget but you really wont care. Whereas La Mamounia manages to do the opposite - it gives you nothing so you make the decision to not spend a penny more than  you have to.    .,Date of stay: July 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Serial_Traveller
La Mamounia Marrakech,NomadGirl60 wrote a review Jul 2013,30,Beautiful looking hotel - shame about the guests and smoking,"We stayed elsewhere in Marrakech (La Maison Arabe - highly recommended) but chose to visit the famous Churchill Bar for a drink. It wasn't long however before we decided to push the boat out and stay for dinner at their Italian restaurant. Be prepare to be fleeced - an extremely expensive evening but no regrets as it was a fun evening - mostly - and we enjoyed our visit. It's a stunning looking hotel - we especially loved the interiors. A tad dark perhaps for some but we thought decadent and exotic - plush velvet in deep aubergine contrasted with rich gold lighting - loved it. The Churchill Bar is extraordinary. It opened at 7pm (not sure if this was later or normal time as it was Ramadan) and we were the only people there for at least half an hour. The interior boasted leopard skin prints with scarlet and black...a winning combination for a sultry jazz bar. Lovely background music (we were early so live music later on I assume) and we received excellent service despite staff observing Ramadan until 7.45pm - for which we were grateful although were sensitive to. Nevertheless we did enjoy fabulous cocktails served with delicious nibbles although possibly the most expensive drinks ever (£80 for 4). But they were beautifully presented and for the experience it was worth it. On to dinner - marred by two things: 1. Marrakech still allows people to smoke in restaurants - disappointing for those of us who would prefer food and wine without inhaling others' smoke. 2. Two revolting whining spoilt women who were spectacularly rude to the staff and overly loud. In fact have never seen such rudeness to staff who were (literally) bending over backwards to please them. Frankly it was embarrassing - while the women treated them as little more than dirt on their shoes while they proceeded to stare into their iPhones. They might have had money but they certainly lacked manners. Anyway....the service in the Italian restaurant was excellent - in fact superb and the food very good. Delicious wine but at a minimum of £100 per bottle it had to be really. The desserts were stunning. Could have returned for more of those alone. The exterior is worth a visit although the gardens aren't as ""knock-out"" as we thought they would be. Beautiful swimming pool mind you really special.

The decor and the layout have changed significantly (e.g. the former Le Marocain restaurant is now the indoor pool) and I find the lobby and reception area slightly dark. Not surprisingly the interior designer is Jacques Garcia - who is behind the Hôtel Costes in Paris for example. BUT the suites and riyads are stunning with beautiful and intricate moroccan details and the hotel gardens are as wonderful as they always were.

La Mamounia Marrakech,holidaychicLondon wrote a review Jul 2013,50,Huge oasis of luxury and calm,Excellent location just 10-15 mins walk to the square. All of the/ staff were fantastic. The lobby is grand and spacious as is the pool area. What a wonderful pool and very prompt pool service. We had a koutoubia view room - adequate size lovey bed and good sized balcony to ave an early evening drink. We ate in the French restaurant which was very nice. I had the lamb which was very good. The Churchill bar is gorgeous moody lighting red padded walls with black and white photos of all the greats like Nat King Cole.  Cons - well the sunbeds were a little tricky to put up and down with a stiff metal lever and they were positioned rather close together so bit tricky to put your bag beside.  Other than that - yes the prices are bit crazy we knew that they would be and they were the lunch buffet £55-£60 per head for lunch buffet which was salads selection of roast meats a tagging couscous salmon and some sweets local Cadablanca beer just under £9 and a burger was £25 french meal - 1 starter 2 mains 2 glasses of champagne and bottle of wine a coffee and mint tea - £225 just to give you a flavour. We ate out the other 3 evenings as there's plenty of choice. We would've had the half bottle of chamagne to have on our balcony but at £85 thought just bit too steep.,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/holidaychicLondon
La Mamounia Marrakech,Hawksforflag wrote a review Jul 2013,50,La Mamounia-indulgent and atmospheric experience,My wife and I initially booked for 3 nights in May but were enjoying our time so much we stayed an extra night and spent most our time actually within the confines of this oasis knowing we had several more days to experience the sights and sounds of Marrakech.Having never been to Marrakech we booked to stay at 3 different places with La Mamounia our first stop. The check in was very civilised and easy(thankfully as we had flown from Melbourne to Paris with a connecting flight thru to Marrakech.I have repressed the memory of how many hours that was) sitting in the majestic lobby on comfortable sofa eating the most luscious dates whilst sipping on cool almond milk and then being shown to our room and given an overview of what La Mamounia had to offer.Most people would find La Mamounia expensive but you are getting a unique and amazing overall experience not just a hotel room. On that basis despite the cost it still represents good bang for your buck.  Our room was beautifulthe public spaces as exotic as we had hoped and the gardens stunning and varied to walk around especially in the cool of the morning and at sunset(with a prior stop for an icecream at Bar Menzeh the little building located midpoint).The vegetable gardens at the very back which supply the hotel restaurants were good to see.  Staff were generally excellent and very attentive but getting a drink from the poolside staff was slower than it should be for a hotel of this standard.  The breakfast buffet was excellent with a great variety of breakfast staples as well as Moroccan favourites.We enjoyed a very leisurely start to each morning and didn't worry too much about lunch.  We had dinner each night at their Moroccan restaurant aptly named Le Marocain reasoning that we hadn't travelled this far to eat French or Italian despite whatever local twists may have been added to those cuisines.We dined under the stars at Le Marocain each night and tried different dishes.The food was superb and the ambiance enhanced by the live band playing traditional Moroccan tunes.  The gym which is housed in a large building next to the tennis courts(didn't see anyone actually playing) was well fitted out and the 2 times we went we were the only people there.  My wife and I both tried the Hamaam(a first for both of us) and whilst the treatment rooms were beautifully decorated and clean the actual treatment wasn't as traditional as we had hoped and the massage afterwards was just ok. Nevertheles i would recommend the Hammam as a good introduction (if slightly sanitised) to the experience but wouldn't do the same for the massage.Both were expensive but not more than you would expect them to be in a hotel of this standard.  Bar Churchill is visually stunning but despite the live music on offer unfortunately wasn't busy on the nights we were there.Bar Italien was always a bit livelier but still fairly quiet and we enjoyed a cocktail or two on the terrace both pre and post dinner.  Would love to return to La Mamounia someday and that is the best recommendation you can give.Don't forget the obligatory photo with the impressively attired doormen.,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Melbourne, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hawksforflag
La Mamounia Marrakech,bartelle wrote a review Jul 2013,50,Luxurious Splendour,My wife and I had a 3 night long weekend here to relax in the sunshine. Service was impeccable and the architecture particularly impressive. The hotel is set in 8 acres of immaculate grounds white flowering shrubs and flowers cactii and palms close to the hotel leading to fruit then vegetables at the end of the main walk. An army of gardeners and irrigation systems keep this in perfect order for a relaxing stroll. Beautiful mosaics and such detailed plasterwork and wood carving give every part of the hotel a luxurious feel.    The huge pool is perfect great buffet style breakfast and lunches served around the pool or on the terrace outside the Italian Restarant. We ate Italian on arrival but were tired from travelling had a great dinner in the French restaurant the next night- 3 types of fois-gras and a huge sole as a special between us and finished in the Moroccan for our last night; a great experience although this was our first Moroccan menu and we could have chosen better with experience. Everywhere there were lovely staff and perfect service. The local Moroccan rose and red wines were surprisingly good.    Our room (311) was a standard one but well equipped.    In short a great hotel for a break not cheap but this quality is rare. Transfers to and from airport (which is only 10 mins away) were in one of the hotel Jaguars and made that part of the journey simple.,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,worcestershire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bartelle

La Mamounia Marrakech,5starTravelnut wrote a review May 2013,10,Totally lacks charm & too expensive,I had so looked forward to staying at the legendary La Mamounia that I spent more for a 3-night stay here than at any other 5-star hotel. It was a total waste of money as it had the least charm of any 5-star hotel I had ever stayed at anywhere in the world.  Service was terrible. My husband & I were supposed to have a transfer from the Marrakech airport to the hotel but when our flight from Casablanca was cancelled by Royal Air Morocco (the worst airline in the world by the way) the hotel did not bother to find out what happened to us (we do not travel with cell phones.) The hotel sent a car only after we borrowed a stranger’s cell phone to call them & it took a while for reception to look up our confirmation. With the flight delay & transfer delay we missed a whole day in Marrakech & our hotel. Hurricane Sandy was making landfall at the same time in the US & we were so very worried about our home business friends & employees. We were terribly tired hungry & frustrated by our travel day & worried about Hurricane Sandy but received no word of understanding & got the stilted check-in ritual by a robotic beautiful hostess who could not speed up or deviate from her check-in script. We begged for an express check-in but to no avail. Only later we found out most guests hire a private car through the hotel for transfer from Casablanca rather than use the fickle & often delayed ½ hour RAM flight. Too bad the hotel did not advise us of that at the time of booking  The hotel is grand but cold & lacking charm. Our room was elegant but rather small. As per another review the master lighting console was ridiculously complicated—we never mastered it. There were no simple on-&-off switches or even normal dimmers. As a result the room was always dim. We could NEVER get the room bright enough for comfortable reading. The television had only 2 broadcast stations in English—one was Bloomberg financial & one was an international news station. We could get updates on hurricane Sandy thankfully but nothing to take our minds off of it. This became an issue as there were relentless torrential rains for our entire stay there so we were stuck in our rooms more than normal. Every other hotel we stayed at in Morocco had more English language stations than La Mamounia & these other hotels were not as exclusive.  La Mamounia is famous for their dramatically dressed doormen. However when we requested loaner umbrellas from them to venture out in the downpour we were told there was no such perk. This is the first time anywhere in the world where we were not provided loaner umbrellas at a 5 star hotel! Apparently guests come & go by private car. When we went for a walk with our hooded rain jackets & returned drenched we were challenged as to our being guests & had to show our key while continuing to get wet. This was a little insulting because during our check-in orientation we were advised that there was a dress code for the lobby & public areas & yet there were guests in their bathrobes in the Grand Lobby yelling across the entire length to one another in French. We asked our hostess how that could be acceptable: she said they were on their way to the spa. These guests weren’t bothered but we were simply because we came in from a walk in the rain.  We are more fitness oriented than spa oriented but the fitness center was in a separate building on the grounds & we got drenched getting there. Working out was out-of-the-question because it was so oppressively hot in the gym. The outdoor swimming pool was gorgeous but when it finally stopped raining I did not even consider swimming laps in it because there were dining tables along the pool & as a woman I would have felt too uncomfortable in a swimsuit so on display in a Muslim society with their very restrictive cultural dress taboos. NO ONE was in the water. It was very weird.  We never ate at the hotel because the restaurants were outrageously expensive. Every little thing was expensive. A simple bowl of rice from room service would have cost nearly $50 US. This was so incongruous with the overall cost of living in Marrakech. This made us feel like we were being gouged. Thank God our breakfasts were included. I would have hated to pay for them separately.  The famous grounds of La Mamounia were a total letdown. The grounds lie in a rectangular courtyard within high walls & have groves of small trees planted on a grid & there was a culinary herb garden as well. The city garden just outside the hotel is much larger & more beautiful with many blooming roses & a variety of plantings & groupings & walks.  We totally regretted our stay at La Mamounia.

The last time I was in Marrakech I wanted to go in for a cocktail but I was turned away at the door and advised to reserve a table for another evening. I now know that they do not usually take reservations for the bar and in hindsight I realise that I was turned away because I looked a little dishevelled from my day's sightseeing.    This time I put on a nice dress and my friend and I had no difficulty at the door. The hotel and it's environs are beautiful. We had a stroll around the stunning gardens taking in the pool tennis courts terraces and even the vegetable garden. Then we settled into a couple of comfortable chairs by the piano band in Churchill's Bar and gasped at the price of the drinks! ""Ah! Only one then!"" My 'Cosmohibiscus' cocktail was pricey at 160 dh (£12.50) but it was divine - with a crystalised violet in the bottom. Very clever. The olives and salted nuts were also top quality.    The bar was sumptuously furnished and the band played smooth jazz so the atmosphere was very relaxing. The service was impeccable and the female staff were all dressed in stunning kaftans. Every detail exuded class.    I've no doubt that this hotel is beyond the budget of most Moroccans and many visitors too but that's the point isn't it? It's a luxury hotel. We saw people on the terrace in shorts and bikinis but I assume they were guests. The hotel's website is very clear that there is a dress code for non-residents and that seemed fair enough.",Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Milton Keynes, UK",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissHoneyBee-UK
La Mamounia Marrakech,Roeland v wrote a review May 2013,50,"one of the best, class of its own",We have just returned from a wonderful stay in Marrakesh. And La Mamounia made this into the wonderful stay we experienced. From arrival to check out this hotel knows how to please its guests. It is one of the best hotels we have ever been to and my partner travels professionally to all parts of the world and is lucky enough to stay in some of the best.    At arrival you are immediately taken to the lounge by a perfectly English speaking person where you are welcomed with almond milk and a date of course after receiving a lavender scented wet towel to whipe your hands. Scent is one of the pleasant experiences at the hotel. The house scent is something of ceder woody lovely. You get a tour around the hotel and gardens and wow those gardens are magnificent. And again the smell is so good (orange blossom). The room we had was beautifully appointed ammenties great again with the house scent. Even the cupboards smell nice :)    Service is impeccable even if you want your room made at night it will not be a problem. Every day you receive other fresh fruit in your room a small pastry and complimentary water. As some reviewers noticed at the gate you are asked if you stay at the hotel but we have never found this unpleasant. Even when wearing sneakers shorts and t-shirts if you are a guest you are always welcome. I think it is a good thing that they are a little strict. The hotel is so amazingly beautiful that it would be run over by hoards of tourists if they would be more lenient. Part of the charm is that the atmosphere is serene the lights are low service is friendly with an overall oriental look and feel.    The pool area is another great thing the pool is huge ozone cleaned so no chloride. Service again is fantastic. Last thing I will mention is The Spa again beautifully appointed with great treatments. A must do when in the hotel.    Of course you pay for it but if you can afford it it's worth it. I see in the reviews some exagerated statements. Breakfast is around 30 euro's (but the choice is amazing) cappucino is around six. A big plate of strawberries at the pool will do nine. The French restaurant is pricey indeed but there are plenty options outside the hotel.    In short La Mamounia is a class of its own on this planet and we will definitely return.,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roelandv_12
La Mamounia Marrakech,HowieEmbry wrote a review May 2013,50,Interesting Hotel with so much History,This has to be one of the most beautiful hotels I have stayed at. The service is top drawer but at this this price it should be.    Lots of reviews complain about being hassled at the door or flat out refused entry. Yes being hassled at the front entry is a a bit of a nuisance but for security and added privacy I understand and I am happy they go the extra mile to keep lookie lous out. This property is spectacular and could easily be over run with non guests if not careful. Its a wonderful respite for the hustle and bustle of Marrakech.    If you are guest you are made to feel like a KING!    One things is a bit of a problem is dinning at the hotel is very expensive. So unless money is no issue be prepared for paying for your meals. I think we paid 70.00 for breakfast for each person everyday. Lunch buffet was 100.00 per person and dinner was off the charts. A coke out of the mini bar was about 9.00. I feel ripped off when they are 3.00    My partner and I shared a sandwich by the pool with a bottle of water and a beer the price was over 50.00.    We saw people turned away at the gate some said they had dinner reservations. Not sure if this was true. One night after being asked if we were hotel guests at the gate they also wanted to see our room key at the elevator. We were told that the hotel had VIP clients that night. They would not confirm who but we did see Candice Bergen arrive at the same time we did.    The King also owns another Hotel very close by.    Also be aware that everyone seems to be dressed to the nines. Though we were never turned away for not having a jacket or tie and might have been if we were not hotel guests. We were always made to feel welcomed.    Like so many five star hotels in Europe internet is free.

Have been back to Marrakech a few times over the years and the hotel had been closed for refurbishment. Wanted to see what it was like now it had re-opened and my husband and I visited it once again this time with family. Was advised beforehand that drinks would be expensive and yes they were . Gin and Tonic £20 or 210 Dirhams . I wanted a Bellini and cost was 320 Dirhams ! But boy was it a very nice Bellini ! The waiter came round with the bottles of drinks on a silver tray and poured them from there into glasses . Very personal service . Olives and nuts were also produced . In the background a man was playing on the piano and it was all very plush and swish . Had a quick look at the gardens and pool beforehand and was suitably impressed .

The setting is absolutely beautiful and very tranquil. The gardens were outstanding and were amazing to walk around. The pool area was glorious and reasonably well spaced out. We didn't spend much time in the spa so as to avoid missing the sunshine but did feel the staff to be overly-attentive which diminished the relaxing atmosphere a little. We chose to eat by the pool and it is very much an in for a penny in for a pound situation as even the water is pricey but the pool-side service was fantastic.,Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Edinburgh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Smilie_Traveller
La Mamounia Marrakech,George E wrote a review May 2013,50,Drinks on the terrace,We saw the Mamounia recommended in our guide book as one of the Worlds great old hotels and that non guests are welcomed. We found the hotel on the edge of the Medina ramparts behind La Koutoubia Mosque. There are flunkeys on the door but although the guide book advised long trousers and no t shirts there were plenty of people in shorts and t shirts who had just come to look at the gardens.  The building is impressive with a library style quietness dimly lit corridors and fountains - very colonial.  We had mint tea water and a beer on the rear terrace which was expensive at around £17/18 but we also had olives and lots of salted almonds and enjoyed nearly 2 hours of luxurious peace pretending that we could afford to stay there.  As an oasis of peace after the madness of the rest of Marrakech it is much recommended but please have the courtesy to buy a drink.,Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Dewsbury,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeE196

La Mamounia Marrakech,AnnSantaFe wrote a review Apr 2013,40,Pros and cons,We stayed in La Mamounia two nights and La Maison Arabe two nights. La Mamounia is a stunning hotel. Huge stylish gorgeous gardens the best pool area we've ever seen in the world. The best breakfast buffet in the world. Very good service. We had the deluxe room with balcony overlooking the gardens. The rooms are little fussy. Drapes over drapes over an electric blind. 8 pillows on the bed. A lot packed into a relatively small space. The lighting of the room is by a console but we could never figure out how to use it properly. There are even more buttons on the wall. Too complicated by half. The Spa was just ok. I had an uninspiring massage although my husband liked his. La Maison Arabe spa was much better and more beautiful.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Hawthorn37 wrote a review Apr 2013,50,"Stylish, relaxing, and an oasis in Marrakech","This is a truly stunning hotel; the location the ambience service and facilities nothing to fault. The gardens are lovely for long walks and with numerous areas to sit have a drink or food; and the hotel has an extensive range of bars restaurants and activities.    The rooms are spacious and the features are all traditional Moroccan with a modern stylish twist. The bed in our room was large and very comfortable with no 'bounce'. We stayed in a balcony room overlooking the gardens (this was the deluxe style room) and it seems that the higher you are the better the views from the balcony. The other front wing looks over the pool which is fine as its not noisy. The 'odd' numbered rooms which are 'classic' style appear to overlook the Spa area. The aircon works well and there are shutters to keep the heat out. The rooms are serviced twice daily with plenty of fresh towels and drinking water delivered. The only omission we found was no coffee/ tea making facility in the room so this needs to be via room service. A Nespresso maker or the like would have been nice.    You should plan on taking a leisurely breakfast served by the pool as the choice is staggering. Moroccan continental fresh fruit a massive range of baked products and hot food including eggs any way you like. The waiters are also ultra-attentive offering a full range of hot drinks - but not decaffeinated tea for some reason. We chose to eat out most of the time however the Italian restaurant was first class and the lounge bar and terrace was very nice for a lunch. We were also told that the French restaurant was good for a light lunch. You can also have light lunches by the pool with BBQ food etc.    We didn't try the Spa or treatments tennis courts boules area or the large gym but it all looked excellent. There is also table tennis in the gym and a chill out 'hamman' area. There are some shops in the hotel with a newspaper kiosk at the entrance which also sells medications sun lotion and giftware etc.    The gardens are large (very large) and filled with trees and flowers. The lawns are well kept and you can have sun beds positioned on the lawns in tranquillity. A walk in the evening is very relaxing and this is when the fragrances are at the best.    The location is convenient for the main square mosque and souk - all 15 minutes from the hotel. Just watch out for people ""just happening to be walking your way"" and ""hotel workers completing their shift"" with both types wanting a fee as a guide to the square. The concierge will organise transport if you want to go further or a real guide to show you to around and out of the souk plus other attractions in town.    Overall the hotel it extremely stylish with sumptuous public areas and very relaxing. The staff are very friendly and very numerous and we witnessed no cases of staff being rude as quoted in some reviews. We would have no problem returning or even calling in for dinner or afternoon tea.",Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Derby, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hawthorn37

Waitress fine very attentive we order nibbles that all went well after two hours we got hungry and thats when problems started. So in a 5 star hotel there shouldn't be problems with getting a table in an empty restaurant at 10pm. ? to cut a long story short the Manager was called he was rude and after an argument we finally got dinner.

The hotel is stunning the staff are attentive and the bar's luxurious. I'd done a bit of research before the holiday and I had heard incredible things about the Winston Churchill bar. Mood lighting leopard print and black fringing it is reminiscent of a brooding gentlemen's club. The cocktails are expensive (4 cocktails between us & a taxi ride home was about £70) but for the experience whilst in the city it is a must. We had a couple of amazing mojitos in the bar and wanting to explore further we were led (by recommendation of the staff) to the Italian Bar. Vastly different from the Churchill Bar we were transported to high ceilings intimate lighting & cosy booths.

The Hotel is Dark pretentious and over-priced considering the rooms are so small dark and difficult to work the lights. We had requested adjacent rooms for our children through our travel agent. When the hotel did not provide this they charged us 50 Euros per night for an upgrade we didn't want so we could have adjacent rooms plus an additional 80 euros per night so our 6 year old could sleep in our room instead of next door as he wasn't well. When challenged by our travel agent the hotel lied that we had requested this upgrade.    Very unhelpful and unaccommodating we didn't get to our rooms until 10.30pm even though we arrived at 8pm. They refused us any food unless we went to the formal restaurants we were only allowed room service. No thought for us and our unwell 6 year old what a terrible start to our holiday!    The food was lovely and the restaurants had great service but VERY OVERPRICED. One lunch for 4 sandwiches a bottle of water and one ice cream was £180. That is just ridiculous for a light lunch.  The pool was nice but nothing special. We will not be returning to this hotel. Luckily we went on to stay at the Taj Palace which was magnificent.

Marrakesh has many new and impressive modern hotels along with tons of traditional riads to choose from. La Mamounia stands out as old-style colonial and perhaps rarely for Morocco has retained and built upon the French virtues of dedicated service.    Truly polished and knowledgable maitre d' and waiters enhanced the experience of a lovely lunch in a setting once graced by royalty politicians and film stars (though they seemed absent when we visited).    Be aware that this restaurant comes with European haute cuisine prices - budget USD 100 ph for three courses at lunch with soft drinks!

If I was being picky I could say that the bathrooms were quite dark as the lighting was minimal but sitting on the balcony with a drink at sunset soon made me forget such a minor detail.  The hotel itself is located perfectly next to a beautiful park and only a 10 minute walk to the huge bustling markets however English speaking drivers are available at all hours of the day to take you wherever you need to go should it be further afield.  Good sized indoor and outdoor pool and the spa had a nice selection of treatments too.  Visited the Churchill bar one evening where they had a jazz singer who was excellent and even when I got too drunk and ended up naked in the hotel pool the staff were still friendly and polite to me even though clearly it wasn't the kind of place for that behaviour!

No waiting at check-in we were taken to the lounge and provided with dates and almond milk while completing the check-in process. Our suite was stunning with views across the immaculate gardens. We ate at three of the hotel's restaurants. On the first night we enjoyed a relaxed and delicious meal at Le Marocain complete with wandering musicians. On the second night we tried the French restaurant which was somewhat lacking in atmosphere. The meal was reasonable but not outstanding the exception being the calorific and magnificent chocolate soufflé. On our last night we had a memorable evening in the Italian restaurant simply perfect. The gym was perfectly situated in the centre of the gardens and made working out a visual treat.

La Mamounia Marrakech,2013Travel_Companion wrote a review Mar 2013,30,Only worth one visit & not worth the price,The Mamounia is excellent - as everyone will tell you. It is a stunning property close to the main square giving it the best location. It has beautiful gardens huge swimming pool and a comfortable heated swimming pool too. When you enter the Mamounia you feel the grandeur and pomp immediately. The staff and the guests - all walk around in style. The experience is unique and special and makes you feel very grand. The reason why I have stated it as average is given below.    For one the price they charge is too much for what they offer. Even though we wrote to them months in advance and stated that we were a honeymoon couple they made no concessions and offered us no incentives or anything special for the honeymoon couple. Further their very high price did not even include breakfast. Breakfast came at a very high additional price of 350 MAD - though the food was good it was not worth the price. At the price they charge breakfast should have been included - it is a mere basic. Of all the hotels we stayed at during our Honeymoon the Mamounia was the only one that offered us nothing additional for being a honeymoon couple which was very disappointing for us.    Another small problem we faced was that the person who came to clean our room he would throw away things that belonged to us. For example my almost over face cream packet and nutella jar. Both had a little left at the bottom - however the staff self-decided that he should discard this and he did! It was very annoying and nothing was done about it when we complained.    Food in the restaurants and the room service was excellent. The tagines we had at the Mamounia were by far the best. Their spa was simply fantastic and we went there twice during the 4 days we stayed there. The spa staff was super nice and friendly and the spa treatments were fantastic.

The traditional Moroccan musicians around the various places of the hotel followed the same quality. The gym at the heart of the gardens is world class. And the pastry shop is a must to drop in at least to see!!  Yes it is pricy but all worth it. If you can effort it do not hesitate.

We had a light lunch outside on the terrace 2 small bottles of water and one mozzarella panini total 430dhs (£35) which we thought was a lot. It was nice but I think you are being charged for where you are. Compared to The Four Seasons  Marrakech which is the same level of 5 star hotel I would rather stay there!,Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunseekerli123
La Mamounia Marrakech,xbombastic wrote a review Feb 2013,40,A Special Treat,We stayed just one night at La Mamounia and had a wonderful experience. We were in room 344 which was lovely views out over the garden and to the Atlas Mountains in the distance. We are LHW members and were upgraded to this room when we arrived and we were delighted to find a chilled bottle of champagne in the room when we were taken in. The room was very comfortable more or less an L shape with the long part being a lounge and the short bit the bedroom opening into an opulent (and huge) bathroom wall to wall marble deep clawfoot tub huge walk in shower and separate toilet and bidet. The room was opulent the service attentive and the attention to detail ensured we had a great experience. We had a room service dinner which was very good and enjoyed a drink at the Italian Bar. The only glitch was that the internet service was very poor and attention to addressing the problem was not great as I had to report the problem a second time before anyone came to have a look. Eventually the problem was blamed on Maroc Telecom which for all I know may have been true. All in all La Mamounia was a nice treat after a week in a rather more rustic setting.,Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Saint Thomas, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xbombastic

La Mamounia Marrakech,shy wrote a review Feb 2013,10,Mamounia is NOT client oriented any longer What a disgrace!,« I have been a regular & faithful client of the Mamounia Palace***** in Marrakech for over 60 years.  Minimum stay pro year is at least 3 weeks/year in a room or suite.  I have recently been extremely shocked and angered regarding an unfortunate incident: a few drops of wine were accidentally spilt on the carpet of my Suite (= 8600 Dirhams per night) resulting in a couple of small stains.  The hotel compelled me to buy off the whole carpet (10’800 Dirhams!) at its current value stating “boutique purchase” on my final invoice but additionally to pay for extra night charges claiming that the room could not be rented until the carpet had been replaced thus was un-saleable ! I have given the carpet to a local charity and paid off all the charges that were claimed by the hotel.  Never in my experience of travelling the world (which I have been doing for over 50 years) have I come across such an appalling attitude and from such a ‘reputable’ hotel especially since the damage was caused unintentionally and it was the first time I ever caused any damage at this place in 60 years.  This type of ‘damage’ should be covered by the Hotel’s Insurance policy and not born by the client ! I will not be returning to the Mamounia again. »  D.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Brian B wrote a review Feb 2013,50,The best,We regularly stay at five star hotels and have just returned from a week in La Mamounia Marrakech. It is one of the best we have stayed in. The service was excellent although it was quiet as we were there late January/ early February. The room was excellent with views across the large gardens. The food and wine was first class as you would expect from French and Italian restaurants each holding two Michelin stars. The Moroccan restaurant was also very good. If you want a luxury break in Marrakech within a gentle ten minute walk of the Medina this is the one.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Dina C wrote a review Feb 2013,20,Disappointing.,Having just returned from La Mamounia I feel compelled to write this review. This was my first trip to the hotel and sadly my last. The standard of food and service are not that of a five star hotel. Our room (Aqbal Delux) was pleasant however we were unable to open our terrace doors as the carpet was in the way and the lighting was poor. Considering the hotel has recently undergone a multi million pound refurbishment I was rather surprised. Our dinner in Le Morrocan restaurant was very disappointing. We were sat opposite a serving station food very average and ridiculously expensive. One glass of Champagne £30.00. Snacks by the pool were a disgrace a sandwich served on burn't toast with one key ingrediant missing. It was sent back twice cost £23.00 (approx) and no apology given. The Spa was average and the staff offhand.

Having visited the Jardins Majorelle (disappointing) and walked for miles trying to find somewhere nice for lunch I snapped bundled hubby into a cab and high-tailed it to La Mamounia!  How pleased I am that we did! We decided to forgoe the Sunday brunch at £100 per head and opted for a meal on the terrace. We had a blissful beer and gin and tonic (nectar!) and a lovely cheeseburger in a beautiful peaceful garden setting with smiling and attentive staff. It was such a change from what we had experienced in the rest of Marrakech that we stayed all afternoon! £75 well spent.

Historic hotel well cared for but as with many historic property there's a little ""resting on their laurels"" aspect going on here. Basic rooms are quite basic but if you can splurge a bit the suites are wonderful. Grounds are TO DIE FOR and a DEEP old school pool is cool refreshing and luxurious. The PROPERTY will not disappoint.    I would NOT recommend this hotel for first timers though. It is a long taxi ride to the medina and Jemaa el Fna. Also the Arabic service habits are over the top here. With this I mean the HAND OUT for a tip at EVERY TURN can be overwhelming here. When u arrive the deliver a basket of fruit and they wait around for a tip. 2 minutes later a knock on the door with fresh towels with a hand out a few minutes more someone comes by with some water again waits for a tip. This normal in this culture they'll keep coming until you stop tipping but at La Manmounia its too much.

A whole hour and a hald wasted waiting for the staff to get their act together. The rooms are lovely but the Deluxe rooms are small for two. They are beautifully done. The junior suites are much nicer especially on a higher floor overlooking the pool over to the Atlas mountains. Avoid the street side which is noisy. Service is patchy - at times great (at the pool restaurant) at times painfully slow (at the bar)- but all in all staff is very friendly if not always sure what they are doing. The Mamounia gardens are legendary and rightly so. Check out the tea pavillion and walk along the paths. The pool is exquisite and the pool restaurant for breakfast and lunch is truly exceptional.

La Mamounia Marrakech,BluebellChloe wrote a review Nov 2012,50,"Yes it's expensive, but worth it!",Just had four nights at la mamounia and felt very blessed to be able to stay there.  Thankfully we upgraded our room on arrival as the first one offered overlooked the very noisy road to a room with a balcony and garden and atlas mountain view definitely worth the extra spend.  Our first morning was spent taking breakfast by the lake sized swimming pool and a very nice way to kick the day off. Breakfast didn't disappoint with vast choices of fresh fruit pastries breads cold meats cheeses and of course eggs and bacon too. We then went on a half day tour of Marrakech with a la mamounia guide. This could have been so great but sadly the only disappointing part of our stay. Our guide Ben was lovely but seemed more intent on taking us to his 'mates' shops who tried their hardest to sell us carpets and tables that we had zero interest in. All we wanted to do was see the sights! But sadly we spent most of our time inside shops feeling gulilty and embarrased that we were not buying. This is pretty standard practise in marakesh but I would have expected a guide from la mamounia to be a bit different.  On a more positive note we spent a fantastic few hours with one of the head chefs who showed us not only how to cook but took us on a tour down under. Because at la mamounia all the activity is down below with most of the 700 staff busily beavering away cooking doing laundry and so on. At la mamounia they make everything their own bread yoghurt cakes croissants jams ice cream stocks etc.  I also really enjoyed the spa had my first hamman ever which was an experience and one of the best massages I've ever had.  On a final note the staff and service is the best I've ever experienced what a lovely lot they are.

Our room was great too in the main ground floor corridor no problems at all. The Churchill Bar was good as was the normal bar and the Italian restaurant.

La Mamounia Marrakech,MtnWill wrote a review Oct 2012,20,"Enchanting Place & Magical Gardens, Poorly-Designed Rooms & Terrible Service!","La Mamounia is without a doubt a supremely magical place. It is certainly worth a visit if you happen to be in Marrakech. Stop in a get a drink at the bar or walk the gardens which are beautiful. Staying there however is absolutely not worth the price!    I just finished a 4-night stay at the hotel. The rooms while very unusual and certainly Moroccan in design are cold dark and uncomfortable. It takes at least a Master's degree to figure out the 1980-aged panel of buttons which control the television sound and lights (PhD preferred!). Even after four nights I was trying multiple combinations and just hoping that at some point I would get the correct combination to dim brighten or turn on or off the lamps.  What makes this place get a ""poor"" rating however isn't the labrynth-like dark hallways or the perfect IQ required to manage the lighting: It is the completely un-thinking staff that works there. These people are simply over-trained to the point that they are robotic and irritating!    Examples: Exiting the hotel I accidentally walked to a gate that must be reserved for employees or something. The guard there made me walk 15 minutes back to a ""proper exit"" even though his gate was wide open. A few minutes later I walked past him on the outside of the building and he smiled at me. (Note to the guard: Guests that pay more than $400 a night should be allowed to exit wherever they please!) At breakfast one morning the waiters insisted that we were not allowed to have an extra person join our table by pulling up an extra chair. (Note to the waiters: Guests that pay more than $400 a night should be allowed to eat with whomever they please even if it means moving your chairs around the pool deck!) I had an employee snatch a plate from me at the buffet and replace it with a bowl with the instruction ""Guests must eat fruit from a bowl"". (Note to man at Breakfast Buffet: Well you all get the picture....) It's like having your obsessive kindergarten teacher there with you on an ultra-expensive adult vacation.    I would not stay at La Mamounia again because of the way that the staff does not even think about what makes sense and simply acts upon what has been engrained in their training. (I wonder if they use electric-shock therapy to ""improve"" performance??) There are simply too many other wonderful choices in Marrakech to spend that kind of money and be treated that way! Oh - and if you do stop in for a drink just be prepared for the bill! A drink can easily be $30 USD and don't do anything to stretch the staff into thinking about what might actually make sense!

La Mamounia Marrakech,TopTripie wrote a review Oct 2012,50,La Mamounia - you can see why Winston Churchill insisted on staying here.,Fresh from a multi million pound restoration the Hotel and gardens are delightful.  The welcome is just what you'd expect from a classic five star hotel.  We opted for cocktails in the outside gardens on a lovely warm Marrakech evening.  The lavish and vast gardens are worth exploring by day and by night.  The Martini was perfect but for the second round of drinks we opted to go inside and  listen to the piano trio playing light jazz music. The trio played well and at a volume that did not intrude on atmosphere or concentration. The hotel was not busy at all so there was an air of exclusivity and privacy. More than highly recommended for a five star stay eating drinking and experience.,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled on business,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TopTripie

La Mamounia Marrakech,mshbnyehud wrote a review Oct 2012,40,"Exceptional property and service, but wow is it expensive!","My first visit to La Mamounia Hotel in Marrakech was extremely memorable on many counts not the least of which is how off-the-charts expensive it is. Not for the faint of heart when it comes to adding to your credit card! I rate the hotel highly but not at the top because of some issues which need to be resolved. First let me share the really great points of this hotel:    1) It is well located to the Medina just a 10 minute walk away.  2) The property as others have noted is simply magnificent. The grounds are gorgeous and one can find beauty and solitude in many places here.  3) Service is simply over-the-top. The hotel is loaded with staff offering to assist in so many ways with no expectation of tipping (although it is nice and perfectly appropriate to do some tipping). They are warm and so very hospitable.  4) Food is wonderful. Daily breakfast buffets are generous served pool side (weather permitting) and worth a lengthy visit. There are so many delightful choices of both healthy and not so healthy items. Everything tasted delicious. I also ate at the Italian Restaurant hotel and was fortunate that the Executive Chef Don Alfanso was ""in the house"" while we were there. He personally came by each table two times (!) to greet us and make sure everything was just right. We felt like royalty!  5) All of the sports/fitness facilities are exceptionally well maintained and modernized with no cost associated (unless you pursue special treatments or classes). The equipment was first rate.    On the other hand I feel that the hotel needs to improve in a few ways in order to get highest ranking:    1) Wifi is not strong or high speed. I travel now only with an iPad and no PC. So ethernet hookup was not an option and wifi was inconsistent. I lost valuable busniess productivity time because of this.  2) The bellman (at least in my case) needs to do a better and more understandable job of explaining all of the different buttons and gadgets in each room in English. If I knew French it wouldn't have been a problem. Thus when I thought that I had an air conditioning problem it was only because a very simple explanation of how the system works was not provided upon the first entry into the room.  3) I did have signal problems with my TV particularly with some music stations. It's nice to have the ability to take a hot bath in the delightful bathroom and immerse yourself in the situation with classical music playing on the ceiling speaker (from the TV) but if the music signal isn't working forget it.  4) The hotel is dark -- some people like how dark the rooms are and the lighting ambience. At times I wanted more light.  5) My room was as mentioned by others quite small but well appointed. At least I had a small balcony to escape to.    My initial reaction upon arriving and beginning to experience La Mamounia was ""this is the best hotel I've ever stayed at"". In the end it could have been but for a few weaknesses that are easily remedied. But of course for the value of money paid in all aspects there isn't high value here. You pay excessively in all respects. If that isn't a concern all in all La Mamounia is definately worth a visit.",Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Dallas, Texas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mshbnyehud

We spent the first two nights at La Mamounia then two nights at Kasbah Tamadot and the final night at Maison MK.    My last visit to La Mamounia was in the weeks before it closed for what would be an almost three-year renovation. The result of the renovations is magical- our room was large and functional and retained the feel of before the renovation; we were down the hall from the Churchill Suite.    I am a member of Leader's Club so I received an upgrade welcome gift and breakfast.    Management placed an amazing truly amazing chocolate (birthday) cake with champagne in our room. In advance by email I had communicated with the concierge regarding ground transportation activities and to accept an olive oil delivery in advance of my arrival. No problem. I had emailed the spa manager to confirm and then make some changes to spa treatments. No problem. Every member of the staff tried to be of assistance...    Laundry was taken and returned very quickly. Most staff used my name when greeting me. Everyone was smiling and asking if I needed anything. I did share gratuities in a generous manner; and I know that they were appreciated- it's often not how much is offered but the offer that means much.    If you treat the staff as you would your friends; respecting the efforts that they make on your behalf recognizing that some days are stressful.... then you will have a wonderful time at a wonderful place.,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Buffalo, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnKavulich
La Mamounia Marrakech,Veronica_Calgary wrote a review Oct 2012,40,Fall Day Pass with Lunch and Spa treatment,"I just returned from a trip to Marrakech with a friend and we spent a full day at the Mamounia Hotel on their ""Fall Day Pass"" for 1500 dirhams (about $180 US). I would highly recommend this for anyone staying in the area for a day of relaxation in beautiful surroundings. The lunch was absolutely wonderful and the service in the French Restaurant was excellent. The Day Pass includes the use of the public gardens spa facilities pools and one treatment - Hammam or Massage. We opted to add the other treatment at an additional 1000 dirhams (about $120). This was a mistake - as we found both treatments rather subpar after having the same treatments at the guest house we were staying at the following week of our trip (Hammam and Massage for only 800 dirhams).  Bottom line: I would have rated the Day Pass at 5 stars if the treatments had been better - but everything else was amazing and a truly great value - if you do the fall day pass opt for the Hammam - it's a little better than the massage which my friend and I both thought were the ""lamest"" massages we've ever had.

La Mamounia Marrakech,miatango wrote a review Oct 2012,30,A Major Disappointment,A beautiful hotel with good service; an island of tranquility in a hectic city. What's not to like?    Well the pricing is ridiculous for both lodging and food. The classic rooms while very attractive and atmospheric are impractical. One cannot use the toilet with the bathroom door closed but must let feet and knees protrude into the hallway. The sophisticated room lighting system means that turning on the bathroom light in the middle of the night automatically illuminates every lamp in the suite! Opening a closet door renders the hallway impassable. The shower has neither door nor curtain with the result that the floor of the bathroom becomes a puddle with each use.    The public areas and gardens are beautiful. Perhaps the higher-category rooms are more satisfactory but at roughly USD 600 per night I expected more in terms of accomodations.,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Miami, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miatango

The staff at the hotel is very profesional and helpful. I've read negative reviews  but noticed that ( many times) they were written by people who didn't stay at the hotel ( should this be permtted ? ). Previously I stayed at the ""Palais Namaskar "" ( see my review there ). I thought that I could compare both hotels but you can't. They are both very diferent. Anyway I like the fact that there is very good security at the hotel ( I see the fact that the hotel turns people away who are not guests as a positive thing). Had dinner at the Italian Restaurant . The food was excellent . Please take note that smoking is allowed in the restaurant but the capitan moved us to another table with no problem when another guest next to us had a cigarette . There was no problem at all. We had a great dinner . The pool is great . The room was  in my opinion beautiful. The room was made twice a day . This place is where one goes to have a fine vacation not to save money . Food & drinks do cost more that the outside  but this is true for any fine hotel in the world.

La Mamounia Marrakech,sfvoyage wrote a review Sep 2012,40,Unique ambiance and above average service,"I recently had a 4-night stay at this legendary property and its decor and ambiance was unique and special: a great blend of traditional Moroccan and contemporary style. Room was not big but very well appointed. Service while good did not measure up to similar class of top Asian hotels.    My biggest issue was with the wifi connection which was problematic throughout my stay working for maybe 2-3 minutes before stopping. I called for help every day but the resolution was temporary and one day was just told that there was a problem not just in the hotel but in the surrounding area. On the last day another technician came to my room with a router/signal amplifier which didn't solve the problem. After another 10 minutes he finally decided to hook up my laptop via a cable which finally solved the problem. He told me wifi in this hotel is always problematic especially if lots of guests log on at the same time. I just wished they had offered to connect me via cable on day 1.    I had a 2-hr ""Hamman Royale"" treatment at their spa which consisted of 1-hr of gommage with savon noir and application of body mud mask and facial mask followed by a 1-hr relaxation massage with hot stone and scented oil. It was good but unremarkable and paled in comparison again to top Asian spas.    I ate at both their Italian and French restaurants and the food was of very high quality. Service was good but not top-notch. Example: I had explained at the outset of the meal that I do not eat meat or meat products such as bouillon or consomme the head waiter seemed to understand perfectly and instantly my requirements. At the end of the meal when the mignardises arrived after the dessert consisting of 3 items I was suspicious that some may contained gelatin which is a meat-derivative and so I inquired about that and was told that one item did contain gelatin. Fortunately I asked but I would have thought that they would have given us items that were vegetarian to begin with. Finally after explaining that the one item had gelatin I was just told what not to eat. A world-class establishment would have apologized removed the plate and then returned with a plate consisting of entirely vegetarian items.    The check-in process took forever with the staff making iterative trips to the front desk to photocopy our passports etc. The friendly staff took us up to our room and launched into a rehearsed (but barely intelligible) standard speech about the hotel history and features in general without answering my questions. Once in the room he proceeded to explain the features focusing on obvious ones but ignoring the most important point: how to work the light switches! We are well-traveled and used to hotel gadgets but it took us more than an hour wondering how the lighting is so dark and limited before realizing the light switches (two different types) are actually dimmer and need to be held down to control the brightness. The dimmer controls are not intuitive as the light switches are retro-chic and non consistent. Even with full brightness the room can be dim at night.    The hotel has its own extensive gardens and potager lovely for a stroll. However both times we walked around the gardens we were greeted with an unpleasant smell as workers were applying fertilizers on the ground. Still it was impressive.    Their Churchill bar has nice ambiance and very expensive drinks. Breakfast buffet spread (by the pool) was extensive and of good quality. No issue having hot chocolate made with soy milk.    The location is convenient only a 10-min walk to the main square and bazaar for shopping.",Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"San Francisco, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sfvoyage
La Mamounia Marrakech,tanpc3 wrote a review Sep 2012,30,"Beautiful place and excellent staff, but doormen allows taxi to overcharge",Firstly allow me to say in all fairness that La Mamounia is a wonderful hotel with fantastic ambience and the piano bar was excellent place to chill and relax. The decor in hotel and the setup of the gardens were all immaculate.    However there is a big problem regarding to getting out of the hotel. The doormen initially appeared helpful in getting us a taxi having done so we were informed by both the taxi and the doormen that there is a flat rate of 100 dirhams ~ 10 Euros for taxis picking up passengers from the hotel regardless of the very short distance we were going. Just for reference taxi rates for such a distance is typically 1.5-2 Euros. The principle behind that is very disturbing. The fact that the doormen verified the taxi driver's story was disturbing if indeed the hotel's core values should be to look out for it's customers. I have never heard of taxi drivers charging differently just because one is staying at a good hotel not unless it is a special limo or taxi for non-regular purposes.    I hope the hotel can do something about it or at least advice the customers more appropriately  e.g if you take a short walk away from the entrance hotel the taxi's would have to take you at regular rates.,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Singapore, Singapore",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tanpc3

La Mamounia Marrakech,woodsyKent wrote a review Sep 2012,50,Divine,We stayed at La Mamounia for 4 nights in August and had a truly wonderful time. The grounds are stunning and overall the service was very good. Although it was a bit slow in the outdoor bar - which was surprising given the hotel was fairly quiet.    The hotel is situated in a great location - only a few mins walk to the medina but far enough away from the crowds that you can chill out and relax if you want to.    We stayed in a park suite overlooking the gardens. The room more than lived up to our expectations and was definitely worth the upgrade. We had 2 balconies a sitting area 2 loos a huge bedroom and bathroom. I've never seen such sunning decor - the pictures don't do it justice.    The SPA was pure luxury I had the most relaxing massage ever!    I would definitely recommend booking on a B&B basis. Breakfast was buffet style which offered an extensive range of delicious hot and cold food from pastries to eggs benedict and kept us full till dinner most days. The poolside service was excellent and the snacks were very tasty - especially the chicken salad which tasted wonderful due to the home grown herbs from the hotel's garden.    The pool was magnificent and a definite plus point if you are travelling in August as it's 47 degrees during the day.    In summary I would recommend this hotel if you’re looking for a luxurious break in beautiful surroundings with all of the finery that you would expect from a 5 star hotel.,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,kent,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/woodsyKent
La Mamounia Marrakech,lipi5star wrote a review Sep 2012,50,Mamounia forever. What else ?,We have stayed at the Mamounia several times before renovation. The Mamounia has been our savior each time we planned to stay elsewhere in Marrakech. Rented a ryad in the Medina once: catastrophe ended up at the Mamounia went to a boutique hotel in the Palmeraie: catastrophe: ended up at the Mamounia. Now I know that in Marrakech it’s Mamounia or nothing.    People complaining about the service or saying this hotel is not the top anymore? We are not talking about the same place. It’s true that the former employees remembered us and were so happy to see us back that they were more than kind even offered us the desert at the French restaurant as a welcome back. Everybody was wonderful absolutely everybody from the moment we were greeted with almond milk and dates till the moment they put our luggage into the car for departure. I can’t even list all the little attentions and details that pleased us. And for that amount of staff (750 people at your service) I believe that he price of the room is not that expensive.    I love Jacques Garcia’s decoration even if the general remark is the darkness => not very photogenic if you want to take pictures of yourself inside. Room was great I can’t even talk about the quality of the bed and the Porthault bed sheets!!! The best sleep I had in a hotel for a while. Acoustics are good if you are not unlucky enough to be neighbors with a hysterical American woman who spends her time yelling at her companion (fortunately they left…).    As for the food it is true that it’s a bit expensive. The breakfast buffet is beautiful and you regret you just can’t eat all they have to offer. Service was remarkable they tried to anticipate all our needs.  The French restaurant was delicious (entrée great main course good and desert out of this world) . The Italian was great for lunch: the deserts were so amazing we wanted to go back but for lunch they alternate the opening of the French and Italian restaurant. For diner both are open. So we had to go back to the Italien in the evening and this was my only disappointment. The menu was different and double priced for the same quality. I didn’t understand why we’d be paying more just because it’s the evening. They didn’t have the ingredients for the desert I wanted (figs) so I had to chose another one which ended up being disappointing. All in all for that diner I felt I just threw 150 EU through the window.  We also had Morrocan food served in our room and it was just as great as it was in my souvenir. Bar is great and I’m so happy they opened the little Menzeh pavilion for ice creams and pastries as the Mamounia cornes de gazelles are the best in the world. They were even nice enough to prepare some for us to take away when we left.    The pool is gorgeous huge. The gardens are among the most beautiful on earth. I do wish they were even more severe with ugly tourists wandering around. If you want to see the top just please dress the part.  The Mamounia hotel will always be in our hearts it’s paradise on earth and we are counting the days till we get back there.    PS: for dog owners not tried this time because our dog died but in the past our dog was always very well welcomed and he loved the park. It seems it's still the case because they even have a menu for dogs.,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,brussels,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lipi5star
La Mamounia Marrakech,the427 wrote a review Sep 2012,50,Amazing but very expensive,I am torn between how fantastic this place is and now utterly expensive everything is. Lets start off with the good.    The hotel is amazing. The inside is very swanky without being over the top the staff are polite and the outside gardens/pool area is beautiful. Our Riad recommend that we visit here just to see what it was like and we were blown away. I would recommend that you get the establishment you are staying in to call ahead and either book a table or tell them you are coming down as there is a strict policy about letting non guests in. I would also recommend that you dress smart to get past the bouncers on the door. While we were inside we saw some people in shorts and vests wandering around but they were staying there so it was deemed acceptable.    The downside is the price. My friend and I went to have a look around and a cocktail. The Mojito's we ordered were lovely but they were also nearly £25 each. We took our time drinking these realizing that we could dine in the market for less than £10 for the both of us. We had a look around the pool and gardens and the staff informed us that we could use the facilities for the whole day at a cost of £100 per person....eek!    This is a lovely place to go and I imagine the food to be outstanding as well as the rooms but I would recommend only spending a few hours in there.

We also ate in the terrace of our room with beautiful view of the gardens and surroundings. Each was exceptional.    The rooms are large with high ceilings and wonderful balconies overlooking either the pool and gardens or the mosque and old city. The rooms have modern fixtures but the decor is the wonderful Moorish/art deco blend used throughout the hotel. Every detail is more than art and stays preciously there.

Beyond a fantastic culture and wild restaurant and nightlife scene the trip was made over the top through our stay at Mamounia.    The building is stunning and the rooms incredibly well detailed.

His name is Mehdi and he so much love and passion for what he did and his magnificent city that is set the tone for our adventure.    We had been given recommendations of restaurants and things to do. He assessed our needs and what we were looking for and quickly adjusted us to the most amazing places we have been in recent memory.

La Mamounia Marrakech,jal3137 wrote a review Sep 2012,50,Gorgeous hotel,My sister and I stayed here for 5 nights. We had an amazing suite (room 308) that left nothing to be desired. It was truly spectacular with the gorgeous tileceilings balcony. Everything. The hotel pool and all of the restaurants are fantastic. The bulding and grounds are very pretty and there is even a spectacular fitness center to make up for the eating you will surely do. It made us less interested in leaving at night to be honest and I don't regret it. With two restaurants with Michelin stars you can't lose. Maeakkech is a sad place in comparison. You can buy a bottle of water for $.50 in the town but 10x that in the hotel. While it was an interesting city all of the US press (especially home decor lately)doesn't show that they don't even have signs up at the tourist spots to explain the extensive history. It is Mexico but decades ago perhaps. Sad to see the differences and certainly leaves you feeling disappointed that it appears they won't find a way soon to bring tourist dollars to the masses there that need it.    If you go the hotel is first rate. They hooked us up with a driver that would be ideal for just targeting places you want to go and if you can get to some of the shops that are out of the souks in that way there is incredible craftsmanship especially in leather goods. Check out the blogs with lists of great shops around the city particularly up by the Jardin Marjorelle and in the new town Guiliez. The driver took us out to a dinner place that was good/average but the ride there was worth it all. It was like a video game in the challenge of the driving along narrow streets with peoplebikesmopeds and horses to dodge. Amazing.

La Mamounia Marrakech,AAlisberg wrote a review Aug 2012,30,"Marrakech Icon, but indifferent service",La Mamounia is an exceptionally beautiful historic property. This is the Marrakech icon where Churchill stayed and Hitchcock filmed. The gardens rooms art and common rooms are remarkable and recall the splendor of Morroco. We found several short comings. The entire property is excessively dark. The hot water in our shower never heated up and the drain in the wash basin did not work. We had a hard time navigating the property and found the directions from the staff unhelpful. Our wait for a cocktail took so long we abandoned our plan and went straight into dinner. It took forever to get our bags both at checkin and check out. None of these shortcomings should be tolerated in a first rate and expensive hotel. All in all it is worth seeing but it would have been a better experience if they cared more about guest services.,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Greenwich, Connecticut",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AAlisberg
La Mamounia Marrakech,massimiliano wrote a review Aug 2012,10,Disappointing,I have been at la mamounia 3 times after the reopening of the hotel and every time is worst and worst.  Service is not attentive people are pretentious and snobbish my room was not well cleaned and missed towels in the bathroom.  I booked 2 connecting rooms (de luxe) with AE centurion service. All the rooms at la mamounia are connecting through balcony hence my request is all except difficult to acheive.  They gave me the smallest rooms ever had.  Call the front desk (as centurion i am subject to upgrade) but They tell me the rooms were deluxe and hotel is full with no chance to do better.  Call AE and They tell me that have some problems with them. Once back in the hotel i have been contacted by the manager that offers me a suite....but the other room is not connecting and as my mother needs assistance i had to refuse.  Once paid i notice that in the bill has been added the massages i took (complimentary for my status of centurion) cashier told me sorry already paid!

The reason I went here was to see the gardens. It was recommended! but the problem would be to be let in!  Turned up and yes was politely refused. my linen long shorts and linen long sleeve top was okay my partners was not i suggested swopping clothes!! she did laugh then gave up and let us in begrudgingly! OMG! the hotel.......wow started with 2 men to open 2 doors then again 4ft later!! hotel is impressive!! eventually got to the gardens. Had a dander and left. They were okay!! after all that.

La Mamounia Marrakech,KDT15 wrote a review Aug 2012,50,Oasis of pleasure & relaxation,We'd already booked to stay at a riad in the heart of the Medina when a friend told me about the Mamounia's Summer Bliss package. It's 1200 dirham per person (about €110) for which you get all day use of the hotel's gorgeous indoor & outdoor pools jacuzzi gardens 3 course lunch at the pool restaurant (excluding beverages) plus afternoon tea in a little palace deep in the garden.The weekend we were in Marrakech it was 47C so we were very glad to have booked the day at La Mamounia. From the moment we entered La Mamounia's front gardens we were in another world: first we were personally guided around the hotel and shown the facilities restaurants bars and our package was explained including lunch & tea times. The pool attendant settled us in sunloungers by the big outdoor pool and our summer bliss began: fabulous lunch (lunch at the pool restaurant alone rates as a Top 10 Marrakech experience) with outstanding service interspersed with a lazy day of swimming & sunning followed by showers in the spa a leisurely walk through the gardens to our choice of tea and sweets in the tea palace. We ended up drinking Mojito's in Churchill's Bar (not included in Summer Bliss) looking out at Majorelle's fabulous ceiling. It was the best day we had in Marrakech and so totally worth it If you can't stay at La Mamounia Summer Bliss is the next best thing...,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Marlow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KDT15
La Mamounia Marrakech,fussy-guests wrote a review Aug 2012,30,Little more than a bog-standard resort,Maybe in years gone-by la mamounia really was one of the best hotels in the world.  But to claim it is today suggests the management should get out more.    Whilst the multi million refit means rooms are very comfortable the garden beautiful the spa attractive and the lobby impressive the pool area would not look out of place in a bog-standard resort.    But where this hotel really shows it is not in the first division let alone one of the best is in the service. It's inflexible and ostentatious and sadly rather inefficient. I tried toget some breakfast two minutes after the buffet closed - and the answer was no. I had to fight for a coffee at a table in the breakfast area!    Winston Churchill may have raved about this place more than half a century ago but today there are far better places to stay in Marrakesh. Go and find them.

La Mamounia Marrakech,sfhappycamper wrote a review Jul 2012,50,An amazing oasis of peace in a super-frenetic city,Mamounia is one of the best hotels that we have ever stayed in. It is also the most expensive we have ever stayed in by a large margin. But an experience that we would repeat in a heart-beat.    When you arrive the gates open to a beautiful garden space with a driveway leading to a doorway that is manned by a group of men in beautiful uniforms some of which are very berber in style which is quite unique and an impressive start to the whole experience. You are immediately offered delicious dates and almond milk as you enter a cool richly detailed space with the sound of water in the background. After the hectic airport experience and busy city outside your blood pressure instantly falls.    The main access of the public spaces are grand and old-style and very richly detailed with beautiful art. We did not visit the spa but I assume it is gorgeous. There is a business center and a nice work-out facility with a small view of the garden. Wi-fi was free on our package but we still used the business center with 3 i-macs. The concierge service is excellent. They booked us a tour of the markets; a carriage tour of the new city; a berber lunch in the desert at La Pause which was a delicious and fun experience although given the heat we should have gone for dinner; dinners (we loved going to Comptoir Darna); and a vip pick-up service from the airport that zipped us through customs. We were initially scheduled to do the hammam but we ran out of time. There is an ATM near the shops by the small gardens in front of the hotel which is a nice feature and a more private way to extract money than in the main square.    We stayed in one of the 3 riad's which are heart-stoppingly gorgeous. They feature a beautiful entry-way a living room a dining room a kitchen a beautiful patio and large outdoor pool and lounging area an upstairs lounging area 3 bedrooms and baths with large closets and another living room next to the master bedroom. Everywhere you look there is incredible moroccan detailing. The riads are enormous and the perfect hide-away from the outside world. There is butler and housekeeping service that is friendly and helpful. I was skeptical that the riad experience could match its ridiculously expensive price tag but it exceeded our expectations. It was over-the-top amazing.    Outside of the riad were the very large and famous Mamounia gardens. They were a total oasis of peace in the french style of gardening with long allees. The gardens are filled with palm trees beautiful plants birds turtles fish a vegetable garden a hidden ice cream restaurant and water features. They were the perfect place to enjoy a shaded walk and enjoy the gorgeous light of Marrakech. When we visited it was incredibly hot (115 degrees) and it was nice to just lounge at the riad by the pool. Outside in the city of Marrakech all was frenetic hot and full of people trying to sell you anything and everything. The city has incredible energy but especially in the heat it becomes a bit over-whelming. We would go out in the evening to enjoy the square. We stayed at another excellent hotel in Marrakech as well (the Royal Mansour) and what really set Mamounia apart were the gorgeous and serene gardens.    The hotel itself is worth seeing just for the artwork and grand old style. The rich moroccan detailing everywhere you look gives the hotel a very unique sense of place. This is not a cookie-cutter hotel. The restaurants are all exceptionally good and exceptionally beautifully decorated. The serving plates and table setting are gorgeous. The service is warm and excellent. We ate at all 3 of the main restaurants and the french one was our favorite closely followed by the italian. The moroccan restaurant was really good but for the price you might prefer to eat at another excellent but cheaper moroccan restaurant in marrakech. That being said it was a wonderful dinner and we are happy to have experienced it. All 3 restaurants feature incredible wine lists and excellent service. We did not eat by the pool since it was so hot but it is a gorgeous pool with a beautiful restaurant. The italian bar is airy stylish and gorgeous and we preferred it to the Churchill bar which was a bit over-the-top in clubby red leather and leopard-print with low ceilings that felt a tiny bit claustrophobic. Both are decadently fun.    While Mamounia is expensive so are all of the other luxury hotels in its category. Having stayed at another five star hotel inside the city wall (Royal Mansour) and talked to close friends who stayed at luxury hotels outside the city wall (Four Seasons and Aman) we feel that Mamounia was the best of all of them with the location and gardens being key selling points since I assume that the service and style of all of the others was also wonderful.    This hotel has a great location just inside the city walls. We would walk to the square in just a few minutes. It felt totally safe other than crossing the busy streets thronged with horse carriages bicyclists motorcyclists people taxis and cars.    This hotel is a world-class place to splurge for a very special occasion. We can't wait to go back. We loved every minute of it!,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,sf,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sfhappycamper

La Mamounia Marrakech,Stuart G wrote a review Jul 2012,50,An Oasis in the desert,On a recent trip to Marrakech found ourselves some 27 kilometres away from the city and somewhat isolated. The hotel I was staying at runs a twice daily shuttle to the centre but this gives one only a couple of hours in which to explore and enjoy the sights let alone eat and drink. Before travelling an Italian Restuarant in a central Marrakech hotel was recommended to us as a 'must do' and being a big fan of Italian cuisine did not take much persuading.  Given our location outside of the city we decided to stay in one of the larger city centre hotels for a night so that we could visit the restaurant located in Hotel La Mamounia. Further enquires through American Express revealed that the Mamounia was a partner hotel and they were able to offer a deal pretty much at similar cost to the nearby Sofitel so we decided to dine and also to stay overnight at La Mamounia.  I was not quite prepared for the 'Mamounia' experience which came as a very pleasant and almost overwhelming surprise. La Mamounia (one of the leading hotels of the world) turned out to be probably one of the most beautiful hotels I had ever set foot in. Tucked away just outside the Medina; it is like a private Oasis of peace and tranquility with an opulence and understated exotic luxury quite unlike any similarly rated hotel in Europe. The service provided by it's staff was equally so efficient thoughtful and so unobtrusive despite the beautifully flamboyant uniforms - that one almost didn't realise they were there anticipating every potential requirement of their guests. The room was very well appointed almost like a suite in itself with a separate lavatory and bidet set apart from a luxurious bathroom complete with a deep marbel bath and a walk-in wet room. Adjacent to a walk in wardrobe area - a very grand bedroom beckoned decorated with exquisite detail. The hotel had undergone a refurbishment some four years earlier and still glistened as if the redecoration had happened yesterday.  The facilities were amazing with three major restuarants (Italian French and Moroccan) each recognised on their own merits and each with their own distinct appeal and identity. Equally there were three bars including a Churchill's English Bar noted for its vast selection of malt whiskey. The hotel's grounds are extensive and well maintained - it is here one discovers the various strucutres that contain the gymnasium spa and breakfast/lunch pavillion by the large outdoor swimming pool. Additionally there is an indoor pool tennis courts and a large bar/terrace. From the grounds one can see the Atlas Mountains and both see and hear the nearby Koutoubia mosque. With a late check out arranged by AMEX we squeezed every last minute from the experience vowing to return as soon as we were able to explore Marrakech more fully using La Mamounia as our home for the stay.,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StuartG963

The craftsmanship and design of the hotel are stunning - amazing detail every where - inside and out. We wanted to touch everything - and the scents of dates and the candles wafting throughout the hotel were very nice. Make sure and take time to walk the grounds and enjoy the gardens in the front and rear of the property - especially the veg garden at the rear. The service was excellent and responsive and food was very good - although not excellent. The afternoon brunch/lunch by the pool is a great scene and very magnificent but not a good value for the $100 US price - per person. Try the cafe at the italian bar instead...The room service menu for intimate dining on your balcony overlooking the gardens is a great option too. Highly recommend and would definitely return.

The breakfast was so delicious an there's everything you could imagine. The service is perfect. I had a Royal Hamman in the spa. Latifa made the hammam on me and I liked very much. At first I was a little bit scared by the moroccan ritual but at the end I loved and my skin was very soft and hydrated. Leila made my massage and was fantastic. My husband had the massage by Asma and liked very much too. We had dinner in the room in the french and in the italian restaurant. The room's dinner was fantastic with the view of the Minarete.

From the moment we walked in we felt completely welcomed transported to another world and shown the true hospitality of Morocco. The property is stunning. We stayed in one of the Executive Suites on the top floor with a completely serene view of the incredible gardens and some of the Madina. The hand crafted detail of all of the fixtures and finished in the room were exquisite. From the wood doors to the shutters to the hand painted ceilings to the free standing tub and amazing tile work it did not disappoint. Every employee on the property was there to assist and make sure you had everything you needed. Every little detail was covered. We had room service multiple times throughout the stay with coffee and croissants for breakfast (under $20) and then a dinner or two on our private patio overlooking the garden. All of the meals were outstanding delivered quickly and memorable. We also ate in the Moroccan restaurant on the property and sat on the back patio of the old Rhiad. And the buffet lunch by the pool was outstanding (but very expensive for a lunch!). We also enjoyed massages in the beautiful spa. We were worried about staying at a larger property instead of at one of the many Rhiads with the potential of missing a true Moroccan feel. We had no regrets. La Mamounia has just raised the bar.

La Mamounia Marrakech,CotswoldsFiona wrote a review May 2012,40,Day pass for the pools so worth it,We couldn't afford to stay at the Mamounia as guests but spent a day using the pools for £38. This means you can walk around the beautiful historical gardens too. The main pool is vast and a perfect temperature for both lounging in the shallows and proper swimming. Utter heaven.    Things to watch  - The food and drink are extremely expensive (if you are the sort of person who can't afford to stay as guests) so budget at least as much for refreshments as the day pass.  - There is no separate no smoking area and nearly all the french guests around the pools smoked at some point so if you have health reasons for needing to avoid passive smoking like me there is a bit of jumping up from the sunbed into the pool/garden to get away from cigarette smoke.  - Dress smartly to get through security on the front gate (ie no shorts and shirts better than tshirts) and tell them you have a reservation  - Reserve or at least check with the hotel before arriving for the day as sometimes it is closed to non-residents when VIPs visit etc  - There are different day packages available some with spa treatments and lunch included - check the website  - Be prepared for the rather unsavoury sight of 70 year old men with 20 year old female companions...,Date of stay: May 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Gloucestershire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CotswoldsFiona

La Mamounia Marrakech,aneta d wrote a review May 2012,50,Most Beautiful Place On Earth,"We recently returned from a trip to Morocco which included two days at the La Mamounia. From the moment we crossed onto the property to the moment we left we were inundated and overwhelmed by a sensuous and beautiful experience I could not imagine.  The gardens of the La Mamounia are beyond compare. The scent of orange blossoms hangs heavily in the air. The roses are bursting with flowers. Perfectly landscaped landscapes at every turn of all types. I was amazed by the artichoke plants which were nearly 6 feet tall!  I have read negative reviews by those who were turned away from walking the grounds as they were not guests. GOOD. La Mamounia -- we guests THANK YOU. If every curious passer by were allowed to roam the grounds they would be inundated with visitors not affording guests of the hotel peace and enjoyment. If you want to see a pretty garden open to the public there's one across the street or you can go up to the Jardin Majorelle. The La Mamounia is a HOTEL not a city park.  The interior of the hotel was recently remodeled to divine perfection ever aspect having been considered. The hotel even has a signature ""scent"".  Customer service and attention are spot on. We were greeted at the gate our bags taken from us and seated in the lobby area. We were checked in while enjoying almond milk after being given hot clothes to wash our hands. After the painless check in we were given a tour of the hotel shown the various amenities with the history explained in brief. Our room (beautiful) was presented to us with the features explained.  We had one meal on the terrace and one dinner at the french restaurant. The terrace meal (sandwich because we were starving) was acceptable. The meal at the french restaurant was really very good and the attention to detail and wait staff were great. It's really what fancy continental restaurants in the US strive but pathetically fail to be -- gracious ever-present but not hovering staff. No attitude at all.  In short --- there is a reason why the La Mamounia is representative of a particular class of hotel. You can get a lovely room at a nice riad in many places in Marrakech but the La Mamounia is an experience on all levels. It did not disappoint in the slightest.",Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Los Angeles, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anetad730

Breakfast is by the pool with first class service and wonderful dishes from Morrocco and international cuisine.An open windowed kitchen cooked egg fiorentine etc etc!!  The renovation at this old very well known hotel was done with money no object.It was a little flashy but in a kind of classy way lol.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Nina J wrote a review Apr 2012,50,Sublime Experience in a Tropical Setting,Rarely does one come across such a high level of customer service delivery. Coming from the hotel industry it is generally so easy to pick flaws in a hotel operation not so at La Mamounia. The welcome was warm and genuine the decor authentic with a contemporay twist. The facilities in the room left nothing to be desired and the outlook over the gardens was tropical with wonderful bird life. Excellent variety of food and beverage including Moroccan Italian and French restaurants and the buffet restaurant by the pool for breakfast and lunch is a must with an extraordinarily wide variety of choices. Try the Moroccan wines with an interesting selection of grapes types particularly the Rosés. An eclectic mix of clientele all with the same high expectations of luxury service and relaxed guest experience and none that we could tell were disappointed.

Impressive entrance and lobbies but a reather dark and sombre place. Old fashioned original room which was small and complicated in terms of electrics and bathroom. Good but not great which we were expecting. Lovely pool and superb buffet beakfast overlooking it. Formal Freanch and Italian restaurants were excellent but highy priced. Casual eating very limited and outdoor sitting and bar space very poor and limited indeed.Staff and service were good but not top class and no comparisson with our five star asian experiences.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Juliet H wrote a review Apr 2012,50,Wonderful Oasis,This is truly an oasis in the middle of a hectic city. The high walls make you forget you are anywhere near the hustle and bustle right next door. Everything from initially walking through the front door exceeds expectations. Even if the hotel is out of your budget (it was for us) I highly recommend walking around the grounds and enjoying cocktails on the terrace (cocktails are extremely expensive even by large US city standards but well worth it to enjoy a bit of the afternoon or evening at this wonderful location). Staff is incredibly welcoming and friendly.,Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Juliet008

La Mamounia Marrakech,rubyyao wrote a review Apr 2012,50,La grande dame,I stayed at la mamounia 10 years ago and hated it. I decided to come back and stay a night after the renovation to see how much better it can get. I was very sceptical at first but wow!!! The rooms were immaculate and the public areas are just stunning. Yes it does lack the intimacy of a nice riad but the grandeur certainly makes it unique. One complaint the rhe rooms facing the street are extremely noisy. I moved to one facing the garden but still heard a lot of noise at 8 in the morning due to some maintenance work being done I gather. Not quite considerate of them I thought. I ate at the Italian restaurant and the room itself is marvelous. The bed by the way is very comfortable although I wish they have slightly softer pillows. All in all a very pleasant stay.,Date of stay: April 2012,,"Hong Kong, China",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rubyyao
La Mamounia Marrakech,Mabel_Gripper wrote a review Apr 2012,30,"Great place, terrible management",Went there with 4 other guests and took 3 rooms 2 of which were suites. Place is lovely very centrally located and the food at the pool and at the Italian is amazing. Food at French restaurant is 'emotional' and if you ask for mains with no starters they still make you wait an hour and a half. And then get stroppy about it. Moroccan was average at best. Worst thing was concierge 'service'. Aside from our bill being wrong and them getting stroppy when we quite rightly queried mis-applied monies to our bill my 80-year old mother also had the misfortune to leave her wallet in her room safe by mistake. We told them same-day and despite finding it it took them 5 days before they would send it. Why? Because despite spending over £12k on our stay they didn't trust we'd pay the £70 quid they wanted to DHL it back to the UK. Then after a long wait they tell us that DHL won't carry cash so they have taken all my mother's money out of her wallet (about £80) and are keeping it in their safe. They do not offer to return it to us. I call to speak to the manager 3 times and after the 4th he reluctantly calls back. Does it not occur to them they should have had the decency to a) tell us they couldn't DHL money and b) apply that money to the cost of DHL ost? No. It takes 3 calls from me to the GM Mr Picquot before they accept that they ought to pay the money back to my mother. Oh and Mr Picquot is 'Sorry I do not think they handled it well'. My feeling? Mr Picquot should rest a little lighter on his laurels because people don't usually like being treated like fools. Might be one of the best hotels in the world but at this juncture I am struggling to see why and they have left a VERY bitter taste in our mouths .

La Mamounia Marrakech,foodiesubie wrote a review Apr 2012,40,Step back in time - an experience (but don't eat there),I definitely recommend stopping by to see the Mamounia. It is a singular experience the gardens are lush and expansive the property just feels like it is from the 20s and has been preserved in its beauty.    The food did not look amazing nor worth the exorbitant price so we just popped in for pre-dinner drinks. The service is wonderful attentive perfectly executed. But I should mentioned we forked over 25 euro per drink for the pleasure of enjoying the surroundings (though the spiced almonds were excellent).

La Mamounia Marrakech,wonderingtrio wrote a review Apr 2012,50,"Old world charm, delicious food, and excellent service","My husband seven year-old daughter and I had an excellent stay at the La Mamounia We stayed in a lovely riad for 2 nights but wanted to experience La Mamounia as well. The luxury riads in both Fes and Marrakesh are definitely worth experiencing but one does get the impression at times that they are clinging to life. The La Mamounia is however unabashadly attempting to provide luxury. We thought the service was excellent and the staff was accomadating at every level. It is quite expensive but as always you pay for what you get. Marrakesh is a feast for the senses but after a day out and about sightseeing it was nice to be catered to.  Our room was one of the ""cheaper"" options but was more than adequate with a lovely view over the city. The hotel picked us up from our riad in lovely jaguar which made the transition very easy. They also allowed us to check in and check out early without any extra charges -- unusual these days. We had lunch on the terrace one day and walked around the gardens. We were hesitant about eating Italian in Morocco but this turned out to be one of the nicest meals we've had in a while -- and a refreshing break from the delicious but ubiquitous tagines. The service was attentive and excellent the food was well thought out and delicious. My seven year-old daughter said this meal was ""just yummy."" The next day we had a sumptuous Sunday Brunch at the poolside restaurant. Our very nice waiter even brought a bag of goodies for later for my daughter because she was eager to get in the pool rather than eat -- completely unsolicited. There was also an excellent jazz band playing at the Italian bar in the evening. A night-time walk around the gardens is essential -- the lighting is spectacular.  After 10 days travelling around Morocco our stay at the La Mamounia was the perfect and rejuvenating epitaph for our trip. We would love to stay there again someday.",Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Des Moines, IA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wonderingtrio

We were warmly welcomed and directed to the American bar a large space which was unfortunately nearly empty aapart from the staff. The mood was not helped by the fact that the pianist and jazz singer were in the midst of an argument. In spite of this the music was enjoyable and the cocktails though very expensive were skilfully made and accompanied by interesting nibbles.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Coltbridge wrote a review Apr 2012,20,Trading on its history - three times overpriced,We went here for dinner.  Not a good start when the gatekeeper gave us a hostile look-over (we were dressed in European smart casual) before reluctantly allowing us to step over the threshold. A gin and tonic in the bar - elaborately and slowly prepared before us on a tray at £15 a throw.    Then dinner in the Morroccan restaurant. The restaurant was nearly empty but they still invited us to sit in the same booth as a random stranger. We moved (causing some stir) to one of our own.    The menu was moderately interesting. We had three starters as we werent ravenous. Nothing amazing about the food but three starters and a modest bottle of wine set us back £200.    We then had a drink in the churchill bar. Another wildly overpriced experience. We didnt see any rooms but from the outside they looked like any plain resort hotel rooms - blocky small balconies not especially quiet or special. I felt rather sorry for anyone who actually paid £600 a night to stay here.

La Mamounia Marrakech,ChloeDCN wrote a review Mar 2012,30,Poolside buffet alone would get a 5 rating but not sure about the rest.,I stayed here first back in March 2011. Located not so far from the medina we were struck by the sheer beauty of the place we were welcomed in with doors open for us by men and women in the most beautiful Moroccan dress. There was a dress code to eat here which we abided to we did not stay at the hotel however so I cannot comment on the rooms but we ate here twice once we had cocktails in the lounge afterwards and we used a day pass once (the same day we ate the poolside buffet). We wanted to experience La Mamounia as all our guide books raved on about this grand hotel. I will now break down my experience.    Poolside Buffet - Cannot fault it one ounce. Yes it is approx 50GBP per head and that is without drinks I think we paid an eyewatering 7GBP for a bottle of sparkling water. The meal was worth every penny no doubt. There was everything on offer including various types of salads cheeses stews anti pasti style meats various rolls etc. There was also a carving station with roast meats and a grilling station where you can have steak or fish alongside live oysters. The mini taster deserts were to die for there were also sorbet and fresh fruit. Everything was hygienic and the staff treated us with upmost respect and catered for our every whim. Such a wonderful buffet and I recommend anyone staying in Marrakech to try it. My only bug bear was that it finished at 3pm as I think that the buffet would make an ideal dinner meal too.    Moroccan restaurant - On site there are three restaurants Moroccan French and Italian. We tried the Moroccan one evening. The beautiful ambiance and the fact the waiting staff were brilliant we were even serenaded by Moroccan musicians in our own private booth seemed like smoke and mirrors to hide less than satisfactory food. I ordered a Tagine it was quite cold nothing like the steamy hot tagines served in the square. It also tasted quite bland I wasn't happy with it at all and had to send it back by the time a new one appeared my partner and young son had already long finished their main courses and I didn't wish to eat alone so we cancelled the Tagine all together. The brash manageress still wanted the tagine to be paid for and was insistent to the point of being down right rude! Needless we stuck to our guns and did not pay for something we didn't get.    Pool area buildings and gardens - A must if you are visiting Marrakech the gardens are well maintained and filled with orange trees. There's a small building further into the garden which sells macaroons and sweets. The pool is clean calming and very quiet with poolside staff. The pool is also heated which is a plus when visiting Morocco in the colder months. This is a very grand posh place and the indoor pool and spa area looked absolute luxury.    Now the reason this place got a 3 out of 5 was for the rude manageress and the cold tagine in the Moroccan restaurant on our initial visit. And also on our later visit in August the very abrupt woman at the door first refused us entry because my partner was wearing loafers and shorts - they were not sports shorts they were dress shorts Chinos infact and it was over 40 degrees! He was dressed almost identical to our visit back in March. She soon let us in when we said we wanted to book a room! (which we had no intentions of doing). There was just a difference in attitude to the staff almost as if we were imposing on them just for wanting to walk round the gardens and eat at the buffet again (which was sadly closed in August for Ramadam).,Date of stay: August 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChloeDCN

La Mamounia Marrakech,Source1 wrote a review Mar 2012,50,Wow!!!,"Wow. We just returned from Morocco and France. In Marrakech we stayed at La Mamounia easily one of the best hotels if not the best (it would take some thinking) we have ever stayed at and we travel extensively. Everything is perfect at this hotel and for the price it's well worth it and more. The location the staff the food and drink the pool the gardens...you name it and it couldn't be better. Their only goal at LaMamounia no matter who it is is to please the guest in every way possible. They are absolutely unconditional in this regards. We prevailed upon the Concierge with a number of requests including a change to our flight plans and future hotels and they handled everything with the upmost of professionalism and efficiency. Did I mention the Italian restaurant in the hotel? You may think ""an Italian restaurant in Morocco how good can it be?"". The best! The French and Moroccan restaurants in the hotel are also excellent. If you like your cocktails the Churchill bar is what hotel bars are all about...dark cozy excellent service craft cocktails and a live piano player and singer who were excellent. The pool area is superb and again their service there is perfect. Lastly their spa recognized as one of the best in the world lives up to that distinction. We absoluted hated it when we had to leave.

Even the gravel of the pathways in the garden i being raked and flattened out several times a day!! Amazing restaurants as expected from a restaurant of such standard a great classy bar/lounge the breakfast area by the pool... i better stop here because i will never manage to exhaust all its perks.

We said we would wait in the lobby until it came online and suddenly a solution offered. We were escorted to the spa to pay the day rate and then rudely shown a tiny change room. No showers or bathrobes. No one asked us at the poolside if we wanted a drink. The pool and spa staff we met were cold and scowling unless a tip in front of them.

La Mamounia Marrakech,patentattorney wrote a review Feb 2012,50,The best hotel I have ever stayed in,"From the moment we arrived at the hotel and four porters opened the double doors we knew this place was going to be fabulous. Our guest relations representative Salah was a delight we had booked a gourmet package over three days and had to arrange an itinerary to fit it all in. Our package included two evening meals one in the moroccan restaurant the other in the Italian. A Moroccan tea ritual where we were taught how to make mint tea with green tea. A hammam and a massage. A guided tour of Marrakech with a guide who has shown prime ministers and presidents around ( and apparently Brad Pitt). But the best bit was a two hour cookery lesson with the Michelin starred French chef and then we ate lunch at the restaurant and ate the food he showed us how to cook.  The hotel itself was beautiful. The gardens are fabulous and very relaxing and quiet considering the hotel is so near all the hustle and bustle. The level of service is fantastic. Our room was sumptuous and felt very authentic with tiled Walls. The music in the Italian bar and the Churchill bar was great. The ambience in the hotel at all times was just right. The spa and indoor pool is absolutely fabulous. The outside pool is vast. We were never ""spa people"" but as this package came with the hammam and massage we went with the flow. I can honestly say that both myself and my husband are now converts.  This hotel is a true world class five star hotel. It's like the Dorchester but with better service.  This is an expensive hotel but I've stayed in hotels which are similar in cost and not had as good an experience as here. So if you're looking for a hotel in an interesting location with fabulous food excellent service and great facilities. This is the place.

There is no doubt that this is a spectacular hotel...the restaurants are top of the line...the pool area fantastic and the buffet they set up beside it at lunch just blows of away...spectacular also the garden and the fitness area (I was told). The room was nice and cosy with just the right amount of oriental atmosphere...when we entered there was an arangement of fresh fruit and i picked a pear. It was the best pear I have ever had in my life...it was like tasting a totally new fruit. I also visited Sir Winston Churchill's room who usually spent some days here in the winter months..the rooms still smells of his cigar...which I found was a well done little gimmick. So back to the initial question. If you can afford it by all means....but if you are somewhat tight and in need of your back-up credit card....don't cause it is no fun if you have to sit by the pool drinking water from the bottle you brought along while next to you they are having GinTonics olives and salted peanuts.

La Mamounia Marrakech,GlobalVenturer wrote a review Jan 2012,40,"Stay here if price is not an object... if it is, warn your bank manager!",We were here for 4 nights on a winter weekend break away from London. While the nights can be cool it was never cold and the warm sunny days only 3 hours flight away from London make this place the perfect getaway even if you are not interested in all the sights and charms of Marrakech itself. The hotel is 10 minutes walk from the center of the Jma el Fina square - a world heritage site.The hotel is a destination unto itself and is as exquisite as the hype suggests. It oozes luxury from the moment you pass through the well-guarded gates into the cosseted grounds of the walled estate and Moorish-styled with a splash of art-deco hotel beyond. The service is impeccable. Hotel employees are obviously handpicked for their good looks as much as their ability to converse fluently in English Arabic and French. The hotel is set in beautiful private gardens and the 40 foot walls of the ancient medina that border the hotel effectively keep the paparazzi general busy-bodies and sightseers and tourist rif raf out while ensuring exclusivity and privacy within. The Moroccan restaurant in its own building on the hotel’s estate is beautiful with great fresh local food and service to match. The gym also in its own separate building next to several tennis courts is huge and better equipped than most gyms you would probably belong to back home. The hotel’s spa is by far the most beautiful and luxurious I have ever seen and that’s saying something! It’s worth staying here just for the spa! The pool is huge and you will always find a sun bed amongst the verdant tropical greenery tucked away from the tall slim chain smoking bikini-clad French ladies-who-lunch who each look like they have stepped out of French Vogue with matching perfectly styled children and husband in tow. The rooms are large dark comfortable and well accessorised in the luxury amenities you would expect in a hotel of this standard. Sleeping in may not be possible though as the Imams call to prayer at sunrise can be heard as loud as if the guy was standing next to you in your room. Nevertheless staying here truly makes you feel like you are a special guest of the royal family in a Moroccan palace. However all of this comes at a price that makes one feel somewhat uneasy about committing to a return visit in a time of belt tightening and recession. Needless to say it is eye-wateringly expensive. How those beautiful French guests can afford it especially after an economic downgrade in their homeland is beyond me! Breakfast at Euro 100 per person and lunch at around Euro 130 per person excluding tip is frankly a shock if not expecting it - considering the monthly wage of the average hotel worker (which I suspect is several multiples of workers outside the hotel gate). Bar cocktails start at Euro 18 each. As part of a party of 10 people in 5 rooms celebrating a birthday on this trip we asked the hotel to book a minibus to take us to a pre-arranged dinner at a restaurant in town. The price was Pounds Sterling 50 each way for a 5-minute ride or a distance we could have walked in 15 minutes! To top it all off our final night's experience in the hotel’s fine dining French restaurant was not a happy one. We attempted to make reservations for 8.30 pm but were told we had to come at 7pm as the restaurant was fully booked – In fact the restaurant was mostly empty until after 9 pm and even then it was hardly full. Then the female French restaurant manager said that they could not accommodate all of us at a single table and we would be split into 2 tables of six. When we said we would go elsewhere all of a sudden it became possible for us to all sit together. Not quite the service expected or appreciated at the prices we were paying. However this was the only sour note of an otherwise wholly enjoyable and pampered few days. My advice – avoid the French restaurant here… the food isn’t worth the prices anyway. To sum up I share the sentiment of many of the earlier reviewers of this hotel. It is a big luxury to stay here and the prices ensure that it will remain the exclusive domain of the privileged few. Only come here if money is not an object as the beautiful hotel and the luxurious pampering and service is a wonderful treat. Don’t complain about the hotel’s apparent “nickel and dime-ing” and outrageous and apparent unjustifiable prices if that matters to you - you have been warned! This is definitely an experience of a lifetime for most of us in an exclusive domain of the rich and famous.,Date of stay: November 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobalVenturer

La Mamounia Marrakech,barfly_11 wrote a review Jan 2012,30,"No matter how rich you are, lunch is too expensive",After a week in Marrakesh eating in some lovely restaurants i was advised to try this hotel for amazing cocktails and food. I took my better half and tried the hotel which i must say is beautiful. I was taken to the pool restaurant where i paid in excess of £150.00 for a buffet meal that would not have been out of place in a four star all inclusive resort in the carribean. The meat was luke warm and peices small the wine at approx £15 per glass was nothing but local wine availiable at most hotels at less than a third of the price a bottle of still water will set you back a fiver and a champagne cocktail £30 ish (thats a 125 measure by the way). Even if i were a billionaire which I am not I would still be outraged at the cost of this less than average meal which consited of light salad two peices of meat and a glass of wine each. If you must go here make sure you are very hungry and eat as much as you can.....even then i'm not sure it will be value for money!,Date of stay: January 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Poulton Le Fylde,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barfly_11
La Mamounia Marrakech,markwlugano wrote a review Jan 2012,20,Not so Grand......,The room is sexywith lots of wood rich coloursarches and soft lighting.This is a place for a sordid love affair.As you walk in there is a guest toiletThis is followed by a small changing room which for some reason is placed next to the living room.The changing room is small and is more like a big wardrobe.The Living room is rich in colourful of burgundies and golds.Once again the Morrocan theme continuestiled flooringsornate wooden doors and copper lanterns..The bedroom has the same colour scheme and the archway leading to the living room has ornate plasterwork . There is a nice balcony from the living room and bedroom overlooking the exquisite gardens of the Mamounia The bathroom is a little small and the shower is minute.For me though it does feel very strange that there is a large distancebetween the bathroom and the changing area.  What I really love in the room are the MenusStationary holder and guide to the facilities of the hotel.All are bound in a beautiful orange leather and look as if they have come straight from Hermes.  The one thing I dislike in the room is the dust.I think no one has slept here for a long timethe shampoos and gels are covered in dustand if you run your finger down the surfacesthey become blackened.  The furnishings are nicenot opulentI prefer the furnishing s of my ittle Riad on the first night.For a room of the price I paidI feel there should be moremore more.  When entering the roomI get my biggest food welcome yeta mountain of fresh fruits and cakes awaits.There is also a lovely bottle of champagne on ice…DamnI wasn’t going to drink tonight.  I decide that after all of the gluttony I need to visit the gymnasium.On arrival I am told that it will close in 25 minutes.A little is better than nothing so I give a concerted effort and now I can have that glass of champagne.  I arrive later on in the Italian restaurantthere is a piano in the background the atmosphere is very romanticit’s a shame I am here alone. I hand the champagne to the waiterthe manager tells me they will charge me 30 Euros to open the bottle.I get into rather a heated discussion of how I cannot believe I have to pay to open a gift from the hotelpay more than the gift is worth(cheap champagne !).They relentbut the damage is doneto my humour and their reputation.Thisis a lesson in how to turn generosity into mean spirit.The meal at least takes the nasty taste from my mouth.I go to bed not feeling particularly glamourousmaybe tomorrow will give me a better Mamounia experience.  I wake up late and pack my clothes and then head off to breakfast.The buffet breakfast is served by the pool.It has a choice of many local and international dishesthe quality is goodthe presentation though is poorit reminds me of a 4 star hotel.  I then ask for a tour of the hotel.I meet Mohammedhe is very friendly and informative as he takes me around the spectacular hotel grounds.The public spaces and facilities are excellent.The base of the swimming pool is made of Murano crystal and is shimmering in the sun. At the back of the 8 hectare gardens is a small organic garden but I guess it is mainly for show as it is too small to serve the hotels kitchens.  The land was originally a garden and was given as a present by the sultan to his son El Mamoun.  The Hotel was built in 1923 and has been refurbished several times the last time was 3 years agoabout the same time my room was last cleaned I guess. There are so I am told an amazing 10750 square metres of the same type of painted ceilings in the hotel as in the Royal Mansour.Mohammed tells me that La Mamounia has commissioned a special scent made of cedarwood and spices I am sorry to say all I can smell is cigars.90% of Morocco it seems smoke and this hotel has no non smoking areas.The hotel has 3 private riads with 3 bedrooms each costs a mere 8000 Euro a night.I ask to see them but I am told that they are empty but housekeeping has not cleaned them yetthat I can believe.I do however visit the Koutoubia suitea very cheap 2000 euros a night!It is spacious and pretty but is on the street front and the windows are poor and you can hear a lot of street noise.It seems this is the case with all of the deluxe roomsbuyer beware.  I decide to try out the spa before I leaveyou know it’s a tough job this! The spa receptionist is not very courteous but the spa itself is sumptuous and I receive the finest massage I have had for a long time.  I check out of La Mamounia and I ask myselfwould I return?

La Mamounia Marrakech,ExperienceGalNYC wrote a review Jan 2012,40,Magical Marrakech,"Really tough to pick a place to stay at in Marrakech. First time in Africa and we were a bit out of element not knowing what to expect. Our decision proved to be a very good one because our experience was truly wonderful. We went in Dec 2011 (first week) for 10 days...La Mamounia was our home base we wanted to truly immerse ourselves in the culture instead of hopping around between towns. The hotel itself is just exceptional. It is part of the Leading Hotels of the World for a reason. The service was as expected for a top hotel: attentive consistent white glove treatment in most cases. Dec 2011 is a bit quieter so at times we felt we had the entire facility to ourselves which was quite nice. No need to worry about securing a great table at dinner great seat by the pool or great seat at the jazz club...it was great. Toward the end of our time there the Film Festival was taking place so it got a bit more crowded but the service level remained the same: high quality. The room itself was just great...sunny great balcony facing the city which we enjoyed. During the day and at night the call to prayer could be heard throughout the city and I always enjoyed it much when we were in our balcony around 7pm as we were getting ready for dinner...really magical. The premises themselves are spectacular: awesome orange and olive trees all over...incredibly pretty! The garden was really soothing to walk through during the day and night - we made it our daily ritual. The pool was one of my favorites never crowded and just huge and clean. The poolside table was also very strong: great staff accommodating and again consistent. The restaurants were really good particularly the Moroccan and Italian restaurants (the French restaurant experience could have been enhanced if other people were there we were literally the only ones - we went off season- but nonetheless it felt a bit odd). We ate at the Moroccan restaurant the first night and it was an amazing start to our culinary experience . One evening we wanted to arrange a night of ""chicha"" smoking as you would find in a hookah bar (that was not offered by the hotel) and the Head Concierge (who by the way was EXCEPTIONAL) arranged for us to attend a nearby 5 star hotel (through one of his 5 star connections) for this evening experience. He went above and beyond in all of our requests no matter how big or small. Lastly I will say that at the end of the trip the car service provided to the airport was a generous upgrade at no cost to us. That was really awesome - a great treat and we will always be very thankful!! The only thing preventing us from doing the max of 5 stars was the underwhelming experience at the spa (I won't go into details but frankly it was not up to par - as an award winning spa the bar must be higher...it wasn't great and I would not recommend a treatment); and I would say that we lamented the fact that we felt a bit secluded and removed from ""real"" Marrakech when on premises at the hotel. It's so opulent and perhaps even too modern for such a historical country. We wondered how the experience would be at a smaller mom/pop riad. Not sure we would necessarily choose a smaller riad because we enjoyed all of the amenities offered to us and truth be told at the end of the day in this hectic yet wonderful city it was GREAT to go to La Mamounia to replenish and get mentally/physically recharge for another day in town (let me tell you the outdoor market is intense and can be stressful!). Should we ever go back to Marrakech we wold undoubtedly stay in La Mamounia and would highly recommend it if you want an urban oasis in the thick of it all...",Date of stay: December 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ExperienceGalNYC

They insisted on taking my suitcase to deliver to my room which I was slightly reluctant to let them do. That is because it usually arrives about thirty minutes late and i would prefer to get settled as soon as possible. But you have to 'go with the flow'!    The rooms are good and the bathroom is superb. But I was left with the feeling that the architect who designed the bathroom had never actually stayed there because it was one of those hotels where everything was in the 'wrong' place for all practical purposes.

Granted it's expensive but it's La Mamounia afterall. Do not miss going to the pool and jacuzzi they are just as stunning as the rest of the hotel. Rooms are excellent and so is the bedding breakfast/brunch diverse and rich with lots of fresh fruits and juices alongside the traditional moroccan breakfast. The tajine at le Maroc restaurant is yummy but be ready to pay the price for eating in one of their nice alcoves. The jewel of the place though are the spa treatments you come out of with a shine and glow like I've rarely seen with the brand Maroc Maroc (pricey but I still have that glow :) ) and the cherry on top is the Serge Lutens perfume shop where I've found some rare gems that I've not seen on sale elsewhere.

The decor is stunningly beautiful the restaurants are top-notch the gardens are beautiful the fitness center is excellent the staff is generally great pool is spectacular. That said something is missing. For the outrageous nightly rate we paid we expected a little more in terms of service courtesy and the level of care given to guests. We did not always feel respectfully treated by the staff. Our (limited and very reasonable) requests were not always handled with care and there was just not an ""above and beyond"" attitude. I expected to be completely blown away by the Mamounia but by the end of my stay I found myself missing the quaint little Riad that I stayed in prior to my stay at the Mamounia. I do suggest staying here at least once in a lifetime but be sure to line your pockets with a mountain of cash only stay for a couple of days and do not leave the property on those days. For sightseeing and experiencing Moroccan culture stay elsewhere.

I found the rooms to be well decorated but surprisingly small. The slow wifi internet stopped working at night and I'm quite certain the heat did too.    While on site for 3 days my friends and I had gotten massages (although I can only describe it as an annoying rub down) by a ""masseuse"" that SAT DOWN during 1/2 of the ""massage""!! That's right! He was in a roller chair (like you see at a doctor's office) and would roll around me to rub oil in circular motions on my body. The best way to describe the experience was extremely annoying. I couldn't wait to get out of there! Its quite possibly the WORST massage I have ever received. Did I mention he was sick and kept snorting up his snot during my ""massage""? What was more disheartening is that once I brought this poor experience to management's attention- they didn't even as much as follow up. Not quite sure how they have received the high accolades they were awarded.    My friends and I spent most of our time at a near by hotel within the medina called hotel Maison de Arabe. Beautiful boutique hotel with a lovely spa and helpful staff- and less than 1/2 the price!! I plan on returning to Marrakech and booking here- you may want to consider doing the same.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Titillator wrote a review Dec 2011,50,"La Marocain Restaurant: The Best Moroccan Food, Ever!!",We couldn't find many reviews of La Marocain the Moroccan restaurant at La Mamounia. But I checked with a Moroccan friend of mine and she said it has the most amazing food.. and amazing it was!!    The hotel itself has some impressive public spaces and a fitting aperitif before dinner should be taken at the Italian bar where there is superb live jazz. After a professionally mixed cosmopolitan we walked into the gardens turned left and soon arrived at the separate building that houses La Marocain. Hostesses greeted us warmly and led us to a comfortable ground floor table. The tables are in clusters of pairs in separate alcoves which makes it all very relaxed.    The restaurant decor is divine. Traditional tiles on the floors beautiful arches high ceiling with 2 floors for dining and great traditional music from a local trio (the come and play to you in your table too). Service is also good with adequate amounts of attention and detailed explanation of the dishes.    But the food.. the food is just superb. I have eaten in many Norther African restaurants around the world but here it's in a different league.. or on the highest stratosphere! The menu is extensive with traditional dishes (much more than the ubiquitous couscous and tagine!) and also new interpretations of old favorites. We ordered the mix starters and we tasted nearly 30 little dishes from lamb brains (sounds bizarre but is amazingly creamy) to lamb liver (tender and well spiced) to pickled raw vegetables. For the main courses we have a poussin/baby chicken tagine that was expertly deboned and tender beyond belief and a strange giant ravioli stuffed with lentils and chicken (think: giant dim sum dumpling but tastier!!). Portions were so large that 4 could have feasted on our meal for 2!    Prices are high high high in this restaurant but you get what you pay for: QUALITY! The wine list is peppered with delicious local wines (we drank a lovely local red that is reminiscent of a top end Pinor Noir from California). And service music and ambience are of the highest standards.,Date of stay: November 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Titillator

La Mamounia Marrakech,ma02202014c wrote a review Nov 2011,50,Class,Arriving at this hotel getting out of a taxi on the street is a bit under-whelming. Once through the gate you see the hotel entrance proper and get a feel for what the rest of the hotel will be like. Check-in was efficient with dates and milk offered while the paper work was done. The public areas are rather dark but that does not seem out of keeping with the style of the hotel which seems intended to be like an arabian place.    I was upgraded to deluxe Katoubia view room that was located near the end of one of the first floor corridors. First impressions of the room were very good. Although not particularly spacious it had clearly been recently renovated in a style that gave it a character lacking in many hotels. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. A small verandah is equipped with a table and chairs giving a view of the Katoubia mosque. This side of the hotel only gets direct sun in the morning. The only downside of the room was the shower that is located in a small alcove near the bath. Spray from the shower will soak anything in the bathroom so keep stuff you want to stay dry in the bedroom.    Food and beverage wise drinks ($20 for a gin and tonic $10 for a beer) are available on the smallish outside terrace and the main bar that is located next to it. Service can sometimes be a bit slow. The restaurants all have a good choice of high quality dishes - with prices to match. Wine starts at $50 a bottle. Probably the best experience was breakfast. This is served by the pool with choice from a very extensive buffet of hot and cold dishes ($45).    The highlight of the hotel is the immaculately kept and extensive grounds including orange groves and a kitchen garden. It is possible to escape some of the noise near the pool by using the sun-loungers in one of the orange groves.    This 'grande dame' of Marrakech lives up to its reputation. As is the case with other 5 star properties you will need fairly deep pockets but it is certainly worth experincing.,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled solo,England,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ma02202014c
La Mamounia Marrakech,Gondwanian wrote a review Nov 2011,40,"Impressive, despite a few flaws","La Mamounia is probably the most iconic hotel of Marrakech up there with the Negresco in Nice the Imperial in Delhi or the Mount Nelson in Cape Town to name just a few. The hotel lies in the Medina the old heart of Marrakech with its expansive garden bordered by one of the city walls. The Koutoubia and Place Jemaa el Fnaa are just a 10 minute walk away as well as the modern city outside the walls. Great location in short.  Once inside you'll find lobby and reception with all food options and the spa left and right of this central area. The decoration is plush with lots of very cozy seats cushions and thick carpets. There is not much lighting so some people might find it a bit dark.  Behind the building is an immense manicured garden with the pool the breakfast restaurant tennis courts fitness centre and a 'potager' where all herbs and vegetables for use in the hotel's kitchen are grown.  Rooms are located in both wings from the ground floor up to the fourth. Rooms on the ground floor are even a bit 'underground' lower than the garden level and have a patio with access to that garden. Rooms on the higher floors have quite a large balcony ... and the higher you go the better the view over the garden and the snow capped peaks of the Atlas mountains.  Room decoration is very Morrocan with marble floors and bathrooms carpets and walls adorned with colourful glazed tiles. A really wonderful bed with a large choice of pillows a deep tub (so deep you can't really lie down ... you're practically sitting up which is less relaxing) a large rain shower flatscreen control over all lights from the bedside table (and no overload of buttons) perfect cleaning (even twice a day I had the impression) with evening turndown ...  So where are the ""flaws"" you probably wonder ? Here they are :  Check-in is from 3 PM and due to the autumn holidays and the hotel being full I really had to wait until 3. You know so that's not an issue ... but it then took four calls to reception and a full hour to get my luggage just five minutes before I had a meeting outside the hotel.  WiFi is dramatic. There was no network available from the work desk only from the middle of the bed or in the sitting area far away from the plugs. When I managed to get a connection it soon dropped to 1 mbps about the speed of an ancient dial-up before breaking up altogether. Don't forget a network cable it's absolutely necessary ! Maybe it was because I was on the fourth floor...  On my departure day the first knock on the door came at 8 am (cleaning). Right out of the shower I told the lady I'd be leaving at 10 am... but in the space of 2 hours three other people came in to start cleaning. Finally at 9.55 another lady came in and I finished packing while she already started cleaning. I really think they wanted me out of room.

Public areas like an airport  6 plenty unmanaged lazy staff.  7 depressingly quiet and few lights on in rooms.  8 our beverages of hot chocolate and soft drinks took 35 minutes to arrive and were respectively cold and warm (no ice!!!!).  Conclusion - senior management clueless as to what is required for a decent 5* hotel - its called Savoir faire!

La Mamounia Marrakech,yvo28 wrote a review Sep 2011,50,Amazing,We spent a week here in April. The hotel was absolutely stunning and the service was the best we have had anywhere. There were no glitches - everything was perfect all the time. Our room had a terrace which looked over the hotel gardens. We had breakfast there every morning which was such a nice way to start the day. We lunched at the pool a number of times which although pricey is just fantastic in terms of the massive selection of food and the people watching. We dined in all the hotel restaurants and loved them all - especially the French. The staff are all so genuinely charming and relaxed yet completely professional and attentive. You are made to feel very welcome indeed.,Date of stay: April 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,glasgow,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yvo28
La Mamounia Marrakech,PeterAZ wrote a review Sep 2011,30,Very disappointed,Whilst the hotel and grounds are beautiful the rooms are the worst value and most disappointing I have ever had in a 5-star hotel and certainly not worth $1000 a night. The bedrooms are small and cramped. Even worse are the bathrooms which are tiny with the absolute worst shower I have ever had in any hotel anywhere. You actually have to turn off the water to soap up and since there is no shower door the floor of the bathroom gets soaked.,Date of stay: May 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Scottsdale,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeterAZ

La Mamounia Marrakech,hannahwadsworth wrote a review Sep 2011,50,Like a dream !!,I have never been to a hotel so wonderful!!! The service was 5*. The size of the pool is huge and its stunning. We were not there for peak season and so it was quite empty which was a bit of a shame as the atmosphere would of been nice and when we went to the spa they had to turn everything on for us which was a little wierd. Considering the hotel had few guests the service could of been more attentive. Before i went i was given the impression they dont leave you alone - this was not what we experienced (which was good) but it did take quite a while to get any service by the pool and to figure out how the sun loungers worked.    Fresh fruit in the room every day was lovely. You feel like your in a bubble in La Mamounia however quite a large bubble as we almost needed a map to find our way around. The gardens were gorgeous and is also where the hotel grows its own veg to serve at dinner every evening. We ate in both the French and Italian michelin star restaurants the hotel has and both were delicious (as to be expected i suppose).

Now the Mamounia is just a dream. Luxurious rooms of french taste with a local touch and incredible views on the garden and the snow-covered Atlas mountains perfect and friendly service starting with the Limousine pickup at the airport fantastic food and a great pool.

La Mamounia Marrakech,DoryRome wrote a review Aug 2011,50,Completely breathtaking,We found the Mamounia completely breathtaking. The hotel is lush opulent and beautiful with indoor fountains lots of public spaces and seating deep red colours and soft shaded table-lamps. Our room was beautiful a good size with a private terrace overlooking the magnificent gardens. The restoration work has retained the room’s Moroccan charm. The bathroom was large but the shower not enclosed so the water fell directly on the tilled floor really not practical. As was the fact that all light switches were now fitted with dimmers so you had to wait until you got the right amount of light. Breakfast at the pool with service plus buffet was wonderful the service perfect. In fact the service was excellent throughout the hotel. A great advantage of the Mamounia is that it is within the ancient walls of Marakesh and very close to the Central Square and souk market yet with a vast well-maintained and peaceful garden and glittering swimming pool which makes it a real haven. The short walk to the souk is very pleasant especially in the evening. We ate once at the Italian restaurant which was well-frequented and the food was good though more decorative than filling after a long day.

The hotel is amazing. It is designed beautifully and is set in Royal Gardens. It has a very regal feel about it (Winston Churchill was a fan).    We received impeccable service and I can see why it’s been voted the best hotel in the world. After an expensive Mojito (cocktails are priced between £15 - 30 GBP) we headed into the Churchill Bar. The bar was empty except for a Jazz singer and her band member. She was fantastic and she really engaged with our group.

The awesome - walking in the grounds after a week spent travelling around the deserts having an icecream and playing ping pong with the kids at the health club.    The great - the rooms beds linen bathrooms and little gifts (thongs pens key wallet) - and the Italian restaurant early morning transfer. No compromises to meet the highest possible standards.    The ordinary - the lady who told our well intentioned driver (and our family) to go away (in a tone that I did not need language skills to understand) because we pulled up at the side entrance (in our very dusty 4WD) even though we had started to unload our kit.

I have to say that La Mamounia deserves its rating and reputation. Of course it is expensive so let's put that to one side. The property is magnificent. No detail was spared in the recent renovation. The staff could not have been more accommodating (the hotel was only about 15% full in the low season so I expect we received extra attention). It is truly a piece of paradise on Earth.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Super2000 wrote a review Jun 2011,50,Experience of a lifetime,"Luckily for me I was invited to attend a business trip for a week staying at La Mamounia. The hotel is an experience of a lifetime in itself nevermind the location. The place has a very special ambience - being by/in the enormous outdoor pool was one of the most relaxing experiences I've ever had. The indoor pool was similarly magical. For culture pop down the road and experience the Morroccan Market souks and I'd highly recommend the old university in the city for absolutely stunning internal architecture. We were lucky enough to have an executive suite - loads of space great views huge comfortable bed clean and attentive service. (Though a short knock and the polite and friendly staff are in!). Sleep quality great - but If you choose to sleep in the day there is the occasional call from the nearby mosque! The Churchill Bar has a special feel to it very old world classic charm - and it is worth shelling out for a mojito or a whisky in there to listen to the world class music and relax in an old haunt of various historic and musical greats. Watch your footing as all the floors are hard marble or stone but the decor post-refurb is magnificent throughout the hotel. The food is great (the breakfasts are A.MA.ZING - especially the Eggs Florentine!) though I'd imagine you'd pay £150 per head for a 3 course meal (and even a buffet lunch if you don't pick your options carefully) and I think club style lunch by the pool was around £25 pp minimum. (There is a supermarket 10 mins down the road ""Label Vie"" and a McDonalds come to that as well as a series of beautiful restaurants with great food of all nationalities but if you do choose to pop in to the supermarket be courteous to hotel etiquette and hide your stash in your rucksack). The orchard garden and formal planting was fab and I'd highly recommend the tennis courts and yoga classes (3 times a week 830am).

La Mamounia Marrakech,VoxVolpe wrote a review Jun 2011,40,Historical Opulence,Winston Churchill loved this hotel and garden and who am I to argue with him. It is not perfect and sometimes the service lacks in certain regards but overall I would not hesitate to stay in this historical hotel that is beautiful beyond measure. Some have said the rooms are dark I disagree and think they fit the feeling of the environment and I found the Moroccon theme charming and appropriate. The bathrooms are beautiful and the details we had in the room were outstanding. The fit and finish is certainly great and the overall feel both in the hotel and garden gives one a feeling of being somewhere and someone special. Room service was less than perfect the bar staff were slow but the restaurant was excellent in both food and service. I also liked being in the city as we put this trip together with a stay at the Amanjena and I think that was perfect combination.

After two nights two room changes and a whole catalogue of annoyances bad service and various things not working we asked to check out so that we could move to another hotel. They insisted they would charge us for the remaining two nights we had booked. It wasn't until we had kicked up a big fuss that the front office manager conceded not to charge us. We made peace and agreed to change rooms one more time to one where things worked. It was like night and day - for the remainder of our stay staff were polite attentive and pleasant. We received excellent service and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.    If you do decide to book beware: The showers in the garden rooms are so tiny that your entire bathroom and hall gets flooded. Apart from room service it is impossible to get a light meal in the evening. The Italian Bar only serves until 6pm. All the other restaurants are extremely pricey. Book on a B&B basis - breakfasts are ridiculously expensive. Ground floor garden rooms look out onto a wooden trellis blocking the view to the garden. There is precious little privacy.

La Mamounia Marrakech,WilliamTarrington wrote a review Mar 2011,50,A Grand Dame reinvented,La Mamounia is a tour de force of high Morrocan style and old world glamour. Anyone who says it is tired and outdated obviously has not visited since the renevotion. The hotel along with the entire city of Marrakesh are experiencing a renaissance; the restaurants are at their finest the service attentive and the gardens/ public areas are meticulously cared for. Marrakesh and the hotel far exceeded my expectations.But now onto the little things    PROS: - huge and expansive gardens and pool area; after a long day of sightseeing the tranquil gardens and the smell of orange blossoms were the perfect anectdote to the hustle and bustle of the town.  - great rooms; very large and seem to live up to their steep price.  - services offered by the hotel; private cars excursions guides all of these very nice  - amazing spa area with hammam and the works    CONS:  - good location but still a taxi ride to the main souqs and the square; walking only takes 5-10 min but it is on the edge of the medina  - low lighting throughout entire hotel; the light in the bathroom is equivalent to that of an iPhone and i found myself looking for things in the dark  - outrageous prices for lunch and breakfast( not even that good only a buffet)  - jacuzzi is never hot; after requesting to have it warmer it never changed  - a few things here and there with service; asked for adaptors that never were delivered and constant visits from housekeeping    overall although my con list is longer that pros we had an enjoyable and positive stay.

Our room had terrific blackout shades and really kept the sunlight out for good sleeping. My only complaint about the room is that is was very dark in the hall and bathroom even with all the lights turned on... so finding your things in the closet etc. was difficult...

I visited for the first this past Christmas and New Years it is such a beautiful place. The hotel is spotlessly clean Beautifully designed and has every amenity you can dream of. The most Beautiful spa With one of the most incredible indoor swimming pools with gold leafed columned moorish arched corridors. The out door swimming pool is also incredible. The rooms are stunning ask to see the churchill suite if its available it is the room that winston churchill stayed in on his trips to Morocco they have one of his paintings on the wall and his pipe and top hat in a lucite case.  This hotel really has everything you could ever want the hotel has a mini rodeo drive in the lobby with a Cartier Gucci Fendi Louis Vuitton Dior and several other jewelry stores. You don't have to leave the hotel and probably wont want to because of the incredible beauty of the hotel itself but when you do finally stop exploring the various casinos restaurants bars shops and acres and acres of beautiful gardens and orchards you step out the front gate of the hotel and you are right in the center of the city it is probably a five or max ten minute walk to the Medina where the snake charmers and great little shops are. and much much more!

The hotel is located in the medina and though it misses the charm of a riad it is absolutely stunning. I love that you can walk through the busy town from here and then relax in the beautiful garden afterwards. The rooms are a bit overpriced considering that you can get your own pavillion at other hotels for a little extra money. I also reccomend a room with a view of the garden since I found the rooms that have a view over Koutoubia quite noisy.  The spa offers great treatments though I found it quite dark confusing and modern.  Eventhough I stayed here when it was fully booked the service was always amazing.  Le Marrocain restaurant is absolutely delicious and is in a wonderful setting (especially when it is warm out and you can sit outside) Do not skip the assortment of Moroccan salads to start. All and all I was very happy with the hotel but would consider a different place next time to switch it up.  http://thedopeblog.blogspot.com/2010/05/marrakech.html,Date of stay: November 2010,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thdopeblog

I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had known what was going to take place as far as the ""royal treatment"" was. The scrub was rough I will not kid you. But my skin did feel vibrant afterwards. We did have one slight problem with a tour that the hotel set up but because my husband was persistent we did get it worked out.

Service was excellent although one could suggest it was marginally over attentive which I could put down to the hotel being in low season so the staff guest ratio was even higher than normal.  The French restaurant was first class and the pool restaurant was also excellent.  The hotel however as you would expect is expensive (a bottle of the local beer was £8) so be prepared to open the wallet.  One thing I would highlight if you leave the hotel to visit the souks. Whatever you do get a guide organized by the hotel. We got approached within 30 seconds of leaving the hotel by a local guide touting for business and by the time we'd got rid of him we got hassled by a further three in turn over the space of 15 minutes which spoilt our walk into the medina. They don't take no for an answer.,Date of stay: July 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,edinburgh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tjigiii

If you're going to Marrakech and you don't put on your gladrags and splash out on a trip to the Mamounia you'll be missing a rare treat.    Forget the Burj al Arab it's appaling in every sense.

La Mamounia Marrakech,dgraham wrote a review Aug 2010,50,A Truly Great Hotel Experience,We have stayed at La Mamounia twice for a total of 15 days and consider it to be an absolutely outstanding hotel. We had a room with a terrace which gave the room spaciousness.  The hotel transports you to another world where you are treated like royalty. The pool is roughly 25 meters by 25 meters which is wonderful for lap swimming.  My wife considers it her favorite hotel in the world. She loves the decor the restaurants the spa the gym the grounds and the exceptional service.  The negative reviews we read must have referred to the hotel prior to the 2009 renovation.  The hotel is pricey but we couldn't give a hotel a better recommendation.  P.S.

La Mamounia Marrakech,CQM_9 wrote a review Aug 2010,30,"STARTED ON A HIGH, LEFT DISAPPOINTED",STARTED ON A HIGH LEFT DISAPPOINTED    This is a fantastic example of how a fantastic stay in a perfect hotel can be ruined by one person. I agree with the other reviews I have read. No wonder this hotel is ranked way down at #151 and keeps sinking lower as months go by    A breathtaking hotel with the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE FRONT DESK STAFF in the continent!! What a shame.    Check in went smoothly.    Room was a bit smaller than expected (given the price tag of their rooms)  But the balcony was a great feature and gave us a fantastic view of the amazing grounds and gardens of La Mamounia. The bathroom is quite luxurious.    From the on-set the service was exceptional and the staff in ALL THE RESTAURANTS provided exceptional service. Room service was great too.    UNFORTUNATELY THE FRONT DESK STAFF (a girl named Fatima to be specific) will drag the service down.. On my last night loving my stay at this hotel  I approached CUSTOMER SERVICE and was inquiring about transport to the airport. And this really sour-faced manager rudely told me- “not here- go to them” . And when I asked another question I was rudely told again to ask someone else. At this point I was really frustrated and left. There are POLITE ways of telling hotel guests where to get info- and this Fatima girl had this additional irritated tone as if I was bothering her. And the hotel assigned her to the customer service desk? I think this will be the down fall of the hotel . This encounter really put a sour note on an otherwise enjoyable stay at the hotel. Like a dark cloud on an otherwise sunny day at the beach    The saga continues the morning we checked out I reported the incident to another girl in the front desk and asked to speak to their superior- she disappeared for 10 minutes and came back saying she was unable to find their supervisor/ manager . But rest assured she will e-mail me a feedback. So I left her all my contact details.    2 months since the incident I have NOT heard back from the hotel . Not a word.    Again situations like this ruins an otherwise great stay and making us wish we just dined at the hotel and stayed at another 5 start hotel with service to match..,Date of stay: May 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Philippines,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CQM_9
La Mamounia Marrakech,Azzoubears wrote a review Jul 2010,20,There's a reason...,...why this self proclaimed 'best hotel of Morocco' is ranked #143 and not #1. If it were up to me it would kicked down even lower. The building is amazing the gardens stunning and the rooms beautiful and clean. Nobody can deny that.    But what a terrible service and what a snobby staff! For the prices you pay here you expect to be treated with utmost care but all the staff from top management down to the waiters absolutely showed no care whatsoever! And we didn't even ask that much! All we wanted was to make sure our meals have not been cooked with anything containing meat and for the cleaning ladies to respect the 'dont disturb' sign! And we also expected people to speak at least a bit of English. You think they'd be able to afford people who do at those room prices.    The dress code is a horrible thing to implement especially when it's hot. My husband was denied entrance twice to the hotel while we were paying top dollar for our room!! All because he put on some light colorful clothes to cope with the heat. And you'd think management would care about paying clients? Think again. The arrogance of that hotel is unmatched anywhere.    Would definitely not go back. And from the reviews I have read here I don't seem to be the only one complaining about staff and service. We were lucky to be able to dine at the new Royal Mansour and God what an incredible hotel with incredible service and staff!

We came to marrakech for 6 days first at a riad and then to end our holiday at La Mamounia.    The hotel is beautifullydecirated with a breathtaking lobby cummunal areas garden and rooms. The hotel is understandably pricey no two ways about it. Drinks are around €15 for a gin and tonic. Service was very poor in the bar not knowing if they had ginger ale or not giving me much ice when I specifically asked for it.    The bedroom was beautiful and could not fault it. Very spacious and very very clean. The marble bathroom was amasing.    The staff are more snotty than the guests and this was a put off. The maid came to us upon checking out and basically had her hand out for a tip. I mentioend this o the front desk who took it all in their stride not seeming to care one bit.  When you pay these sort of prices you expect above average service whcih did not seem to refelct the quality of the hotel.  This is without doubt a very beautiful but expensive hotel.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Teigne wrote a review Jun 2010,50,"Haven of quiet, refinement, and luxury",My best friend and I spent 2 nights at La Mamounia last week after a 3-day climb of Mt Toubkal. I could not imagined a better place to relax! The service was at all times excellent: although I am French and all employees speak perfect French they were happy to speak english to us for my friend. We were welcomed warmly although we were dropped off from a dusty SUV in our hiking clothes. The food was excellent (breakfast buffet with Moroccan beignets!) and the room service lightning quick. We enjoyed the opulent spa every day as well as the stunning pools (with a out-of-this world day bed above the indoor pool). The room and all public spaces are extremely well appointed with amazing attention to details (wood and plaster carvings intricate tilework). The location is amazing: just a very short walk to the main mosque and the buzzing main square yet ensconced in the quiet of a wonderful park.    The prices really do not matter at this point. This was an amazing experience far better than any of the Four Seasons I have been to.

La Mamounia Marrakech,damonshouse wrote a review Jun 2010,40,An Amazing and Beautiful Hotel with some minor issues,My partner and I stayed in a suite as this hotel just after Christmas so we were there for the New Year. The suite we had was stunning it was the most beautiful room and hotel I have ever stayed in. The rooms were clean and well looked after. The gardens were beautiful and swimming pool area was also lovely. There were surprisingly some language problems and I am not sure if this is because the hotel had recently re-opened after some refurbishment. My partner and I do not speak French and virtually all staff and most of the guests were French. We had a lot of language problems. Ordering a pot of hot English tea became so difficult that in the end we found it funny but for a hotel of this quality and expense you should be able to get what ever you want and not have communication problems. My partner had a leakage in his luggage so we had all his shirts cleaned by the hotel unfortunately because of language issues the hotel lost the clothes for 3 days and our representative had to get involved to speak to room service who did not understand us at all. Another thing which really got to us was that apparently when the hotel opened after its refurb it opened as a non-smoking hotel but the French would not have it at all so it became a smoking hotel which was such a shame. Every time we were in a restaurant bar or by the pool we were surrounded by smokers. Apart from these problems though it was a lovely hotel and a very interesting country. We would go back.,Date of stay: January 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Weybridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/damonshouse

Pool is hugewarm and fantastic for a lengthly swim. La Mamounia is first class all the way. Very expensive to eat (think $25USD burger near the pool) but restaurants are great. We dined at their Moroccan restaurant which was stylish and they had traditional live music too. Can't say it was the 'best' moroccan meal but it was very good. Lovely to sit in the lounge and have a cocktail before dinner while listening to a jazz trio. We felt very pampered and 'royal' during our stay.

The gardens are fabulous and the rooms especially the beds are just what one would expect from Jacques Garcia.    However we were completely and utterly disappointed with lunch and dinner. The breakfast was just O.K. but nothing to write home about. One would expect that they would have hired the best chefs in the biz. Hotels of this caliper should have fabulous food not average.    The management was top notch but the wait staff at the restaurants were green and undertrained. Everyone was all smiles and extremely friendly.

Marble glass and perilously low lighting conspire to create the impression that you could be almost anywhere. There simply seems no point in staying here if you are a leisure traveller to Marrakech which is after all filled with marvellous Riads. The best thing about La M is the gardens filled with roses orange and olive trees all beautifully tended. So come here for tea perhaps for dinner if you must or just wander the gardens for free.

La Mamounia Marrakech,Dobbie66 wrote a review Dec 2009,20,Dreadful experience,Booked a single night at the end of a 7 night Marrakech stay - first 6 nights in beautifully restored Riad perfect!!! 2 days prior to our check-in date for La Mamounia we decided to stop in for a mid-morning coffee to discover that due to my husbands vacation attire ( linen shorts and shirt!! ) we were not welcome at the hotel. When asked if they then wanted to cancel our reservation the gate guard finally relented. We experienced various confused and inefficient staff in a large imposing quiet and very dark interior of a beautiful old palace. Such a disappointing experience after much anticipation. Discussed their strict dress code with a 'Guest Relations Manageress' - she arrogantly believed that they are not required to inform people who may be booking their hotel of their strict dress code as it's simply a matter of 'common decency' that guests dress appropriately for such a grand environment - so when I challenged her about our impending stay she said that once we had checked in we would be free to wear shorts or whatever we wanted... in some strange fashion she seems to be able to differentiate in her mind between what's appropriate for visitors to wear / do and what paying guests can wear / do... and while we weren't welcome that day or the next... we would be very welcome on the day of check-in despite the shorts..... GIVE ME A BREAK!!! In general terms the place felt cold haughty austere - not in any way welcoming. It was extremely dark although beautifully decorated in an overly ornate way - even the staff repeatedly tripped up over the thick carpets. Very beautiful gardens swimming pool area - unfortunately I can't report about the rooms as I ended up cancelling my stay due to their very exclusionary dress code which could never feel comfortable for people who enjoy a more relaxed approach to life - I believe there are way important things in life than worrying about whether we have appropriate clothing esp while on vacation! I cancelled the reservation due to their intolerance of my husband's vacation attire - but they happily still charge us the full nights stay - our attire may not be welcome but there's obviously nothing wrong with our money!! But bless their hearts - they did inform me that it was ' with regret' that they would have to charge me for the non-stay...

La Mamounia Marrakech,ChrisG57 wrote a review Nov 2009,10,Abysmal stay,"I was greeted to the hotel by no less than seven guest relations managers...then left to wait late at night for 45 minutes before being shown to my room. All seven asked me when I would like to check out  as if I had a choice. Then told that all restaurants were shut but that I could have room service - at Euros 45 for a hamburger or club sandwich! On opening the minibar I found five half drunk bottles of water; on complaining to the manager I was told ""don't worry Sir we won't charge you for them"". On trying to close the curtains I found out the hard way by ripping my back that the curtain hold-backs had no ends on them exposing jagged edges. I bypassed breakfast at another Euros 35 a head but decided to try the (totally empty) Italian restaurant. I was told abruptly that I could come back in 40 minutes. Returning (to find the restaurant still empty)I was served prawns that I could smell approaching rotting on the plate. I was then served a lump of very dead fish which was inedible. On leaving the restaurant I refused to pay for the prawns that were shown on the bill. On checking out I found the same prawns still on my check out bill. I have to admit I lost it big time at this point and demanded to see the manager; even that took ten minutes of intervening guest relations managers. A dreadful shame.

La Mamounia Marrakech,amigo42 wrote a review Nov 2009,40,"Beautiful restored palace in central Marrakech, but service not convincing",I was before in Marrakech and that hotel was not very good. See also my review of a few years ago. The Mamounia was closed for renovations at that time. So this time I was curious what to expect about the hotel.  Well the hotel is beautiful. Everything is new stylish french and morrocan style. I heard some people saying they considered it dark inside but I liked it. We had a beautiful suite with all the modern comforts in it. The outside of the hotel is not spectacular but for the inside great care is taken.  The food was great we had lunch at the pool restaurant had our breakfast there to with everything you can imagine available and fresh. One evening we had dinner at the Moroccan restaurant also very good. The location is very convenient in Marrakech just a short walk to the souks and square. The garden is great the pool big with water on right temperature (not to cold). The costumes of the staff are a delight to look at. The staff is also cooperative and friendly except..... when something goes out of the schedule. Then they all seem to paralize and don't know what to do. One day they forget to service our room. It took me 2 calls and 2 visits to reception and concierge desk to get it organized. Another thing Mamounia is not cheap however I didn't compared the place with others so I don't have a fair judgement other then prices seems steep to me.

The hotel has been completely redesigned (Jacques Garcia) and is indescribably beautiful. It's like an Eden. The room (a parkview suite) was extremely luxurious but also comfortable.

In the moroccan restaurant and the lunch buffet (poolside) it's fantastic; admittedly the Italian restaurant was just okay. We loved it here so much it was one of those trips where we just never wanted to leave the hotel. We have stayed all over the world in some truly great hotels. Four Seasons in Istanbul and the Peninsula in Beijing were previously our top rated. La Mamounia has beat them both for its sheer beauty. It is VERY expensive but worth every penny.

Forget about paying by credit card - the hotel will claim your card has been declined and force you into one of their cars escorting you to an assortment of ATM's to retrieve the cash to pay your bill while your luggage has been confiscated until every last Durham has been paid.

Make sure you get a refund from your credit card when you return home and even consider joining the growing swell of travellers who consider it an insult that this third-rate-den-of-robbers ever should have been considered ""a leading hotel of the world.""",Date of stay: March 2006,,Marbella,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/louisduval
La Mamounia Marrakech,John David O wrote a review Mar 2006,50,An oasis that worth a visit.,Every time I think of Morocco I think... “Boy is hot there in September!” Actually what I really reminisce about is the very enjoyable stay I had at La Mamounia. We decided we wanted to stay at La Mamounia for historical reasons. I'm a big fan of Winston Churchill and we had just been in London for week which included a visit to the new Churchill museum.    We had a junior suite on the top floor overlooking the pool and the gardens just around the corner from the suite where Winston Churchill used to stay and paint on the terrace. Every morning when I wake up in Los Angeles I reflect on the wonderful breakfasts of juice coffee and croissants sitting on the terrace on the top floor overlooking the pool and the lush 40 acres of gardens. I can still smell the fresh pastries and see the palms trees shifting easily in the morning breeze. I remember thinking that I could be content waking up like this every morning.    I loved the design of the hotel; all the fountains with fresh rose petals and the craftsmanship of the extraordinary tile work. I found the service was quite pleasant but not exceptional.,Date of stay: September 2004,,"Sydney, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/john1000usa
La Mamounia Marrakech,aBitParticular wrote a review Jan 2006,40,Grand hotel!,La Mamounia is unique in Marrakech it has enormous grounds with a beautiful garden many restaurants (the Moroccan one is fantastic as is the old school cocktail bar). The hotel is in need of a renovation but it still has plenty of charm. Don't expect state of the art (you're in Morrocco after all) but do expect a grand hotel with a rich history and beautiful surroundings.    It's not really comparable to a Riad they're two completely different experiences. If you're going to Marrakech and prefer a big hotel to a small guesthouse you'll have trouble finding a place with more character.,Date of stay: November 2005,,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aBitParticular
La Mamounia Marrakech,Porkers wrote a review Jan 2006,40,La Mamounia,Many reviews of this hotel focus on the price and how expensive everything is from the food to the price of the rooms. Yes - it is expensive. No - you do not have to stay there. For anyone who is watching the pennies I would advise seriously to give this place a wide berth. For those lucky enough not to have to worry too much about the old bank account I would say go and enjoy yourself. This is one superb hotel. It certainly prefers to cater for the well-healed in that if you are going to complain about eveything from the price of a plate of spagetti to the cost of a dash of soda in your scotch then they would rather you stayed elsewhere and I would guess they are pretty good at letting you know it. We stayed at La Mamounia for 4 nights in January 2006 and we found the service excellent and the staff friendly and helpful. We ate in the Italian restaurant the poolside restaurant and the Moroccan restaurant and the food in all three was superb. We also enjoyed our stay in the Ambassador suite which consisted of a large double bedroom with ensuite jacuzzi bath and separate wc a large sitting room / dining room and a double balcony overlooking the pool the gardens and the wonderful snow-capped Atlas mountains beyond. Pity it rained most of the time (do take warm clothes if you visit Morocco in January)  The hotel itself is a bit kitsch but who cares? Its like a bit of theatre - everywhere you turn is another stage set. I believe most of what you see within the walls of the hotel is repro but what's the alternative another dreary Pond hotel?,Date of stay: January 2006,,Scotland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Porkers

After staying at a gorgeous Riad in Marrakech for 3 nights we stayed at La Mamounia because I had heard about the place since I was a little girl...what a disappointment!

La Mamounia Marrakech,DUA wrote a review Oct 2005,10,Building work,There's no doubt that La Mamounia is pretty in places and the rooms on the whole are nice though more than a little bit tacky with a cheap art deco look. The biggest risk at the moment is that they'll stick you in a room near their ongoing renovation programme - the hammering starts at 7:30 am and runs throughout the day. For most hotels I'd perhaps consider this just a blemish but when you are paying as much money as you are to stay here it is just cheek on their part. With coercion they may move you to another room but for a hotel that is supposedly one of the best in the world it shouldn't be necessary. The Italian restaurant is outstanding though very expensive especially if you are not prepared to drink Moroccan wine.,Date of stay: October 2005,,"Street, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DUAPhoto

La Mamounia Marrakech,JFK001 wrote a review Oct 2005,20,Prices way out of reason !,"We came with high expectations (given the price of the room we booked...) the room was large (albeit nothing remarkable) a nice little terrace sightseeing the beautiful gardens. The pool area was nice although it is a pity they have not managed to integrate more activities within the beautiful gardens (like a second pool). We have found the staff very good from the poolboys to the room-maid waiters are reasonably ok.That's about all i could say positive on this old palace.  Indeed I think this hoitel is living only on its long-dated - but way out-dated - reputation. It has an atmosphere of something old apparently the 50's...the whole deco is really ""kitsch"".  The big issue in this hotel is the price of ..everything and in particular the food (some example: a spaghetti bolognese was EUR 20 !!! a lunch at the swimming pool (mixed grills and salad bar) for two was in excess of EUR 100!!)  For sure we will never go at la Mamounia again...and i can hardly think of any type of traveller I could recommend it to...",Date of stay: September 2005,,Luxembourg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JFK001
La Mamounia Marrakech,wheeeeetos wrote a review Sep 2005,30,Nice Rooms but Extortionate food prices!,We have just returned from staying the Mamounia. It is supposed to be the best hotel in Marrakech. Having heard good and bad we want with an open mind. There are ups and downs. The room was lovely especially the terrace with the view of the gardens but altogether not very Moroccan. The pool area was also nice as were the restaurants. In contrast to some of the other reviewers we found the service exceptionally good (and we are fussy customers!). However – and it’s a big however – the food is extortionately priced beyond any comparison or reason! For the famous lunch buffet – we paid over 100 Euros – and that was for a bit of soggy salad and a skewer! What a rip off! The dinner in the Italian was actually very good – but for 150 Euros (having had only a half bottle of wine) it was unreasonable. Oh – and then there are the herds of tourist are bussed in to walk around and take of photos of everything – most annoying. It’s a old school place but that’s part of its charm.,Date of stay: September 2005,,"Frankfurt, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wheeeeetos

The last time I stayed at La Mamounia I was appalled at how this once incredible hotel had deteriorated. It seems to cater primarily to package tours  from Belgium.

La Mamounia Marrakech,French wrote a review Mar 2005,40,We still like it!,This hotel is a kind of historical place in Marrakech.  We've been there twice and won't hesitate to go back apart from rooms prices which are very very expensive.    Both times we had a pool view room and enjoyed every minute of our stay.  Service is excellent.  Good restaurant for lunch not far from the pool. We also like the Morrocan restaurant although you can find better options in town.    We specially like the park and like to wander around.    Two other things we love is watching the Atlas mountains in the background from our balcony and watching swallows at sunset looking for a place to sleep (generally in the nearby trees or just underneath the wooden top of our balcony...).,Date of stay: May 2002,,"Paris, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/French

La Mamounia Marrakech,josephone wrote a review Feb 2005,10,a poor hotel,we stayed in this hotel in mid-January. the night we arrived we were given a room overlooking the street (a courtyard room) which had a radiator which would not turn off. The windows had to remain open all night. in the morning the bath tub turned brown from the water.    we asked for another room and had to pay about $150 a night more for it. the place was filled with French weekenders who were horrible. we were invited to a cocktail party but not allowed in because we were not dressed well enough. many of the french were not allowed in but they all were brought champagne as compensation. we had to pay for a cup of tea.    after the weekenders left and we paid for a room with a bath with clean water the hotel was much nicer.    we would never recommend this hotel. it was a huge waste of money and time and was not as spectacular as we had been told. Palais Jamai in Fes is much more beautiful.    Josephine,Date of stay: January 2005,,"missoula, montana",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josephone

La Mamounia Marrakech,edith1911 wrote a review Dec 2004,20,"No atmosphere, bad area of town",The Mamounia has definitely seen better times. It's hard to compete with all the fantastic new riads in the medina and the Mamounia doesn't succeed. The hotel lacks atmosphere and style. It is neither in the atmospheric medina nor in the quiet palmerie. Instead it's on a very busy street in an unpleasant part of town. Pool and garden are nice but nothing compared to other hotels in that price range like Les Deux Tours. It might be a good hotel for conferences but not for those looking for some maroccan atmosphere.,,,Amsterdam,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edith1911

La Mamounia Marrakech,Luca R wrote a review Aug 2004,40,Room on the sunset and avoidable restaurant,Been there three nights from August 19th 2004.  Position: perfect just inside the Medina (the historic center withing the ancient walls) less than half a mile from the main square Jema El Fnaa and the souk (the market).  Service: perfect helpful.  Concierge: wise (ask him for the right restaurant – I suggest: «Dar Moha» – and for a good taxi driver – prefer a big taxi than the “Petit Taxis” and agree on a fee of no more than 100dirhams for a return ride inside the Medina).  The park is very well groomed though not huge: a real oasis in the hellish (especially in summertime) Marrakech.  The heated swimming pool (kept at 27/28 degrees Celsius throughout the year): service very good but the pool itself is lacking of the proper maintenance since many tiles are broken and you may risk a foot. Inadmissible for a 5-star hotel member of the Leadings.  What room to prefer: if you like sunsets choose a room on the north side the less expensive (about 2000dirhams (190Eur)/night excluding breakfast which I suggest to avoid and opt for something at the Patisserie Des Princes in the rue Bab Agnaou close to the Jema El Fnaa) and the only ones with a view on the sunset.  Beautiful rooms about 30sqm with a great bathroom (with engraved doors). Do not expect something modern: rooms are likely to be in a very similar shape to that when this hotel was a Winston Churchill’s favourite more than half a century ago.  The most expensive rooms are those facing the swimming pool and afterwards those on the park: unjustified.  In a descending scale those with view on the Koutoubia Mosque: justified if you are a muslim.  What to avoid: the Moroccan restaurant «Le Restaurant Marocaine de la Mamounia». Good show with typical music and a belly dancer but avoidable and unremarkable food for the price you pay (average w/out drinks: 600dirhams/55Eur per person).  Prefer if you dare the collective restaurant that appears in the evenings in the Jema El Fnaa (I have tried the stall no. 114) where two people can be satisfied with good food (and a wonderful cous cous) for as much as 4 Eur per person drinks included: but make sure to have an health insurance first!  The casino does not required a tie nor a jacket (though is written so on the paper – but the same is written regarding the restaurants). You can access the slot machines even in swimsuit. The only limitation is to the tables of traditional games (like roulette or blackjack): open shoes like sandals are not admitted so you have to choose between Birkenstocks and the shivers of gambling.  If you like shopping inside the hotel there is the only Louis Vuitton store in Africa (but they told me another one is opening soon in South Africa).,,,"Genoa, Italy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LucaRuggiero
