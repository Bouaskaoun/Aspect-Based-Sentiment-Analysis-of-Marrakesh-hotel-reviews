Red Hotel Marrakech,Margery P wrote a review Mar 22,40,First taste of Morocco.,Well situated Hotel in centre of Marrakesh however it is opposite a busy junction train station so very noisy despite double glazing. Traffic noise and surrounded by lots of building works.  Sadly pool out of commission whilst we were there.  Staff friendly and helpful.  Buffet breakfast for dinner also very good and best for quality and variety.compliments to kitchen staff who supporting me as Coeliac. Thank you all.  If given a room at front ask for middle or quieter room.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Southampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/margeryp2014

Red Hotel Marrakech,Mapfay wrote a review Jan 2023,40,New year short stay 22/23,Background: stayed 3 nights over new year 22/23 with the family. Hotel is twinned with The Opera Plaza Hotel but we stayed in the Red Hotel Section.    The Good: friendly staff clean rooms good service and housekeeping wonderful buffet breakfast with scrambled eggs Morocco‚Äôs style pancakes and bread made on demand pool area is fabulous and you could easily spend hours there. Location was good with most tourist attractions a 5 to 10 min cab ride away. The venue has a bowling alley and a restaurant with international football shown every day it is not rowdy and is a nice atmosphere to watch a match. Close to Menara Mall and some western fast food places.    The not so good: the red hotel is a bit dated carpets in common areas are a bit frayed and the room stayed in was very basic with uncomfortable pillows and facing the street was noisy.    Overall: this is an upper 3 star / lower 4 star hotel. I would rate 7 out of 10. I think most people would be happy with a short stay at this hotel for a reasonable price. I have read some of the other reviews on trip advisor which can put you off but our experience was fine. I also note the comment about a new year event on another review we were at the hotel at the same time (the red hotel part) but not invited to anything.,Date of stay: December 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Devon, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mapfay
Red Hotel Marrakech,fionay253 wrote a review Dec 2022,30,New Years Eve 2022/2023,So sad to send this review as everything so far in our stay has been wonderful. We‚Äôve been here 3 nights so far and have really enjoyed our stay. BUT on our first night I was asked to go to reception? I was then asked if we had any plans for New Years Eve? I said no we didn‚Äôt at that time The hotel manager asked if we would like to join their celebration which I thought was a wonderful invite So we didn‚Äôt plan any further they said they would let us know final arrangements on Friday I asked on Friday and today and was told they were still planning? To cut a long story short we were never informed of the plans and had obviously missed any opportunity to book anywhere else so at 8pm we turned up only to be treated like second class citizens. I said we would come back at 9pm and was told that would be good. So at 9pm we did and if was worse we were ignored so we left then a ‚Äúhead waiter‚Äù ran after us saying to come back we did as he knew my name and room number then we suffered the humiliation of him and the short dark haired woman who appeared to be in charge arguing over letting us in!!! So we left for a second time to return to our room NOT the New Years Eve we thought we‚Äôd experience in Marrakesh üò¢. So I guess my message to anyone staying here for New Year is if you are staying the the sister hotel Opera Plaza you are Royalty if however you are staying in the Red Hotel you really are second class citizens and any invite should be avoided. We‚Äôve only got 5 more days here let‚Äôs see if anyone actually apologises for ruining our New Years Eve??,Date of stay: December 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Ulverston, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fionay253
Red Hotel Marrakech,1983TravelLover wrote a review Nov 2022,50,"Nice hotel, well located!",Spotlessly clean hotel about 5 minutes from the airport and 10 minutes from the Medina. Check-in is at the sister hotel Opera Plaza. At times it was a bit slow to get things such as an iron however since the pandemic I believe the hospitality industry has struggled to get staff worldwide so put it down to them being stretched. Breakfast is nice and has a great continental selection of breads pastries cheese salad and juices. I'd recommend going for breakfast by 8.45 if you can to avoid queuing for anything. Would definitely stay here again.,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1983TravelLover

Red Hotel Marrakech,Iffaht F wrote a review Oct 2022,10,Awful experience felt disrespected!!!,AVOID THIS HOTEL!!  Me and my husband stayed at this hotel for 6 days. It was all ok when we checked in but leaving the hotel when we was checking out the receptionist started to be rude to my husband and I. Saying we did not clear the hotel charges when we did two days before and had a receipt to prove we had paid it all. He was shouting at me being abusive verbally pointing fingers at us saying we‚Äôre Pakistani. He was a total arrogant and rude guy who had no respect. Then made it clear we couldn‚Äôt leave the hotel unless we paid 66 Dihrams and called two security men on us. When asked what that charge was for he didn‚Äôt know which was very unusual for him to not know. The excuse he said was his system was down when I asked to check CCTV he said that was out of order how convenient. He was about to attack me from his side of the desk as he was coming in my face. This is a total fraud hotel dodgy receptionists working there who can‚Äôt speak English or even understand it. They only want to make money out of you it‚Äôs a standard hotel not even as clean as it should be. I was in so much distress as I was pregnant and very upset I am attaching a video please watch it don‚Äôt stay at this hotel you will only get disrespected by them they don‚Äôt care how they treat customers. They have no manners or any customer service skills with how to talk. This hotel should close down due to lack of knowledge have no clue how to value there customers. We pay to stay there and in return want respect from the hotel staff which we didn‚Äôt. I hope this receptionist named MONSIF gets sacked he doesn‚Äôt deserve to be working there illiterate man who can‚Äôt talk to women with respect. I will keep making this viral the way I got treated by him and the hotel so no one gets treated how we did. Please watch the video he ruined my first time experience in Morocco thanks to him I won‚Äôt be going back there I‚Äôm scared might get treated like that else where too. I wouldn‚Äôt even give this hotel a rating because of MONSIF!! Didn‚Äôt even get an apology from him at the end he said we don‚Äôt need to pay anything and we can go all that rubbish don‚Äôt understand what the need was for that‚Ä¶,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iffahtf2022

Red Hotel Marrakech,J G wrote a review Sep 2022,30,Better options available,Bit strange this hotel as the Red hotel is now part of the opera plaza hotel whose grounds/common areas are lovely nice food and good breakfast however the rooms are still in the Red hotel which are not ideal.

Red Hotel Marrakech,Man-from-CFL wrote a review Aug 2022,30,Budget hotel opposite the railway station,Stayed for two nights whilst in Marrakech for business; the Red Hotel is in the same building (and owner) as the Opera Plaza Hotel and shares the same excellent pool reception and other facilities. The room was compact but pleasantly decorated with a good shower comfortable bed effective air-con and useable WIFI. The room had a small balcony with views of the train station across the road (The Red Hotel rooms seem to have road views and the Opera Plaza Hotel pool views). A little noise from the road but the window did a good job of blocking most of the noise.    Breakfast was served inside and had less choice than the Plaza but was OK. Most of the hotels restaurants seemed closed post-Covid but the pool / bar restaurant was open and provided good light meals (pizza pasta etc.). It is worth mentioning that if you stay at the Red you need to pay for food and drinks in cash (if you stay in the Opera Plaza you can put this on your room and pay by card when you checkout). Overall a pleasant hotel but given the Opera Plaza is only a little more expensive it might prove better value unless you‚Äôre on a tight budget.,Date of stay: February 2022,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Man-from-CFL
Red Hotel Marrakech,Kris wrote a review May 2022,10,Worst hotel experience I've ever had,I've never left a review on anything before but I have to warn people about this hotel. We had booked through loveholidays but when we arrived to the hotel at around 10pm they told us the booking had been cancelled by the supplier. We had recieved no email stating such and had already prepaid the full amount so we told them it must have been a mistake. Obviously this has nothing to do with the hotel and we got on to the supplier straight away but the staff couldn't have cared less and were quite rude. They did however say they would book us in and hopefully we would get it sorted tomorrow. We spent the whole next day on the phone with loveholidays trying to get the situation sorted. This was quite stressful but anytime we spoke to the hotel staff about the situation there was no offer of help or understanding to be honest it was the opposite as they at wouldn't even let us use the hotel phone to contact the emergency helpline. They made us feel horribly uncomfortable and acted like this was our fault. Eventually loveholidays got through to the supplier and they tried to fix the mistake by honouring the original package with the hotel but the hotel refused. This left loveholidays moving us to another hotel. Red hotel then told us they were going to call the police if we didn't pay 250 euro for the day and a half we stayed there. I've worked in customer service my whole life and I've never been treated so terribly not only in a hotel but any service. I understand this fault wasn't initially the hotels but the way they acted and treated us was appalling. The hotel itself is ok with a nice pool area. Quite pricey for the region but overall nice. Shame its run by staff who have no people skills and seem to enjoy looking down on people.,Date of stay: May 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kkrism
Red Hotel Marrakech,AnnieBateman wrote a review Apr 2022,40,Very good value in a convenient location for us.,Good value hotel located opposite the railway station and 5 minutes walk to Supratours bus station.  The reception pool and restaurant areas are shared with the Opera Plaza hotel.  We chose Red Hotel as a convenient one night stop off before our coach journey onwards.  Our room was clean and spacious with a balcony overlooking the main road and train station. If you‚Äôre into people watching or watching the world go by then that‚Äôs a bonus. If you‚Äôre after peace and quiet then make sure your get a room facing the pool.  The staff were polite and helpful.  Breakfast was buffet style with lots of choice taken outside by the pool or indoors.  Check in and out was efficient and quick.  Lots of restaurants and fast food outlets nearby. If you‚Äôre staying longer there are plentiful taxis by the station which can take you to the medina & other places of interest.  All in all it was perfect for our needs as we were able to pop over to the bus station to buy our tickets the day before travel and then no rush to get there in the morning.  We will definitely stay again when flying into Marrakech and travelling onwards to other destinations.,Date of stay: March 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnieBateman

Red Hotel Marrakech,Ayy wrote a review Aug 2021,10,AVOID! MONEY STOLEN FROM ROOM!!,It's a shame because I would have probably given this hotel a 3-star rating had it not been for my experience in the final two days of my stay.    Pros: Pool area is nice although very busy good location and the pool bar is nice.    Cons: Damp smell coming from the room rooms are basic and not in great condition showers aren't maintained well pillows aren't great quality. I can personally live with these but it's important to some. There was no safe in the room (more on this later) but there was a fridge. No EU plug sockets so take an adapter if needed.    STOLEN MONEY:  This seems like an activity where the security and reception staff both work together. I got locked out of my room at 1am and I went down to request a new card the security guard seemed overly interested in my issue and what my room number was I figured he wanted to help he took the info and disappeared for a while (when he could have just registered a new card at the desk). I had my suspicion that someone had been in my room as the corridor light was on when I went back up and no one else was around at that time. Nothing seemed missing in my room (but my money was hidden) so I ignored it.    I went down again the night before leaving to inquire about my PCR test for which I hadn't received a result for two days (will mention this later). I was made to wait at reception and again the security guard disappeared while the receptionist kept me waiting at the desk. I went back up and my room card didn't work. I went back down and the receptionist handed me a different card straight away which meant it was already registered before I got there rending my one inactive. I went back in the room and the money (¬£GBP) I had JUST been counting before leaving my room had some notes missing. It is no coincidence. This was denied by the staff obviously but what else could I have done? I would have investigated this completely but it was 2am and I had a flight in the morning so I just didn't have the time. Which works perfectly for them. I have since contacted the hotel twice to investigate but I have not received a response so I have tried my best before writing this review.    PCR:  If you still want to stay at this hotel be aware that their process for PCR tests is questionable if you choose to use their doctor (he charges 700Dhs). I took my test 2.5days before my flight and I had to chase reception all day on the day prior to flying out for a result so I could plan accordingly but only got a result at 4am (6 hours before my flight). I believe they do this so if people need to extend their stay they don't have time to plan for another cheaper hotel and forced to rebook with them and use their doctor again. This was further confirmed by another guest who I spoke to before I left who went through the same thing as me except he had a positive COVID test result only a few hours before his flight. He cancelled his flight and extended. But he took another COVID test the same day independently and it was negative. I would stay WELL CLEAR of this hotel in future. It can totally ruin your holiday.,Date of stay: August 2021,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ads910
Red Hotel Marrakech,mchatouani wrote a review Jul 2021,10,"Avoid, Avoid, Avoid",If you are a family with Children and a car...avoidavoidavoid  Bowling and a night club on the ground floor gets very noisy in the evening. Car park gets filled with bowling and night club attendants who sometimes drives their cars in a dangerous way inside the car park. the car park warden informed us ( in quite offensive language) on many occasions that we cannot park our car despite being residents in the Hotel.  Front office staff and management are not qualified often engage with customers in unprofessional manner things like go to your room we will let you knowthen they never come back to you with an answer to your query.  the hotel is overlooking the busiest streets of marrakech so do expect great deal of noise ( car and motorcycle horns) late at night and early morning!  breakfast is quite poor for 4 stars hotel I have seen much better in similar rating hotels in marrakech.  samll Swimming pool area in comparison to the capacity of the hotel!! : very hard to find chairs and parasol and sometime even a room to swim!  Rooms partially painted in Red! I am not sure if others like red colour! but the first impression I got is that I am in a hotel in Red City Amsterdam!!!  If you are looking to come to marrakech to relax enjoy the sun and have a nice time in the pool with your family..then this hotel is definitely not for you.  If you are on a honeymoon or want to make a nice surprise for your girlfriendyou will end up fighting with drunk youngsters trying to set up any female they see...

Red Hotel Marrakech,Victoria C wrote a review Feb 2020,10,Disappointed,What an absolute nightmare. Arrived at hotel to be told they dont have our booking on the system. We showed our receipt of payment with logi travel and they informed us they stopped dealing with them 2 days before as they have had problems receiving payment from them. We were only there for 4 nights and the first day and night was wasted trying to sort our room out in which the hotel wanted us to pay ¬£90 for the room. After no joy we then had to book another room as it was getting late and we needed somewhere to stay. The Manager from logi travel had to come to the hotel the next day and show proof of reservation and payment and sort this out for us. (More of our trip wasted) They then let us stay in the hotel the other 3 nights and we were told we would be refunded for the night we had paid extra for. After numerous of emails we are still waiting for a refund and it's coming up to 2 months now. Putting that bad experience a side the hotel was in a good location the pool was nice but customer service was 1 out of 10 rooms were basic and gym which we wanted to use was tiny.

Red Hotel Marrakech,Nikki B wrote a review Jan 2020,20,I wouldn't stay here again...,I stayed here for 5 nights in December the hotel looked nice online & had good facilities etc. however on arrival the receptionist was rude and very short with me. I asked if we could have a room facing or above the pool because I'd heard those rooms were nicer and much quieter. I had emailed the hotel on 3 occasions to ask about this and to inform them of my severe asthma and allergies but had no reply. The receptionist shouted at me without warning that there were no rooms facing/above the pool! I was taken aback by this but we took our key card and went to our room. The room was very basic and extremely dusty and caused my asthma to play up. I really struggled. I was ok outside but on returning to the room each day I continually needed my inhaler. I went to the reception during our stay following a bad asthma attack and asked about being moved. I felt that maybe being on the roadside of the hotel was part of the problem. I was told there were no rooms away from the road and indeed no other rooms at all. I again asked about rooms by the pool as I saw them on Booking.com with immediate availability and was told there were NO ROOMS with a pool view! This was a major problem for me and it massively spoilt the holiday. I could feel dust on my skin in my hair and in my mouth everytime I returned to the room and was wheezy throughout my stay in this hotel. Breakfasts were ok but the food is uncovered. I found the breakfast staff to be pleasant.  Both female receptionists were rude and spent most of their time either on the phone or chatting to the hotel security staff; the only pleasant member of staff was Jawad he was polite friendly and went out of his way to be helpful.

Red Hotel Marrakech,Mark O wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Super value,Found no issues during my stay at the Red Hotel at the end of September my room was spacious as was the bathroom there was a fridge stocked with drinks and some snacks which although not cheap an option for guests if required there is also a safe in the room also. The breakfast offered was good with a wide range of options available I spent a few hours by the pool which also has a bar for refreshments their was also other amenities available at the hotel which I didn‚Äôt use like a gym ten pin bowling spa and a number of restaurants attached to the building so there are lots of options for guests if travelling into the centre of Marrakech the No.5 stops 100 yards from the entrance of the hotel and cost 40 MAD the staff in all departments are very friendly and helpful,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Darwen, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/840marko

Red Hotel Marrakech,Umair M wrote a review Sep 2019,30,You get what you pay for...,This is my second time staying at this hotel I stayed at this hotel last year around September time and I just got back a couple day ago from staying here for 7 nights. The whole atmosphere was ok but some things really did annoy me such as the bathroom door didn‚Äôt lock at all or shut properly at times the shower head was very hard meaning that water used to come out very fast all the time also sometimes there was no hot water. Also the beds and pillows were rock hard compared to how they were last year not sure if they changed their mattresses and pillows but it definitely was not the same. Another issue that I came across was that the pool was always cold even though it was around 35 degrees most of the time I guess the pool was not heated. Furthermore some of the staff members were extremely rude at times and were not helpful at all. Also there was not one iron in the entire hotel that I could use so me and my friends had to steam all of our clothes which was very time consuming and created a lot of mess. But overall if you want to stay somewhere which is close to everything I would recommend this hotel the rooms were clean and there are a lot of areas where you can just sit back and relax. But I won‚Äôt be going back to this hotel again that‚Äôs for sure.,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/164umairm

Red Hotel Marrakech,Teejay wrote a review Aug 2019,50,Great place Great staff,This hotel was really good for a number of reasons but I want to write the review on the staff which includes the security receptionist and bar/restaurant staff one in particular named Anas. He is a great asset to the hotel he is friendly polite and very happy always and he makes visitors to the hotel feel welcomed and almost at home. If i were to return to marrakech I would stay at the hotel where Anas works because he is such a great guy. He deserves a pay rise and some sort of recognition for the work he puts in and how dedicated he is to his work. Thanks for a great time Anas and to all the other great staff that assisted me in any way... 110% greatness,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tjest87

Red Hotel Marrakech,MangoMaldi wrote a review May 2019,10,Unfortunate front desk staff and management!,We reserved a room for three people. When we checked in we were told the room was only for two people. We showed the email confirmation verifying 3 people. We were left waiting then shown to not only one room - but two rooms - that would only accommodate two people. We finally got a room for 3 people and were told the manager would visit us to apologize. We waited 1.5 hours and the manager never showed up so we left the hotel to go to dinner. On our way out we noticed a stack of papers at the reception area (which was unmanned) including our copies of our passports. We waited for 10 minutes for someone to attend to us - nothing. Granted it was Ramadan but it was nearly 8:00 so most employees probably ate by 7:30 pm. When we returned to the hotel at about 10:30 pm and asked to speak to the manager she was incredibly rude unapologetic and downright rude.

Red Hotel Marrakech,Mark A wrote a review Sep 2018,50,Great Hotel,This was our first visit to Marrakech and the Red Hotel was in a good location with plenty of taxis around as well as numerous local busses which we used to get to and from Jemaa el-Fnaa most evenings.    Check in was smooth and we was given a room on the 5th floorroom was clean and the terrace balcony was huge! There are double sliding patio doors and once closed it was very quiet giving how much traffic passes the hotel.    Breakfast was the usual continental with hard boiled eggs and a few other local hot dishes of pulses and various vegetables the staff here cleared tables speedily and very pleasant.    The pool was huge with plenty of room never had a problem getting sun loungers and the pool guys would put up umbrellas if you needed them and always had time to chat.The poolside restaurant served a mix of salads and pizzas all reasonably priced staff here were very pleasant and special mention to Jalaal who gave us some great information about Morocco and it‚Äôs culture as well as Mr Osama the doorman who greeted us with a handshake each time we was leaving and entering the hotel.We had a pleasant stay and will stay at the Red Hitel next time we visit Marrakech,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Birchington, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/416marka

Red Hotel Marrakech,Dream797469 wrote a review Sep 2018,30,Good Location,The location of the hotel is good as you are able to walk to many places such as the Menara mall and there are food stores close by such as McDonald's and KFC.    Other recommended restaurants bars and clubs are not far from the hotel either. The hotel room is nice however my sister and I experienced on two occasions an awful sewage smell. The breakfast is basic and is not something I would recommend.    Some of the hotel staff are nice however we did experience on a rude member of staff who dropped the phone on us when we asked for information about spa activities the hotel does.    I would not recommend you to pay for any tourist attractions through them they are very expensive as there are getting a commission off of what you pay.,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dream797469

Red Hotel Marrakech,Aisling M wrote a review Aug 2018,40,Good accomadation,"Hotel is nice rooms are relatively clean our shower door did drip all over the floor and the air con did cause a damp smell in the room. But we bought a car air freshener and popped it in between the vents which sorted out the smell. The staff around the pool were fantastic helping people with sun loungers and parasols aswel as taking food and drink orders. I did ask reception one evening for a knife and the lady told me to get one ""in the shop"". Other than that lady all other staff were very accomadating and polite.  We also booked a traditional scubbing hamman and massage in the spa which was great. The ladies there were very professional and accomadating. The massage was lovely and we felt very relaxed after the whole experience.  The hotel is about 45min walk to the medina but 5-10mins taxi costing 30dh (about ¬£2.50) taxi drivers will try charge more but we just said no 30 or nothing and seemed to work. Its right beside the train station also and a shop next door which is essentially a newsagents. Super market is in walking distance as well as the shoping centre and resturaunts.  The hotel is attached to the 5* opera plaza but shares the same pool. There is also an italian restaurant which was lovely. And a bowling alley it was busy when we went down with a 2hr wait but seemed very lively for a bowling alley which also had pool tables and foosball tables.",Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/961aislingm
Red Hotel Marrakech,Amy T wrote a review Aug 2018,20,Read If you are from England travelling.,I am a 22 female and I purchased this holiday for my boyfriend as an early Christmas present. Firstly the door man staff was amazing I didn‚Äôt catch names but they was fantastic. Helped with our bags both ways and opened the doors every single time we left or entered the building. Reception was up and down the man on reception who could speak some English was brilliant knew exactly what he was doing. There was a lady on reception who gave us a room that was already taken we was standing in the room surrounded in someone else‚Äôs stuff. If your room was 2312 we was given your room ( don‚Äôt worry we aren‚Äôt thief‚Äôs and headed straight downstairs ) On our way back up the corridor a receptionist was coming to tell us she accidentally provided the wrong room and to come back down. Bare in mind our flight was delayed and we had been awake 30 hours and still carrying our luggage.    After this we changed our room key over different room was given and the room was stunning very clean not a problem.    RIGHT we went to book our excursions and we booked camels and waterfalls. Camels was okay you get a little Morrocan tea for free mid journey and get to dress in morrocan clothes waterfalls (ouzoud) was awful we paid 800 Durham‚Äôs arrived and had to paid 30 Durham‚Äôs each for the tour guide then 20 each for a boat ride which we wasn‚Äôt informed about. You also get told food was free by reception which we had to argue in our defence for. Also wear trainers as there is ALOT of hiking involved that much I almost collapsed on the steps back up as the car journey was 6 hours due to protestors and we had to re route so I had no water.    Also near the water you see sheeps get there heads literally bashed off in food tents which ruined the trip completely for me.    Food in hotel was nice was given same menu two days in a row so lost interest ( it‚Äôs supposed to be a different set menu every day but wasn‚Äôt )    Buffet for breakfast is just bread and croissants with warm orange juice!    I became very very very poorly by day 3 couldn‚Äôt leave the hotel with sickness I don‚Äôt know if this was the food or the temperature making me unwell but I had to find a pharmacy to get meds just so I could leave hotel. BE VERY CAREFUL WITH FOOD.  I am now at home 2 days later still poorly and considering going into hospital.    There was also little ants running along the floor in the toilet    Also we used our room towels next to the pool for three days as wasn‚Äôt told otherwise on the fourth day we had FOUR..people come up to tell us one after the other we wasn‚Äôt allowed them we told them to take them from us but they said no just for next time then another would come up and tell us the same    Best part of my visit was SO lounge about a 25 min drive but amazing    If I was asked would I return my answer would be no as staff friendliness wouldn‚Äôt make it enough for me to return. I did not see a second pool ( it was in the spa so you have to pay spa prices ) and bowling was in the building next door not in the hotel and also one of the bars on the website wasn‚Äôt even in the building.    Unless you was to get ill and have to watch every single thing you eat don‚Äôt go to this hotel go to a bigger firm,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amyt467
Red Hotel Marrakech,Zenaib K wrote a review Jul 2018,10,Don't stay here,We travelled to marakech last year and decided to get a hotel closer to the centre this time.    However that was a mistake the hotel states staff can speak English however on our third night when I was sick because of the smell in my room I was told they had no other rooms they could not reimburse me and they would send an engineer up. He sprayed some scent opened a window and told me they have a shower drain problem. I then had to clean up my own vomit and sleep in the room as I had no other option. When speaking to the staff I had great difficulty as they could not understand English.    The breakfast was disgusting and had flys all over the bread. The only thing we could stomch was the prathay/pancakes the lady made outside even the milk smelt off.    The pool was ok the shesha was average but expensive considering. The food the hotel served was disgusting and over priced none cooked and cooked meat were kept in the same plate and then served to People.    Rooms were average looking needs an update. Cleaners would not clean properly and we had to ask for towels. If you want WIFI don't bother it won't work in the bedroom.    Staff were rude at the hotel they allowed some people to bring in food from outside and told others off. The mini fridge is a joke and when paying they treat you like a criminal.    We were not told we had to check out at 12 upon our return they charged us 300 dhirams (¬£25).    If you're British and want a decent hotel don't stay here it's a joke. Plenty of nice hotels around the area. I would never stay again.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zenaibk2018

The security staff especially Usama who always made time to speak to us and reception staff were so friendly especially the girls and made our entrance and exit cheerful each time. We checked in so easily and our room was perfect. We had a balcony over looking the train station and beyond- a lovely view! The bathroom was lovely and clean and very spacious. Every day the room was cleaned really well. Lots of people complained about the noise but we had no trouble because there are double doors to the balcony so no problem whatsoever. The hotel location is amazing with buses just a few metres away and taxis constantly outside. Morning breakfast was lovely- very friendly staff and a big variety of food. Again very clean! Wifi was not only in the lobby but in our rooms aswell and was very fast!

Red Hotel Marrakech,sparkleandfluff wrote a review Jun 2018,40,some really good bits,This is a nice clean hotel although the towels looked as though they had seen better days- but they were clean .  The atmosphere is quite sterile but its ok as its a good central base . The pool was fantastic  though I think maybe a few more sunbeds might be useful as they were always in full use ( though admittedly a visit to Marrakesh is probably usually about visiting the mazing sites if this marvellous city )  Our room was great as it over looked the train station  which was noisy but you didn't notice once the windows were closed . Breakfast was good if not a little boring and often ran out of cheese.  It was indicated that all rooms should have a mini bar but we didn't so we asked for one so that we could put our water in it basically . they sorted it within an hour or two which is great . The only problem was that what we didn't realise is that the two packets of crisps and one of nuts( our only purchase from the mini bar) should have been on a tray . The trouble is  you don't know what you do know and when I came to check out it appeared as though somehow the tray( that we never had)  had disappeared . Now I have no idea whether this tray was gold  gold plated or plastic all I can say is that it was very embarrassing and delaying as we were asked about the tray . In order to sign off my bill  they asked if I would sign a piece of paper saying that I hadn't taken anything . I understand that people are just doing their job but I was left a bit shocked at the situation.  I wouldn't let this put anyone off going but can I suggest to the hotel if its going to check what is left in the room  it also needs to check what was there in the first place as guests wouldn't know this and I had I know I was missing a tray I could have asked for one .    It just left a slightly bitter taste especially when the receptionist didn't apologise or even say good bye,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,derby,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sparkleandfluff

Red Hotel Marrakech,Yakz77 wrote a review May 2018,40,4 stars for a 4 star hotel,A pleasant stay - was there for a week with family and was a comfortable stay. Oussama the doorman and receptionist Halima were great and a credit to the hotel. Excellent customer service with a smile. Very helpful. Rooms were cleaned daily very comfortable pool area was clean and hotel in general was spotless.    Stayed on the 5th floor in a double room; very spacious room with a spacious bathroom. Both were immaculate when we got there and were kept so by housekeeping. Beds were good and firm.    Close to aswak al-salam (similar to Asda etc) and lots of little local convenience shops for your daily needs (water snacks etc) and a few mins walk from a nice little cafe Snack Abderahim (try the omelette khlii and also try their avocado with date drink - both are delicious! Also try their grilled chicken with chips and chicken panini. My cousin had their pizza royal which he recommends.    The hotel is opposite the railyway station which has a McDonald's and a KFC - decent value for money. A 35 minute walk to Jama'al-Fana the well known market square. A 10 min walk to shops like Zara and a lovely park.    Breakfast at the hotel was ok if not slightly repetitive - you HAVE TO try the fresh paratha/pancakes that are made daily on the balcony outside the dining room; absolutely amazing! Service of the dining staff was good in general led by Mr. Hamdani a pleasant gentleman who served guests with a smile. The other dining staff were also polite and friendly too. Breakfast service starts at 0630 until 1030 in which time you can eat and drink to your hearts content and make as many vists as you want! Fresh fruit olives cold meats and cheese aswell as boiled eggs and (instant) scrambled eggs make up part of a decent breakfast menu. The danish pastries are also delicious especially the raisin whirl.,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yakz77

Red Hotel Marrakech,Jillian R wrote a review Apr 2018,50,Fantastic Hotel,My daughter and I stayed at this hotel for four nights. The first room we were given did not have a balcony so we asked to change. The receptionist Halima very kindly arranged this the next day. Our next room with the balcony was fabulous as it faced the train station and all the hub of city life in Morocco to enjoy. We did not find it noisy once both sliding doors were closed and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The bathroom was huge. The mattresses were a bit hard but that was not a major problem for us.The rooms were immaculate as were the grounds and pool. We ate at the pool bar which served very tasty food and at the Moroccan restaurant which was lovely. Would definitely recommend both. Especially enjoyed the steak sandwich at the pool bar and three cheese pizza. The staff were really attentive around the pool and at the reception. Both Halima at Reception and the doorman Oussama were excellent and a credit to the hotel. The hotel was central so we could walk to the mall and shuk. We did not have any problems accessing the wifi. We enjoyed the breakfast which was a continental style and the food was nice and the scrambled egg was properly cooked (which is rare to find in hotels) so I was pleasantly surprised. The pastries also were delicious. I would most definitely recommend this hotel as we were very impressed and could not find fault with anything.

Red Hotel Marrakech,Fairypoppins wrote a review Apr 2018,30,Don‚Äôt forget your earplugs,We stayed in a triple room on the 4th floor for 8 nights in April. The balcony faced directly towards the city train station and an extremely busy intersection. Cars honking constantly until after midnight coupled with the loud music from the nightclub downstairs meant we weren‚Äôt able to get any sleep before 1a.m. Other guests were extremely noisy in the early hours and kept us awake but that‚Äôs not the hotels fault. It just added to our lack of sleep. Also there was no air conditioning at this time but we had to keep the window closed due to the noise.  I spoke to the most surly and unhelpful staff at the reception desk on two separate occasions about switching rooms but they seemed uninterested. One made a brief comment about getting a fan but it never materialized.  They also know very little about transport in the area. They only told us about bus number 5 to the main square ( and even suggested it to get to the airport). If you need any local information the doorman is very helpful.  While checking out we were quoted 420MAD for our minibar tab. My husband paid with a credit card and the receipt stated 395MAD with no explanation. I‚Äôm glad he didn‚Äôt pay in cash.  The breakfast is almost the same every day and if the weather is poor the indoor dining room can not accommodate during the last hour. Many times they were not enough glasses or cups for drinks.  The pool area is lovely although we didn‚Äôt get to use it much due to the poor weather. We ordered food from the bar on arrival while waiting for our room to be ready. It wasn‚Äôt impressiveso we didn‚Äôt bother again. There are plenty of nice restaurants within walking distance.  Our room was uninspiring but clean and the beds were comfortable. The cleaning staff were polite and friendly. Perhaps they should swap jobs with the reception staff.

One room had to be changed due to the shower overflowing the new room then had a gas leak.

Red Hotel Marrakech,karl786 wrote a review Mar 2018,30,Uninspiring but functional,This hotel shares its outdoor facilities with the opera plaza hotel (swimming pool car parking outdoor restaurant gym).    The two hotels are part of the same large building but split in two; therefore they both share a very good location - next door to the train station (McDonald‚Äôs kfc etc) - 25 min walk to jamaa el fna 15 min walk to gueliz 10 min walk to minara mall.    The red hotel is definitely a few notches down from opera plaza but does most things quite well (I have stayed in both hotels).    The lobby/entrance is fairly small clean and functional.    With a baby we found the rooms to be slightly on the small side but they are not small per say (all rooms have a balcony).    Be sure to bring your own iron and your own kettle as many hotels don‚Äôt provide either (including this one).    The rooms are clean and of a good 3 Star standard; bathrooms were clean.    Not overly-inspiring but acceptable.    I found the breakfast to be disappointing quite a limited selection of food; there is a chef that cooks pancakes etc but it‚Äôs all a bit low budget including the seating area (outside seating is better however).    Staff were great and can‚Äôt be faulted.    I chose this hotel as opera plaza (which is part of the same building) was approx 30% more expensive; I can see why now.    The rooms at opera plaza are bigger better furnished with better quality fittings and bathrooms. Opera plaza also has a nicer lobby area it‚Äôs own restaurant and a better breakfast area.    On the plus side there is a good young vibe at both hotels so it‚Äôs a good hotel for socialising and meeting people; unlike many hotels in marrakech.    You are able to freely use opera plaza services as well as red hotel services.    In summary i wouldn‚Äôt stay at Red hotel again with my family but I would consider it for a low budget non-family stay.    If you‚Äôre on a budget and care more for location than grandeur then this is a decent compromise.,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karl786

Hotel does not have pool side rooms. (Or so we were told)    Rooms all go onto main road. You basically get little or no sleep due to sleeping next to the M25. Dogs barking and car horns constantly going.    Breakfast was an ok selection and the staff were great to assist with anything you needed. Pancakes lovely and made on the terrace. Only criticism is staff could assist with letting you know the set up.    Pool bar/restaurant lots of staff who were not particularly busy but happy and friendly. Food here was pleasant and not bad values drinks over priced but to be expected.    No pool towels or pool attendant on one of the days and pool was freezing. Reception staff could not assist with getting towels üôÅ    No air con due to it being winter. Even thought it was 24 degrees. In other words hotel being tight    Reception at check out they make you wait so to check your fridge...... even though you tell them what you had. They get someone to check room whilst your waiting to check out. I found this very shocking and as if they trust no one........!!!!    As I said reception staff unhelpful and miserable. One chatting on phone to father  Whilst you standing there. Saying she be leaving at 8. No rush to speak to us. Yes my partner speaks Arabic which is good at times as they always believe you don‚Äôt understand them. Little do they realise.    Sadly we would not return to Marrakech it is not for us.    We saw a mugging outside the hotel. We were followed by men and boys demanding money and walking with you begging.    The souk is poor and lots of pick pockets and shady looking lads watching the tourists. Very uneasy place to be. Plus the souk has nothing of originality selling the same items at each place. Not original evening here was not as others had said. No music or entertainment and food stalls looked grubby and sold the same food. Dreadful place.

We visited as a family of 13 including elderly and young toddlers to teenagers.    The rooms where clean and I cannot fault the service from the staff. Offers Wi-Fi onsite Hammam and massage rooms . And a bowling alley to keep the kids occupied .    Restaurants available on site and its close to other places to dine close to local amendeties local shops restaurant. And good transport links bus taxi  and the train station is opposite with fast food options such as KFC and McDonald's.    Only downside for my room was you can hear the traffic at time but you must ensure the do8ble balcony doors are both closed as that was the issue on the first night . But I suppose theres not alot they can do about that due to its location I supposed a room facing the pool would be a better option .    Only thing I could say for them to improve would probably to invest in some more gym equipment. Maybe some free weights and a bench? .    But all in all a good experience and its merits a 5 star review I couldn't fault the stay.

A cold rainy Marrakech. The hotel was excellent though immaculately clean and with a lovely swimming pool in the centre surrounded by the rooms many with balconies. Far too cold to swim it was 8C most days but cheered up by Thursday and Friday. a pleasant poolside restaurant for snacky-type food although bitterly cold in the evening when the patio heaters were hopelessly trying to keep the open sided restaurant warm. My wife and I were to only residents to use this restaurant all week. We did also eat in the Moroccan Restaurant a few yards away (I think there were at least four restaurants in the hotel which is shared with the Opera Hotel). The manager was Ibrahim ('Brian') who was excellent company and when things were quiet chatted to us about his country. DO NOT catch taxis. We could one twice and each time the cost back to the hotel from the old town was 80 diram (¬£8) and the driver never had change. Excellent single decker buses run from just along the main road from the hotel to the old town and cost just 4 diram. Just pay the driver the 4 and no need to state a destination.The route numbers are 5 10 14 66. By Friday the sun came out and the temperature rose to 18C. We also ate at the Bella Italia upstairs when it was too rainy to walk elsewhere.

Red Hotel Marrakech,ktaz41 wrote a review Feb 2018,40,Good value for money,Service: initially we didn't get off to a good start as we were checked into the wrong rooms however this was promptly sorted and they allowed us to check in early. Osama the door man was by far the most helpful. as we were group of 6 he helped us to find big taxis any time of day and was generally helpful with our questions about Marrakech.    Room: the rooms are reasonably sized and clean. There is a little wear and tear but that didn't bother us considering it was so cheap. Rooms were made up everyday to a good standard and toiletries were refilled. Mini bar is very expensive. There is a supermarket called Aswak salam if you leave the hotel and walk left for 10 minutes.    Breakfast: Breakfast was ok. There was usually something for everyone. The earlier you go the better the breakfast seemed to be. Can get a bit boring after a couple of days. There is a lady making fresh parata/pancakes outside. We didn't get told about this but had read from previous reviews.    Amenities: the pool looked nice but was not warm enough for us to use. We noticed a gym and there is a bowling alley which we didn't used either.    All in all we enjoyed our stay and can't really complain for the price we paid.,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ktaz41

Red Hotel Marrakech,michessex10 wrote a review Jan 2018,30,ok if you can put up with traffic and dog barking all night,I am currently staying at the Red Hotel. It is our 2nd night unfortunately I have to say that it's like staying in a hotel built in the middle of the M25. It's not just the noice of the traffic it's the sound of the car horns all day and all night. Beep Beep clearly they love a horn. Coupled with the Police in the middle of the road directing traffic and blowing their whistles.    I did complain on arrival but was informed by the lady on reception who I must say is very nice that they had no other rooms available and I could change rooms the next day. I have not bothered as we are only here for 4 nights and could not be bothered to pack up again. However 2nd night and I am regretting not taking up the offer.    All the staff at the hotel are very nice. Rooms are basic however good shower. No kettle which I miss. There is a mini bar obviously quite expensive. If you drink alcohol buy whatever you drink at airport and bring with as alcohol is not cheap here as you would expect.    Would I come back definately not but please don't let me put you off it's just not for me.,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sant Vicenc de Montalt, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michessex10

Red Hotel Marrakech,Nicola C wrote a review Mar 2018,30,Misleading photos,Hotel was clean. Some staff (reception) unhelpful. Restaurant staff fantastic door staff great. Pool staff lovely.    Hotel does not have pool side rooms. (Or so we were told)    Rooms all go onto main road. You basically get little or no sleep due to sleeping next to the M25. Dogs barking and car horns constantly going.    Breakfast was an ok selection and the staff were great to assist with anything you needed. Pancakes lovely and made on the terrace. Only criticism is staff could assist with letting you know the set up.    Pool bar/restaurant lots of staff who were not particularly busy but happy and friendly. Food here was pleasant and not bad values drinks over priced but to be expected.    No pool towels or pool attendant on one of the days and pool was freezing. Reception staff could not assist with getting towels üôÅ    No air con due to it being winter. Even thought it was 24 degrees. In other words hotel being tight    Reception at check out they make you wait so to check your fridge...... even though you tell them what you had. They get someone to check room whilst your waiting to check out. I found this very shocking and as if they trust no one........!!!!    As I said reception staff unhelpful and miserable. One chatting on phone to father  Whilst you standing there. Saying she be leaving at 8. No rush to speak to us. Yes my partner speaks Arabic which is good at times as they always believe you don‚Äôt understand them. Little do they realise.    Sadly we would not return to Marrakech it is not for us.    We saw a mugging outside the hotel. We were followed by men and boys demanding money and walking with you begging.    The souk is poor and lots of pick pockets and shady looking lads watching the tourists. Very uneasy place to be. Plus the souk has nothing of originality selling the same items at each place. Not original evening here was not as others had said. No music or entertainment and food stalls looked grubby and sold the same food. Dreadful place.

Red Hotel Marrakech,srahman812 wrote a review Feb 2018,50,Red Hotel,This hotel offers a clean and safe place to stay . We visited as a family of 13 including elderly and young toddlers to teenagers.    The rooms where clean and I cannot fault the service from the staff. Offers Wi-Fi onsite Hammam and massage rooms . And a bowling alley to keep the kids occupied .    Restaurants available on site and its close to other places to dine close to local amendeties local shops restaurant. And good transport links bus taxi  and the train station is opposite with fast food options such as KFC and McDonald's.    Only downside for my room was you can hear the traffic at time but you must ensure the do8ble balcony doors are both closed as that was the issue on the first night . But I suppose theres not alot they can do about that due to its location I supposed a room facing the pool would be a better option .    Only thing I could say for them to improve would probably to invest in some more gym equipment. Maybe some free weights and a bench? .    But all in all a good experience and its merits a 5 star review I couldn't fault the stay.    I would happily return here if i ever visit Marrakech again .,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/srahman812

A cold rainy Marrakech. The hotel was excellent though immaculately clean and with a lovely swimming pool in the centre surrounded by the rooms many with balconies. Far too cold to swim it was 8C most days but cheered up by Thursday and Friday. a pleasant poolside restaurant for snacky-type food although bitterly cold in the evening when the patio heaters were hopelessly trying to keep the open sided restaurant warm. My wife and I were to only residents to use this restaurant all week. We did also eat in the Moroccan Restaurant a few yards away (I think there were at least four restaurants in the hotel which is shared with the Opera Hotel). The manager was Ibrahim ('Brian') who was excellent company and when things were quiet chatted to us about his country. DO NOT catch taxis. We could one twice and each time the cost back to the hotel from the old town was 80 diram (¬£8) and the driver never had change. Excellent single decker buses run from just along the main road from the hotel to the old town and cost just 4 diram. Just pay the driver the 4 and no need to state a destination.The route numbers are 5 10 14 66. By Friday the sun came out and the temperature rose to 18C. We also ate at the Bella Italia upstairs when it was too rainy to walk elsewhere.

Red Hotel Marrakech,Collette wrote a review Feb 2018,40,Great hotel,Stayed here many times with my husband and each time we see the hotel making progress to improve the experience of the client! Rooms are cleaned well everyday the staff work really hard. It would be good to have more than 4 coat hangers in the wardrobe for 2 people staying 7 days. The breakfast room is hit and miss with staff struggling to clean and replenish tables or noticing there are no plates spoons. Sometimes you feel you are constantly hassling the staff for either cutlery a glass cheese bread as they can‚Äôt keep up at busy times. A little frustrating and maybe they need more staff when the hotel is full at breakfast time as most people where like us waiting around for stuff constantly. I felt sorry for the staff. Everyone is really polite and works hard! We enjoyed our stay again and will return next year!

Red Hotel Marrakech,Collette wrote a review Feb 2018,40,Great hotel,Stayed here many times with my husband and each time we see the hotel making progress to improve the experience of the client! Rooms are cleaned well everyday the staff work really hard. It would be good to have more than 4 coat hangers in the wardrobe for 2 people staying 7 days. The breakfast room is hit and miss with staff struggling to clean and replenish tables or noticing there are no plates spoons. Sometimes you feel you are constantly hassling the staff for either cutlery a glass cheese bread as they can‚Äôt keep up at busy times. A little frustrating and maybe they need more staff when the hotel is full at breakfast time as most people where like us waiting around for stuff constantly. I felt sorry for the staff. Everyone is really polite and works hard! We enjoyed our stay again and will return next year!

Red Hotel Marrakech,ktaz41 wrote a review Feb 2018,40,Good value for money,Service: initially we didn't get off to a good start as we were checked into the wrong rooms however this was promptly sorted and they allowed us to check in early. Osama the door man was by far the most helpful. as we were group of 6 he helped us to find big taxis any time of day and was generally helpful with our questions about Marrakech.    Room: the rooms are reasonably sized and clean. There is a little wear and tear but that didn't bother us considering it was so cheap. Rooms were made up everyday to a good standard and toiletries were refilled. Mini bar is very expensive. There is a supermarket called Aswak salam if you leave the hotel and walk left for 10 minutes.    Breakfast: Breakfast was ok. There was usually something for everyone. The earlier you go the better the breakfast seemed to be. Can get a bit boring after a couple of days. There is a lady making fresh parata/pancakes outside. We didn't get told about this but had read from previous reviews.    Amenities: the pool looked nice but was not warm enough for us to use. We noticed a gym and there is a bowling alley which we didn't used either.

Red Hotel Marrakech,michessex10 wrote a review Jan 2018,30,ok if you can put up with traffic and dog barking all night,I am currently staying at the Red Hotel. It is our 2nd night unfortunately I have to say that it's like staying in a hotel built in the middle of the M25. It's not just the noice of the traffic it's the sound of the car horns all day and all night. Beep Beep clearly they love a horn. Coupled with the Police in the middle of the road directing traffic and blowing their whistles.    I did complain on arrival but was informed by the lady on reception who I must say is very nice that they had no other rooms available and I could change rooms the next day. I have not bothered as we are only here for 4 nights and could not be bothered to pack up again. However 2nd night and I am regretting not taking up the offer.    All the staff at the hotel are very nice. Rooms are basic however good shower. No kettle which I miss. There is a mini bar obviously quite expensive. If you drink alcohol buy whatever you drink at airport and bring with as alcohol is not cheap here as you would expect.    Would I come back definately not but please don't let me put you off it's just not for me.,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sant Vicenc de Montalt, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michessex10

Red Hotel Marrakech,Nicola C wrote a review Mar 2018,30,Misleading photos,Hotel was clean. Some staff (reception) unhelpful. Restaurant staff fantastic door staff great. Pool staff lovely.    Hotel does not have pool side rooms. (Or so we were told)    Rooms all go onto main road. You basically get little or no sleep due to sleeping next to the M25. Dogs barking and car horns constantly going.    Breakfast was an ok selection and the staff were great to assist with anything you needed. Pancakes lovely and made on the terrace. Only criticism is staff could assist with letting you know the set up.    Pool bar/restaurant lots of staff who were not particularly busy but happy and friendly. Food here was pleasant and not bad values drinks over priced but to be expected.    No pool towels or pool attendant on one of the days and pool was freezing. Reception staff could not assist with getting towels üôÅ    No air con due to it being winter. Even thought it was 24 degrees. In other words hotel being tight    Reception at check out they make you wait so to check your fridge...... even though you tell them what you had. They get someone to check room whilst your waiting to check out. I found this very shocking and as if they trust no one........!!!!    As I said reception staff unhelpful and miserable. One chatting on phone to father  Whilst you standing there. Saying she be leaving at 8. No rush to speak to us. Yes my partner speaks Arabic which is good at times as they always believe you don‚Äôt understand them. Little do they realise.    Sadly we would not return to Marrakech it is not for us.    We saw a mugging outside the hotel. We were followed by men and boys demanding money and walking with you begging.    The souk is poor and lots of pick pockets and shady looking lads watching the tourists. Very uneasy place to be. Plus the souk has nothing of originality selling the same items at each place. Not original evening here was not as others had said. No music or entertainment and food stalls looked grubby and sold the same food. Dreadful place.

Red Hotel Marrakech,srahman812 wrote a review Feb 2018,50,Red Hotel,This hotel offers a clean and safe place to stay . We visited as a family of 13 including elderly and young toddlers to teenagers.    The rooms where clean and I cannot fault the service from the staff. Offers Wi-Fi onsite Hammam and massage rooms . And a bowling alley to keep the kids occupied .    Restaurants available on site and its close to other places to dine close to local amendeties local shops restaurant. And good transport links bus taxi  and the train station is opposite with fast food options such as KFC and McDonald's.    Only downside for my room was you can hear the traffic at time but you must ensure the do8ble balcony doors are both closed as that was the issue on the first night . But I suppose theres not alot they can do about that due to its location I supposed a room facing the pool would be a better option .    Only thing I could say for them to improve would probably to invest in some more gym equipment. Maybe some free weights and a bench? .    But all in all a good experience and its merits a 5 star review I couldn't fault the stay.

Red Hotel Marrakech,PaulNa wrote a review Feb 2018,50,"Super hotel, super staff but unexpectedly cold wet weather.",A week in Marrakech in early February to get away from a cold drab UK but what happened? A cold rainy Marrakech. The hotel was excellent though immaculately clean and with a lovely swimming pool in the centre surrounded by the rooms many with balconies. Far too cold to swim it was 8C most days but cheered up by Thursday and Friday. a pleasant poolside restaurant for snacky-type food although bitterly cold in the evening when the patio heaters were hopelessly trying to keep the open sided restaurant warm. My wife and I were to only residents to use this restaurant all week. We did also eat in the Moroccan Restaurant a few yards away (I think there were at least four restaurants in the hotel which is shared with the Opera Hotel). The manager was Ibrahim ('Brian') who was excellent company and when things were quiet chatted to us about his country. DO NOT catch taxis. We could one twice and each time the cost back to the hotel from the old town was 80 diram (¬£8) and the driver never had change. Excellent single decker buses run from just along the main road from the hotel to the old town and cost just 4 diram. Just pay the driver the 4 and no need to state a destination.The route numbers are 5 10 14 66. By Friday the sun came out and the temperature rose to 18C. We also ate at the Bella Italia upstairs when it was too rainy to walk elsewhere.

Far too cold to swim it was 8C most days but cheered up by Thursday and Friday. a pleasant poolside restaurant for snacky-type food although bitterly cold in the evening when the patio heaters were hopelessly trying to keep the open sided restaurant warm. My wife and I were to only residents to use this restaurant all week. We did also eat in the Moroccan Restaurant a few yards away (I think there were at least four restaurants in the hotel which is shared with the Opera Hotel). The manager was Ibrahim ('Brian') who was excellent company and when things were quiet chatted to us about his country. DO NOT catch taxis. We could one twice and each time the cost back to the hotel from the old town was 80 diram (¬£8) and the driver never had change. Excellent single decker buses run from just along the main road from the hotel to the old town and cost just 4 diram. Just pay the driver the 4 and no need to state a destination.The route numbers are 5 10 14 66. By Friday the sun came out and the temperature rose to 18C. We also ate at the Bella Italia upstairs when it was too rainy to walk elsewhere.

Red Hotel Marrakech,Collette wrote a review Feb 2018,40,Great hotel,Stayed here many times with my husband and each time we see the hotel making progress to improve the experience of the client! Rooms are cleaned well everyday the staff work really hard. It would be good to have more than 4 coat hangers in the wardrobe for 2 people staying 7 days. The breakfast room is hit and miss with staff struggling to clean and replenish tables or noticing there are no plates spoons. Sometimes you feel you are constantly hassling the staff for either cutlery a glass cheese bread as they can‚Äôt keep up at busy times. A little frustrating and maybe they need more staff when the hotel is full at breakfast time as most people where like us waiting around for stuff constantly. I felt sorry for the staff. Everyone is really polite and works hard! We enjoyed our stay again and will return next year!

Osama the door man was by far the most helpful. as we were group of 6 he helped us to find big taxis any time of day and was generally helpful with our questions about Marrakech.    Room: the rooms are reasonably sized and clean. There is a little wear and tear but that didn't bother us considering it was so cheap. Rooms were made up everyday to a good standard and toiletries were refilled. Mini bar is very expensive. There is a supermarket called Aswak salam if you leave the hotel and walk left for 10 minutes.    Breakfast: Breakfast was ok. There was usually something for everyone. The earlier you go the better the breakfast seemed to be. Can get a bit boring after a couple of days. There is a lady making fresh parata/pancakes outside. We didn't get told about this but had read from previous reviews.    Amenities: the pool looked nice but was not warm enough for us to use. We noticed a gym and there is a bowling alley which we didn't used either.

Red Hotel Marrakech,michessex10 wrote a review Jan 2018,30,ok if you can put up with traffic and dog barking all night,I am currently staying at the Red Hotel. It is our 2nd night unfortunately I have to say that it's like staying in a hotel built in the middle of the M25. It's not just the noice of the traffic it's the sound of the car horns all day and all night. Beep Beep clearly they love a horn. Coupled with the Police in the middle of the road directing traffic and blowing their whistles.    I did complain on arrival but was informed by the lady on reception who I must say is very nice that they had no other rooms available and I could change rooms the next day. I have not bothered as we are only here for 4 nights and could not be bothered to pack up again. However 2nd night and I am regretting not taking up the offer.    All the staff at the hotel are very nice. Rooms are basic however good shower. No kettle which I miss. There is a mini bar obviously quite expensive. If you drink alcohol buy whatever you drink at airport and bring with as alcohol is not cheap here as you would expect.    Would I come back definately not but please don't let me put you off it's just not for me.,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sant Vicenc de Montalt, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michessex10

Hotel does not have pool side rooms. (Or so we were told)    Rooms all go onto main road. You basically get little or no sleep due to sleeping next to the M25. Dogs barking and car horns constantly going.    Breakfast was an ok selection and the staff were great to assist with anything you needed. Pancakes lovely and made on the terrace. Only criticism is staff could assist with letting you know the set up.    Pool bar/restaurant lots of staff who were not particularly busy but happy and friendly. Food here was pleasant and not bad values drinks over priced but to be expected.    No pool towels or pool attendant on one of the days and pool was freezing. Reception staff could not assist with getting towels üôÅ    No air con due to it being winter. Even thought it was 24 degrees. In other words hotel being tight    Reception at check out they make you wait so to check your fridge...... even though you tell them what you had. They get someone to check room whilst your waiting to check out. I found this very shocking and as if they trust no one........!!!!    As I said reception staff unhelpful and miserable. One chatting on phone to father  Whilst you standing there. Saying she be leaving at 8. No rush to speak to us. Yes my partner speaks Arabic which is good at times as they always believe you don‚Äôt understand them. Little do they realise.    Sadly we would not return to Marrakech it is not for us.    We saw a mugging outside the hotel. We were followed by men and boys demanding money and walking with you begging.    The souk is poor and lots of pick pockets and shady looking lads watching the tourists. Very uneasy place to be. Plus the souk has nothing of originality selling the same items at each place. Not original evening here was not as others had said. No music or entertainment and food stalls looked grubby and sold the same food. Dreadful place.

Red Hotel Marrakech,srahman812 wrote a review Feb 2018,50,Red Hotel,This hotel offers a clean and safe place to stay . We visited as a family of 13 including elderly and young toddlers to teenagers.    The rooms where clean and I cannot fault the service from the staff. Offers Wi-Fi onsite Hammam and massage rooms . And a bowling alley to keep the kids occupied .    Restaurants available on site and its close to other places to dine close to local amendeties local shops restaurant. And good transport links bus taxi  and the train station is opposite with fast food options such as KFC and McDonald's.    Only downside for my room was you can hear the traffic at time but you must ensure the do8ble balcony doors are both closed as that was the issue on the first night . But I suppose theres not alot they can do about that due to its location I supposed a room facing the pool would be a better option .    Only thing I could say for them to improve would probably to invest in some more gym equipment. Maybe some free weights and a bench? .    But all in all a good experience and its merits a 5 star review I couldn't fault the stay.    I would happily return here if i ever visit Marrakech again .,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/srahman812

Red Hotel Marrakech,srahman812 wrote a review Feb 2018,50,Red Hotel,This hotel offers a clean and safe place to stay . We visited as a family of 13 including elderly and young toddlers to teenagers.    The rooms where clean and I cannot fault the service from the staff. Offers Wi-Fi onsite Hammam and massage rooms . And a bowling alley to keep the kids occupied .    Restaurants available on site and its close to other places to dine close to local amendeties local shops restaurant. And good transport links bus taxi  and the train station is opposite with fast food options such as KFC and McDonald's.    Only downside for my room was you can hear the traffic at time but you must ensure the do8ble balcony doors are both closed as that was the issue on the first night . But I suppose theres not alot they can do about that due to its location I supposed a room facing the pool would be a better option .    Only thing I could say for them to improve would probably to invest in some more gym equipment. Maybe some free weights and a bench? .    But all in all a good experience and its merits a 5 star review I couldn't fault the stay.    I would happily return here if i ever visit Marrakech again .,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/srahman812
Red Hotel Marrakech,PaulNa wrote a review Feb 2018,50,"Super hotel, super staff but unexpectedly cold wet weather.",A week in Marrakech in early February to get away from a cold drab UK but what happened? A cold rainy Marrakech. The hotel was excellent though immaculately clean and with a lovely swimming pool in the centre surrounded by the rooms many with balconies. Far too cold to swim it was 8C most days but cheered up by Thursday and Friday. a pleasant poolside restaurant for snacky-type food although bitterly cold in the evening when the patio heaters were hopelessly trying to keep the open sided restaurant warm. My wife and I were to only residents to use this restaurant all week. We did also eat in the Moroccan Restaurant a few yards away (I think there were at least four restaurants in the hotel which is shared with the Opera Hotel). The manager was Ibrahim ('Brian') who was excellent company and when things were quiet chatted to us about his country. DO NOT catch taxis. We could one twice and each time the cost back to the hotel from the old town was 80 diram (¬£8) and the driver never had change. Excellent single decker buses run from just along the main road from the hotel to the old town and cost just 4 diram. Just pay the driver the 4 and no need to state a destination.The route numbers are 5 10 14 66. By Friday the sun came out and the temperature rose to 18C. We also ate at the Bella Italia upstairs when it was too rainy to walk elsewhere.

Red Hotel Marrakech,Collette wrote a review Feb 2018,40,Great hotel,Stayed here many times with my husband and each time we see the hotel making progress to improve the experience of the client! Rooms are cleaned well everyday the staff work really hard. It would be good to have more than 4 coat hangers in the wardrobe for 2 people staying 7 days. The breakfast room is hit and miss with staff struggling to clean and replenish tables or noticing there are no plates spoons. Sometimes you feel you are constantly hassling the staff for either cutlery a glass cheese bread as they can‚Äôt keep up at busy times. A little frustrating and maybe they need more staff when the hotel is full at breakfast time as most people where like us waiting around for stuff constantly. I felt sorry for the staff. Everyone is really polite and works hard! We enjoyed our stay again and will return next year!

Osama the door man was by far the most helpful. as we were group of 6 he helped us to find big taxis any time of day and was generally helpful with our questions about Marrakech.    Room: the rooms are reasonably sized and clean. There is a little wear and tear but that didn't bother us considering it was so cheap. Rooms were made up everyday to a good standard and toiletries were refilled. Mini bar is very expensive. There is a supermarket called Aswak salam if you leave the hotel and walk left for 10 minutes.    Breakfast: Breakfast was ok. There was usually something for everyone. The earlier you go the better the breakfast seemed to be. Can get a bit boring after a couple of days. There is a lady making fresh parata/pancakes outside. We didn't get told about this but had read from previous reviews.    Amenities: the pool looked nice but was not warm enough for us to use. We noticed a gym and there is a bowling alley which we didn't used either.

It is our 2nd night unfortunately I have to say that it's like staying in a hotel built in the middle of the M25. It's not just the noice of the traffic it's the sound of the car horns all day and all night. Beep Beep clearly they love a horn. Coupled with the Police in the middle of the road directing traffic and blowing their whistles.    I did complain on arrival but was informed by the lady on reception who I must say is very nice that they had no other rooms available and I could change rooms the next day. I have not bothered as we are only here for 4 nights and could not be bothered to pack up again. However 2nd night and I am regretting not taking up the offer.    All the staff at the hotel are very nice. Rooms are basic however good shower. No kettle which I miss. There is a mini bar obviously quite expensive. If you drink alcohol buy whatever you drink at airport and bring with as alcohol is not cheap here as you would expect.    Would I come back definately not but please don't let me put you off it's just not for me.,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sant Vicenc de Montalt, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michessex10

Hotel does not have pool side rooms. (Or so we were told)    Rooms all go onto main road. You basically get little or no sleep due to sleeping next to the M25. Dogs barking and car horns constantly going.    Breakfast was an ok selection and the staff were great to assist with anything you needed. Pancakes lovely and made on the terrace. Only criticism is staff could assist with letting you know the set up.    Pool bar/restaurant lots of staff who were not particularly busy but happy and friendly. Food here was pleasant and not bad values drinks over priced but to be expected.    No pool towels or pool attendant on one of the days and pool was freezing. Reception staff could not assist with getting towels üôÅ    No air con due to it being winter. Even thought it was 24 degrees. In other words hotel being tight    Reception at check out they make you wait so to check your fridge...... even though you tell them what you had. They get someone to check room whilst your waiting to check out. I found this very shocking and as if they trust no one........!!!!    As I said reception staff unhelpful and miserable. One chatting on phone to father  Whilst you standing there. Saying she be leaving at 8. No rush to speak to us. Yes my partner speaks Arabic which is good at times as they always believe you don‚Äôt understand them. Little do they realise.    Sadly we would not return to Marrakech it is not for us.    We saw a mugging outside the hotel. We were followed by men and boys demanding money and walking with you begging.

Hotel does not have pool side rooms. (Or so we were told)    Rooms all go onto main road. You basically get little or no sleep due to sleeping next to the M25. Dogs barking and car horns constantly going.    Breakfast was an ok selection and the staff were great to assist with anything you needed. Pancakes lovely and made on the terrace. Only criticism is staff could assist with letting you know the set up.    Pool bar/restaurant lots of staff who were not particularly busy but happy and friendly. Food here was pleasant and not bad values drinks over priced but to be expected.    No pool towels or pool attendant on one of the days and pool was freezing. Reception staff could not assist with getting towels üôÅ    No air con due to it being winter. Even thought it was 24 degrees. In other words hotel being tight    Reception at check out they make you wait so to check your fridge...... even though you tell them what you had. They get someone to check room whilst your waiting to check out. I found this very shocking and as if they trust no one........!!!!    As I said reception staff unhelpful and miserable. One chatting on phone to father  Whilst you standing there. Saying she be leaving at 8. No rush to speak to us. Yes my partner speaks Arabic which is good at times as they always believe you don‚Äôt understand them. Little do they realise.    Sadly we would not return to Marrakech it is not for us.    We saw a mugging outside the hotel. We were followed by men and boys demanding money and walking with you begging.    The souk is poor and lots of pick pockets and shady looking lads watching the tourists. Very uneasy place to be. Plus the souk has nothing of originality selling the same items at each place. Not original evening here was not as others had said. No music or entertainment and food stalls looked grubby and sold the same food. Dreadful place.

Red Hotel Marrakech,srahman812 wrote a review Feb 2018,50,Red Hotel,This hotel offers a clean and safe place to stay . We visited as a family of 13 including elderly and young toddlers to teenagers.    The rooms where clean and I cannot fault the service from the staff. Offers Wi-Fi onsite Hammam and massage rooms . And a bowling alley to keep the kids occupied .    Restaurants available on site and its close to other places to dine close to local amendeties local shops restaurant. And good transport links bus taxi  and the train station is opposite with fast food options such as KFC and McDonald's.    Only downside for my room was you can hear the traffic at time but you must ensure the do8ble balcony doors are both closed as that was the issue on the first night . But I suppose theres not alot they can do about that due to its location I supposed a room facing the pool would be a better option .    Only thing I could say for them to improve would probably to invest in some more gym equipment. Maybe some free weights and a bench? .    But all in all a good experience and its merits a 5 star review I couldn't fault the stay.    I would happily return here if i ever visit Marrakech again .,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/srahman812
Red Hotel Marrakech,PaulNa wrote a review Feb 2018,50,"Super hotel, super staff but unexpectedly cold wet weather.",A week in Marrakech in early February to get away from a cold drab UK but what happened? A cold rainy Marrakech. The hotel was excellent though immaculately clean and with a lovely swimming pool in the centre surrounded by the rooms many with balconies. Far too cold to swim it was 8C most days but cheered up by Thursday and Friday. a pleasant poolside restaurant for snacky-type food although bitterly cold in the evening when the patio heaters were hopelessly trying to keep the open sided restaurant warm. My wife and I were to only residents to use this restaurant all week. We did also eat in the Moroccan Restaurant a few yards away (I think there were at least four restaurants in the hotel which is shared with the Opera Hotel). The manager was Ibrahim ('Brian') who was excellent company and when things were quiet chatted to us about his country. DO NOT catch taxis. We could one twice and each time the cost back to the hotel from the old town was 80 diram (¬£8) and the driver never had change. Excellent single decker buses run from just along the main road from the hotel to the old town and cost just 4 diram. Just pay the driver the 4 and no need to state a destination.The route numbers are 5 10 14 66. By Friday the sun came out and the temperature rose to 18C. We also ate at the Bella Italia upstairs when it was too rainy to walk elsewhere.

Red Hotel Marrakech,Collette wrote a review Feb 2018,40,Great hotel,Stayed here many times with my husband and each time we see the hotel making progress to improve the experience of the client! Rooms are cleaned well everyday the staff work really hard. It would be good to have more than 4 coat hangers in the wardrobe for 2 people staying 7 days. The breakfast room is hit and miss with staff struggling to clean and replenish tables or noticing there are no plates spoons. Sometimes you feel you are constantly hassling the staff for either cutlery a glass cheese bread as they can‚Äôt keep up at busy times. A little frustrating and maybe they need more staff when the hotel is full at breakfast time as most people where like us waiting around for stuff constantly. I felt sorry for the staff. Everyone is really polite and works hard! We enjoyed our stay again and will return next year!

Osama the door man was by far the most helpful. as we were group of 6 he helped us to find big taxis any time of day and was generally helpful with our questions about Marrakech.    Room: the rooms are reasonably sized and clean. There is a little wear and tear but that didn't bother us considering it was so cheap. Rooms were made up everyday to a good standard and toiletries were refilled. Mini bar is very expensive. There is a supermarket called Aswak salam if you leave the hotel and walk left for 10 minutes.    Breakfast: Breakfast was ok. There was usually something for everyone. The earlier you go the better the breakfast seemed to be. Can get a bit boring after a couple of days. There is a lady making fresh parata/pancakes outside. We didn't get told about this but had read from previous reviews.    Amenities: the pool looked nice but was not warm enough for us to use. We noticed a gym and there is a bowling alley which we didn't used either.

Red Hotel Marrakech,michessex10 wrote a review Jan 2018,30,ok if you can put up with traffic and dog barking all night,I am currently staying at the Red Hotel. It is our 2nd night unfortunately I have to say that it's like staying in a hotel built in the middle of the M25. It's not just the noice of the traffic it's the sound of the car horns all day and all night. Beep Beep clearly they love a horn. Coupled with the Police in the middle of the road directing traffic and blowing their whistles.    I did complain on arrival but was informed by the lady on reception who I must say is very nice that they had no other rooms available and I could change rooms the next day. I have not bothered as we are only here for 4 nights and could not be bothered to pack up again. However 2nd night and I am regretting not taking up the offer.    All the staff at the hotel are very nice. Rooms are basic however good shower. No kettle which I miss. There is a mini bar obviously quite expensive. If you drink alcohol buy whatever you drink at airport and bring with as alcohol is not cheap here as you would expect.    Would I come back definately not but please don't let me put you off it's just not for me.,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sant Vicenc de Montalt, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michessex10

All the staff at the hotel are very nice. Rooms are basic however good shower. No kettle which I miss. There is a mini bar obviously quite expensive. If you drink alcohol buy whatever you drink at airport and bring with as alcohol is not cheap here as you would expect.    Would I come back definately not but please don't let me put you off it's just not for me.,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sant Vicenc de Montalt, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michessex10

Red Hotel Marrakech,Nicola C wrote a review Mar 2018,30,Misleading photos,Hotel was clean. Some staff (reception) unhelpful. Restaurant staff fantastic door staff great. Pool staff lovely.    Hotel does not have pool side rooms. (Or so we were told)    Rooms all go onto main road. You basically get little or no sleep due to sleeping next to the M25. Dogs barking and car horns constantly going.    Breakfast was an ok selection and the staff were great to assist with anything you needed. Pancakes lovely and made on the terrace. Only criticism is staff could assist with letting you know the set up.    Pool bar/restaurant lots of staff who were not particularly busy but happy and friendly. Food here was pleasant and not bad values drinks over priced but to be expected.    No pool towels or pool attendant on one of the days and pool was freezing. Reception staff could not assist with getting towels üôÅ    No air con due to it being winter. Even thought it was 24 degrees. In other words hotel being tight    Reception at check out they make you wait so to check your fridge...... even though you tell them what you had. They get someone to check room whilst your waiting to check out. I found this very shocking and as if they trust no one........!!!!    As I said reception staff unhelpful and miserable. One chatting on phone to father  Whilst you standing there. Saying she be leaving at 8. No rush to speak to us. Yes my partner speaks Arabic which is good at times as they always believe you don‚Äôt understand them. Little do they realise.    Sadly we would not return to Marrakech it is not for us.    We saw a mugging outside the hotel. We were followed by men and boys demanding money and walking with you begging.    The souk is poor and lots of pick pockets and shady looking lads watching the tourists. Very uneasy place to be. Plus the souk has nothing of originality selling the same items at each place. Not original evening here was not as others had said. No music or entertainment and food stalls looked grubby and sold the same food. Dreadful place.

Red Hotel Marrakech,srahman812 wrote a review Feb 2018,50,Red Hotel,This hotel offers a clean and safe place to stay . We visited as a family of 13 including elderly and young toddlers to teenagers.    The rooms where clean and I cannot fault the service from the staff. Offers Wi-Fi onsite Hammam and massage rooms . And a bowling alley to keep the kids occupied .    Restaurants available on site and its close to other places to dine close to local amendeties local shops restaurant. And good transport links bus taxi  and the train station is opposite with fast food options such as KFC and McDonald's.    Only downside for my room was you can hear the traffic at time but you must ensure the do8ble balcony doors are both closed as that was the issue on the first night . But I suppose theres not alot they can do about that due to its location I supposed a room facing the pool would be a better option .    Only thing I could say for them to improve would probably to invest in some more gym equipment. Maybe some free weights and a bench? .    But all in all a good experience and its merits a 5 star review I couldn't fault the stay.    I would happily return here if i ever visit Marrakech again .,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/srahman812
Red Hotel Marrakech,PaulNa wrote a review Feb 2018,50,"Super hotel, super staff but unexpectedly cold wet weather.",A week in Marrakech in early February to get away from a cold drab UK but what happened? A cold rainy Marrakech. The hotel was excellent though immaculately clean and with a lovely swimming pool in the centre surrounded by the rooms many with balconies. Far too cold to swim it was 8C most days but cheered up by Thursday and Friday. a pleasant poolside restaurant for snacky-type food although bitterly cold in the evening when the patio heaters were hopelessly trying to keep the open sided restaurant warm. My wife and I were to only residents to use this restaurant all week. We did also eat in the Moroccan Restaurant a few yards away (I think there were at least four restaurants in the hotel which is shared with the Opera Hotel). The manager was Ibrahim ('Brian') who was excellent company and when things were quiet chatted to us about his country. DO NOT catch taxis. We could one twice and each time the cost back to the hotel from the old town was 80 diram (¬£8) and the driver never had change. Excellent single decker buses run from just along the main road from the hotel to the old town and cost just 4 diram. Just pay the driver the 4 and no need to state a destination.The route numbers are 5 10 14 66. By Friday the sun came out and the temperature rose to 18C. We also ate at the Bella Italia upstairs when it was too rainy to walk elsewhere.

Red Hotel Marrakech,Collette wrote a review Feb 2018,40,Great hotel,Stayed here many times with my husband and each time we see the hotel making progress to improve the experience of the client! Rooms are cleaned well everyday the staff work really hard. It would be good to have more than 4 coat hangers in the wardrobe for 2 people staying 7 days. The breakfast room is hit and miss with staff struggling to clean and replenish tables or noticing there are no plates spoons. Sometimes you feel you are constantly hassling the staff for either cutlery a glass cheese bread as they can‚Äôt keep up at busy times. A little frustrating and maybe they need more staff when the hotel is full at breakfast time as most people where like us waiting around for stuff constantly. I felt sorry for the staff.

Room: the rooms are reasonably sized and clean. There is a little wear and tear but that didn't bother us considering it was so cheap.

The earlier you go the better the breakfast seemed to be. Can get a bit boring after a couple of days. There is a lady making fresh parata/pancakes outside. We didn't get told about this but had read from previous reviews.    Amenities: the pool looked nice but was not warm enough for us to use.

We didn't get told about this but had read from previous reviews.    Amenities: the pool looked nice but was not warm enough for us to use. We noticed a gym and there is a bowling alley which we didn't used either.    All in all we enjoyed our stay and can't really complain for the price we paid.,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ktaz41

Red Hotel Marrakech,michessex10 wrote a review Jan 2018,30,ok if you can put up with traffic and dog barking all night,I am currently staying at the Red Hotel. It is our 2nd night unfortunately I have to say that it's like staying in a hotel built in the middle of the M25. It's not just the noice of the traffic it's the sound of the car horns all day and all night. Beep Beep clearly they love a horn. Coupled with the Police in the middle of the road directing traffic and blowing their whistles.    I did complain on arrival but was informed by the lady on reception who I must say is very nice that they had no other rooms available and I could change rooms the next day. I have not bothered as we are only here for 4 nights and could not be bothered to pack up again. However 2nd night and I am regretting not taking up the offer.    All the staff at the hotel are very nice. Rooms are basic however good shower. No kettle which I miss. There is a mini bar obviously quite expensive. If you drink alcohol buy whatever you drink at airport and bring with as alcohol is not cheap here as you would expect.    Would I come back definately not but please don't let me put you off it's just not for me.,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sant Vicenc de Montalt, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michessex10

Red Hotel Marrakech,Nicola C wrote a review Mar 2018,30,Misleading photos,Hotel was clean. Some staff (reception) unhelpful. Restaurant staff fantastic door staff great. Pool staff lovely.    Hotel does not have pool side rooms. (Or so we were told)    Rooms all go onto main road. You basically get little or no sleep due to sleeping next to the M25. Dogs barking and car horns constantly going.    Breakfast was an ok selection and the staff were great to assist with anything you needed. Pancakes lovely and made on the terrace. Only criticism is staff could assist with letting you know the set up.    Pool bar/restaurant lots of staff who were not particularly busy but happy and friendly. Food here was pleasant and not bad values drinks over priced but to be expected.    No pool towels or pool attendant on one of the days and pool was freezing. Reception staff could not assist with getting towels üôÅ    No air con due to it being winter. Even thought it was 24 degrees. In other words hotel being tight    Reception at check out they make you wait so to check your fridge...... even though you tell them what you had. They get someone to check room whilst your waiting to check out. I found this very shocking and as if they trust no one........!!!!    As I said reception staff unhelpful and miserable. One chatting on phone to father  Whilst you standing there. Saying she be leaving at 8. No rush to speak to us. Yes my partner speaks Arabic which is good at times as they always believe you don‚Äôt understand them. Little do they realise.    Sadly we would not return to Marrakech it is not for us.    We saw a mugging outside the hotel. We were followed by men and boys demanding money and walking with you begging.    The souk is poor and lots of pick pockets and shady looking lads watching the tourists. Very uneasy place to be. Plus the souk has nothing of originality selling the same items at each place. Not original evening here was not as others had said. No music or entertainment and food stalls looked grubby and sold the same food. Dreadful place.

Red Hotel Marrakech,srahman812 wrote a review Feb 2018,50,Red Hotel,This hotel offers a clean and safe place to stay . We visited as a family of 13 including elderly and young toddlers to teenagers.    The rooms where clean and I cannot fault the service from the staff. Offers Wi-Fi onsite Hammam and massage rooms . And a bowling alley to keep the kids occupied .    Restaurants available on site and its close to other places to dine close to local amendeties local shops restaurant. And good transport links bus taxi  and the train station is opposite with fast food options such as KFC and McDonald's.    Only downside for my room was you can hear the traffic at time but you must ensure the do8ble balcony doors are both closed as that was the issue on the first night . But I suppose theres not alot they can do about that due to its location I supposed a room facing the pool would be a better option .    Only thing I could say for them to improve would probably to invest in some more gym equipment. Maybe some free weights and a bench? .    But all in all a good experience and its merits a 5 star review I couldn't fault the stay.    I would happily return here if i ever visit Marrakech again .,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/srahman812

A cold rainy Marrakech. The hotel was excellent though immaculately clean and with a lovely swimming pool in the centre surrounded by the rooms many with balconies. Far too cold to swim it was 8C most days but cheered up by Thursday and Friday. a pleasant poolside restaurant for snacky-type food although bitterly cold in the evening when the patio heaters were hopelessly trying to keep the open sided restaurant warm. My wife and I were to only residents to use this restaurant all week. We did also eat in the Moroccan Restaurant a few yards away (I think there were at least four restaurants in the hotel which is shared with the Opera Hotel). The manager was Ibrahim ('Brian') who was excellent company and when things were quiet chatted to us about his country. DO NOT catch taxis. We could one twice and each time the cost back to the hotel from the old town was 80 diram (¬£8) and the driver never had change. Excellent single decker buses run from just along the main road from the hotel to the old town and cost just 4 diram. Just pay the driver the 4 and no need to state a destination.The route numbers are 5 10 14 66. By Friday the sun came out and the temperature rose to 18C. We also ate at the Bella Italia upstairs when it was too rainy to walk elsewhere.

Red Hotel Marrakech,Collette wrote a review Feb 2018,40,Great hotel,Stayed here many times with my husband and each time we see the hotel making progress to improve the experience of the client! Rooms are cleaned well everyday the staff work really hard. It would be good to have more than 4 coat hangers in the wardrobe for 2 people staying 7 days. The breakfast room is hit and miss with staff struggling to clean and replenish tables or noticing there are no plates spoons. Sometimes you feel you are constantly hassling the staff for either cutlery a glass cheese bread as they can‚Äôt keep up at busy times. A little frustrating and maybe they need more staff when the hotel is full at breakfast time as most people where like us waiting around for stuff constantly. I felt sorry for the staff. Everyone is really polite and works hard! We enjoyed our stay again and will return next year!

Red Hotel Marrakech,Collette wrote a review Feb 2018,40,Great hotel,Stayed here many times with my husband and each time we see the hotel making progress to improve the experience of the client! Rooms are cleaned well everyday the staff work really hard. It would be good to have more than 4 coat hangers in the wardrobe for 2 people staying 7 days. The breakfast room is hit and miss with staff struggling to clean and replenish tables or noticing there are no plates spoons. Sometimes you feel you are constantly hassling the staff for either cutlery a glass cheese bread as they can‚Äôt keep up at busy times. A little frustrating and maybe they need more staff when the hotel is full at breakfast time as most people where like us waiting around for stuff constantly. I felt sorry for the staff. Everyone is really polite and works hard! We enjoyed our stay again and will return next year!

Red Hotel Marrakech,ktaz41 wrote a review Feb 2018,40,Good value for money,Service: initially we didn't get off to a good start as we were checked into the wrong rooms however this was promptly sorted and they allowed us to check in early. Osama the door man was by far the most helpful. as we were group of 6 he helped us to find big taxis any time of day and was generally helpful with our questions about Marrakech.    Room: the rooms are reasonably sized and clean. There is a little wear and tear but that didn't bother us considering it was so cheap. Rooms were made up everyday to a good standard and toiletries were refilled. Mini bar is very expensive. There is a supermarket called Aswak salam if you leave the hotel and walk left for 10 minutes.    Breakfast: Breakfast was ok. There was usually something for everyone. The earlier you go the better the breakfast seemed to be. Can get a bit boring after a couple of days. There is a lady making fresh parata/pancakes outside. We didn't get told about this but had read from previous reviews.    Amenities: the pool looked nice but was not warm enough for us to use. We noticed a gym and there is a bowling alley which we didn't used either.

Red Hotel Marrakech,michessex10 wrote a review Jan 2018,30,ok if you can put up with traffic and dog barking all night,I am currently staying at the Red Hotel. It is our 2nd night unfortunately I have to say that it's like staying in a hotel built in the middle of the M25. It's not just the noice of the traffic it's the sound of the car horns all day and all night. Beep Beep clearly they love a horn. Coupled with the Police in the middle of the road directing traffic and blowing their whistles.    I did complain on arrival but was informed by the lady on reception who I must say is very nice that they had no other rooms available and I could change rooms the next day. I have not bothered as we are only here for 4 nights and could not be bothered to pack up again. However 2nd night and I am regretting not taking up the offer.    All the staff at the hotel are very nice. Rooms are basic however good shower. No kettle which I miss. There is a mini bar obviously quite expensive. If you drink alcohol buy whatever you drink at airport and bring with as alcohol is not cheap here as you would expect.    Would I come back definately not but please don't let me put you off it's just not for me.,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sant Vicenc de Montalt, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michessex10

Red Hotel Marrakech,Nicola C wrote a review Mar 2018,30,Misleading photos,Hotel was clean. Some staff (reception) unhelpful. Restaurant staff fantastic door staff great. Pool staff lovely.    Hotel does not have pool side rooms. (Or so we were told)    Rooms all go onto main road. You basically get little or no sleep due to sleeping next to the M25. Dogs barking and car horns constantly going.    Breakfast was an ok selection and the staff were great to assist with anything you needed. Pancakes lovely and made on the terrace. Only criticism is staff could assist with letting you know the set up.    Pool bar/restaurant lots of staff who were not particularly busy but happy and friendly. Food here was pleasant and not bad values drinks over priced but to be expected.    No pool towels or pool attendant on one of the days and pool was freezing. Reception staff could not assist with getting towels üôÅ    No air con due to it being winter. Even thought it was 24 degrees. In other words hotel being tight    Reception at check out they make you wait so to check your fridge...... even though you tell them what you had. They get someone to check room whilst your waiting to check out. I found this very shocking and as if they trust no one........!!!!    As I said reception staff unhelpful and miserable. One chatting on phone to father  Whilst you standing there. Saying she be leaving at 8. No rush to speak to us. Yes my partner speaks Arabic which is good at times as they always believe you don‚Äôt understand them. Little do they realise.    Sadly we would not return to Marrakech it is not for us.    We saw a mugging outside the hotel. We were followed by men and boys demanding money and walking with you begging.    The souk is poor and lots of pick pockets and shady looking lads watching the tourists. Very uneasy place to be. Plus the souk has nothing of originality selling the same items at each place. Not original evening here was not as others had said. No music or entertainment and food stalls looked grubby and sold the same food. Dreadful place.

Red Hotel Marrakech,srahman812 wrote a review Feb 2018,50,Red Hotel,This hotel offers a clean and safe place to stay . We visited as a family of 13 including elderly and young toddlers to teenagers.    The rooms where clean and I cannot fault the service from the staff. Offers Wi-Fi onsite Hammam and massage rooms . And a bowling alley to keep the kids occupied .    Restaurants available on site and its close to other places to dine close to local amendeties local shops restaurant. And good transport links bus taxi  and the train station is opposite with fast food options such as KFC and McDonald's.    Only downside for my room was you can hear the traffic at time but you must ensure the do8ble balcony doors are both closed as that was the issue on the first night . But I suppose theres not alot they can do about that due to its location I supposed a room facing the pool would be a better option .    Only thing I could say for them to improve would probably to invest in some more gym equipment. Maybe some free weights and a bench? .    But all in all a good experience and its merits a 5 star review I couldn't fault the stay.

Red Hotel Marrakech,PaulNa wrote a review Feb 2018,50,"Super hotel, super staff but unexpectedly cold wet weather.",A week in Marrakech in early February to get away from a cold drab UK but what happened? A cold rainy Marrakech. The hotel was excellent though immaculately clean and with a lovely swimming pool in the centre surrounded by the rooms many with balconies. Far too cold to swim it was 8C most days but cheered up by Thursday and Friday. a pleasant poolside restaurant for snacky-type food although bitterly cold in the evening when the patio heaters were hopelessly trying to keep the open sided restaurant warm. My wife and I were to only residents to use this restaurant all week. We did also eat in the Moroccan Restaurant a few yards away (I think there were at least four restaurants in the hotel which is shared with the Opera Hotel). The manager was Ibrahim ('Brian') who was excellent company and when things were quiet chatted to us about his country. DO NOT catch taxis. We could one twice and each time the cost back to the hotel from the old town was 80 diram (¬£8) and the driver never had change. Excellent single decker buses run from just along the main road from the hotel to the old town and cost just 4 diram. Just pay the driver the 4 and no need to state a destination.The route numbers are 5 10 14 66. By Friday the sun came out and the temperature rose to 18C. We also ate at the Bella Italia upstairs when it was too rainy to walk elsewhere.

Far too cold to swim it was 8C most days but cheered up by Thursday and Friday. a pleasant poolside restaurant for snacky-type food although bitterly cold in the evening when the patio heaters were hopelessly trying to keep the open sided restaurant warm. My wife and I were to only residents to use this restaurant all week. We did also eat in the Moroccan Restaurant a few yards away (I think there were at least four restaurants in the hotel which is shared with the Opera Hotel). The manager was Ibrahim ('Brian') who was excellent company and when things were quiet chatted to us about his country. DO NOT catch taxis. We could one twice and each time the cost back to the hotel from the old town was 80 diram (¬£8) and the driver never had change. Excellent single decker buses run from just along the main road from the hotel to the old town and cost just 4 diram. Just pay the driver the 4 and no need to state a destination.The route numbers are 5 10 14 66. By Friday the sun came out and the temperature rose to 18C. We also ate at the Bella Italia upstairs when it was too rainy to walk elsewhere.

Red Hotel Marrakech,Collette wrote a review Feb 2018,40,Great hotel,Stayed here many times with my husband and each time we see the hotel making progress to improve the experience of the client! Rooms are cleaned well everyday the staff work really hard. It would be good to have more than 4 coat hangers in the wardrobe for 2 people staying 7 days. The breakfast room is hit and miss with staff struggling to clean and replenish tables or noticing there are no plates spoons. Sometimes you feel you are constantly hassling the staff for either cutlery a glass cheese bread as they can‚Äôt keep up at busy times. A little frustrating and maybe they need more staff when the hotel is full at breakfast time as most people where like us waiting around for stuff constantly. I felt sorry for the staff. Everyone is really polite and works hard! We enjoyed our stay again and will return next year!

Room: the rooms are reasonably sized and clean. There is a little wear and tear but that didn't bother us considering it was so cheap.

It is our 2nd night unfortunately I have to say that it's like staying in a hotel built in the middle of the M25. It's not just the noice of the traffic it's the sound of the car horns all day and all night. Beep Beep clearly they love a horn. Coupled with the Police in the middle of the road directing traffic and blowing their whistles.    I did complain on arrival but was informed by the lady on reception who I must say is very nice that they had no other rooms available and I could change rooms the next day. I have not bothered as we are only here for 4 nights and could not be bothered to pack up again. However 2nd night and I am regretting not taking up the offer.    All the staff at the hotel are very nice. Rooms are basic however good shower. No kettle which I miss. There is a mini bar obviously quite expensive. If you drink alcohol buy whatever you drink at airport and bring with as alcohol is not cheap here as you would expect.

Red Hotel Marrakech,Nicola C wrote a review Mar 2018,30,Misleading photos,Hotel was clean. Some staff (reception) unhelpful. Restaurant staff fantastic door staff great. Pool staff lovely.    Hotel does not have pool side rooms. (Or so we were told)    Rooms all go onto main road. You basically get little or no sleep due to sleeping next to the M25. Dogs barking and car horns constantly going.    Breakfast was an ok selection and the staff were great to assist with anything you needed. Pancakes lovely and made on the terrace. Only criticism is staff could assist with letting you know the set up.    Pool bar/restaurant lots of staff who were not particularly busy but happy and friendly. Food here was pleasant and not bad values drinks over priced but to be expected.    No pool towels or pool attendant on one of the days and pool was freezing. Reception staff could not assist with getting towels üôÅ    No air con due to it being winter. Even thought it was 24 degrees. In other words hotel being tight    Reception at check out they make you wait so to check your fridge...... even though you tell them what you had. They get someone to check room whilst your waiting to check out. I found this very shocking and as if they trust no one........!!!!    As I said reception staff unhelpful and miserable. One chatting on phone to father  Whilst you standing there. Saying she be leaving at 8. No rush to speak to us. Yes my partner speaks Arabic which is good at times as they always believe you don‚Äôt understand them. Little do they realise.    Sadly we would not return to Marrakech it is not for us.    We saw a mugging outside the hotel. We were followed by men and boys demanding money and walking with you begging.    The souk is poor and lots of pick pockets and shady looking lads watching the tourists. Very uneasy place to be. Plus the souk has nothing of originality selling the same items at each place. Not original evening here was not as others had said. No music or entertainment and food stalls looked grubby and sold the same food. Dreadful place.

Red Hotel Marrakech,srahman812 wrote a review Feb 2018,50,Red Hotel,This hotel offers a clean and safe place to stay . We visited as a family of 13 including elderly and young toddlers to teenagers.    The rooms where clean and I cannot fault the service from the staff. Offers Wi-Fi onsite Hammam and massage rooms . And a bowling alley to keep the kids occupied .    Restaurants available on site and its close to other places to dine close to local amendeties local shops restaurant. And good transport links bus taxi  and the train station is opposite with fast food options such as KFC and McDonald's.    Only downside for my room was you can hear the traffic at time but you must ensure the do8ble balcony doors are both closed as that was the issue on the first night . But I suppose theres not alot they can do about that due to its location I supposed a room facing the pool would be a better option .    Only thing I could say for them to improve would probably to invest in some more gym equipment. Maybe some free weights and a bench? .    But all in all a good experience and its merits a 5 star review I couldn't fault the stay.

Red Hotel Marrakech,Miguel V wrote a review Oct 2013,20,Bad value for money,I booked three nights in this hotel and I¬¥m still regretting. The staff did not let me do the check in because they did not get any confirmation email from my travel agency however I showed the email to them but it was was not enough for the recepcionist and the thing is I¬¥ve already paid for it. Instead of suggesting me a solution or calling the travel agency they asked to to do it because they are not doing any any international call. I had to go at 10 pm to the nearby hotel to spend the night there. I came back next morning because they guaranteed the day before it was going to be all sorted by next day but it wasnt at all and on top of that I had to wait several hours at the lounge for getting some information about what was happening as no one told me anything. I was completely exhasted so I paid again for the next 2 nights and just wanted to enjoy my last 2 days of holidays.  I¬¥ve been pasing by the reception desk many times during those 2 days and I realized some other customers had the same problem that I had so my case was not an isolated one.    There are some good points about the hotel: The rooms are airy it¬¥s close to the train station the pool arear is quite nice and is clean. On the other hand the negative ones are: It¬¥s far from Jamaa el Fna no wifi in the rooms not as good breakfast as other riads/hotels the sun is gone at 15.30 from the swiming pool etc so overall it¬¥s not good value for money at all.    I would not recommend this hotel if you are looking for an authentic Morocco experience.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Gran Canaria, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/578miguela
Red Hotel Marrakech,Maggie H wrote a review Oct 2013,40,Very good value,I paid just over ¬£20 per night for a double room with breakfast which was such good value. My room overlooked the station and it was fascinating to sit on the balcony and watch daily life in Marrakech going by -like a film ! My room was very quiet thanks to the triple glazed doors and very clean. The maids were wonderful. The pool was shared with the Opera Plaza via a connecting door and was a very good sized area compared to other hotels in the vicinity..Breakfast was a buffet -eggscheesecold meatsaladsfruit yoghurt and pastries.It was very nice not to have to queue for things as there were usually only about 20 people in there.  There were plenty of reasonably priced cafes nearby for drinks and other mealsincluding a McDonalds next to the station !

Red Hotel Marrakech,redy2 wrote a review Oct 2013,40,Great budget hotel,Clean modern hotel with everything you could want from a budget hotel. Service was excellent & nothing too much trouble. We were originally on 4th floor very quiet however slightly smelly due to a drainage issue and the room only had 2 single beds. So requested a room change. We ended up on 3rd floor at the front facing the main road & near the disco you may have read about in other reviews. I can honestly say I never heard the disco & yes the road is busy. But remember you are in a city & we enjoyed siting on the balcony watching the mayhem of the way the traffic missed each other. When we retired for the evening the 2 sets of patio doors silenced the outside world. We would absolutely recommend this hotel for a short stay or budget trip if you want 5 star this is not for you.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sittingbourne, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/redy2
Red Hotel Marrakech,Tazbabeslotus wrote a review Oct 2013,40,"Good hotel, nice rooms, good location for train station",The Red Hotel is facing the station station and bus station (Supratours) so great for the traveller. Rooms - form over function ! no drawers 3 coathangers no electric on bedsides rooms cleaned and tidied often. No tea/coffee making (reception admit this is not good) we did not hear any disco or road noise when the 2 sets of doors were closed and just the road noise when open. Room electric uses door credit card in slot to work. The bathroom is modern and clean with large shower cubicle the shower goes very hot and very cold during use. Nice size balcony with plastic chairs and table. Good aircon in room (and does not go off when balcony doors open). Make sure you ask for a train station view there are no pool views as this hotel is in an L shape wrapped round the Opera Plaza hotel - either train station view (you get a balcony) or side road (no balcony and bins/beggars view). Floor 1 is the where the restaurant is. Breakfast good (sliced meat sliced cheese jam bread sweet pastries fresh fruit cereal natural yogurt boiled eggs scrambled eggs tea coffee hot chocolate) need milk jugs for people making tea. Reception friendly mostly spoke good English free wifi in reception area. Pool in adjoining hotel nice (needs cleaning by pool stools) and 20Dh for a small bottle of water and 500 for a 33cl beer is expensive. Go out of the hotel and go left until facing Supratours and wait on the roadside here for a bus to the square (4dH each) get off when you see the horses lined up. Supratours is the place to go to catch a bus to Essaouira (the beach) 70Dh pp each way is a 2 hour each way trip but well worth it,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Rochdale, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tazbabeslotus

Red Hotel Marrakech,Diane C wrote a review Oct 2013,50,Convenient for the train station,We stayed here on our last night in Morocco. We had been 'riding the rail' from Marrakech to Tangier then over to Gibraltar then train from Tangier to Fes and then from Fes back to Marrakech and chose this hotel because it is right across the street from the train station. Although we hadn't been staying there in our first few days the reception person was very helpful with letting us store some of our luggage in their baggage room while we were travelling around the rest of the country before arriving there for our last night. The hotel is modern but decorated in a Moroccan style with the rooms situated around a central open courtyard and they share some restaurants with the Opera hotel group next door. We had traditional Moroccan food (chicken bastilla yummy and lamb tagine) in the poolside caf√© and it was very good. (The chicken bastilla is big enough for two and is chicken with almonds in a filo pastry shell with cinnamon and powdered sugar). The breakfast was very good as well and we booked our room through lastminute.com for about ¬£40 which we thought was good value including the luggage storage for a week. The doorman (who looks a lot like James Bond's Oddjob) was very helpful.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cambridge, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/844dianec

Red Hotel Marrakech,Lutonnil wrote a review Oct 2013,40,Good clean hotel,Have just spent 3 nights here and have found the hotel to be clean and all the staff we have come into contact with are polite and friendly. About a 45 minute walk to the medina or a 50 dhr taxi ride that's about 4 quid. I know the locals pay less but at least forwarned it shouldn't be a suprise. Hotel is right opposite the train station but we didn't hear one train whilst staying here so don't let that put you off. Good hotel in a convenient position. I might consider a hotel nearer the medina if I came here again but then might find it a lot more expensive and maybe not as friendly.,,,Luton,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lutonnil
Red Hotel Marrakech,Aarti K wrote a review Oct 2013,40,A surprising gem!,My mom and a couple of friends stayed in the hotel in the last week of September/first couple of days in October and to be honest reading some of the previous reviews we were not sure what to expect especially since it is a 3* however we were pleasantly surprised :)    The decor feel and atmosphere of the hotel is very welcoming and modern. The staff are very friendly and polite always have a smile and say hello! The room was facing the road and the train station but we had no problems with noise as the balcony had double doors so if we wanted some quiet we would just shut the door. The rooms were comfortable a good size and always cleaned.    Many of the facilitates are shared with the hotel next door (which is a 4*). The hotel boasts that it has a bowling alley spa and club however they are located in the hotel next door. It was great knowing that we had these facilitates and the other hotel was also quite friendly. The pool area is shared so you will most likely see people you do not recognise but it is a lovely little lounge area. I would recommend the hammam it was great and my skin was glowing!    The location of the hotel is great as we were able to go on foot to most places such as the markets. We were close enough to get to the markets to walk however not so close that it had all the hustle and bustle. There are plenty of trendy cafe's and restaurants just a short walk away offering all things continental to traditional.    I would recommend the bus tour that we did over 2 days as there was an inner city and outer city tour. It was great and convenient because it stopped straight outside the hotel.    Also - in term of the food. I had read in a previous review that vegetarian food would be hard to come by however I had no issues as those who do not eat meat or fish are well catered for! The markets in the evenings are a must the smell of all the wonderful food and the entertainment is great!    All in all a great hotel and trip!

Red Hotel Marrakech,chantellew228 wrote a review Sep 2013,20,room smelt like sewage,Also the housekeeping staff don't respect do not disturb signs - and there aren't locks on the doors (at least of the rooms we were in) so I wouldn't stay there again - it's not what you would expect from a three star hotel. Several of the Red Hotel rooms appear to smell like sewage - the whole room as soon as you opened the room from the experience of our group - who had 4 rooms in total - i.e. it wasn't just one room that was a problem. We were able to be moved to different rooms - which smelt ok - when we asked - however obviously that only works if the hotel isn't very full. (The room we put in the shower still smelt bad but only if you opened the door to the shower - so it was manageable). From the reaction of the reception staff I gather this is an ongoing issue - i.e. they weren't surprised and didn't say they'd get someone to look into it - as you might have expected. Either that or they just didn't really care- as their English was perfectly good. However the pool is good and the location is very close to the train station - and it's all quite modern looking- but I wouldn't stay again. Also the reception area of the hotel really reeks of what I assume is a strong floral cleaning product?,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chantellew228
Red Hotel Marrakech,Fiona M wrote a review Sep 2013,40,Good friendly value for money hotel,Good value for money when I booked. Stayed 7 nights. Comments below influenced by traveling solo. My room on 5th floor overlooking train station was smart and well maintained during stay. Double doors to balcony kept it quiet. Breakfast (6.30-10.30) was okay although lacking variety which would have been good after a few days. Can be enjoyed on terrace. Evening meal option upgrade for buffet was excellent value (¬£35/7nights) although not used every night. Poolside shared with Opera Plaza Hotel was very good for service; good range snacks/meals (about 2 dozen items). Always felt safe with this hotel.  Other points: A bit less than 30 minute walk approx to Medina although pavement under construction (slow construction I think). From main road (not hotel) taxi 20dh to Medina but 40dh back- maybe poor bargaining by me. ATM machine immediately outside hotel entrance was handy Money change service in sight of hotel and tourist bus stops around corner. WiFi unreliable but got access via Opera plaza. Reception and general help / information excellent- special thanks to Nordin. If I was returning to Marrakech I would seriously consider this hotel but would also have a look around at other options for value for money.,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled solo,"North Shields, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fionam664

Red Hotel Marrakech,Travelleddestination wrote a review Aug 2013,40,Number 1 from all 3 star hotels,For a three star hotel this definately has elements that would be provided from four and five star hotels but at same time 3 star elements included.. The customer service cleanliness in all areas of hotel and the swimming pool area are five star for me(I have stayed in five star in Dubai and this pool was better). The location is really good as there is a lot of top quality morrocon restaurants near by plus your American franchises McDonald's and KFC are right opposite the hotel pizza hut is a 10 minute walk... You also have a number of dessert shops nearby. Taxis are easily accessible around the hotel area don't pay more than 20 dhirams for a 5 seater and no more than 60 for a seven seater if you are going jamah el finah where the atmosphere is better in the evening taxi drivers do try to con and start there prices from a ridiculous 150 dhirams tell them 60 dhirams (for a 7 seater) and walk away then they will agree. I suggest when returning from the square take the horse and carriage its beutiful and dont pay more than 60 dhirams for 6 ppl on one carriage. The hotel rooms are limited but very clean and get cleaned once a day for you you get two towels air conditioning double or 2 single beds tv bidet toilet shower pretty much three star for me when it comes to the room.. Staff is very helpful they always are ready to help will ring anyone for you from reception desk at no extra cost. You need to be responsible for your belongings make sure they are locked away when you go out as there is a warning in the room. I never used the restaurants in the hotel apart from watching the man u V Chelsea game only had a drink so can't comment :). There is a masseuce available within the hotel pool table wifi in lobby area and bowling alley around the corner. Besides the hotel we did the essaouira excursion which is two hours away from Marrakech it is Beutiful they pick you up from the hotel at 8am and drop you back off for 7pm in essouaira you get more markets and a day on the beach. We paid 900 dhirams for 6ppl which is 150 per person so you can negotiate a good price depending on your haggling skills he originally wanted 300 per person. If you want to do quad biking I suggest do it while your in essouaira than Marrakech as it is much better cause you ride through the beach and better track and you get much better pics we paid 700 dhirams altogether for 6 ppls each with their own quads.. Overall hotel is defo worth it cause we paid ¬£313 (¬£250 of this was flight) per person (3 rooms altogether each with twin beds) for 4 nights including flights with Ryanair that includes baggage fee (I believe that is a bargain price for this hotel)...

The room was clean pleasantly furnished with flat screen TVs and (very necessary) air conditioning. The staff were extremely helpful particularly reception staff for whom nothing was too much trouble. The self service breakfast included hot and cold options as well as the usual continental fare and it varied slightly from day to day.  Our room was at the front of the hotel opposite the railway station and overlooking a busy road into Marrakech. Although it was noisy when sitting on the balcony it was a great place to watch the world go by. The noise was completely shut out when the double doors were closed at night.  I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Marrakech. My only problem was the heat. It was 48 degrees on the day we left (9th Aug).

I find it really hard to understand the previous comment about this hotel. The pool was warm! it fact sometimes it was very warm!! and if you are hot from the sun the pool could feel cold I suppose!! The staff at reception went out of their way to help with anything you asked of them and in fact offered suggestions and tips as to where to go and prices etc. The food was repetitive and if it wasn't for the lady outside cooking crepes etc I could go hungry!! The staff who belonged to the hotel next door could sometimes be a bit surly but we got over that because the weather was beautiful and the pool pool man beds towels supplied etc were great. When we arrived at the hotel the hotel reception went out of their way to find us the right room offering us two keys to look at the rooms to see what we wanted so nice!!! We picked one that had a balcony overlooking the train station - which when you closed BOTH doors was very quiet and the room was air conditioned bliss!!

Red Hotel Marrakech,Pinnkie wrote a review Jul 2013,20,Disappointing Hotel,My partner and I stayed here in May for a week. Most of the hotel staff were helpful and friendly our room was cleaned every day and extra towels provided upon request. The bed was comfortable and we had a good size balcony. However when I booked the hotel I asked for a room at the back of the hotel with a balcony as I am a light sleeper. I also followed up with an email and phone call before we traveled to confirm they could provide this. When we arrived the hotel did not give us a quiet room and staff at reception told us that they no longer had any rooms at the back of the hotel with balconies as they had been taken over by the Royal Opera Plaza. This was extremely frustrating as I had confirmed before we arrived that the hotel could provide what we requested! The staff made no attempt to rectify this. As a result I was woken many times over the entire week with the heavy traffic outside. Apart from this issue I have to say that this hotel is very very basic it had a strange smell & it generally does not have a nice feel to it at all. The decor in public areas and the breakfast room is aged and drab the breakfast is very limited and starchy and certain members of staff have absolutely no customer service skills walking around looking very over-worked. It most definitely lacks that certain something and I would not recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a special experience in Marrakech. The pool at the Opera Plaza which we used was lovely (but could be cold depending on the weather) and the staff at the pool bar were a lot more professional and upbeat. I think this hotel would have been a much better option. I know everyone has different standards but if yours are even above average then there are definitely much nicer places to stay in Marrakech.

The breakfast and dinner we found quite repetitive with the menus not being changed all week.

Red Hotel Marrakech,mickyboyd1 wrote a review Jul 2013,50,A great base for Marrakech,Just returned from the Red Hotel Marrakech after a stay of seven nights. I had read the previous reviews and could not understand those who had complaints to make. For a start we declined the Thomson hotel transfer and took a taxi from the airport.......yes we got stung a bit 150 dirhams....it should have been 100 but the driver initially wanted 250 !....Was still cheaper than taking the Thomson transfer and got us to the hotel quicker.    Once at the hotel check in was easy and the guy on reception Nordin was extremely helpful. We had a room on the second floor overlooking the nightclub underneath and the train station. The complaints about the club are a bit of a joke... its just a late bar which we went to a few times ourselves. There were some local Moroccan bands playing but the noise was not excessive and the double glazed doors of the balcony blocked out any noise. The room was exactly as the hotel pictures depict and the room was clean tasteful and air conditioned. The bed was firm and comfy.    I was a bit confused by the earlier reviews stating that the Red Hotel Shares its facilities with the Opera Plaza Hotel and I had visions of trudging from one hotel to the other when the fact of the matter is that the hotels are connected and you just walk out of the rear o the Red Hotel reception and you are in the pool area of the Opera Plaza.    The pool is amazing very large and refreshing in the 40% + temperatures we had. Towels are supplied and there was always a sunbed and a big parasol to keep the sun off. Breakfast was a huge buffet consisting of scramble and boiled eggs cooked potatoes in cream and cheese wonderful roasted tomatoes we even had cooked sausage one day. There was also cooked meats cheese Fresh and dried fruit yoghurt honey and a vast variety of pastries. There was also a lady just outside who cooked you fresh crepes to order ! It was worth getting up for.    Tips for by the pool... drinks were quite expensive.....This is the Opera Plaza's facility and they were charging 35 Dirham (about ¬£3) for a 2 lt bottle of water.... there is a kiosk on the corner that sells it for about ¬£1.. we even brought the same size water for 50p in other places...If the kiosk is shut go across the road to the train station where there is a shop at really cheap prices for water juice sweets etc etc...    Food is reasonably priced in the hotel and we ate there in the daytime several times club sandwiches burgers nice salads............    Alcohol is pricy.......and the Hotels are about the only place you will get it unless you look hard. About ¬£4 for a small bottle of beer... try the local brew Casablanca.. very nice...    There is a bowling alley underneath the Opera Plaza and we had a couple of games we had the place to our self and you can get a beer in there!    There is a open top bus city tour which stops outside the Opera Plaza. There are two routes which overlap and you can buy a ticket for two days. Well worth doing and takes you to a few sights you may not see otherwise. The Jardin Marjorelle is well worth stopping off at.    We did a lot of walking even in the 40deg heat....What they call the New City is about 20 mins slow walk away and has lots of modern European shops and a nice array of restaurants...We even walked to Jamma El Fna......It was ok as markets go but sells the same stuff as every market you have ever been to....I expected more to be honest due to the travel shows on TV ... The food was mediocre almost bland considering all the spices that are on sale. I would say the cuisine was more French that Moroccan...... Avoid the snake charmers the henna women and the guys with monkeys... On the plus side the atmosphere was great it was brilliant looking at Europeans trying to dress ethnic and looking like idiots............The Orange juice sellers are a must........the best juice you will ever have and very cheap.. 4 dirhams.....    We had the Thomson excursion into the foothills of the Atlas Mountains.. a great day out.....Plenty of scenery and a fantastic lunch...............

Even to the point that we saw Nordin on a night out and he took the trouble in his free time to come over and speak to us. The hotel was situated in a nice lively area about thirty minutes walk away from the main square but you will be glad of the distance between the two.

Red Hotel Marrakech,Sandra564 wrote a review Aug 2013,40,"Perfect base, great staff, enjoyable experience",I found this hotel to be perfect for what we wanted. I find it really hard to understand the previous comment about this hotel. The pool was warm! it fact sometimes it was very warm!! and if you are hot from the sun the pool could feel cold I suppose!! The staff at reception went out of their way to help with anything you asked of them and in fact offered suggestions and tips as to where to go and prices etc. The food was repetitive and if it wasn't for the lady outside cooking crepes etc I could go hungry!! The staff who belonged to the hotel next door could sometimes be a bit surly but we got over that because the weather was beautiful and the pool pool man beds towels supplied etc were great. When we arrived at the hotel the hotel reception went out of their way to find us the right room offering us two keys to look at the rooms to see what we wanted so nice!!! We picked one that had a balcony overlooking the train station - which when you closed BOTH doors was very quiet and the room was air conditioned bliss!! Anyway not sure what people wanted from this quiet reasonably priced hotel - I found it to be exactly what I wanted!!!,Date of stay: July 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sandra564
Red Hotel Marrakech,Pinnkie wrote a review Jul 2013,20,Disappointing Hotel,My partner and I stayed here in May for a week. Most of the hotel staff were helpful and friendly our room was cleaned every day and extra towels provided upon request. The bed was comfortable and we had a good size balcony. However when I booked the hotel I asked for a room at the back of the hotel with a balcony as I am a light sleeper. I also followed up with an email and phone call before we traveled to confirm they could provide this. When we arrived the hotel did not give us a quiet room and staff at reception told us that they no longer had any rooms at the back of the hotel with balconies as they had been taken over by the Royal Opera Plaza. This was extremely frustrating as I had confirmed before we arrived that the hotel could provide what we requested! The staff made no attempt to rectify this. As a result I was woken many times over the entire week with the heavy traffic outside. Apart from this issue I have to say that this hotel is very very basic it had a strange smell & it generally does not have a nice feel to it at all. The decor in public areas and the breakfast room is aged and drab the breakfast is very limited and starchy and certain members of staff have absolutely no customer service skills walking around looking very over-worked. It most definitely lacks that certain something and I would not recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a special experience in Marrakech. The pool at the Opera Plaza which we used was lovely (but could be cold depending on the weather) and the staff at the pool bar were a lot more professional and upbeat. I think this hotel would have been a much better option. I know everyone has different standards but if yours are even above average then there are definitely much nicer places to stay in Marrakech.

Red Hotel Marrakech,manojs718 wrote a review Jul 2013,40,"Good Location, Wonderful Holiday!",Arrived from Marrakech this morning having spent a week at The Red Hotel with my daughter. We travelled with Thomsons and found the company and resort rep Rashid very helpful! The Red Hotel is a good central location for travelling to markets and central square! The rooms are clean and comfortable - they are cleaned everyday including Sunday. The service provided by the reception staff Nordin and Ayman was exceptional making us feel welcome at all times. The breakfast and dinner we found quite repetitive with the menus not being changed all week. Being Vegetarians we found the choice limited but once we had worked out what the vegetarian options were we found the food to be tasty. Evening entertainment at the pool side could be improved but the pool area itself of The Opera Plaza Hotel was clean with fresh towels being provided on a daily basis by the helpful pool attendant. Overall well done Nordin and Ayman!!!

Red Hotel Marrakech,mickyboyd1 wrote a review Jul 2013,50,A great base for Marrakech,Just returned from the Red Hotel Marrakech after a stay of seven nights. I had read the previous reviews and could not understand those who had complaints to make. For a start we declined the Thomson hotel transfer and took a taxi from the airport.......yes we got stung a bit 150 dirhams....it should have been 100 but the driver initially wanted 250 !....Was still cheaper than taking the Thomson transfer and got us to the hotel quicker.    Once at the hotel check in was easy and the guy on reception Nordin was extremely helpful. We had a room on the second floor overlooking the nightclub underneath and the train station. The complaints about the club are a bit of a joke... its just a late bar which we went to a few times ourselves. There were some local Moroccan bands playing but the noise was not excessive and the double glazed doors of the balcony blocked out any noise. The room was exactly as the hotel pictures depict and the room was clean tasteful and air conditioned. The bed was firm and comfy.    I was a bit confused by the earlier reviews stating that the Red Hotel Shares its facilities with the Opera Plaza Hotel and I had visions of trudging from one hotel to the other when the fact of the matter is that the hotels are connected and you just walk out of the rear o the Red Hotel reception and you are in the pool area of the Opera Plaza.    The pool is amazing very large and refreshing in the 40% + temperatures we had. Towels are supplied and there was always a sunbed and a big parasol to keep the sun off. Breakfast was a huge buffet consisting of scramble and boiled eggs cooked potatoes in cream and cheese wonderful roasted tomatoes we even had cooked sausage one day. There was also cooked meats cheese Fresh and dried fruit yoghurt honey and a vast variety of pastries. There was also a lady just outside who cooked you fresh crepes to order ! It was worth getting up for.    Tips for by the pool... drinks were quite expensive.....This is the Opera Plaza's facility and they were charging 35 Dirham (about ¬£3) for a 2 lt bottle of water.... there is a kiosk on the corner that sells it for about ¬£1.. we even brought the same size water for 50p in other places...If the kiosk is shut go across the road to the train station where there is a shop at really cheap prices for water juice sweets etc etc...

Red Hotel Marrakech,Scubadiver10002 wrote a review Jan 2013,20,You get what you pay for,"This is a very basic hotel on a very busy main road close to a very busy roundabout opposite the railway station. Based on other reviews we asked for a room high up near the back. We were given a room low down on the front. The next day after complaining to the Thomson rep we wer switched to a room ""high up at the back"". Our first room was incredibly noisy from the road and the disco. It smelt badly of damp and wasnt particularly clean. The room we moved to was very quiet didnt smell and was clean from start to finish. I have a medical condition which requires me to sleep a bit upright - on the first evening I asked for 4 extra pillows. The request was received with disbelief so I said 2 would do. A few hours later after dinner no sign of the pillows. My wife asked again and the reception said they would be there soon. They didnt arrive. When we moved rooms we ""stole"" the pillows from the 1st room so we had a total of 4 pillows. A while later there was a knock at the door of our new room and the housekeeper asked for the pillows we had taken. She intimated that the hotel only had 2 pillows per room. I politely declined and we kept the pillows locking them in a suitcase each day. Facilities shared with Opera Plaza so not bad albeit expensive. Overall if you want cheep and are prepared to have any reasonable requests resisted this hotel may be fine.

Red Hotel Marrakech,clubable wrote a review Jan 2013,30,I want to escape the endless and repetitive pool side canned music,"Rooms nice only had room service once. Quality of food below average.  Breakfast repetitive and not great selection if you don't want sweet pasteries to start your day.  About a 30 to 40 minute walk along highly polluted main road to get to old town. Nothing much to see in this ""new town"" some of the pavements / side walks remind one of London - during the blitz.  Asthma succeeded beware! I needed frequent use on inhaler when near main roads and I live in a city.  The hotel is new and the building is pleasant if somewhat anonymous. It is impossible to get away from the canned and intrusive music in the lobby and beside the pool. Sun badgers with headphones were at least able to block this out but for those of us without the only place to read was in ones room. Very sad because the pool area and lobby is pleasant enough.  The Red Hotel is cheaper and joined to the Plaza. It shares all the Plazas facilities. As far as I can see the only difference are the actual guest rooms the Plaza being finished to a higher spec. If you want peace a garden an easy stroll to the city - consider other options.

Red Hotel Marrakech,Agnieszka C wrote a review Dec 2012,30,did not meet the expectations,We arrived at the hotel on 26th November and stayed there a week. UnfortunateIy I was very dissapointed with the overall experience. First of all don't stay there if you don't like noisy places. You won't be able to sleep at night because of the noises coming from both the main street which is quite busy 24 7 and the hotel bar where a loud music is played till very late at night. Secondly although the hotel offers a pool with the snack bar it was never open even when the weather was nice! Another thing there's no free wifi in the room. You can access it free in the lobby but don't expect the connection to be strong enough to enable Skype conversation. The good thing is our room got cleaned every day but the bed in the room was just not comfortable at all. Breakfast was average very little choice and the same food every day.,Date of stay: November 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leeds, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AgnieszkaC_12

Red Hotel Marrakech,sfuhere wrote a review Oct 2012,40,Good location if you want to be in the new town,This is a very fresh clean and modern hotel situated directly opposite the new train station. It is therefore really convenient if you want to use Marrakesh as a base for exploring other parts of Morocco as all the transport links are within a short walking distance. Also ideal if you arrive after a long journey and just want to flop somewhere as soon as possible!    Inside everything is finished to a good standard and the rooms are comfortable enough though not luxurious and not particularly big. The hotel opened within the past year so everything is new. Beds are a little on the hard side but perfectly ok. The shower was excellent. Rooms also have a reasonably sized balcony and ours looked out onto the train station which was an impressive view.    The main downside of staying here is the noise. It's right next to a busy roundabout and Moroccan drivers are unfortunately very horn-happy so even with two double-glazed doors and thick curtains some noise will come through. If you're a light sleeper it might be best to stay elsewhere or at least request a room round the side. However despite the noise on the whole we slept ok. This isn't the place to go if you want a very quiet and relaxing holiday though it's more of a city break/travelling base.    The bar/lounge was quite busy with hip young Moroccans on the shisha pipe and this seems to be the latest trendy place in Marrakesh. It's very European in style and design and it's not always obvious you're in Morocco - that could be seen as a good thing or not depending on your preferences. They play Western music in the restaurant for example - usually the same songs... Hotel California and We Are The World being two favourites! The breakfasts are fine with a decent choice and they do a set menu each night for about 120dh which was rather good when we ate there. Very French style food as you would expect.    The pool bar on the roof was shut during our stay but we had access to the Opera Plaza pool next door instead which was great. There were loads of spare sunloungers and it's a good sized pool. In fact the Red Hotel and the Opera Plaza are really two hotels in one building and I'm not clear what difference there really is between the two. You can for example walk along the corridors between the two hotels on each floor. Could it be that the noisiest rooms are put in the Red Hotel which is why it's a bit cheaper? I'm not sure. Anyway officially the ground floor pool area is not part of the Red Hotel so I don't know whether you would be guaranteed to get access to it during high season. We were given the run of the place but it wasn't full so that might be why. As the Opera Plaza is higher classed and more expensive it felt like we got a bargain staying at the Red but using their facilities.    This is an good choice for a city break if you prefer staying in the new town. If you want to be close to the medina and Jemaa el Fna this is at least half an hour's walk away and we found it a bit far to walk there and back especially when it's hot. Taxis should be about 30dh each way though you will have to bargain to get that - you will be asked for 50dh. Finally I do want to mention the staff who were extremely helpful and professional throughout. They also speak pretty good English.,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,uk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sfuhere

Red Hotel Marrakech,Alejandra M wrote a review May 2012,10,Robbery in 'Red Hotel': Camera and 150‚Ç¨,During the night from 7th to 8th May 150‚Ç¨ and our digital camera were stolen from the room. We entered the hotel for 1 night at 21h had a shower and went out for dinner for about 2 hours. At 1am we came back to the room and we couldn't sleep at all because of the noise of the pub/bar/lounge/disco behind. Amazing how a hotel can have a disco in the basis!! AMAZING. The whole building was shaking with the music I just read another comment with the same.  We urged the receptionist to change the room as far from the music as possible. As we packed our staff to move to the new room we couldn't find the camera anymore and 150‚Ç¨ neither.  CANCEL RESERVATIONS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  The police was correct but as usual you are a tiny turist they speak arab among them and you have no chance to explain yourself correctly....

Red Hotel Marrakech,hib77 wrote a review Mar 2012,30,Great location,Great location. Situated across from the train station and Mcdonalds. Only a short stroll away from a very nice park and the new city with boutique stalls. The taxi drivers dont seem to know where this hotel is as its very new so be sure to mention the Opera hotel which is just next door. The hotel is very nice everything is new inside. We came across a small problem one night when we needed some drinking water and the hotel bar closes early so we had to pay over the odds for a bottle of water which someone from the hotel went to get for us 'supposedly' from a shop elsewhere. The room was nice but there was a disgusting smell in the bathroom which we can only assume was coming from the drains as when we put the plugs in and closed the toilet seat it seemed to get a little less. Tip- be sure to take water with you to the hotel for evening as its too expensive there. I think this hotel is great for the price they charge.,Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Preston, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hib77
Red Hotel Marrakech,HarrogateScribe wrote a review Feb 2012,30,Bad bed at The Red,It couldn‚Äôt be a more convenient place to stay for tourists using Marrakech as a gateway and planning to do a bit of travelling to other parts of Morocco. The Red Hotel is situated directly opposite Marrakech‚Äôs sparkling new railway station which offers services to some of Morocco‚Äôs other big cities including Casablanca Fes and Tangier. The hotel is also just a few minutes‚Äô walk from the Supratours bus depot which operates services to Esasaouira and Agadir.  I stayed at the Red Hotel in January 2012 when it had only been open a month. From the front and in the reception area it looked like a clean smart three-star business-oriented hotel.  Unfortunately I found my guestroom (which is what really counts) much less impressive. The bed was really poor. I know I booked a single room but it seemed to be the narrowest possible single bed; almost like trying to sleep on a plank of wood. And just as uncomfortable.  For a hotel obviously aimed at business travellers and conference delegates (since it‚Äôs situated close to the city‚Äôs Palais des Congress) you‚Äôve got to wonder whose idea it was to penny-pinch and provide really narrow beds in single rooms rather than queen-size beds? The room was also poorly lit and noisy from the traffic outside. If you‚Äôre building a new hotel on a busy Marrakech street wouldn‚Äôt you have considered installing really good soundproofing?  One would have assumed another thought would have been that if you‚Äôre the new kid on the block you would want to go out of your way to try and make a good impression on guests? But I sensed there‚Äôs already a complacency among the staff. They couldn‚Äôt even deal efficiently with the most straightforward of requests. I noticed that a bulb in the bathroom wasn‚Äôt working so I asked at reception if it could be replaced? They assured me that wasn‚Äôt a problem. More than 12 hours later I returned to my room to discover the bulb hadn‚Äôt been changed. I asked again at reception but 45 minutes later no-one had appeared; so I asked again. Finally a guy came to change the bulb ‚Äì a job which took him two minutes.  On one of the two mornings I stayed I decided to sample the buffet breakfast which was available at a supplement of about UK¬£5. I must have spent nearly half an hour in the dining room ‚Äì but was the only guest and it felt rather awkward as I was continually watched over by a female member of staff. It wasn‚Äôt a bad spread although the coffee was stewed and the orange juice came from a bottle or carton when there‚Äôs really no excuse for not serving fresh orange juice in Morocco. What made the experience even more depressing was that the net curtains were kept drawn making the dining room feel as gloomy as an old people‚Äôs home. I asked if the curtains could be opened but was told: No. The management had declared they must remain drawn; though goodness knows why.  If one wanted to be kind one could say all the criticisms I‚Äôve made are teething problems which one would expect from a newly-opened hotel. But I‚Äôll be interested to keep an eye on reviews from other guests to see how quickly things improve. And indeed whether they do.,Date of stay: January 2012,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Harrogate, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pcl58
