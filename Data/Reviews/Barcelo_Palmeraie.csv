Barcelo Palmeraie,Benjy2 wrote a review Mar 24,30,Not quite what I expected,I chose this hotel based on the fact that it is 5 star all inclusive but unfortunately I was a bit disappointed with some aspects of the hotel.  The main entrance of the hotel is stunning. Check in was quick and the lady at reception told us about the restaurants at the hotel. We were then taken to our room on a buggy which was very good. The grounds of the hotel are extensive. Very beautiful and green. Well looked after. The rooms are set quite a long walk from the pools restaurants and main part of the hotel. Anyone with mobility issues would find it a bit of a problem going to and from their room. Our room was supposed to be superior but I was quite disappointed with it. It was smaller than I expected. There is no wardrobe just a hanging rail and 2 small drawers. And it was very tired and in need of decorating. There were mosquitoes in the bathroom that dive bombed me when I had a shower. I think they came in from a broken vent. We never saw any mosquitoes when we were outside only in our bathroom. There was a kettle with tea and coffee but no milk. I didn't need milk but thought it unusual not to have any. I also thought we had a mini bar but in fact all we had was an empty fridge. This room was more 3/4* than 5*.On our first night I discovered that all inclusive doesn't actually mean all inclusive. There are 2 classes of all Inclusive and we were the one that didn't include the specialist restaurants most drinks and food at the pool bar at lunchtime. We could use those facilities but would need to pay for them. To me that isn't all inclusive. We were miss sold the holiday by the holiday company with this. The restaurant for my all inclusive was a buffet and the food choices weren't great. I've been to other all inclusive hotels with buffets but this one really wasn't good enough.  The hotel has 2 pools. The Zen pool which is quiet and the big pool. The pool looks lovely but the main problem for me was the slope going into the pool. It was very steep and slippery. I slipped and hurt my shoulder going in and I saw numerous people slip and hurt themselves. I've never seen so many people fall in a hotel swimming pool and I've been to a lot of hotels! The are sun beds round the pool but not a huge amount so I'm not sure what happens in tge height of summer. The hotel does a free shuttle bus than runs hourly into Marrakesh and is free. There is a gap of 3 hours between 12.30 and 3.30pm. The bus stops at the Tui Medina Gardens hotel. It's then about 20 minutes walk to the main part of Marrakesh. There were no directions to help us get to the centre and we found it a bit daunting. The roads are challenging to get across. 5 lanes of fast moving traffic that doesn't stop when you try and cross the road. Terrifying!  The best thing about the hotel was the staff. They were lovely. Always polite smiling and helpful. The barman remembered our drinks every night and Kamal at the pool was great doing the sports.  Unfortunately I won't come back to this hotel. There are too many things that aren't right. And it was very quiet. No atmosphere in the evening. This hotel could be amazing. The rooms need freshening up and the all inclusive needs to be all inclusive.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Mangotsfield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Benjy2
Barcelo Palmeraie,ChefCliveM wrote a review Mar 10,40,Lovely hotel excellent in every way,This hotel is truly five star. We had a wonderful executive suite with a great view and the surrounding gardens were kept to an exceptionally high standard. There is a heated pool for families and all other guests. However if you want some peace and solitude there is a quiet pool for guests where children phones dogs are banned. My only negative comment is that I prefer a five star hotel to have no children as I’m passed that now. However that was my problem and in general the kids were quite well-behaved even if the adults weren’t.    There was evening entertainment which was most enjoyable and being a B+ guest we had all the frills without any of the spills. I highly recommend this wonderful hotel which also offers regular shuttle bus trips to the centre of Marrakesh.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChefCliveM

Barcelo Palmeraie,Muhammed Ali wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Great family holiday,Me and my family had a great stay here customers service was second to non from our experience hotel had great facilities which included childrens play club with a small farm and the play centre team were very accommodating (play centre at additional cost just for reference) the food was great with good variety and changed up menu every day also staff very attentive would love to mention name but have forgotten. Noting is perfect so last bit I wanted to say the toilet could have done with some re grouting or touch up but we were offered another room so no hard fellings. but if you want to be in or around the city centre not for you unless your happy taking there shuttle bus which we did free and every hour. all in all have been recommending to friends and family,Date of stay: December 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V3321WEmohammeda

Barcelo Palmeraie,BusinessTraveller981 wrote a review Feb 2023,10,Downgraded by disinterested staff,We stayed at Barcelo Palmeirae for a family trip and my son’s first time travelling outside Europe. Unfortunately our experience was bitterly disappointing.    On arrival we asked to be upgraded to a room with a bathtub which wasn’t available on arrival but were told it would be available 2 days later.    We agreed to this with the reception staff and paid the deposit only to find out on the day we were meant for to move to our new room that it had been given to other guests.    Our whole family was quite disappointed given that even the second best rooms are pretty dated and small.    On trying to find out what happened the staff were pretty disinterested and even were laughing at mine and my wife’s frustration with this.    In the midst of the discussion the manager just walked away and when I asked the receptionist where she was we were told that she’d gone to ‘speak to reservations’ when she was clearly visible just sitting with a tray by the bar.    All in all a negative experience made worse by the theatrics of the disinterested staf,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BusinessTraveller981
Barcelo Palmeraie,no name wrote a review Feb 2023,10,Some rude staff,Some reception staff need retraining on manners and customer facing etiquette.

Barcelo Palmeraie,lynsb15 wrote a review Feb 2023,50,"Beautiful, quiet and friendly hotel",The grounds are v lovely the rooms v comfortable and the staff v attentive.  We came for a 3 night break to simply rest unwind and enjoy some blue skies. This really was the perfect place for us.  The gardens are lovely to walk around and there are plenty of places to relax. The hotel is a quiet peaceful and a stress free place to be. The beds were very comfortable rooms v clean and well heated (it gets chilly at night in early Feb). We slept so well.  The all inclusive has a great range of drinks and food all well presented. Whilst not out of this world food was good and definitely represented value for money.  There is also handy shuttle in to town.,Date of stay: February 2023,,"Horsham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lynsb15

Barcelo Palmeraie,Caroline A wrote a review Jan 2023,40,Great people and service,We stayed for about a week at the Barcelo on the all inclusive. The best thing about the stay was the staff. A special shout out to Hicham and the bar staff!    For such a big place they could really invest in improving the gym - it was so lacking we ended up barely using it.    Seems like a good place for families with young kids.    Thanks to the Barcelo team for a lovely stay!,Date of stay: January 2023,,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolineaL7137GE
Barcelo Palmeraie,Mayank A wrote a review Jan 2023,10,"Terrible Service and Food, Nice property but poorly mamaged",Terrible experience staying in this property. When we got in heat was not working in our room. The food was terrible throughout with no to limited options for us being vegetarian[no meat fish or chicken]. There was less accommodation for our requests as well. Further we has an all-inclusive booking but our treatment was as normal customers. And the all-inclusive has so many rules exclusions etc. that you would keep figuring out what is included vs. not. The wine included in the plan was terrible.,Date of stay: December 2022,,"Noida, India",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/431mayanka

Barcelo Palmeraie,jane wrote a review Dec 2022,30,Safety concern for family,We visited as a family first time in this hotel the first family room was taken has issue with sliding door  they have given us another one which has drain blockage issue. It was too late  we just went to sleep.    On the 2nd day we contacted the receptionist which kindly looked into the issue the blockage sorted but there us still leakage between the shower screen and the floor  we contacted again and again for 4 occasions it is day 7 we still have the same problem. Checking out today we told the receptionist again it is not very safe to let the room out for another family I even spoke with the manager in the reception area they told us it is not our problem someone else will be there tonight despite our concerns    Travelled with our kids for the past 10 years it is the worst experience we have experienced when we have safety concern.

Barcelo Palmeraie,TheLeonards2000 wrote a review Dec 2022,50,Lovely oasis a short drive away from the bustle of Marrakesh,What a great hotel it is a little tired in some areas but nothing major at all and it certainly didn’t affect our stay. The pool is super clean and the gardens are well maintained. The staff absolutely made the stay 5* they are all friendly helpful and will do anything then can to make your stay a good one. We only had breakfast at the hotel and there was plenty of choice freshly made breads eggs and whatever else you need.    We loved the fact we had the calm of the hotel and could just jump on the free shuttle into Marrakesh or the fab reception staff would organise us a cab.    We stayed in room 203 very comfy big bed sofa area and a little table. Bathroom has shampoo and conditioner and a hairdryer. If you like a cup of coffee in the morning I’d advise to bring some we did get one sachet each every day but could’ve done with more but that’s just us!    We would definitely stay here should we visit Marrakesh again.

Barcelo Palmeraie,shezzy786 wrote a review Nov 2022,50,The hotel made our holiday!!,This hotel is truly magnificent and so grand! The grounds are stunning and so well maintained and really nice pools outside too.    The interior is so beautiful.    There is a free bus running to and from the main market where Jamaa el fnaa is throughout the day.    There also have their own taxi rank fixed at 150dh per trip.    There is so much variety with the food. We went for half board as we were usually out for lunches. On the days where we were out for dinner the hotel kindly allowed us to switch dinners to lunches.    The service from the staff is exceptional and our stay was made more pleasurable by Yassine and Amine.    Especially Yassine as he helped me plan a few things for my sisters birthday but overall both of them helped us throughout our stay and just made things easy for us. Thank you Yassine and Amine.

Barcelo Palmeraie,Lucy W wrote a review Oct 2022,40,Great value!,We were a group of 7 (including 3 x U18s). The hotel was recommended by our local travel agent.  It was a little bit further from the centre of Marrakech than we expected (we hadn't taken into account the traffic which can add to travel times considerably!) but the free minibus service from the hotel worked well. It was lovely to return to our spacious and calm surroundings after the hustle and bustle of the Medina. The pool area is lovely and the staff very friendly and helpful especially around the pool and at the bar.  Our rooms were very clean and everything worked well. There was a very distinct smell of drains in our rooms at times (!) but seeing as we were out during the day it didn't really matter.  The buffet style food in the main restaurant is excellent with lots of choice. The table service for drinks can be v slow at times but the all inclusive rate made our whole stay excellent value for money.  Would recommend especially for families with children.,Date of stay: October 2022,,"Winchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lucyw690

Barcelo Palmeraie,MNI wrote a review Oct 2022,20,Disappointing hotel,It is sad that I need to write a negative review for the hotel but standards are very low and it is more 3 star and now where near 5.    The hotel is set in wonderful grounds and the gardeners are the hardest working. The more junior staff in the restaurant and those in the main bar also work hard however sadly that is where the good parts of the hotel end.    If you did decide to come here a few points you should know:    1 Food very repetitive with no themes. There are also not enough signs letting you know what the food on the buffet is so it’s often a gamble. Senior staff in the main restaurant tend to want to stand around and chat to each other rather than help the junior staff who run around clearing plates and getting your drinks.    2. Staff are in the main very unfriendly. There is rarely any offer of help or even in the morning no morning greeting. They just ignore you like you are not there. Attitude is poor.    3. Whilst most staying here are on all inclusive you can only get drinks at one of the two pool bars despite the ‘zen’ pool being fully stocked. Indeed we were told that this pool wasn’t really for all inclusive guests and we should be grateful that they let us sit on the sun loungers and they would give us bottled water. A customer experience manager from the hotel actually told us this as we sat by the pool. Shocking to be honest.    4. Bedrooms very basic and akin to the UK travelodge. Small and in need of a lot of maintenance. Paint flaking off walls. You get a kettle but if you want t bags you need to hunt them down at breakfast and take them to your room.    Apparently the hotel is due some renovation. Sadly though if they don’t change the small things and encourage staff to start to show some politeness and welcome to guests I can’t see the hotel receiving much positive comment from guests. Behaviour and attitude costs nothing and would probably make the biggest difference.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Woking, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mozct
Barcelo Palmeraie,djcrt wrote a review Oct 2022,20,Disappointing hotel - does not live up to its 5 star status,I have never written a critical trip advisor review before but having been led to believe from previous reviews of this hotel that it was a fantastic hotel I feel moved to write a review on how I experienced the hotel.    Starting with the positives…    The hotel is set in lovely grounds and the garden maintenance team do a really good job at maintaining the gardens and they look great.  The pool areas are really nice - pools are clean (if a little chilly) with comfy sun beds lovely towels and bars with drinks and snacks.  The location is fine unless you want to be able to walk to the Medina. The hotel puts on a free regular shuttle to and from the Medina which is really useful.  Some of the staffbut sadly they are the minority want to ensure their guests have a really good stay. I feel I must call out Hajiba Walida Khalida and Mouad and few more junior staff in the restaurant who stood out amongst their peers. Please do send all your staff to the training that these members of the team went on. They make their customers feel welcome they try to go the extra mile.  However….the elements that leave this hotel far from 5 star..  - the rooms are clean but tired - our first room had a toilet door that wouldn’t close. On returning to reception we did not receive an apology but simply a “we will change your room”. Having read more reviews since arriving here I see that needing to change rooms is not an infrequent situation.  - The food - it is ok with nice salads and breads and some nice dishes however it is very repetitive and would be impossible if you were vegetarian or gluten free as everything is mixed and there are few signs so you are never that clear on what you are eating.  - If you are not a smoker and are not keen on someone smoking next to you at meals or by the pool you might be disappointed. Despite signs saying no smoking by the pool this happened every day and also there are no designated areas at meal times.  - My biggest disappointment was the lack of customer service amongst many of the staff. All too often when you approach a member of staff they look frustrated to be approached they tell you what you need to do to find whatever it is you are looking for rather than attempt to help. There are tables left uncleared despite staff nearby yesterday’s drinks still by the pool despite three members of staff to man a quiet bar area. That bar the Zen bar will only serve bottled water to all inclusive guests making people walk to the other pool bar if they want any other all inclusive drinks.  -  - The reason this is the most disappointing area is that my experience of the supervisors and managers is that this is the culture and so all the refurbishments in the world would not change the experience the guest will have until there is a mindset change at the top and through the teams.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Woking, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/djcrt
Barcelo Palmeraie,Carl L wrote a review Oct 2022,30,"Great site, poorly maintained",First impressions are great as you enter the hotel with the architecture and art work in the grounds. A warm welcome at reception and excellent WiFi all sets good expectations.  We then went to the pool and encountered the three pool bar staff who consistently prefer to talk rather than servicing guests much to everyone’s annoyance. Away from the pool bar the waiters and main bar staff are very efficient and friendly.  The main restaurant has a good standard of food however it has not changed so far this week. The two other restaurants are chargeable so have been empty during our stay.  As with most people I eat and drink more on holiday and as such like to go to the gym unlike the hotel pictures there is only one treadmill and broken weights machines which was a great disappointment.  The fountain is a key feature of the gardens however the lake is stagnant green so I haven’t seen the boats used. The rest of the gardens in and two pools are very well maintained.  Our double room needs a facelift the air con is good however lights don’t work and the bathroom needs a refit.  The hotel seems popular for conferences which puts a strain on the staff at meal times and evening bar service.  The hotel did have good reviews however knowing what we know now I wouldn’t have selected this one.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E6489JOcarll
Barcelo Palmeraie,RagnarBelial wrote a review Oct 2022,30,Worth the money with some caveats,While the hotel itself is very nice and staff incredibly friendly there are a few things needing pointing out.  We were two couples in two rooms and we both had to change them. One couple had a broken air con and the other had no cold water in the shower. Neither of those is very helpful after a day in the heat outside.  The bar has a very limited choice of drinks as a part of all-inclusive and the service is very slow. We observed two members of staff chatting at the bar while we waited up to 45 minutes for a drink one evening.  Make sure you check the end bill as they keep poor records of what was charged to the room and what was already paid. In our case the wanted to charge us again for the hotel taxi we were using and paid at the reception.  Still a very pleasing stay with very friendly staff. Their Wi-Fi coverage across the hotel is incredible.,Date of stay: October 2022,,High Wycombe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RagnarBelial

Barcelo Palmeraie,Michele P wrote a review Sep 2022,30,Mini Trip,Initial appearance very clean modern hotel. Staff are lovely and very helpful.  Negative points: Food repetitive we stayed 4 nights and that was enough. Rooms: 3 couples in our group one couple was issued a room for a disabled person! Unfortunately I was not aware to get this changed till our second day realising when they said their sink was so low to the floor and I went to have a look and realised what this room was for but too late to change as we were only staying for 4 nights not worth the hassle. One room was OK and our room well needs a little TLC plus the patio doors did not lock. I complained 3 times and was told this would be fixed or we would be moved.... this never happened and I gave up as more hassle and again as we were only there 4 nights just wanted to enjoy our stay.  I do not consider myself to be a fussy person and accept you are in a different country that has different standards so I leave you all to make your own conclusions but bear these comments in mind. We were out on trips each day and half board so it served its purpose for us. Would I want a week stay here sorry to say no.  The pool area is lovely and no worries with getting a sunbed plus you get towels.  Maid service was good. Clean towels every day and beds made and turned down in the evening with a chocolate on your pillow lovely touch.  We went with 2 other couples to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary which I did email to let them know. Thought we might have got an added extra by mentioning this as some hotels are good at that we did not but then I guess we would if we had paid more.  Experience of Moroccan people absolutely lovely and changed my thoughts entirely to what I had expected.  Shuttle bus to and from the centre which is approximately 25 minutes away so very handy. Reception will also help you if you require a taxi etc and very helpful.  To sum up a lovely 4 night stay to get the experience of Morocco but the hotel did have a few disappointing issues but didn't spoil our mini break.,Date of stay: September 2022,,"Colchester, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/869michelep

Barcelo Palmeraie,samgees wrote a review Sep 2022,50,A fantastic stay in Marrakech,We had a fantastic 9 days at Barcelo Palmeraie.    It was my fourth trip to Marrakech and there’s a lot of competition for quality hotels and we settled on this hotel as the deal was great for 4 of us staying in one room. We had a suite so our girls could stay in a room themselves (the lounge area) without being in a separate room and we didn’t regret our choice.    From arriving the room was spotless and the air con was perfect all week keeping the room really cool during the height of summer.    The facilities of the hotel were great. We spent time every day by the pool ate in two of the restaurants where the food was fantastic and the bar area was really nice.    We really must state how amazing the staff were all through the hotel. From the restaurant to the pool the bar to the room staff they were all lovely people who day after day went the extra mile for us. We couldn’t be more happier with the people who served us so well and want to say a huge thank you to them.    After 9 days we didn’t want to leave. I definitely want to come back. Thanks to the hotel for a wonderful holiday.    We had a car for the duration as we definitely aren’t people to stay in a resort. We could get anywhere in Marrakech within about 20 minutes and so while the hotel wasn’t central it was well located for everything. Without a car it would take taxis or tourist transport to get around.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samgees

Breakfast was included and the food is a bit repetitive the same every day but still plenty of choice. Beautiful gardens lovingly tendered. 2 pools one for children and one for adults. Great entertainment in the evenings. They have a free bus to the city you just need to notify at the reception when you want to go and come back.

Barcelo Palmeraie,Aaron wrote a review Aug 2022,40,Lovely Trip away,Just come back from a week in Marrakech staying at the Barceló Palmeraie  staff were friendly resort was well maintained  always seeing grounds people keeping the gardens clean  room was lovely and kept clean also  Fresh and different food everyday  with the outdoor bbq being used most lunch and dinner times    Hotel offers a taxi service if you were going anywhere specific which we used to and from a hassam for 100MAD  Also free shuttle service into the median    Tiny little issues was the main bar in the evenings were understaffed so you’d have 1 waiter doing the whole area and you could be waiting a while for a drink    Sit down meals again you’d be waiting a while for drinks and top ups    Breakfast would open at 7am . Lunch from 12 and dinner from 7.30pm  me and my partner are early birds so would get to breakfast for 7.30 am but no tables would be layed and food still covered up or not out  which we didn’t mind waiting but if food is served from 7am you would expect it ready let alone at 7.30  was the same for lunch and dinner    Also wondered why if your all inclusive why you couldn’t get drinks from the adult pool but you could at the kids pool ? but you could if you were paying at the adult pool    Again these were tiny issues but as a whole we both had a lovely time,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Southampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Odyssey51464292565
Barcelo Palmeraie,Man-from-CFL wrote a review Aug 2022,40,Nice hotel outside the city,Stayed for two nights whilst in Marrakech on business. The hotel is located in the Palmeraie to the north east of Marrakech. The hotel is set in very nice grounds with the rooms in small blocks surrounded by trees. Very quiet location with plenty of parking available. The room was a good size and nicely decorated; comfortable bed and good shower the WIFI was useable. The room had Air-con but it was not needed when I visited in February. I ate at the hotel on the first night buffet style restaurant with a good selection of options. Breakfast was also had a good selection of options to choose from. Due to the location of the hotel unless you have a car or arrange for many taxis you are likely to be eating at the hotel a lot.,Date of stay: February 2022,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Man-from-CFL
Barcelo Palmeraie,michael o wrote a review Aug 2022,50,Just returned home after 7 days at Barcelo Palmeraie,My wife daughter mother in-law and I have just returned from a superb week at this Hotel. We booked two rooms all inclusive for the week. Upon checking in we found our classic superior too small and with very little storage for clothes for 2 adults and a 7 year old. Son in the morning we upgraded to the suite room 549 which was large and really nice with a walkin wardrobe. My mother in-law who has mobility issues wqs also moved to another room which was on ground floor and closer to us.  Food - I dont particulary like buffets but this has to be the best buffet restaraunt i have had plenty of choice variation and a real mix of french and moroccan cuisine. The desserts were amazing. Our daughter has a dairy allergy and the staff could not have been better in accomodating for my daughters requirements. I dont think they had seen many guests with this type of allergy. From the head chef chefs and restaruant staff they really went above and beyond and made by daughter lunches and dinners from scratch and brought her Almond and Chocolate soya milk for her breakfast. The staff continually made sure we were happy and that my daughter was being looked after. One night we went to the Moroccan A La Carte restaurant which was really nice and on last night we went to a Morrocan meal/show which had live music and dancers this was in the superb setting of the gardens outside the Moroccan restaurant.  During the day - We spent the days at the kids pool which was lively fun with good water aerobics at 12pm. Never had an issue with getting beds. The Poolside staff and entertainment team were good fun and welcoming. My daughter used the Kids club most days and to be honest its got to the best kids club we have experienced. The kids club has live animals go karting climbing walls  trampolines. One day they brought Camels in for the kids to ride organsied pottery classes took them kayaking and setup a water slide at the kids pool. Our daughter loved this.  At night - After dinenr we drank in the main bar which was nice comfortable and air conditioned with outdoor seating if you wished. They have some great inclusive cocktails and bar staff there are really good.  Outside they had a DJ playing music and had live singers and guitarists which was nice to chill out to. One question though at the Adults pool you are charged to order alcoholic drinks there but can order at kids pool and bring these drinks to Adult Pool i wasnt too sure why this was. It would also be helpful if the buffet food description labels came with allergy information.  Day trip - At reception we organsied an english speaking tour guide to take us to the Medina Souks and Yves Saint Laurent gardens. This trip was excellent and our guide Mohammed was very knowlegeable and made the tour fun.  Conclusion - This was out first time in Morroco and we are so glad we chose the Barcelo Palmeraie we will definelty be back we had a great family,Date of stay: August 2022,,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelo474
Barcelo Palmeraie,K-L-C87 wrote a review Aug 2022,40,Warm and welcoming stay,We ended up at the Barcelo when our original hotel had overbooked. They were welcoming and reassuring when we arrived stressed and confused in the middle of the night.    Reception staff are very helpful and speak excellent English.    The free shuttle to Marrakech was great and easy to book.    Our room was very clean spacious very comfortable bed and rainhead shower with a nice terrace area.    Rooms were cleaned at least once a day usually twice.    The pools and surrounding areas were very clean and not too busy. We could usually find a sunbed.    The food was pretty good although the breakfast and desserts weren't to my taste.    The bar staff did their best but seemed stressed and run off their feet at times possibly due to the influx of unexpected extra guests from the other hotel.    The food serving times at the bars/ restaurant weren't overly clear on the menus and some of it is not included in the all inclusive rate.    There was not much evening entertainment. The one show they did have on was tucked away in a 'conference room' and nobody told us about it so we missed out on that entirely. Otherwise in the evenings it was mostly music with the occasional live singer but very quiet atmosphere.    Would recommend if you want a quiet peaceful place a good distance away from the chaos of the medina. Thank you to all the staff who worked hard to make our stay enjoyable.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Katylyn87
Barcelo Palmeraie,stacey w wrote a review Jul 2022,40,Welcoming Hotel,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and our first trip to Morocco ; we were made to feel very welcome by all staff.    The grounds are beautiful and kept very clean. If you can make use of the amazing spa that is available unfortunately we were only there for 4 nights otherwise we would have used it. Love the smell of the Orange Blossom in the reception and lounge area. The pools are clean with plenty of sunbeds towels and loungers.    The hotel is modern with some interesting art. The rooms were adequate some bits could do with a bit of a touch up (which is why we have not given 5 stars) but had everything that we needed including toiletries.    The food is in abundance and you could never go hungry that is for sure. There is always a different variation of food to eat.    The hotel was very quiet when we were there but the entertainment staff did their best to keep guests occupied we are particularly grateful to Reda. He is a great member of the team.    The only thing we were missing was atmosphere but that was just through being quiet in the evenings.    We thank all for our enjoyable stay  this was delayed due to Covid for 2 years so we were happy to get to the hotel at last.,Date of stay: June 2022,,"Kent, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StaceyW905

Such a welcoming place from the minute you step into reception. Plenty of choice in the restaurants staff friendly and accommodating. The spa is on the next level. Set in beautiful grounds away from the hussle and bustle of town. Spotless everywhere. Nice rooms. If it’s a lively place ur looking for them maybe not for you but if you want peace and tranquillity excellent food and the best service then give it a try.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Couzzy
Barcelo Palmeraie,Michele P wrote a review Sep 2022,30,Mini Trip,Initial appearance very clean modern hotel. Staff are lovely and very helpful.  Negative points: Food repetitive we stayed 4 nights and that was enough. Rooms: 3 couples in our group one couple was issued a room for a disabled person! Unfortunately I was not aware to get this changed till our second day realising when they said their sink was so low to the floor and I went to have a look and realised what this room was for but too late to change as we were only staying for 4 nights not worth the hassle. One room was OK and our room well needs a little TLC plus the patio doors did not lock. I complained 3 times and was told this would be fixed or we would be moved.... this never happened and I gave up as more hassle and again as we were only there 4 nights just wanted to enjoy our stay.  I do not consider myself to be a fussy person and accept you are in a different country that has different standards so I leave you all to make your own conclusions but bear these comments in mind. We were out on trips each day and half board so it served its purpose for us. Would I want a week stay here sorry to say no.  The pool area is lovely and no worries with getting a sunbed plus you get towels.  Maid service was good. Clean towels every day and beds made and turned down in the evening with a chocolate on your pillow lovely touch.  We went with 2 other couples to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary which I did email to let them know. Thought we might have got an added extra by mentioning this as some hotels are good at that we did not but then I guess we would if we had paid more.  Experience of Moroccan people absolutely lovely and changed my thoughts entirely to what I had expected.  Shuttle bus to and from the centre which is approximately 25 minutes away so very handy. Reception will also help you if you require a taxi etc and very helpful.  To sum up a lovely 4 night stay to get the experience of Morocco but the hotel did have a few disappointing issues but didn't spoil our mini break.,Date of stay: September 2022,,"Colchester, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/869michelep

Reception staff welcoming helpful and friendly on checking in. Thank you to Amine for all of your help..... even after the hairdryer disaster!    We had 2 rooms for the group both of which were clean and comfortable for the stay and the few minor discrepancies that we did have were quickly resolved by the staff (safe and fridge not functioning) fresh towels and bottled water each day when the rooms were serviced...... just don't ask for any milk for your tea 🤣    Spent all of our days around the main pool which despite being freezing was very relaxing and peaceful with a complimentary pool towel service.    The pool days were made more special by Kamal (who is so incredibly friendly with the best spoken English of all the staff) and Hajiba (she is an absolute dream) and of course the Marrakech Tasty cocktails!! 🍹 we were able to sample the crepes and the ice cream from the pool bar during our stay all of which were fabulous just disappointed that I didn't discover the lemon sorbet until the last day!    The food..... oh my the food!!! 😍    Every single sitting for food was exceptional. A huge selection of dishes so much to choose from you just had to have a little of everything. There is absolutely no way anyone is going hungry everything was just delicious. A massive thank you to the hardworking chefs and kitchen staff for delivering such incredible food ecru single day.  We booked the all inclusive basis and it was more than worth it.  Breakfast lunch and dinner were all amazing and a huge thank you to Kamal and Khadija for making us feel very welcome always smiling and always remembering what we drink!!    The grounds of the hotel are exceptional everything is so neat and tidy and very well maintained the grounds staff work tirelessly all day. We were not bothered by any bugs or wildlife at all during our stay. There is some incredible artwork in and around the hotel with some fantastic sculptures too you don't notice it all at first so make sure you go looking it's worth it!    We were fortunate enough to stay during International Women's Day and the hotel went above and beyond to make it such a special occasion. Each female guest was given fresh roses and the whole hotel treated to an all fresco lunch with live music and the most incredible and emotional atmosphere I've never known a hotel to do anything like that before.... well done BP!!    A big thank you to Maha she goes above and beyond to ensure all guests are happy and is a consistent face around the hotel grounds and the restaurants.

The reception team has kindly changed us to a better room. Breakfast has lot of choices yet when walking to the restaurant around 10 it's unlikely to find a clean and ready set table which you need to  Wait till someone clear and set the table for us. Dinner buffet it's quite pricey 300DRS per person with not much of choice if you go little late.  We spent our day by the pool where the pool guy is very nice funny and polite  yet the bar service has luck for quality of the beverages provided. Fresh juices orders with the glass nearly half empty.  Rooms are quite nice yet the mini bar fridge is not working at all. After all I am very disappointed not sure of to recommend this hotel at all.

Barcelo Palmeraie,Traveler729149 wrote a review Nov 2021,30,Okay but definitely not 5*,This hotel was okay. Upon check in found the reception area to be dark gloomy and appeared half the area was closed .. the rooms are okay clean and airy. Good air con but no bath tub in any of the rooms .. the Rooms are surrounded by vast amounts of huge aloe plants everywhere which were mostly dead and brown and pretty depressing to be honest. There is one main restaurant which was also gloomy and dark everyone is made to wear a mask when entering the restaurant and to keep it in when getting food the buffet was minimal but good quality and tasty .. the desserts and breakfast was constantly the same things and no good dessert options for children..some jelly and ice cream options would be nice.    The pool areas were okay pool guys were nice and friendly. The snack bar is closed after like 4 it 5pm and aparently they don't give ice cream until 3pm which was so annoying for our little boy and I can't even understand why this is a rule esp as its supposed to be all inclusive.. we were told if we wanted before 3pm we had to buy..    Most of the staff in the restaurants and snack bar were miserable  not very friendly but jus did their job and that was that .. didn't give off a 5* welcome vibe if you know what I mean.    The kids pool is good and well located. The kids zone is decent with nice outdoor farm  play equipment and indoor activities. We payed for them to keep our 3yr old for a few afternoons which was nice for us and he enjoyed.    We were very disappointed by the fact that we had to pay for each time we wanted to use the sauna/jacuzzi each day most other 5* resorts usualy give free access to guests.    Massage treatments were nice and staff at the spa were friendly.    All in all I would say it was okay. Nothing amazing and over all didn't have a 5* feel to it. The 9pm curfews didn't help at all as it meant no food or drinks available after 9pm so we often had to force ourselves to eat dinner when not ready so that we wouldn't feel hungry later.,Date of stay: September 2021,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveler729149

The rooms are not a 5* rooms. 30 ml bottle of water offered by 24H. per person. Food is average but too expensive (FRUIT SALAD 120 dhs...).

Reception area gave the appearance of a grand hotel but past this it was in need of a desperate facelift to even make it a reasonable 3*    Room was clean but patio door was broke on arrival this was fixed very quickly.  Food was awful and served luke warm no entertainment and miles from anywhere  Kids often in the adult pool where we had to request staff to remove.    Saying this it was the staff who make this hotel enjoyable Kamal top guy the buggy guys 100% the guy who ran the free shuttle bus waiting staff and reception staff kitchen staff and spa staff are bang on and a great asset to this dated hotel.,Date of stay: September 2021,,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/714christiane

Now when it comes to the food there is a great deal of improvement to make. We (my kids and I + another family friends) made it to Barcelo for the experience we are used to and the great food.

I've stayed in many places in marrakesh but this place seems to be the one I am drawn to time and time again. The staff really make this place special.

Barcelo Palmeraie,JLKB wrote a review Mar 2020,50,Fantastic,The value of ‘all inclusive’ is very good. The food quality and diversity is fantastic. Top marks to the head chef who seems to be always present at the buffet station chatting to guests and keeping an eye on the operation. He is also very personable and funny!! The hotel is spread across beautifully landscaped and meticulous grounds with manicured lawn pruned olive bushes lavender roses and an array of palms. They have a kitchen garden as well with lots of herbs. It is very clean especially the pool and areas around it are kept to very high standards. All of the staff are very friendly and genuinely pleased to provide you an excellent service. Our room was also very clean and well appointed and a reasonable size.

Barcelo Palmeraie,annmac_10 wrote a review Mar 2020,40,Good holiday,"We booked this hotel All Inclusive so our comments will reflect this. I have mostly good reviews but there were some things that were not so good. First the good. The room was quite large huge bed good storage spaces for clothes big tv big shower good quality bedding and towels. The staff were all polite and helpful. The gardens were beautiful. The pool was big and there were lots of sunbeds and clean pool towels every day. There was one pool bar and one indoor bar. One main dining area. There is also a free shuttle bus that takes you into town. But remember to book this at reception. Now some not so good. The balcony only had two heavy metal chairs and a small round table. Who wants to sit on them. Also our balcony did not get the sun at any point in the day. Again what is the point. There was a kettle but it was hit and miss as to what you got regarding coffee and tea sachets. Sometime none and there was never any little pods of milk. So again what is the point of providing this. There was a ""ZEN Pool"" that only had juice but even All Inclusive guests had to pay for the juice. There was another restaurant apart from the main dining area. Again you had to pay. One day we wanted to have a snack at the pool at lunch time rather than go to the dining hall. But we were told that All Inclusive guests must use the dining hall at lunch time or pay if we wanted a snack at the pool at lunch time. These were just a few little things but most importantly I will say that they did not spoil our holiday. We very much enjoyed being at the hotel and in Marrakesh.",Date of stay: February 2020,,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annmac_10
Barcelo Palmeraie,Nikki S wrote a review Mar 2020,30,Extortionate Bar prices ruins the experience.,We are currently staying at this property and whilst the hotel is very nice clean and comfortable we are staggered that on half-board you don’t even get water included with your meal.    Unless you are all-inclusive we would suggest you think very carefully about staying here when they are charging 30D For a bottle of water with your meal and an extortionate 50D for a 50cl bottle of Evian at the pool bar. The hotel is quite a way out so there is nowhere to walk to buy supplies however 2 km from the property is a hypermarket and there are taxis that sit in the road outside the hotel. There is also a carrefour outside the medina which we ventured to and for 90D we got all the Supplies in the photo including water at 3D for 1.5 L    It is a real shame because it leaves a bad taste in the mouth - they are exploiting their half-board guests and their markup is ridiculous. Surely it would be better to charge a reasonable amount for drinks and they would sell more rather than making such a profit that guests have to bring their own drinks in.    Stock up at the airport for alcohol or if you have a private transfer get the driver to stop off at the supermarket on your way to the hotel.    Additionally if you travel with voyage prive you are told you get a free hamman and massage where in fact it isn’t a full hamman it is just a steam room.    There is a shuttle bus that takes you into the Medina but the reception staff fail to tell you you need to book it in advance otherwise you can’t get on and if you want a taxi back from the Medina rather than waiting for the bus barter (we started at 200D & got it down to 80D)    This is the second time I have visited Morocco and I have to say my first experience was far better in every aspect.,Date of stay: March 2020,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"St Ives, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loobylooCambs
Barcelo Palmeraie,Relz L wrote a review Feb 2020,30,King size room,The hotel itself to look at is beautiful from the outside to the insides. It’s well kept. They have three pools (children’s pool and zen pool) with a pond & paddling boats. The variety of food is good. Dinners are definitely never really the same. Staff from reception to cleaners are all so welcoming & friendly All greet you. My only cons are the amount of stray cats just hanging around while you eat & all so the seating area in the room. It was quite hard to get comfortable. If you choice to go to Morocco in the winter season and stay here be prepared to be chilly but the rooms are provided with great heating facilities. An my last con is it’s very far from everything. So either be prepared to take a taxi everywhere or getting the free shuttle they provide you with to & from the Médina. They have a shop a little boutique & children facilities. A bar with inside & outside seating area where you can also do hookah for a fair price.,Date of stay: February 2020,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/relzl

Barcelo Palmeraie,Pinkfizz31 wrote a review Feb 2020,30,Lovely grounds and good value,We were not sure what to expect from this hotel as we booked very late and the price was very good compared to other hotels.  Location was great easy to get into medina and free shuttle bus at good times.  Away from hustle and bustle and very peaceful.  There isn’t much to do nearby but taxis were reasonable.  The grounds were kept very well and there was a lot of space so felt very relaxed and not at all crowded.  The room was basic but clean and comfortable. A bit small if longer that a few days not much storage space. Hairdryer was appalling no point even trying to dry my hair.  The bar area also nice and we enjoyed both pools. Especially healthy drinks at the Zen bar.    Things that could be improved are: service in restaurants was always slow. Friendly but awfully slow.  Quality of food could be better. Lacked a bit of flavour we tried the meze restaurant and this was quite bland but a nice local wine list. Breakfast could be more relaxing and a better setting tables not cleared and it felt a little dirty everywhere.  The gym is not a gym but a room which was crowded with 3 people the treadmill was broken and has been since November according to other reviews. Equipment was lacking and no space at all.  I enquired at the spa and both my requests weren’t possible so didn’t get to make us of this.    All in all we enjoyed our break but some fundamentals let the hotel down. Staff were all very good and helpful however.,Date of stay: February 2020,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pinkfizz31

Very calm and silent neighborhood to escape from the busy city center.  Excellent bed well-equipped bathroom good lighting in the room.  Good free shuttle service to the city center always on time very reliable and flexible.  The staff are very friendly and helpful. Waiter Rachid is the best!  Good food wide range of food choices.

Barcelo Palmeraie,Sinead M wrote a review Jan 2020,10,If you have a complaint if falls on deaf ears - BEWARE,My family and I were very excited to be visiting Marrakech after Christmas and had chosen our hotel carefully. It was our first family reunion in over 2 years with our children so a special time. On the last day there was an incident involving a young member of their staff with one of our family. It was very uncomfortable and very upsetting. I have since written to the HOTEL 3 times and the Barcelo Head office Customer services 4 Times and called their customer service centre 3 times. NOT once has anyone contacted us for further information regarding a very uncomfortable encounter with a male member of staff. I would have thought given the circumstances and being a family hotel that they would very much be interested in our story. All I had asked was that they meet with their male staff to educate them on what was appropriate behaviour with their clientele. ALAS it is with a reluctance I write this review as it was only one member of staff whilst the others were so nice. I would definitely not be returning to this hotel with any members of our family. WE have travelled extensively and have never encountered any problems before our vacation at the Barcelo Palmeraie. What is most disappointing is the complete lack of interest from the General Manager of the Barcelo Palmeraie hotel after SEVENTEEN days or head office on this occasion. After all we are not talking about a bad breakfast but an entirely inappropriate incident with a male member of staff. Very disappointing from a 5 star hotel...very disappointing indeed.,Date of stay: December 2019,,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sinead-McA

The grounds are impeccable every staff acknowledged us and the food was amazing. We had a problem with the room safe and within minutes if our call the repairman came and fixed it. We chose the all inclusive plan and we found the food pleasing every day. There was a conference while we were there yet we received the same excellent service. A special 'merci' to Yasmine D.

Pool was cold but I read this on a review before booking so was prepared (surely its just a case of turning up the thermostat?). Service in main restaurant is seriously disorganised (you may be waiting a while for your drinks) but waiters really try to go out their way to do their best. I would definitely return. Great hotel for family and couples and loners too.

Barcelo Palmeraie,catherine b wrote a review Mar 2019,30,Recent trip,Nice hotel and lovely staff but had some problems as a room with a decent view is not shown on their website and was told only available on checking in which we managed to do after a couple of days and paid a supplement just for the view - also All Inclusive package was a bit strange as not explained very well on arrival and they did not have any bands and put some drinks which we took on our bill and also they ran out of beer and wine at the swimming pool bar on our last day and charged you for drinks at the adults pool - also after joining Barcelo loyalty programme which advertised a welcome gift and a voucher for some money to spend at the hotel was not given and when brought up with the Reception manager was told they had no idea of it. We did enjoy the sunshine but still a little undecided weather we would go back to this hotel on our next visit to Marrakech.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Brighton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catherinebN7090CV
Barcelo Palmeraie,Relax378881 wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Superb for family,Wonderful resort for family I would rate the resort as a good 4 star with everything you could need to keep young kids entertained. Plenty of family friendly food under the all-inclusive plan.

Barcelo Palmeraie,Discover53058992525 wrote a review Mar 2019,40,Good location. Friendly staff,Well if I have to be honest although it was a lovely hotel the reception and new bar etc were very nice I wouldn’t say it was a 5 star hotel compared to other places and rooms I have stayed in. However the more i stayed at this hotel the more I really liked it and enjoyed it.  Our room didn’t have the best view like the pictures online from the room window. The fridge wasn’t working in the room however I didn’t tell the reception they probably would have changed it I just didn’t say anything ( my fault) The location is good and away from the hustle and bustle however it also meant that being in the complete middle of no where that there was no shops for snacks/drinks etc so had to buy everything at the hotel. A large bottle of water outside the hotel was 5 Moroccan dirums but in the hotel is was 30.    Good Points  -Weather  Location  Free shuttle bus to the city center  Pools  Gym  Spa ( although it seemed quite pricy)    Not so good  No drink menus available  No shops nearby or snack shops on site  Fridge in room not working,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Discover53058992525
Barcelo Palmeraie,Calum W wrote a review Jan 2019,50,Fantastic Weekend,My partner and I stayed here with friends in December for a long weekend and had a fantastic time.    Rooms were very clean modern and had an outdoor seating area.    We opted for All-Inclusive and ate in the buffet restaurant every night. Staff were very friendly in the restaurant and an excellent choice of food. There was always plenty of traditional Moroccan food to choose from as well as international options.    The bar area at night was very pleasant Nadia the waitress was especially helpful. She would also give you service with a smile and would try and build rapport with you over the duration of your stay.    The hotel grounds were very well-kept and there were golf buggys to take you around.    My only grumble was that the all-inclusive option did not include the a la Carte restaurants.    Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay the Pullman and would highly recommend to those visiting Marrakech. We would certainly return. Thanks Pullman!,,,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/195calumw
