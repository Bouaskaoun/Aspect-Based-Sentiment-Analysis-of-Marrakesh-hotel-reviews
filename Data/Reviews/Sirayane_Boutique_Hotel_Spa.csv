Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,David C wrote a review Mar 13,50,"Amazing Hotel, City and People",Romantic break required to recharge batteries. We picked Marrakesh and this amazing  Hotel to try and do the Job to say both exceeded our expectations is an understatement the weather was a constant 30+ degrees the City is amazing the people very friendly and the Hotel!!! Amazing!! the staff service and Hotel suite were top notch. We had a garden suit with private pool and we never wanted to leave. Myself and my partner have traveled to many destinations around the world and I have never felt so sad to leave a place and head home as I have today. Would recommend 100% it is a little outside the medina but the peace and quite from the craziness that is Marrakesh Medina was a fantastic and welcome contrast for getting the best of both worldswould highly recommend getting to Nomad for the call to prayer and the sunset as well as Kabana and the souks are amazing. Great break amazing Hotel just what the doctor ordered to get a break from the grind and fall in love with romance once more. Thank you so so much Sirayane for a great stay 5*+,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A2535KMdavidc
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,andriabalboa wrote a review Mar 13,50,Perfection from start to finish,Stayed in suite 122 with a private pool heaven on earth. It is a good 20 mins from the medina but the hotel provides a shuttle. This hotel is so peaceful and tranquil and the perfect escape from the crazy medina best of both worlds. The staff are amazing and so helpful. Truly been the perfect long weekend.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,spearce53 wrote a review Mar 12,50,Beautiful Boutique Hotel,Stayed at The Sirayane Feb 19 - 25. We were looking for a quiet hotel away from the hectic medina and we certainly found it here. It is a wonderfully quiet oasis. The staff are amazing and go out of their way to make your stay better. The food is fantastic. We only booked for B&B but had 3 or 4 dinners and several lunches at the hotel. I have to say that I enjoyed the simplicity of the lunch menu more than the dinner menu so I asked the waiter at dinner if I could get something from the lunch menu and he was only too happy to oblige.  We enjoyed the swimming pools especially the adult only heated pool.  The shuttle service into the Medina was great especially since it‚Äôs free.  The hotel itself is beautiful decorated. I loved the library area and the sitting area with a roaring fire for the colder evenings.  We would definitely return to this hotel when we visit Marrakech again.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Poole, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spearce53
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,L Cram wrote a review Mar 5,50,amazing oasis - top class service,We stayed at the Sirayane Hotel for 7 nights in February. We were blown away by every aspect of the hotel ‚Äì the thoughtfulness of the staff the room facilities and garden the stylish public spaces the incredible food the quality of the service and the spa offerings were all outstanding. The hotel provides a genuine oasis of calm which is so welcome after a day in the sensory explosion that is Marrakech. The shuttle bus was regular and completely reliable. The helpful and friendly driver makes the very short trip pleasant and informative. This free service made trips into the hustle and bustle of Marrakech ‚Äì to the souks and for sight-seeing - easy and fun. It was also great to know that you were coming back to such serenity in the hotel at the end of the day. The pools are both beautiful and well-serviced with day-beds and fresh towels. Neither were ever too busy and the heated adults-only pool is a nice touch. We took a day-trip trip to the Ourika Valley in the Atlas Mountains with a terrific trekking guide ‚Äì an experience not to be missed. The hotel spa package ‚Äì with hammam scrub and massage was another beautiful experience - we floated out of the spa and my skin was still baby soft days later. The hotel organised a taxi at a small charge to meet us at the airport and take us back. It is a short and easy journey. A huge shout out to the food and beverages manager the chefs and the waiters at the Sirayane. All the food was delicious (we were half board) but I am gluten intolerant which can be a real pain when travelling and is hard work for those catering. From the very first moment of our arrival ‚Äì every waiter knew that my room number meant gluten free. I never had to remind staff and every day I was presented with freshly made gluten free treats. At breakfast a waiter would arrive with a platter of new delights specially made for me. At main meals I had no problem selecting from the many naturally gluten free offerings was warned when things were not suitable and always was provided with my own warm fresh gluten free bread. I cannot say how much I appreciated all of this. We would have loved this hotel anyway ‚Äì but really the way that the staff went above and beyond without making me feel like I was difficult was hugely appreciated. We have already recommended this hotel to others and could not rate it more highly. Do yourself a favour and make this your next escape.,Date of stay: February 2023,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lcram123

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Lee wrote a review Feb 2023,30,Our Stay,Not really what we would consider a 5 star by UK US and Caribbean standards. They do try to be helpful and are polite although NO all inclusive here and the best you can expect is Half Board rubbish really. The half board is breakfast and evening meal only and NO drinks. You can't swap lunch for evening meal you just get charged we did. So if your out or don't fancy the same menu again it's tough. The menu is very limited especially for a 5 star which makes meal times boring same little uninteresting eating area and small menu every day is quite tedious. The rooms we had a premium room with pool is worn and tired with lots of little bits of general maintenance required and the same goes for the hotel and the spa (staff in spa texting whilst giving massages not great!) However the staff are polite and try to be helpful the shuttle service is OK but limited by the set times you can use it. We wouldn't go here again better hotels are in Marrakech just not available via Tui who are rubbish.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leedC7146TK

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Paulboyblue wrote a review Jan 2023,40,"Nice place, great staff but is this what you're looking for?",Lovely hotel with clean spacious room nice little garden three pools - two of which were heated and lovely staff. Helpful smiling and there when you want them. Place felt safe and secure. Lovely food; especially lunch and dinner. Buffet breakfast has wide choice but apart from omlette quiche and hot vegetables there were few hot options. A great stay if you want seclusion and a relaxing stay. Down side? As with most of Marrakesh the main concept is to rinse you for as much money as possible. Can of cola ¬£2.50 bottle of beer ¬£8 cocktails awful and had incorrect ingredients (pina colada made with tequilla?)! Nowhere to walk to locally so bring nibbles biscuits mixers and alcohol into room with you. In addition to the regular free transport into the Medina a cab into Marrakech about ¬£20 one way. Hamam quite nice; start at around ¬£40 for 30 minutes - each.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,olddoris wrote a review Jan 2023,50,A slice of oasis,We had the most beautiful 7 nights at the sirayane.  Everyone was so friendly approachable and very professional. We spoke to the deputy manager who came to regularly check everything was well. They kindly gave us two glasses of champagne and cocktails for my 30th birthday. Plenty of security guards around to make you feel safe. We only visited the centre of marrakesh once as the resort was so lovely. The hammam and spa was also incredible. We were half board and the breakfast and dinner was exceptional and although we arrived quite late they managed to send a 3 course dinner via room service. A proper 5 star hotel with amazing hospitality through and through which made our stay very enjoyable.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,kathybtravels wrote a review Jan 2023,40,"Pleasant stay, minor discomforts",We stayed at Sirayane for 3 nights. The hotel and grounds are a lovely balance of modern with a Moroccan charm. Food was good cocktails could be improved in taste and alcohol content but were beautifully presented. I especially loved all the deserts very high quality and delicious. The grounds were lovely and relaxing but there are few mosquitos and I found the pool beds/ loungers not so comfortable for me however all the staff at the hotel restaurant were lovely polite and always helpful with prompt service. Breakfast was plentiful and tasty with many options. Overall a pleasant stay. My only negatives are that there was no view from our room ( our patio looked out onto ac units on the rooftop and some potted plants) the beds were also very hard and uncomfortable. I did not sleep well one single night and pillows were overstuffed and uncomfortable as well so my quality of sleep was very poor over the course of my stay. Supply of water to the room daily was also an issue as they waited until late at night (between 8-10pm) to deliver? Not sure why.,Date of stay: December 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Crown Point, Tobago",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathybtravels

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,24Cox wrote a review Nov 2022,50,5‚≠êÔ∏èCustomer Service,I read the reviews before booking this hotel and I have just read them again on arrival home and I agree with most of the comments. I think welcoming staff going the extra mile putting the customer first stands out in this hotel. We were given a tour of the facilities on arrival and the staff seemed to know who we were and rarely had to ask for our room number. After a great selection at self service breakfast we sometimes enjoyed playing paddle tennis even though most of the balls ended up in the bushes or in the desert. After a morning sightseeing tour it was always nice to get back to the hotel to relax and swim in the quiet adult pool.  Good security in evidence at night too.  The proud owner also welcomed us on arrival asked if we were enjoying ourselves during our stay and came to bid us farewell on leaving after a lovely week spent in this delightful hotel and gardens‚Ä¶,Date of stay: November 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CW4848
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Jonathan H wrote a review Nov 2022,50,"Peace , Tranquillity and Great Customer Service at the Sirayane",A luxury boutique peaceful hotel in it's own grounds but within 15 minutes of the hustle and bustle of Old Town Marrakech. From the initial greeting at reception through to the wonderful team there to look after every guest this hotel is a real gem for those looking for the personal touch.  The hotel is close to many of the top golf courses so is a great base and also only 15 minutes taxi from the town and airport.  Anas the food and beverage manager is just amazing and even took a specific order for our chosen dish one night.  Both food and drinks are all very reasonable.  We liked the spacing of the sun loungers and the general space in the resort despite it only having c 50 rooms.  We had a lovely week in perfect weather of 25-30 degrees in early November.  Table tennis pool and table football all available as is a lovely spa on site.  On our last day they did everything they could to accommodate our late check out without any of the usual fuss of many hotels - just another example of how customer centric they are.  Top tip - there is additional wines on the 'french' menu although we were very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the local Moroccan wines.  This was one resort we really didn't want to leave.,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B9922MBjonathanh

Since returning to the UK yesterday I have recommended this hotel to my friends and family and would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a beautiful getaway!

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Rlamb wrote a review Nov 2022,50,A peaceful escape with exceptional gardens,We were very impressed with the warmth we were greeted with by our driver Abdulali who waited for us for 3 hours (because of a delay at passport control.) The transfer was very smooth and he was very friendly and knowledgeable- great guy! Excellent hotel with exceptionally hard working gardeners - a tranquil escape from the hustle and bustle of the Medina. Reliable shuttle service into the centre on a regular basis makes it easy to sight see if this is wanted (15-20mins each way). The hotel is clean rooms lovely and staff are very attentive. The restaurant food is good but additional options would be appreciated. The lunch and dinner menu could be tweaked slightly with additional options for vegetarians. I had a slight issue with our meal on the last night but the general manager quickly rectified it the solution was swift and the manager handled the situation well. On arrival my husband realised he'd left his razor at home he mentioned it to the gentleman on the front desk and he sent a shaving kit to our room within half an hour. Lastly the beautiful cat at the hotel made our day. All round I would have no hesitation to recommend to friends and family and plan to return again next year.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Maidenhead, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rlambish

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Jaz H wrote a review Sep 2022,40,An excellent small hotel on the outskirts of Marrakech,A wonderful hotel - we stayed with a baby for 7 nights (2 adults a 7-month baby) half-board.    The staff are just great - and they were very pleasant and nice to us and in particularly our baby - thank you. The conciergerie is very helpful too.    The hotel has some wonderful spacious rooms we got an upgrade to a room with a private garden right near the pool - excellent. Each room has wifi and a good size smart TV. It's well furnished and modern.    The hotel grounds are well designed with 3 pools (1 adult 1 large 1 smaller heated). It was never too busy very clean and always had staff at hand. Very relaxing. The temperature was good for a baby to swim. The hotel provides floats for children/babies. There are many lounges and seating areas as well as a games room. The hotel is very peaceful and quiet!    Location: hotel is on the outskirts of the city. There is nothing walkable nearby (so no restaurants etc). It's about 20 mins drive from the airport and Medina. There is a regular bookable free shuttle taxi to Medina (now available till about midnight). If you want to go elsewhere you can book a private taxi or get one from the Medina. We did excursions through the hotel and these were good!    The spa-hammam was great. We made use of this and the massage was excellent. They were able to fit us in at short notice too!    This is nearly a 5-star hotel - there are some things that would make it better. Room service is done daily but it's not the best - i.e. sometimes they would forget to give a new glass/cup or toilet roll not replenishing milk or tea and even 1 towel short once! Concierge would always rectify this if told. Room service would make the bed but sometimes they tidy up and wipe surfaces sometimes they don't! It's inconsistent.    The restaurant and bar staff are wonderful and very accommodating - some of the best service I've seen. Half-board is operated as breakfast and either lunch or dinner (which is 3 courses). The tagines and the main courses for dinner are excellent. However I would suggest that the menus be revisited - there aren't enough veggie/vegan options for a 7-night half-board stay. The menu is not changed and there does not seem to be any 'Option of the day'. The lunch is not as good as dinner (especially the sandwiches - which are very average). Compared with European or Asian luxury hotels - the breakfast could also be better but it has many sweet options.    Overall - I would highly recommend this hotel and visit it again in the future.,Date of stay: September 2022,,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jazhayre

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,jamestpendletom wrote a review Aug 2022,40,Superb hotel with great service!!,We stayed at this wonderful hotel in Marrakech for 3 nights with family (3 Adults and 2 children).    We arrived on a Friday evening and were quickly checked in and all relevant information was given. We were offered cold drinks and Turkish tea whilst we waited.    Rooms were a good size  very clean and amply stocked as you'd expect a five star hotel to be... bathrobes slippers condiments etc.. Strong WiFi in rooms and around the hotel including the pool area.    There are two pools for general use and an adult salt water pool. Both very relaxing and enjoyable.    Food at the hotel was excellent having both an international and local menu. Breakfast had good variety of items and eggs were available on request.  Regular shuttlebus service is available to take you into Jemaa el-Fnaa  and bring you back as well. Just needs to be booked 1 hour in advance.    The best thing about the hotel s the excellent service and the quiet serene calmness all round making it a very enjoyable stay. We would definitely visit and stay again:    So why not 5 Stars? ‚Äì just a few minor points:  - Quite a few mosquitoes in the rooms we had although we didn‚Äôt get bitten .. so maybe well trained mosquitoes üòä  - No flexibility on shuttle service when we called to book an earlier pick-up (30mins before timeslot)  the answer was a straight ‚Äúsorry need to book an hour in advance‚Äù there was no other option given. Given this is a five star I would have expected the service go the extra mile.  - location is quite out of the way and far from Marrakeck centre.,Date of stay: August 2022,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamestpendletom

The pool in our room was heated which was amazing.  The was a shuttle service to the main city centre and it has so many different times that it comes and goes. So very practical and useful.  We used the spa and the services were outstanding.  We had half board and the half board menu is really good. For the other times when we paid for meals they are so reasonably priced that we were surprised at how low are bill was at check out.  I honestly cannot find on thing to complain about. We will be coming back again and again. I have to say the staff honesty make this hotel something so special.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Gabbie R wrote a review Jul 2022,50,We never wanted to leave!,My boyfriend and I have just returned from a 10 day stay at the Sirayane Hotel and we are absolutely bereft. We had the most wonderful time here for a variety of reasons and were so upset that we had to leave. This is by far the best hotel I have ever been to due to the excellent customer service lovely food and just the complete and utter relaxation I felt throughout my stay.    I read through many of the reviews before coming so already had high expectations of the service we were to receive. Everyone at the hotel exceeded my expectations with their level of service. The waiters at the restaurant or in the bar made you feel like there was nothing too much to ask for and were attentive and personable. There were so many little extra touches to their service which didn't go unnoticed. The staff in the spa were also amazing- I took advantage of the spa at a hotel for the first time ever and had an amazing manicure and pedicure. On our last day as we had been in the pool prior to our departure we were allowed to use the spa facilities to shower and dress before we left and the staff member there even dried my bikini and damp clothes and then put them in a plastic bag for me to take home which was amazing.    The food was delicious- the desserts were such a treat and the dishes we tried were so nice and very reasonably priced. The cocktails were also amazing and there is a real variety to choose from. They're also much more reasonably priced than anything you might find in central Marrakech.    The shuttle bus service is regular reliable and an excellent opportunity to explore the Medina. We either got the 5pm or 7.30 into Marrakech and the 11.15pm return bus depending on how much time we needed in the city and always found that was ample time for us. We were happy with the option of staying in for a more chilled out evening at the hotel or going to the Medina for a bit of a livelier night.    The excursions we went on that were organised by the staff at the reception were great. They sorted out a dinner in the Agafay desert for us which was so fun and our favourite excursion of the holiday.    As I said we have had the best 10 days and truly wish we could go back. I would totally recommend this to anybody young or old. We are in our late 20s and although this was quieter than our usual holiday we found the peace and quiet was perfect for us this time and we could mix it up enough with regular visits to Marrakech.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Tiffanypurple wrote a review Jul 2022,40,Great place to escape and unwind in Marrakech,The hotel was beautifully executed stunning grounds. The rooms are really lovely. You can tell they take great pride in customer service and ensuring everyone has an enjoyable stay. Only 15 minutes drive from the airport too.    I chose the Sirayane as I have visited Marrakech before so was less concerned about visiting the sights and more wanted a place I could relax and unwind. Given it was July and the weather was over 40oc - I wanted a nice big pool and an air conditioned gym - and it provided well on both counts. As a solo traveller I particularly enjoyed the peace and quiet of the adult only pool.    I also made use of the shuttle bus to and from the Medina a couple of times. When I did try and get a taxi back one day I had real trouble as many didn't want to travel that far outside of Marrakesh. I had to pay more to get them to take me. Worth noting.    If this is your first time in the city and you want a hotel as a base to explore the Medina personally I would get somewhere a little closer to town. But if you want somewhere to escape to and relax and unwind then this is definitely the right hotel.    The food was so so. Reasonable priced and portion sizes were generous. Waiters were lovely although getting the food often took a long time. Breakfast was a bit hit or miss. Sometimes the baked goods were fresh other times they tasted rather stale and dry. Dinner - the Moroccan food tasted better than the International menu (in my opinion) and the paninis at lunch were lacking flavour.    The staff were very professional and courteous at all times. They were constantly maintaining the property and nothing was too much effort. I would have loved to have seen more females front of house in reception or waiting tables. It was rather male dominated and whilst they were all very polite it would have been nice to have a more female warmer approach at times.    All in all - if you are looking for someone to relax and unwind recharge the batteries then you will be very happy here.,Date of stay: July 2022,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tiffanypurple

It was made such an amazing experience because this hotel was perfect for us. Close to the airport (20 minutes transfer) serene stylish and the staff provide incredible service. This was all at a great rate for our package as well. We even extended our stay as it was so beautiful.    We met the owner he was a great guy and most welcoming and his team are incredibly attentive and provide a fantastic service all round. The spa treatments helped add to the relaxation and the room we had was beautiful (Mini-suite with garden).

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,The Oxfordshire Reviewer wrote a review Jun 2022,40,A very hospitable stay,We had a lovely stay at the end of May/beginning of June.    After an awful flight experience with TUI we arrived to a calm sanctuary at midnight. Unfortunately we missed dinner but were told we could have lunch on our last day instead which was great.    We had a very enjoyable stay. We were greeted every morning for breakfast and in the evening for dinner by the same staff who made us feel most welcome and also remembered our usual drink orders and special orders for breakfast from the kitchen.    There is a great variety of food available from the buffet breakfast. Cheeses ham pastries yoghurts fresh fruits toast/bread and warm veg and some meats on the far left side. The cold and hot drinks are self-service. The fresh juices are in jugs and there is a self service coffee machine for coffees/lattes/mochas etc... and a kettle for teas.    You can also order freshly prepared dishes from the kitchen such as fried eggs omelettes with a choice of cheese ham mushroom and spinach filings and Moroccan pancakes.    Dinners were also great and everything in the evening was table service. It would have been great with a wider variety of choice perhaps too - for example there was a lovely lamb and prune tagine dish available on the lunch menu but not on the evening menu. More choice would have been good.    A special thanks to all the restaurant staff particularly:  ‚Ä¢Zidane  ‚Ä¢Yassine  ‚Ä¢Salah Dean  ‚Ä¢Abdul  ‚Ä¢Abdul (with glasses)  ‚Ä¢Oussian    Our room was on-the-whole beautiful. We stayed in room 136 and after a kind unexpected upgrade. The bed was comfortable and the room had everything you needed.    Some suggestions for improvements for the room:    ‚Ä¢ The large water should be provided every morning during the morning clean as the two small water bottles in the evening will not last long    ‚Ä¢There was not a list of telephone numbers to dial for reception the spa or room service - this would be beneficial. I ended up writing the numbers on the paper insert on the telephone    ‚Ä¢ The TV satellites would perhaps need checking. We were unable to watch the news in the evening at the beginning of the holiday. A man seemed to fix the issue but this was only temporary. We ended up manually resetting the TV ourselves which left us with only 3 channels to choose from but it was fortunate that we could access and English speaking news channel    ‚Ä¢ Ant traps and/or ant spray in the room. We had a large outbreak of ants in the toilet which was swiftly rectified by the cleaners and a maintenance man resealing the doorframe where the ants were coming in from.    ‚Ä¢ The pool was clean and warm but it did look tired and had some tiles missing    ‚Ä¢ The walk-in shower was a lovely size however a lot of mould was growing in the grouting and needed a good bleach to remove the mould.    ‚Ä¢ The main curtains and net curtains have some rips and small holes in which made the curtains look tired.    The spa was also excellent there was a limited amount of English that could be spoken but Basty's English was good. I would advise to have a hamman at the start of your stay to exfoliate your skin before your tan! The hamman is very intimate you are only wearing a pair of disposable knickers!  I also had a massage which was great. All treatments are very reasonably priced.    On the whole our stay was very good and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. A special thanks to Anas the deputy manager. He was always visible and was always there if you had a query or issue. Thank you Anas.,Date of stay: May 2022,,"Oxfordshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AOxfordshireReviewer

Honestly cannot fault the hotel the staff or anything during our stay. The restaurant food in the evening was amazing everything we tried tasted so good. Only possible negative is that there is not any shops you can walk to if you fancied a drink/snack but to be honest everything in hotel was pretty fairly priced and there is free shuttle into the city and back all day long.

The hotel is a wonderful way of getting away from everything and makes you feel so relaxed as soon as you set foot into it.    This time we were upgraded to a Prestige room with a private terrace which was very spacious and clean with an enormous bed. Fabulous!!    The restaurant offers a buffet-style breakfast which has plenty on offer for various tastes. The restaurant also offers a range of lunchtime dishes and in the evening offers Moroccan and other cuisines.    There is a shuttle bus into the city at regular intervals during the day and a walk around the souk and the D‚Äôjemaa al fna is highly recommended. There is a bus that tours various parts of the city and is available from opposite the Koutoubia mosque in the centre of the city. The hotel also offers a range of trips which are available to book at reception.    Sadly our holiday was overshadowed by the Coronavirus pandemic which meant the situation changed quickly and led to the closure of all public places and the airport during our stay. As a result our holiday ended slightly early and we were repatriated back to the UK via Agadir airport. However once the situation has returned to where everyone is free to travel overseas again we will definitely return.    It has to be said that the staff in the hotel and on the reception desk were utterly professional and provided us with advice and reassurance during this difficult time for everyone. With all that‚Äôs going on they have to face a period where the hotel will close and they will be unable to work.

We had a pool suite for our first two nights and it was perfect for three of us..very comfortable! The rooms were extremely clean and water and Moroccan biscuits were dropped to the room every day! We then moved to a suite with a garden and the main pool was only steps away. It was great to be able to pop back to the room for anything needed. The pool area itself was very relaxed and quiet and the pool attendants knew which beds we liked and had our towels on them after our breakfast in the mornings...such a treat! The breakfast was excellent and had such a big selection. We had lunch there every day and it was lovely and the chef even prepared us starters from the evening menu for lunch..nothing was a problem! If we started wine at lunch they kept it in the fridge for dinner time. It was the little details that made the stay feel very personal.  I had a hammam and massage and it was the most relaxing experience ever...I wouldn‚Äôt leave this hotel without one of their packages....well worth every penny and the spa itself feels very luxurious.  The fire in the evenings after dinner was lovely for the cooler evenings of February!

Anus the assistant manager was a gentleman and made sure we had everything we needed including helping us with a medical issue. The others on reception were also really helpful. Mohammad Youssef and all the other restaurant staff were so helpful and friendly. Mahdi the owner of the hotel was very attentive and helpful. The free shuttle to the center was perfect.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,CJHolliday wrote a review Feb 2020,50,Great first time in Marrakech,The Sirayane Hotel was great! Out of the centre of Marrakech but not too far if you want to take advantage of the free shuttle. We had the benefit of a suite which was really spacious and had it's own private garden and pool. Two deck chairs a double lounger and a parasol so no problems catching the sun or hiding from it as you need. The room had a separate sitting area two tv's and a DVD player. A kettle coffee maker and the appropriate supplies was much appreciated as was the daily supply of Moroccan biscuits.    We ate in the restaurant several evenings choosing from the Moroccan menu and the food was excellent - in fact it spoilt us for other places. The breakfast buffet had plenty of choice but not much by way of hot food - although omelettes and poached eggs were available to order. That said there was plenty with which to fill your plate.    Apart from a few rooms in the main building over the lounge bar library and dining room the rooms are more like small apartments surrounding the main swimming pool and set in well maintained gardens.    The staff were very attentive and the management would often be around inquiring about your stay and asking if there was anything else we needed.,Date of stay: February 2020,,"Blackpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CJHolliday
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Aoife M wrote a review Feb 2020,50,Relaxing stay and wonderful staff,We were a party of three friends who stayed here for 5 nights following our adventures around Morocco in a 4X4. We stayed 2 of the nights in a suite with private pool which was really lovely. The other nights we moved into a room with private garden 35 steps from the public pool. The hotel has a lovely relaxed atmosphere and we loved its boutique size (and the open fire in the evenings!). The location was just was just what we were looking for; far enough to be secluded but only 15/20 mins on the free shuttle to the Medina. It would be useful to have an extra shuttle organized from the Medina to the hotel at some stage following sunset as there is nothing between 630pm and 10pm. We took a taxi which cost ‚Ç¨20 which was fine as a one-off. There is nothing at all close to the hotel itself so it meant we ate at the restaurant there quite a bit but the food was really good. The spa was heavenly - the best massage I‚Äôve ever had. One of our party required treatment at hospital during our stay. The hotel staff were so attentive and helpful. They organized hospital transfers free of charge and stayed with us during the night to help with translating even going out to find us food in the middle of the night. They brought us a late breakfast in our room to let us have a lie-in and then later brought complimentary drinks by the pool. This was our first visit to Morocco which surpassed all of our expectations. We hope to come back and see more of this lovely country and hopefully another stay at Sirayane some day!

It is priced fairly - do not expect pretence glitz and bling It is not 7 star! And there are 7 star equivalent hotels if you want to pay the price. It is low key and understated. Clean and spacious.    The food is good but we only ate in the restaurant one evening as there is much to see and eat in the city centre. Breakfast & lunch were good (teenage kids like burgers and club sandwiches).    The staff go out their way to make sure you have everything you require. They are very helpful and understand it is important for you to enjoy your trip to Marrakech.  The awards the hotel has received over the years are on display in the reception area.    The sun beds in the gardens are big and relaxing in spacious garden surroundings.    The rooms are comfortable and clean. Avoid putting your mobile phone next to the room key - unless of course you want to increase your step count to reception.    We had a great 6 day trip - and feel comfortable returning and recommending - Thank you to all the staff.,Date of stay: February 2020,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H212MPadama

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Mits84 wrote a review Feb 2020,40,Great views of Atlas mountains,My wife and I stayed at the Sirayane in January. The hotel is clean staff are friendly and the views of the Atlas mountains from the room we had were great. I would say the hotel is far from the Medina (around 20mins) however the shuttle bus was pretty much on time for the various time slots. One issue we experienced was that the receptionist had booked one of our return services for the wrong time but fortunately the bus had sufficient space to fit everyone. Also I think there should be more frequent shuttle buses back from the Medina to the hotel in the evenings given the limited dining options nearby so you'll need to factor this in. We also used the hotels transfer to and from the airport and this was very good; transport was clean on-time and the drivers friendly. Also the price of the service is reasonable and at a fixed rate.,Date of stay: January 2020,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mits84
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Nelima wrote a review Feb 2020,50,January Trip,3 of us girls stayed at Siryane for 6 days - room 104 and we were really impressed. Hotel is in a deserted area thus cab prices are costly but there is a shuttle service with friendly drivers i.e. Rachid who gave us lots of tips! I would suggest another evening shuttle service as shuttle timing is a tad awkward in the evening. Spa service was amazing with reasonable prices. Betsy gave me an incredible full body massage. Food at hotel was decent but staff were amazing. Abdelmoula from the bar was very kind as well as the other dining staff. Reception staff are friendly Saad booked tables for us when we struggled with language and Ibrahim helped us with a problem we had with an external company. Ibrahim also gave us a tour of hotel upon arrival which was a nice touch. 2 pools including a heated pool with helpful pool boys who knew what we wanted before even asking in the end!    As we were celebrating a birthday the hotel kindly bought cake and drinks to our room and Anas the lovely assistant manager gave us further drinks at the lounge! He also came round to say hi at breakfast which made us feel at home. There is security at the door and they also walk round the hotel even at like 4am etc so we always felt so safe.    A little uncertainty with checkout as they would not confirm our extension until last minute (only when we clarified we will be paying) so this was a downside.    Will miss Siryane and hope to visit again.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Samirah wrote a review Feb 2020,50,Highly recommend!,Stayed at Sirayane for 5 nights in the Prestige Room with Private Terrace. Room was big and spacious. The cleaning staff did a good job everyday to ensure our room was clean and equipped with towels. The view from our room was amazing as we had a clear view of the pool and in the distance was Atlas Mountains.    Breakfast was decent. The restaurant staff were very attentive. The pool staff were also very good. The staff at the reception were helpful as they were able to book tables for us at restaurants as well as sort out an issue we had with a quad bike company. They also supplied us with plug adapters for our room.    We also had lunch twice and dinner one night at the hotel and it was really good. Again the staff during lunch and dinner as well as the bar staff were very helpful and friendly.    There is a free shuttle bus from the hotel to Jemaa el-Fna that runs 7 times a day which was very convenient. As the hotel is a little out of the way I highly recommend using the shuttle bus. The driver Rachid was very helpful and friendly.    We also used the hotel spa and it was wonderful. Staff made sure we were comfortable and relaxed at all times. Highly recommend a full body massage at Sirayane.    We came to Morocco to celebrate my 21st Birthday and the hotel staff were able to make our experience memorable. They came to our room with a cake and champagne and after hearing that we don‚Äôt actually drink alcohol they quickly came back with mocktails instead. The next day the assistant manager introduced himself and said he had a birthday surprise for us and came back with more mocktails! Overall it was a lovely hotel with amazing staff who made the entire trip memorable.    If you‚Äôre looking to come to Marrakech and can‚Äôt decide on a hotel I strongly recommend Sirayane. I look forward to coming back.,Date of stay: January 2020,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hsbxo
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Flor de Naranjo wrote a review Feb 2020,50,Perfect,arrived very tired and somewhat saturated because in Madrid they stole a backpack there we had medications and toiletries (the girl at the reception took care of giving us a toothbrush and in the room there was everything necessary for the bathroom)  It was our first 'Honeymoon' and that is why we chose this establishment which we hope to repeat soon. Highlight the friendliness of the employees. Warm welcome. We liked absolutely everything about the hotel. A la carte restaurant where you can choose to eat typical dishes of the country and also a more European menu very varied food options.The hotel is about 10 minutes from downtown and a free transfer can be organized at the reception.The hotel also has a Spa maybe the prices are a bit  expensive if we compare them with other Hammams in the city I cannot give much opinion of this because we did not have time to enjoy it.The transfer from the Airport to the hotel is 220 dirham this price is the price of the reception.We booked the stay with another website since we saw a large. We are eager to repeat again and we hope it will be soon.

It was a luxurious peaceful hotel. We know that hotels when they say 5* will not necessarily be the standard we expect- however this was and more!  Staff were helpful the shuttle bus clean and regular.  The breakfast was delicious.  It was a haven after lots of trips- a fabulous place to return to at the end of a long day.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Hawitt123 wrote a review Jan 2020,50,Fantastic,Stayed here for 4 days and 3 nights on a trip away from the kids for a bit. Love them dearly but we all need a rest sometimes!    The hotel was fantastic really relaxing and the staff couldn‚Äôt do enough for us. Managed to get an upgrade and a lovely Moroccan mint tea on arrival and then it was relaxing and food all the way.    Free shuttles into the centre of Marrakech back and forth which was fantastic and after the business of the centre was great to just come back to the hotel and relax.    The breakfasts were great the lunch was lovely. We preferred to go into the centre of Marrakech for our evening meal rather than hotel but still came back to the hotel for a beer and wine later on.    Word of advice alcohol is much harder to find in Morocco but you can get it in the hotels. Beer will set you back about ¬£7 and bottle of wine about ¬£30 though. The hotel did offer a handy little thing though if you buy a bottle and give your room number over they will keep it for you and can just keep drinking it day after or whenever which saves getting more expensive individual glasses.    Anyway a fantastic time and it takes a lolly for me to write a review but this Hotel was absolutely worth it and we would certainly come again.

Our room with a private pool was just what was needed to relax and enjoy the jan sun; it‚Äôs much warmer than we expected at this time of year! The two chefs were excellent and frankly it was nice to sample an international menu as well as a local Moroccan one. The owner was very accommodating welcoming and very personable.

Hotel was also of a high standard as well as the room. Hotel was peaceful tranquil and served the purpose for why we visited.  Outdoor heated pool was great although I felt the water was still lukewarm; not warm or hot.  Room was great and no problems with the wifi.  One negative was dinner. Although my tagine was cooked well I thought it lacked taste and was very dry in comparison to superior tagines I had eaten in Marrakech for half the price! Drinks were great.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Snehal wrote a review Dec 2019,20,Disappointing,Excellent property as such - outside of the hustle and bustle that is Marrakech. The front desk was helpful for most part (bar one occasion when they made a serious error). The rooms were clean the design was good. What they seriously lacked was quality of the materials in the bathroom and ridiculously for 2 nights we had major issues with the shower. Once where we actually had the water stop on us through the shower head (which led us to use the wash basin to clean) and the second time when the water would just not stop. The plumber was absolutely incompetent and the ability of the management to provide service extremely poor. Really APPALLED! Other that that the breakfast and the dinner we had in the hotel were both wonderful. Would we recommend? with EXTREME CAUTION... would we return to this property after the bathroom fiasco? Well perhaps if the management had taken care of our problem??????,Date of stay: November 2019,,"Atlanta, Georgia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iluvsydney
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Kelebogile M wrote a review Dec 2019,40,Wonderful relaxing break - some improvements necessary,Stayed here for a full week. The hotel is great for some peace and relaxation would definitely stay here again.  Pros:  No music allowed at the swimming pool which is a bonus! The heated pool was great as the other pool was far too cold for this time of the year (end of November). There's more than enough loungers for everyone.  Breakfast was great good selection of foods  Hotel location is in the middle of nowhere so guaranteed peace and quiet  Shuttle service and transfers to the airport were great and always ran on time  Check in and check out were swift and easy  Bottles of water brought to the room every evening  Rooms are spacious  English channels on the TV in room  Pool/bar area and tennis court are a great bonus  Staff are very attentive  Food was always tasty and great selection    Cons:  Rooms could be cleaner the room was dusty when we checked in  Spa is a bit overpriced and got a polish on nails while having a pedicure which I wasn't told would cost extra. Service in spa was quite slow  We had dinner in the hotel every night can be a bit expensive with the 10% service charge.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Andrea A wrote a review Nov 2019,50,Ladies that rock the Kech!,Upon arrival early evening we were welcomed by Reception with mint tea & Morrocan biscuits. We were shown to our suite & were totally blown away with the surprise: our very own private pool. The room was set up for the 3 of us & had everything that we needed & more...Very clean bright & airy with comfortable beds including the single!  The communal pool area & gardens are well looked after & the pool boy Miloud was very attentive laying out the free hotel towels on the double sunbeds putting up the umbrella without asking & adjusting our sun bathing position to get the best of the sun! 2 pools: one was very refreshing & the other like a bath. Our own pool was in between temperatures & much fun was had practising our synchronised swimming!!  The bar & restaurant staff were very friendly & looked after us very well. We began to feel a little bit like celebs & had lovley conversations with guests (couples) from other European countries.  Mohamed (Zidane) taught us Arabic phrases which went down well not only in the hotel but in the Medina too.  Breakfast is a buffet & freshly cooked eggs can be ordered too. Plenty of choice & exceptional service. Always refreshing to sit outside & take in the pleasant ambience of the gardens with birds tweeting away in the olive trees.  We had half board so ate at the hotel for dinner. A good selection to choose from on the menu with Morrocan & other dishes available to suit everyone. Great service as always & during our stay we managed to drink the bar dry with our choice of Morrocan rose wine. The local beer Flag was our choice at lunchtime & came with olives & nuts. Cocktails are also available but not much choice-we tried but stuck with the wine/lager/water!!!!  All the staff here cannot do enough for you & it's a lovely relaxing place to chill after being in the Medina or out & about.  A fab time with many memories made to last forever.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Juliet-Photography wrote a review Nov 2019,50,An Intimate & Very Relaxing Hotel,I‚Äôve just returned from a week at Sirayanne staying in a deluxe suite with my teenage son (husband and daughter should have been with us but they were not able to travel at the last minute). :(    The hotel lives up to all the amazing reviews you‚Äôll read here. I really needed a quiet relaxed break and that‚Äôs exactly what I got. We had one of the deluxe suites with its own pool and it felt like paradise. I loved the privacy though I noticed the main pools were never busy and always quite and relaxed. I loved the grounds full of olive trees Hibiscus cactus succulents and colourful Bougainvillea. The place is so peaceful all you‚Äôll hear is beautiful bird song.    Our room was extremely spacious although to be honest my son didn‚Äôt feel terribly comfortable sleeping on a sofa so perhaps daybeds would be a better option for kids? The room however was very clean and the maids wonderful. The mini bar restocked daily water delivered late each afternoon and the room kept spotless. We had a bath with a shower a huge walk in rain water shower and 2 sinks. The air conditioning was great in fact I had to turn in down in the end as it started getting rather nippy!    We were full board and ate all our meals at the hotel. The food was fine although I expected the Moroccan food to be a little more spiced and flavoursome. We found breakfast was lovely (I ate mostly fresh pancakes and fresh fruit) lunch had plenty of options but our evening meal felt a bit limited towards the end of our stay. A ‚Äògastronomy ‚Äò menu was displayed in our room which seemed to have more options but we were always given a menu that stated ‚Äòhalf board‚Äô at the top when we ate. The staff were always friendly and said hello. They were keen to know that we were enjoying our stay and the owner also came and said hello on a few occasions.    We used the gym and the pool table  and my son also enjoyed watching the football in the sports bar. I didn‚Äôt use the spa although I asked if I could borrow a yoga/sports mat from the gym there to take to my room (as no space for yoga there) and was told no I couldn‚Äôt.    We took a trip to the M√©dina on one day with our tour operator TUI which I highly recommend. If you are feeling adventurous then take the hotel‚Äôs shuttle and make your own way around this astonishing city. We preferred an organised tour that still allowed us to see the Souks in great detail and picked us up and dropped us back at the hotel after an 8 hour day for ¬£41 each including lunch!

Thought this year that a change was needed and Marrakesh and this hotel were selected.    The hotel is a little gem in the hustle & bustle of Marrakesh. It is situated in the middle on nowhere which means you can visit the M√©dina and sites and then return to the tranquility of the hotel.    We stayed in room 110 which was spotless. The rooms are large and comfortable and there really is nothing to complain about. Being able to just stroll to the 2 pools from your garden if fantastic.    The breakfast was great. Pretty much everything you could wish for and flexible if you wanted anything else. The only suggestion I would make is that additional plates may need to be purchased as there were several occasions when I had to wait for a plate.    Didn‚Äôt eat at the hotel in the evening as was with a 6 year old child. However everyone else I spoke to said the food was great.    The waiters / pool staff / driver / reception staff are really friendly and even the owner speaks to you. This has never happened at the le Meridian.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Peter S wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Wonderful hotel - couple of things could be improved,We were booked at Sirayne for 1 night and then 4 days later coming back for 4 more nights after we‚Äôd climbed Mount Toubkal.    Check in for the first time was really slow as there was a couple arriving at the same time as us so we had to wait for them. This took around 20 mins and was a little frustrating as we just wanted to get to our room.    We were lucky to be upgraded from a garden villa to a pool villa so we had our own pool. The room was huge so this was all a nice. Only three slight negatives here. There was a bowl of complimentary fruit in our room (nice touch) but half of it was mouldy. It would have been better with no fruit that some that was mouldy. Also someone has stuck their used plaster/band aid on the swimming pool edge so that was grim. The main shower barely worked too which was a shame as it was a lovely huge shower. But it was barely a dribble and not usable.  I think a couple of more attentions to details by housekeeping and this would have been faultless. Don‚Äôt get me wrong we got upgraded to a beautiful room and we‚Äôre grateful for that.    Shout to Mohammed at breakfast who looked after my wife as she had a few food allergies. Every morning Mohammed has ensured she had a plate of food she could eat ready. This made a huge difference to our holiday and we‚Äôre extreme grateful to him. It‚Äôs touches like this can make a hotel for us. Thank you Mohammed!!    There‚Äôs 2 swimming pools. A smaller one that‚Äôs heated and a larger non-heated one. They have great day beds around the pool and there‚Äôs always enough.    I‚Äôd definitely recommend that the hotel starts leaving some black tea/ breakfast tea in rooms as there‚Äôs a lot of Brits and most like a normal black tea. You just get early grey. Also had to ask for milk/cream in the room as you get coffee but no milk. When you ask it‚Äôs no problem they gave me half a litre of milk.    The first day we got there we tried to get a coffee. I‚Äôd emailed in advance a month or two before to ask if they had oat milk or almond milk and they said yes. Unfortunately they didn‚Äôt have either. They have normal milk or soy. I think as a 5* they should probably have a couple of options outside of soy. To be fair they said they would get some for when we arrived 4 days later and they did. We heard a few people asking for oat or almond milk so I‚Äôm sure as demand increases for it they will start to stock it.    The shuttle is great. It‚Äôs free and runs to the main square and back every day. You just make a reservation and this means you can go out every night for dinner if you want at no cost for the transport.    Sirayne is a beautiful place. Very calm and relaxing with fabulous service. Just a few tiny tiny details that could have made it better but to be fair it‚Äôs pretty fabulous.

Do yourself a favor and find a hotel in the New City!!!  I did not check the location myself and it ended up making our holiday so difficult with transportation and cost us a lot of money.  The hotel is located 15 minutes by car out of town 11 kilometers more specifically and hotel charges 20‚Ç¨ for each transfer to the city.  For example if you want to go to the city twice a day you would pay 80‚Ç¨ per day only for transfers.  You might as well book something else in the city and no need to pay extra.  Regarding transportation to and from the hotel i must say that The hotel does also offer a free shuttle service to and from city but not many routes pet day so it did not help us very much..  The pool is nice and rooms are nice.  The Breakfast was very limited and not at all like a 5 star hotel!  I would say i was disappointed by the breakfast and would agree with other people‚Äôs reviews about it.,Date of stay: October 2019,,Greece,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Poltsats
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,mrbmd wrote a review Oct 2019,30,Not a 5* Hotel,My partner and I stayed at the hotel for 4 nights the location is quite which we really like but it‚Äôs a little far from the center a 25 minute drive away. There is a shuttle service which is useful however the mini van is filthy.  Breakfast had a limited amount of options and wasn‚Äôt very exciting.  The staff could be friendlier and less argumentative however they speak good English which is good. I also think staff should not be allowed to smoke on the main entrance steps there should be a designated staff smoking area.  We had an issue with our rooms garden door not closing properly as it has been forced open at some point damaging the handle and the lock (Room 116) which never got sorted the whole time we stayed there.  Room was nice and big the bed was comfortable but it needed a deep clean the room felt outdated and in need of some maintenance.  The spa treatments have to be booked days in advance as they have very limited spaces. The gym was tiny dark and dirty. It may be a good idea to move the gym into the TV / bar room as it wasn‚Äôt in use once the hole time I was there and it‚Äôs a waited nice room.  We didn‚Äôt venture out to the pool area as much as we had planned as it was so uninviting and there was no pool service.  Overall this hotel isn‚Äôt a 5* hotel i know boutique hotels have less guidelines than branded 5* hotels but this hotel is in desperate need of some maintenance some lovely smelling candles and some chilled background music to create an atmosphere would make such a difference too.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrbmd

Very luxurious breathtaking establishment. We have traveled worldwide and were very impressed with the environment and the added ‚Äòtouches‚Äô making our stay there unforgettable for all the family.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,John Pillar wrote a review Sep 2019,50,A true oasis and the best relaxing holiday I have ever had,Sirayane is such a beautiful boutique hotel. I stayed in the junior suit with a private pool which was amazing. As you would expect everything was clean and tidy.    The areas surrounding the main pool are immaculately maintained and the restaurant was very good with a great mix of options. For breakfast there was pastries pancakes fruit cereals and some local dishes.    The spa was fantastic and I had one of the best massages ever. They also provide a shuttle bus from the hotel which will take you into the centre of Marrakech and bring you back at various times of the day for free.    Every member of staff was extremely attentive cheerful and happy to make sure you have the best possible stay. It was great to see the manager and owner on most days asking people if everything was ok.    One piece of advice I strongly recommend is to pay a bit more when arriving and departing the airport and go for the fast track option. When I was departing there was over a 3hr queue and people were running to the plane due to the excessive long time it took them to get through the various checks.    Will defiantly be returning.,Date of stay: September 2019,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JEPP_1975

Beautiful hotel that is only small so every guest is treated really well by everyone of the really lovely hard working staff. Restaurant food and drinks were dearer than elsewhere but we loved eating here. Girls in the spa were lovely and my massage was fantastic. Rooms are fantastic and the cleaning ladies were brilliant. The free shuttle to the medina was handy but you have to book it in advance so we sometimes took a taxi so no problems. Lovely pool and sitting areas.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Xristos L wrote a review Aug 2019,30,It should be 3 stars..,Well it should be 3 stars not 5..    We were 2 couples and we booked 2 rooms for 4 days.  Let me start from the good parts.  The shuttle service is great and the location is great alsobetween the old medina and the airport.  The stuff even though most of them don't speak english are very kind and helpful.  The restaurant is very nicewe had dinner twice and it was very tasty and clean.  The breakfast though even if it was tasty and fresh it lacked options.  And know the bad part.  Both rooms were not clean.  When we checked in the rooms they had placed rose petals and it was romantic and beautifulbut the rose petals stayed with us during our whole stay.  The cleaning service just stag them in a corner of the room and didn't pick them up..  We also had company...cockroach...  The shower was not clean either.  The worst thing though was the pool area and the pool specific.  The pool was really dirtyespecially the small one both had insects inside them and when we asked a person off the stuff told us that they just live in the water!!!  Sunbeds are very old also..and you cannot eat from the snack menu at the pool!!You have to leave and go to the restaurant...  Overall it is an outdated and neglectic hotel with a lot of potential and a helpful and kind stuff but surely not a 5star hotel.,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Athens, Greece",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/83xristosl
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Toto wrote a review Aug 2019,40,A Great hotel but needs some improvement,"Let's start with the good. The hotel was in a lovely area I personally liked the fact that it is a smaller hotel with fewer people situated in a quiet area. Not too far from the old medina or airport which is good.    The rooms are pretty modern with a rainfall shower we had a garden suite which was lovely led out to the pool with sun chairs and a sofa in our private garden for us to use. The air condition is strange when you're coming into the room from outside you feel nice and cold. But when sleeping at night as it's in an awkward position it doesn't distribute through the room and we were left feeling hot. Also the sockets aren't properly glued into the wall and slightly protrude which i felt was quite dangerous and sometime the power would cut out and go back on.    The hotel offers free shuttle service to drop you in the heart of the old medina which is great also for an extra ‚Ç¨5/ 50dh the shuttle driver could drop us in the new town area which could have cost the same or even more if we took a taxi from the old town there so it was very convenient. The shuttle is limited to a space of about 6 people so if you are in a big group I guess could be inconvenient if there is not enough space but it was 2 of us and there weren't many guests at the time so it was fine for us.    The hotel offers a lot of excursions but tbh there are better legitimate and cheaper options you can find online or even on social media like Instagram so do check those out. Also you get a lot of recommendation by word of mouth that's how we found our old medina tour guide and our desert quad biking tour which were both cheap and wonderful experiences.    The dinner is very tasty definitely get the tajine with figs and walnut it was my favourite! and the bolognese at lunch. However do go out and enjoy the local food as well although the shuttle has specific times it's definitely worth it or they can arrange a taxi for you. I saw some reviews saying it was hard to get taxis to take you back to the hotel but that wasn't the case for us they were always willing.    Some advice for using taxis:  1 always negotiate the price before getting in if they tell you something different once you're at your destination give them the agreed price and go on your way.    2 taxis can take euro or dirhams whichever is easier for you rough conversion for the time of this review was about 10 dh to 1 ‚Ç¨/¬£    3 if you are using a taxi best to take exact change in case someone tries to tell you they don't have change.    4 if you are coming from the old medina/town back tot he hotel it should really only cost you around 50dh and from the new town a maximum of 100 dh haggle and you will get what you want if one person says no another will say yes.    Now back to the review ;)    The staff in general were really friendly. The only extremely negative experience i had at the hotel with a waiter whilst we were having dinner. As me and my sister at the time were the only black people there whilst we were seated for dinner he decided to just place his phone on our table and show us a documentary about black people in prison and how some were converting to Islam which we felt was extremely inappropriate and disrespectful as this isn't a topic to randomly bring up and discuss with people YOU DON'T KNOW! There are many things we wanted to say but when we asked why he thought it was appropriate he said it shows Islam made the black people ""calmer"". Totally disrespect and such an underlying ignorant remark about black people after this we decided to only eat in our room for the rest of the stay and ignored him for the rest of the trip. This is not something you talk about with guests it was so embarrassing as people could see what he was showing us. His ignorance to the topic was outstanding and I believe speaking and imposing your views on people when it comes to race religion gender orientation .. etc should not be allowed especially when you are guests who are just trying to have dinner in peace. Made us extremely pissed off for the rest of the night.    Breakfast was extremely limited and got boring after 3 days. Also the spa barely had any time available. during the day usually like 3 spots and if you don't book in time there's nothing. We felt this is extremely small even for a boutique hotel. However do get a hammam it's worth it.    Other than these issues I would still go back to the hotel it is really lovely they clean the rooms daily give you snacks and water daily and other than the disrespectful and tbh racist waiter the rest were extremely welcoming and helpful and I don't want one bad egg to ruin it for the rest.",Date of stay: August 2019,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TotoLogs
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,reviewer of luxury wrote a review Jul 2019,50,A truly memorable stay!,Travelled as a family with 2 children.  We just returned from a 7 night stay in the deluxe suite with a private pool (where we has the sun from 7am to 7pm) on a half board basis.    This beautiful boutique hotel is truly a memorable place and I will most certainly be returning.    The rooms were clean and a have a lovely space for children. As the hotel is so small you will always find the same staff at breakfast lunch and dinner. Which makes the service level even more personal.    We mainly used our own pool but the main pool is always clean and well staffed.    We stayed on a half board basis (where you can swap between lunch or dinner) which was only a small buffet for breakfast but al-a-carte for lunch and dinner. The menu is not very big so by the end of the stay it did become a little repetitive and the children were a little tired of eating burgers nearly every day. But then we did stay for 7 days and I noticed most residents only came for 2-3 days which would make it perfect. I still had no complaints the food was very good with both Moroccan and Western cuisines.    The free shuttle service is also very helpful takes you directly in the Jamaa al fna square and pickup from the same place throughout the day.    We decided to do a half day tour to see the main sights. This I felt was the best way to do my first visit to marrakech. I would not have gone to some of these roads and streets without a guide. I would highly recommend using a guide for a completely different and more Moroccan experience.    I also used the Spa during my stay I have had a Hammam previously in Turkey and learnt that the Turkish hammam is different to the Moroccan. I personally prefer the Turkish I also had a excellent massage. I was slightly weiry about using the hammam in the city so kept it safe by using the hotel. I was happy with my choice.    A lovely quite and small boutique hotel. Would highly recommend if you are looking for a relaxing stay away from the city.,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reviewer-of-luxury

Food was exceptionally good. Every member of staff was charming but I would like to single out the charming Salah Dean who was very kind when my son became ill during the break. He brought the doctor to our room and couldn't have been kinder. The drivers were all courteous and friendly. Visiting Marrakesh on the free shuttle bus was a highlight - like walking into the pages of a National Geographic article. The quad bike experience - booked through Air B n B was good value and great fun.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,BigFatFred wrote a review Jun 2019,50,Oasis of tranquillity,Lovely welcome on arrival and they obviously tried to get the room ready as soon as possible after our morning arrival from the UK. All the staff were very helpful throughout our week stay. Food to a very good standard as was the choice. Drinks by the pool good though perhaps more regular circuits by the waiter would provide more regular drinks and therefore more income for the hotel?! Only complaint about the room was rather thin walls so if your neighbour is noisy perhaps on a particularly amorous night then it may interrupt your sleep! Aircon was ok but not super cold. Some small sweet biscuit treats were left every day in the room and the mini bar was well stocked even when we asked for more soft drinks instead of alcohol. Very nice pools and very attentive pool assistants with your fresh towel(s) each day. Gym was quite good and there's tennis too. We used the spa a couple of times which was also good and reasonably priced. There's not really anywhere to walk if you're into that for exercise so we were a bit limited in that respect. Free shuttle bus to Marrakech is useful though the city itself wasn't our thing - watch out for people trying to rip you off! Minor ant problem in the room one day but after reporting to reception it was taken care of quickly. Overall a very nice smaller scale hotel - high standards and an oasis of tranquillity.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigFatFred

The hotel is located only 10 minutes by car from the Airport which you can organise through the hotel for 20 Euros. The city centre is only 10 minutes away and you can get there & back by the hotel's free shuttle service.    When we arrived the reception staff were very friendly and welcoming - they provided tea and small biscuit's too. As our room wasn't ready yet (due to us arriving early) the staff asked if we would like to change take a shower etc - they have a little changing room in the spa area of the hotel.    The pool is very clean and very well maintained. The larger pool is slightly colder than the smaller pool (which is slightly heated but both are great temperatures). They have a member of staff who helps with setting up sunbeds handing out towels / parasols etc.    The rooms are very beautiful large and clean. The decor is great. We had a small issue with the mini-fridge not being cold - but the staff were very quick to resolve this!    The food is fabulous! Lots of choice and well reasonably priced. The breakfast is a buffet which has lots of variety (breads pastries yoghurts cereal hot food fruits etc.) I particually loved their dinner menu I tried a few dishes and the food is pretty amazing! Also from the restaurant / bar area you can see the mountains - the view is so lovely!    Overall I cannot recommend this hotel enough!

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,london_traveller6789 wrote a review Apr 2019,50,Oasis of calm just outside of Marrakech.,Sirayane is a beautiful boutique hotel and spa just outside of the hustle and bustle of Marrakech. It is perfect for those that want to experience the Medina and City centre (very regular shuttle bus that runs free of charge through the hotel) but head home to somewhere a little bit more tranquil. It is hard to believe that you are so close to the City centre when you are relaxing by the Sirayane pool! I had high expectations but I think the hotel surpassed these even further. Architecture and design were both stunning and I loved the grand doors and style of the pool and rooms as well as the bar area. Food and drink were very reasonable and delicious with lots of choice. My husband and I both had a massage and thought that again it was incredibly reasonable and good wishing that we had time for more treatments. The gym could be improved but appreciate that this is a challenge for a small hotel but that would be my only improvement comment. We will definitely be back! Thank you for a wonderful stay.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/london_traveller6789

It was just what we needed - a peaceful and relaxing environment with excellent facilities. Food and accommodation were both great and the beautiful gardens and Atlas Mountains backdrop add to the ambience. All the staff were extremely helpful and accommodating. As has been said by others the main section of the pool is not heated. For me it was a welcome contrast to the great weather. We also made use of the free shuttle to the City centre which was a handy way to experience the busy and noisy Medina in contrast to the tranquility of the hotel.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SparkyD1972
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Jon C wrote a review Apr 2019,50,An oasis of calm away from the city,Great little boutique hotel 20 minutes out of the city. Stark modern minimalist style lots of polished concrete and I do mean lots but really well done. Our room was in the main building absolute silence every evening we slept like babies.  Very easy to fall asleep by the pool the only sound we heard was birds.    Good food and reasonably priced one evening I had the filet steak and I was worried what I'd get it was a fantastic piece of meat perfectly cooked.    Bar prices are London prices so nothing too extortionate and a pretty good choice the mint tea is excellent one of the best we had whilst in Marrakech.    Everyone moans about the pool being cold suck it up and get over yourselves it's not that cold even in April.    Service can be a bit hit and miss but everyone had a smile on their faces and nothing was too much trouble a few little touches amiss but other than that a fantastic place to stay.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/822jonc
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Joerp wrote a review Apr 2019,40,Very Nice Hotel But Beware the Upgrade,We stayed in the hotel for 5 nights in April. First of all this is a nice hotel with good staff and facilities. My only issue with the hotel was probably partly my fault but annoying none the less. I had researched the hotel and booked one of the Deluxe suites with private garden and pool. I had planned this quite carefully as the rooms were on the end of the row of suites with the larger gardens . They looked the most peaceful and as it was my wife and my birthdays getaway from the kids we wanted peace and quiet. I emailed in advance and asked for a peaceful room and deliberately did not choose the larger room but smaller garden premium suites as they were bunched closer together. All fine until we get there and get told we have been 'upgraded' to one of the premium suites. This is where my mistake was as I should have just said there and then I would prefer not to be upgraded and could I have the room I booked and asked for. I did not however and low and behold we were surounded on both sides of the small garden with quite noisy families. When this became apparent (first morning) I went and asked if we could move rooms to the original room I booked but was told it was sold already and we could not move. I could see one of the deluxe suites was still empty at this point so I can only assume it was being filled later that week. The manager asked if I would like him to call the noisy room and ask them to quieten down and I said no please dont as I did not want to affect their holiday (it was a family) however he went ahead and did so anyway which made things worse as now we had to listen to our neighbours angrily moaning someone had complained about them. Made us feel a bit awkward when all I wanted was to see if we could move to the room I had booked.  I have seen a lot of reviews where people have been upgraded to pool side villas etc and im sure 90% of the time its a great result however if you are in one of the suites and have researched and booked a particular type just beware the upgrade to the premium ones as in my opinion they are not as nice as the Deluxe ones.  The Spa was very nice. We had a joint Hamman and massages afterwards. We took the bus into town three times. The times coming back are a bit strange. They could do with an extra service around 8pm as you either come back at 6pm or have to wait till 10pm. We did a 14:00pm till 10pm day one day and it was fine but exhausting. Booked excursion to Atlas mountains with an outside company that picked up at the hotel as the hotel prices for same of less trips were quite a lot more. Food was good but could do with keeping the bar snack menu open in the evening for people who dont want a full a la carte menu. All in All we had a nice stay but just needs a few improvements to make it a 5 star review and a 5 star hotel.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoeP3688
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,JulieandTonyB wrote a review Apr 2019,50,Peace and tranquillity in Marrakech,My wife and I spent a week at this hotel from 12th to 19th March and had the most relaxing time we‚Äôve had for some time. So much so as soon as we returned home we booked to come back in March 2020.    The hotel is situated close to the airport and roughly four miles outside the madness of the centre of Marrakech which was perfect. On arrival we were greeted with mint tea and biscuits whilst our paperwork was completed. Our room was not ready but it gave us ample time to relax before we were given a guided tour of the hotel and its grounds. The main thing we noticed was how calming it was this was apparent as soon as we set foot through the doors of the hotel. The area around the pool was immaculately maintained clean and nice and quiet. The receptionists were very helpful and nothing was too much trouble for them.    Our room was cosy and the balcony looked over the tennis court. Outside the hotel grounds there is nothing else around which adds to the peacefulness.    Around the pool there are roughly 25 double bed-sized sunbeds which were very comfy and the pool attendants will bring you a parasol on request. There are two pools the smaller of which was heated but the other was not and was a rather shall we say refreshing way to cool down as the temperature was hotter than usual for the time of year we arrived.    The main bar was nice and relaxing and sold a variety of wines spirits beers and cocktails (also alcohol-free versions). I have attached a copy of the drinks list for reference. There is a sports bar where you can enjoy the football play pool and smoke shisha indoors. There is also a spa where a range of treatments are available. Trips from the hotel are also available but as we've done some of them when we've previously been to Marrakech and we just wanted to relax this time we gave them a miss. However they are good to do.    Breakfast consisted of pastries pancakes fruit cereals and some local dishes as well as some classic British items.    I have also attached menus for lunch and dinner. The food at the hotel was amazing nicely presented and not too small portion-wise. We ate at the hotel apart from one night when we dined at one of the many food stalls on the Djemaa al fna (lovely food and quite expensive but well worth it). In the evening the bar and restaurant were both lovely and quiet but very relaxing. There are many restaurants on the main road to the hotel but the food at the hotel was that good we didn't get to try them this time.    Also attached is the timetable for the shuttle bus from the hotel which will take you into the centre of Marrakech and bring you back at various times of the day. If you wish to make you own way back to the hotel the receptionists recommend you catch one of the larger taxis back and pay no more than 150 dirhams. We did a tour of the city on the city bus and paid 190 dirhams each (roughly ¬£15.00). The tour has two routes - red and green - and is a great way to see the new and old parts of the city. You're also given headphones to listen to facts on the tour. You can also hop on and off the bus at the many stops on the route just in case you want to have a look round.    You can exchange money at the hotel but they recommend you use the banks in the city centre. At the time of our stay we we getting roughly 12.6 dirhams to the pound.    The centre of Marrakech appears to be a lot cleaner and tidier than when we first came many years ago and this is probably due to more investment tourism and properties being built in the outskirts of the city. However it's still a city very close to our hearts and we will return whenever we can.    In all this hotel is wonderful and a real way to get away from everything even though the bustling city is only four miles away. We're counting down the days until we come back and can't wait.,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bolton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulieandTonyB

Fabulous rooms (private garden) with the hotel being small you feel very at home. Wonderful food spa treatments and service with staff going above and beyond for you- eg I had showered after a spa treatment and the lady at the spa reception noticed I had wet hair so she offered to dry it for me as she knew we had checked out and about to go to the airport. Free shuttle bus to the town was really useful but everything so nice at the hotel we only left once. Great room service option to use half board at lunch time was also appreciated.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,EJLH wrote a review Apr 2019,50,Suite 119,We have just retuned from a wonderful 5 day stay at the Sirayane Boutique Hotel and Spa and wish we had booked a little longer.    Our arrival and check in was seamless and the service was first class from the minute we arrived. We were met at the car and taken into a stunning and cool reception where we were served mint tea and snacks while we completed the paperwork. Aimad (who is a superb ambassador for the hotel) took us on a tour of the grounds and showed us to our room where we were met with our luggage.    And wow what a room. A spacious suite with a large pool and a sizeable garden. We have stayed in a lot of private pool suites but this was one of the best in terms of size and quality.    The hotel is much more beautiful than the photos on the website make it look. Being only 32 rooms the hotel never felt crowded and despite its proximity to the airport and town it couldn‚Äôt have been more peaceful. The design and layout of the hotel is stunning and being able to see the snow capped mountains in the background was magical.    We had the misfortune of having a few days of rain so ate in the hotel more than we would have. The quality of the hotel food was generally very good and fairly reasonably priced even the room service (although this is a very limited menu). A few people have mentioned that breakfast could be a little haphazard and whilst this is true it was still perfectly ok.    The free shuttle into the Medina was regular and reliable and had the weather been better we would have used it more but this really is a great service that the hotel provides as it saves the guests what could be a significant amount of money in taxi fares. The car service to the airport is also very good value compared to the taxis who can essentially charge what they like to a captive market.    What puts this hotel head and shoulders above others is the staff and the completely personal service. The owner of the hotel greeted us at check in and was usually present in the hotel checking that the guests were being treated well and genuinely interested in the welfare of his guests. The staff whether it be in the reception shuttle restaurants bars or cleaners are all fantastic and can‚Äôt do enough for you.    It is one of the most peaceful and relaxing breaks I have ever had and I cannot recommend this hotel enough. I thought I was done with Marrakech having been here twice already but this hotel is the reason I can see myself returning time and time again for a few days of total relaxation in beautiful and tranquil surroundings.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EJLH

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Boosh12345 wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Oasis of calm near to the city,Stayed at the hotel for a week on a half board basis in March.    The hotel is approx 20 minutes from both the airport and the city. During the stay the hotel provides free transport to and from the centre of Marrakesh.    The hotel is a small modern hotel with the rooms around a pool. The room we had was a garden room a lovely large bedroom with its own small garden. The rooms were very clean and tidy.    The hotel has a bar and restaurant that serves local cuisine as well as some european food It has a decent selection but if you are intending to eat every evening in the hotel and you are there for a full week it can get a little repetitive. The food is of a decent quality for the price.    he hotel is a lovely quiet oasis away from the hustle and bustle of the city. There is nothing to do for small children and it is possibly better if it were adult only.    The only downside to the stay was that one of the pools (the larger one) is not heated so very cold in March and therefore hardly used,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Boosh12345

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,UkGMan wrote a review Mar 2019,50,"Haven away, but close, to the centre of Marrakech",When the taxi first takes you you wonder where you're going! Tucked down a long road off the main road you'd never stumble across this place! But what a little haven it is. Very calm and relaxed and in lovely surroundings. Greeting was very civilised - mint tea in reception as we booked in and our bags magically disappearing to the room.    Room was big and spacious with a balcony overlooking the pool. Good air con - cold but quiet!  Minibus to and from town centre was very efficient and useful. Just remember to check the front - every hotel seems to use the same black van!  Pool was clean with bits to swim in and other bits to float and cool off. It's not a dry hotel so quite nice sitting in the pool with a beer.  Food comes up a few times in the review so our take. The food was generally pretty good. I think people have to also remember I think that most guests go into Marrakech to eat in the evening and most don't stay that many nights. It's a balance of having stock for a broader menu versus how many times someone will actually eat there.    One minor thing for us - more a mildly amusing anecdote than a complaint. We had a late flight and asked if we could use a room to shower and change before we left to which they instantly said yes and said we could use the spa. Unfortunately this was news to the spa. They were happy for us to do so...just bizarrely they had no towels so we had to use robes to dry ourselves?!,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"St. Albans, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UkGMan

The room was spacious and well laid out which was spotlessly cleaned every day. Lovely sheets on the bed.    The restaurant food in the restaurant is excellent and is well used both at lunch and dinner. Breakfast is a buffet - but could be better (but perfectly adequate). The bar area is very nice and local wine at dinner is reasonable priced.    The staff are all very friendly and very helpful.    There is a small gym tennis court and spa. We had a massage which was great and reasonably priced    The hotel is located about 8km from the centre of Marrakech and given its proximity to the airport you cannot hear any aircraft noise and the place is very peaceful - which is in contrast to Marrakech itself which is bedlam (in a good way). So if you want to relax and chill out this is the place.    The hotel runs a shuttle service to the town through the day. You can get back by taxi which costs about 20Euros.    My only advice for the management ( I stay in lots of high end hotels around the world) is that is important to keep the hotel well-maintained and fix things when they break and keep on top of the decor. There were a few bits falling off the walls in our room!! Also an English TV channel would be useful.

Long story short within hours of arriving at Sirayane I fell Ill with influenza and a chest infection.    Bad situations happen on holiday but having support there when it all goes wrong is what is needed the most and this is where the service of your 5* hotel will either shine or fail.    I stayed for 4 days Flu kicked in within an hour of getting to the room (obviously brought it from the UK) from which point I was bed bound for 95% of the stay until going to the airport.    Throughout the entire time the staff were AMAZING. On day 2 my Fiance asked for a doctor. 45 minutes later there was a doctor in my room checking me over and prescribing me medicines. We had a problem in that we had no money cash as we had just arrived. The staff covered the cost of the doctor went to a pharmacy for us and picked up our medicine and we were asked to pay it back later which we did (and of course with a tip!).    On the last day our flight was at 9pm checkout was at 12. Staff moved some rooms around in order for us to stay in the room until 3pm which was a relief as we didnt need to leave the hotel until 6:30 for the airport.    Throughout the stay every member of staff was excellent. I have been lucky enough to stay in four 5* hotels in the past 4 weeks and I genuinely believe that none of the others could have looked after us like I felt looked after here.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Hester172 wrote a review Jan 2019,50,Fantastic,Firstly I don‚Äôt generally leave reviews as I leave this to my wife as she can explain things better than me. I do feel though on this occasion want to leave an honest review.  When we first arrived we were greeted at the airport by a representative of the hotel who was very smart and a nice Mercedes car. Being honest the drive to the hotel did seem to be a little rural but this concept soon changed as this is quite normal for a desert resort and as we soon found out was the perfect distance away from the busy centre and became to us a welcome oasis when we returned from the centre in their courtesy vehicle. I played golf early every day and left my wife at the hotel who felt so safe and we felt assured that any problems if any would be resolved with no question. Not that we had any problems at all. The resort is FANTASTIC and has everything you need and is cleanquiet and very relaxing. The gym is enough heated pool to over 80. I will not single out one member of staff as everyone including all the back staff you generally don‚Äôt see which I did every morning at 7am ensuring the whole place was spotless. Polite staff everywhere and nothing was trouble to them.  The owner is very hands on and is a great guy and knows what clients want which is all the above at a very realistic price. We are so glad we chose to stay outside as we were here for 10 nights and that time in a Riad in the centre would have been unbearable due to the noise and the commotion. But still an amazing place to visit with so much to see.  My best review is that I would not hesitate to return when we come back to Marrakech. For you golfers out there the position of this hotel is perfect for at least a dozen great courses and they will arrange all your travel and bookings for you.

Plus points: excellent and reasonable airport pick up/drop off service  the biggest doors you will ever walk through outside a castle  a spa that can do 'proper' massage not just faff around gently rubbing your skin  extremely well trained polite and willing staff from waiters front desk ground staff pool guys and room service...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..all happy to smile!  owner evident on site and very enthusiastic about his business without overpowering you  reasonable rates all presented in itemised bill as agreed and signed for  good sized poolside villa with garden; kettle etc provided and verbena tea rather than the ubiquitous lemon or mint varieties  Super-comfortable beds  chef know his stuff with traditional and French in the main but with ingredients from Chinese and Thai styles.  Christmas Eve menu was inventive and very reasonable [¬£30 for three courses] unlike many tourist spots where you can be charged ten times more for a miserable take on Xmas fare.  A sense that nothing would be too much trouble meant our 11 day stay was seamless; we seemed to be there for at least twice as long as other people who used it as a relaxing point after hectic travelling around before flying home  Easy and regular shuttle to Marrakech that could be ordered at short notice  Could do better [observations not over- important]  Better demarcation of responsibilities and duties at breakfast; often a lot of staff either doing the same thing or not noticing things that need to be done [topping up food plates cutlery no salt and pepper]  Let guests slice own bread sticks; if late bread has dried out  All in all this is not a Western city centre hotel so if it is accepted that you are eight kilometres from a major city in a country which is very different to your own you can relax and do nothing much or as much as you want knowing that you will be fed watered and looked after by kind and friendly people in an interestingly designed mini-resort.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Brighton and Hove, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gordonw210

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Jilna K wrote a review Dec 2018,40,Relaxing,Hotel was beautiful and quiet a perfect break in December.    Hotel is 15 mins from the airport by car. Transport can be arranged by the hotel for ‚Ç¨20 (from what I remember). Unfortunatelywe didn't know we ended up getting a taxi at the airport for 320 dirhams which is a lot. Driver started off at 400 but remember to negotiate. Technically should cost 200 dirhams aka ¬£18-20.    Arrival at the hotel was very pleasant!! Reception offered moroccan tea (worth trying) and fresh biscuits. While our paperwork was being sorted for checkin. This only took 10 to 15mins. Then a short tour of the hotel. Staff spoke English okay but mostly french.    The room was a mini suite with garden and access to the main pool. Roses decorated all over the bathroom area and lovely modern rooms. Turn down service and cleaning was impeccable with two bottles of water provided everyday.    The hotel was quiet and relaxing by the pool. Free shuttle service to the old town(the matkets) but odd timings and must book 2hr in advance with an extra 50 dirhams to the new town (shopping malls).    Breakfast is mediocre personally i think the hotel could improve on this offer a better variety.    Spa within the hotel was nice. We had a 60 min massage which perfect way to end our holiday. Theres no spa pool or Jacuzzi or sauna just treatments.    Sports room available to watch all main football matches. Fire place room was so beautiful and peaceful to just sit and unwind infront of a log fire.    Overall the hotel was wonderful experience. Would recommend for a wuiet breakaway from the city hussle bussle.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jilnak2018

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,spmoraes wrote a review Dec 2018,50,"Relaxing, quiet hotel outside the Marrakech Medina",My wife and I finished up a 10 day trip to Morocco by staying at the Sirayane Hotel. We began our trip staying in a Riad in the heart of the Medina. After travelling through Morocco and fighting the crowds the various Medinas we visited we wanted a quiet peaceful night in Marrakech the night before we left for back home. The Sirayane Hotel did not disappoint!    When we entered the hotel we could tell that we made the right choice. The grounds are strikingly beautiful and tranquil.    We were shown to our room after having the requisite welcome tea and cakes. The room was well apportioned and comfortable with a large glass wall facing the pool area.    We had dinner that evening at the hotel's restaurant and the menu had a nice mix of both Moroccan and French fare. It was a delicious meal in a nicely decorated dining room. The next morning we had breakfast in the same room and let me tell you... the breakfast is not to be missed! The breakfast buffet had everything we could have asked for! Everything was fresh and delicious!    If you are looking for a quiet place to get away form the hustle and bustle of Marrakech's Medina I would definitely recommend the Sirayane Boutique Hotel and Spa.,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cologne, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sluggo63
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Dr P L wrote a review Dec 2018,40,Very good value for money - Great service and kitchen,I would believe this is best value for money in Marrakesh.    If you don¬¥t care that you are not in the city center the compound is well designed and quite. Kids are allowed which leads sometimes to a noise.    Rooms are well done with a large shower. You need to accept Morrocon standards when it comes to the last finish but it is not disturbing. Unfortunately the hotel seems to have very bad satellite reception every tv channel has interruptions every few seconds which drives you nuts. The fridge didn't really work.    The service attitude is exceptional throughout the whole staff. They make you feel really taken care of.    The kitchen is outstanding especially regarding Moroccon and Thai dishes. The breakfast buffet could have some wider selection especially when it comes to sausages and meat. Fresh fruits and freshly pressed juice are delicious. We went once for food to the Fairmont while playing golf they are miles below the food quality of Sirayane.    The spa closes a little early and I was disappointed by the massage. I usually don¬¥t take massages anymore in hotels as the quality can be quite different. Here I got tortured leading to blue marks all over my back on the next day. Seems as if the lady was not well educated on massage at all.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Hazel W wrote a review Nov 2018,50,Very peaceful and relaxing break.,Our 'suite' was lovely and exceeded our expectations.It was close to the pools so we only had a 10m stroll to take a dip in the heated pool each evening. The pool was very clean and towels readily available. The whole site was very well maintained with an interesting range of vegetation around which is home to a wide variety of birds.  We chose to eat in each evening from the Moroccan menu and found the food to be very nice (and plentiful). There were so many tasty options it was hard to decide what to choose when we were only there for a few nights. Staff were very polite and helpful with many of them speaking English well. We used the shuttle to Marrakesh.  I enjoyed the spa facilities and felt that the treatments were reasonably priced and very relaxing (full body massage and a foot massage).  We took a half day tour with a guide. through the hotel which was disappointing. We were collected on time and the guide spoke very good English. He had asked us what we would like to see and we told him - points of interest around the city but not really the Medina and Souks. It started off well going to the Jewish quarter and the Bahir Palace (extra cost) but then we trekked down endless alleyways of stalls for over an hour to end up in the Medina - for some free time - then to meet him at a particular coffee shop before our return. Part of the way back to the hotel the guide left us with the driver for the remainder of the journey back to the hotel. We were with the guide for less than half of the allotted 4 hours of the tour and we saw little of the highlights of Marrakesh that we had hoped for.  Marrakesh airport arrivals was awful be prepared for a long wait (in the region of 2 hours waiting) to go through passport control.,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Brigg, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrandTour66808184642
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,emerald777 wrote a review Nov 2018,50,Perfect Hide Away,Having decided to stay at the Sirayane we contacted the hotel to enquire about transfers golf and travel between golf courses. They could not have been more helpful sending a list of courses within the vicinity. Once we had decided which ones we wanted to play our tee times were reserved for us and transport between the hotel and golf arranged. Also transfers to and from the airport to the hotel as we were independent travellers. The service was superb and everything was more than we expected.    On arrival we were greeted with a refreshing drink of tee and made to feel very welcome. Our room was delightful and the setting ideal. We had a small private garden which was perfect and after playing golf to sit in the late afternoon sun eating cakes and drinking a welcome cup of tea was so relaxing. Our room was bright very clean - at the end of 6 nights the soles of the slippers provided were as clean as when we had taken them out of the packet and that is rare. There was a large wet room with two shower heads and a separate toilet and then a washbasin and vanity area. Our bed was super comfortable.    Breakfast was a delight with a large selection of yoghurts cereals fruit juices as well as a hot buffet or an omelette or poached eggs could be ordered. There were plenty of pastries and lots of breads. It catered for every taste. For me it was bliss to have a large bowl of pomegranate and freshly sliced sweet oranges. Lunch was good and offered a good selection of sandwiches pastas and other dishes. Dinner for me was perfect the service wonderful and the food excellent. I had read reviews where it was stated the meals were expensive but I disagree. The menu had a variety of dishes to suit most palettes and we ate in every evening and nothing failed to please us every meal was delicious. Congratulations go to the Food and Beverage Manager who was always there in the back ground checking and appeared to have his finger on every button this meant everything ran smoothly. Sometimes we did wait a little longer for our chosen meals but this was because everything was freshly prepared and it was worth those few extra minutes.    After dinner each evening we retired to the lounge where there was a big and welcoming log fire with plenty of comfortable seats around. We were spoiled as the staff would come and more our chairs up to the fire and it was so warm relaxing and made a perfect end to each day.    The pool area was lovely with large sun beds which were well spaced and with two pools on unheated and the other the temperature of a tepid bath - it made swimming a very pleasant experience.    I would most certainly have no qualms about recommending the Sirayane as a perfect place to stay. It offered us a tranquil and relaxing place to chill out and we most certainly will return.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Nick T wrote a review Nov 2018,40,"Very nice hotel, a few things could make it almost perfect",Having returned from a week at the Sirayane where we (family with two teenagers) had a great time I wanted to write a short summary of how good the Hotel was and perhaps a few things to improve    Overall the hotel is a very good place to spend a week (more and you would probably struggle for food options on the menu) and food is the area that would benefit from a little extra attention    Breakfasts are buffet style and other than an omelette no other ‚Äòcustom‚Äô options seemed available however reading another reviewers comment it seems if you asked for eggs cooked in a way you prefer they would do this! Why they don‚Äôt tell you this I don‚Äôt know as the buffet scrambled are very runny and not everyone wants an omelette every day! The service during breakfast is great thoigh and the staff very helpful with teas/coffees etc    Dinner service again was frustrating as in addition to some very long waits (50 mins on one evening) for meals to arrive the inconsistent quality of the meals was bizarre one day it would be amazing and the food very good indeed the next it was like someone had been dragged into the kitchen to cook for the first time not indelible but just so very different in quality which was a real shame (perhaps different cooks as the busyness levels didn‚Äôt seem to directly reflect the quality    The rooms (we had two garden rooms) were comfortable and other than the replenishment of soap (only 2 all week) and the mini bar missed on one day we had fresh biscuits every day and everything was spotlessly clean so no complaints sadly the walls seemed quite thin as listening to the person next door going to the toilet so clearly was a little awkward in the mornings!    The pools are beautiful but very cold (even the heated one) not unusable but we only ventured in once and saw only one other family in the pool all week    Some things though do need to be sorted we had a couple of wet days and on checking out the games room saw two broken cues on asking at reception the last basically said sorry we have ordered a replacement but it hasn‚Äôt come in the end they glued a replacement tip to one cue so we could play pool but surely just to order 3 or 4 new cues at a cost of a few hundred dirhams wouldn‚Äôt hurt!    The spa was fabulous my wife and I had treatments (and I actually had an extra massage as it was so relaxing) and the Hammam experience (first time) was highly recommended especially if you have never had one before    The service throughout the week was exceptional and when we wanted to go out to a restaurant outside of the city reception were great in organising a car for us (440 dirhams for both ways which took all the hassle out of haggling with local taxis) also it‚Äôs worth noting the hotel is quite a way out of the city itself so I imagine the cost of a taxi would be very high    Overall as mentioned with a few tweaks the Sirayane could be almost perfect for a short break away but even now is very good.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/554nickt

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,sophie_tollman wrote a review Nov 2018,50,Lovely Retreat,Absolutely fallen in love with this place. On arrival we were greeted with Moroccan tea and pastries. We were told about the many trips and shuttles that were on offer.    We were told that they had upgraded our rooms my parents to a large suite with private pool and garden. My sister and I had been upgraded to a garden room with views over the pool.    The staff are one of a kind so attentive to every aspect of our holiday. They would literally do anything for you but were also very interested in our trip and ready with any tips that they thought were useful.    I couldn‚Äôt have been happier on this holiday. The trips were insane and from the choice we chose to do quad biking & camel riding. The quad biking around the dessert was so worth the money a 2hr trip including views tricks and a stop at a local house for tea and bread. The camel riding was an experience as a family we were nervous for this but the guides were lovely and supportive with a few laughs at us here and there- became quite relaxed. Really brought us together as a family and where else do you get the opportunity to dress the part.    Also on our holiday we took a trip to the markets. The hotel were super helpful with organizing this from shuttles to tips on handling the markets. They recommended to go to a rooftop bar to look at the views and the sunset which were incredible.    The hotel itself is amazing I‚Äôve never experienced anything like it. The many WiFi‚Äôs are amazing the sunbeds are like no other and there are many rooms within to relax with a book and enjoy the peace and quiet. The spa experience is lovely and the prices are reasonable too. I recommend the facial which included a scalp and foot massage.    I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone thinking about coming to Marrakech. It definitely gets a 5 star rating from me without a doubt.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sophie_tollman

The spa was a wonderful experience too with very talented therapists. The room was just lovely and the whole resort was immaculate - it was a fabulous retreat. I managed to break my toe on the last day catching it on a bed and the assistance I received was amazing. Within seconds I was attended to - The Manager himself oversaw everyone whilst helping me - the spa therapists helped with ice and massage ease my little toe back whilst I lay back with a special mocktail and was made very comfortable.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Adina G wrote a review Oct 2018,40,"Hotel is very nice, some staff are quite disappointing",The hotel is about 15-20 minutes away from the city centre. The property itself it very nice rooms are big facilities are nice pool is really good nice breakfast and I would have given 5 out of 5 stars if it wasn't for some rude staff at the reception. On the day of our check-in on 30th Sep 18 around 21:00 the person that was at the reception really had a horrible attitude and he was either speaking with a superior tone or was a bit ironic. We did not feel welcomed at all no presentations about the hotel no nothing only some ironic comment on what makes us think that their taxi / private transfers are so expensive. Trust me we don't get upset easily but me and my husband were really but really annoyed with this guide (that by the way didn't have a name tag as he should have no?).  On the other hand on the 2nd day in the morning at the reception we discussed with Youssef who was amazing such a kind person gave us a map of the city asked us if we need anything if our stay was ok on the first night small things but they do make a difference - correct?  On our check-out at the reception Nada was there with the guy that made the check-in for the first night - she was talking on her personal phone made us wait for a while until we could check-out. Then started talking in Arabic with her colleague (if I am not mistaken) and I am telling you they were talking about us as we could clearly notice that - very rude.  Suggestions: promote Youssef or ask him to train his colleagues as they have a lot to learn from him.  If you need a hotel to relax this is the perfect place to go all the other aspects are ok but as I said sometimes some unprofessional staff can ruin the overall experience.,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adinaGa

Staff - excellent - very attentive unobtrusive and friendly.  Food - Breakfast (included) - Good buffet selection including some cooked to order items. Lunch and evening meals also good but limited choice if you dined in all week.    BUT why would you? - There is a free shuttle at various times during the day - takes you straight into town centre with plenty to see and do there - and Guided Tours / Trails and Treks can also be arranged from the Hotel Reception etc.    Stayed in November last year for our 30th Wedding anniversary and had a wonderful time.,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Great Bookham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/706terryp
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Stephen C wrote a review Sep 2018,50,"Beautiful, comfortable and excellent staff",We stayed for 3 nights after a desert tour and it was the perfect way to end the holiday. The room was immaculate the surroundings beautiful and most importantly after a desert trip the bed was extremely comfortable. The staff were as professional and friendly as any I've ever met and everything went seamlessly. It's about 10 minutes drive out of the main city though so unless you speak the local language better than I could it's best to have the name and maybe even the Google map location handy for any taxi drivers. You probably won't need a taxi though as the hotel offers a very handy pick up and drop off service straight into the centre.,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Wexford, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P1057SEstephenc
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,EmilyBurditt wrote a review Sep 2018,50,Beautiful hotel to escape to,We were lucky enough to stay here for a week as a winter break. The hotel is a very high standard: the rooms are large and luxurious and service impeccable. The food was also excellent - we ate breakfast and lunch there several times. The pool was fantastic - one pool is colder and the other is heated. The hotel was very quiet and there aren‚Äôt many guest rooms which is fantastic as you really get to relax and all the staff get to know you. They have a free shuttle which takes you into the centre of Marrakech several times a day which is a nice bonus as getting taxis to take you back to the hotel is difficult.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Blessing L wrote a review Sep 2018,50,The most relaxing hotel ever!,Special thanks to Aimad Enes and Badar for their excellent service. They amongst others made our stay easy and enjoyable.    The hotel is located away from the busy city centre but there are frequent free shuttles so you won‚Äôt miss anything.    On arrival we were greeted with Moroccan tea and biscuits followed by a tour of the hotel before we were ushered to our rooms.    The rooms are spacious and clean.    The main pool is never overly busy and there is always someone available to help with ordering food/drinks & assistance with sun beds and towels. We also enjoyed shisha at the pool side.    We had breakfast included in our package which was good. We often ate lunch and dinner at the hotel and the service and food was always good.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Paul D wrote a review Sep 2018,50,Relaxing!!,We spent a week with the hotel and had the most relaxing holiday in a long time. The staff are tremendous and cannot do enough for you.    The room was spacious serviced every day and the pool area superb. The pool attendants cannot do enough for you but that is common from all of the staff.    Breakfast fast good with a selection of pastries breads hot food and continental options available. The hotel offers a morrocan menu and international one for dinner as well as a lunch menu. Overall the food was good particularly the Morrocan food and I would recommend the couscous dishes and Tagine.    We had a couple's spa day and done the hammam and massage well worth it and the pricing is slightly cheaper than the UK for a massage.    The shuttle bus into the main square and back is hassle free and a good option so I would recommend to anyone to use it and venture out in Marrakech.

Hotel has a large pool and a bar/lounge area.    The included breakfast is great and has lots of variety. Dinner (international menu only) was above average but not outstanding.

We found them all to be true! After the hectic pace of Marrakech it was a joy to return to this hotel during our weeks stay. The pool area is beautiful quiet and peaceful -no music everyone speaks quietly and respects the peace and tranquility.  The staff were always friendly and positive trying to meet your every request. The pool man knew we liked to be in the shade under the umbrella as the sun moved during the day he quietly moved our umbrella without us even asking!  We enjoyed breakfast -a range of cereals breads/pastries fruit as well as hot food. Omelettes cooked to order. Dinner was either Moroccan or European. We felt there was a good variety and nicely prepared one night we had a scallops starter-fabulous!! We were surprised how much we enjoyed the variety of Moroccan wine on offer as well.  We used the free shuttle to get into/from Marrakech quite often.The hotel even arranged a car to take us and collect us from a restaurant so we didn‚Äôt need to worry about finding a taxi and haggling about the price.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,BenLaxLost wrote a review Sep 2018,50,7 Days in the Moroccan Sun,I picked this hotel as a birthday gift for my partner. It had amazing reviews across Trip Advisor. One thing that worries me was the distance from Marrakech centre. This was not an issue at all! There are a number of complementary shuttles each day to take you right into the centre of the hustle and bustle then bright you back to tranquility.    We had a pool view room which was amazing to wake up to. The balcony was a great way to sit back with a book / Netflix episode after a long day of wading through the markets or museums.    Breakfast is included and was very fresh. Tip: try the local pancake style rolls.    The staff were always on hand to help out. We had an 11pm flight on departure day and they let us use the facilities and shower ready for our transfer.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Transition P wrote a review Aug 2018,50,Fabulous hotel,This is a gorgeous little hotel just far enough out of the main city to feel like you are in paradise. The staff can‚Äôt do enough for you and are so friendly and welcoming. We were upgraded to a suite with a private garden which was just a few steps to the pool.  The pool area is quiet never more than about a dozen people. We would have preferred less toddlers around as there‚Äôs nothing for them to do at all and although the hotel is not billed as adults only the vibe they are trying to achieve doesn‚Äôt lend itself to small children.  The breakfast is excellent with many things to choose from and eggs cooked to order.  Evening meal was delicious we ate the Moroccan menu twice and found it to be authentic with very large portions!  Drinks are reasonably priced for a 5* hotel and we recommend the Medallion red or white wine.  We had a Hammam with one hour massage in the spa which was to die for! The Hammam was incredible and left our skin unbelievably soft and the massage was incredibly relaxing.  The hotel transfer was very reasonable and the free shuttle to the medina is a great touch and picks up/ drops off at exactly the advertised times and couldn‚Äôt be in a better location.    This is a superbly relaxing and luxurious hotel that you will love!

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Lauren S wrote a review Aug 2018,50,An oasis of tranquility outside of the city,Sirayane is only 20 minutes by car from Jemaa al Fna square but it could be a million miles away from the hustle and bustle of the city. We chose Sirayane as the main reason for our trip was relaxation and chilling out as a family combined with a little sightseeing spread over 5 days. We arrived at Sirayane at about 8.30pm and it was lovely to check in while drinking mint tea in the lobby. Our room (mini suite private garden) was perfect for 3 of us. Well decorated furnished and equipped. The pool area is absolutely lovely and the staff were amazing at supplying towels and offering drinks on a regular basis. Sirayane is a very quiet resort and is perfect for couples honeymooners and quiet families. Many of the guests when we were there were French or Moroccan which was great! We met some nice people and I got to practise my basic French skills. House-keeping at Sirayane was excellent and the room is well stocked with mineral water and toiletries. There are plenty of nooks and crannies to enjoy a drink read a book etc - it is a real oasis of calm. The sports bar area is nice (especially for kids) - football on the tv plus a pool table. The wi-fi at the resort is excellent - the best I've experienced in a hotel.    Breakfast lunch and dinner can be taken in the restaurant or on the patio overlooking the pool area. The menu is extensive and the food is tasty and fresh. The waiting staff are helpful courteous and kind and will accommodate special requests where possible.    The free shuttle service to and from the main Jemaa al Fna square is brilliant. On time and very reliable. An excellent service and saves lots of time and money on taxis.    There are no downsides to Sirayane at all. It really is a very relaxing place. There were a couple of niggles that I had during our stay but they were so minor I won't bother mentioning them here. I would definitely recommend Sirayane and I would definitely go back.,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaurenS591

The only negative I can say is the homemade marmalade pots in the Morning breakfast are too big!..... Literally we are really searching for negatives...    The only suggestion I would make would be requesting the excellent free shuttle service to add a drop off point in the 'new town' as this would help and make a refreshing change to be collected from a nicer less chaotic than the drop off point in the Medina... (which is an experience in itself)    the rooms are excellent we had room 125 which had a private garden although rarely used as the sunbeds are so comfy! and the pool area is the most relaxing pool area you could imagine just the sound of birds and a very faint prayer....    The pool attendants are very attentive not letting you so much as move your parasol yourself ! they are on it straight away... and to correct another review people weren't reserving their sunbeams this would have been done by the attendants themselves as we were here for 2 weeks and our bed was already set ups for us every single day along with others who he knew would be there.    we will definitely be back....    ps the Hamam & Spa is exceptional !,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/89mojo

We stayed a week and would go back in a heartbeat I have never stayed anywhere which was so peaceful and relaxing. We stayed in a standard room in the main hotel one of a few on the first floor with views over the pool area the room was huge with 2 sofas a queen size bed 3 double wardrobes a massive walk in shower a desk area and there was still a huge amount of space. The bed was extremely comfortable the linen was changed daily fresh biscuits and water provided daily and plenty of towels.  The pool area was divine there were always enough sun beds never a problem getting one and the pool attendants were always one step ahead in terms of positioning the parasols to give shade providing extra cushions fresh towels etc.  The staff in the bar and restaurant were attentive informative and happy to help with any needs. We opted for the half board option and never struggled for choice from the menu the food quality for breakfast lunch and dinner was excellent.  The free shuttle service into the medina was brilliant and pretty unbelievable when you consider a taxi was ‚Ç¨20 one way. The hotel is about 7km from the centre but that's no more than a 10 minute drive in the shuttle and with 5 trips in an out per day plenty of options.  Finally the Spa was one of the best ever the massage was truly heavenly and the pedicure superb.

We wanted peace luxury and time for ourselves and that‚Äôs exactly what we got. Due to our late flight we didn‚Äôt get to the hotel until past 11pm but the reception team were extremely helpful despite the inconvenient time and even brought a glass of champagne for us both. We had our luggage taken up to our room whilst one of the team gave us a brief tour around the hotel. The hotel decor was absolutely incredible and we couldn‚Äôt believe how beautiful and contemporary it was. When we got to our room we realised we had been upgraded to a much larger suite than what we had booked with a pool view! The spa was incredible my partner had a full body massage and I had the pregnancy massage. After working in a spa myself I can honestly say it was one of the best massages I have ever had. The women who worked in there were so attentive and really helped us to relax on our getaway. The staff were all brilliant and wouldn‚Äôt let you lift a finger especially one of the gentleman who worked by the pool who would come scooting over with towels and pillows as soon as he seen you walking down to the pool. I think his name was Aimad such a gentleman who would ask every day how my baby was :). He would even come and move the umbrella throughout the day for shade when the sun moved. Another special member of staff was Soufiane who helps us find all the best places to visit in Marrakech and helped my partner when he suffered from extreme toothache during our stay. Again he couldn‚Äôt do enough for us and nothing was ever too much. We also met the owner whilst we was there who came over to our table introduced himself and asked if we was enjoying our stay which we thought was a nice touch.

The room was everything we needed and more with a lovely open shower and very comfortable bed. Sirayane boutique was a great hotel for what we wanted to do... completely relax!! It's pretty far away from other restaurants and the Medina (which could cost you around ¬£20 per trip there and back) which meant we were pretty restricted and ate at the hotel each evening- which was lovely for the first few days but then got rather samey. I would suggest maybe changing up the menus every few days! If we were here for any longer it would have got rather annoying. Nonetheless we had a fantastic experience at Sirayane Boutique Hotel and the staff we're fantastic (we we're so impressed at how many languages they speak!)

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,sarah w wrote a review Jul 2018,50,Wonderful peaceful hotel - 5*,We visited this hotel in July 2018 and the experience was wonderful the day after arrival they gave us a free upgrade due to a room confusion with our Holiday provider.    They were always helpful where possible giving us maps of the square and advice. The free shuttle makes this place as it's 20mins outside the Medina so would be costly otherwise (¬£10-20 each way) with various times you can go out early to shop for souvenirs or late for evening meals (shuttle times are on their website).    The rooms are clean and luxurious with attentive maid staff. The bar and restaurant staff we very friendly and helpful either in the hotel or at the poolside. The restaurant manager even came around the pool to ask if you wanted an evening reservation. The food we had was very good either at the restaurant or room service again very attentive staff coming to collect plates after we've eaten immediately.    The WiFi was very good with multiple routers to connect to around the site with no passwords. My husband watched Netflix with no issues loading.    A little tip although there were many English channels with films on the TVs in two of the rooms we stayed in did have usb ports at the back so you could take a usb filled with films and TV shows and watch them in the room - we did have to search for the ports with our phone lights but they were on the left side just behind the TV.    Around the pool they had double sized leather beds to sunbathe on and the pool guy was over like a shot with towels or if you needed shade. No need to reserve beds as a 1/3 were empty most days and the hotel was full - this is because the majority of the hotel rooms had private gardens or pools so people sat there instead.    We will definitely be returning in the future as it was perfect for us having the quiet of the pool and hotel and the shuttle to the busy Medina when needed.

My partner had also mentioned to the hotel that it was my birthday and without asking they scattered red rose petals everywhere very romantic!    We booked a suite with private garden which was lovely and the pool was a few feet away from our garden. The location of the hotel is secluded and peaceful the only noise you can hear is the birds tweeting and the swimming pool. The hotel is visually stunning amazing decor high ceilings and doorways you can't help but feel very comfortable here. The breakfast buffet was amazing great selection including fantastic coffee and a range of amazing fresh juices. The food is fantastic we had lunch and dinner at the hotel a couple of times and could not fault the taste or presentation.    We booked treatments in the Spa during our stay and were both glad we did. We both had a traditional Hamman followed by an hour long massage which I cannot recommend highly enough. The hotel offer a free taxi shuttle service to and from the main square numerous times a day/night and they‚Äôre never late.    Finally the staff‚Ä¶    They were incredible really friendly exceptionally polite and so helpful. They clearly care about their hotel always checking everything is okay the manager of the hotel spoke to us daily (as he did with everyone) ensuring we were enjoying ourselves we even met the hotel owner on a couple of occasions who also spoke with all of the guests and ensured everything was okay.    On the day we were leaving our flight was not until early evening and we were due to checkout of our room at 12pm. Luckily nobody else was booked into our room after us reception kindly phoned our room in the morning to advise we could keep the room until we leave for no extra charge what a lovely unprompted gesture.    In summary this is an exceptional hotel with amazing staff I would highly recommend the Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa we will definitely go back.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adampS9231TL
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Khadijah P wrote a review Jul 2018,50,Beautiful and relaxing resort,From the minute we walked in my husband and I were greeted with fresh mint tea. This was nice as we had just arrived from the airport after waiting hours to pass through security. We were escorted to our room. We booked the suite with the private pool as I am someone who loves to swim but require privacy. This room was everything we needed and more. I loved the big windows modern look and the bathroom was so spacious. The breakfast was delicious with lots of options - the juices are the best part!! The restaurant dinner food was also good but I preferred the lunch menu. The spa service was also a delight. I booked a rose facial and my face felt so clean and refreshed afterwards. All the products used were natural.  The staff were also nice however we did not have much interaction with them. We would return again for a relaxing vacation.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/khadijahp2018
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,NehaBasia123 wrote a review Jul 2018,40,Nice BUT failed to keep up with their promise!,Overall our stay at the hotel had been rather pleasant however I would like to share the lack of customer interest once we had checked out. We were due to fly back to London at 2200hrs hotel check out time was 1200hrs. Upon booking our trip and stay we made contact with the hotel and confirmed they would be able to accommodate us by allowing us to have a room at least till 1500hrs hence why proceeded with our booking. At 1200hrs the day of our departure we were told by reception staff that we had to vacate the room no later than 1230hrs. As you can imagine this did not leave us enough time to pack our belongings and sort ourselves out prior to our departure. As we were left with no choice but to checkout by 1230hrs so we headed to the reception to pay off our room balance there was a male wearing causal shirt and sunglasses indoors who seemed to be a manager. This male did not even introduce himself but was very quick to take our payment without taking any interest and asking how our stay was. Considering it is a ...* hotel you would expect staff especially in management to ask about the welfare of their customers even the most standard hotels in London (Travelodge) check that their customers visit was okay and up to standard. It was clear that once they put money they did not care.    However we met with the hotel owner a day before departure and he stopped to introduce himself and ask how our stay has been so far and asked if we were happy with how we had been treated during our visit which we thought was very nice of him.  Other than this the hotel is of a high standard although on day on of our stay we had an infestation of files which was quickly resolved by housekeeping and is understandable given that it is a hot country.    Food - No complaints about the food.  Price - Everything was priced well.  Shuttle - They offer a free shuttle service throughout the day into town.  Housekeeping - Was up to standard.    As mentioned above overall our stay was pleasant it‚Äôs shame that it was ruined on the last day as they failed to keep up with their promise which resulted in us sitting around in the lounge area for 7 hours to kill time.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NehaBasia123
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,SE18Dweller wrote a review Jun 2018,40,Peaceful and relaxing,The headline says it all. It‚Äôs a lovely boutique hotel with friendly staff and a relaxing vibe so it‚Äôs well worth considering.    We booked here based on reviews and a good half board deal through a travel company. We‚Äôd stayed a short walk out of the Medina previously and wanted somewhere smaller and quieter this time and it met that requirement perfectly. Guests were a mix of French (highest proportion) British then selected others. We saw Arabic and German for example. There were also no young children there during our time until the last day.    Our stay was relaxing and hassle free. The hotel design is lovely. Just the right mix of style and tradition. There are also plenty of areas where you can sit and get some peace and quiet if you wish. Mercifully the only TVs were in the entertainment room so the World Cup games didn‚Äôt encroach if you didn‚Äôt want them to.    The rooms are spacious in good repair kept clean and have all you need. We had a villa with a little garden at the back but we didn‚Äôt use this as we just sat by the pool and then came in when we wanted. Hanging space was plentiful as were hangers and the wardrobe had a safe in it. WiFi was also at its strongest in the room although it can be picked up throughout the public areas. We found the WiFi to be patchy (on Samsung Apple and HTC devices). It would work fine then just stop. Switching network or refreshing the connection normally rectified this though. A member of staff also dropped round some additional water at about 7pm in the evening as well just in case you wanted more. I‚Äôm not sure why they wouldn‚Äôt just leave extra in the room when cleaning it but it was a nice touch nonetheless.    The pool area is clean and there are plenty of sunbeds. Some people bizarrely chose to get up early and reserve beds - a practice I think that should be made illegal - but there really was no need to.    We were on a half board basis but ate lunch in the restaurant most days too as there are no local restaurants within walking distance.    Breakfast was a mix of the usual things you‚Äôd find in a help yourself type hotel. We found the bread to be quite firm most days so toasting it was the only real option. There were an assortment of pastries hot foods pancakes meats cereal and fruits each day plus you could order eggs if you wanted them in a particular form. I ordered an omelette one day and it was well cooked. Beyond that there was a large selection of juices - the orange was freshly squeezed each day and delicious - plus tea and coffee. Whilst most people breakfasted quite late they were prompt clearing up at 10.30 so leave yourself enough time!    Dinner was probably the thing we felt has most room for improvement. There are choices of international and Moroccan foods and we tried to keep to the local dishes however it did all get a bit ‚Äòsamey‚Äô after 6 nights. We felt that they could have mixed it up a bit every couple of days or done a daily special.    We‚Äôd been to Marrakesh before and had some really tasty food that was well cooked and bursting with flavour from the deep spiciness and fresh ingredients but the hotel food was missing something. Some of the main courses didn‚Äôt come with couscous just being served on vegetables which we found odd (sides weren‚Äôt obviously orderable) and some lacked colour. We were left a little underwhelmed.    Don‚Äôt get me wrong the menu had some highlights. The starters were all delicious particularly the mini seafood pastilla and chicken ‚Äòwings‚Äô. The Thai style beef I had one night was also delicious. The other major plus is it isn‚Äôt a buffet. It‚Äôs all cooked to order so whilst it takes a bit longer to come out it‚Äôs all fresh and hot.    We kept to salads and shawarma for lunch which were good so there‚Äôs little to comment on. Desserts were also good when we had them but we were often too full after a shared starter and a main course each.    The other niggles about the restaurant are small but nonetheless there; if you were sitting out of direct line of sight of the waiters it often took too long to get the bill. We saw some guests got up to go and ask. The other is the table design. On some of the tables there was a large single base which meant you could stretch your legs out. Instead you had to spread them or twist to the side.    We can‚Äôt comment on the spa or gym as we didn‚Äôt use them. Nor did we try room service. We didn‚Äôt use the shuttle in to Marrakesh either but it ran regularly. It just so happened that we wanted to go and come back at times that didn‚Äôt sync up so we ordered a taxi (uber not available!) which was MAD300 return. The hotel has said they could organise and quoted 200 one way. It‚Äôs also possible to book trips through the hotel but we made our own arrangements on that front.    The one thing we found unnecessarily hard in our stay was our check in. We arrived 2 hours late thanks to easyJet - around 11.30pm - so we missed our first night‚Äôs meal. We were obviously also tired from travelling for so long. The chap on reception recognised that and asked if we wanted some food. We weren‚Äôt overly hungry so just asked for a salad or sandwich however he kept pushing us to have a larger meal. This was because we were half board and it represented good value but we just didn‚Äôt want it. In the end we said we didn‚Äôt want anything because that was just easier. He also chose to start a conversation with some guests returning in the shuttle halfway through serving us which we found a bit rude. Basically it took too long to check in and our bags arrived around 10 mins after we got to our room. Considering no one else was around and it was a 2 min walk we found that unnecessary. We were tired just wanted to have a wash and crash out after all.    A similar thing happened on our last day. We asked to have the lunch that we‚Äôd just eaten as the half board option as we were going out for dinner but the chap on reception (different one) said that we shouldn‚Äôt as he could see it wasn‚Äôt good value. Again I can understand the logic but when you persist with that and your guest keeps saying no that‚Äôs what we want to do you need to recognise when to give up or offer and alternate solution.    We enjoyed our week immensely. It was quiet relaxing hassle free and good value which is what we wanted. If you‚Äôre considering this type of break then the Siriyane fits that bill perfectly. The staff are friendly and the ambience was just what we wanted.    Please note that it isn‚Äôt close to any restaurants shops or places to walk to so if you want to wander out after dinner then this probably isn‚Äôt right for you.    All that said it‚Äôs worth noting the following as there is room for improvement and we‚Äôd suggest the following:  - Mix up the menu a bit during the week perhaps offering a daily special or a couple of specific ‚Äòthemed‚Äô evenings  - Top up the minibar or check it each day in each room. We ran out of cola and it wasn‚Äôt restocked. Since that was the day before we left we didn‚Äôt ask but that should just be the norm in 5*,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SE18Dweller

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,blue_roon wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Service is second to none.,We got an airport transfer to the hotel. This takes approx 15 minutes. You are lead away from main Marrakesh and what feels like a rural(ish) area. Don‚Äôt be alarmed though. When you arrive at the hotel you are confronted by a very nice and welcoming reception.    Note the airport takes an age to get through security there and back.    We were shown around the hotel and taken to our room. It was very clean and modern. I‚Äôm not sure why others have been so harsh I am a very picky person and I‚Äôm not sure what other negative comments have referred to in the slightest. The whole time we were there the hotel was being permanently cleaned.    In all honesty you could stay at the hotel and not leave to venture Marrakesh at all. The breakfast was lovely the lunch menu was good and the dinner menu not to our liking but was probably more for French/ Arabic tastes. We ordered off menu no issues whatsoever. In fact the staff could not do enough for us the whole time.    Used the spa facilities all good here.    The hotel/ bar staff were fantastic the shuttle driver took us for a tour of Marrakesh completely off his own back the managers were very approachable professional and nice.    In fact there is very little I can say negatively if anything at all. I would recommend probably more to couples. Business travellers too far away from main city families probably would be ok but definitely a place to go as a couple.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,AitchR wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Bliss!,We stayed here for a week commencing 19th May 2018 We stayed in a wonderful suite with private garden and large pool (room 122) and it was absolutely gorgeous. There is a large lounge area with settee coffee table and a bar with a large TV on the wall and patio doors leading onto the private garden/pool area with outside table and chairs. The bedroom was large spacious with a very comfortable bed. Again patio doors looking onto the pool. Leading through to the bathroom there were plenty of cupboard space and the bathroom was large too with a separate walk in shower a separate bath and toilet and two sinks. The best thing for us though were the amazing staff. To the driver that collected us from the airport to the reception staff the drivers of the free shuttle service into the city the lady cleaning our room to the pool man who arrived quickly to uncover the pool when asked in the morning and to cover it back up at night. The gardeners who were always busy tending to the lovely grounds and then to the hotel staff. To the managers who always greeted you and even the owner came and introduced himself to all the guests and to check we were happy with everything. To the bar staff who delivered the room service always with a smile they were always chatty and smiling. The waiting staff for suggestions on local delicacies. This leads me to our sincere thanks and appreciation to the Chefs the food is absolutely amazing. Breakfast is buffet style there is always plenty of choice along with cooked eggs. The evening meals were just wonderful and we can highly recommend the Monkfish Thai Curry it was that good we had it three nights out of seven!  If you are reading this and trying to decided whether to go to this hotel please trust me and just book it I promise you you will not be disappointed in any way.  There is a service charge added at the end but I believe this is instead of tipping individuals and this money is shared amongst all the staff.  Our sincere thanks to EVERYONE at the Sirayane you gave us the most relaxing holiday we have ever had and would dearly love to return.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,GraemeLancashire wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Beautiful place to rest just outside the city.,It's a small boutique place about 6 miles outside the city and quite isolated down a secluded road but better for that as it is so peaceful. They provided a free shuttle several times a day into the city so you don't miss out on the chaos there. The hotel is low rise with a few rooms above the main reception area then single storey appartments and villas all based around a lovely pool area and gardens one pool is heated whilst the other felt iced and a small kids pool. It is all stylishly done with good fittings furnishings and decor. Our room was a good size super comfy bed with super soft sheets and was cleaned and serviced to a high standard. The staff are excellent very friendly and accommodating even during their fasting period of Ramadan most speak at least 3 languages and to keep on top of things the owner seemed to be about most days and wanted personal feedback off you. Breakfast caters for all nationalities and is taken on a lovely terrace whilst evening meals are very good.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,trinity__97 wrote a review Apr 2018,40,"A good hotel, we would return",Overall this was a great small hotel. It is away from central Marrakech but there is a free shuttle to and from the centre plus we were taken to and from the airport by a very professional driver. They take security very seriously with every vehicle coming on site being checked for bombs underneath and visible security guards at night.    We were upgraded to a room with a semi-private garden this was a nice touch and meant we could flit between the room garden chairs and sun loungers/pool with ease.    The pool-guys provided exceptional service and seemed to anticipate your every whim I think they got annoyed if you tried to raise or lower an umbrella yourself. As soon as they saw someone walking to the pool they were there laying out towels for you and discretely cleared them away when you left for good in the afternoon. Their service was the best I have come across and better than I would expect in a 5* hotel.    The spa was good I had a very good Oriental massage. The lounge areas were nice with a nice roaring fire in the lounge on colder days. The WiFi was plentiful and with no hasslely logon procedures (being remote means no-one else would hijack it).    The biscuits in the room and small bottles of water each night were a nice touch. The shower was very good in the room too and an easy to use safe provided free of charge.    Breakfast was not your standard fare with there being no pork but there was lots of options both hot and cold. They would make omelettes and poached eggs to order with scrambled eggs being provided readily. Lots of choices of drinks.    The food was good in the evening very generous starters and puddings probably twice the size they need to be. Mains were also good but the Moroccan options lacked any side dishes. Very good chocolate mousse.    The reasons for not giving this a 5 star review:  - [main reason] Mediocre at best service in the restaurant. Fundamentally they employ at least twice as many bar/restaurant staff as they need to. They spend most of the time standing at the side of the room looking very bored or chat between themselves food and beverage manager included. Which would be fine if they noticed when you needed service and came over but instead you have to sit and wait an age for your finished plates to be cleared they never notice if your drink is finished and therefore don‚Äôt ask if you want a new one (a wasted opportunity to sell more drinks!) simple food can take an eternity to come out (e.g. 20min at lunch for just a scoop of ice cream). On 3 occasions simple requests were forgotten or got wrong (one wrong drinks order giving me a Bloody Mary not a Virgin Mary they did rectify this as let my husband keep the wrong drink for free it‚Äôs lucky I don‚Äôt drink alcohol out of choice not for religious or medical reasons)(twice we asked for ice with our water at dinner and didn‚Äôt get it). I get that you are on holiday and want a relaxed meal and perhaps time between courses but clearing away finished plates and offering more drinks is usually standard in even budget restaurants.  - some areas of the hotel were very dark a little more light in places in the restaurant and bar wouldn‚Äôt go amiss.  - no clue which were the ladies or gents toilets in the main lobby as there are no signs.    Despite these negatives we would stay again it is an excellent hotel and we had a relaxing stay.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bagshot, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trinity__97
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Billyarcher wrote a review Apr 2018,50,Always a pleasure - 4th trip,We have just returned from an Easter Break to the Sirayane. We stayed in room 119 which had a decent sized pool and private Garden. The room itself was high quality and had separate areas for our children to sleep. It was very spacious.  It is slightly off the beaten track which may catch you out when you first visit. That said the airport transfer was only about 20 minutes - which takes some beating. It is quiet and has a laid back charm. We have been there 4 times because the staff are helpful and friendly. My son and daughter often want something cooked slightly differently as many kids do - every time it is accommodated with grace. The owner Medhi is hands on and keen to engage his customers which we admire very much. If you want to visit somewhere where the staff don‚Äôt care this is not for you. It‚Äôs a welcoming break away from life‚Äôs worries and for any of our friends and families we would highly recommend.

The owner (who introduces himself to you) manager & the very attentive staff could not have done more to ensure that we had a wonderful stay. Our spacious room had great views of the snow capped Atlas mountains the two swimming pools (one which is heated) & the surrounding countryside. The room was luxurious the king size bed extremely comfortable.  The buffet style breakfast had plenty of choice & could be eaten either inside or outside on the sun soaked terrace likewise lunch. The food was delicious.  The Hotel runs a free shuttle to & from Marrakesh which is extremely reliable.  Everything about the Sirayane was just perfect & we would thoroughly recommend it to everyone; we could not find fault with anything.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,LondonRHA wrote a review Mar 2018,40,Great location just outside the city.,"Firstly Pros - Very nice hotel away from the main city so nice and quiet which added to the great nights' sleep. The bed is of good quality too.    The reception and restaurant/bar staff were extremely friendly and attentive. Great service and would do anything to help. What I would expect from a hotel priced as it is.    The shuttle service to and from the main city which the hotel provides is very convenient and safe.    The food for lunch/dinner was of great quality.    Secondly Cons - OVERPRICED. Service charge is added to absolutely everything. So be aware that a lot of the final bill will have been service charge. If a particular service warrants it I will add tip - if not then I wont. For a hotel in this price range I don't want to feel like just because I am a westerner that I have endless supplies of money. To top it off on departure day we were told that the use of steam room and showers would be available to use before we left the hotel to go to the airport. Alas when we used it were presented with another bill (plus service..) for the privilege. Again for the price of the hotel the spa facilities should br free to use just like any other ""5 star"" hotel.",Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LondonRHA

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Frances P wrote a review Feb 2018,50,A relaxing end to our stay in Morocco,After a busy 10 day trip we chose this hotel to relax in and it was perfect. Very modern in design with distinctively local touches. A warm welcome from Youssef and other staff including a visit from the owner who was keen to know how everyone was. We were upgraded to a superior room with a private garden which was very nice although still handy for the heated pool. A very varied menu even for the half board option which was excellent value so we could mix Moroccan and International cooking. Good breakfast buffet with self service. And I enjoyed my deluxe Hamman experience after chickening out of the rural version in the mountains. The regular shuttle into town apparently takes 15 minutes and it's no further than that to the airport so convenient when you find it although our non-local taxi driver needed my phone GPS to get there as it's in an area south of the city which has been earmarked for hotel and upmarket residential development and still has lots of empty space. Might be worth checking for nearby building works when you book if you're fussy.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,CautiouslyOptimistic wrote a review Jan 2018,40,Third visit and I'll keep going back here,Having stayed here twice before I was really nervous about coming back again. There's always a worry that you won't have the same experience as the last time or things will have changed for the worse when you visit the same hotel. I was so glad to see things at the Sirayane are still excellent.    The hotel has spent some money doing some upgrades to the rooms such as new TV systems which are really good even if they are a little temperamental. You can still borrow DVDs from reception if you have issues with the TV. I think this is because the hotel is still struggling a little with broadband speeds/WiFi systems although this has definitely improved from my first visit. The rooms are kept very clean although they need to keep the wooden furniture well cared for to make sure the look of the room doesn't fade.    The gardens remain immaculate the sports bar pool table is now free (which was a pleasant surprise) the pool is as delightful as always as is the spa and gym but they still haven't managed to invest in some better tennis rackets and they really need to.    The staff once again make your stay spectacular. They are so attentive kind and passionate about making sure you are enjoying your stay. I'm glad to say that this doesn't appear to be just because I've been a returning guest as other people staying at the hotel for the first time felt the same.    The breakfast is still an OK standard offering a really good range of foods but don't expect a western hot breakfast as you know it. Hot food is on offer but it has a North African twist. Lunch and room service offerings were still good but I'm sad to see they haven't added ice cream or ice lollies to their menu which would be amazing when it's hitting 40 degrees.    I'll definitely be going back again. It's comfortable well maintained pretty and has excellent service a true oasis from the nearby manic medina.,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CautiouslyOptimistic
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,ClaRS wrote a review Jan 2018,40,Lovely Hotel - excellent service,I spent a wonderfully relaxing week at the hotels. I loved the architectural look and feel of the hotel. The impressively high ceilings that greeted one when one arrives at the hotel invokes an atmosphere of luxury and mystic. This was accompanied by a warm and heartfelt welcome by the evening reception staff. This efficient and yet endearing service continued in all departments and during my whole stay. The rooms were beautifully comfortable with great cable TV choice. The Breakfast on the lovely terrace offered everything one needed to start a day.  My only reservations concerned the restaurant. The dining room itself seemed a bit improvised - as if it should have been a lounge and someone had placed 4 tables in it. Not very cosy - on some nights it was even very cold. The food is in my opinion over priced and not particularly good. The accompaniment for the tajine never arrived the chicken medallion was awfully dry the Large Caesar Salad (that was definitely not large)  lacked the iconic ingredients that define a Caesar and finally the spaghetti was so over-cooked that it was on the verge of falling apart.  The shuttle service into town was dependent and very welcome. For those who get peckish afternoons or late nights there is unfortunately no kiosk or patisserie to buy a either bag of crisps some fruit or just to sit and enjoy a sandwich or Moroccan pastries for miles.,Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/460clars

We arrived late in the evening and the check in staff offered us some beautiful tea and refreshments whilst they checked us in which was very much welcomed after a long journey. Everything in the hotel has a stylish and luxury feel about it and nothing was too much trouble for the staff during our stay.    Whilst dining in the restaurant the manager came and spoke to us offered his recommendations and tips for an enjoyable trip to Marrakech. It was a really personal service.    The rooms were incredibly comfortable with fantastic showers and facilities.    We were after a relaxing holiday away from the hussle and bustle and this was exactly what we wanted. The hotel offered a free return shuttle into the centre of Marrakech and the staff were helpful when it came to helping us book other excursions.    The pool was great and the loungers were incredibly comfortable.    My only regret was not booking a room with a private pool!

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,_mahwishsn wrote a review Jan 2018,50,Classy & Charming,I stayed with my mum at the Sirayane Boutique. Just a little treat for us to spend some quality time together. The hotel is a 15 minute drive from the airport which is great! We arrived at the Hotel and were greeted by a charming man Yousef who made us feel welcome. We were given mint tea and biscuits which was a very nice gesture after our journey. Yousef showed us around the hotel but didn't spend too long showing us around just the right amount of time. Mum wanted the prayer times for Marrakesh Yousef kindly printed out the timetable. We were given an upgrade to the mini suite with garden. It was a lovely size room with comfortable beds and 2 sofas. It gave the feel of a small apartment because it was a very good size. The owner of the hotel came to introduce himself and welcome us to his hotel which is was very nice. The only thing I didn't like was that the shower had no door its a walk in shower which does look nice but would like a bit of privacy. And the shower area does not have a hook to hang your towel etc there are hooks on the wall opposite the shower; could possibly be on the same side as the shower. The rooms were regularly cleaned and topped up with water bottles biscuits and toiletries. There was some work going on outside the hotel but we were not disturbed by it. The pool area is so nice and the pool boy was so attentive and so helpful. We enjoyed the subtle music being played outside it was bliss. We spent 2 days of going to the Atlas Mountains so it was so nice to come back to the hotel each evening to our beautiful room and have a good night sleep. The beds are so comfortable! Breakfast is amazing we were spoilt for choice! And the staff were so helpful and professional. The lunch and dinner menu was a good choice of options. We had dinner there 2 evenings and thoroughly enjoyed it is slightly more on the pricey side to what you would pay in the Square . The hotel is a 20 to 25 minute drive from the busy Square and their is a shuttle service which is one of the reasons why I booked this hotel. The drop off and pick up is very easy in terms of location and time. However it would be good if the shuttle was a little more regular. We had facial treatments done at the hotel they were lovely and a beautiful setting. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay! We left feeing happy and I am so glad I booked the Sirayane.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Adele L wrote a review Jan 2018,10,Worst stay since forever,We have expected so much more based on the great previous reviews available on the TripAdvisor however the reality we faced was rather different. Our experience was light years away from 5* service we got familiar with while staying in different hotels throughout our travels in Asia Europe and Americas.    Yes it‚Äôs clean and freshly remodeled. But that is there the advantages end.  The actual location is different from the coordinates they put on Google. It is not 3kilometers from Marrakech but more like 8kilometers away.    While the service personnel is well trained and pleasant and I can give only positive feedback there are a few things to point out. For example we had to wait for the hot water in a shower for at least 10 minutes (I wish I was exaggerating) our room was located on the second floor maybe that is what influenced it. I tried to point it out to the general manager when we approached us during breakfast but he cut me off mid-sentence and said ‚Äúwe will take care of this‚Äù without hearing out the complete problem.    The restaurant food was simply abysmal. It‚Äôs not like we expected Michelin star restaurants on grounds but what we have been served was ridiculous. The menu is eclectic ‚Äì supposed to be Asian and French Italian and Marrocan meals ‚Äì a total mash up. We had a full dinner there + room service and tried multiple meals. Only the chocolate fondant was ok. How can you ruin a Caprese salad? Well simply serve it with spoiled and rock hard Mozzarella. The chef should be replaced asap.    The owner of this place keeps attacking guest on site fishing for compliments and insults everyone here in Tripadvisor who have the courage not to be polite and describe everything as it is.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Claire H wrote a review Dec 2017,40,Solid choice for a boutique hotel away from the hustle and bustle of Marrakesh,So first the pros ...    - The staff are absolutely amazing. Very welcoming friendly willing to help with any query. I even had one member of staff make me a special tea as I wasn't feeling well.  - This hotel is a good location if you want to be out of the hustle and bustle of Marrakesh but close enough to go in for a meal or to visit some of the attractions.  - The food was excellent. Every meal I had was delicious and well prepared.    The ok bits:  - The spa was ... interesting! I had an Indian head massage which was the strangest massage that I've ever had. I don't think she knew what she was doing! I would have rather them say that they couldn't cater for it. But the facial was excellent and my skin really felt rejuvenated afterwards.  - The main pool area was lovely apart from the main pool being unheated and the incessant music that played all day. I understand that Marrakesh is hot in the summer so an unheated pool is probably very welcome. But it seems crazy not to heat the pool in the winter so that guests can enjoy it. And there is no need to play music all day. It just adds to the general noise and it's much nicer to hear the birds singing (when you can hear them over the construction work - see below).    The cons:    - It is not a quiet hotel. There was a fairly constant construction noise during the day. This was really disappointing for me as I had come here to relax and at one point I had to put earplugs in just to drown out some of the noise. This was in the middle of the day.  - The room size ... I stayed in a junior suite and I was disappointed at the lack of seating area inside. I know that in a nice place like Marrakesh most people will want to sit outside but it is also nice to have somewhere other than the bed to relax. Having had a look at the bigger suites which had quite a good sized seating area I certainly wouldn't pay to have a junior suite again.  - The pool / garden area of the suite was also disappointing. The pool itself was lovely and so nice to have some private space to yourself. However the pool only got partial sun til about 2pm and then was in shade the rest of the day - as was the rest of the garden area. And I use the word 'garden' loosely. While there were plants most of the ground was dirt with a little grass.    Overall I have marked this hotel as 'very good'. I think the pros do outweigh the cons because the staff and food are so wonderful. But I'm not sure that I would stay here again in the same suite. And I would double-check when the construction work is over.,Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CEGH

I also wouldn‚Äôt say the hotel food was that expensive (yes compared to central Marrakesh) but in terms of a hotel no and the lamb is to die for.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,PawelJZ wrote a review Nov 2017,50,Quiet and relaxing hotel on the outskirts of Marrakech,Sirayane Boutique Hotel and Spa must be one of the best hotels on the outskirts of Marrakech. This privately run establishment is a perfect place for relaxing and unwinding after visiting the medina of Marrakech. The hotel runs a very convenient free shuttle service to the city centre and back which is a great option for those wishing to explore the historical places in Marrakech wonder around the souks or simply going out for a drink or dinner. The hotel itself is a modern property with some lovely and stylish design. Rooms are really spacious and comfortable and as one would expect from a five star property they are equipped with good quality bed linen bathrobes toiletries coffee/tea making facilities etc. There are two good-sized swimming pools (one of them is heated in winter) and plenty of sun loungers. The staff is very professional - friendly helpful and discreet. I had a great time staying in Sirayane Boutique and would love to visit again in not to distant future.,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Poznan, Poland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PawelJZ
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Larbe wrote a review Nov 2017,50,Best kept secret-highly recommended,This has to be one of Marrakech‚Äôs best kept secrets. This boutique hotel is full of warmth and very welcoming. Nothing is too much trouble. Food is very good. Be warned they have a strange version of Caesar salad.. but still very enjoyable. Although a little bit out of the way it is a fabulous place to get away from the hustle bustle and pollution of the city. The rooms are comfortable and the garden rooms are perfect for privacy and space. We have decided to try the suite next year with private pool. A great unpretentious find enabling us to relax and unwind.,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"St. Albans, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Larbe

After spending 4 nights in the city we were looking forward to chilling by a pool. On arrival you walk through the biggest doors I've seen and into the beautiful surrounds of the hotel. We were given a room with a semi private garden looking out onto the pool. The room was HUGE and very comfortable. The whole surrounds felt very luxurious and peaceful. The breakfast in the hotel was great with a huge amount of choice. We ate each night in the hotel and the food was very good. It was so hot when we were there so being able to sit outside in the gardens at dinner was perfect. The staff were all very attentive and the owner himself came to introduce himself. The facilities are very good with an onsite spa tennis courts pool room and free shuttle into the city. In the day the pool man makes up your favourite bed by the pool and even came round throughout the day to move the umbrella so my boyfriend had shade all day!

We arrived to a friendly welcome including a complimentary mint tea. Room was clean and spacious. This is a small boutique hotel and this enables the hotel to focus on service and performance.    I have stayed in a very large number of hotels around the world and the service at the Sirayana has not been bettered anywhere. Staff are incredibly attentive. A good example is the pool team who constantly ensuring our sun beds were shaded by the parasols.    The breakfast team were amazing with nothing being too much trouble.    Although there is just one restaurant the food is really excellent. They offer both local dishes as well as the usual standards.

I would rate it 4.5 only because it has not a bath.  Hotel amenities: 5 stars. We loved the hotel atmosphere and enjoyed the swimming pool. Only drawback is possibly the fact that the hotel is a bit hard to find.  Service: 5 stars everyone was smiling and eager to make our stay as enjoyable as possible.

A big shout out to the Managers Breakfast team dinner team reception staff pool boy cleaners spa team and anyone else who I have missed. Was also a nice touch meeting the owner of the hotel who was ver nice.    We stayed in the junior suite which was lovely with our own private garden and the hotel pool is very nice and we enjoyed relaxing by the pool.    All of the staff helped make our holiday and we had a lovely time.    Sirayane hotel is about 10 minutes from Marrakech. We picked the hotel for this reason and it is a lovely balance of having a relaxing stay at the hotel or taking the free shuttle into busy Marrakech at our leisure.    Would highly reccomend this hotel for couples looking to have a relaxing romantic holiday.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Jane H wrote a review Oct 2017,50,Pure relaxation,We booked The Sirayanne because of all the fabulous reviews on here. We booked both flight and hotel through BA and on arrival at Marrakech Menara Airport we walked outside and immediately saw the driver for the Sirayanne Hotel. Within 10~15minutes we arrived at the Sirayanne 2 great big wooden doors opened and we were met by reception who ushered us in sat us down and brought us some Moroccon tea. Our bags and cases were taken straight to our room. The receptionist then showed us to our room showing us around the hotel as we went. We freshened up and went to dinner. The menu has both international dishes and Moroccan choices. The waiters can not do enough for you this is basically the theme of the hotel every member of staff will go out of their way for you.  The pool area has beds around the pool the pool chap will suddenly be there with towels for you he‚Äôll lay them out on the beds for you and make any adjustments you need and will ensure the sun umbrella is exactly where you want it. Every morning he would have our sun bed just how we liked it with extra pillows and pillows propped up he‚Äôd do this before we even went to breakfast! Throughout the day there is always someone there to provide towels and assist with the umbrella again nothing is too much trouble. The waiters from the bar/restaurant walk round the pool frequently taking and delivering drink orders they collect the empties as they go so everywhere is spotlessly clean.  The breakfast menu is extensive there is fresh fruit and meats cereals and milk pastry‚Äôs hot foodthen you can order an omelette or fried eggs! And again the waiters will assist in bringing you tea/coffee to your table outside on the terrace which is where all the meals are taken. In an evening we‚Äôd still be sat having our evening meal gone past 9pm the weather was superb and I was sat out in just a short sleeved top as it was lovely and warm. I‚Äôm a cold person but never wore long sleeves once.  Our accommodation was with our own private garden which was situated exactly where my husband had asked in an earlier email to the hotel. The rooms are spotless and spacious our bathroom just had a shower but I think there are rooms with baths if preferred. The bed was so comfortable and big! If like us you like your tea or hot drinks then you‚Äôre best to take you‚Äôre own tea bags and ask a waiter for a jug of milk we were constantly asking reception for milk which they always brought but we found it easier with a jug of milkthey don‚Äôt have milk in their tea so is a tad odd to them. But anything you want the staff at the Sirayane will provide. The bar/restaurant manager and the owner are both very friendly and ask every day if everything is ok! If it‚Äôs not ok they will try to put it right! We‚Äôd met the owner the day before whilst we were sat waiting our turn in the spa. The following night at dinner he asked how our spa session had been! The fact he‚Äôd remembered us was one thing but for him~the owner to remember we‚Äôd had a spa session speaks volumes about the hotel!  Everything about the hotel was superb from arrival to checkout! I have some mobility issues and can‚Äôt walk very far this hotel is superb there are a few steps down to the pool area but if someone came in a wheelchair I know the staff would go out of their way to help you.  I know where I want to spend next years holiday and with only 3 1\2 hours flight time you can keep the Canaries for winter sun it‚Äôs the Sirayane in Marrakesh for us.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Wiltshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jsh295

The hotel is lovely and peaceful guests all seem to have a similar outlook and there is not much noise at all.    Sun loungers are super comfy and the pool just the right temperature to cool down and have a swim!    My room was also great- a lovely size and well decorated.    Staff were very helpful and attentive but not too obtrusive - the perfect combo!    A few minor gripes - the food in the evenings was disappointing the quality didn't match with the rest of the standards of the hotel. also I had a spa treatment which although it left my skin feeling nice and soft was not the most relaxing experience- the therapist kept on walking in and out of the room and there was an awful lot of banging and crashing as she prepared the different creams- no chance of falling asleep during that massage!

Our room 103 was excellent above the restaurant and bar with a good balcony and view over the gardens and pools. Service was good and the staff including the manager and owner had good personalities. Food was excellent with a good varied menu and drink was fine and essential because of the very high temperatures. It was very relaxing and atmospheric having all meals and drinks sitting outside with the garden and pool view. The gardens and the pools are very appealing and the pool bed service was excellent. The only limitation is that the comfortable pool beds are flat and sitting up around the pools is difficult. As a flat sunbather that did not bother me at all.

Mention has to be made of the staff. Nothing is too much trouble. From the pool man who seems to anticipate your every need the cleaners who always greet you with a smile and 'bonjour' to the waiting staff who remember that you have half still and half sparking water with your meal.

The Pool Boy was attentive and made sure that customers were not disturbed too much by others.    Breakfast was a highlight and set us up for the day. We ate dinner on most evenings and enjoyed the Moroccan cuisine although other options were available. Drinks could be ordered from the pool side.    We enjoyed a relaxing massage. Outstanding!

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,suhfoodie wrote a review Aug 2017,50,Glad we found it....,It was by pure chance that we stumbled across this hotel. It stood out and had everything we were looking for.    Before even getting to Marakkech we made contact with the hotel and they were quick to reply. They booked excursions for us arranged the spa and our private transfer from the airport. Already a plus point with quick communication.    When we arrived at the airport Hicham our driver had been patiently waiting for us.  The journey to the hotel was around 10minutes and was very pleasant.    When we arrived at Sirayane there is a quick security check of the vehicle before entering. First impressions are the last and wow were we amazed. The door itself was huge.  We were greeted by Rachid and instantly made to feel welcome. We sat in the reception area and were served Moroccan tea & biscuits. We then had a quick tour and was shown our room as it was ready. The room was WOW. It was the junior suite with private garden & pool.  They had put rose petals over the bathroom & bed and there was complimentary water fruit & biscuits.    We had a spa session booked in at 11-1pm but due to security at the airport as there were long queues we arrived just before 12. The ladies in the spa were very accommodating and we had chosen to still have our traditional hamam.  It was an amazing experience. Very professional and very relaxing. Glad we had our skin exfoliated at the beginning of our holiday.    The hotel runs a free shuttle service to the town square so we opted to take the 5pm one.    We relaxed in our pool and ordered lunch from the restaurant to our room (extra charge) but it was all about having a different experience on holiday.  The food cane quick and was very nice.    We jumped on the shuttle (same driver) over the the 3 nights - very professional & courteous and informative.    Our first evening we had shesha delivered to our room also.    Breakfast was served from 7:30am always fresh and lots of choice.  Our driver for the excursion arrived at 9am (none of the drivers were ever late).    The hotel is pure bliss it's quiet and amazing to escape the hustle & bustle of the city. Anything we needed was dealt with quickly & professionally and reservations were made at restaurants in the city when we need them to be.    I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. It's worth the upgrade to a suite with a pool (although I've never seen the main pool full).    Rachid from reception is a pure asset to this hotel.  We would definitely book here again if we returned to Marakkech.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,soniaguk wrote a review Aug 2017,40,Oasis of peace and tranquillity but not a 5*!,We stayed at Sirayane for a week. The hotel is close to the airport but away from the Medina. The reception area is amazing. We were welcomed with refreshing mint tea and given information about the hotel facilities etc. Then advised to wait until 2PM to get our room which was okay as we just relaxed in the pool and bar area    Our room was superb; we had a garden suite with access to the pool. The room was always kept very clean. Room service (at a charge!) was good. They even charge for a Moroccan Mint Tea (which is given free at most hotels!)    Food: Breakfast was good but no Moroccan breakfast just the usual cereals bread cheese pancakes and you can ask for fresh omelettes. Lunch and dinner is expensive and not much choice but then there are no restaurants around the hotel and if you are not going to the Medina you have to eat at the hotel. Best to take the shuttle and eat at some restaurant in the Medina.    Swimming pool is nice and clean with views of the Atlas Mountains    Location: The hotel provides free shuttle to medina (about 20 mins each way) and few times per day. It always felt so peaceful to return to the hotel after a visit to the bustling Medina!    The tours and excursions organised by the hotel are super expensive    The hammam and massage in the hotel was simply great and the staff there was very friendly.    Some hotel staff members are really helpful like Rachid at the main reception and our shuttle driver Raashid but apart from that can't say much about the others!,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soniaguk

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,lmm10_12 wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Fantastic time,I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anybody looking for a relaxing holiday. It was an oasis of peace and everything was taken care of. It is a 15 minute drive from Marrakesh itself but there is a free minibus service that runs regularly. We used to spend our days by the pool and then go into the centre in the evening to experience the hubbub of Moroccan life. Having said that we ate at the hotel a couple of times when we had been out for the day and the food there was very good.  We had a mini suite with garden which backed onto the pool and was very convenient. The room was big and spotless and contained everything we needed. There was plenty of drinking water available and we had little Moroccan cakes/biscuits in the room every day.  The thing that made the holiday for us though were the staff - from the managers down. Everyone was so helpful and obliging and we really appreciated the help from the pool boys in keeping us out of the direct sun!!,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lmm10_12

The Sirayane Boutique was in a quiet area but a good location not too far from attractions (water park souk). We were given a room upgrade on arrival and it was only up from there. Our room had a private garden that backed on to the beautiful hotel grounds and pool. There was a games room which had TVs to watch football a bar and pool table. We had hammam baths at the spa which were absolutely amazing and incredibly refreshing. The breakfast was first class as were the hotel menus for lunch and dinner.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,junho255 wrote a review Jul 2017,50,"Wonderful, Tranquil and Relaxing Paradise close to town",Hi potential traveller. So you want to know what Sirayne is like? I‚Äôll be honest and frank in this review.    My experience was a special one as it was my babymoon and all we wanted was a short weekend break without much activity but good facilities where we could relax in peace without much disturbance from other guests. This resort is very personal and you get to know everyone (as you can see from my pictures). It only has around 30 odd rooms making this resort very secluded and tranquil and not your party hotel in town. The clientele when we went was couples of all ages one or two families with kids around 7-10 as well as a few younger guests who mainly spent time out in town. The nationalities that were there were usually French German English and a couple from other parts of Europe.  The hotel is around 15 minutes from town and there are shuttle buses that operate directly from the hotel otherwise you can take a taxi for 100 dirhams. Being a bit further out it had the luxury of space. The hotel bar had a lot of seating areas as well as more private areas if you like to sit and read a book. There was plenty of room within their dining area and you could get a great view of the pool and resort from their outside terrace. The food in the restaurant is good which gives you peace of mind as it was not the cheapest (although I believe this would be the case in any hotel). I would highly recommend the cous cous! There were plenty of wines and other spirits available making enabling them to make any alcoholic beverage I asked for.    One of the key draws of this resort is the pool. The main pool has a spectacular setting from the main hotel which is well kept throughout the day. We upgraded our room which came with a swimming within our apartment which great if you didn‚Äôt want to move far from the bed! Inside the rooms the bathroom was very modern and clean and the bed was comfortable. The other critical factor at this resort is the staff. I believe everyone I met was genuinely friendly and kind and wanted to help where possible. All in all a fantastic resort to really relax and chill.    We went in May and so it really was hot (around 40 degrees) so having a relaxed atmosphere with a great pool perfect weather and accommodating staff really made this a special trip! Thank you Sirayne! I would recommend the horse and carriage ride in town!,Date of stay: May 2017,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/junho255
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Doreen-Allen wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Exceptional customer service and great location; Home from Home!,Traveled with a friend and on arrival we were greeted with Moroccan mint tea and luxury biscuits as the front of house staff Aimad checked us in. He escorted us to our room and showed us the hotel grounds too etc which gave our stay that personal touch from the start. Throughout our stay the staff were friendly and very professional and once again provided that personal touch given that it is a boutique hotel - fewer guests and thus gives that feel of home away from home. Also the hotel manager comes up to say hello to each new guest on their first night to ensure that they are happy and comfortable with their stay so far etc which shows great concern and respect for guests. Nothing was ever too much for the staff - always willing to help and they went that extra mile to do so!    The breakfast selection was fantastic and always plentiful regardless of whether you came down 10mins to end of service or 7.30am. Great choice of foods both Moroccan and international cuisine for lunch and dinner and thus one always had a choice of foods.    Also the hotel offers a free return shuttle bus in to the city centre which one has to reserve at reception. It is about 15mins drive in to the centre which makes the hotel location ideal away from the hassle and buzzle of the city centre which I greatly value.    I will most definitely come back to Morocco and will most likely stay at the hotel once again if the time comes!,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Middlesex,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Doreen-Allen
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,SPdiner wrote a review Jul 2017,30,Disappointing,We chose this hotel because it had so many good reviews and trip advisor awards but we did not find it to be perfect for us. many reviewers raved about their rooms and the view from the balcony we were unlucky to be allocated a room with a view of barren desert land disappointing. The staff proudly showed us how many television programmes we could get and that WiFi was available in the rooms but not our room. When we asked about why we could not get any programmes through their sky connection we were told that it was down to Morocco internet service. Don't offer what you can't deliver. We tried the hot breakfast an on the first morning however it was too cold to enjoy so went for the cold offerings. There are no side plates for bread/croissants you can only have a large plate laid out for hot food. I enjoyed the fruit salad but when I asked for a spoon to eat the chopped fruit salad I was told they did not have spoons! so had to eat with the fork provided on the table. This a 5 star hotel. Have stayed in many 5 star hotels and the benefit is usually the niceties and thoughtfulness of these small things that make a hotel great. Sorry Sirayane not 5 star in my book! On the positive side the pool was lovely and very attentive pool staff and the hotel staff were very polite even when they did not address my complaints about the TV and WiFi service.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Oakhill, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SPdiner

The hotel was as charming as we remembered and many of the same staff as 2 years before. If you want to stay somewhere peaceful green and airy but only 10 mins outside Marrakesh itself I would highly recommend this hotel. It is luxurious without being ostentatious friendly and attentive without ever being intrusive. Staying with older teenagers and we all found what we wanted.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,crawleyhome wrote a review May 2017,50,Silver wedding,I booked this hotel as a treat for our Silver Wedding and to treat ourselves and we were not disappointed. The room was lovely strewn with rose petals when we arrived and the facilities to make a decent sized much needed cup of coffee. The food is fabulous and we ate in the garden outside dining area for every meal. We would recommend the private tour arranged through the hotel a bit more expensive than the travel company offers but well worth it. Do not feel obliged to buy anything from the shops that you may be steered into concentrate on the knowledge that the guide passes on. We bumped into the owner on the day of our Silver Wedding Anniversary after the tour and on the way to the bar for a cold drink - he asked if everything was ok and if it was a special occasion and told him it was. When we ordered two cokes the waiter came over and said that the owner was sending a glass of champagne each!! On our last day we had 8 hours between leaving the room and being picked up for the airport. The owner gave us free coffee and the morning and evening waiters gave us free coffee as a gift from themselves. Lovely feel tranquil quiet and relaxing. The free shuttle bus was good a good range of departures and returns and on time too. The hotel is quiet luxurious (fluffy slippers and dressing gowns and quality toiletries) and away from the hustle and bustle this is the one.,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crawleyhome

He has Asperger's so although he wanted to experience somewhere completely different and outside Europe I was keen that the hotel was a calm retreat at the end of a day exploring. Sirayane provides exactly that. Staff so helpful and answered all my questions pre trip promptly and politely and helped me to book the excursions we wanted so we knew the trip was all planned and as stress free as possible.  Had great fun playing 'Top Gear' in dune buggies and a fantastic guided tour around the city. City tour had the usual stop offs at certain shops or stalls to be plied with mint tea and endure a heavy sell but that's to be expected really and everyone was polite whether you bought in the end or not. I'm too British to enjoy haggling so probably spent too much!  Loved how there's a comfy sunbed for every guest with fabulous bright orange beach towels brought out as soon as you start to hover nearby. Food and drink quite expensive (comparable to English hotel prices) but good quality and nice mix of Moroccan and European. Menu might start to seem limited after a while but we only stayed 3 mights so no problem.  Architecture of the hotel is amazing and the scale of the reception room is a real wow when you first arrive having survived the queueing systems at Marrakech airport (leave yourself plenty of time before your return flight)  All in all we loved it and all fancy coming back some time,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelenP2244

The pool area was well looked after and the pool boys really looked after us - they even reserved us two loungers on our last day which was very kind as we had not even asked for that.

The location is good and it is a quick drive to the Medina. We just used the hotel taxi and they were always on time. They picked us up exactly where we were dropped off and when we wanted to come back early they came straight away.    The food is nice and the waiters (Zidane Salah and crew) really looked after us.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Madeleine G wrote a review Apr 2017,40,Relaxing oasis in Marrakech,My boyfriend and I stayed at Sirayane for four nights this Easter and really have no complaints! It's a lovely hotel just 15 minutes from the city center with all the services you might want on a vacation.    There is a really nice pool area with two pools one heated and one not a bar and restaurant lounge areas and a full service spa but the hotel still has a very boutique intimate feeling. I think the hotel was full when we stayed there but still it was very quiet and calm and by the end of our stay we recognised most of the guests. I would say there were mostly couples and a few families with smaller children.    We ate at the restaurant which was perfectly fine for its purposes but being in Marrakech I would definitely recommend going into the city to enjoy some of its great dining options. The hotel offers a free shuttle a few times a day driven by a very nice driver which we used several times. This was a great service which we really appreciated as I think it's quite hard to get a hold of taxis. The hotel can also arrange a driver to drive you/pick you up for a fee of around 20euros if the shuttle times don't suit you.    The spa offers both massages and traditional Hammam treatments; we tried the package with 45 minutes of Hammam followed by an hour's massage (approx 800 mad) which was really amazing. I fell asleep during the massage which should give you an idea of how relaxing it was...    Would definitely recommend this hotel it really is great value for money! Very clean and well kept. I have to say however that what I was most impressed with was the staff who were so helpful friendly and attentive. The service ambition is very high and we felt so taken care of. A special thanks to Moustapha in the reception who helped us when one of the restaurants in town had lost our reservation and to the restaurant staff who really made such an effort to give us a good stay. The manager personally greeted us on our second day and was also there to say goodbye when we left you can tell that they take pride in their work at Sirayane!,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Stockholm, Sweden",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaddeG10
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Happilyeverwilliams wrote a review Apr 2017,50,"Fabulous, a luxurious treat",Dear Reader I am quite new to Trip Advisor so apologies as my visit to this fabulous hotel was 2 years ago - but it absolutely deserves a review .... so here we go .... The hotel is set in gorgeous grounds in a quiet location. The whole ambiance is refined and peaceful . There are Beautiful views of the Atlas Mountains from your sun bed and the outdoor dining area. It is breath taking. The decor is tastefully modern with a Moroccan twist. The whole complex is very low rise with a variety of different room types to choose from. This is a small boutique hotel and that is exactly what it delivers. Personal and individual service lots of space and a little oasis all rolled into one holiday experience. Nothing dominates or overwhelms you. You just feel wrapped in luxury. The warm welcome by all of the staff was delightful and they were always very accommodating. We were looked after by our waiters each and every day. They made us feel super special. The pool staff always had a smile for us. The hotel manager always made a point of checking that our stay was going well. Our room with a private pool was fabulous - in fact I cried when I saw it. It was like being in a film. The food was delicious (lots of choice even for my super fussy boyfriend) and the cocktails were scrummy. We also had our first introduction to the invigorating Hammam during our stay. What an experience. I highly recommend using the spa. Away from the hotel Marrakech centre is a must see. The shuttle bus ran every day at preset times. You had to book in advance - which we usually forgot to do but the centre is close enough to get a taxi in for a reasonable amount of money. In summary the hotel allows glorious 5 star chilled out time with the option of seeing an amazing culture and a totally unique city? Special mention to Zidane what a star. He looked after us every day and made us smile.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Patsy323 wrote a review Apr 2017,50,"Beautiful, relaxing and luxurious!",Have just returned from a fantastic 7 night holiday with my husband. We had a Junior Suite which had its own pool and garden and everything was perfect from the comfortable bed to the luxurious bathroom. The main swimming pool is set in delightful surroundings and everywhere in the hotel is an oasis of peace and tranquillity. The wonderful staff cannot do enough for you; there is even a staff member to move your sunshade for you as the sun moves around the pool! The food at the hotel is excellent and the waiting staff superb. All the staff are friendly and welcoming and nothing is too much trouble. A particular mention from us goes to Zidane and Salah but all the bar and waiting staff were excellent. The Spa is beautiful and the massage I received one of the best I have had. Cannot fault this beautiful hotel and we will definitely return. Well done to the owner and all the staff at Sirayane Boutique Hotel and Spa.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Vivek.S wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Excellent Relaxing Hotel,Just returned from a 7-nights holiday in this fantastic resort in Marrakech with the family. From the moment we arrived we were greeted with a warm welcome and refreshing sweet Moroccan mint tea. All the staff are so attentive and cannot do enough for you. Being a small hotel you are definitely spoilt with a personal touch and even the owner and assistant managers take time to talk to guests.  We chose this hotel based on the reviews from TripAdvisor and were not disappointed. The spa treatments (hammam and oriental massage) are out of this world and the food especially the traditional Moroccan cuisine is 5* fine dining. We had the Prestige room which is spacious enough for two adults and two teens overlooking the swimming pool and Atlas mountain.  Would we return to this hotel - absolutely but next time it would be for a long weekend without the kids for a relaxing and pampering time!

In deed the hotel is small tranquil staff are attentive with a spacious pool area. The room at the side of the pool was spacious however we did find the bed too hard for our liking. The Spa was excellent and the hotel shuttle bus works well. We took an escorted tour of Marrakesh Sayed was very good.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Gemma P wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Just Perfect Escape,We stayed for a week here as a couple in the rooms adjacent to the pool and it was just perfect. We arrived quite late at night and were provided with food and refreshments even though the kitchen was closed. The staff were so attentive at the pool at the bar in the restaurant but were never invasive. Room was spacious comfortable shower excellent and also separate to the toilet facilities. We were half board and the food was superb although we still went out some nights to the medina. The shuttle bus is a real bonus however not as frequent as we would have liked so we just got Taxis to and from - cost us around ¬£10. The beauty of this place is that you can just relax from the minute you arrive all the sites are nearby but you are just far enough away to be in a real oasis of calm. We did not use the spa on this occasion but we did make daily use of the gym - basic but has everything you would require. Would completely recommend and book again if we ever return to Marrakech - this would be my first choice of place.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/595gemmap
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,mirembeLondon wrote a review Mar 2017,50,"Absolutely fantastic hotel, literally flawless!",Wow! This place is quite simply amazing I'd read all of the reviews before we came so had high expectations but the hotel itself went above and beyond what we expected. The hotel itself is stunning very modern and sleek and incredibly comfortable but what makes this hotel stand out from anywhere else I've ever stayed is the staff. With only 28 rooms the staff can go above and beyond when it comes to personal service firstly there is a lot of them. From the moment we walked into the hotel and met Youssef the concierge to the moment we left we felt incredibly well looked after. On day 1 we chose a spot by the pool and every day after that the pool attendant made sure that we had the same spot. My mum is elderly and struggles with mobility so the pool attendant made sure there was also a chair and extra pillows for her and every day he would meticulously put them out. The staff in the restaurant were amazing Soufiane Zidane and Hamza took particularly good care of us again after day 1 they remembered how we liked our coffee and what juice we liked the extra attention to detail makes such a difference. Literally nothing was too much trouble. The owner came to check how we were every day and the manager did the same. We booked tours through the hotel and ended up getting taxis into Marrakech because that way we could go exactly where we wanted without Mum having to walk far. In this respect they made sure we had the exact same driver every day which was lovely. All in all a brilliant stay we will definitely be back.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mirembeLondon
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,John A wrote a review Mar 2017,50,Superb Personal Service,If you want the kind of personal attention that has not been easily accessible in the U.K. For over 50 years go and stay at The Sirayane Boutique & Spa where not only will your every request be immediately attended to but often anticipated. Pool attendants who know where you like to sit with how many cushions waiters who from day 2 recall your preferred breakfast juice or evening cocktail and a management team constantly presenting themselves in person to check all is well.  Add to that beautifully serviced rooms a pool one of two heated all year round a free shuttle bus into Marrakech several times a day and you have all the components that collectively make an enjoyable holiday whether young old or a family group.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,abigailzietsman wrote a review Mar 2017,50,This hotel took my breath away,"I booked a long weekend away for my husbands 40th Birthday I was a little nervous as he usually takes charge of all our travels but i didn't need to be.  I booked through Expedia as this was the only way i could get the best flight times not long after booking the flights and hotel the hotel contacted me.... impressive.    I mentioned we were coming for my husbands 40th and they made a note of this and then sent me a list of trips and other services provided by the hotel. I booked the transfer service from the airport and i would recommend this to anyone staying.... it was fuss freeeasy and very cheap to do... after speaking to many people who got a taxi the taxi's struggle to find the boutique and its only 20 minutes fro the airport why waste the time!?    The service upon arrival was amazing the staff could not do enough for you and we were given such a warm welcome.    Our room was number 105 which is a standard room and we loved it very cleansmartquiet and away from the pool which i liked. The view was lovely and when you have a shower the window opens and you can enjoy the view... the balcony also had a lovely little sofa area. The bed was made everyday and new towels given you had a robe and slippers in the room.    The hotel is very modern with a very calmrelaxed feel to it and the pool was lovely. You will be met by a lovely guy who will uncover a sunbed for you and place clean hotel pool towels down for you and fetch an umbrella if you require one. He was lovely very polite and always had the biggest smile- Sirayane hes a staff member to keep!    The bar staff love to chat to you and will come and take drink orders by the pool or at the seating area they make amazing cocktails and my husband loved the coffee! A good coffee is very important haha you always felt nothing was too much effort for them. If you meet Soufiane he is lovely and he looked after us well Sirayane again another staff member you need to keep hold of.    Breakfast is amazing and they serve everything!! including fresh juices.    We ate dinner at the hotel the night we arrived a tip would be to book the half board option before you arrive if you want to eat at the hotel the day you arrive as you have to give 24 hours notice. We didn't and ordered off their set menu which was still very lovely but cost a bit more than your half board option. The food is gorgeous and theirs plenty of it you won't be hungry.    The Spa WOW im going to struggle going back to a spa in the uk after this lovely experience. I booked a facial and it was one of the best facials i have had. We didn't book until we arrived and just keep in mind you can't really book a treatment on the day you need to do it the day before as they become very busy. The girls were lovely and again a big credit to the hotel.    The reception staff are very helpful and we were met by a very happysmiley gentleman who was lovely (I didn't get his name) but i think he was in charge along with a lady (who didn't smile as much).    The trips were expensive we didn't book any because we were there for such a short time ... You can find them cheaper with other tour guides but i don't know the quality they would be. Guests that we met who did the Atlas Mountains said it was excellent and a must see trip but you need your trainers as you do hike.    The Sirayane do take children even though we went in term time so we didn't see many.... But one question i would have for them is if we brought children what menus do you have for the evening food?    The owner appears everyday and greets all the guests and makes sure your enjoying your trip he served us champagne for my husbands bday.... you will defiantly get the personal touch staying here.    Its very obvious the owner looks after his staff and when we credited his staff and told him its obvious they all enjoy working there he said "" I treat my staff how i want them to treat my guests "" and that is very apparent- Well done Sirayane Boutique Hotel.",Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Berkshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abigailzietsman

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Leanne C wrote a review Mar 2017,40,Great relaxing hotel out of the hustle & bustle,We booked this hotel through Voyage Prive and we were very impressed. We had a mini suite which led directly out onto the pool which was great for going back and forth and meant we could use our own facilities. The room was modern clean and very attractive although the shower has no door so just beware if staying with a friend. They left us bottles of water every evening and shortbread biscuits which were delicious. We used the spa once for a massage which was lovely although wish we'd used it more during our stay. Breakfast was delicious and very fresh and there was lots of choice. You can also request omelettes and I'd recommend asking for the poached eggs.    The hotel offers a free shuttle bus to the main square but if you want to go anywhere else they will organise a private taxi. However it does work out quite expensive (charged in Euros) so I'd suggest using that to go out but get a local taxi coming home. We paid 150 for a taxi back from the Hivernage district.    We did the half day guided tour of the monuments that the hotel offers and I'd recommend doing that if you're not sure where to go or how to get around. They pick you up and drive you round all the places pay your entrance fees and take you back to the hotel. Our guide was very knowledgable and we learnt a lot.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeanneC936

The staff were very helpful and nothing was too much trouble. Just ask...and it's done. The food and service in the restaurant was good with a choice of traditional moroccan dishes or international cuisine. My wife is a pescatarian but there was plenty of choice for her. Be interesting to know if the menu is changed after 7 days as we had tried most dishes by the end of the week?    The bed was very comfortable and the bedroom dual aspect so sunrise in the morning one side - sunset in the evening on the other. Great bathroom too.    There were a couple of things that didn't quite work for us - the background music was sometimes either a bit loud or a bit random eg on lovely sunny morning at breakfast they were playing ""walking in a winter wonderland""! Which made us smile. The television didn't quite work sometimes but this wasn't that important.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Karen J wrote a review Feb 2017,50,Peaceful and relaxing,Peaceful location just outside of Marrakech with a free shuttle bus service into town at regular intervals.We had a beautiful room [Rm 130] that opened onto the pool and our own little garden space with our own loungers. We had booked in on a B&B basis so we could chose to eat in the hotel or venture into town. The breakfast was buffet style with plenty of choice and the staff were always very attentive and at the same time very discreet. We ate dinner in the hotel three times during our stay and were not disappointed; the food was delicious and beautifully presented. Their chicken and lemon tagine was the best I tasted on this trip. I indulged in two trips to the spa. The first on Saturday was a package of hammam salt scrub and a massage - i thought I knew how to exfoliate till I had this treatment! And the girl that did my massage was amazing - really attentive and maintained excellent pressure throughout the 60 minutes. My next treatment was a massage followed by a facial but unfortunately this didn't match up to the previous standard This was a different girl and I felt that she rushed the treatment and was just going through the motions. I was disappointed as I would expect to receive a consistent high level for these prices but there was such a huge difference in standard between the two treatments. This deterred me from booking any further treatments as I didn't know the names of the staff that had provided the excellent service. I'll have to pay more attention next time! It was my 50th birthday whilst I was there and the owner sent over champagne and a chocolate fondant cake to our room delivered by three singing waiters. That was such a nice thing to do. Having excellent free wi-fi throughout the hotel was an added bonus too. I recommend this hotel if you're looking for somewhere peaceful and indulgent but with the option to head into the chaotic city of Marrakech within 20 minutes if you fancy it.,Date of stay: February 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenjR7601HA

Rooms are a great size comfortable beds and layout of the room. Great decor throughout the hotel.    Staff are friendly and very accommodating to children.    Great little touches like shisha delivered to the room.    The owner is great he visits all the customers to introduce him self.    Now the negatives. Being in a secluded area outside the city centre we expected the food to be a lot better being our third visit to Marrakesh we have stayed in Riad's with exceptional breakfast  lunch and dinner which unfortunately was not present at this hotel.    Breakfast was ok with the usual continental cold and hot breakfast items.    Lunch and dinner was not good at all in total we ordered 8 different meals  costing around ¬£40 - ¬£60 pounds for a meal for two and a kids meal.    For the price and quality we expected a lot more.    And because the hotel is secluded it's not easy to just go out and eat outside.

The whole architecture is quite nice mauresque and cozy! rooms are specious.    What I liked the most is how the owner of the hotel was present ensuring that all is well The next day he called the manager who was standing in fromt of me insisting for him to go from one table to the other and ask if everybody had a good night. I liked the efforts to make sure customers' stays are wonderful.

We assumed the basic spa facilities would be free and we're looking forward to go straight to the spa as soon as we arrived. We were disappointed to discover that no services were Included and had to pay for hamam or any other facilities such as massages scrubs etc. We explained this to the staff who immediately called the owner of the hotel who listened to our concerns and expectations ( although we should have checked the spa menu before we left) and let us have one full treatment for free that amounted to 400 dirhams for the each of us. The guy was amazing and wanted to make sure we would not leave unhappy. The hamam and the body scrub were the most amazing we ever had! The woman scrubbed us and threw warm buckets of water over us and we truly felt we had been reborn after the amazing experience!!! Can't thank the owner enough! We paid for a massage the next day ( head and shoulder) equally amazing...    The room was lovely with a beautiful view of the mountains all basic facilities and excellent toiletries...the room was cleaned regularly and when we came back to the room after an outing all our clothes and things would have been re folded and beds made again...seems like they clean/inspect few times a day.    The bed was the most comfortable I've ever slept in we checked the mattress and noticed they had an excellent mattress protector that was doing the trick..we didn't feel like getting put of bed it was soooooo comfy!    They have a beautiful fireplace in the lounge where we sat every evening and the staff ensured it was nice and toasty for us and gave us ample peanuts and olives with our drinks to enjoy and reflect on our lives :)    The shuttle service was excellent but have to book both ways as not guaranteed as a small van and sometimes more passengers than space. The driver stops for literally 30 secs ok the way back and have to rush or you will the shuttle..he needs to slow down a bit!    Breakfast was ok nothing too special but nice and basic...orange juice and cucumber were fresh and amazing..    The heated pool was luke warm and we were not brave enough to jump in like the other guests we did ask to increase the temp a few times but not sure if they did.    The ambience in the hotel is peaceful romantic isolated scenic and ideal for adults without kids needing to get away from the hustle and bustle of life in general...exactly what we wanted..  Definitely not children friendly and I can understand why....a bit out of town but didn't bother us due the shuttle service.

Unfortunately it was cold and wet outside for much of time but that did not detract from our stay. The hotel is faultless and the staff are utterly fantastic. I cannot praise the staff enough really. The free shuttle bus was great we were taken to the medina and picked up bang on time and the driver was lovely. The breakfast provided a great choice and the dinner in restaurant was fab. We also had room service a few nights it was delicious but limited choice.    The only thing I would say was the restaurant was cold at night and also the maid did not refresh our tea tray with sweetener sachets despite me leaving her a note daily.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,jamiewalker2010 wrote a review Jan 2017,50,Excellent service and stunning hotel,Had a brilliant stay at the Siriyane and can only completely agree with all the excellent reviews this hotel has online. This was 1 of the main reasons I chose this hotel and it definitely didn't disappoint.    Both the welcome I received and friendly manner of all staff from reception to room service was some of the best service I have received anywhere. I stayed in room 101 which is large double with private terrace balcony that has view of pool and gardens and is part of main hotel. Lovely size room which also has small 2 seat couch with TV DVD and usual minibar.    After my initial worries about the distance to Medina it was great to find that the free shuttle bus the Siriyane run goes into and back from Medina about 6 times each way. When I was there this January 2017 it went into Medina at 09:30 11:00 12:3015:00 17:00 and 19:30. Return trips back to hotel were 10:30 13:00 15:45 18:30 22:00 and 23:15. These may be slightly out or missing some times but as you can see no real need for taxis.    The hotel grounds and pool area are beautiful with massive double bed size loungers and hammocks dotted around to relax in sun. The staff in all departments at Siriyane were so friendly and attentive it was lovely. The owner of the hotel also introduced himself to me on first day to check I was happy which was really nice. He then checked back with me a few more times throughout my 7 day trip to make sure I didn't need anything which again was a lovely touch.    I would recommend this hotel to anyone and it excels in every area so much that even if it had a poor area like bad breakfast for example I would still return as everything else was honestly so good. The breakfast is lovely by way with so much choice hot or cold you are spoilt for choice.

They were attentive  helpful and made our 5 day stay a joyful experience. We have stayed in many top hotels around the world and happily report the Sirayane as one of the best.    Location is outside the hustle and bustle of the old and new city but just a 15 minute journey away. The complimentary transfers to the Medina were really helpful. A stiff back was soon sorted out in the Spa.    Food in the restaurant was top notch varied menu - excellent Moroccan starters  main courses and one of the best fillet steaks I've had.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,LaithMar wrote a review Jan 2017,50,"Tranquil, beautiful hotel, Very helpful staff. Exactly what we wanted",After a very stressful year we decided to book a trip back to Marrakech to recharge. After looking around for a bit we decided to stay here. We stayed in 102 which overlooked the whole hotel. One of the best views if you like sitting out on your balcony with a drink in the evenings (which we do). Couldn't have asked for more from the staff ... very friendly very helpful. Mehdi (the owner) personally came to check we were ok numerous times.    There were free transfers to the Medina and back at regular intervals which helped a lot as we didn't want to eat in the hotel every evening and wanted to do a bit of exploring / shopping.    The Spa was great too. I had an oriental massage ... which was a bit too soft for me but the masseur was happy to make it near enough a sports massage for me. Perfect. The Mrs had a hammam (if that's what they're called?!) and she loved that.    We were there for New Years eve. The food and staff were amazing most of the entertainment was very good ... except for the main singer. We still had an amazing time anyway.    This is our second trip to Marrakech and we will definitely be coming back and staying at the Sirayane.

We had the double with terrace the bathroom was large (2 sinks) a nice big spacious room with a decently sized balcony. We absolutely loved staying at the pool during the day barely wanted to leave the premises. Both the pool guys and the waiters from the restaurant always gave us such excellent service that we'd return for the service even if the hotel room had been dirty or not up to our standards (which it totally wasn't).    The food at the restaurant was great and the breakfast buffet had an awesome variety. BUT after discovering the room service hamburger - that's all we ate.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,lewis10058 wrote a review Jan 2017,50,"It became ""OUR HOME""","My husband and I have just arrived home after spending an absolute fabulous week here at The Sirayane.  Both in our 50's we chose here to have a complete rest and being a small hotel the description suited us. We booked into the junior suite which was lovely nice bedroom lovely bathroom very private garden and own pool. On our second day the hotel owner came to talk to us as he did everyone. He later came to us and told us we could have a free upgrade to one of their executive suites. Words failed me..  We are very well travelled people and over the years have stayed in some superb accommodation but never ever have we stayed anywhere in such a beautiful place. Albeit still a bungalow on the grounds like the junior suite was but this suite blew us away. We had the most beautiful bedroom separate lounge fantastic walk in wet room extra large bath two televisions and on top of this the garden was just unbelievable. We had the biggest beautifully heated pool 5ft plus deep one end leading from patio doors we had a double bed outside plus sofa with chairs coffee table and gorgeous tended huge private garden.  We simply found it hard to leave the room. Breakfast was very good with a selection of various fresh fruits cheeses yogurts cereals different breads croissants homemade jams and honey there was also selection of hot dishes including fab scrambled eggs a toaster and mini grill plus you could have omelettes specially prepared for you. Lunchtime there was a snack menu which was very good and we had this delivered most days to our room which was fantastic to sit in our garden and just eat and chill. Night time there was a good choice of lovely homemade meals and sweets. You could tell as well the food was homemade as we are in this industry back in the uk and clearly they use all fresh produce. The fish was fantastic especially the salmon. They also do the most incredible homemade vegetable soup which we had 5 nights it was so so tasty served with Parmesan cheese.  We cannot fault this hotel in anyway shape or form. The staff were simply outstanding especially Zidane.  The hotel also has 2 pools one was fully heated and used every day especially with 2 families that had children. This is the first winter holiday where people have actually had a warm pool as normally they are freezing here certainly wasn't.  We also used the Spa...twice... it was so so good. We choose the one hour relaxing massage approx ¬£35 very cheap in comparison to some resorts but maybe one of the best we had. I also had my hair washed and blow dried something I rarely do in the uk lol but it was so nice.  Reception has a few free dvds for you to watch but in the local town we bought cheap copies approx ¬£2 thinking they wouldn't work but infact they were excellent if you see them there but we left them there after we had seen them.  The hotel offers free shuttle buses which we used but we did take taxis back sometimes if we wanted to come back before the allocated time. These cost 130 dirham. No for the downside...these taxis be carful as we found out twice we had no problem but one was an illegal taxi and after a frightening journey where the driver tried to take us via a field full of frightening men to which my husband made him turn around and then he was pulled by the police and we had to get out why the police sorted us out. My advice use the hotel shuttle as we weren't the only ones this happened to. If you do go into the famous square it's nothing short of crazy. Thousands of people descending Snake charmers which we saw many parents quickly pull their kids back as these snakes look plastic there not. Sadly monkies on chains and lucky lucky men selling anything & everything that hound you constantly. The soukes were very intimidating and many fake stalls selling fake spices etc. Then you have the problem of mopeds flying around you from every angle. I can't begin to tell you how nice it was to return to the wonderful peace and quiet of the hotel.  We went to the New Town this was a nice afternoon out and nearly normal lol.  Choosing this hotel was the best thing we did especially when we got back to the airport and met with many we had travelled with the week before and heard stories off many who had chosen hotels nearer to the centre. Stories of men climbing over high walls to break into rooms people who had been robbed and had awful food and many that had been ill even though they were 4 star hotels. It was truly scary listening to some stories and made us even more grateful.  The Sirayane was 15 mins out of town it was peaceful quiet superbly clean and had more than we ever expected but above all we always felt very very safe.  The owner told us he wanted it to be ""OUR HOME"" and it certainly became that we simply can't wait to go back but to enjoy time just staying there as we won't need to go out next time we don't need to it's just the most relaxing place we have ever stayed at and sadly we didn't want to leave. thank you to everyone here at The Sirayane for the most amazing friendly holiday xxxxx",Date of stay: January 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Derby, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lewis10058

I had a very relaxing massage  just what I needed !  The food was ok I would say that the menu was limited which is a shame but possibly room for improvement?  We booked a private tour around the atlas mountains with a company before leaving the UK and it was far cheaper than hotel prices. We had our own driver who was willing to stop at various places on the way.  Overall we had a very pleasant stay I would reccomend this hotel if you want to completely relax.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,LaurenMPK wrote a review Dec 2016,50,Relaxing weekend escape from London,My husband and I spent four nights at this hotel in early December. The moment we arrived we were welcomed by the owner and the rest of the friendly hotel staff. The service was incredible and because it was the off-season the hotel was quiet; when we arrived they upgraded us to a suite overlooking the swimming pool with a view of the Atlas Mountains in the distance. The room was spacious and comfortable and we took advantage of the services and amenities that this hotel has to offer.    On one rainy day we stayed at the hotel and used the spa services; both my husband and I got massages and they were fantastic. We also ate dinner at the hotel and it was absolutely delicious - I ordered the Marrakechi beef and my husband ordered a lamb tagine and we really enjoyed our meals.    We were pleased with the shuttle service that the hotel offers that drops off guests near the main square in town; the service is very reliable and convenient for going into town for dinner and exploring. You have to book the shuttle ahead of time but it runs every hour or two throughout the day.    We also booked the airport transfers through the hotel and it was convenient to do so. It was 20 euros total for 2 people which we were told is about the same amount as a taxi would have been from the airport to the hotel.    We also booked an excursion through the hotel - the day trip to the Atlas Mountains. It was our favourite day in Marrakech; our guide was excellent and we really enjoyed exploring the Berber villages.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,RonIngrid wrote a review Dec 2016,50,Simply Outstanding,It is an all-too-rare pleasure in this age of 'one-size-fits-all' to encounter a small boutique hotel that has all the advantages of being small yet can compete with the biggest and best in terms of luxury amenities and service.    The Sirayane is well removed from the noise and bustle of Djemma El-Fn√¢ but provides a free shuttle to take guests to and from the Medina in 15 minutes. After visiting the souks museums and palaces of Marrakech and experiencing the boundless energy of the Medina we found ourselves in need of relaxation - and that is something at which the Sirayane excels. We have indulged ourselves in massages in places as far afield as Scandinavia and Indonesia but the massages we had in the Sirayane Spa were second to none - we still feel relaxed several days after our return!    We used the small well-equipped gym every day and as we had booked one of the delightful suites with it's own walled garden and private heated swimming pool we were able to swim directly from our bedroom whenever we felt the desire - what a luxury (especially in November/December)!    The hotel provides an excellent comprehensive breakfast buffet and in the evening the restaurant offers both Moroccan and International menu with a choice sufficiently wide to ensure that we managed to eat something different every evening during our one-week stay.    Two other points I should mention because for me they can make or break a holiday - the quality of the bed (and thus the quality of my sleep during the stay) and the standard of service. On both points I award the Sirayane 5 stars! I have rarely slept as well in a hotel - and never better. And from the proprietor down to the humblest employee we sensed a genuine desire to do the maximum to please and to make our stay a memorable experience.    All this doesn't come cheap of course but there can be no doubting the value for money.

We also were impresses that every evening around 8pm there would be a knock at the door by a lady dropping off bottles of water.

We called reception and they sent out a maintenance guy he couldn‚Äôt sort this upon arrival so he said he would come back. In this time we had gone for dinner.

Food was great defiantly 10/10.  Breakfast was a buffet and was such a wide selection to choose from.  Lunch was pretty standard ‚Äì range from sandwiches burgers and pasta dishes.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Fabinhobp wrote a review Nov 2016,20,Not a 5'star hotel,Let me start by saying I hate to write negative reviews but I feel compelled to do it for the sake of future travelers.  Sirayane is not even close to a 5 star hotel and staying there almost ruined our first time in Marrakech.  The hotel is located far from the city center (almost 30 minutes by car) in a very remote area and altough they offer a shuttle their schdule is not a good one. They have a return to the hotel at 6:30 and the next one only at 10:00 PM. It seems they want you back at the hotel early to dine at the hotel. I could skip the shuttle and take a taxi but getting a taxi at night to go to a remote area is something I am not comfortable doing so I either had to return too early 6:30 PM or wait until 10:00 PM.  We stayed at one of the Mini-Suites for about 200 Euros/night which is actually a lot of money in Morocco and the room is far worse from the amazing pictures on their website. The Mini-suite is average with cheap furniture and everyday the shower run out of hot water within e few minutes.  The breakfast buffet is very poor and definitely the worst of all 5 star hotels we have ever been.  Because we returned before dinner every night we use the hotel restaurant and room service which is only average but expensive for Morocco.  The internet was very slow and kept disconnecting.  We would not recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to have a good time in Marrakech there are too many better options for an even lower price.  The only positive note are the people who were nice and kind.  We hope to come back to Marrakech again but will stay as far as possible to the Sirayane Hotel.,Date of stay: November 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Fort Lauderdale, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fabinhobp
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Shortymutant wrote a review Nov 2016,50,A Quiet Place,This is a peaceful and relaxing boutique hotel. There are less than 30 suites which we believe helped fuel the gentler pace seclusion and feeling of space. After a day of wandering around the city we found ourselves looking forward to returning to the hotel...a feeling that didn't diminish for the length of our seven night stay. The hotel lays on a regular shuttle to/from Jemaa el Fna and the value of this cannot be underrated (have a few haggles with the local taxi drivers and you'll get the point). In particular 'thank you' to Mohammed (Zidane) in the restaurant and Rashid (driver..took us to Essaouira) - both were excellent and went out of their way to make us feel welcome. All in all a very good holiday.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,jondodd63 wrote a review Nov 2016,50,Wonderful relaxing break,We stayed for 5 nights and everything was perfect. Our flight was delayed by two and a half hours but the hotel bus was waiting for us and we were at the hotel and checked in within 20 minutes. Very smooth.    We were taken to a fantastic room that was probably the quietest I've stayed in. The bed was enormous and very comfortable and the attention to detail was lovely.    Breakfast was good with a wide choice and it was nice to sit on the terrace and wake up slowly. The staff are great as they somehow seemed to know when to come and see you and when to leave you alone. We also met the owner on a couple of occasions and it it was immediately obvious that he has a real passion for his business and really understood what guests want and how to deliver. Outstanding.    We had lunch by the pool most days and the chef really knows what he's doing. We also really enjoyed a couple of evening meals and overall the food was great every time.    We spent weeks choosing our hotel for this break and I can honestly say that we absolutely made the right choice.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,myopinionbk wrote a review Oct 2016,50,Pure Tranquillity,First time in Marrakech spent 4 days here and it is superb if you want to just rejuvenate and relax. Staff are very friendly and attentive.    The complex is small uncrowned with the grounds and bedroom very clean the maid comes to make up the rooms twice a day which is a nice touch.    Breakfast in plentiful  I would recommend evening dinner at the Medina where the hotel runs free shuttle buses throughout the day/night the local Moroccan Soup (50p) and Chicken Tagine (¬£3.50). In comparison we were charged ¬£9 for a Moroccan Soup at the hotel :S  Note that the Medina comes to life during the evening/night with various entertainment acts.    We traveled as a couple and as parents of an 11 and 13 year old feel this is not a place for older children.    Overall amazing place if you want to unwind and relax and have good weather.    Tip - Exchange money at the exchange as you walk out of the airport - so after you have collected your baggage gone through all security and as if you were leaving the airport. The rates are better than in the airport and you also do not need to queue.

The service was frist class and a real credit to the hotel. The room was perfect bed was really comfy with a great mattress and pillows. The pool was great with perfect sun loungers. The large pool was ""Cold"" and the small pool was warm. The guest were really quiet and respectfull of their surroundings.Breakfast was great with all of the usual bits and bobs. The mint tea was stunning!    Great bits    Book the airport pick ups for ¬£18 each way.  The free shuttle bus into central Marrakech was great.  Breakfast.  Pool lounger  Quiet and relaxed ad secluded.  Not really for kids or children.    Not so great Bits    The dinner and lunch menus are limited We stayed for 8 nights and really struggled to stay and eat at the hotel.  Prices are on par with the UK in terms eating both in the hotel and central Marrakech.  A bottle of beer is ¬£5.50 at the hotel and ¬£5 in central Marrakech.  WIFI is ropey and slow at times.  Nothing within walking distance and no small shop onsite. Stock up on snacks.    Central Marrakech - Hmmm!!!    You have to try it once i suppose.    Its is really a den of iniquity - constant harrassment rude peopleimpossible to navigate and avaerage food. We ate at Zwin Zwin cafe which was good. beats burgers which was good and cafe Zif Zif which was average. Very difficult to get a beer with few establishments allowed to sell alcoho - we went to cafe arabe a few timesl. Would recommend walking to Guilez which was much better. Its the modern section of marrakech and more tolerable.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,hellu38 wrote a review Oct 2016,50,very nice hotel,The hotel is about 20 minutes from the airport and from Marrakech its a beautiful hotel we stayed in the mini suite and it was lovely the room was a very good size and the bathroom had one of those monsoon showers no bath though. One thing that i was missing was a hair conditioner as i was expecting the hotel to provide that. In the evenings the gave you 2 small bottles of waters which was very nice for some reason one of the evening we din`t get them but it wasn't a problem for us as we went and bought some from the bar. They also left us some moroccon biscuits every day which was nice touch to have with a cop of tea in the afternoons. The breakfast was okay  nothing special but something for everyone. One thing i did notice that we normally had breakfast about 10ish and the breakfast finishes at 10.30 that lots of food was finished and not topped up so we missed out on things just because we were late risers. The pool area was lovely the pool water was nice and refreshing and the sun beds were very comfortable the pool boy was super helpful and really good at his job. One thing i would recommend is to have a drink service around the pool area in every few hours. i did see the waiter come around few times throughout our 5 day stay but we never got his attention to serve us so we had to go to the bar ourselves if we wanted to get some drinks which was not a issue but it would add to the nice experience. We had quite a few spa treatments - the hammam with sea salts was amazing it was nice that you could have it as a couple together and then have massages straight after. the massages were very good i have massages on regular bases and i must say they were one of the best ones i`ve had for a long time. All in all i really enjoyed our stay and would definitely go back .,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hellu38

The hotel it's self of remote and perfect for a relaxing few days it does have a great shuttle to the square everyday should you wish to visit the medina.  Room - first impressions good double sink etc on closer inspection the patio door was damaged and the glass seal was broke allowing wind and so a whistle through it. The shower was nice but we like a power shower and this wasn't. These are only small problems as a while it was good.  Pool - the pool is great and there is enough beds for everyone so no fighting. Towles were brought to you as you wanted them by the attentive pool staff.  Food - breakfast was decent and varied and fresh and feeding the little birds while having the breakfast was nice.  We had 2 lunches there and both were very nice I would recommend the burger or was fabulous.  We also had one evening meal there it was English prices so more expensive than the medina but the food was sublime just a Pitty it didn't have our first choice meal.  the staff are very considerate and always at your beckon call which is a nice touch.,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Warrington, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Buffalotwigg

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,JNW51 wrote a review Oct 2016,50,Wonderful relaxing stay,We recently stayed here for 4 nights. Having previously stayed in the centre of Marrakech we thought it would be more restful to try a hotel which is removed from the hustle and bustle of this wonderful city.  The Sirayane is excellently run by the owner the managers and the staff. The building and the grounds are very modern and an attraction is themselves. Our room was in the main building with a balcony which looked south and was just the most perfect place to relax with a cup of mint tea. The room itself was beautifully presented - spotlessly clean and with every facility.  The restaurant is excellent and the staff attentive and friendly. There is a great choice of food for breakfast. The free shuttle is efficient and takes about 15 minutes to get into the centre.  I can't imagine a better place to stay in the area.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,b_m_g10 wrote a review Sep 2016,50,Fabulous relaxed hotel,We spent a lovely 4 nights relaxing at the Sirayane - we couldn't fault the service throughout our stay it was impeccable from start to finish. Our room was room 103 fantastic view overlooking the pool and generally lovely all round. If I were to be picky - this may be an odd observation but the toilet is weirdly very high off the ground (not great for short people!) the air con light was reallllly bright  we had to cover this as we like a dark room and the bed and pillows could have perhaps been better but it wasn't that they were uncomfortable just not necessarily to our taste. Pool area is great lovely big comfy sun beds and umbrellas available. Generally the area is quiet and relaxing but perhaps lacks background music of some sort? The breakfast was great every morning lots of variety we ate in the restaurant one evening and enjoyed the food although perhaps a little pricey. In general there were things that bothered us a little - water and cans of drink for example were pricey there is also no shop near by and nowhere in the hotel to buy snacks (perhaps the option to buy snacks from the bar like crisps etc could be introduced?). Shuttle service to the medina was excellent - was glad at the end of the day to be going back to our out of town retreat and not staying the in madness! We had a complimentary spa treatment as part of our booking and enjoyed a shoulder/head massage - the spa area was lovely. The shower in the spa can also be used if you have an evening flight and can't extend check out on your room (which we couldn't as the hotel was fully booked but this worked just as well). All in all this hotel lived up to the fab reviews and the above are really only minor observations.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Kal86 wrote a review Sep 2016,40,Perfect retreat,My wife and I stayed at the hotel for our minimoon. With approx 15 rooms the hotel is perfect if you're after a quiet retreat as The guests mainly consists of couples or friends (over 25).    However we found the hotel a perfect balance as it is approx 15 min car journey into central Marrakesh allowing us to experience the hustle and bustle of the city but also able to come back and chill out.    As it was our minimoon we were upgraded to the honeymoon package which includes a hamam a 30 min massage turndown every night free bottle of wine and bottles of water each night.    We were extremely impressed with the free shuttles that the hotels offers multiple times throughout the day which we would recommend to avoid being ripped off by the local taxi drivers (the shuttle is also more comfortable)    The food has also been great! The John Dory fish is a dish we would definitely recommend.    The staff were extremely attentive and always on hand to help for example calling restaurants for us to make reservations.    The hamam experience which the hotel offers is one which we would also recommend you walk out feeling relaxed and very clean.    One point to note and not a negative  though we've had a fantastic experience if you're after pure luxury there may be other hotels in Marrakesh that offer this service.    In conclusion we would definitely recommend Sirayane Boutique.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Joe S wrote a review Sep 2016,50,Incredible!,Words can't describe how perfect this hotel is and how much we enjoyed our recent stay. Having just returned from Marrakech after 7 days exploring this magnificient city and relaxing in the beautiful grounds of the Sirayane we already can't wait to return.    Moroccan tea and biscuits were served to us on our arrival our bags were swiftly taken to our room by the Porter and after a brief tour of the hotel we were shown to our room. The room had a beautiful view of the pool and the Atlas Mountains rose petals scattered all around which was a very nice touch. Very romantic.    The level of customer service was fantastic. Nothing was too much trouble the staff were very attentive and were very happy to book restaurants for us in the evening and day trips during our stay - they really went above and beyond. When we walked out to a bed by the pool there would always be a member of staff coming over to lay down towels and when too hot would put up an umbrella to shade us.    The hotel was always immaculate our room was cleaned and tidied everyday and when we returned from our night in the medina - our room had always been turned down and bed covered in rose petals.    The shuttle service into the Medina was fantastic the driver was great - one night he dropped off other guests in the Medina and then took us a little bit further to another drop off point which was closer to our restaurant. He then called the Riad when we were close by and someone came and met us. A great touch!    The hotel food and drink were also faultless. The breakfast buffet was big and varied everything we ate was delicious.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,dvbStaffordshire wrote a review Sep 2016,50,Just lovely!,The three of us (2 adults and our 12 year-old son) spent glorious 4 days at Sirayane courtesy of a BA city break deal and we enjoyed every minute of it. Marrakesh airport is only 10 minutes away and the hotel is happy to arrange your collection from the airport if you email them beforehand. The transfer costs ‚Ç¨20 which is more or less what a taxi would cost.    The airport itself is a little chaotic as you approach the immigration desks although the officers themselves are very helpful (nb ‚Äúshokraan‚Äù means thanks in Arabic which is a very handy phrase to learn. We will come to ‚Äúno thanks‚Äù shortly). Once through customs and so on the airport is modern and clean with lots of cashpoints to get the local currency of Dirhams from rather than waiting to get into the city for them.    The hotel is architecturally absolutely stunning as are the gardens. A personal greeting from the owner Msr Smires was also very welcome as was the mint tea and Fanta. We were given a short guided tour of the facilities before being taken to our room 101 which overlooked the pool and the countryside. It was nice to have our bags taken up for us too!    The room was cool and spacious with a splendid bathroom and was kept spotlessly clean and slippers and bathrobes were also provided together with a safe and mini-bar. The air conditioning struggles a little at the end of a long hot day but the outside temperature was over 42C so hardly surprising. Small complementary bottles of water are provided by the turndown team each evening.    The pool is one of the best I have ever used at a hotel and it‚Äôs wonderfully quiet too with very comfortable mattresses and towels provided. There are lots of birds around (sparrows will hop onto your table looking for crumbs!) and the morning chorus is lovely to wake up to. The staff are unfailingly delightful    The breakfasts are more than enough with lots of variety fresh bread and juices and on a hot day that‚Äôs all we needed until the evening. The hotel organises free minibus trips to Jamaa el-Fnaa which you book onto when you need them; the earliest in is 0900 and the last back is 2315; obviously you could always get a taxi if the times didn‚Äôt suit but they worked fine for us and the drivers are very obliging (you will note that the minibus is security-checked at the gate on the way in; this is a government requirement apparently).    The hotel organises a number of tours and trips out the only one we took advantage of was the guided tour. It was well worth it to have a local help you explore the Medina and the souks. Cam and driver Jamal (apologies if I have spelled either wrongly) also took us to see the Medersa and the Majorelle Gardens and explained the history of the city. The medina in particular can be quite intimidating until you get a little used to it and we were shown things we would have never found without him. The tour seemed expensive at the time (150 Dh for 3 of us including a child) but some of the tours we saw had 20 or more people trailing the guide-you get what you pay for!    Other things we enjoyed; we took a horse-drawn carriage from Jamaa el-Fnaa (fun but choose your horses carefully some of them are very skinny and a couple of them collapsed while we were there) we saw the Saadi Tombs (well worth it) and the Menara Gardens (no water in the pool at the moment but nice all the same) and wandered around a lot! Have a glass of juice from one of the stalls and try eating at one of the pop-ups (the sales patter from the waiters is really very good) and try to relax and enjoy! I have had hassle in a few cities in Morocco but none of us had the slightest problem in Marrakech-a polite ‚Äúnon merci‚Äù or ‚Äúla shokraan‚Äù works very well. The locals are charming friendly and welcoming and if you want to revise for your trip watch ‚ÄúHideous Kinky‚Äù which was filmed in and around Marrakech (it‚Äôs a lot less squalid than it‚Äôs portrayed as of course).    On the way home Msr Smires saw us off as charmingly as ever. The airport is fine but watch the cost of snacks and water in the departure lounge. Euros only and you can easily spend ‚Ç¨20 on a couple of bottles of water and some nuts.    So to sum up-a wonderful hotel and staff and a fabulous city. We would go back tomorrow!,Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dvbStaffordshire

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,H S wrote a review Aug 2016,50,The perfect break,Staying at the Sirayane Hotel was definitely one of the best decisions made in planning our trip to Morocco.  The service of the staff was impeccable; the manager made the effort to know each of his guests personally and one member of staff in particular Soufiane was unfailingly helpful and went out of his way to fulfill any requests we had. The pool employees were attentive and moved the umbrella to provide shade when wanted and overall all staff were very accommodating.  We stayed in rooms 115 and 116 which both had lovely views of the pool a garden a minibar and television. The housekeeping was of a high quality and the rooms remained clean and comfortable throughout our visit; DVD's were available on request at the front desk and a collection of books in different languages (including English French and German) were provided for personal use too. The spa was exquisite and the facial treatment was a big success with us. Also the staff working there were charming and hospitable.  The location of the hotel is perfect as it is a 20 minute free shuttle-bus journey away from the busy town square of Medina which had a lively atmosphere and many restaurants to pick from with vegetarian options in most of them too but it was nice to go back to peace of the hotel at the end of the night. The hotel food was also very tasty with the chef being renown for his cooking but the atmosphere more tranquil than what you would get at the square.  Once again I must stress the brilliance of the staff and hotel for being so considerate; I feel that there being only 28 rooms meant the service received was inevitably outstanding. Furthermore the excursions we went on through the hotel were also wonderful and eye-opening. I feel certain that when we visit again we will stay at this beautiful hotel and I highly recommend it!,Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hs476

The whole of the grounds were very safe and our apartment was not that far at all from the swimming pool and restaurant. It was easy to put our little one to sleep with a monitor and still be near the pool as it was not that far yet quiet enough wen we were inside.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Shaz11 wrote a review Aug 2016,50,Perfect getaway,I went with my three friends to Marrakech. We booked for a few nights. Initially we planned to do excursions but ended up staying at the hotel mostly and going out in the evenings. The hotel was clean spacious and calm. I loved the huge doors to enter the reception area making it feel special. Then through the outdoor water feature to the hotel. We arrived early and had some cold drinks to cool ourselves down in the bar area. We waited for our room to be ready and then once it was we unpacked and went to the pool. The bar staff were attentive around the pool. We used the shuttle service to the square. I would recommend lunch there as the food is amazing and it's a shame we didn't have dinner there. Anything we needed the staff were able to resolve it. I would definitely recommend this hotel for a relaxing break away with friends or family.,Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shaz11

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,artistaa wrote a review Jul 2016,50,Incredible Visit,Service at this hotel is top notch. The rooms are beautiful. It's obvious the hotel was carefully planned because of its aestheticism. The minimalist style has Moroccan touches. The breakfast had many options and was delicious. There are only 28 rooms so it doesn't feel crowded. There is a free shuttle to drop you off and pick you up from the medina (15-20 minute ride). The latest pickup is at 11:15 pm. I much prefer being outside the medina for the air conditioning ample space safety and the quiet. I arranged an airport pickup (20 euro one way) and it was there when we left the airport. The hotel also offers a selection of day tours. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. It made our Marrakesh experience even better.,Date of stay: July 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Markham, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/artistaa

We arrived in the evening. We were late because our plane was delayed (easy jet) but staff offered food after hours which was nice  There were children there not sure if its a family hotel though seems a bit too quiet for children (no offence)  Rooms were nice we were in the prestige room with a garden.  It is very secluded around 20 mins from the city but they do provide a free shuttle service (not as frequent as i would like but it still saved us money for taxi until around 11pm)  Breakfast was ok was the same every day.  Staff are very friendly.... cleaners were ok but occassionally didnt take note of the 'do not disturb' tag  Spa was fantastic would reccommend the back massage (best massage ive had in my life)  If you want a quiet hotel out of the city this is the best place.,Date of stay: July 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/72dominiqued

The food is good we were B&B but we sampled lunch and dinner and it was all great. The cocktails are lovely too!! Staff very attentive and all service excellent including service from pool/towel guy he was fab.    The only thing for us was not having the flexibility to walk out of the hotel it's very remote but the complimentary hotel shuttle is great so you are not stranded. We have stayed much closer to the square before so everything was walking distance and we missed that this time around.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Mark G wrote a review Jul 2016,50,Random getaway week break,What can I say ? This was a random booking looking for a flight within 4 hours due to previous planned holiday to Mauritius put off due to unforeseen circumstances. First time in Marrakech but on the wife's wish list of destinations to visit for the culture etc. we are still here but 2 days left and to be quite honest (if you read me other reviews it's takes a lot for me to give something a top review) this place is absolutely amazing. It is an oasis of peace away from the centre but the hotel lays on a regular FREE return shuttle service to town. Liama at reception will do anything to make your stay enjoyable ALL the staff bar pool restaurant will bend over backwards to please you without being pushy or in your face they have the service spot on. The spa & treatments we both had different days (massages) we have done spa & massages Kent Liverpool London and Malaysia but the hotel masseurs are outstanding they raise the bar without a doubt. If I had a negative about anything it would only be the lunchtime menu it really needs to be maybe looked at and things added as it is to basic and small if am honest but the management can easy dirt that. Rooms are spotless and cleaned daily we settled gigot mini suite and happy we did big open planned separate toilet & wet room shower private garden facing posted. We been to Marrakech centre every day with ease and happy we got this instead of inside city. If your planning Marrakech this is place to stay.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Fiona G wrote a review Jul 2016,50,Amazing,My partner and I are currently staying here and nearing the end of our holiday. We booked a four day trip to relax and recharge from our busy life back home.    Words cannot describe how lovely this hotel is. The staff are excellent the facilities are really good and the food is tasty with the option to have traditionally Moroccan or international food (the Moroccan Pancakes are definitely something I would recommend).    What really makes this hotel though is the free shuttle bus that takes you straight into the city centre - saving you a lot of money in cab fare. In addition the hotel offers lots of excursions too; ranging from camel rides to a guided tour of the Souks.    The fact that the hotel is outside of the city centre is also really nice as it gives you the chance to relax in the peace and quiet after a busy day in the city.    Would absolutely stay here again.,Date of stay: July 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Colchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/884fionag

Lovely spacious rooms with everything you need. Staff were very friendly and helpful and especially the pool staff who always saved our sun lounger for us by the pool every morning!

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Mark wrote a review Jul 2016,50,Close to being perfect,I don't normally review hotels until a few days after I return for various reasons but whilst on our last day sitting in the sun I thought I would type something up.    Firstly the hotel is located only a short 10 minute drive from the airport. On arrival we had a local mint tea and some biscuits which was nice. We were swiftly shown to our room room number 120 which was very spacious and was decorated with some rose petals and a bottle of wine I had requested before arriving.    We thought the bed was very comfortable mini bar was stocked well shower was very good with plenty of towels and dressing gowns. Our room had a private garden and some chairs which was nice to spend time in the evening.    The food was beautiful with a nice mix of local and international dishes in the evening. We went half board so this was included but I would imagine it does add up if you went bed and breakfast only. Breakfast was plentiful and the juices were very refreshing. Your table was reserved each evening which was a nice touch.    Personally I like the idea of the hotel not being all inclusive I felt this stop people having too many drinks and getting loud round the pool. This is definitely a quiet and chilled out hotel. The drinks menu should cater for everyone's tastes and the cocktails were delicious.    I do think the hotel should not allowed children to stay. Many past reviews have mentioned how peaceful it is but we stayed on a week where there were some children and that peace was somewhat missing on days which was a shame. There is nothing for children to do here except the pool so it does also seem unfair to bring them here.    The staff certainly make a big difference and will go out there way to please. Special mention to the pool boy he will reserve your beds every morning which saves having to get up at the crack of dawn. The pool never felt overly busy with plenty of beds to go around. He will take care of keeping you in the shade even if your toes start to appear in the sun!    Wifi is brilliant no annoying passwords to keep typing in either!    A few improvements I feel could be made a big bottle of water in the evening turndown service would be more appreciated than the small bottles especially when the outside temperatures is in excess of 40c! An upgrade in TV channels in the room? I could only find one British channel BBC news.    Everything has a 10% service charge to be included which actually works well as you don't need to worry about tipping and the more you buy they more they receive. What I haven't had a chance to ask the manager is whether this gets distributed to all staff including the the maids and gardeners?    I would not hesitate to return if the small improvements above did get implemented I can quite easily see this hotel becoming top 5 in Marrakech to stay!    . .,Date of stay: July 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Reading, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markd825
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,CautiouslyOptimistic wrote a review Jul 2016,50,Second stay and still spectacular,We were looking for a relatively cheap and easy break for some guaranteed sunshine and a culture shock. Having stayed at the Sirayane last July this wonderful little hotel popped into mind and we decided to book a week here; this time bringing some more family with us.    I'm always nervous when I bring family or friends to somewhere I've stayed before and this time was no exception; I was promising calm quiet grounds with excellent service and plenty of things to do nearby. To my delight the Sirayane has remained exactly as I remembered. A beautiful quiet hotel with only a few rooms pretty gardens and staff who do everything possible to ensure you enjoy your stay. Special mentions are required for Soufiane and Zidane on the waiting team as well as Rachid one of the drivers and Aimad and Miloud at the pool.    The Food & Beverage manager continues to strive to meet every guest and provide good quality food and drinks and overall he succeeds. Breakfast is still simple but plentiful the lunch menu offers a good range of options at 80-210 MAD and the dinner menus are excellent although a little pricey for some dishes. Drinks are average prices with beers at 50 MAD and cocktails at 85 MAD. Being vegetarian often makes my menu options limited but the staff here are happy to change dishes to suit. Room service is pretty much anything on offer on any menu don't feel you're limited to one menu!    The hotel has tennis courts which we managed to use this time round an excellent spa a good gym and two pools one of which is heated. If you need to hideaway inside or simply want a night in front a film the rooms have DVD players and there's a small selection of DVDs at reception. There's a good pool table in the sports bar along with several TVs (usually playing sport but if you're the only ones there the staff will happily switch some music on instead we opted for some VH1 Power Ballads). Aside from those options there isn't huge amounts to do here apart from relax and the hotel caters for that perfectly. Comfortable mattress sunbeds with pillows and excellent pool staff running around adjusting your parasol and giving you extra pillows and towels.    The hotel also runs a fairly regular free shuttle service to the Medina a 10-15 minute drive away as well as several excursions. If you want to come back later than 11pm or the shuttle times don't suit a Grand Taxi will cost you approximately 100 MAD.    Excursions include trips to the Atlas Mountains waterfalls Ourika Valley and the coastal town of Essouria. On my first trip we did the Ourika valley trip which includes a typical stop at an Argan Oil Cooperative a Berber home and then on to the main event which is a trek up to the beautiful falls. This time we opted for Essouria and I would highly recommend it (or staying a few nights there). It's a long drive (3 hours) but you stop en route at an Argan Oil Cooperative briefly along with a more entertaining stop at a tree with goats in it. The town is spectacular far more calm than Marrakech with beautiful blue and white buildings and a refreshing coastal breeze. Typically if the weather is cloudy in Marrakech it's bright in Essouria so keep an eye on the forecast if you want to do this trip. We started at 8am spent about 4 hours in the town and then came back. You can spend a little longer just let your driver know. The price is fixed for up to 6 people so if it's just two of you and you want to keep the cost down make friends with someone else at the hotel.    We stayed in a Mini Suite with Garden again on our first visit we were upgraded for free but enjoyed it so much that we booked this accommodation type again. It's lovely having your own little garden with sunbeds that are a few metres from the pool.    The rooms have had a little makeover since my last visit with new soft furnishings new tiling in the bathroom and a coat of paint. They certainly weren't in desperate need of it a year ago so this is a testament to how proud the owner is of his hotel. He made sure to pop over and say hello during our stay and was very keen to make sure we were enjoying our time here. Free water on turndown is a nice added extra.    Glad to see that some of my previous suggestions for improvements were implemented. Glass tables are spotless outside seating is dusted daily and excursion leaflets are available. The wifi has also improved a lot.    Other improvements/suggestions:    - Still missing a full length mirror in rooms    - Beds around the pool will need a tidy up soon    - Selling ice creams/lollies at the bar would be a treat (adults love just as much as kids)    - Adding a covered area on the gardens or using an existing space for a table tennis table would be good    - Chess/backgammon sets available to use is an easy addition and adds activities to pass the time if you want to hide from the sun    - Pool needs a bit of a clean at the moment (minor bits of dirt on the grouting)    I'm really struggling to find faults/suggestions which should give you some confidence if you're looking to book a stay here.    Overall this place is an amazing small hotel. Despite the continuous praise it receives it hasn't hugely increased prices so if that doesn't change I'll continue to come back and recommend to all. The Sirayane just needs to keep doing what it's doing and hold on to the amazing dedicated staff it employs.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CautiouslyOptimistic

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Darren P1968 wrote a review Jun 2016,40,2nd visit and good,We stayed 2 years ago and don't ever go back but we wanted to go back and enjoy the stay.    We had 4 nights and overall not as good as last time but still very enjoyable.    It was busier and almost full and there were some very loud characters in. Not the hotels fault but the peace and quiet was lost for 2 of the days.    The rooms we're showing signs of age a little and whilst the bed was very large it wasn't comfy for either of us. They are also very light as the shower doesn't have a door on so it's very light on a night (night lights on) and in the morning.    The staff who were nearly all the same as last time and the owner were brilliant as last time a real credit to themselves and the hotel. Extremely helpful and very good.    The menu was exactly the same as 2 years ago which surprised us. We ate twice and the food was very enjoyable both times.    Drinks and the food were very expensive to me and an extra 10% added on top which I commented about on my last review.    The gardens are lovely and we really enjoyed the hammam and scrub.    The pools were refreshing but a little dirty. The sun beds were very nice too but again needed a clean around as we found broken glass and cigarette ends around the place.    Again all the staff were brilliant and it's a great place to stay. The wifi was slow but that's true across Marrakech.    There is a shuttle bus which is very useful into town and it's great to be outside of the madness of town too.    Water in the room and biscuits each day were a nice touch as was the patterns left in the towels and bedding.    A very good 4 but not a 5 for reasons stated. There is also more security than we experienced last time which is reassuring if that's needed.

The staff were super friendly and helpful the rooms spacious clean and welcoming the food delicious and the location fantastic.    I want to give two examples of the amazing treatment we received. Firstly a friend wanted non alcoholic beer - they didn't have any. But the next day at lunch some appeared - they'd actually gone out and purchased some especially! Secondly I had joked it would be nice to be constantly in some shade when round the pool - the Manager aske the pool attendant to constantly move our umbrella to ensure we we in shade whilst at the pool. Although a comment said in jest they took it to heart and made it so.    It really was as if our wish was their command. This place is an oasis. I would highly recommend the hotel as a get away for friends couples or those with young children.    Added bonus a shuttle to/from town (which was 15 minutes away).

The manager comes and introduces himself when you arrive and welcomes you personally which is a nice touch. Rooms are immaculate and very comfortable.  This hotel offers pure relaxation.

Fabulous spa on site and 2 pools with foam beds towels and frequently relocated parasols. Drinks by the pool.  Quiet relaxing and luxury.  Only bit i had difficulty with was that the beds were really hard and gave me back ache !  Note...no tipping on site as 10%added on the final bill.  ...the one day tour of the city from hotel was mostly good but be warned of very expensive herbalist shop visit and a un requested visit to see some palm trees which turned out to be a try to sell us camel rides .would rather have been to photograph museum maybe...so be prepared to request all the places u do /do not want to see.  Marrakesh is all about getting money off you. Im usually a very trusting person but without fail everyone in the city wanted money. Trust no one ! ....but enjoy and laugh at the antics.

The hotel restaurant offered a wide choice of dishes on two separate menus - European and traditional Moroccan    Free transfers were offered to and from the airport and the hotel also arranged transport to nearby restaurants. Special mention must go to the staff who were attentive and friendly throughout our stay.,Date of stay: May 2016,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/28timb
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,davidpratt2016 wrote a review Jun 2016,50,Great Stay for a Young Couple,I booked this stay as a surprise birthday present for my girlfriend. I wanted something in between a city break (like Barcelona) and a relaxing holiday (such as a Mediterranean island).    Marrakech and the Sirayane hotel was the perfect mix of both.    The hotel itself is excellent. We stayed for five nights and could have easily spent all of the time at the hotel. The relaxing pool the brilliant service from staff providing drinks and lunch the spacious well furnished rooms; all lead to a feeling of being totally pampered -- which we were. The pool the spa the lounge bar and the meals were all top class.    The staff were the perfect mix of friendly helpful assistive but not too overbearing. The free shuttle service to the medina was very useful and flexible and the reception were very helpful when we wanted to organise a trip quad biking in the desert.    Prices in the hotel for drinks and meals are good too similar to what you would be paying in the UK.    Overall a fantastic stay and would love to come back some time,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidpratt2016

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Mrslaurawood wrote a review Jun 2016,50,"Outstanding service, beautiful accommodation and great food",We came for a short stay (without our children) to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary and it was nothing short of excellent!  The hotel is beautiful and small enough to feel exclusive and not over crowded. We stayed in a standard room and it was large clean and spacious with everything we could need. We even found rose petals on the bed! Leaving biscuits and water in the room each day was a nice touch and the toiletries smelt amazing!  The pool is a great size and the loungers are super comfy with the attentive attendant appearing whenever the sun moved just to make sure we had shade if we wanted it. Lovely!  The cocktails were delicious (loved the basil and cucumber martini!) and the breakfast and evening meals were delicious with the waiters taking care of our every need. The local red wine was surprisingly good (the French influence?) and we enjoyed the shisha in the sports bar too.  The spa was lovely and we had a hammam together which was certainly an experience! You have to book a day or two in advance so on a short stay make sure you book ASAP.  We headed into town once and it's beyond hectic and a bit intimidating but worth experiencing. However we spent most of the time relaxing at the hotel as it felt like a haven of calm!  Overall we had a fantastic stay and we will definitely be back! If you are looking for a small hotel outside of the town then it's perfect. We would highly recommend it!

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,EmilySHPearce wrote a review Jun 2016,50,Absolutely beautiful - loved this hotel.,My boyfriend took me here for a 5 night surprise holiday for my 25th birthday - wow he impressed!    We had a huge balcony room (prestige room) with a double shower double basin rose petals all over the bed and bathroom as well as 3 wardrobes! It was so spacious and luxurious - we saw a friends room in the gardens but think we fared better despite this not being as pricey.    The pool was huge with one slightly warmer and one cooler to refresh you. You had a huge bed and 2-4 pillows provided by the helpful pool man. He would move your umbrella throughout the day to keep you shaded if desired and gave you fresh towels each morning.    Breakfast had a good selection of eggs meats cheese bread croissants fruit etc. You'd be served fresh tea and coffee and orange or cucumber juice by the kind waiters. The lunch menu was nice - salads pastas burgers meat etc. There was a good choice of drinks and always complimentary bread.    There was a free taxi service to the medina each day which took 15mins at 9am 11am 3pm 5.30pm 7.30pm or 10pm as well as similar times for returns. We use to get the 7.30pm into town for dinner and an exploration of the souks and the final taxi back at 11.15pm which worked well.    The hotel provides excursions and lots of advice. They seemed a bit too pricey so we just went to the gardens and noticed local excursions much more reasonable.    We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a relaxing quiet and peaceful break close enough to the lively medina for evening exploring.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,BILL F wrote a review Jun 2016,50,Awesome hotel,This is the best hotel we have stayed in for years.From the minute we arrived late at night we were given a tour of the hotel and our bags delivered to the room.A great nights sleep and down to breakfast and a guided tour of the buffet by the restaurant manager the following morning showed the various choices from cooked food to a cold buffet which I imagine would cater for all tastes. Our original intention was to visit Marrakesh and eat but we enjoyed the hotel food that much we ate there every night! There is a gourmet menu with European type food and a Moroccan menu with different tajines and other Moroccan dishes which I lovedfood with a real taste!We ventured in to Marrakesh on one of the hottest days of the year on the free hotel shuttle busthe temperature reaching 42 degrees and we only lasted two hours before we got a taxi back to the sanctuary of the hotel and the air conditioning! About 15 quid for the fare which was very reasonable negotiated with the driver before the journey.We would have loved to have spent more time in Marrakesh but the extreme heat stopped all that!The staff in the hotel could not have been more helpful the owner and manager enquiring on a regular basis if there was anything they could do to improve our staybut the room was great everything worked and couldn't have been improved. The pool area is also very comfortableproper sun beds and towels brought to you by the attendants without asking!Thanks to Wassim and all the waiters for their smiles and patience and we would love to come back when it is a bit cooler!

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Joanne H wrote a review Jun 2016,50,Cannot recommend this hotel enough. Absolutely fabulous!,We are a family of four (2 children age 7 and 11). We have just returned from an 8 day stay at the Sirayane Hotel.    From the moment we arrived we felt completely relaxed and pampered. We were greeted on arrival with Moroccan tea and biscuits our boys were welcomed and told to make themselves at home    Our room was a double room with 2 camp beds for the children. It was plenty big enough for the four of us. A huge walk in shower and plenty of storage space. We had a private garden overlooking the pool.    There isn't much to do at the hotel but what is there is superb. The pool area is beautiful and tranquil surrounded by lush gardens. The pool man was so attentive knowing exactly where you liked to sit every day and made sure your towels were on the bed (which were huge and very comfy!).    The food was fantastic. Breakfast was plentiful. The fresh fruit was amazing. Lunch and dinner menus were large enough not to get bored with a mixture of Moroccan dishes and European. The waiters got to know what drinks you liked for breakfast and as soon as you sat down they were preparing them. Excellent service.    We took advantage of the free shuttle bus into Town and enjoyed a couple of day trips which the hotel offered.    A tranquil oasis only 10 minutes from town. I would definitely recommend this hotel and cannot wait to go back.

Did we find the best spot ever...... The Sirayane is just what you want it to be you can go on all sorts or expeditions in and around Marrakesh or like us you can cut yourself off from the rest of the world. The menu is amazing and they are willing to tailor it to your preferences and taste we were half board the breakfast was more than ample a nice leisurely buffet with lovely omelettes if you wanted cooked to order the waiters can't do enough to help you. No-one is in your face but if you need help or advice they are always there.  From the first moment you arrive the service and attention makes you feel very welcome. Nothing seems to big an ask although there isn't much you would really need the attention to detail gives it 5 stars the staff and management all get 5 stars. The GASTRONOMIC menu get 5 stars from us the peaceful surroundings gets 5 stars.

We arrived late Tuesday evening and were greeted at the airport with private transfer. Upon arrival we were made to feel incredibly welcome by the duty manager who insisted it would be no trouble to provide food despite being later than normal for the kitchen. The room was beautifully welcoming and large enough to accommodate four of us. Transportation into Marrakech was excellent. We enjoyed long leisurely lunches which were delicious.

The staff are very friendly the food is exceptional plenty on offer for the buffet breakfast and the evening meals were delightful. The rooms were clean the only niggle I have is that housekeeping was a bit hit and miss with replenishing items! the bottled water would appear in the evening rather than earlier in the day and sometimes the showergel wasnt replaced!

Great service was provided throughout our stay food was superb esp dinner both moroccan & international menus. Staff were very helpful and when our 9 monrh old daughter got tired they had the rest of the meal delivered to our room on more than one occasion. Stayed in the deluxe pool room and it was amazing pool was heated and rooms were really spacious well worth the extra bucks!  The rest of the resort pools & gardens were well kept and maintained rooms were spacious and clean couldn't fault anything during our stay. Plenty to do in the resort pool table/gym/tennis courts also they provide a free shuttle to the medina for anyone keen on visiting the souks again. Dont forget to book a spa package during your stay you won't regret it they also have a variety of treatments available. Thanks Anas and the rest of the team for making our stay with our 9 month old daughter so memorable.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Karon A wrote a review May 2016,50,Tranquil with superb service levels,So pleased we booked this hotel which is only about 15 minutes from the airport and it is just so tranquil. The rooms are clean and spacious but what stands out is the service. The staff can't do enough for you. We came back from lunch and the cushions and beds had been moved to ensure we were facing the sun. The chair was broken in our room and it was replaced with a new one after reporting it. The bed is very comfortable and rooms equipped with hairdryers kettle minibar. They offer a shuttle service to town which is about 10 minutes away. Also arranged a day tour for us which was excellent.    I visited the spa and recommend the Hammam massage to remove dead skin and prepare you for the days relaxing by the pool. Also had a relaxing massage and Indian head massage. All very professional and throughly enjoyed. This is an ideal location if you want to explore Marrakech town but want to stay somewhere peaceful with a lovely pool attentive and helpful staff in a beautiful setting. We will certainly think about returning to this hotel.    The hotel arranged transport from the airport and always replied promptly to our emails asking for assistance. The breakfast had a good selection and for lunch I recommend the beef skewers!,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kar0nA

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,379anita_m wrote a review May 2016,40,Good choice,Good choice if you don't want to be around the business of Marrakech itself. Hotel provides a free shuttle service to pop in and out. There isn't anything for tourists in the immediate area if your'e thinking you'd like to mooch to other places in the area. We didn't mind this because the hotel is set up in such a way that you can lounge around.  Had several treatments and the main pool (not the smaller heated one) is lovely. Rooms are good restaurant caters well enough for veggies - although you'll find it cheaper to eat in town. The hotel has under-used gardens they could be a bit more creative with this space. Staff are helpful and friendly.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,SafferB wrote a review May 2016,50,Strongly strongly recommend....,Just checked out after an amazing week at the Sirayane.    This is a truly exceptional hotel booked through Expedia.    Received a confirmatory email following booking our airport pick up in advance.    Check in was fast and efficient. As a Expedia VIP member we received a complimentary upgrade to a garden suite.    The room was spacious and airy with direct access to a private garden. Bathroom was well equipped and clean.  Bedding towels all of good quality and very comfortable. Room was well serviced with very professional cleaners.    Breakfast was really good with an excellent selection of western and morrocan dishes. Service was exceptional all round.    The pool was wonderful with very attentive pool staff. They knew where you liked to be and would set up the beds with towels and parasol if required in advance. If like me you use a parasol the pool attendents would constantly move it as the sun moved during the day.  The sunbeds are large and comfortable with cushions.  The pool bar staff again very attentive and would remember your preferred drinks and snacks.    The hotel is about a 15 minute drive from the Medina. A complimentary shuttle is offered throughout the day which allows you to enjoy the madness of the Medina and souks while escaping to the sanctuary of the hotel after.    The spa offers an excellent array of treatments and very reasonably priced.  I had the traditional morrocan hammam and scrub followed by an amazing massage. I eventually had 3 further massages during our stay.  The ladies are highly skilled and very professional. Again very friendly and polite.    A wonderful hotel whose greatest asset are it's amazing staff. Extremely friendly and professional and exemplify excellent customer service in its true sense.    A heartfelt thank you to the management and all staff.    We both fell in love with Marakech and will definitely return. We will most definitely stay at the Sirayane on our return.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,JULIE D wrote a review May 2016,50,Stunning Sirayane,My friend and I spent a week at the beginning of May 2016 and I have to say that this hotel is a luxury paraidise for the ideal chill out holiday. The staff could not be anymore accommodating - esp Soufian one of the waiters for whom nothing was ever too much.He was very sincere and provided us with all the information with the amenities about the hotel. From the owner Midget who personally spoke to each guest every single day - always checking that eahc persons stay was perfect to all of the restuarant/reception (and Adil and Aleana in particular) aswell as the poolside and SPA staff - I have to say made you feel special from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. We had a mini suite with a private garden but did not feel the need to use it as the peacful poolside with the very comfortable sunbeds ticked all the boxes for us. We ventured out a couple of nights with our own driver ensuring we where dropped off and picked up safely - but enjoyed the exstensive menu that was on offer in the restaurant - Suite was spacious and immaculate and cleaned to a high standard every day - .A massive thank you to Midget and his staff for a wonderful holiday - would recommend and would certainly return.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Aberdeen, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/705julied
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,lewisam wrote a review May 2016,50,Amazing amazing amazing but don't tell everyone !,I can't rate this hotel highly enough. When we were planning our trip we didn't want a large resort hotel like the sofitel or four seasons and we also didn't want a small Riad so this hotel was a perfect alternative right in the middle. It only has 28 rooms and we had 3 balcony rooms for our stay. From the moment we checked in to when we left yesterday the service and personal touches were amazing. Firstly the rooms - we had a balcony room which had 2 single beds and a lovely modern bathroom. They like to shower the room with rose petals which is a nice touch and the decor is modern. Then around the pool are the rooms with gardens and the rooms with pools. They looked really nice and when we return we would certainly look to book one of the garden rooms. Breakfast is complimentary and has a good variety from omelettes to order to fruit yogurts and toast etc. We ate both lunch and dinner at the restaurant and the quality and value of the food was exceptional. The pool - They have lovely comfy square beds and a pool man that remembers your preferences every day so when you come out the pool your beds are already made up ready for you. They are also very attentive and if you have a parasol will continually move this throughout the day to ensure you are shaded if required as the sun moves !!! On our last day we needed a late check out for 7pm and they were very accommodating by letting us have one of the 3 rooms up until that point. The free bus to the medina is also a bonus as a taxi is approx 200 - 250 dirhams. I will definitely be back to this hotel and whilst it's outside of the main town it's tranquil and relaxing but only a 15 minute bus ride from the mayhem of the town centre.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Chester,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lewisam

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,TheRealTriv wrote a review May 2016,50,What a fantastic place,If I won the lottery I'd live here!  The perfect place to relax and unwind.  The hotel is not too big with 28 rooms it can never be crowded. There is plenty of space to be alone yet enough staff for one to appear as if by magic when required.  The emphasis here is on relaxation and that is exactly what you do without trying.    The room we had was clean and spacious with a private balcony and incredible views of the snow capped Atlas mountains to wake up to every morning.  The bed was without doubt the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in.  The bathroom was excellent.  The rooms are cleaned efficiently and properly and there's a turn down service in the evening which just makes you feel that little bit special.    Nothing was ever too much trouble for any of the staff and the owner is on site making life very easy indeed.    Food was plentiful and excellent as you'd expect. With both a Moroccan and French menu to choose from as well as chef accepting requests you can't go wrong.    Grounds are well kept with many trees flowers and bushes and plenty of birds.    They have an environmental policy which is comforting and helps make the place feel a little more personal.    The spa was a great diversion from all the stress of laying around in the sun!    I'm trying to come up with something negative or neutral to say about the place just so that this review doesn't sound like was paid for but I can't and it wasn't.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Otk13 wrote a review May 2016,40,Relaxing Break,We visited The Sirayane Hotel this week (May 2016) and I have to say this hotel was great very nearly the full 5 stars.. I would rate 4.5.    The positives:    - Beautiful grounds and surrounding Atlas Mountains  - Free regular shuttle to the Medina  - Heated pool  - Attentive staff  - Excellent Housekeeping  - Tennis courts    The negatives for us:    - Service charge of 10% on everything including spa treatments and even the mini bar! Adds up over a week..  - No local shop for snacks or water and the hotel requests you do not bring these in (although was never actually mentioned to us and we still did)... Water is expensive at the hotel compared to town but inevitably you will require some.  - We got two 'random' phone calls to our room very early in the morning (6:30 & 8) however the hotel explained that at least one of these occasions must have been other guests calling us.    Overall though a very relaxing and welcoming experience. We would definitely return to this hotel and loved that it was away from the hectic nature of the city centre. Nice touches like the man who lays towels down on your sunbed and makes sure you are adequately shaded throughout the day as well as the turn down service which includes a bottle of water roses and some biscuits. We only ate at the hotel once but the food was good albeit more expensive than in the town.

I worried before we went that it would be too small but it was perfect. There was never a problem getting a sunbed...and they were the most comfy sunbeds ive ever laid on. After a few days the pool boys get to know were you like to lie and the towels are laid on the beds for you. If you get up to adjust the parasol they were there doing it for you. Only one restaurant but more than enough choice to have something different each day. All the staff could have been more friendly and attentive. We had a room with a garden but felt we didn't really need it. We only used it to dry swim wear!! The pool area was so nice we just went there every day. I had a facial one day and we both had a massage on another...pure bliss. We did go into the Medina one afternoon as we were booked into a restaurant on the night.....very hot busy and noisy...I was very glad to get back to the piece and quiet of the hotel.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Noor M wrote a review Apr 2016,50,The most relaxed holiday ever!,The Sirayane is truly a little haven for relaxation whereby you never get the feeling of being overcrowded like you do with most hotels. The hotel has been decorated with a modern and luxurious feel which made the experience a lot more enjoyable.    Upon arrival we were greeted with fresh mint tea and biscuits whilst our check in was processed very rapidly. To my surprise we got upgraded to a villa with a private garden and direct access to the pool. I highly suggest booking this room which had a TV DVD player seating area and much more! The rooms were incredibly clean and maintained daily. Slippers bathrobes and toiletries were provided.    The hotel also organised our excursion to Ait Benhaddou hotel transfers and shuttle service into the Medina. I have to give a special mention to our driver (provided by the hotel) who was incredibly welcoming and made us feel like family. He was very patient during my many stops for pictures and always ensured that we were happy before dropping us of to any location. He was also very informative of the locations we visited which was incredibly helpful.    Overall I have to give a massive thank you to all of the staff at the hotel who made our stay memorable by providing us with a scrumptious breakfast buffet everyday and working all the way through to dinner. The food here is cooked to perfection I highly recommend their steak. On our first night the manager personally came over and introduced himself during dinner and ensured we knew he was there for any queries & requests we had.    The Spa is a must stop for everyone! The staff were very pleasant and suggested the treatments that were best suited to us. The actual spa package itself was very relaxing.    I want to say a final thank you to everyone for making our first trip to Marrakech a memorable one I have only just checked out today and I already can't wait to come back to the Sirayane!,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noorm522

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,M R wrote a review Apr 2016,50,Perfect for a relaxed week in the sun,"Wish I was back there!  We had a great week in the sun. The room was great worth having a mini suite for the extra space and facilities. We blew a fuze around 11pm but someone was out to fix it straight away. The staff couldn't have been more helpful from the pool guys moving the parasols & providing extra pillows waiting staff and reception always being on hand and our tour guide helping push my wheelchair during our city tour.  I overhead one British couple saying the hotel was nice but not 5*. Now it may not be a ""British 5* like the Ritz"" but it was certainly 5* in service and I couldn't fault the hotel.  The free shuttle is a great service as its fun to go into the Medina for an evening or for dinner. I enjoyed the Moroccan menu in the hotel but it was also fun to eat out.  If you are looking for a relaxed week in the sun with great service this is the place for you.  All the staff speak English and French. No external food or drink is allowed in but the costs are reasonable and you get free water each day.  Breakfast was great. Big choice and we filled up each morning so didn't need lunch.  Lots of birds particularly Sparrows. Enjoyable watching them nesting.",Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Edinburgh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrl789
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Katie L wrote a review Apr 2016,50,A week in paradise,We came to Sirayane because of the reviews and we were not disappointed. The staff are all extremely helpful they can't do enough for you. We arrived very late at night but we were personally greeted by one of the assistant managers with Moroccan tea (yum!) and a welcome/explanation of the hotel before a guided tour. We were then taken to our room to find we had been upgraded to a mini suite - a wonderful surprise. Our bags had already been delivered to the room for us. The week continued like this the staff were all friendly and helpful. The room was lovely the bed comfy and the food also to a good standard. Every night the bed would be turned down with fresh rose petals and a bottle of water each by the bed; all lovely touches. Breakfast was great with fresh fruit and pastries and eggs to order. The general manager came to ask us about our stay and check that we were happy on more than one occasion. A shuttle bus to and from the medina several times each day was provided and we certainly made the most of it. Overall the Sirayane is a little piece of paradise and a welcome escape from the liveliness of Marrakech. I can't find any faults and would be back at the drop of a hat.

My wife and our young family travelled to the Sirayane for 5 nights staying in a suite with a private pool.    Initially I was quite concerned about visiting Marrakech with my young family. However our stay could not have been more relaxing the staff showed genuine affection for the children and catered for their every need and ours.    The food was excellent but in terms of quality and value. My children are very fussy and nothing was too much for the staff.    The hotel organized complimentary transfers to the medina and provided great advice on trips and places for us all to visit.    Our flight was late in the evening and although our suite was rebooked Medhi very kindly found us an alternative that meant we could stay in the comfort of the hotel until the flight.    I can‚Äôt recommend the hotel Medhi and his team highly enough we can't wait to visit the hotel again next year.

We dined at several of the five star hotels during our stay (at last count there were 97 five star hotels in the city!) and each and every time we felt thankful for booking Sirayene. It is perfect in every way. The rooms are spacious and immaculate and we had an extra super comfy bed for our son (we stayed in the mini suite). The staff couldnt' have been more helpful friendly welcoming and always greet you with a smile no matter how late in the night or early in the day. Breakfast is varied generous always fresh and utensils and dishes are freshened regularly. The lunch menu is varied and they have catered for my gluten intolerance impressively (i had freshly baked gluten-free bread every morning!). The shuttle service was great we used it everyday and each day we ventured out into the medina we were happy to come back to the tranquility of the hotel and the chirping birds.

Actually we could have stayed here all week. There were multiple free shuttles to the Medina daily and other excursions from the hotel. However the experience of staying in a Riad is not to be missed for 2-3 nights max. All the staff at the Sirayane were very friendly and attentive including the owner and assistant manager who were always around to made sure you have everything you need. The food was exceptional quality and reasonably priced but more expensive than the Medina. We both had spa treatments which were also very good. We got an upgrade on arrival to a mini suite which was a nice surprise the bed was massive! Very much enjoyed our stay here.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Benbojobo wrote a review Apr 2016,50,An oasis of calm in beautiful surroundings.....!!!,We stayed at the Sirayane in November 2013 and enjoyed it so much we returned again in 2015.    On both occasions the staff were attentive without being over bearing yet always on hand to provide faultless service whether its the pool boy the restaurant staff or reception staff particularly Salah. The owner of the hotel Mehdi took time out of his day to welcome every guest which made us feel extremely welcome.    The hotel is approximately 10-15 minutes from Marrakech city they also offer a free shuttle bus which runs every day great for day trips to the medina. Also close by is Gueliz which is a more cosmopolitan area of Marrakesh great restaurants and nightlife (some of which we returned to during our second visit to the city).    On both occasions we stayed in the pool villa which is completely private with a fairly sizeable pool. The rooms are clean and fresh towels provided each day as well as bottled drinking water.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Sara W wrote a review Apr 2016,50,A hotel doesn't get any better..,In my opinion ..  If you are going to Marrakech this is the perfect place to stay! The combination of a fata-morgana paradise with free shuttle-enabled trips to the busy and chaotic but wonderful c√≠ty center is optimal for a 5 days (or any) get-away. Sirayane offers all you need- it's 5-star facilities and surroundings are combined with a high-level service but still relaxed atmosphere. The personnel are the most attentive sweet and service-minded I have ever met- and I have been to many hotels around the world. The food is good the spa excellent and prices are reasonable. We were fortunate to stay in one of the 'villas'- they are absolutely recommendable as you have your own little garden with flowers sun-chairs etc. We will be back!!!

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Irish_Traveller105 wrote a review Apr 2016,50,Dont hesitate to stay here.,Stayed here for 5 nights over Easter and was really impressed. I travel a lot and always stay in 4 and 5 * properties and this holds its own in the luxury boutique market in my view.    The property is beautiful a real haven away from the hustle of town and lovely to come back to after spending some time in the Souks or having dinner in town. It has a real luxury feel with the added comfort of rigorous but not invasive security procedures that help you to feel secure and taken care of.    The rooms are spacious (we had both a mini suite and a junior suite with Private pool). Both were of a high standard with the bathroom areas in both being a real stand out - especially in the junior suite. The private pool in the junor suite was lovely - heated for the time of year and big enough for two to comfortably enjoy some privacy in.    The main pool area is beautiful lots of sun loungers which were really comfortable and topped off by extremely attentive pool staff. In fact - the staff across the board are whats sets the hotel aside. As other reviewers have commented - they really go out of their way to make your hotel stay as comfortable as possible - they address you by name know your room number reference your plans for the day and your preferences for drinks pool beds food etc. I was really impressed across the board.    We ate breakfast every day which was excellent - great variety of hot and cold buffet available and the option of fresh cooked eggs omelettes etc. Lunch is good - could perhaps be a little more varied but again very good quality. We ate dinner one night and it was very good - expensive by comparison to places in town but its not fair to compare - its a great option if you just want to spend a full day at the hotel. Nice bar area with good cocktail list.    We used the spa which is beautiful great treatments and reasonably priced - a real haven of tranquility.    There is a regular shuttle service to Marrakesh downtown (about 6 returns a day) and if the timing doesn't suit the hotel will arrange a taxi with direct charge to your room. We also used a hotel organised transfer to/from the airport and it was great - very good service and only short 15 minute drive from the airport to the hotel.    Overall I was very happy with my stay and would highly recommend anyone to stay here. We look forward to returning to this special property in the future. Thanks again to all the staff for making our stay so memorable and in particular Yusef in reception - you really do go above and beyond to know your guests it made a real difference.,Date of stay: March 2016,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Irish_Traveller105

The hotel has some fantastic amenities such as the spa swimming pools tennis courts and for those wanting to venture out I was surprised to find they had a free shuttle running at various times to the Medina.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Athenablue wrote a review Mar 2016,50,A beautiful 5 star oasis,There is nothing not to like about the tranquil beautiful Sirayane. My husband's birthday is in March so we went for a special birthday treat and could not have wished for more.  The staff are all so friendly and attentive without being intrusive you are made to feel so welcome from the moment you arrive. Our accommodation was superb spacious and clean with our own terrace leading to the pool area.  Every morning we were spoilt for choice with the buffet breakfast. Moroccan specialities pastries fresh fruit hot cold healthy indulgent all there to tempt you. We loved the company of the sparrows on the restaurant terrace and couldn't help dropping a few pieces of croissant much to their delight!  Perfectly situated away from the hustle and bustle of the main town you can choose to laze by the pool all day sipping cocktails and snacking on the accompanying olives and nuts heading into the shade of the restaurant for lunch. Or you can take the free shuttle bus service into town retuning as late as 11:15 giving plenty of time to explore shop and eat an evening meal in one of the many local restaurants.  If you fancy a change of scenery there are a number of excursions arranged by the hotel. A private car with driver for the day will take you and be your guide for the day if you so wish. We took a day trip to Essouaria quite a long drive at 2.5 hours away but a nice place to visit with a more chilled vibe than manic Marrakesh.  I must give a special mention to Lamia and the rest of the reception team who are wonderful and will help you arrange anything you need. I wanted to book a special restaurant for Paul's birthday and Lamia suggested the Comptoir... which did not disappoint complete with 'surprise' birthday cake.  The spa is amazing and the girls there are all so professional and friendly Bastie especially who gave me the BEST pedicure I have ever had!  All in all a wonderful place which we will have no hesitation to return to hopefully soon.  Thank you all so much we are lucky to say that we now have a home in Marrakesh.

The hotel grounds are lovely - we took advantage of the large swimming pool and tennis court.  The restaurant is nice serving well cooked traditional food - as with any hotel it's more expensive than a meal in town but this shouldn't be a surprise.  The breakfast buffet has everything you might need - both sweet and savoury options plus a great range of fruit and yoghurts. The kitchen also offers omelettes upon request.    Our room was one with a terrace only (no private garden/pool) and it was always clean and kept to a good standard - the bed was made twice a day which was lovely.  It has everything you'll need including a mini bar and DVD set.    They offer a shuttle bus to and from the old town a few times a day which is quite convenient. It would have been great if the shuttle also made a stop in the new town - maybe something to consider for the future.    We used the private transfer to a destination of our choice for one of the evenings as the shuttle times weren't convenient for our reservation - we were happy with the service. The driver was very polite and friendly and the journey was pleasant. It costs ‚Ç¨20 each way so it's not the cheapest option if you're on a budget but it is convenient.

All of the staff are really wonderful and greet you at the door like old friends every time you return from a day out. The cleaners came in and straightened up the room several times a day.    Lovely toiletries fluffy dressing gowns and huge comfy bed. There's free wifi a tv air con and heating dvd player and selection of free DVDs. We slept well but were woken up at about 6am every morning by very loud birds who like to perch on the balconies! Maybe bring earplugs.    The lobby areas are lovely with a library open fireplace free computer and stylish bar area and restaurant.    Outside there's a tennis court small heated pool and larger unheated pool free outdoor wifi big double sun loungers free beach towels parasols plenty of sun and shaded areas and nice chilled out music. The staff leap up and help you if there's anything you need they're very keen to help and the poolside waiting service with free olives and nuts was a lovely touch.    Breakfast was great with loads of choice. The food at the restaurant in the evening was delicious - but a little bit pricey. Instead we opted for the free shuttle bus in the evening which took us to the souks where there are hundreds of restaurants to choose from.    We really did have a fantastic stay - the hotel was beautiful and spotless and the staff were extremely friendly but not at all intrusive. The weather was brilliant - wall to wall sunshine everyday!!    Our only problem was the shower... which was cold most of the time. They kept sending engineers to fix it but their solutions were only temporarily. Eventually they sent us to the spa to have showers there instead and also offered us free massages at the spa to compensate. On our penultimate day they finally offered for us to change to another room - but they really should have offered this straight away. They extended our room to 4pm free of charge in our last day but unfortunately before our flight the shower didn't work and there was no one in the spa to let us in so I had to have a freezing cold shower to wash off the sunscreen!    However the staff cared very much about the situation with the shower - they were hopeful to fix it and kept trying different things. The manager and owner seemed very concerned and wanted to make sure we were happy. I felt really sorry for them that they couldn't get it fixed! They were really genuinely concerned about the happiness of the guests.    We would definitely return and recommend this hotel but wouldn't want room 101!    Tip: don't get your money changed in England!

As everyone else says we were welcomed with amazing mint tea (and this is from someone who doesn't even drink tea). Bags were taken to our room. The first impressions were really amazing of the hotel. We had a slight problem in that the water was cold when we first used it but they immediately sent a plumber who fixed it and had no issues thereafter    In terms of facilities:  Bed--was very comfortable and the room was cleaned every day and petals were added to the room  Bathroom -- powerful water and lovely oils soaps included  Room--very spacious to put our things. They even added a cot for our 2 year old  Balcony-amazing views of the pool gardens sunset Atlas mountains  Spa- didn't have time to try it but the rooms looked really clean and relaxing  Sports room- pool table (20dh) and a chance to watch any sports if you have time  Chill out area- they have a PC to use and a fire place  WiFi- excellent and available throughout the hotel  Gym- had decent amount of equipment though didn't have time to use it  DVDs- range of DVDs available to watch films in your room  Tennis court- lovely little court. Couldn't really play as it rained a bit the night before and was windy  Swimming pool- I used this everyday and the pool was nice and warm.  Breakfast- great amount of choice. Loved the orange juice and croissants.  Staff- extremely helpful and kind. Manager always around asking if we needed anything and if we were happy.  Shuttle bus- easy to book and the journey takes 20 mins to the centre.  Food- I didn't try lunch or dinner here as we ate out every day    Overall- definitely worth a 5*. I would maybe love to see if they could maybe add some water slides to the pool in the future as that would be attractive for the kids. Otherwise no complains.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,cyclingmad2011 wrote a review Feb 2016,50,Fantastic!,We visited the Sirayane in October last year what a wonderful peaceful hotel. The staff could not be faulted and the room was amazing!    We had a mix up with our booking having booked via a third party we were expecting a junior suite with pool but ended up with a garden room (really no hardship) on our last night we received a complimentary upgrade and we were delighted.    This is a certainly a resort that caters more for adults which suited us just fine the food was lovely we enjoyed every moment of our stay.    If I was to find fault with anything it would be the cocktails they were very hit and miss in terms of taste.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,kevnick80 wrote a review Feb 2016,50,One of the finest boutique hotels in the world,My husband and I have just come back from a four night stay here at the Sirayane and we can say without a doubt it was one of the best hotels we have ever stayed at. We are used to staying in 5* establishments but this surpasses the majority.    From the moment we arrived (greeted with gorgeous mint tea) to the tour around the hotel and finally to our deluxe pool villa/suite the staff could not do enough for us pre-empting our every move and surprising us throughout the stay.    The villa was absolutely beautiful and having our own enclosed garden with pool and seating area was the epitome of luxury we didn't want to leave (except to sample the delicious food conjured up by the restaurant.    The staff make this hotel. Nothing is ever too much trouble (we asked for a box to take the remainder of our meal back to the room - they prepared it on a silver some platter and walked it to our suite) and they display a genuine interest in making sure your stay is nothing but hassle free. The standout is Soufiane he was always on hand to ask if we needed anything always remembered what our preferences were at breakfast where we liked to be seated etc etc. For example we had bought something from the souk and it was not packaged well enough by them - he took his motorbike into town to collect some packing material and sellotape (on his own time) and made sure it was packed well enough to endure the plane journey back. The manager (I have forgotten your name - sorry) also helped in taping up the package with our address details so he has to be commended too.    We are currently planning a visit for the same time next year we can't wait to return to our paradise in the sun!,Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevnick80
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,ElaineG867 wrote a review Feb 2016,50,Short Break to Marrakech,We wanted a short break with some sunshine without spending hours on a plane and came up with Marrakech. After reading other reviews on Tripadvisor we opted for staying at the Sirayane Boutique Hotel and Spa approximately a 10/15 minutes drive away from all the hustle and bustle of the city. We were so glad that we stayed here.  The number of rooms is small (approx 26) with some being part of the main hotel and the others are garden rooms situated around a fabulous pool area. Don't let this fool you though. The hotel has all the amenities of a much larger hotel without the crowds and service is more personal. We splashed out on a room with its own private pool and garden area. Our pool was heated to 27 degrees so can be used all year round. If you had opted for any of the other rooms though I don't think that you would be disappointed. The hotel main pool is huge with a smaller all year round heated one and plenty of large beds to lounge around on.  The breakfast buffet is extensive with something to suit everyone from traditional Moroccan fayre to freshly cooked to order omelettes. We ate dinner at the restaurant for 2 evenings opting for the Moroccan inspired menu but if you preferred some more western food then that was available too. Both meals were delicious and came to approx ¬£25/ ¬£30 a head for 2/3 courses and a glass of wine and bottle of water.  Service was exceptional throughout our stay friendly and efficient but never over bearing. All staff speak English to a good level although if you want to practice your French then feel free!  My husband chose to have a spa treatment an hours relaxing massage. He really enjoyed it and it cost approx ¬£30 so good value. There was an extensive range of treatments available at reasonable prices for a hotel spa.  There is a complementary shuttle bus departing from the hotel to the city and back 6 times a day with the first departing at 9.30 and the last one at 22.30. This just needs to be arranged 2 hours before your chosen departure time. Trips can also be arranged as can departures back to the airport.  We would just like to thank all the staff for a wonderful stay and we hope to be back.,Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"West Sussex, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElaineG867

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Marie H wrote a review Feb 2016,50,Holiday for 1 week,This is a fabulous place to stay.  Although it is a 20 min journey from Marakesh the free shuttle bus made it no problem at all.  The accommodation is excellent with clean fresh white cotton bedding sheets and our room also had its own private pool and garden.  The staff are friendly and attentive and nothing is too much trouble.  The food and restaurant service is excellent with good choices of traditional Moroccon or alternative menu.  I would highly recommend this hotel if you want a quiet sunny civilised getaway.  We travelled with Thompson and would also recommend the atlas mountain tour and visiting the local gardens tour and the Moroccon evening with entertainment.  The haman on site in the hotel itself is preferable to the organised Thompson one in Marrakesh and is much more professional and clean with much better facilities.  Busty the masseur and manicurist (from Senegal) was delightful company and interesting to chat to.

The hotel is located out of the city centre so away from the noise and pollution that comes with most city breaks however when you then look up and see the clear sky full of stars well this is a priceless moment.    The facilities on site are excellent from a spa to a well equipped gym but would highly recommend you take advantage of the restaurant to sample the chefs creations. Winking tiger for one.  The staff were both very professional and friendly and always on hand to ensure you enjoy your stay there.    The hotel offers free wi fi throughout the hotel grounds and in the rooms and being as I was travelling on business this ensured I was connected all the time to my relief so could enjoy my stay there more.

We eventually found the tablets in my glasses case (which the cleaners had also moved!!)    I'd still come back to this hotel but would request that no belongings are touched.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Andy B wrote a review Feb 2016,50,This has the WOW factor!!,I visited the Hotel with my wife as a surprise 50th birthday present for her.  Our flight was with EasyJet and they were great.  Met at the airport by the hotel car & driver who was helpful and very cheerful. He spoke good English. We arrived late afternoon via a dirt track. My wife Carole had a look of horror on her face but as soon as we turned into the hotel gates & into the courtyard her face changed to a broad smile!  The management greeted us in perfect English offered us a glass of Morocan tea & then showed us around the hotel. This is definately 5 star! We were then showed our suite and the huge 6ft bed was showered in rose petals which set the scene for the 4 night 'birthday' break.  The breakfast & staff who also spoke perfect Englishwere A1! The poolside was policed by the Pool Butler who ran round to us as we approached the sun beds armed with towels and gave us 2 cushions each for our heads plus a table each. There are 2 pools one was heated!  The evening meals were either Morocan or European and were so tasty with such a wide choice! The staff were extremely helpful and again spoke perfect English.  At night the bed was turned down & a rose placed on the duvet. Every day the hotel owner came over to us to have a chat and see if there were any problems which there weren't!  We had perfect weather each day with low to middle 20's which to us was hot compared to the weather we had left behind in Stoke!  Overall we had a fabulous mini break I gained plenty of browny points and we've been left with wonderful memories!

From the minute we were picked up at the airport to the most attentive staff nothing was to much bother. As for the food? it was some of the finest I've ever eaten. Like someone else has said and summed it up beautifully it really is an oasis of tranquillity in what can be a crazy old city! Its a perfect base for exploring this country or just to kick back and relax and soak up some beautiful Moroccan sun. I came here with my two brothers and both were also blown away.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Carole B wrote a review Feb 2016,50,Fantastic in every way,This hotel was booked by my husband as a surprise for my 50th birthday.  On arrival at the airport we were met by our hotel transport a very helpful friendly guy who loaded our luggage. 15 minute driver from airport to a uneven road with waste land to one side I was not sure what I was expecting. (Ramshackle shack popped into my head) then turning through wooden gates the WOW factor hit.  A gorgeous courtyard steps leading to a huge door. Luggage unloaded and greeted with local tea shown around and then to our rooms luggage already there.  Room very clean and well laid out. A special extra courtesy of the hotel petals nicely scattered around the bed and room.  The menu is Devine both for lunch and dinner staff are exceptional friendly and speak good English will accommodate food preferences. Both Moroccan and European food available. Breakfast has everything available and all fantastic.    The steam room is only available if you book it very clean (extremely hot floor)  The massages (facial and then an Oriental full massage) both were very good and reasonably priced.  The grounds of the hotel are very tidy and well kept.  The pool (heated) clean and warm only brave enough to dip toes into other pool. The Pool butler was immediately on hand with towels extra cushions and table.    We booked a trip to Marrakesh with a guide booked through the hotel. Great having the local knowledge and we saw the non tourist sights. Exceptionally good English.    The day of my 50th my husband had arranged flowers and cake which were bought to our table by our smiling waiter everything was extra special and a memory I will never forget.    Every night the sheet was turned down and a rose on the bed.  All the staff were always smiling nothing was to much trouble and they all seemed to know what you needed and it was on hand before you'd spoken to them.    The hotel has everything needed for a complete relaxing break.  Would I recommend this hotel?

In a nutshell the best hotel we've stayed in despite visiting many 5* hotels in the middle east. It is small and benefits from great attention to detail. Personally after a few hours in the hubbub of the city this is a beautiful haven to return to. Don't bother with independent airport transfers the hotel transfer is good value and a great start and end to the holiday. We made good use of the free hotel shuttle minibus in and out of the city at various times during the day. Also wonderful hamman and back massage.

Down an untidy side road we didn't know what to expect and when we arrived there was a workman outside a huge closed door up some steps. We looked at each other in shock then suddenly the door was opened by a smartly dressed and smiling young man and it just got better and better from that moment onwards.  The door opened up to a beautiful interior leading to a wide open patio 2 pools relaxing day beds and wonderful single storey suites round the pool area.  Every member of staff put themselves at our beck and call with open honest friendliness and good humour. We had a wonderful time in the hotel enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere the food was enjoyable though slightly overpriced but let me say that our suite was well worth the price.

We met an older couple who made us laugh so much from sharing experiences of their stay. The excursions also are a good rate and very well worth the prices as they include transport to and from the hotel. The best thing of our stay was the junior suite with the private heated swimming pool. We had suite 118. Left me speechless. Well worth the money by far. Can't wait to come back!!!

But first of all this was my first visit to Marrakech and I would have prefer to be closer to the city center. This Hotel is not near and I saw they had a Shuttle Servicewich must specify it has a very strange schedule where I could not use once since also has to be booked two hour in advance. I mean if I go on vacation want things to be easier. They had like 2 shuttles in the morning and then late afternoon. So they really must do something since a taxi from the city can be 200 Dirhmas and it has to be with a Grand Taxi. Room was ok. But the bathroom layout was not as practical it has a very big shower but with no doorvery small hand wash and count. The worst part of staying here was the Wifi. In the room I had no reception what so ever neither Wifi.

The hotel shuttle bus collects you from the airport a 15 minute journey and you can book one of five shuttle buses to the old city each day (the new city is not worth bothering about). The rooms are very spacious and comfortable with private gardens that lead into the pool area. Staff were very friendly and spa is excellent.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,akathrada80 wrote a review Jan 2016,50,Outstanding Hotel,My husband and I stayed in a junior suite at the Sirayane Boutique hotel and absolutely loved it. The staff throughout the hotel were extremely welcoming and couldn't do enough for us. Breakfast offered a wide variety of warm and cold options and we didn't get bored of it throughout our 5 day stay.    As we stayed in the Junior suite we had a private garden and pool. This wasn't overlooked at all.    The room itself was very large and modern. The staff came by twice a day to clean the room.    They had a free shuttle bus into the centre which made a massive difference. It meant there was no hassle having to catch taxis and saved us lots!    The manager was always around and was very approachable.    I would refinately recommend this hotel and hopefully will return in the future.,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Greater Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/akathrada80
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,apple112 wrote a review Jan 2016,50,Perfect,We loved our 7 day stay at the Sirayane. We booked the luxury suite with a private pool and when we checked in my mum was upgraded to the adjoining garden suite so we could all be together. Thanks so much for this kind gesture.  The room was great lovely bathroom mattress a bit firm but nothing to worry about. Having our own pool (which was covered at night to keep the warmth in) was perfect for the kids to swim in all day long. We had great weather 23/24 for new year does me! The breakfast was good the service friendly and attentive and the lunch and evening meals we had are were top notch. We used the gym the spa(lovely massages) and even the little sports bar for the footie.  For peace and quiet it's perfect but the free and frequent shuttle buses made a few hours in the mad medina no problem at all. Don't be put off by those who moan it's too hectic in Jemaa el-fna I was with my wife who's pregnant my mum who's 68 and our kids who are 6 and 10 and we were happy as.  I think we'll return thanks to all the staff for making our stay spot on.

We spent 3 nights at the hotel and the whole experience was absolutely fantastic. I had arranged all specifics of the booking directly with the hotel including airport transfers and spa packages for our stay. The service from the hotel staff and the ladies at the spa was impeccable and they were always really helpful and always had a smile on their faces. Their recommendations with regards to local attractions etc was really helpful and they took the time out to cater for any requests we had. The room we had was lovely and we had been upgraded to this room which we were really grateful for.

We booked it after seeing excellent reviews and as expected the service was great and staff were helpful. We had a pool suite which was nice but not impressive it missed the luxury feel. The toiletries provided had a cheap feel shampoo was combined with shower gel. As vegetarians who don't eat eggs we requested for an alternative for breakfast. They were able to accommodate this on our last day after we had already had our breakfast which was disappointing. As a positive they were extremely helpful in organising a last minute excursion after our original booking fell through and the driver was great.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,ShurlockHomes wrote a review Dec 2015,50,A Quiet Little Paradise outside Marrakech,Had the opportunity to re-book and stay at this hotel for our 2nd visit to Marrakech. I got a great deal on 3x junior suites with half board (breakfast and evening meal) for 5 people. We also included an airport pickup to/from Menara Airport.    This hotel is a small boutique style hotel for 60 people roughly about 10-15 mins from the centre of Marrakech and the hotel offers free shuttle bus to the centre of town 6 times a day starting at 09:00am and the last return shuttle is 23:15pm from the centre.    The rooms are spacious and well equipped and there is good access to the pool. The views of the Atlas mountains are truly magical and it is worth getting up early to see the sun rise over the Atlas.    Tours and adventures can also be organised from the front desk both off the shelf and bespoke. We did both. One day we just organised a driver and he took us to the sights of our choice and another day we did quad biking with a company called Quad Marrakech Evasion...a really fun day btw for me and our boys.    The staff are extremely pleasant and helpful and if you stay there more than once they are highly likely to remember you which is a nice touch. I would especially like to call out the following people who helped us during our stay. Mehdi (General Manager) Bada (Customer Relations) Anas (Restaurant Manager) and Nada Adil and Amal on the reservations and front desk. Thanks also to our driver Omar and the chaps working in the restaurant Zidane Ismail Tehteh Tanan Mohammed & Soufiane. Everyone provided top class service to us and all our wants and needs were satisfied.    Food is good and they offer a varied menu both Moroccan style and Western as your palate dictates.    The location is quiet so it is a good place to chill and relax should you be looking for that. I would recommend this place to stay if you are travelling to Marrakech.,Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Reading, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShurlockHomes

I highly recommend it to anyone who is going to Marrakech the place is 10-15 minutes drive from the airport and is 15-20 minutes drive away from the city which was in our case better to get to enjoy the complete serenity the hotel offers. Plus the hotel provides a free shuttle service throughout the day from and to the city.  I am not usually a review writer but for this hotel i couldn't wait to get home and write about it.

The hotel is not cheap which is something to bear in mind as there are a lot of all inclusives in Marrakech which if you like to drink on your holiday is something to consider as alcohol is very expensive here however staff are great and will do anything they can for you particularly the owner who is always on site to see how you are enjoying your staff.

The resort was nice and decently modern with amazing service from staff. For breakfast our coffee/tea/juice were constantly replenished without even asking and when we laid by the pool our umbrella was constantly moved as the sun moved also done without us asking. We also did a private excursion to see the mountains Berber village and argan oil which was essentially the whole day and our driver was very nice and courteous and stopped whenever we wanted to take a picture.    There is decent options at the restaurant for meals but we went to eat at the Medina/New Town quite a bit I don't think I would be able to eat there 5 days straight.

We stayed on a HB basis the food was delicious. They offered the flexibility of both a European and Moroccan menu and the staff happily guided you through intersting recommendations.    We were delighted we had booked the HB option many of the guests nervous about eating in outside the hotel chose to dine in most evenings and the cheaper option is definately to book the HB option in advance.    On the subject of booking the hotel book directly with the hotel rather than use a booking website it is far cheaper and they also have a spa package option which is very reasonable.    The hotel is 15 minutes outside Marrakesh and the hotel offered a reliable regular shuttle service to the Medina. We found the location of the hotel superb it proved a luxurious haven from the hussle and hussle of the city.    Try the Hamman massage it is amazing and worth every penny.    We stay for the second time in room 106 it has amazing views towards the Atlas Mountains. The garden rooms are more expensive but a little dark.    The hotel was spoltlessly clean. The hotel staff were amazing nothing was too much trouble from ordering in 0% fat yougarts making up special salads and dealing happily with our every request.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,richard e wrote a review Nov 2015,50,Recent Holiday,I visited this resort recently (8th Nov - 15th Nov 15) with my wife and son. The Hotel was excellent and the staff very attentive at all times. The General Manager (Owner) walked around the hotel each day making sure we were happy and comfortable with the Hotel and services provided a very nice touch we thought. The Manager of the food and beverages was also on hand checking and making sure all was going well. The food was cooked to perfection at both the breakfast buffet and the a la carte evening meal.  The only down side was on a trip to Medina there were 2 men to greet us off of the Courtesy Bus run by the Hotel. The Hotel driver had some sort of association with the men as they shook hands and he introduced them to us They claimed to be working for the Hotel when we questioned them. They were apparently guides and only asked that if we were happy at the end of the tour that we would give them a small tip. If we were not happy then there would be no pressure for a tip as he was paid by the Hotel. No problem we thought until at the end he got very aggressive because we only gave him the equivalent to ¬£5 (a good tip apparently and more than most earn in one day). Feeling quite nervous and apprehensive we gave him ¬£10 which still didn't seem to be enough. Eventually after an embarrassing argument he walked off swearing and making some gestures towards me and my family.  It made no difference to what we all thought was an excellent Hotel and Holiday. I would however advise anyone thinking of this trip to Medina not to fall for this scam.  The flight with Easy Jet both ways was brilliant along with the transfers by A2B.  Great Hotel and Great staff just watch the scam.  Richard,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/529richarde

The place is amazing not just to stay in but to look at too. The staff are the friendliest most helpful people I have ever met and couldn't do enough for you. We had a mini suite with private garden which you could just walk out of and you were at the pool. The rooms are kept spotlessly clean with much attention taken to the guests. We came for an anniversary and found our room covered in rose petals and towels shaped as hearts and swans. We decided to eat in the hotel restaurant that night and the food was 5 star as was the surprise cake they presented us with. They run a shuttle service several times a day for free to the medina square which is a really busy market place but fab to see and experience how the Berbers live. They will also arrange a private taxi service to anywhere for 20 euros. The hotel greeted us with tradition Moroccan tea I thought this was a lovely touch of hospitality. I can't find fault in anything. Breakfast is buffet style with loads of choice it was perfect. There's a spa a gym a shisha and sports bar and the hotel bar is so relaxing and welcoming. If you want a break where you can dip in and out the madness and truly relax in between them I really couldn't recommend this place highly enough.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Harry2837 wrote a review Nov 2015,50,Total relaxation,I‚Äôm not going to give this any less than five stars even though there are some minor issues that could be rectified. The positives are too many.    This is an intimate exclusive secluded resort on the outskirts of Marrakesh that offers nothing less than total relaxation. Don‚Äôt expect to go here to party or stay out late. It‚Äôs all about letting your body recharge for a few blissful days.    The cubist concrete buildings surround two pools the smaller of which is heated. In the main building there is a small gym a spa a pool room (with Bein Sport) a bar and a restaurant. There are less than 30 rooms which means that there are comfortable double sun loungers for each guest. The best rooms have their own small pool.  The top ten things I liked about this place were    1) No music playing round the pool. No hideous ‚ÄúW‚Äù style new age jazz or even worse the ubiquitous hipsterised slowed-down versions of 90‚Äôs classics. All you can hear are the birds twittering and occasionally from far away the call to prayer.  2) Mostly decent prices. A beer for example is about 6 euros.  3) Large stylish rooms with kettles and large comfortable beds  4) Discreet staff who are always polite and helpful  5) Fantastic delicious breakfast buffet  6) Free shuttle into the city  7) Room cleaners leave cookies  8) Spotlessly clean grounds  9) Library to swap books and  10) Big beautiful night skies and hot sunny days. I presume you can pretty much rely on the sun here.    What‚Äôs not to like? Well there are a few things that could be made better. I hesitate to mention them because I don‚Äôt want to detract from the attractiveness of the place but here goes:    1) No conditioner in bathrooms  2) Heated pool could be a couple of degrees warmer  3) Evening meal is pricy  4) Wifi was spotty  5) Policy of not allowing guests to bring own food and drink (we didn‚Äôt know about this until arrival ‚Äì we‚Äôd brought a bit of booze and a few snacks and we didn‚Äôt have any problems) and  6) An outrageous 20 euro charge to drive you to the airport nearby. That‚Äôs about 4x what a normal taxi would cost.    Please don‚Äôt let these comments put you off. I would totally recommend this place to anyone seeking to do absolutely nothing for a few days. Be aware that it is kind of in the middle of nowhere you can‚Äôt just walk off site and go to a local bar or store. Once you‚Äôre here you‚Äôre here ‚Äì unless you take the shuttle into town. Highly recommended to all except the young party crowd.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Sheffield,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harry2837
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Chrisfamily271 wrote a review Nov 2015,50,Brilliant hotel,"Chose this hotel from reviews on tripadvisor and had high expectations. The hotel exceeded them! What we really liked were:  The look of the place - well laid out impressive building but intimate decent pools sense of space enough people but equally private and never competing for a good place to sit in the restaurant or by the pool.  The location - we liked staying out of Marrakesh it gives you more space to relax. Shuttle service into the city is easy and you can step out when you have had enough  The rooms - we were upgraded to garden suites - comfortable relaxing without being full of unnecessary extras. They are well sound proofed so not bothered by noise  The food - good choice from 2 menus - we like our food but over 6 days were never stuck for choices and many of the dishes were delicious  The staff - friendly helpful and quick to look out for your needs. I really liked the way that they were there to sort things out without feeling that they were ""hovering""  The owner's attention to detail. He takes a hands on interest in his guests. For instance he had spotted from our passports that it was our teenagers birthday the day after we left and arranged a small surprise without our knowledge for their last meal - which included the staff singing happy birthday to them in English French and Arabic! Could have made teenagers die with embarrassment but says a lot about the charm of the place and the people that they just laughed and enjoyed it.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Matthew L wrote a review Nov 2015,50,Trip Advisor Reviews are Rarely Wrong,Whenever we book a hotel we look at the Trip Advisor Reviews first. How true the good reviews are. This is a gem of a hotel far enough out of the city for tranquility but close enough when you want to get into the hustle and bustle of the wonderful Marrakech. The hotel covers quite a large area - the pool and green spaces make it feel like an real oasis. We often wondered where all the other guests were. The food is excellent the staff are very helpful and Anas is a man at the very top of his game. Thoroughly professional polite and helpful.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Iver, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/159MatthewL
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,CLAIRESD2018 wrote a review Nov 2015,50,wonderful hotel,we stayed for a week during half term 2 adults and 1 child of 11. We loved our stay total oasis of calm away from the madness of the medina. We upgraded from B&B to HB which was ideal for us. We didn't want the hassle of finding somewhere to eat every night with an 11 year old with us! Food was excellent staff so attentive in every way from the pool staff to the Owner who couldn't do enough to assist you in every way. The pool area is gorgeous sunbeds so comfy! Would I go back ?

We really couldn't fault the hotel in any way. It's a perfect location for nearby excellent golf courses and trips into the Medina....The staff really couldn't have been more helpful and attentive (something that is sometimes lacking in larger hotels sometimes). For me the food was the best we had on our trip better than the much more expensive hotels and restaurants we tried and fantastic value.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,K A wrote a review Oct 2015,50,The most beautiful boutique hotel,I had such a lovely week at Sirayane Boutique Hotel and Spa I felt compelled to write a review.    We stayed in Room 106 (a twin room with a balcony) - the finish was stunning and the bathroom with its polished concrete look and waterfall shower is sublime.    The staff are so attentive and welcoming (special thanks must go to Soufiane Zidane Mohammed Wassim). Nothing is too much trouble and they are willing to assist in anything. The food is spectacular - I particularly recommend the Moroccan dinner dishes.    The pool is fantastic and the pool butler must get a special mention for ensuring the parasol was moved throughout the day.    The hotel's location is great close to the airport and the main road to the Atlas Mountains whilst being a 15 minute ride to Marrakech itself. The hotel's free shuttle is excellent and drops you right in the centre.    The hotel also organised an airport transfer for us with Hakim who is the nicest Moroccan we met on holiday! We wanted to go to Oarzazate for a day trip and Hakim  arranged everything for just ¬£50 pp (which for a 12 hour day trip is pretty amazing!)    The spa is sublime and offers a wide variety of treatments the ladies are exceptionally welcoming and kind and I can particularly recommend the hammam experience.

The location is a 15 minute drive to the medina which suited us perfectly as the area in and around there is complete chaos! Which brings me to their great spa all the treatments we had were spot on even though I had no clue what to expect for my first hamamm! The hotel even provide plug adapters which is a nice touch.

I would highly recommend this to couples or friends who want relaxation and great service. The pools are lovely and the spa is very reasonable.  Food is to a very high standard and we enjoyed everything we tried. A couple of points but very small points to mention was the cocktails were not always as tasty as I have had at other hotels and the service at times in the bar could be a little slower than I would like. I am almost being picky as the hotel was so good.  Overall this was a great little hotel with good amenities good service and good food and good value for money.

There are lots of really thoughtful touches including roses in the room biscuits and fresh water and a selection of dvd's and books you can borrow. The hotel itself is beautifully decorated with a great games room a large pool with double sun beds and grounds you can walk in. There is a also a complimentary bus into town which leaves several times a day. By far and away the best thing about the hotel is the customer service. The staff are so polite and attend to your every need. The manager comes round regularly to check everything is ok and to see if we need anything.

The room was very large with a separate sitting area had tea making facilities (the only hotel that offered this from our trip through Morocco) 2 TVs and a large bathroom. Our private pool was heated and the private garden had the sun all day.    The food was quite expensive but justified as it was outstanding the best we've had in Morocco.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Danielle918 wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Such a nice break from the busy city!,"My husband and I traveled to Morocco for our honeymoon. The beginning of our trip was full of adventure and traveling around to riads the Sahara Desert and Essaouria. We were exhausted and ready for a relaxing ""honeymoon"" atmosphere. This hotel was exactly what we were looking for and I am so glad that I read the reviews and booked here. This hotel is beautiful and the staff was wonderful. Things are much pricier here but that was to be expected. We ate our meals here throughout our stay and all of the food is wonderful.    The only thing I will say is that I feel the spa needs to have guests fill out a form or some sort of information sheet before having spa treatments done. We had a hamman and massage treatment during our stay and if someone had sensitive skin or any sort of skin condition the hamman treatment would have been very painful (there is aggressive exfoliating involved). That would be my advice to the spa. If I ever travel to Morocco again I would definitely stay here.",Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Denver, Colorado",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Danielle918

The hotel has every service you could ask for: great food (breakfast lunch & dinner) swimming pool gym and spa. The staff were also excellent and cater for all your needs they provided gluten free bread and cake every breakfast when I notified them that I was coeliac even though there was plenty I could eat and provided excellent tips on what activities or trips to do. We really liked the dinner in the restaurant and ate there 5/10 nights and felt the food was good value for the quality with large portions.    The room was also fantastic which had a modern decoration and was very spacious with our own private garden facing the swimming pool which was great to chill in the evenings.    All in all the hotel was fantastic and I have not one complaint from out trip. It is a lovely relaxing hotel that is far enough away from the maddness of Marrakech but close enough to visit.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Sarah W wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Tranquil oasis in a busy city,Stayed for 5 nights at the end of August. Upon arrival we were greeted with complimentary mint tea which was delicious. Our room wasn't yet ready but we were able to change clothes in the spa.    The reception area (where we took tea) was stunning and the d√©cor continued throughout the hotel. Everywhere was modern and clean.    When our room (a junior suite with a private garden) was ready we were taken there and shown how to work the air con where the fridge was how to work the safe etc etc. Our cases had already been taken there earlier. The suite was spacious with a separate shower and toilet. There were complimentary toiletries and bath robes for our use.    The pool area was surrounded by around 16 or so (very comfortable!) double sunbeds and it was only seconds after arriving at one that towels were laid down for you. The pool was never busy and we often had it to ourselves.    Breakfast each morning was vast! Absolutely anything and everything you could wish for. The staff (will mention them later) remembered each morning whether you took coffee juice etc and would prepare it as you approached. My partner would have cereal followed meats and cheese and I had a wonderful fruit salad and either toast or Danish pastries and even cake!    Food from both the lunch and dinner menu's was delicious. and plentiful - portions were rather large! Some days I had just the tuna and tomato for lunch which was delicious and certainly enough in the heat. A couple of evenings at dinner I ordered things from the lunch menu and the chef was kind enough to oblige. There are two dinner menu's available a Moroccan menu and a more Western menu with even Shepherd's Pie!    We used the Spa several times. A hammam on the first day - wow! Having never had one I'm not used to be scrubbed so vigorously and having buckets of water tossed over me but the ladies were lovely and our skin was so soft at the end of it. We both had an Oriental massage. Very relaxing with the odd squirm when it came to knots in my shoulders and neck! My partner had a foot massage on the final day a mixture between an Oriental massage and Reflexology focussing on pressure points. He loved it.    We pre booked and made use of the free shuttle a couple of mornings during our time there. We got the 9.30am bus into town and the 1pm one home. It was easier to do our shopping during the cooler and quieter mornings. Transfer time at this time of day was 10-15 mins.    Wifi is available in all areas of the hotel. Sometimes the signal is stronger than others but generally it was very good.    Now the staff......They are the icing on the cake! There are many of them around they are warm engaging and polite and always happy to help. My French is poor and luckily their English is very good so there was no language barrier. Enes the Deputy GM was always around asking how we were if we were happy etc. We met the owner several times and he seemed genuinely interested to hear how we were enjoying our stay. All of the waiters were brilliant Soufaine and Wassim in particular.    We ran up quite a bill during our stay - mainly at the bar! It's worth noting that all transactions at the hotel are subject to a 10% service charge. However we tipped the Spa staff as we went along and also left tips at the end in addition to this.    This was our second visit to Marrakech and very different to our first when we stayed in a Riad. This trip was for pure relaxation and a couple of shopping trips and this is exactly what we did. Due to the location you do need to plan if you wish to pop out and there is nothing else in the vicinity so you can't go for a wander around.    All in all I would definitely recommend this hotel for pure relaxation and having your every need catered for.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Anne H wrote a review Sep 2015,50,A real oasis of calm,I stayed at The Sirayane very recently with my duaghters - we all needed a short break to recharge our batteries and just to relax. Right from the start everything was perfect; we were collected from the airport by a representative from the hotel smiling (even though I think we had kept him waiting awhile). The staff were waiting for us as we arrived and served us mint tea as they outlined what was available to us during our stay. The Hammam spa scrub was fabulous followed by a full body massage left us all completely cleansed and relaxed. Food was varied with an 'international' menu and a 'Moroccan' menu - we chose the Moroccan food and it was great - we ate 'in' for the first two evenings before braving the street food of the Medina. The free shuttle to the Medina worked so well we could pop in and out at pre-set times day and night.  The place is so quiet no night life - but then that's all a couple of miles away. This is pure indulgence a sense of being looked after by staff who cared not in a subservient way ( I was told that English speaking French 'always make me laugh') but it was exactly right given my attempts to speak the language.  I will return because it's so easy the sun the caring staff and the total chill factor.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Julie G wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Viva Sirayane!!!,"It's not taken me too long to write this review. That's often the way when you write from the heart.    Mr G & I stumbled across this little beauty and chose it for a last minute break to recharge. Mr G leans towards luxury hence us being lucky enough to have stayed in some of the best hotels in the world.    Sirayane stands toe to toe in comparison with the big ticket hotel boys by employing a high staff to guest ratio (28 rooms 65 staff (approx)). This strong team work together and seamlessly delivering a consistent friendly bespoke experience to its guests. Customer service is intuitive; not intrusive or by design.    Nothing is too much trouble and always delivered with a smile. Examples include; relocating you (and all gadgets garments lotions and potions) at the pool if you seek shade or sun. Halving lunch portions if you aren't too hungry but can't resist.. ""Gifting"" you with treats ""just because"" and indulging my ordering off menu resulting from my blatant fussiness.    The pool area is a haven. Being the focal point and comprising of two pools (one heated) it is surrounded by carefully tended gardens scattered with low level futon style sun loungers with huge pillows. The sunbeds are accented with vibrant orange coloured pool towels that are provided and replenished as needed. The sunbed covers were replaced during our stay.    The pool butlers are never too far away and work tirelessly to keep guests comfortable in particular re-positioning huge umbrellas to optimise shade where needed.    Rooms provide calm cool privacy within industrial chic interiors softened with tasteful soft furnishings and unobtrusive appropriate art work. Turn down delights with dustings of rose petals the placing of flowers whilst attending to practicalities such as supplying water.    Food is what you want it to be (see earlier). The staff will accommodate your requirements and requests if they can. The lunch menu offers burgers and panini's and salads and quiche. The dinner menu offers international and morrocan fayre the fish was particularly good. Breakfast provides all that you need. A huge variety of fresh juice and incredibly fluffy scrambled egg. Mr G loved the coffee declaring it a good as in Paris.    Welcome additions are the excellent WIFI coverage frequent shuttle service to and from the Medina and the gym (all complementary). The spa offers a wide range of treatments delivered professionally at reasonable prices.    The owner and his management team see the guests daily expressly inviting feedback and checking that all is well.    Now for the science bit; we stayed in a mini suite very comfortable TV DVD artic aircon soft king size bed shower with good pressure and plenty of towels. Dressing gowns toiletries and slippers were all provided. Each suite has a private garden area leading directly to the pool. Lunch costs around ¬£18.00 for two (including water/soft drink). A gin and tonic is around ¬£6.50 (served with lovely olives and nuts) Orange juice ¬£4.00 Coke/sprite ¬£4.00. Cappuccino ¬£2.50 (all approx) Car to the medina ¬£45.00 (return) (shuttle free) The spa has deals available. I had a manicure pedicure and facial approx 3 hours of pampering for around ¬£80.00    The staff are at the heart of Sirayane. They are integral and sharing your experience. They take every step to ensure that your stay is enjoyable. I can't thank them all enough.    Restorative romantic rounded and relaxing.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Carly S wrote a review Sep 2015,40,Nearly perfect,I have just returned from 5 nights here. I work in the travel industry so do find myself sometimes being very criticle however one the whole this was lovely!!    This hotel as the potential to be incredibly tranquil. It is a very small hotel which has been beautifully built and layed out. There were however a few screaming children which was a slight negative. I felt it was a bit mean really as the hotel as nothing to offer children so you couldnt really blame them they were probably bored. If it was adults only it would be FANTASTIC.    I am a fan of pampering and have had treatments all around the world. I can honestly say the spa and the treatments I had were up there in the top 3 I have ever had.    Another point was the food I personally didnt warm to the local food as they tend to put sugar and cinnamon on EVERYTHING. In the hotel the breakfast was fine something for everyone I am sure Lunch menu was also good with a nice variety however I would say the dinner menu could be improved with more choice and also a lot of people like to see an a la carte menu and are not fussed with a set menu every day.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Oliver vl V wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Fantasitc,I see some bad reviews and I just do not get why!!! The hotel was great location is what it is - but then when booking it - you can see that - remote but quiet (exactly what we want). The pool and service top standard and the food was to die for. We enjoyed everything about the hotel from the spa free shuttle and the atmosphere.  The meal we had the night before we left (the best we had a whole stay in Marrakech) and i hope the chef knows it!    The staff were lovely the General manager took so much pride which is wonderful and we had several chats with the owner. (Rare to see hotel owners checking with guests I add). Also free wifi a good plus    Want to go back!!!!    My only tip (provide conditioner to the rooms). A perhaps check the tv reception - did not need it really but some channels were fuzzy (in room 102),Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/olivervlv
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,ReveriesReverie wrote a review Sep 2015,40,Serene and lovely with amazing staff and exceptional management. A true place of relaxation.,Serene and lovely with amazing staff and exceptional management. A true place of relaxation.    There are few things to do here other than focus on whomever you're traveling with or relax by yourself - which I think is brilliant. A place to kick back and enjoy the gentle breeze low unobtrusive music and the hum of nature around you. I didn't really think it was a place for families (unless you have a villa with a private pool) as there is little to do it is a bit far out of town and to be honest on a couple of occasions having kids around the main pool screeching proved a distraction for what were mainly adults (both singles and couples) wanting a quiet time...    Drinks are on the pricey side so be warned (¬£4 plus 10% service for a small bottle of Heineken/ ¬£8 plus 10% service for a cocktail and between ¬£10-40 for a bottle of wine). Food was nice but could become repetitive. Vegetarians might get bored easily as it was predominantly meat and fish on offer. Would definitely benefit from a short-order snack menu enhanced salad menu and a seasonal specials menu; potentially an exploration of Moroccan regional cuisine? However and in fairness; the hotel is so well run that whatever you wanted they would try to accommodate it.    We didn't avail ourselves of any of the day trips available which seemed comprehensive as we wanted a quiet time. However they did start at the ¬£100 GBP mark - which I thought was a little pricey when you factor in 10% service charge and then the obligatory tips after that. However without knowing the full details on those maybe I was missing something that warranted the high price tag - particularly for the 'day around Marrakech' - which I thought could be done by yourself for a lot less...    We did however thoroughly enjoy a visit to the onsite Hamam - which was outstanding. If you've never done it before don't be afraid and jump right in! It is a serene experience and the staff were lovely and extremely professional.    Pool is gorgeous sunbeds are fantastic and the pool staff really attentive. And when you'd had enough of that there's an excellently equipped room with oodles of storage ultra modern TV/DVD beautiful bed lovely bathroom/wetroom and cooling air-con to return to.    All in all a really nice break for a week and I'd certainly consider returning.,Date of stay: August 2015,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ReveriesReverie
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,CautiouslyOptimistic wrote a review Sep 2015,50,An oasis moments from the Medina,Boutique has been thrown around too much lately but this place deserves to use the term. Despite having only 28 rooms the Sirayane manages to provide services to rival many mainstream hotels. A lot of thought has been put into the design of this hotel and it shows.    The pool is the perfect size and surrounded by double bed style sun loungers. The gardens are well maintained with the odd hammock dotted around for you to collapse in as the sun sets.    We booked a Privilege room but were upgraded when we arrived to one of the Mini Suites with private garden sunbeds as well as a huge shower. The rooms are a good size with all the usual amenities (AC TV DVD Player). The bathroom area is open but the toilet is behind a closed door and the shower is hidden away.    The Sirayane's breakfasts are what you get at most hotels. They could do with offering another hot dish or two but the fresh juices and coffee are lovely. We had dinner at the hotel three times twice in the restaurant which offers a pretty good menu with most dishes between ¬£12-¬£16 and once using room service. Although room service is a limited menu they'll happily send over food from the main restaurant menu. The lunch menu is good value and if you're after something slightly different just ask they do their best to accommodate. As vegetarians we were a little worried that we'd struggle having seen the sample menus online but the waiters were happy to run through what dishes they could make as vegetarian or offer lunch time dishes that suited.    Next to the restaurant is the main bar with a nice seating area. Further down the corridor is a library area and then a lounge area at the end with a fireplace for when it cools down in winter. The second bar or Sports Bar offers Shisha and has a pool table. Although called a Sports Bar this little room tends to play music channels. Throughout the rest of the hotel they gently play chilled music that just makes you want to sink into a chair and doze off.    The hotel also has a small but well equipped gym as well as a Spa offering a number of treatments. I had a Tonic Massage whilst I was there which was excellent and the treatment rooms were quiet and calming.    However nothing above can compete with the standard of service offered at the Sirayane. The staff are unbelievably welcoming and friendly. They go out of their way to help make your stay perfect and that includes the food and drinks manager who makes a special effort to check on your stay daily.    There are a couple of minor improvements they could make to ensure this place is perfect. A full length mirror in the rooms would be a nice addition and the hotel is probably due a tidy up in some areas (we had a broken sunbed in our garden but it looks like they're in the process of replacing these). The sun loungers by the pool must be a pain to keep clean but they'd look so much better if they were a little tidier as they are watermarked. The only other negative is that they need to make sure the cleaning is spot on. The glass needs cleaning better on tables and mirrors and it would be good to have the outdoor seating in the rooms brushed to remove sand dust.    The hotel also offers a transfer service for the airport in a large MPV and a fairly regular free shuttle to and from the Medina. You can book excursions directly with the hotel including a day trip to the Atlas Mountains (reviewed separately). We booked this for 4 as we met another couple on the trip but the price is the same for 1-6 people at 1200 MAD. I'd avoid booking through a Rep as another couple did and the trip didn't sound half as good.    It would be very helpful if the hotel offered information leaflets on the excursions they offer details of what you need to know for each and also some printed advice on restaurants to try or the best souks with maps from the drop off point.    I'll definitely be back to see more of Morocco and this place is guaranteed to feature on that trip.,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CautiouslyOptimistic
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Hayley P wrote a review Aug 2015,50,A Perfect Honeymoon,We stayed in one of the Sirayane's Deluxe Suites with pool and garden for 7 nights in the middle of August for our honeymoon. Despite a delayed flight from the UK and with no transfer documents we found the BA representative who was very accommodating and helpful.  Upon arriving at the hotel we were presented with a refreshing and much needed local tea before being given a quick tour and shown to our room. We were not particularly hungry so did not eat dinner on our first night nonetheless a table was reserved for us at the restaurant. The night manager also informed us that room service was included in our half-board option- something we took full advantage of throughout our stay.    For those who like being holed up in your room this hotel is perfect. We ordered breakfast as room service for our first morning which was plentiful to say the least and kept us full well into the afternoon. The breakfast was delivered by the Assistant Manager and Manager of Food and Beverages Enis who also made an effort to speak to all guests at breakfast to check up on our stay. We were told that we could decide between lunch and dinner to fulfil our half-board which enabled us to eat out at the medina if we chose to without feeling like we were wasting our money.    The room was spacious and the photos on their own and this website are very accurate. We had 2 TVs both with DVD players but reception wasn't great. (With it being our honeymoon though we didn't really care!)    The pool was self cleaning and although it wasn't always pumping to remove the bugs the staff were always on hand to fix it. The gardens were well manicured and towels provided when we needed them. We practically lived out in the garden and I the pool. As we had our own we didn't use the main pool but it did not look overly crowded and it was always pretty quiet. There was a mix of guests: couples small groups and families but again it was quiet and the atmosphere calm and relaxing.    Things to consider are:  We didn't track out spending on drinks or lunch as it was a special holiday but you could rack up a large bill if you are on a budget and not documenting how many drinks you have from the minibar or bar.    Medina:  We used a local guide who had some good local knowledge but he wasn't necessary at all. We didn't feel particularly harassed once he left us.    Currency:  We were able to pay using GBP and generally EUROs are accepted everywhere too. We tipped at the hotel on our first day but then left a tip at the restaurant on our last evening and a tip for the maids between the pillows upon departure. We spent a lot only because as I said we weren't tracking.    Overall we can't wait to go back. Even if we don't have a private pool next time I don't doubt that we'll have another amazing stay.,Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/127hayleyp

It was our first time in Morroco so we didn't know what to expect. We turned up by our private transport that had been booked for us and turned up the the most amazing hotel. I travel a lot within work and stay in 4-5 star hotels and this was definitely up there in the top spot!!    We arrived early and was just in time for breakfast. A fine selection of food hot and cold. Selection of teas and juices kept us going all week! Lunch and dinner also amazing with different selection of food.    Rooms were again amazing bed comfortable and the room was clean and tidy.    Staff couldn't do enough for us. Anything we needed the staff had it ready and anticipated our needs. We met the owner every day and he would always ask if we needed anything. We never did as it was all done for us!    We booked the Atlas Mountains through the hotel also which is something I would definitely recommend beautiful views and our tour guide was brilliant. Make sure you wear trainers though as it was more of a trek than a walk but highly recommended.    Pool was clean tidy and always a sun bed as the hotel is a boutique hotel it never felt busy. Some mornings our towel was put down for us! High five to the pool guy?!!

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Jessica M wrote a review Aug 2015,50,Hard to beat!,We travelled as a family of 5. Our three children are 2422 and 16 - boy girl boy. We wanted to explore Marrakech but did not want to stay in the centre of the city in a rihad nor did we want to stay at a large impersonal hotel. The Sirayane ticked the boxes when we made the initial booking and we were hugely delighted to find the actual hotel to be so much better than it appeared on the web-site. Upon arrival we were met at the airport by the a driver organised very reasonably by the Sirayane. The transfer to the hotel took about 20 minutes. Upon arrival at the hotel we were greeted with mint tea and then shown to our lovely pool-side bedrooms. They had allowed for our three offspring to share a room which was great - the only slight problem was that the set-up of the shower room although lovely and contemporary did not allow for the 100% privacy our daughter might have liked. Dinner on our first night was lovely and the breakfast spread was fantastic the following morning. Our first morning was spent relaxing by the pool on the lovely sun-beds and we were spoilt rotten by the pool guy who was so attentive with making sure we had the sun umbrella where we wanted it and lovely orange towels put on our beds each morning immediately outside our rooms. Drinks and snacks could be ordered poolside - the service was really efficient. The lunch in the hotel was good - although it was July and just too hot to eat outside an air-conditioned alternative was supplied immediately. We all had great fun playing a bit of paddle tennis and each evening we took advantage of the free shuttle service to and from town for dinner. Very helpful staff on the front desk assisting with tour guides and restaurant recommendations and reservations. We had a few treatments at the Spa and they were all brilliant. Our youngest son loved the sports bar and managed to cool off by watching the odd football match. Great room cleaning each day and a lovely turn-down service.

Staff are excellent all very kind and helpful they can't do enough for you. The owner introduced himself as we arrived and took time each day to speak to us and check everything was okay as did all the the managers also so I am sure if you had a problem ever it would be sorted immediately. You get the feeling that the staff enjoy working there everyone from the gardeners who do an excellent job to the Pool guy who looks after your every need and the excellent bar & restaurant staff are always smiling and take the time to ensure you have everything you need. Reception staff also very kind and helpful and on hand to recommend places to visit. The room maids and general cleaners in the hotel also do an excellent job as everywhere is spotless. The hotel also provide a FREE shuttle service into centre of town and back several times a day right through till late at night.  The hotel is very well laid out and I think only has 28 rooms and Villas but the gardens and pool areas are so nice you feel almost to have the resort to yourself it is so peaceful.  Would love to visit Marrakech again and would not consider staying anywhere else as the Sirayane could not be bettered in our opinion.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Charlie F wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Relaxing Stay!,My boyfriend and I stayed at Sirayane for 11 nights beginning of July and what a relaxing stay it was! Pool area is just perfect with comfy double beds for sun loungers smiling pool staff and a quiet setting. I saw throughout each day the pool guys were moving peoples sun umbrellas every time the sun moved to ensure they were shaded (those that were in shade) enough which in 45c heat during Ramadan I can imagine is pretty draining to say the least but done with a smile all day! No getting up early to reserve a bed like other hotels there is more than enough to go around! The room itself was lovely with a huge balcony.  The alcohol served in the hotel is really good which is a bonus as that is sometimes missing when holidaying - good quality wines and spirits. The only thing I would say I wasn't overly keen on was the food served at lunch and sometimes evening. The menu itself is okay but my boyfriend and I sometimes found it lacking something however you are in Marrakech with a huge array of restaurants in and around town so its nice to venture out too. Though saying this everyone else that was staying at the hotel couldn't fault the food upon talking to people.  Hotel also run a free shuttle into the medina at various times during the day and evening which proved very useful for dining out and exploring. On our last day the owner even asked the driver to take us all the way to our destination rather than the Medina - at no extra cost! So lovely. Also wifi is really fast and can be used in your room too.  If you are looking for a hotel with nightlife this most definitely isn't the hotel for you no music or entertainment in the evenings but again lots to do in town of an evening.  The staff at this hotel were just the loveliest! Could not do enough for you! Always smiling and making sure all guests were happy. The owner was very friendly and made sure to personally introduce himself to all the guest which is a nice touch.  PERFECT for a short or long stay! Would definitely go back.

We travelled with our son and his girlfriend and were each upgraded to a mini suite with private garden which was like a little bungalow. It was idyllic wandering out from the room through a little garden with outdoor seating and sun loungers to the lovely pool. The pool area has ample parasols and king size outdoor beds which were so comfy with pillows if you wished to sit up and read. The pool staff were the most attentive I have ever come across almost anticipating ones every need. We ate in the restaurant half the nights. This is at one end of the pool which was beautifully lit at night and very romantic. Food was excellent as were the attentive staff who even bothered to learn just how we each liked our coffee. Breakfast was also good - maybe not the vast selections of some larger hotels but ample choices of hot and cold and cake lots of cake! And cheeky birds eager for crumbs - don't leave your food uncovered if you leave the table! We used the spa - for massages and pedicure and manicure - all very good. Although in the middle of nowhere we made full use of the free shuttle service into the centre and back. If you are staying late (and much of the night life there does go on way past midnight - as the temperature is much more comfortable then you will need a taxi back. The major problem in having stayed here is that we are now spoilt. We are currently in a nice 5* in Dubrovnik and I am dreaming of the Sirayane!

The suite had a lounge separated by a little corridor and thick curtain so our toddler slept in there meaning we didn't have to hide in the bathroom at night as we usually do when sharing a hotel room!    The hotel transfer from the airport included a baby seat (not requested by us) which was very thoughtful.    The management made themselves known and were continuously checking everything was okay at mealtimes. If anything they were slightly too attentive but it was amusing rather than annoying.    Considering the restaurant has a fairly captive audience the food was very good. We only had one bad meal during the week we stayed and the rest of the time is was delicious. One lunch menu the same every day and a choice of 2 menus at dinner. There was no kids menu but the staff were happy to cook anything we asked for mainly cheese sandwiches pasta and chips.    Any requests we had were attended to immediately; a lizard found its way into the bathroom and the maid came within a few minutes to get it out for us.    After a particularly windy evening somebody came to clean the private pool before we even had a chance to go out and see how many leaves had flown into it. The pool is approximately 7 metres in length much bigger than a lot of private pools I've come across. There was a big day bed with umbrella in our garden large enough for all 4 of us with pool towels supplied.    I had a spa treatment (hamman) which was very good. It was easy to book just a day in advance and the spa was very clean and had plenty of treatment rooms.    Overall we had a great weeks break. Think 5* Caribbean rather than 5* Asia. From what we could see a lot of the rooms were surrounding the pool so many had access just walking out of their private gardens. Something to consider if you have children but don't want to go for the private pool suite. No need to lug a huge bag of sun cream towels toys goggles books etc to the pool every day.,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,england,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toffee_crisp
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,SMC63_10 wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Wonderful Boutique Hotel,I echo the comments of so many of the reviewers who have commented on the attentive staff and relaxing nature of this hotel. It's true they really do look after you well. The pool side attendants deserve a special mention as they would be attentive to the angle of your umbrella ensuring that it was protecting you from the sun throughout the day. By the way the pool is a great length to get those early morning laps in! What also stood out for me was the oasis that it created for birds as well as people! Each morning we were greeted by incredible bird song and fledglings finding their wings but still demanding to be fed by their mothers! The gardeners at the Sirayane work hard to create a beautiful environment for us to enjoy our relaxation in. This is in stark contrast to the harsh landscape that surrounds the hotel. Those with a room in the main building of the hotel will have an elevated position to view the surrounding landscape where you will see shepherds herding their flocks and packs of feral dogs roaming the landscape. You'll also see any storms that might be brewing as the wind whips up the sand. It's rare to find a hotel that proactively attends to your needs in the way the Sirayane does. The little touches that we experienced from housekeeping to spa to food & beverage to poolside to gardens to private driver/guide to management make this a holiday experience not to be forgotten.,Date of stay: July 2015,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMC63_10

This hotel is perfect for a relaxing break the staff are all friendly the ambiance is relaxing the food excellent and the owner takes time out of his day to ensure that there is nothing further they can assist you with. I have been lucky enough to stay in some of the leading hotels in the world and I can honestly say that the customer service is comparable with the best of them...

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,KPGLHUK wrote a review Jul 2015,50,One week holiday,I stayed here with my boyfriend for one week and it was simply amazing. We arranged a pick up from the airport via the hotel which was excellent value for money. On arrival we had an exceptional check in this included breakfast which was perfect.    We stayed in a room in the main building (101). It was large and of a high standard. The room was cleaned twice a day with fresh towels and Moroccan biscuits.    The pool area is great. The hotel is not very big so it was very private. The sun beds around the pool are so comfortable. The service we received from the pool attendant was outstanding. He set up our bed each day. As it was really hot we used umbrellas as shade. He proactively moved these during the day as the sun moved to ensure we stayed in the shade.    The food in the hotel was delicious. We had lunch there most days and had dinner there 3 times. Every meal was lovely. Wine and cocktail choice both excellent.    The service for all the staff was excellent. They were all super helpful and friendly.    We had a few treatments in the spa which were really good. Staff really attentive. Would recommend the hammam.    The hotel is approximately 15 mins by taxi outside Marrakesh. The free shuttle service was excellent. We loved being slightly outside of the centre as it added a touch of exclusivity to the hotel.    This hotel is highly recommended.,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KPGLHUK
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Tania_101London wrote a review Jul 2015,50,"Fantastic Boutique Hotel, 5 star service",I stayed with my Mum at the Sirayane for 5 days in early July. It was the first time we had visited Morocco and we were after a restful and relaxing break with the ability to explore and make the most of what Marrakech has to offer.    We choose the Sirayane for it's amazing 5 star reviews. It is very rare for everyone to speak so highly of a hotel without some negative comments.    I have been fortunate enough to travel globally with both business and leisure and this is by far one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at.    It is a small independent boutique hotel and spa with 28 rooms. Given the small number of rooms the service is exemplary with a very personal touch. From arrival where you receive a personal guided tour of the hotel to the owner of the hotel introducing himself and checking every is ok each day. It was my Mum's birthday whilst we were there and was lovely touch to give her free cocktails.    The pool is very clean and well maintained. Even officially it closes in the evening they still allow people to swim in it late into the night. The double beds around the pool are extremely comfortable and pool guide on hand to give out the towels. The food is excellent from the varied breakfast and lunch though we didn't have the chance to try dinner.    The hotel is 9km out of Marrakech and runs regular shuttle buses into town every day. We took an early shuttle bus one morning to explore Marrakech and would regularly go in the evening.    We had a number of spa treatments including hammam facial and a deep tissue massage. All of which was to a very high standard and my Mum saying is best massage she has ever had she does suffer from a bad back.    Overall this is an excellent independent small boutique hotel perfect for relaxation and unwinding with everything Marrakech has to offer close by. The service is exemplary I highly recommend and will be coming back.,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tania_101London

Beautiful twin swimming pools with many of the rooms leading directly to them via small private garden areas. Well equipped rooms.  The hotel is not cheap but the half-board meal option is good value. Attentive service. Having breakfast or drinks facing the pools is very attractive.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Sarah Y wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Contemporary hotel offering a stylish retreat from the city of Marrakech,Have just arrived back from a 3 night break with my husband for my 40th Birthday and had an amazing time at the Sirayane Hotel .If you are looking for a ultra-contemporary hotel with an intimate feel and personalised service this is the hotel for you.  The staff are so friendly and provide a personalised service going out of their way to ensure your stay is special.Nothing is too much trouble and they quickly get to know what you like and anticpiate your every need.    We upgraded to a junior suite with a private pool and stayed in room 123I would reccomend upgrading if you want something extra specialthe room was stunning and the private pool in its own secluded garden made the experience.  The day beds around the main pool area are lovely and add a luxury touch when lounging around the pool.    Although 15minutes away from Jemaa el-Fna square and centre of Marrrakech the hotel has a free shuttle bus that opeates throughout the day and night which we used to experience Moroccan life and would then head back to the calm oasis of the hotel.    If you only have a few days like we did then it is worth booking a tour guide and private car to ensure you get to see and experience the highlights of Marrakech.We booked this through the hotel and paid ¬£90 for half a day .    The food at the hotel was excellent and reasonable price-¬£25 for 2 courses.We did book a table at the Jad Mahal Restaurant which was recommended.Great atmosphere with belly dancers and show but food was over priced and very average.(would not go back)  Next door is the Sky Lounge which we went to for pre dinner drinksamazing roof top terrace with 360 view of the city with a cool Ibiza vibe.    The Sirayane is a ultra-contemporary hotel offering a stylish retreat from the city of Marrakech and we cant wait to go back.,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Stamford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahy176
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,worldtravellerplus77 wrote a review Jul 2015,50,You'll cry when you leave...,My partner I and went to Marrakech for a week to switch off and relax.    What a find the Sirayane was!!!    One thing you have to know from the start is that the hotel is 9km out of central Marrakech but the hotel has frequent shuttle services into town.    The welcome and check in was a dream the staff could not have been more helpful and welcoming.  We arrived at 10am and we were immediately invited to have breakfast. Btw the breakfast every morning were lovely.    The pool and sunbeds were just amazing and the pool staff were quickly on hand to provide towels everyday and move the umbrellas to ensure we were in the shade (that is what we wanted in 42 degrees).    Lunch menu was great and again the service seamless with excellent quality food! Staff were great although we were there in the month of Ramadan.    Eating in at night were so much better than eating out in the overly touristy restaurants. The tranquil moonlight reflection on the pool enjoying top quality food with a good selection of wine.    The room was comfortable and was kept clean with a turnover service twice a day.    The hotel was equipped with a gym and tennis court. We had 2 spa treatments in the week and it was very professional and very relaxing.    The owner was very visible and introduced him at the start of the week and checked with us the entire week if we were ok.    If at some point we had concerns we had many opportunities to raise it but it was perfect!    Although being gay in Morocco is illegal my partner and I did not have any public displays of affection in respect of the local law/culture but this establishment made us feel welcome and allow us to have a relaxing time.    I recommend this hotel for a stay when you visit Marrakech.,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Westminster, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worldtravellerplus77
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,tonydare wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Peace and relaxation,When arriving I was struck by the greeness and calm of the place. It really was like arriving in paradise. Straightaway the staff made me comfortable and took me to have breakfast. My room was available from 7am and they let me keep it until I left at 3pm as the hotel wasn't full.  The staff manager and all employees went out of their way to be helpful and friendly and refused tips.  The swimming pool was amazing and clean and almost always empty. There were just 20 or so beds around it and as soon as you sit down a pool attendant appears with a towel.  The food was very good on the whole and sometimes excellent although a little pricey compared to going into town. In Marrakesh itself you are so spoiled for reasonably priced amazing restaurants. There is a free shuttle to and from the hotel at regular intervals.  The room was very spacious and fairly luxurious although under scrutiny one could find the odd little thing to say but I won't.  So to the few downsides. There were a lot of mosquitos and bugs despite the hotels best efforts. They really did go out of the way to treat my room when I told them that I had a bit of a mosquito infestation even with AC on all the time and windows closed. Bugs are only to be expected in the countryside in Africa but bring repellent. I spoke to other guests and they had fewer visitors. Perhaps avoid room 108.  I was also surprised to see that a few families brought young kids to what is an essentially couples/singles hotel. There were several French families that let there kids shout and jump in the pool for hours. What is particularly surprising is living in France myself with a young child the French have zero tolerance to child noice and my son is constantly shushed for speaking loudly.  I also had a few massages in the spa which were nice and relaxing.  All in all a fantastic peaceful break. I would especially recommend it to couples. As a single traveller you do feel like an odd man out.  It is also a perfect base to visit the town and chill when you don't want hustle and bustle.  Lastly there is free Wifi everywhere.,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled solo,France,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonydare
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,sarajanebrown wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Beautiful modern hotel perfect for doing nothing!,If you want a relaxing break with brilliant service amazing spa treatments and quality food this is the perfect hotel. It's quiet (only 28 rooms) which means you aren't overcrowded in the pool at the bar or in the restaurant and the sun beds which are like lying on a double mattress are far enough away from others to give you a bit of privacy. There is also the option of a private garden with some rooms - although we never used it. The food was great because I'm really fussy and was able to order from the lunch menu for dinner (pasta ect) whereas my partner favoured the local dishes and so we were both happy. The bar and restaurant staff can't do enough for you and it was very nice to lie by the pool and order drinks or just sign for everything rather than using money! The rooms are also lovely and always nice and chilled.    I think there are a few minor issues with the hotel - some of the building finishes are a bit poor my room key didn't work on several occasions it's a pain to book at reception for dinner every day especially as the message hadn't got through one day (although they are small so it makes sense to pre book) and it would be great if the lunch menu was also available at night. I was also a bit confused about when lunch ended and dinner started (I think there is a gap between 6 and 8.30). And some of the cleaning in the room wasn't great. The second day I noticed that we had stained sheets. These were tidied and a cover put over to hide the stain but never changed. But overall this is a really really nice hotel that's about 20 mins from the airport and the Medina.,Date of stay: June 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Northampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarajanebrown
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Dickbrick wrote a review Jun 2015,50,Moroccan Magic,We've just returned from a weeks stay with our 19 yr old daughter at the hotel. Although located a 15 minute shuttle bus ride out of the city the hotel provides a tranquil location away from the Medina madness. The small size 30 rooms or thereabouts means that the staff who are all very professional and always welcoming are able to provide a personal touch. The facilities are excellent and the pool area is a very relaxing uncrowned escape from the city. Enes the Hotel catering manager is exemplary in his attention to every deal. Breakfast is rich and varied and the evening meals are of a 5star quality. Simon Zidane our regular waiter made our stay so enjoyable. Nothing was too much trouble and he does the hotel credit. If you are seeking a truly relaxing quality break then you need look no further.

Rooms were upgraded to garden suites which were lovely. Very comfortable and clean. Staff friendly and there seemed to be more of them than guests!  The owner made himself known to all guests and we chatted to him three times during our 5 night stay.  If anyone has complaints about this place then there is no reason why they should add negative comments on here as there are plenty of opportunities to mention any faults to the staff/owner who are so accommodating.  Pool area is great to relax and the sun loungers are very comfortable. Staff at the pool couldn't be more attentive - as soon as you approached a sun lounger he was there with towels and asking if you needed a parasol.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Furry1208 wrote a review Jun 2015,50,Beautiful and relaxing,I came here for 5 nights with my husband in the first week of June. The staff were friendly and attentive and the design of the hotel is beautiful if you like modern design which we do. The service was excellent including the restaurant and the spa where we both had lovely relaxing massages. The food in the restaurant is of very high quality and very well presented; the portions of starters are huge although the food was not always to our taste we wouldnt fault its quality and the service. Please bear in mind that if you plan to have a 3 course meal expect to be at the restaurant for a couple of hours to receive all 3. The main pool looked lovely but we didnt need to use it as we had a suite with our own pool. This was a large suite with great decor and the pool was amazing. Very good value for money considering the same at a hotel here in the UK would probably cost a lot more. The only tiny issue was a few bugs in the bathroom and garden. The garden ones were expected due to the climate and the bathroom ones were attended to by the cleaners swiftly which was great. You get bottles of water in the room everyday and cleaning and turn down service also. The manager was friendly and always asking if we were enjoying ourselves which we were so our encounters with him were only very brief. In the latter half of our stay we did lose our wifi connection for some hours but this was fixed. The breakfast had a wide range of options. The hotel has a quiet and relaxing atmosphere and we really enjoyed this. The shuttle to the square was useful and prompt and we used it a couple of times. We visited a few places during our stay but didn't feel there was a whole lot to see in Marrakech that was of interest to us. If we ever returned it would be for this lovely hotel.,Date of stay: June 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Furry1208
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Henry E wrote a review Jun 2015,50,"Amazing staff, brilliant hotel",We have just returned from a 6 day stay at the Sirayane and had a fantastic time.  The staff really make the experience what it is as many have already stated but we can't stress this enough. Every member of staff was so attentive and made sure every little thing we may have wanted was attended to quickly without making us feel like we were being 'watched'.  On arrival we had our bags taken for us straight from our transfer to our room whilst we sat down to some complimentary mint tea and had everything about the hotel and the area explained to us. This was a lovely touch as it made us feel at ease straight away. We were then taken to our room and had the luxury of being upgraded to a room with a private garden. This turned out to be perfect- the gardens back onto the pool area so we could easily nip on and out during the day and sunbath in the garden if we wished.  We ate at the hotel each evening and the food was really lovely. The wine and cocktails are also delicious!  We made use of the free shuttle on two days and the driver was exactly on time or early on each making our trips to the centre stress-free.  As many have already said the hotel is a real oasis of calm. The souk is inherently busy and therefore somewhat hectic meaning a half day at a time was enough for us before we wanted a relax. The setting of the hotel and the attentiveness of the staff meant we could do exactly that and we ended up staying at the hotel more often than we planned as we just didn't want to leave!  We would definitely recommend the hotel to anyone wanting a relax at a hotel with good food and fantastic staff.  Thank you to all at the Sirayane for giving us a fantastic experience.

On arrival which was about 9pm was shown around the hotel and introduced to staff. Nothing seemed to much trouble for any of the staff. This welcome continued for the whole of our trip.  The hotel is small with no more than 30 rooms which are all spread out across the grounds. This makes you feel special as a guest. The food was excellent on all meals which we had. Be warned lunch dishes are full meals and not snacks which is great but I couldn't finish them as I was fullüòÑ  The hotel is geared up for adults/couples although children are welcome it is designed as a relaxing quite hotel to lie around the great swimming pool and read a book/relax etc.  The free shuttle bus in to the town (which takes 10mins) is great and always turned up when it said it would. You just need to book you times of travel at reception the night before you want to go as sometimes the bus gets busy.  Some of the rooms have private gardens ....I wouldn't bother as they are not completely private. The rooms with private pool are completely shut off and looked great.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Keeley C wrote a review May 2015,50,Cant wait to return!,If you are looking for pure relaxation close to the hustle and bustle of marrakech this hotel is absolutley perfect.    The hotel and its rooms are beautifully designed modern and really well maintained. Although there is a bit of an issue with Bugs but its to be expected in the climate and didnt affect our stay in anyway. The pool is lovely and there is always plenty of room. They also run a regular shuttle into marrakech which is free.    The resturant offers both a european a la carte and a morrocan a la carte and the food is amazing!    However the real selling point for this hotel is the staff. They are incredible and are a real credit to the hotel and its owner Mehdi (who also personally pops by regulary to make sure everything is right with your stay) They are friendly hardworking and cannot do enough for you. We have never recieved better service and would not hesitate to return!

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,JEvans1985 wrote a review May 2015,50,An oasis!,We just returned from 3 nights at the hotel. It was one of the best hotels I have stayed at. It is elegant modern exclusive and chic. Cleanliness is in abundance and the staff are exceptional.    We were upgraded on arrival which was such a treat! The pool area is beautiful and serene- which was a welcome escape from the craziness of marrakech!    The only few issues were a slightly unfriendly member of the reception team (which let down the otherwise excellent reception staff) and if you want to be in the thick of it this place would not be for you. They do however supply an excellent free shuttle bus service to the centre which again is representing excellevt customer care.    Have a spa treatment! Best massage I have ever had and such good value for money!

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,JanineGill wrote a review May 2015,50,"Beautiful, stylish boutique hotel.",My parents recommended this hotel to me as they visited last year and said it was a must! I was not disappointed - in fact I was even more impressed after my visit last week. From the moment I arrived I felt incredibly spoilt and the staff could not do enough for me. Even though I arrived late in the evening I was welcomed and made to feel relaxed and I had everything I needed.    The pool side was beautiful food was delicious staff were so helpful and attentive it was exactly what I was looking for in a relaxing holiday. Even though I was travelling with my cousin and looking for a relaxing holiday there were families who were having a super time too. It would seem that if you are travelling alone or have a family this is the place to go in Marrakech!    The location of the Sirayane is also ideal in 15 minutes you can be at the airport or in the Medina!

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Cchfamily wrote a review May 2015,50,"Wonderful, peaceful retreat!",We have just come back from the Srayane. From the moment we entered through the large imposing doors to reception we knew we had arrived somewhere special. We were checked in sitting on sofas whilst sipping Morrocan tea. Check-in was friendly and quick. We were then given a guided tour around whilst they sorted out our room. We stayed in a junior suite with private pool and we were not disappointed. It was private quiet and spacious. On our first night we ate at the hotel and on first glance the menu looked quiet limited however Annis went through the menu and we chose a few local dishes. The food was amazing so much so we cancelled our dinner plans for the second night to eat again in the restaurant. The owner was always present in the hotel and would wander around chatting to his guests which was a nice touch. We did have a few issues but they were sorted out quickly and to our satisfaction. This really is a couples holiday due to the quietness and location.

Room: perfect (take a garden room). Service: perfect. Kitchen: perfect (make a choice from the Moroccan menu). Spa: perfect.

On arrival we were served the fresh mint tea and seemed so calm staff very hospitable and friendly we were upgraded to a garden suite which was very nice and close to the pool. The manager reguarly comes and says hi and all the staff are very attentive we had bed and breakfast there was plenty of choice from cooked and pastries and if you fancy an omelette you ask they don't offer it. We had dinner which had two menus Moroccan and French both nice and a meal with wine came to about 900 dirhams. There is a free shuttle bus that take you into the main square to visit the soukes it takes 15 mins for anyone booking a dinner there is a 5pm or 730pm shuttle that can take you as well as earlier in the day. The spa was very nice and you also get served mint tea. The drinks around the pool range from 80 dirhams for a cocktail and a gin & Tonic is around 120 dirhams. Around the pool it seemed to be the norm  To pick a sunbed and get the man around the pool to put a towel down for you as there were a lot of towels out and nobody around the pool there were enough beds very comfy and the staff are there from moving the parasol to changing the position of your sunbed. It was a calm of oasis so perfect if you want to visit the souks and to come back to the peace perfect!!

The hotel and the room (mini-suite with private garden - room number 128) exceeded our expectations and the photographs online do not do the hotel justice. The customer service is impeccable. When you meet the owner of the hotel (Mehdi) you soon realise that this impeccable customer service ethos stems from him. He has an unwavering attitude that nothing is too much trouble for his customers. The staff are all friendly knowledgeable and well trained - attentive without being obtrusive - and non-stop without appearing hurried. The breakfast lunch and dinners are of a high standard and thankfully without the pretentious and often meagre offerings from some hotels. The ambience of the hotel is perfect if you are looking for some R&R. Don't worry about it being just outside of Marrakech the hotel has regular free shuttles to and from the centre of Marrakech.

I had the hammam and massage in the spa which was out of this world - worth every penny. The free shuttle to and from town every day made it very easy to dip into the craziness of the Medina and sample what else Marrakech has to offer (several shuttles a day/night).

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,AS3MSC wrote a review Apr 2015,50,Fantastic and luxurious stay in Marrakesh,My wife and I stayed 4 nights back in December we chose the hotel for the private pool villas and great reviews and we were not disappointed. The hotel is secluded and privacy is assured the private pool villas are fantastic and spacious. The hotel has a wonderful decor and charm about it breakfast had a large selection and we ate dinner and lunch here on some days. We also had a complimentary session at the spa which was a fantastic experience. All the staff are extremely polite and helpful and genuinely go out of their way to make you feel accommodated. One of the things my wife and I absolutely loved was the fireplace in the lobby. December in Marrakesh was quite cold and night so we would sit together by the fireplace and order some wonderful Moroccan mint tea.  There is a shuttle bus to and from the city centre which is just a short 15 minute drive away which drops you and collects you outside the jem al fnaa square which was a great help.  Another important mention is the owner Mr Mehdi Bennani Smires is a true gentleman host and businessman. It really meant a lot that he would come everyday and mingle with the guests remembering various points about them and being truly open and approachable if there is a problem he will see to it personally that it is fixed.  Only very minor negative points were that some of the fixtures in the bathroom hadn't been attached with the best quality the toilet roll holder and one of the taps fell off. Also we called reception one day to ask someone to remove the pool cover and noone came after 30mins we called again and still noone came its no issue we did it ourselves but it would have been better if they came immediately. Regardless i want to stress these are very very minor points and i would love to return to Sirayane and receive the hospitality of Mr Bennani Smires and his team again.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Mal L wrote a review Apr 2015,50,An oasis from the hustle and bustle,I stayed for 5 nights at the Sirayane Hotel and Spa with a girlfriend and the service was outstanding.    We were worried at first that perhaps we should have stayed in a Riad in the Medina but our worries were soon put to rest as soon as we pulled up to the hotel. Just 10 minutes away from the walled city the hotel has the benefit of being close to everything yet far enough away to provide peace and tranquility after a busy day in the souks; and the mountain views are quite spectacular!    The hotel design is a modern take on Moroccan structures with luxury finishes beautiful well-tended grounds and luxurious bed-linens. My travel companion a high-end Interior designer was impressed by the surroundings.    The staff are exceptionally willing to please and speak a variety of languages fluently meaning that visitors all across Europe can converse easily with the staff. Bader the hotel Manger was particularly helpful during our stay going out of his way to make recommendations for us booking restaurants and checking in after visits out to make sure we had enjoyed ourselves. Abdul the night concierge was so welcoming and took time out of his own day off to give us a tour of local sights and monuments. You only need move whilst enjoying the sunterrace and the parasol man comes running to tend to your shade needs along with a waiter to see what you need from the bar.    We enjoyed a lovely traditional Moroccan meal in the hotel's restuarant on the first night but after several lunches by the pool the menu does get a little repetetive and boring. As you have no other options nearby it'd be nice to see the lunch menu perhaps expanded or a daily special introduced.    As well as a gorgeous pool beautiful views great staff and location the hotel also has an inhouse dvd library and and book library for you to enjoy. After a busy day pounding the streets of the medina and various tourists sites room service a bottle of wine and a dvd were just what the Dr ordered.    The hotel spa is also worth a visit. We both had the 1hr traditional hamman with black soap treatment which is unlike anything i've ever had in the UK Asia or Europe. Very tactile and relaxing. Do drink lots of water afterwards though!

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,569Sarah wrote a review Apr 2015,50,Peace and tranquility,My husband and I have just returned from a 5 night stay here and we absolutely loved it. We used the hotel transfer service (20 euros each way) which was great. Its about a 15 minute journey from the airport and its well off the beaten track. The welcome was very warm and friendly and after registering we were taken to our room. We had chosen a private garden suite and were very pleased with it. There was plenty of room and all the amenities you would expect. The bed and bathroom had been sprinkled with rose petals a lovely touch and the room was immaculate. There was plenty of storage and a safe excellent aircon mini bar and tea/coffee. Breakfast was included and there was plenty of choice hot continental fresh fruit rolls and cake and omelettes by order. It was lovely to sit outside and enjoy the view of the snow capped Atlas mountains. We had lunch here on 1 occasion we found it delicious and plentiful but mostly we were too full from breakfast to bother with lunch. Dinner is excellent and good value. There is a choice from 2 a la carte menus one Moroccan and one International. We tried both and were really impressed with the quality. At all meal times the service was first class. We found the bar was expensive.  The pool area was also lovely. There are 2 pools side by side the larger one climatised and the other heated. Around the pool were double 'futon' beds with pillows and deep comfy mattresses. There is an attendant on hand all day to help you with umbrellas and towels nothing is too much trouble. We had no trouble getting a bed. The surrounding gardens are immaculate and really beautiful with the mountains as the back drop all you can hear is birdsong. The clientele were mainly adults. We commented that our children would have shattered the peace and thought it would not have suited them for long. This is a total relax and unwind escape from it all kind of place.  You can book trips through reception here we took a day out to the Ourika Valley to see the waterfalls and get closer to the mountains. The trip was really good and the guide was brilliant. We saw a traditional souq (not for the feint hearted) and some stunning scenery. You also get a guided walk/climb up a waterfall. You need trainers for this and to be able bodied as its a pretty tough climb but worth it. Prepare to be hassled to buy trinkets and jewellery at every opportunity!  There was a spa in the hotel but sadly we ran out of time and didn't get to try it.  On departure day we had a very late flight. We were allowed to keep our room for an extra few hours (this is of course dependant on arrivals but the staff bent over backwards trying to accommodate us) and we were later given a room to change and shower in before we left.  The thing that impressed us the most were the staff who genuinely tried their hardest to make our stay as pleasurable as possible and the owner came and chatted to us on a couple of occasions to make sure we were happy and were well looked after. A special mention for Rashid who was a brilliant help!

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Erin_leigh79 wrote a review Apr 2015,30,"Great first 3 days, Bad Last Day",My husband and I stayed at Sirayane for the 3 nights of our honeymoon spent in Marrakesh in Sept 2013. This review is far delayed of course. Overall I really enjoyed this resort. Yes it‚Äôs a 20 minute ride to the center of Marrakesh but the shuttle is convenient enough if you can plan ahead knowing the schedule. We didn‚Äôt take any cabs except to and from the train station to/from Tangier on the Marrakesh Express (see my review!). You are way out of town along some very rural dessert areas with farmers goats shanty houses camp fires at night and lots of dogs/cats running about. So if you are looking for a dessert oasis I‚Äôm afraid this is not it. The hotel and grounds themselves are a bit of an oasis but it‚Äôs all man-made of course. The grounds are beautiful large and very well kept and guarded at night by security (never once felt unsafe though and we walked the grounds at night). When we checked in the first morning arriving from the overnight train from Tangier we had to wait a while for our room to be ready which was fair enough since it was still breakfast time. We were SO tired from not sleeping due to the train travel not being quite so ahem elegant or peaceful. But we were allowed to relax in the breakfast area eat and sip coffee/tea until our room was readied. I don‚Äôt know if I requested an early check in but I seem to recall the person in the room before had just left so I don‚Äôt think it would have helped anyway - understandible. Our stay from that point until the end was very pleasant. We had a room in the main building on the left side that overlooked the pool and some of the dessert. It was nice and quiet very comfortable and spacious. They put rose petals throughout the room which is cute if you like that kind of thing (we don‚Äôt care either way). This was a standard room with no upgrades that I was aware of so if you want the private pool rooms I‚Äôm sure those are more money but we were content. Breakfast each day was of high quality and assortment and it did change a bit here and there but the primary staples remained the same. It was always clean and well organized. We did try the restaurants a few times and they were okay. What I did like about the place was that you could order a bottle of wine at the pool and they would keep it for you if you didn‚Äôt finish it. The pool was always pretty busy but not annoyingly so and they never seemed to run out of chairs. The pool staff were quite good about bringing towels moving lounges and adjusting umbrellas. Most of the guests were Brits or French it seemed. We were one of the few American couples. The bar staff were always nice. Prices for wine were reasonable and along the lines of an American resort but I‚Äôm sure pricy compared to a similar resort in Mexico. Whatever we‚Äôre on honeymoon so drink up!    The real downside was the last day at the resort and this really put a bad taste in my mouth. We did not have to leave until we caught the night train back to Tangier so we had the entire day and planned to visit the Souk for some shopping. It was either that morning or the night before the front desk phoned our room and confirmed our plans for check out. I assumed we‚Äôd have to pack our things to leave at the desk before heading into Marrakesh since I knew we‚Äôd not return before check out. But the person who had called (and I wish to GOD I‚Äôd remembered their name) said not to worry about it that we could take our time and pack up when we got back from shopping that afternoon (I think they needed the room by 3pm or something). We could spend our day as usual shop return shower and then pack up the check out. Perfect! And I thought how nice of them especially since I didn‚Äôt even request this. But it fit the territory of this place being quite accommodating and ‚Äúluxurious‚Äù so I didn‚Äôt think twice about it. So we get to the souk do our shopping around and I think I may have even gotten a phone call or two from the desk but because my phone wasn‚Äôt working great being out home base I couldn‚Äôt check my voicemail. So when we got back to the resort the front desk stopped us to ask why we had not packed our things seeing as how it was well past check out. They proceeded to tell us that the next guest was waiting to get in so they started to pack our stuff for us. Now I‚Äôve worked in a hotel in my past and I know this situation of having to pack up a guests belongings when they Just. Won‚Äôt. Leave. But this wasn‚Äôt the case and all arrangements had been made for our schedule that day. If they had a guest coming into the room why would they allow us to stay late? I explained the situation about the call from the desk and they looked at me like I had two heads. So now we were pre-train travel wanted to change from what we were wearing (read: sweating through) while running around at the Souk and shower before the journey back. They told us to go get our luggage (which I think was sitting outside the room door at this point all packed like we‚Äôd worn out our welcome) and come back down where we could spend the rest of the day in the lobby hanging around like two losers. They did inform us that we could shower in the spa which was fine but it just wasn‚Äôt part of the plan. So here we are in the lounge/library area with our bags wide open trying to repack find our toiletries to bathe with and regroup. It just wasn‚Äôt a cute scene. The main dude at the front desk at this time was just very unforgiving about the whole situation. He really made me feel stupid. Was it a prank call from someone outside the hotel to make us leave our luggage in the room all day so they could break in? Was it someone from the staff who was confused about the check-ins that day? Like I said I‚Äôve worked in customer service my whole life with about 2 years of hotel experience so I know what it takes to make the guest feel appreciated. Even if I was in the wrong he could have handled it better. It was just a bit of a hurried frantic disappointing day to say the least. I know the level of customer service in other countries just isn‚Äôt what it is in the US but there is still a level of decency that should be understood in a place like this no matter the location. Anyway we sat around the resort for a few more hours before getting a cab to the train station area that evening. It felt like we‚Äôd been voted off the island. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll go back just based on the way we were thrown out of the place with little to no second thought.,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Erin_leigh79,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Erin_leigh79
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Nads320 wrote a review Apr 2015,50,"Fantastic, relaxing, stay","We have just returned from a short stay in this excellent hotel and this is first time I have ever rated a hotel 5 out of 5.The reviews are all very positive but still the Sirayane exceeded our expectations. Stunning architecture excellent customer service well prepared and presented food ‚Ä¶..this is really is the place for relaxation and thats exactly what we needed.  We were given a free upgrade to a mini suite with direct access to the pool which was a very nice touch. Both the manager and food and beverage manager took the time to say hello and introduce themselves an excellent example of caring about their clientelle.    There is nothing nearby the hotel but we were aware of this and this suited up as we wanted a ""do nothing "" kind of break. The free shuttle provided by the hotel is comfortable and reliable and runs 6 times a day so there is ample opportunity for a change of scenery.    Breakfast was plentiful and the coffee was great again the service was very attentive. The lunch menu was served until 6.30pm and room service could be ordered from this menu until 11pm. So we really could eat when convenient to us and plan so that we either ate in town or at the hotel.    We enjoyed a Hammam at the spa which was also nice  though there is a misprint on the spa menu which when explained was a little lost in translation so we ended up choosing incorrectly. This was no big deal and a discount for the misunderstanding was applied against our bill.    I genuinely loved this hotel and would be happy to come back this really does offer value for money when you take into consideration the surroundings and luxurious experience available.",Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Orpington, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nads320
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Keira B wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Quiet but lovely,This is a great hotel to unwind and relax. My boyfriend and I stayed for 6 nights and had a really lovely break. We were given room 112 which had its own garden and was right by the pool perfect location. The hotel and grounds are well maintained and there is really nothing I could fault. All your food and drink is charged to your room while you stay and you settle the bill before you leave. This is a good idea in my opinion as there was no need to carry cash around the hotel.    We are in our 20s and I would say this hotel is suited to elder couples. There is no evening entertainment and the hotel is totally secluded not even a shop nearby. The hotel is purely there for relaxation. There were always enough sun beds and a very helpful pool attended providing free towels and umbrellas. The pool is a great size and there is also a smaller heated pool.    If the quiet life is not for you then there is a free shuttle from the hotel into the hustle and bustle of Marrakech which only takes 15 minutes and was never late picking us up. Try and get your hands on a map as it can be daunting the first time and you don‚Äôt want to miss anything.    The breakfast is fine. There was enough to accommodate a fussy eater like me including fresh juices and omelettes cooked to order. The staff are lovely and always ready to assist. My boyfriend loves football and they all made an effort with him making sure there were English games on in the sports bar.    The room suite was a great size with a king size bed mini bar and wet room. The maid leaves lovely designs including flowers cut from the gardens. There is also a turn down service about 8pm. The room has a kettle with coffee and tea and biscuits are provided daily. There is a hairdryer in the bathroom which was strong enough to dry my thick Irish hair. The power supply also worked my GHDs with no problem. The plug you need is the round two pin not the flat two pin.    A special thanks to Aimad on reception. This man is so helpful and always smiling. Any issue or help you need this man will sort for you. The hotel owner is also floating around the hotel and making effort with guests so if you had any problems he would be the man to speak to.    All in all this is a great but quiet hotel. You will come home feeling happy and relaxed. I just hope the weather is better for you than it was for us!,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/423keirab
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Mike011 wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Great food and great service,Just returned home after a week's stay at the Sirayane. Nothing new to add from what has already been said. The dinners were terrific the service as good as it gets and the rooms tick all the boxes especially if you can get a mini suite or better by the pool. A special thank you to the pool attendant who looked after us by switching the towels and pillows when we were at lunch to keep us facing the sun!    I would also recommend the spa complex for a good massage!!    I would only hesitate in recommending this hotel to someone who wants to be next to shops and other activities. Although there is a free shuttle bus which goes into Marrakech 6 times a day the hotel is very cut off from everything. This however adds to the peace and tranquility.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,CMcAdam22 wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Absolutely fantastic- a must in Marrakech!,Before booking our trip to Marrkech I did extensive research on where to stay and the previous reviews of the Hotel Sirayane lead me to choose the hotel for our holiday. I'm so glad we stayed there as it was absolutely fantastic and I'm usually hard to please with high expectations.  I cannot fault the hotel at all the staff were very friendly and so helpful- always looking to go that extra mile for the hotel guests. The room was gorgeous the hotel actually upgraded us for free to a deluxe room with a balcony which was lovely. Nice and clean with top notch facilities and we were able to drink the water from the tap which is a nice rarity in Arab countries. The maid came twice a day and left lovely little touches like rose petals on our pillows.  The hotel facilities were great games room where you can watch sports play pool have a couple of drinks and do shisha. Library with books and a computer. Two pools (one heated one normal) with comfy sunbeds around the outside and fresh beach towels that the hotel provide. Wifi which I have to admit wasn't the best signal but it was okay for what we needed it for.  The food in the restaurant was lovely and always fresh for breakfast. The dinner menu offered traditional Morrocan and English choices so you could get a variety for different preferences although I do recommend trying the traditional Moroccan food particularly the pastillas as they are really unique and a must whilst in Morocco.  On the first day the owner came over to introduce himself to us which I thought was a really nice touch. He said if we needed anything to just let him know and he stuck to his word coming over to say hi again on our second to last day.  The spa facilities were also great and the Hammam experience is also a must whilst in Morocco. Although there was a slight language barrier with the girls that worked there they were friendly and pleasant and good at their jobs.  The hotel offered a free shuttle service into and back from the centre of Marrakech at 5 or 6 different times throughout the day which is really useful and saved us a lot of money. The shuttle usually drops guests at the square but the driver was more than happy to drop us at other points (like Comptoir Darna restaurant which is another must) when we asked him.  We were wary of booking trips with the hotel as we didn't want to spend over the odds but I would definitely recommend doing so as they organised reputable guides and taxi drivers to look after us which is important in Marrakech. I would definitely recommend using a guide for the Souks the first time- its scary and confusing without one!  Although the hotel is a little bit away from Marrakech (15 minute drive) its worth it and is a nice refreshing break from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech. I wanted to share my glowing review so others book here as I know I appreciate the feedback- you won't regret it!,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CMcAdam22

What can I say it met every expectations we imagined and more. The staff could not do enough for us and the food is out of this world. The owner personally came to look for us daily to ensure we were being looked after and to enquire if we needed anything. We have been to many hotels in the world but this hotel beats them all. I am the worlds worse critic when it comes to food and cleanliness and had no worries whatsoever. The owner should be proud of his hotel and staff and we definitely will return and recommend this hotel. My only compliant is that we didn't stay longer. Well done guys and thank you.

I enjoyed a fab spa treatment on arrival and made use of the facilities by having a manicure etc as the week went buy.  We ate breakfast and lunch at the hotel which was lovely and had a few evening meals which were great but we also enjoyed the mini bus service into the city and spent several evenings there exploring.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Cmottley10 wrote a review Mar 2015,40,Style without attitude,Just returned from a seven night stay here we had a wonderful time yes its not five star western standards but then your not paying 5 star western prices! The hotel is in a quiet spot and when we arrived we were upgraded to a room with an outside terrace which was nice to sit on in the afternoon. Breakfast was lovely with lots of choice and the staff were very helpful and attentive. We ate the first night in the restaurant we booked for 8pm and sat there for an hour until we had to nudge the waiter to say where is our food very apologetic they had forgotten about us the starters quickly arrived after that followed by the main course. We decided to give them another try at night and the 2nd time was totally different the service was excellent and the quality of food was super.    The Hotel offer a great shuttle bus service which was always on time and ran frequently only 15 mins to the centre so you have the quiet resort and when you want the hustle and bustle of Marrakech its on your doorstep. We also arranged a trip to the Atlas Mountains through the hotel which was wonderful they supplies a luxury 4 x 4 vehicle and an excellent guide well worth booking if you visit. I would defiantly visit again.    We visited the SPA which to be honest was a bit of a let down the polish which I was expecting to see just was not there which was a shame no lit candles no mint tea just lacked the luxury which it needs at 1200 dhms for two.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Alistair P wrote a review Mar 2015,50,"A relaxing, peaceful and totally enjoyable stay","My wife and I have just returned from a wonderful stay. Sirayane is a short trip from the airport. If you want to have a peaceful location within a short distance of the hustle and bustle of Marrakech you will struggle to find better. Even before we arrived I had asked the hotel a couple of questions they replied quickly and were always very efficient. The service is excellent. Breakfast is very good indeed. The staff were always there! Simple things can make all the difference always keen to please. We had a room with private pool. Yes it was worth it and with hotel being so spacious there was plenty of quiet space if that is what you want. From what I saw I think all rooms have their own merits. There are plenty of ""beds"" around the pool and the pool staff were great. As the sun moved round they would help you change to different beds rearrange towels and pillows how cool is that (although I felt totally lazy!). We had a spa treatment on the night we arrived a good scrub leaving you totally relaxed and skin ready for the tan!! Staff so friendly and would recommend you start with the spa upon arrival! The gym was good free weights and four cardio machines. My wife did fall ill on final night. It happens. The management and staff could not have been more helpful in taking care of her - always a good sign of a great hotel how things are dealt with when those mishaps happen. The free shuttle into Marrakech is spot on. Just let staff know 2 hours before you need to go. Take a trip in at day first then go at night. The 7.30pm returning at 11.15pm works best gives you more time to explore and some restaurants in Marrakech service is a touch slow so you'll not be rushed. Bottom line is when we return to Marrakech we know we will check Sirayane first.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,julesie71 wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Fantastic few days away,We were picked up from the airport by a taxi organised by the hotel. Our flight was delayed but the taxi driver was where we were told he would be.    Taken straight to the hotel. On arrival we were met by the owner of the hotel our suitcases were taken straight to our room whilst we enjoyed a cup of hot mint tea.    Our room was made up extremely nicely considering we were there to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary and my husband's birthday. The bed was decorated with rose petals in the shape of a heart which was a lovely touch. The actual bed was a queen sized bed with a firm mattress. The pillows were nice and soft and we had control of the temperature of the room. The bathroom was lovely with a massive walk in shower. In the morning we noticed that there was not any hot water in the shower when this was mentioned to reception it was reported back to us after an hour and a half that the fault had been rectified. We went and checked it and true to their word it was rectified.    Any time we contacted reception for extra coffee or tea etc. this was delivered to the room within minutes. I have never stayed at any hotel that gave this kind of service before.    The staff at the hotel were magnificient. Very attentive but not overbearing. They would pay attention to us and just a glance would be enough for them to come over and fulfil our needs. All staff were extremely polite and helpful and couldn't do enough for us. We were made to feel like celebrities but duly note that this service was given to all guests.    We don't know if the hotel was full or not but it never felt cramped or empty the balance was lovely.    The food was superb with a great choice of menu both Moroccan and International and very well priced. I requested a surprise birthday cake for my husband and this was catered for with all dining staff singing happy birthday to him!! The cake was delicious and even had his name on it.    The beds around the pool were extremely comfortable and the staff were there to get your towels and put them on the bed you chose.    All in all a fantastic hotel staff and experience and would definately stay again. The weather was also lovely. They even organised two excursions for us which was great.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sutton St Nicholas, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julesie71
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Sue E wrote a review Mar 2015,50,"Excellent service, great atmosphere and superb food.",We have just return from a five day break in this lovely hotel (room 101). The hotel is perfectly situated for convenient access to both the airport and the Medina which are only 15 minutes away using the hotel's taxi service. The hotel is beautifully designed and situated in a quiet but mostly deserted area. If you like to walk out in the evening then this is not the place for you. However the hotel provides a free shuttle bus into the Medina several times a day so you can come and go with ease. If you want calm peace and quiet and excellent service then this should most definitely go on your bucket list. The staff were incredibly well trained polite and efficient and without exception everyone wanted to do what they could to make our stay perfect. The food was the best I have had in a restaurant or hotel for a very long time; there was plenty of choice covering for all tastes and the breakfast was excellent. The wine list consists of only Moroccan wines which were as good as any French wines I enjoy on a regular basis. Our room was very spacious and comfortable and had a view of the Atlas Mountains. If there were any complaints they would be that the shower heads in the bathroom could do with a good descale and the constant visitation at the meal table of the Maitre d' and the Manager to check things were ok was a little overdone. However these are minor details and the latter detail was done with the best possible motive: the staff really care. When my husband lost his wedding ring the staff turned the hotel upside to find it ... and they did!

The cool grey polished concrete of the hotel walls combined with the d√©cor  the spacious and immaculate rooms and lovely communal and pool area provided a perfect balance to the frenetic pulse of Marrakech.

Apart from the basic ones the rooms are typically three in a bungalow each one with a walled garden and view of the pool. The poolside beds are very comfortable. Quite frequently there is background music playing which at times can be irritating. I am sure that the staff would have switched it off if we had asked but we didn't.

The hotel is very quiet which I found ok but my son and his friend wanted more to do at night.  There is a free shuttle bus which is very reliable.  For me it's been an extremely relaxed few days I can't stand noise so this was perfect.

There is a nice tennis court and a small but perfectly adequate fitness room. The only thing that could be improved is the timing of the shuttles - one going to marrakech at 1pm would be great as would one leaving marrakech around 8.30pm.

Being in desperate need for some decent weather in a great location after what seems to have been a long cold wet winter  we simply didn't want to take any chances. People often quote the 5 star element of the hotel and allude to being sometimes underwhelmed. Our view is that the service is excellent  the hotel has tons of charm  the food ( we ate there 5 times in a week ) of a decent quality with some dishes in particular being very good I'm not a salad person however the tuna nicoise was the best salad I've ever had..  Our children aged 8 10 and 15 were perfectly happy. Even they managed to relax and enjoy the calmness ( and heated pool) at the foot of the Atlas Mountains.  We felt the quality compared with the cost was excellent. At the time we stayed all the rooms were full i think there's 28 10 of those rooms were booked by repeat guests which says it all. Being our second visit we found the Medinah and Souks easier going in fact I'm sure I saw a tear in the eye of the vendor as I left with a 'bargain' fab momento lampshade.  The Medinah is intense and personally I would recommend families stay out of the centre to escape and go back to the centre when you fancy some Moroccan Madness. The shuttle provided was perfect. Should you want to experience a Riad Dining Experience Pepe Nero is by far the best. Lastly the owner of the Sirayane is clearly very passionate about his hotel and leads by example. Expect to be made welcome and also engaged in discussion as he and his staff are keen to please. I note some reviewers find this off putting not at all it is just a great example of someone passionate to provide something special for travellers. We like him and his team. We had no cause to complain and as we finished our final meal he made a gesture of not charging us for a table full of superb chocolate fondant.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Andrew K wrote a review Feb 2015,40,"Brutalist gem, with a few minor flaws",If you like brutalist architecture you'll love the Siryane. It's beautifully designed although the execution is not so great in places (it's a valid criticism of brutalism that concrete is unforgiving and does not age gracefully). Going by a 2 year old article which says the hotel is 3 years old I work out that it's 5 years old. Unfortunately even in that short period of time there is evidence of cracks which have been fixed and some issues with the services (of which more later).    We were offered the 30 Euro transfer from the airport (for a family of 4). It's not a long trip (20 minutes maybe) and worth it. They use a perfectly serviceable Hyundai minibus which is clean and comfortable but maybe not what you'd expect from a 5 star hotel. (The last hotel we spent any time in was the Four Seasons in Sharm: the trouble is the Four Seasons does recalibrate what you expect from a five star hotel).    We were offered delicious mint tea while the paperwork was processed and then popped off to dinner.    We had two garden-view mini suites. (117 and 120). The rooms are spacious but have no bathtubs. To cut a long story short 117 had problems with the shower drainage and the heating wasn't working properly. With an outside temperature of only 4C at night this was an issue and we were freezing. I suspect that there was a longstanding problem with the heat pumps originally fitted: the one in 120 had been replaced with a more traditional mini-split unit which worked fine.    I also noticed that in 120 the lip of the shower base had been raised by the additional of another flooring slab as a fix for the draining problem.    The rooms were very clean and comfortable and when we asked for an additional duvet it was delivered very quickly.    The staff were friendly and polite and it was just unfortunately that the weather was cold and drizzly for the first few days. Brutalism doesn't pair well with dodgy weather: although it was a reasonably assumption of the architects that they wouldn't have to encounter it too often in Marrakech.    We'd asked if there were any upgrades available and on our third night we were upgraded (at extra cost) from 117 to 118 next door. It was a lovely room more like a proper suite with a little private pool (heated!) and also had a bathtub. The weather had improved a bit so we did manage to splash about in the pool a bit. The final night saw a further upgrade (paid) to the luxury of 122: a much larger suite with a private garden and private pool (and bigger tellies). The lounge area also featured the sort of glass-and-chrome bar you imagine an aspiring Vladimir Putin might be tempted to lean on. The facilities in 118 and 122 all worked fine.    We were much happier towards the end of the stay - this was due to a combination of the weather improving slightly as well as the room upgrades (although the upgrades themselves were not as important as the fact that the two larger suites actually had functioning heating).    To the credit of the staff when we called about the heating in 117 they sent a maintenance guy and manager over straight away and they were beavering away trying to fix it between about 9:30 pm and midnight (to no avail). Although they did bring a 2kW electric radiator to keep us warm.    The breakfasts were very pleasant although the selection was a little limited (this is a fairly small hotel). The juices were lovely.    We had lunch once - it features a slightly more international menu (hamburger club sandwiches) and dinner on three evenings. Dinner is great - the Moroccan dishes are very tasty and one evening I had a very pleasant steak frites. Room service is also good: the panini with viande hache turn out (not surprisingly) to be essentially mini hamburgers (and very tasty they are too).    Prices are pretty reasonable for a boutique hotel. Minibar prices are 20MAD +10% for cans of coke etc 5MAD +10 % for a local beer. The local Moroccan house red is very tasty. The cocktails in the cocktail bar are really good.    So: this review is very much tainted by the weather. It would have been a lot more positive if we'd had some reasonably spring-like sunshine. That's not the hotel's fault but something to bear in mind.    There's a lot of leeway in the designation 5 stars. This isn't up to the standard of a Four Seasons or the Qasr Al Sarab in Abu Dhabi or the Chedi in Oman but then again it's a lot less expensive than they are. For the price it was pretty good value the staff were great the food tasty and the rooms clean and (once up to temperature) comfortable. If the sun had been shining I bet this would have been a more positive review.,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Oxford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andrew034

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Susan H wrote a review Feb 2015,50,Relaxing Retreat,I have always wanted to go to Marrakech and decided to do so for my 50th birthday. After some careful research I decided on the Sirayane for a relaxing experience (I had considered a riad but wanted some time out from the hustle and bustle of the city). We were not disappointed; this is a great hotel with friendly welcoming staff. We tried a hammam and massage which was fantastic and great value for money. We also partook of the heated swimming pool and although staying mid February we had some wonderful warm days to just chill out by the pool. The food was also excellent and we particularly enjoyed the Moroccan pancakes at breakfast chicken tagine with lemon at lunch and the Moroccan mixed starters for dinner. We travelled into Marrakech several times and also into the Atlas Mountains for a day (great views of the Atlas mountains from our balcony - on a clear day!) so this hotel was the perfect retreat afterwards. Highly recommended.,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/894susanh
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Steelysurrey wrote a review Feb 2015,40,Tranquility,The Sirayane hotel is a welcome relief after a day in the souks and the bustle of Marrakech. The hotel runs a shuttle service to the centre which is a great help as the hotel is about a ten minute journey away. The breakfast is more than adequate with both hot and cold food on offer. The orange juice is to die for. I had a head and shoulder massage whilst there and it was so relaxing. For me the highlight of this hotel was the staff. All of the staff were helpful attentive and couldn't do enough to ensure you had everything you required. The owner was in evidence on more than one occasion and was also keen to know that all was well.

This is a very peaceful modern hotel with stone walls and floors and has a coolness about it fab decor and thought through luxurious furnishings.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Tattyt wrote a review Jan 2015,30,Not a luxury 5* hotel....,We stayed in 4 different hotels in Marrakech and this one was by far the most disappointing. It has great reviews so we were expecting a lovely few days but quickly realised we had made a mistake booking this hotel. The best feature of this hotel would be the staff who are truly very helpful.    Unfortunately the hotel owner is a bit overbearing and when we checked out early the reception staff really did look very worried & one member of staff even followed my partner to the bathroom to ask why we were leaving early. We had decided on not explaining our early check out after reading the owners comments to other unhappy guests and we did not want a hostile argument. In fact the funniest part was when the worried reception staff asked for our email addresses by saying they would try to get a refund from the booking agent for us realistically they just wanted to watch out for our tripadvisor reviews so the owner can bitterly dispute our views. The trouble is the cancellation policy is set out by the hotel so we had no chance of any refund anyhow. Luckily my booking agent (hotels.com) gave me a ¬£100 refund coupon as we are a valued customer of theirs and they trusted my account of the hotel/photos to be a true reflection of our experience.    I understand some people may like this hotel I liked the architecture and the overall concept but the details and quality finish were very much absent. This was the first hotel I have ever been in where you are made to tour the spa facilities before you are allowed to check into your room. Just for the records people dont like the hard sell.    The breakfast buffet was very average but once again the serving staff made it acceptable.    Lunch was of average quality and more expensive than we expected.    The beds around the pool are stained and look dirty and when we arrived they looked buried in long grass. The hotel should really invest in some fitted sheets which can be removed daily and laundered for an overall better effect. The pool seemed nice.    Our patio door was broken and true to his word the manager did get it fixed asap. Very kindly we were upgraded after the first night but unfortunately we just werent happy with the quality of the hotel and didnt want to spoil our honeymoon.    I think my photos show an insight into some of the things we experienced.    We moved to the La Maison Arabe for the same nightly rate after checking out early. It was far superior to the Sirayane in every way.,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"East Coker, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tattyt

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,ollie12375 wrote a review Jan 2015,50,Excellent Stay - thank you!,"We really enjoyed our stay at Sirayane and would recommend it to anyone looking for a low-key but high-class place to stay near Marrakech.    Positives:    * Beautifully designed and maintained hotel and grounds - just looked stunning and while it felt ""modern"" it was quite different to other places we had stayed and somehow distinctively Moroccan    * Large private beautifully appointed and comfortable room (we had a ""mini-suite"" in the grounds with a small enclosed courtyard/garden area)    * Excellent service both on the visible elements (in the bar & restaurant pool-side drinks etc.) and also the 'invisible' elements (our room was meticulously cleaned and turned down morning and night without ever disturbing us)    * Positive friendly attitude from the staff - always willing to help and accommodate their guests to make for a really relaxing stay: even the junior or trainee staff who were still learning some of the ropes were always happy to help where they could (management are to be commended for giving junior staff opportunities to train themselves up and clearly sharing the friendly service approach with them from the outset)    * Excellent food in the evening restaurant - both Morrocan-inspired and French/traditional menus at very reasonable prices. Every dish we tried was novel and really very well executed. Same goes for the 100% Moroccan wine selection - all of good quality and a real discovery for me! The selection and quality of the lighter lunchtime/all-day meals was also excellent and made for some very pleasant lazy lunches on the sunny terrace.    * Ease of access to Marrakech - regular free shuttle service. It was also very easy to arrange guides restaurant recommendations etc. through reception.    * Relaxed atmosphere - this is not a very big hotel and while the amenities (swimming pool spa paddle court pool) are excellent they are not really designed to provide a full programme of ""activity"" - but as a result the atmosphere around the hotel even amongst the guests is very much focused on quiet relaxation: we lay by the pool we read we watched DVDs from our terrace....we felt so relaxed after just a day or two here I would definitely come back for a short break to get some rest!    Things to be aware of....Not really negatives as such because I really find it difficult to fault the hotel - but to be aware of:    * It's out of town - even though there is a regular free shuttle service this is not the place for you if you want to be ""in"" Marrakech: there is also not really much to do immediately outside the hotel - so you have to be happy to either relax at the hotel or take the trip into town (or a day trip elsewhere)    * It's peaceful - if you want to have lots to do all day this place may not work for you...yes there is a spa pool table swimming pool paddle court etc. - but really this is a place to come and relax quietly    * Evening meals - the evening restaurant was excellent (really truly excellent) but for a longer stay it is worth noting that the only alternative to the ""formal"" restaurant is the fairly limited room service offering - this is of perfectly good quality and very enjoyable for a couple of evenings but perhaps the option of a more 'informal' meal offering in the evenings would be welcome - essentially if you were here much longer than 5-7 days you might want to think about eating out in town a couple of times if you want something other than the on-site restaurant or room service.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Safferboy wrote a review Jan 2015,50,Simply wonderful,We booked a stay at the Sirayane based on good reports online and the general impression of the hotel from its website. But could we trust them all? Our first day at the Sirayane we left our luggage at the concierge earlier in the morning to minimise disruption to our plans for the day. We had loads planned. And the staff were extremely accommodating with this request to sort us out. We finally arrived back after a busy day in the Atlas Mountains at about 18:00 and were really impressed that the owner was there to greet us personality. Cases had already been taken upstairs and our triple prestige room was set up beautifully - even the room temperature was perfect from a chilly evening outside. That and time in the spacious luxurious shower! Staff arranged dinner for us that evening which was really great after a day of hiking and sight-seeing. The menu catered for everyone: A General Menu and a traditional Moroccan Menu too. Staff were just about the best we have experienced in ages. Excellent manners perfect table-side manner and willing to offer good suggestions from their sound knowledge of the menu. Prices were pretty reasonable too. So needless to say we booked for our second night dinner there straight away. We had a great night's rest in the comfortable beds that evening and we're glad that the hotel serves breakfast until 10:30 - unusual and great if you want a sleep-in! Breakfast itself was like dinner - a good selection of well-thought-out food - again with great waitering staff at hand to answer any questions on some of the Moroccan things on the menu. We decided to have a relaxing day at the pool both our days and thoroughly enjoyed the loungers the heated pool and the ability to order drinks - without even looking for staff - so easily. The wonderful sun and blue sky was the cherry on the top. Talk about unwinding and relaxing. Yes we had a simply wonderful stay at the Sirayane. This is a really beautiful hotel. It has great rooms plenty of little corners to read books to lounge and to ponder - without being aware that there is anyone around when you'd like it to be quiet. But the really wonderful part over and above this fact is the fantastic staff. They are not just a wonderfully competent and friendly bunch but who people who genuinely want to make you stay at the Sirayane thoroughly enjoyable and memorable. And this they certainly did. In our books you guys score a resounding 10/10. We are just disappointed we could be staying longer than three days.

Beautiful setting luxurious rooms and amazing staff all made for a fantastic family trip to celebrate our Silver Wedding Anniversary. We were made so welcome felt instantly relaxed and actually find it difficult to fault at all. I think the ethos of the owner Medhi has driven a very special culture within the management team and all of the staff - everyone is happy smiling helpful and attentive - from the food and beverage manager who is ever present and checking how your meals are the attentive and friendly waiters the very helpful reception staff - to the pool guy who lays out towels as he sees you approaching the (immensely comfortable double) sunbeds and fetches umbrellas when you need shade. The NYE gala dinner was expensive but once we experienced it we realised why - superb entertainment wonderful food and an ambiance that felt special from the moment we walked into the beautifully decorated bar for cocktails and canap√©s. We will never forget the evening. Add to that the regular free shuttle that takes you to and from the Medina and I can't think why anyone would choose to stay in a a Riad when they could escape to this perfect oasis at the end of each day.,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Marlow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/329KarenF
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Zainab K wrote a review Jan 2015,10,Not a five star! Unprofessional staff.,We did not enjoy our stay at the Sirayane. The staff urgently needs hospitality training.  Facility:  The hotel is advertised as a five star luxury resort but it is distinctly not up to that standard. There is also no meaningful benefit from its out of town location. The compound is small so the boundaries are all too visible and confining. If you consider venturing out of the hotel there is nothing to see in the surrounding area.  Staff:  Probably the worst part of the experience was the organisation of the staff. Some employees were well meaning and trying to deliver service albeit with weakness in execution. Other employees were either rude or difficult to identify. A lot of employees were hanging around in the bar/restaurant area some dressed as hotel staff others not. It was never clear whom you could ask for service and it was certainly very clear that service requests were not particularly welcome. We received a lot of indiscrete and pushy questions be it about our choice of activities or plans though we made it clear we did not need assistance or were not interested in whatever the hotel was promoting. Worst of all were some of the drivers. On New Year's eve our driver was yelling on the telephone and swerving making our travel both dangerous and unpleasant. Lastly the hotel sent us an a visit to Ourika valley where the guide was paid 100 MAD but we were charged 300 MAD. For the organised visits to town or the valley no receipts were issued and cash was demanded payable to the drivers a highly intransparent arrangement.  Food:  We tried room service twice. The food was way below average. Breakfast was a disappointment and at the dot of 10:30 we were asked to leave!  Reception:  The reception was not keen on acting as the central point of facilitation for the guests. For example we called asking to be connected to the spa and were told to not bother them again and dial directly. We decided to leave early without a refund and made alternative arrangements for our last remaining days in Marrakech. Instead of directly attending to the transaction and giving us our final bill the receptionist called the manager or owner. The purpose of that call is utterly incomprehensible to us. Maybe the manager needed to give permission for us to leave?    Overall this was a terrible hotel stay that nearly ruined our vacation in the beautiful city of Marrakech.,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Athens, Greece",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zainabk2015
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,flipflop138 wrote a review Jan 2015,50,Out of this world,We booked a week's stay after Christmas. It was heaven. The hotel is beautifully situated just outside the city with complimentary shuttles running throughout the day for guests to travel into Marrakesh. Lamia on reception helped us find our way around and guided us in choosing a trip to the Ourika valley.  The hotel is clean and modern and has a wonderful calming atmosphere. All the staff were exceptional and could not do enough for us. Breakfast in the sun on the patio overlooking the snow capped High Atlas Mountains was a pleasure every day.  We enjoyed all our meals in the hotel but also ate in Marrakesh a few evenings. The New Year Gala was amazing with traditional folk singers/ drummers belly dancers violinist and a Fire eater! A fun night overseen by the owner of the hotel who made a point of meeting everyone.  Marrakesh is a crazy place which comes alive at night ( watch out for the volunteer guides who will follow you when you get off your shuttle although they will guide you through the Souks) . They don't need paying they work for commission when you buy something.  In winter you need jumpers and jackets when the sun goes down it's quite chilly.  We stayed in a suite with private pool which was a true luxury. We would love to come again well done to all the staff at Sirayane.,Date of stay: December 2014,,"Worcester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flipflop138
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Traveler007_13 wrote a review Jan 2015,50,Made our Marrakesh stay perfect,We booked the hotel for our 8 day honeymoon in Marrakech and I can't say we were disappointeWe booked the hotel for our 8 day honeymoon in Marrakech and I can't say we were disappointed. The hotel sorted out an upgrade to one of their best rooms before we even arrived and also arranged our shuttle service.    The flight was slightly delayed however the shuttle service was there as promised. Comfortable ride from the airport however it can look a little scary as you get to the hotel as a lot of the surrounding area is being developed.    The large gates that welcome you are themselves enclosed in high walls. It makes you feel like you are in a palace.    Beautiful architecture stunning decor and that is just the reception area. The staff are excellent we were told to sit down while they checked us in and offered some wonderful mint tea while we waited. The bell boy took our luggage to our room and we were escorted by the reception attendant.    Because we had arrived on a delayed flight they had made us a dinner reservation at the restaurant. Dinner was excellent a real quality taste of Moroccan cuisine it is more pricy than the red square however! But worth it.    The room was very well appointed with its own garden and lounging area overlooking the pool. A very comfortable bed with luxurious linens with matching bedside tables. There was ample storage and a mini fridge full of drinks. The walk-in shower was set with marble and had a very powerful shower. Complimentary toiletries were provided on a daily basis along with fresh towels slippers and robes.    We met the owner who was most pleasant taking time to talk to us and show us around the grounds.    The breakfast was good however they didn't do a full English which was a pity. You can get an omelette with what ever you wish which we had on a number of days that's does taste very good.    There are 2 pools on site 1 is heated and the other isn't! There are lots of loungers around the pool area and a very good pool boy who quickly gets you everything you need to relax he even moves the sun shade throughout the day.    The lunches and dinners are very good here especially the room service. The kitchen staff like to accommodate you where ever you can so just ask if you would like something specific. I regularly had the mixed grill with a side of Harissa sauce which was gorgeous.    This place is a true gem of Marrakech with only 40-odd suites it feels luxurious and exclusive. I look forward to coming again some day.,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Newbold, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveler007_13

We needed to move to a modern hotel with polished stone marble etc. it was our good fortune to find Sirayane. The hotel truly is luxurious the dining and the breakfast delicious. A very efficient navette service takes you to and from the city centre. There are spectacular views over the outdoor pool to the Atlas mountains. But best of all are the staff. There are many and every one of them is special. Thanks to them my wife got back on her feet and we had a wonderful holiday.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Edua E wrote a review Dec 2014,50,The Sirayane is first class once again....,I stayed at the Sirayane last year at Christmas and it was first class again this year. The owner Mehdi is an uttertly charming gentleman who makes a point of ensuring that you have a good stay. This ethos is shared by the managers the reception spa waiting staff and drivers. They are all friendly and only too willing to help. The location of the hotel is just outside of Marrakesh which is great for the airport and there is a frequently running shuttle bus which takes you into the centre if you wish to do some sightseeing. This year I spent most of my time relaxing at the hotel and enjoying the sun. I had a high standard room - very stylishly decorated clean and with great amenities (with my own private garden). The breakfast is recommended as all the produce is fresh and there is a lot of choice. I am very tempted to come here again next year and make it a hat trick!...,Date of stay: December 2014,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eduae
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,RVVH wrote a review Dec 2014,40,Great stay in Marrakech!,Me and my partner just returned from Marrakech having spent 3 nights and 4 days at the peaceful Sirayana Boutique Hotel & Spa. We made a last minute decision to book this hotel after looking at the Sofitel. When we arrived we received a very friendly and warm welcome. We were seated by reception and given some Moroccan tea which we really enjoyed. We had arrived an hour or so before check-in time but were told that our room would be made available asap. We only had to wait around 20 mins before we were shown around the hotel and taken to our room. First impressions of the hotel: it was large and spacious - huge doors and modern d√©cor. The location was the only small fault of this hotel if I had to pick one it is down a dark dusty and bumpy road which looks like the middle of nowhere! However after staying here and using the shuttle service it wasn't too bad and we realised it was quite safe getting a taxi back. On arrival we were given a list of the spa offers and treatments and the shuttle timetable which needed to be booked 2 hours in advance however the hotel was so quite that we didn't have to give this much notice. So we arrived to our privilege room and it was stunning a lot of people had told us to stay at a Riad but we are more hotel people and we definitely didn't regret not booking a Riad as this hotel definitely had a Moroccan vibe. Our room was very spacious and had a cool layout which made it look bigger the room is all one the bathroom is not separate only the toilet is which was actually nice. We had a small terrace balcony with a sofa outside. There is a safe in the room temperature control (remote) and a bottle of water is provided free on your first day. We went straight to the restaurant for some food which was really good! The staff made my partner a chicken burger instead of beef and were so accommodating. We had some mojitos which were quite good my partner has a very high standard for cocktails as he used to own a bar company so if he says they are good then they really are. The weather was quite warm so after eating we decided to go outside and lounge by the pool there is a pool guy who puts towels on your lounger for you and monitors the pool temperature etc. Whilst the sun was out it was quite warm but as soon as clouds appeared it was quite cold! I had to use a towel as a blanket as on holiday I am used to hot weather in the 30's range so I was really cold. It was about 20 degrees but didn't feel like it. Overall we were disappointed with the weather during our stay as it rained a few days and was very cold in the evenings pretty much like London! So we didn't get the winter sun we had hoped for nevertheless it was a fun filled trip. The hotel staff were amazing and we met with the hotel manager a few times who introduced himself and shook our hands he also recommended a few places to us to go out which was very helpful. Our room was always cleaned and we felt like family rather than guests. The hotel bar/ sports/ shisha lounge was a nice place to relax and we visited it twice one evening after returning from a night in the town and on the day of departure. The shisha was good and the room is very comfortable for relaxing. On our last day we used the spa which was good but not very big. For a spa hotel it could have been better there could have been a jacuzzi and perhaps an indoor pool there is plenty of space for it if they wanted to. We booked a couples hamam and a separate oriental massage each. Both were very good the hamam however not so relaxing! We preferred the massage which we had for an hour each. The hotel allowed us to use all of the facilities on the day of check-out and were able to extend our check-out time to 2pm which was helpful and after which stored out luggage for us. The guy who operated the shuttle service was very friendly and on the first night took us directly to the restaurant we wanted to go to instead of just dropping us in the square and we just paid him what we would have paid a taxi from the square to the restaurant (the pick-up and drop off point for the shuttle is the mosque which is a landmark so not easily missed!). A tip: you have to bargain hard with the taxi drivers they will always bump up the price by at least 100 dirhams so just keep pushing even to the point where you say no don't worry I will find another taxi and they will always accept your price in the end! Also be careful in the square of belongings but otherwise it is fairly safe and fun if you see the lighter side of things. Overall we had a very pleasant stay at this hotel and would definitely return - there are only 26 rooms so the hotel has a personal touch which we loved. We will wait until it is a bit warmer to come back! We regret not being able to go on a camel ride or visit the Atlas mountains which I have heard are a must. Highly recommend this hotel if you don't want to be right in the middle of the hustle and bustle and prefer travelling into the square.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,ShurlockHomes wrote a review Dec 2014,50,Perfect December Getaway!,Have just spent last week staying at the Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa on the outskirts of Marrakesh. This really is an excellent place to stay and perfectly located for both the airport (15 mins away) and the Medina (Old Town) of Marrakesh (20 mins away).  We booked double rooms half-board meals and an airport pickup all done very efficiently over email with the hotel reservations. The airport pickup was efficient with no hassle and we were swiftly delivered to the hotel.    We were greeted by the hotel owner Mehdi who is an extremely friendly and helpful gentleman and during our stay he was available to help everyday...he appears to be very hands-on with his customers.    The hotel was well presented and we were extremely pleased to be offered upgrades on all our rooms (3) to suites for the week. These rooms were very comfortable with all the amenities you would expect from a 5* hotel. The weather was just perfect for the whole week and we were even able to try out the pools (there are two and one is heated so you can swim and relax even when the air temperature is a little lower).    We also meet two other managers at the hotel Adil and Bader both very friendly people and always willing to talk to you and offer their local advice. Special thanks to Adil for allowing me to climb onto the hotel rooftop to catch the wonderful sunrises over the Atlas Mountains each morning...the views are just stunning. Aissam and Lamia also worked on the front desk and were very helpful during our stay answering any questions we had about Morocco and visiting Marrakesh.    The half-board meal arrangements worked out well for us too. Breakfast consisted of either a choice of hot or cold foods and the selection was varied offering long opening times too so we could have our breakfast at our leisure. Evening meal was also good choice of Moroccan style or more European dishes were on offer. Anas & Zidane who worked in the restaurant was extremely helpful and always available to describe the dishes in more detail and the service was excellent.    We also used the Spa and Basty provided a wonderful massage. The Spa environment is calm and relaxing and allows the perfect remedy for a long day walking in the Medina of Marrakesh.    I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are planning a visit to Marrakesh. It is easily accessible from the airport flights are only 3hrs from London and it also offers free shuttle services to/from the centre of town which is only 20 mins ride.    Very peaceful and relaxing location with excellent views of the Atlas Mountain range. Mehdi and his team of over 60 employees (for 28 rooms) are a credit to their countries hospitality and we would definately go back to Marrakesh and stay at the Sirayane when we next have the opportunity.

The owner was very hands on greeting us every day and making sure we were ok this was a nice touch and not something you see very often. The location was good away from the hustle & bustle but close enough (by complementary shuttle bus) to get into the centre easily.

It is indeed an excellent place for honeymooners or anyone who really needs a good relaxing environment after a long months of hard work.    Rooms are big enough especially if you opt for the one with the private garden and private pool. The pool was also big enough to swim comfortably and anytime you wish in any way you wish :)... it's just all yours. The garden was beautiful too well taken care of a small sitting place is already there whenever you wish to relax under the soft sun of the month of November.    The staff were always ready to help anytime you ask for it. A quite decent room service cleaning twice a day... The food is decent not great not bad neither. For what you get prices may need to be re-adjusted. Sometimes you better eat at the restaurant if you don't want to get served a cold dish. Better to order well in advance of your planned eating times.    Thumbs up to the owner (Mr Mehdi) who was always ready to answer your questions and even more always asking you and making sure everything is fine during your stay.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,GollMall wrote a review Dec 2014,50,Great boutique hotel,Just got back this week from this hotel. We went on a spa break with friends and this hotel was perfect.    Good points-  - the service is amazing staff are always floating about and very attentive. Special mention to Anas the restaurants manager and Mohammed at breakfast.  Both these guys were brilliant.    - spa is very good. We had Hammam treatments massages and facials. Facial was so so but Hammam and massages were amazing. We had ladies called Bastist and Souad who were very experienced and very good at what they did. Prices were very reasonable.    - food. We ate on a half board basis and have to say the food was amazing. Best beef I have ever had. The international menu was brilliant worth a Michelin star or two we thought. The morrocon menu was pretty good too. Very good value on half board for the standard of food.    - rooms and hotel itself.  As another reviewer said I don't think the hotel coped well with the cool weather we had whilst we were there. Very drafty and we also huddled in front of the log fire in the lounge which was kept going.  Rooms are lovely modern and stylish.  The ambience of the hotel was lovely boutique quiet and suited to adults. However there were children there but I'm not sure it's suited to children.    It's a lovely spa/relaxing break hotel and I would definitely reccomend.    - shuttle to town. We used this and it's well worth it.    We also used the hotel transfer to and from the airport which was fine if you didn't want the hassle of negotiating your own taxi.  Overall a lovely spa break hotel with service that very few hotels offer and amazing food. The hotel owner also pops around to say hello which is a lovely touch.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Bluesky wrote a review Dec 2014,50,Hidden gem with excellent service,Having arrived at Sirayane following a rainy arrival I was pleasantly surprised at the atmosphere within the hotel once we arrived as I had not really known what to expect. We were greeted with mint tea and I immediately felt more comfortable. The room was arranged for us within half an hour as we had arrived slightly early which was appreciated after a long journey. The room was really comfortable and clean and we were upgraded to a suite which was an added bonus. It would have been nice to have a couple of nibbles in the mini bar for emergencies but nothing that could not easily be fixed. I was really pleased with the food and we had great meals each night with plenty of choice. The breakfast also offered excellent choice and the fresh fruit was lovely. The warm cosy fire was really appreciated and the staff regularly topped up the wood without us having to ask. The service was really pleasant and we never felt like we had to go out of our way to ask for anything  there was always someone there to offer help. The free shuttle bus to town was great and allowed us to dip into Marrakech for as long as we wanted to. One of the only down sides was the temperature in the hotel at some points which was rather cold. I don't think the hotel was used to the low temperatures as we were told it was the worst weather Marrakech had had for a long time. On another side note we ended up being 45 mins late for our transfer to the airport. We were told by the receptionist that we should have received an email but that was not the case. Whilst I appreciate this was organised through Thompson  I do feel we could have been told by reception at breakfast that our taxi was waiting for us as the staff seemed to know our room number and it could have saved a bit of embarrassment. All in all it was a welcome retreat for a wonderful relaxing weekend. Best hotel I have stayed in for a long time and I will definitely recommend!! Thank you to all the staff and I hope this hotel continues to get the excellent reviews it deserves.

Be mindful if it's your first time to marrakech that you bring with you any personal items you may need from local shops as there none in walking distance however they do provide a free shuttle bus into (you must book 2 hours in advance) Medina you have to wait until a pickup of at least 90 minutes unless you wish to get a taxi back.

Arrived with pre-booked Taxi to Hotel was taken back it's isolated position from main City Centre.  Never disappointed was treated courteously & given Tea whilst waiting for room. The Owner had made an upgrade gesture despite what we thought might not been busy but it had almost 90% occupancy.    The Hotel architecture may look modern but did not lack the Class. Very well designed to make all amenities easily accessible & central. It's not a large hotel packed with guests but decidedly small & perfect for total relaxing of the soul.    Never been to a hotel where staying at Hotel & visiting the Medina's (Centre Marrakech) was such contrasting but equally opposite experience.    The Hotel rooms are cleaned spotless with good amenities. The Place personifies calm & tranquillity so we just lumbered by pool with glorious warmth of the sun & used facilities. Surrounded by most beautiful tropical plants cactuses & perfumed scents of the flowers in bloom.    Whilst Marrakech central wakes up your senses the Hotel brings you down to meditate levels of inner peace. Free return shuttle available to Medina via request!    We were treated like relatives not guests. Staff are brilliant & better very genuine compared to larger known hotels we have stayed at previously.  Food are in abundance varieties & very high standards at Lunch or Dinner although could be priced cheaper. Drinks are available but similar European prices.    I guess the prices paid by guests maintains the high standards set by the Owner (Mr Mehdi) & pays the number of Staff he employs. Don't let you deter from visiting Sirayane that would be an injustice to your unique experience of this lovely Hotel.    Marrakech by comparison is mayhem personified City with hustle & bustle of Street traders to markets to Cafes to small children begging with it's human characters of warmth despite daily adversities faced by it's people.

I can safely say that it did indeed live up to our expectations and then went on to exceed them.  The owner greeted us warmly on arriving check-in was very quick and then we had a brief tour of the hotel it was 7pm by now and we were asked if we would like a table reserved in the restaurant. We had already planned to eat at the hotel on our first night but this was the first of many occasions when the staff anticipated our needs.  The food was delicious the menu varied and the service impeccable so much so that we actually dined at the hotel on 3 of our 5 nights.  Breakfast the next morning was another culinary delight fresh fruit and juices various hot choices and delicious cakes and pastries eggs cooked anyway you choose are available on request. All this with very friendly staff wishing you a cheery good morning and asking if you slept well‚Ä¶which of course we did because the rooms are beautiful and the beds comfortable! Sitting eating a leisurely breakfast in the early morning sun every morning my coffee cup being discreetly refilled constantly was sheer bliss no school run!  We had rooms with a private garden the bathrooms and showers were wonderful and rooms were cleaned every day. Fresh towels everyday too. Beds were turned down in the evening and small bottles of water left by the bed-side.  We used the hotel courtesy shuttle bus into Marrakesh several times the driver was helpful and accommodating. The hotel also arranged taxis for us on several occasions and this was all straightforward too.  The pool area was clean and so relaxing towels were laid out for you the minute you stood by a sun lounger and the staff came around every 15 minutes or so for drinks orders. Cocktails and local wine were very nice by the way!  I didn‚Äôt personally use the spa but my friends did several times and said it was amazing.  I can honestly say the staff helped make our stay at this wonderful hotel so memorable they have exactly the right balance between professionalism and friendliness. Nothing appears too much trouble for them. Even when we probably kept them from their beds ordering more cocktails in the bar way past midnight. Sorry about that!  I defy anyone to find fault with this hotel and I would return for a lazy weekend at the drop of hat.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Kent, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shashaKent

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Lauren-Steve wrote a review Nov 2014,50,"Wonderful Hotel, Amazing Staff, Great Food",We stayed at the Sirayane for the second part of our honeymoon in mid-October for 7 nights. We had just spent 4 days in Paris busily sight-seeing and walking so we booked the Sirayane for a luxury rest afterwards. That's exactly what we got!    As many reviews state the hotel is in the middle of nowhere. I contacted the hotel and organised an airport collection for 20 euros. When you arrive you are greeted with some gorgeous mint tea and a tour of the hotel. It is very minimalist but very beautiful. Everywhere is spotlessly clean. What stood out straight away was the initial contact with the staff. They were amazingly attentive (not too attentive where you feel uncomfortable). We were shown to our room which was in the main building overlooking the pool. The first impressions were great. The room was spacious and airy and in keeping with the d√©cor of the hotel.    After arrival we went straight down to the pool. The pool attendant was there before we were laying down our towels. Throughout the stay if we nipped for lunch he would rearrange the beds to face the sun for us. The beds are like big couches and are very comfortable. There are 2 pools; a smaller heated one and a larger one which is very cold (but very refreshing)!    As we were on our honeymoon to relax we knew that we wouldn't go into Marrakech much so we chose the 'half board' option. This is something that usually we would never have done as we love eating out but we are so glad we did. There are 2 menus; a 'gastronomy' one and a Moroccan one. If you go on the Sirayane website you can see the menus on there. If you are planning on eating there for the majority of the time then it is more reasonably priced. We never had a bad meal. In fact the majority were really very good. The Moroccan Biroutte starter (a selection of savoury pastries) was excellent. Then I discovered that fillet steak was on the gastronomy menu. We both had quite a few of those!! The meat was gorgeous and so tender (they even cooked it perfectly rare). I know it's not very 'Moroccan' but a fillet steak of that quality would be difficult to find at home for that price. Of note if you are half board you can mix and match the courses from both menus. The deserts were also all very good. The breakfast in the morning was a buffet style with the option to order omelettes. There was a lot of choice of cold meals with limited hot choices. The selection of juices is good and the omelettes were lovely.    Drinks are around the same price as in the UK. The Moroccan house white wine was around ¬£15 a bottle and was very nice. The cocktails were nice but they were stronger in the evening. What was very lovely was when you ordered alcoholic drinks during the day the staff would also bring a selection of lovely olives and nuts for you to snack on. It was very nice having a nice glass of wine in the afternoon with some nibbles when sat around the pool. My husband said the house red was also very nice. Maybe if we weren't on honeymoon where money was no issue we may have felt a bit different about the drink pricing. However I suppose you do have to keep in mind that it is a 5* hotel.    Sadly during the first few days the weather was very hit and miss. Before we went I had booked a massage for us both via email. When we arrived we were told about an offer where 2 people could each have a hammam scrub followed by a massage for 1200 DHM (I think around ¬£80) so I was able to change our booking to incorporate the offer. The hammam went on for around an hour and it was a great experience. The therapist worked so hard! We both went in together and thoroughly enjoyed our first hammam experience. The massage was also lovely and very relaxing. It is definitely worth checking in advance to see if they have any offers on!    We only got the bus into Marrakech once and it was on time and very comfortable. They run a good few times throughout the day. You just need to book the trip around 2 hours before to ensure there is enough room. I love Marrakech but on this occasion we weren't there to shop or sightsee however it was nice to have the option of the free shuttle.    I think the main thing that stood out for both of us was the service provided by the staff They were amazing. They were friendly funny and very charming. By the last 3 nights they knew the exact drinks we would have and say 'the usual' which was very sweet. The owner is a lovely man. He greeted us several times and always asked how things were. On the last night he came and discussed our early flight the next morning (he obviously is very involved with the running of the hotel) and told us he would have some juices and snacks ready for us at 4am.    We knew how great the place was on the last day when we both felt deflated about leaving and our honeymoon coming to an end. On the last night more honeymooners arrived and were given some champagne. This is not a criticism but we were never given any and we had spent a lot of money there so maybe something like that would have been a nice touch. They were aware that it was our honeymoon as I informed them when I booked. It's always nice to get a little treat when celebrating a special occasion so my advice to the staff would be that people should be treated the same in those situations.    Overall it was a lovely break and just what we needed. Highly recommended for a special trip. I would return for a short break to relax in an instant!!!,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lauren-Steve
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,thebyre wrote a review Oct 2014,50,Beautiful Boutique Hotel,This is a beautiful hotel with a very friendly welcome of hot mint tea as soon as we stepped outside the door. The hotel is about ten minutes from the medina but they lay on a complimentary shuttle which is regular and very nice. The rooms are laid out around the pool in bungalow style. Rose petals are scattered in the room and on the bed every day. We had a problem with our air conditioning and it was fixed in half an hour. Great service. The food is very good and the waiters very helpful in explaining the dishes. Breakfast is varied and very nice. Lunch menu has lots of variety and dinner is a choice of set menus which reflect the local cuisine and are great value and very tasty. Lots of proper cushioned double sun loungers and the pool attendant provides an endless supply of fresh towels. This holiday was total relaxation and made absolutely perfect by possibly the best service I have ever experienced.

It was the little things that made the difference such as a nightly turn down service and bottled water by your bed which made this so great.  The room was beautiful as was the pool area.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,259susieq6 wrote a review Oct 2014,50,Fantastic Boutique Hotel,"We have just returned from a 7 night stay at the Sirayane.    The main reasons for booking was we expected a quality hotel that was large enough to have all the facilities we wanted but small enough to get the ""personal"" touch. The hotel and staff exceeded our expectations on all counts.    We booked the hotel taxi & on arrival were met by the manager and one of his team where we received a lovely welcome together with our first taste of Moroccan Mint Tea. After an explanation of the hotel facilities whilst our bags were taken to our room we were shown to our room which contained a huge double bed. Special touches such as rose petals tea tray and biscuits mini bar were a nice welcome.    Every day the manager would come to us when we were around the hotel to ensure everything was well and his staff were looking after us if we needed anything. The staff were excellent we were impressed with all of them and this made our stay most enjoyable.    We used the free hotel taxi everyday to go into Marrakech town either day time and back for an enjoyable leisurely evening meal at the Hotel or we stayed and used the hotel facilities in the day and experienced evening meals around the Medina. You do need to book the day before for the taxi service to be sure there is enough space.    On our last day we made use of the Hotel Spa which was a pleasant relaxing experience for both of us.    The hotel manager came to see us to say he would try to arrange for us to keep our rooms as long as possible after the regulation check out time and he was as good as his word and we were able to keep our room for several hours. A late lunch/early dinner and drinks in the hotel and it was time to leave. We used the hotel taxi for the airport (there is a charge for airport pick up and drop off).    Our bags were loaded in the boot and the manager came to say goodbye.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Dominic M wrote a review Oct 2014,40,Tranquility away from the busy Medina,"We visited Sirayane to get some relaxation rather than a Riad in the hustle and bustle of the Medina. It delivered.    For EUR 20 the hotel organised for their shuttle to pick us up from the airport. We'd definitely recommend this as haggling with a taxi driver over 5 euros or so after a four hour flight is not worth it.    We were greeted by the Owner and the Manager who were almost always present and happy to help out with restaurant recommendations and ensuring we were being catered for appropriately.    The rooms are big clean and all have a garden with a pool view. The pool itself is very large given the number of guests and there is no rush for the sun loungers in the morning. The staff are very friendly and happy to assist wherever possible. The spa was lovely and I would definitely recommend getting a treatment of some sort as they are very well priced. The hotel restaurant is actually very good for lunch and dinner. I was not so keen on the complimentary breakfast but dinner was significantly better than other hotel restaurants.    I would definitely recommend staying here.    However my only pieces of ""constructive feedback"" are that the private gardens are very tired so I wouldn't get excited about that and the breakfast buffet was not that great - but given it is included in the room price one shouldn't expect the standard to be phenomenal.",Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dominicm913

There is no panic for sun beds as there are enough for everyone. There is an International and Modern Morrocan menu - both delicious.

Alas it was also my birthday and my husband wasn't sure he was well enough to join me for dinner. The team however had organised a special meal for my husband and some thyme tea. And for me they had made a delicious cake and champagne! Everyday they were asking how my husband was feeling and doing anything they could to make our stay better and more comfortable.    I enjoyed the spa so much that I went two days in a row and with the current strength of the pound the prices were great. The chocolate fondant at the restaurant is to die for.    We didn't take advantage of the shuttle to Marrakesh as we'd stayed just inside near the Medina several nights before.

It is without doubt the most tranquil and relaxed hotel I have ever stayed in.    We had a garden room which was spacious and spotlessly clean.    The staff cannot do enough to help make your stay better or to make you feel welcome.    The free shuttle service is excellent - punctual and convenient. We also used the airport transfer provided which is 20 euros per journey and is charged to your hotel bill.    There is a new chef and although the food last year was tasty this year it was outstanding. They have put a modern twist on some of the usual traditional dishes.    Bar service and around the pool is excellent and we were always greeted with a friendly smile and they always remembered our preferred drinks!    Even the man who sets the towels out would rush to help us every morning and remember where we always sit.    We had a hamman scrub followed by one of the best massages I have ever had. This was a two hour experience and very reasonably priced.    As you can tell I cannot recommend this place highly enough and hope to be back there some time soon!

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Jason C wrote a review Oct 2014,40,Nice but rough around the edges,On the whole this is a nice resort however it needs a bit more attention to detail to be a real 5 star boutique resort.    The location is good 15 minutes from the airport but not on the flight path and 15 minutes from the Medina. It is about a mile down a track off the main road so you cannot walk to anything. However the resort offers a free shuttle to the Medina or you can book a private transfer for less than ¬£2 each way.    The hotel itself has a spa with a small gym (bike cross trainer treadmill and free weights) communal room with a pool table library/seating area with a computer bar area restaurant and two pools.    The larger of the two pools is unheated and the smaller pool is heated during the winter. This means that most people use the smaller of the two pools. If there are families staying they can sometimes dominate the pool area. So if you're looking for peace and quiet sit around the larger pool near the main building. During my stay there was a section of marble that had broken off the corner of the pool and some of the small tiles were missing. The sides of the pool had also gone green in places. Instead of sun loungers they have padded double beds with pillows. This is great if you are there as a couple but not if you are with friends or an uneven numbered party. It also poses a problem if you want to read as you can't prop yourself up. The drinks service around the pool was often slow to non-existent. Generally the staff would not circulate until 11.30am and then it would be a quick walk around the pool with head down. Be prepared to keep a look out and flag them down if you're thirsty.    I stayed in a garden room. The rooms are nice but missing a couple of things such as an iron and ironing board (although there is a laundry/pressing service) and a clock. There's one wardrobe with hanging space and a second with shelving. The shower is a walk in shower with frosted windows. However it is open to the bedroom so in the morning the room gets very light. The TV gets some English speaking channels and there is a DVD player and you can borrow DVD's from reception. It's nice to have a garden however it's open at the end so doesn't give a high degree of privacy. There is a sofa and two loungers on the grass. The grass has worn in places and gets muddy when the gardeners water it so the gardens could do with more paving or decking for the loungers.    The food is good and if you book a half or full board package you get a reserved table. The staff are very friendly and helpful but be prepared to wait for your food as service can be painfully slow. At breakfast you can ask for omelettes or fried eggs but generally aren't told this. The breakfast buffet has a good continental choice and a small selection of hot food. At lunch a smaller menu is available offering salads club sandwiches etc. At dinner there are two menus one more western and the other Moroccan. My only criticism is that sometimes it is more style over substance. The Moroccan menu is also short on some favourites such as tagines. The only one they offer is minced meatballs and egg. Again the service can be spectacularly slow although the waiting staff are very friendly and seem to work quicker on the nights that the owner is in. The local wines are good particularly the Sahari Reserve red and at ¬£15 it's not badly priced.    The owner was very helpful during the stay and managed to smooth over some of the shortcomings in the service. The spa is also good and I had a 1 hour sport massage which cost around ¬£30 maximum. They offer other treatments in a very smart spa area and all are competitively priced.    All in all it was an enjoyable and a relaxing stay and I would recommend the place however with a few tweaks it could be so much better.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jasonc75

Extremely well laid out and designed rooms and common areas including a great spa gym 2 excellent pools spacious lounges sports/pool room and even a paddle court (mini tennis). The food is at minimum great and service unfailingly excellent. One consideration is there is nothing within walking distance so bring whatever you need with you or take the regular free minibus into town...before rushing back to relax.

If you are thinking of visiting Marrakech I would strongly recommend this hotel.  It is a 15 min drive outside the main town quietly away from all the noise and bustle ideal if you want a quiet relaxing break.   It is not a big place but spacious airy clean everywhere with a lovely atmosphere. From the moment my friends and I arrived we felt very relaxed.  I have never experienced quite such good service and charming staff before.  Our rooms were kept spotlessly clean morning and evening.  There is a huge choice at the  buffet breakfast and the options we tried for lunch and dinner were delicious.  I had the most fantastic relaxing massage in the spa and might have had more treatments if we were there a little longer.     My friends and I had never been to Marrakech before and were a bit nervous about travelling around and visiting the main part of the town but the hotel reception staff helped by arranging the free minibus with a helpful driver (or private minibus when we were travelling at other times) booking restaurants and even organising someone to escort us from the drop off point to the restaurant if it was hard to find (as most are located in the rather intimidating dark alleyways) which was very much appreciated.  They also organised a day long tour which I would recommend if you are unfamiliar with the town.  We were able to name the places we wanted to see and fitted in the Majorelle Gardens; Bahia Palace; the Saadian Tombs;  a great lunch in a lovely garden restaurant in the more modern part of town; a presentation at a Herbalist shop and (to my cost!) a very nice leather shop with quite persuasive staff.  We finished up by going on to Jemma el-Fnaa square and the honeycomb of alleyways that are the souks.  We would never have found all the places we wanted to visit in one day and our guide eased our entrance in to the various locations and showed us something of the ""real"" parts of Marrakech where the workers are.    After this we felt much more confident to go on our own to the Souks and the square and had great fun haggling with the stall holders which I did not expect to enjoy so much.  Having said that I would not walk around at night without my friends!

You do need to book a couple of hours in advance but that worked quite well for us and gave us the opportunity to explore the town without paying out for cabs. We had a room with private garden which was lovely and meant we didn't have to always sit by the pool if we wanted some privacy. The hotel was very peaceful and we couldn't help but feel relaxed.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Jo P wrote a review Oct 2014,50,Superb Hotel,This hotel is a real Oasis of calm. I hadn't been away with my best friend for about 20 years and we really just wanted a relaxing short break with a couple of shots of adrenaline thrown in that is Marrakesh. We certainly got what we were hoping for. A very different experience to the holidays we used to go on 20 years ago personally as I'm getting older I certainly want to have that extra bit of luxury when I go on holiday.  The Sirayane certainly gave us that and more. Our upgraded room was lovely fantastic view of the mountains in the morning. The bar and the restaurant are fantastic I don't think we sat inside once to eat very well set up for Al Fresco dining and very tranquil. Every meal I had was excellent both from the Moroccon and the International menu and the local white wine was delicious.  All that said I think the best asset this hotel has is it's staff they couldn't do enough for you from explaining the menu at dinner to serving drinks round the pool and a fantastic bar service. My particular thanks to Soufian and Enes who were both very attentive.  All in all I would highly recommend this hotel and will hopefully be returning with my lovely boyfriend one day!,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Great Dunmow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jop570
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Tony P wrote a review Sep 2014,50,Stunning.,As it was our honeymoon I wanted to go to some place that ticked all the boxes.  And after a week of searching I stumbled upon the Sirayane.  I read the reviews on trip advisor and booked immediately.  There were a few negative reviews and from a personal perspective the people that left them can't of realised they were in North Africa. This hotel in my opinion is as close to perfect as you can get.  You are met at the airport by a very curious driver seamless transfer from the airport to the hotel. Yes it's not travelling on beautiful smooth Roads but remember where you are.  Once inside the gates you are cocooned in comfort. The lobby is entered by massive doors and the reception is stunning.  You are given a seat whilst the receptionist books you in. And as if by magic the mint tea arrives.  From there while your bags are moved to your room you are given a guided tour.  The whole hotel is well laid out and feels more like a home than a hotel.  You are looked after so well and nothing is too much trouble.  After weeks of wedding prep and hard work it was such a release to be staying at the Sirayane.  We had a private gardened room which was stunning but I decided prior to arriving to upgrade to the junior suite. Well worth it.  Not that the pool area is busy or any less maintained as it is lush. The pool is cool and clean. A welcome release from the Moroccan heat.  The sun beds are clean an comfy and if you want a cold drink then waiters are on hand.  The rooms them selves are immaculate and you are greeted with rose petals and fruit.  Air con is set and the room is nicely chilled when you arrive.  The restaurant and bar are beautiful. And the food is out of this world. My new wife has something to live up to on our return to the UK!!!  Yes the drinks are fairly expensive. But if you want to get smashed then this isn't the place for you.  I believe the Sirayane is about relaxing getting totally away from everything that makes you need a holiday and spending time in the company of the one you love surrounded by peace and the occasional bird song.  The owner really knows what his guests want. The decor is immaculate and he takes time to say hi and to make sure everything is perfect with your stay.  Any problems and they are dealt with immediately for instance we had a shower head that was faulty 30 minutes and it was fixed.  We leave tomorrow ( sadly ) but we are already looking forward to our next visit and a visit by my other half her mum and sister.  I thoroughly recommended this hotel and as stated above we will definitely be back.  A big Thank you to every member of staff whether seen or behind the scenes you helped us to have a wonderful honeymoon.,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Melksham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyP42
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,SusieBloosie wrote a review Sep 2014,50,The most perfect hotel,This hotel and the whole experience at this hotel was wonderful. We got there quite late and were greeted with a much appreciated mint tea (so yummy) and a sit down with a member of staff who gave us information about the hotel and took us on a personal tour - of the hotel and to our (upgraded) room with our own personal garden. The room was lovely very cosy and very Moroccan! The customers service in this hotel was EXCEPTIONAL. Everyone was so helpful and friendly I can honestly say I have never been to a hotel where I was treated like such an individual. The owner introduced himself and was very friendly. The best part was that because the hotel was relatively small it was so relaxing quiet and felt like our own little community. The pool was lovely and the sun loungers were like beds - so comfy! The food was fantastic - traditional Moroccan. This was such a relaxing hotel - the location was fairly far out but this was a good thing because it was so quiet. The free shuttle bus (about 15 mins into the main square) was so handy. One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in and the best one for customer service.

The owner is very nice and interested in how your stay is going.  The food is fantastic both at breakfast (omelettes were very tasty!) and at dinner (not cheap but very good value).  The pool is good. There was never a problem with getting a bed by the pool. The attendants are very attentive.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,treswow wrote a review Sep 2014,40,Great Service/A little sterile,On your way out to this hotel you may feel your heading to a wasteland in the middle of nowhere. Rest assured you will arrive at a beautiful setting. The service is personable and efficient the rooms are typical of a modern hotel and everything feels new here. The pool is large and they have a smaller heated pool as well. On a clear day you can spot the atlas mountains. We stayed here for a night at the end of our trip and although nice it felt a little impersonable and not very Moroccan. In saying that the service and rooms were faultless so this is just a personal taste. The free transfers in and out of Marrakech were reliable and very handy.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Adelaide, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/treswow

The reception at the hotel is very big and welcoming - we got served with tea and were waiting in a nice waiting area. Room with garden and pool was amazing! First time having my private pool and I loved it:)  Food and drinks is on the expensive side and you are far from any stores or city. Breakfast was lovely and bar service good.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Gill S wrote a review Sep 2014,50,"Excellent peaceful hotel, perfect base for visiting Marrakech",My second visit but first for my daughter . Extremely warm welcome as a returning guest from owner and staff which was lovely. Hotel is beautiful very modern with striking design. Stayed in a mini garden suite which was spacious and well planned. Room was kept immaculate by daily cleaning and towel change. Had breakfast buffet and also ate lunch and dinner on some days. Food was of a very high standard and served by highly professional and friendly staff. Shuttle bus into Marrakech was efficient and always on time making sight seeing easy at the coolest part of the day . The hotel is only about ten minutes drive from the city but this is a plus as you really welcome the peace after the hectic pace in the city centre. Reception staff responded promptly to requests and are available 24 hours. The pool is large with large sun beds round the edge . There are always enough beds and the pool attendant provides towels and parasols immediately you arrive at the pool. Nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff here from the owner to the man who lights the path at night if you are walking back to your room in the dark. The whole emphasis is on ensuring you have every comfort. Likewise the spa staff and facilities were great. I have nothing negative to say about this hotel  probably the best I have stayed in around the world including Hiltons.,Date of stay: August 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bolton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/110gills

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,JamesOB29 wrote a review Sep 2014,50,Luxury Boutique,I travelled to Marrakesh on Leisure and Business and had family/colleagues staying in various other hotels but i chose the Sirayane because of the great trip advisor reviews.  I chose correctly.  We were met at the airport punctually as was arranged via email before we arrived.  Upon checking in me and my girlfriend were given complimentary mint tea (which i loved) and told we were being upgraded to a better room with a great balcony over looking the pool and to top it all off an extra upgrade on our final night to a room with a private pool... this was a lovely gesture by the hotel.  The rooms were cleaned immaculately during our stay and the minibar always restocked with new water and soft drinks.  The staff were amazing and always checking we were ok they were all very courteous and helpful.  We ordered numerous taxis via the reception staff during our stay and all were on time and safely driven.  I never managed to grab dinner whilst i was here but the breakfast buffet and the lunches we had every day were lovely with plenty of options.  The only negative i would say is that the wifi was down during our stay but it was in the process of being fixed and there was an onsite computer station if the internet was needed.  I would stay here again if ever back in Morocco.,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamesOB29
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,not-my-dolly wrote a review Sep 2014,50,Lovely relaxing break,We stayed in the deluxe suite with pool and I can't speak highly enough of the room (or hotel) it is spacious well appointed and the garden is fantastic with it's own double bed and HUGE pool. The only time we left the room was for breakfast and dinner as you can have meals in the room with this room type so we took advantage of having lunch and a bottle of wine delivered every lunch time. We came here to get some sun relax and spend time together in beautiful surroundings and we weren't disappointed - because of this we had no reason to leave the hotel so can't comment on the taxi service or the surroundings. I would say this hotel is very well suited to couples.    We both adored the chicken salad with ginger and lemon and would love the recipe all of the food we ate was absolutely lovely but the standout meals are the huge lamb leg for two (I'm not sure if it's still on the menu but we found it on the website I do hope it's still available next year - well worth the supplement) the tagines were lovely all of the desserts we had were fantastic too. The value for money is excellent using full board and even the cheapest of wines on the menu were lovely.

Great for a day or two in the sunshine.  The owner was present on our arrival and on several occasions during our stay .

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Leigh-Harrington wrote a review Sep 2014,50,"A true oasis of wonderful luxury, service and food",We were met at the airport by the taxi the hotel arranged to pick us up and take us to the hotel which is about 20 mins from both the airport and the city centre. You travel along a quiet little access road and through the gates into a beautifully designed complex. The main blocks are designed to keep cool without ac so it doesn't waste fuel although your room does have ac to keep it down to a comfy 17o if you want. We were met by the first of the wonderful staff who arranged a quick tour of the facilities including the Spa gym sports bar with hubba bubba pipes internet and library areas and dining areas while our bags were taken to our room. We were upstairs in room 102 (there are only 28 in total) so we had a twin shower twin sinked bathroom with separate WC huge firm double (king at least) sized bed and a private balcony looking over the pool and offering views of the Atlas mountains (haze allowing). There is no iron but they offer a laundry service there is a mini bar and a safe in the room which also provides a turn down service with rose petals in the evening.  Given the location you either eat at the hotel or go into town on the free shuttle buses that runs from the hotel to the main square four of five times a day in each direction or a petit taxi will be about 100 dirham if you want to stay later that the 11.15pm last bus. The food in the hotel really was first rate. The breakfast range was huge and introduced us to the delights of cucumber juice and mint tea. We had lunch on the rare occasion we weren't blown from breakfast and that was excellent the pasta dishes were especially to our liking. Dinner is also a wonderful experience with two menu ranges. the food is fresh tasty and beautifully presented and the wine on offer along with the two local beers went down very well. The owner is often on hand to check that guests are happy and his staff reflect his commitment to excellence. Over the seven nights we only ate out twice and although it can be cheaper in town and it is worth going in a trying at least one meal out we just couldn't fault the food or the ambience eating outside(you can eat indoors if you want).  The pool area is large with a larger graduated depth pool and a smaller single depth one. There are pool beds permanently out with more than enough for everyone and the wonderfully attentive and hardworking pool attendant regularly wanders around to reposition the shades for you if you want them moving as the sun moves and the bar staff will bring drinks to you.  The hotel is luxurious peaceful and relaxing and the shuttle bus means you don't have to miss the hustle and bustle of town if you want to experience it but not have it keep you awake as you might experience with the call to prayer from some of the city Riads. We thought it was wonderful and fully intend to return,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leigh-Harrington
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Montefusco d wrote a review Sep 2014,50,Serene Sirayane,After a week of tranquility serenity and adventure in Marrakech we were truly sad to leave Sirayane. The hotel was the idyllic host to our city break/summer holiday vacation in which we had the facility to explore but more importantly relax.    The staff were professional and hospitable characters skilled in providing outstanding service to meet all of our needs throughout the week. The hotel owner was frequently roaming around the hotel greeting guests and ensuring everyones stay was perfect.    A free of charge shuttle bus runs throughout the day taking guests back and fourth to the manic medina. There are a selection of lovely restaurants that can be recommended by the hotel staff but if you are looking for a convenient and delicious taste of local cuisine then look no further than beyond the pool.    Despite several negative reviews on the ''prison'' like walls we personally had an aesthetic appreciation of Sirayane's contemporary arabic architecture and interior design. The hotel is also clean spacious and a welcoming retreat.    A few simple and positive suggestions: WiFi reception to be stronger across the whole premises a wider selection of cocktails to be made available and possibly some kind of locally traditional entertainment once a week or so for those quiet evenings.    This was our first trip to Marrakech and staying at the Sirayane made it a wonderful and memorable experience for us. We will definitely be visiting the city again with only one hotel in mind.,Date of stay: August 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D6074QTmichaelh

The personalised service we received from the staff was second to none and nothing was too much trouble for them. The staff were so friendly and genuinely really nice. The hotel owner was frequently present and made the effort to speak to all the guest to ensure everything was okay.    The hotel was just what we were looking for and so much more. This boutique hotel was designed to a top spec and we enjoyed the modern interior throughout. We stayed in the prestige room that had a balcony overlooking the pool and gardens. The room was huge and had a separate hallway to the bathroom. We enjoyed the flatscreen LCD TV that had a decent selection of English channels. Our room was always cleaned to a high standard and a mid evening visit to provide water and petals on the bed made a nice gesture.    The pool and gardens were well maintained and very tranquil. This is a small and intimate hotel and we were able to get to know some of the other guests who were all very pleasant.    The food was great with a good selection for breakfast (buffet). We ate lunch at the hotel most days and occasionally ate dinner here - we enjoyed both the Moroccan and English menus. Very impressed with the chef the food was amazing and very well presented. Other nights we ate at Le Comptoire and Bo Zin both very highly recommended.    Yes the hotel is not in the centre of the medina but that is what we wanted as the free shuttle buses provide a easily accessible service to the main square. We also used a private taxi service with all drivers knowing exactly how to find this hotel.    I don't think there is anything to fault about this hotel - we were very impressed and can't wait to return again.

We went for a weeks relaxation with our 7 year old son and we could not have asked for a nicer break away. We had a Garden room that was right next to the pool and we could pop in and out from the room with ease as though the pool was ours. The hotel is not overcrowded (another plus for me) and the staff are pleasant and always talked to and spoke to our son especially making him feel at home and welcome.    The Hotel is away from the VERY busy town which was perfect for us as well and when we did want to venture in there were 6 buses a day (free).    The food at the hotel was at UK prices so in the evening we could spend ¬£50 for 3 of us (excluding alcohol) however the food was laid out and tasted like high end restaurants. The lunch menu was very reasonable and they did not mind us ordering from this menu in the evening which was an added bonus as in hot climates my appetite seems to dwindle.    All in all we loved this break away and would highly recommend it if you are looking for a little oasis of calm and tranquillity and high end feel.    The only slight downside I could comment on would be the intermittent WiFi access which can make it challenging to keep in touch with family at home. However a quick walk to the hotel reception and the signal is restored.,Date of stay: August 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Wokingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/904jonf

We cannot fault the staff they are wonderful and are really trying hard to please guests. But the hotel itself just gets the basics wrong.    Key things:  - In being 'boutique' the high walls and huge doors actually make the place feel like a prison  - Masses of hair in the bath plug holes  - The jacuzzi and bath taps flush out brown water they have not being cleaned for a long time and its pretty horrible when you first run the water  - Because you are in such a remote location they try and grab money from you wherever possible. Signs everywhere saying guests are strictly forbidden to bring their own food and drink. They then charge 2 euros for water (any 5* hotel I've stayed in provides this for free).  - They found out we were on our honeymoon and just tried to up sell us the whole time (40 euros to put some flowers on our table at dinner!!)  - The restaurant is very average (no fault of the staff just the food) being so remote you only have this one choice to eat.  - Wifi does not work in the rooms    Marrakech has multiple luxury hotels and this one just doesn't match the experience location or beauty of the others.,Date of stay: August 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Toronto, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K1G6H5H

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Suzi S wrote a review Aug 2014,30,Not a great experience.,I stayed here in March with a group of girlfriends having spent 5 days in the Medina.  The outside looks like a prison grey concrete walls not at all inviting.  The staff were very off hand most of the time and unhelpful.  We told the young lady on reception that our balcony door would not close properly and therefore we couldn't lock it. She said it wasn't possible it was the fact that we were not doing it properly!  On the first night we were unable to sleep due to the high winds whistling through the gap in the doors. The noise kept us awake most of the night.  We also told her on the first afternoon that our kettle did not work and neither did our fridge. It was still not working when we checked out 4 days later.  I asked her why it had not been looked at it she said she'd asked someone to do it but they hadn't.  In a 'quality' hotel such as this you would expect it to be done ASAP and to make sure it was put right.  I've stayed in many 4 & 5 star hotels in the world and this hotel in my opinion does not warrant the stars it has.  Needless to say I will not be making a return visit.,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Carcassonne,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/129suzis
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Jane M wrote a review Aug 2014,50,Tranquility at its finest.,On arrival at The Siryane Hotel the first thing I noticed was the peacefulness. It is in a beautiful setting and the gardens are wonderfully kept adding to the tranquility of the hotel. It is in a great location about 20 minutes away from the hustle and bustle of the Medina. There is a hotel shuttle bus into Marrakech which was regular and prompt. We had booked a mini suite with private garden which was spacious and had quick and easy access to the pool each day. The room was presented well; cleaned and towels displayed creatively! The only thing that could be improved upon would be to receive complimentary water daily as buying it in the hotel was expensive in comparison to the supermarkets which were not close by. Customer service was excellent nothing was ever too much trouble. The choice of food at breakfast was extensive and the evening menu had a wide range of Morrocan delights to choose from. We used the Spa 3 times during our 7 night stay and felt the price was reasonable and service very good. We were extremely fortunate to be upgraded on our last night to the Deluxe Suite with private pool and terrace. This room was perfect for those wanting to escape from it all even the other guests! We would definitely recommend this hotel and would without doubt return if we were to go back to Marrakech.,Date of stay: August 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cardiff, Wales, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janemR3582UJ

The food is top quality and fairly priced. The owner after introducing himself does he's upmost to ensure your stay is as comfortable as is expected or if not more. Whilst we were their we popped into some of the highly recommended hotels for drinks and dinner and our thoughts were they were not a patch on this place which was also well worth the money. We would definatley recommend using the spar facilities properley trained staff.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,FoxtrotUk wrote a review Aug 2014,50,"Perfect Oasis, brilliant bolt hole!","First time traveller to Marrakech and long weekending with couples. This is just a perfect spot for chilling fantastic food exceptional service and fun too.    Only 15 minutes from the airport and morning arrival we had to wait a while for our rooms but no worries. Mint tea on arrival and a cold beer with lunch before our rooms were ready was a perfect start to a relaxing weekend.    The lunches are just right fresh fish glorious citron salads and the wines ( whilst a small selection) were all good quality and excellent value. I have paid much more for less at lunchtimes so it was a real treat.    Rooms are all modern and very clean. 5 star. We had a balcony view of the pool which was good and quiet. The garden rooms with little seating area looked good too. Couldn't fault any room at all.    The pool area is great! The double tempur mattress beds are possibly the best I have ever found in a hotel. Pool service pretty good and not in your face. if you need something they will get it. Perhaps as a suggestion they could have different mood music as the same loop became a little annoying after 3 days. But some of our friends didn't even notice it so what do I know!    Some friends used the spa and said that it was brilliant and highly recommended a treatment.    Dinner outside was a great experience. We ate at the hotel twice ( and wished it had been 3 times). The Manager took considerable care in explaining both the Moroccan menu and the International offerings. You could mix and match if you wanted. Every course of each dinner by all our group was greeted with high praise. It's a must if you stay in the hotel of an evening.    Other areas of note the flavour pipes are well presented and serviced and there is a sport room ( telly and pool table) if required. Gym too for running off the glorious dinner and ""Flag Beer"".    The Hotel is about 20 minutes into the City and a private complimentary shuttle bus is very convenient for there and importantly for getting back. Early evening in Marrakech is a sight not to be missed then enjoy the sights smells etc of the main square at night is a must. Once was enough though as we missed our oasis Hotel!    We were given recommendations by the Hotel for evening cocktails and for dinner in the city. The Kosybar ( watching Storks fly at sunset is fun) is the place to be for cocktails and we had a pleasant Dinner ( belly dancers et al) at Le Marrakeshi in the square.    Marrakech is an interesting destination not everyones ""cup of tea"" but made very pleasurable due to a great hotel and moreover first class friendly staff.    Be aware though. The immigration at the airport coming into the country and exiting the country was tiresome. We wasted at least 3 hours in the queues and was not a great deal of fun. When leaving the country make sure you are at the airport in plenty of time. It may have been due to local holidays but they need to sort that out for sure.

The team at the Sirayane go above and beyond in terms of personal care and attention to their guests. The service is faultless and it was especially nice for the hotel owner to touch base with guests to ensure that they we're enjoying their stay. We had the pleasure of booking the Deluxe Suite with a private garden and pool and using the Spa which was amazing! We particularly enjoyed the peacefulness and tranquility of this hotel a world away from the hustle and bustle - somewhere you can properly relax. We would almost definitely consider booking again!

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,ELP1992 wrote a review Aug 2014,50,Stunned! *****,Stayed with a couple of friends in June 2014 and was absolutely stunned. We booked what I considered to be a budget holiday and experienced what was actually some of the best service and accommodation ever. I have stayed in 5 star luxury Secrets brand hotels and also the best Vegas hotels and this was honestly ranked in the same way!    We were able to book the hotel transfer with the hotel via email prior to our arrival which was great and was completely safe and hassle free. I was mostly impressed with the service as the driver was polite and efficient. For those worried about tipping and the expectation from people this was not an issue at all as the driver was more than happy to help with luggage without additional payment/tipping.    On arrival were we given some lovely mint tea in the reception area and escorted to our rooms we were impressed with the room as we had our own private hut outside that was beautifully furnished and clean. We had our own sun loungers in our private garden that led out to the pool as well as the luxuriously comfortable sun beds that were on offer around the 2 pools. The pool service was great as waiters took drink orders and outside towels were provided without even having to ask.    We booked an excursion through the hotel to the Ouzod waterfalls and we were quoted a set price where we were told that the payment was to be given to the driver the driver was great and friendly and upon arrival the the waterfall he introduced us to a man who was our tour guide. The guide tried to increase the price of the trip when he saw us but we managed to challenge this so be careful. The tour was great and an experience that I would recommend the tour guide was so good that we did tip him extra in the end!    Some people are complaining about the free shuttle bus that the hotel offers into the medina I don't understand what negatives can be drawn from this it is a free service that most other hotels do not provide and is so convenient and efficient. It does not take long at all and the guidelines that the hotel offer are exactly what is provided. We stayed out a little later than the shuttle bus runs for so we happily booked the private taxi from the hotel to stay on the safe side and we were happy to be collected by the same driver who took us to the waterfalls.    In terms of food it was amazing! The breakfast was included free and there was a great selection of fresh fruit and pastries along with a few hot meats and eggs. If I remember correctly my friend was able to order an omelette to order which is always nice at hotels. We had lunch and dinner at the hotel quite a few times and enjoyed sampling different dishes with the help and explanations from the waiters.    Our flight was after check out so they extended our room stay for as long as possible before we had to vacate the room (free of charge!) We then left our rooms in reception whilst enjoying our last bit of sun and then we were able to use the spa facilities to shower and freshen up before our flight. I was delighted at this as I was very worried about what we were going to do before our flight but the staff were more than accommodating.    Finally I will mention the owner of the hotel he is very friendly and will always aim to please. He often asked us how our stay was and recommended restaurants to us based on what we wanted we were very pleased with this as as a result of his help we had a fantastic night out. Definitely seek advice from the hotel staff if you need help finding a spot to visit at night.    I never really visit the same place twice but if I did return to Marrakech I would definitely go back here!

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,BenjaminKaye wrote a review Jul 2014,50,A very good hotel,A very good hotel about 15 mins from the airport and about the same to the medina. They have a free shuttle which was flexible and very good.    Breakfast was a good standard excellent breads cake and pastry selection good lunch and very nice Moroccan dishes for dinner.    The pool area is very good great sun loungers (big double beds) and the chap who lays your towels out for you was always very quick appearing from nowhere regularly as we arrived!    The Spa is excellent. We had a wonderful couples traditional Hammam and massage package good value and I can highly recommend both in fact I would go as far to say they are a must if you are staying in the hotel.    We stayed in a garden suite and I can highly recommend them they are well appointed and you walk straight out on to the pool. I did see a balcony room which was perfectly nice as well.    While you are not in the Medina it is only a 10/15 min drive and the cabs were about 100DH each way which I'm sure was overcharging us as tourists but is less than ¬£8 so can live with it to come and go as you please without having a fight over ¬£3 every time you need to get to the pool!    As everyone has said the staff are really very good the restaurant manager and the owner stand out! The owner is on site a great deal of the time he is a charming man and always checking with guests that they are enjoying their stay and everything is going well. He went out of his way to help us with printing some documents I needed and really was friendly and professional as good as you will find anywhere in the world.    When we stayed there were several families with very young children and a few couples.    The cocktails could have been better as could the selection of spirits but for a country that doesn't drink they had a good stab at it!    For the price I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to friends and family for a long weekend in the sun.,Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BenjaminKaye

Breakfast was complimentary (and excellent) and the wide range of lunch and dinner options meant that we were spoilt for choice.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Jayne F wrote a review Jul 2014,50,A little bit of luxury,We stayed for 4 days in July 2014 and had the most wonderful time. There are many wonderful qualities this gem of a hotel has but the best has to be the staff so welcoming friendly and attentive. Always on hand and nothing is too much trouble.    The pool guy is an extra bonus I had not experienced in other hotels running out as soon as he sees you eyeing up a lounger laying out towels (provided by the hotel) and placing the umbrella exactly where you want it. The restaurant and bar staff likewise were also friendly I was so impressed with there professionalism especially as it was Ramadan and they were unable to eat any of the delicious food themselves during the day yet always served us with a smile! As a vegetarian I had concerns about being able to find something on the menu I simply explained my dietary requirements to the restaurant manager and they fixed me up something specially but still keeping a Moroccan theme. The food is some of the best I have ever tasted.    The pool was warm and there were plenty of loungers for everyone it never seemed too busy or loud. The decor inside the hotel has clearly had a lot of time care and attention put into it as it is absolutely beautiful the massive traditional doors to the main areas from the central courtyard were a particularly impressive sight.    The rooms were kept clean and were also beautifully designed the mini-bar was well priced and there were fresh towels put out everyday. We stayed in a suite but I have my eye on one of the rooms with a private garden for next time!    We visited the spa during our stay and had a traditional Hammam the staff were helpful and the treatment was lovely and it helps your tan. The wifi in the hotel was great and I am even writing this review while I wait for the hotel arranged shuttle bus to take us to the airport I said I was writing a nice review to the charming hotel owner as he passed and before we knew it some mint tea and Moroccan pastries appeared as a thank you.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Chet48 wrote a review Jul 2014,40,Great Hotel for Relaxing,I will write this review and try and answer the questions I had before booking:    I would suggest if you haven‚Äôt arranged transport to the hotel to then book it with the hotel (cost is 20 Euros) email them.    It is best to use cash or card when making purchase..find the cash point at the airport and take out what you require or a small amount to get you by. If you ask nicely at the exchange desk they will then exchange a bigger note to small notes to allow you to tip. (Smallest note is 20 dirhams)    Now for the Hotel    The hotel itself is in the middle of no where so don‚Äôt expect any local restaurants or shops. It‚Äôs a very clean and tidy hotel with wonderful sunbeds and a lovely pool. One heated pool and one non -heated.    my room 129 was a good size and had a garden leading to the pool which was very hand if you managed to get a sunbed outside your room. The waiters would often walk around if you wanted to order a drink.    GYM - I was a little disappointed with the gym there was a running machine a bike and cross trainer however i would have liked to have seen more weights. (as there were only 2 dumbbells.)    FOOD - Breakfast was pretty standard and the same everyday..Turkey sausages eggs cereal fruit toast pastries. My wife and I preferred the lunch menu to the main menu. I would say the food was average nothing special with generous portions. I am glad we did not go half board as we only once had more than 2 courses on the dinner menu (not making it worth the money for us) note you also had to book for dinner in advance.    Sports bar - the sports bar is a nice touch with a pool table tv screens and bar and also the option to have shisha. The only comment i would make is the pool table is slightly expensive at 20 dirhams a game.    Shuttle Bus  The shuttle bus was very handy if you wanted to go into town. It runs through out the day but you did have to book the bus in advance noting the time you wanted to leave and return.    STAFF  The staff was all very helpful and more than willing to help they all worked well and aimed to please.  Any meals and drinks orders have a service charge automatically added to this so you do not need to tip the waiters this made it much easier.    In Summary - lovely place away from the town with a 15min ride to town when you want to be a little more adventurous. Great place to get away from it all and relax.,Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Chigwell, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chet48

The staff were fantastic and went out of their way to make our days comfortable. The owner also appeared every day to check we were having a good time.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Simon L wrote a review Jul 2014,50,An oasis,This really is a hidden jewel of an hotel hidden away on the outskirts of Marrakech and within sight of the Atlas Mountains. As a base from which to explore the magic of the surrounding landscape and the wonders of Marrakech the Sirayane offers both a haven of tranquility and a platform from which to explore so much. Don't be put off by the dusty gravel track when turning off the main road or the rather non-descript exterior of the hotel entrance because as soon as you enter you are bound to fall under the relaxing charms of the hotel its laid back and stylishly comfortable charm and its warm and attentive staff. Probably aimed more at romantic couples although still a great place for friends and families the Sirayane is a place to truly unwind in just 15 minutes from the energy and hubbub of the Media and souks of Marrakech. The service and quality are faultless and the staff cannot do enough to help both within the hotel and with sight seeing and organised excursions or activities.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,SimonJ27 wrote a review Jul 2014,50,"Peace and Quiet, Fantastic Service, Supremely Comfortable","My wife and I wanted a hotel that was small enough so that we weren't just another ""face in the crowd"" which is what tends to happen in larger establishments. We wanted somewhere where we could just relax and do very little in luxury or to do nothing at all.  Given that the Sirayane is just 4 years old the owner is to be congratulated in having created a pure Corner of Paradise on the outskirts of such a frenetic busy city as Marrakech.  The whole experience during week-long stay was an absolute pleasure.  Thanks again to the owner who made regular appearances to check that all guest were being looked after well. Free wi-fi in right across the hotel meant that we could stay connected such a service should be standard in all hotels - and in the Sirayane it is!  Special thanks to restaurant manager Anas who is a real character and particularly to Soufiane and Salah whose customer service skills are superb.  Our beautiful room had a lovely mini garden leading out to the beautiful pool area. No worry about sunbeds here - quite the reverse as soon as the staff see you appear they come to organise towels laid out on what must be some of the most luxurious beds we have ever seen - huge soft double mattresses cosset you while the pool staff come to make regular adjustments to umbrellas during the day so if you want to stay under the shade all day you can! Waiter service is at hand all day - you really don't have to lift a finger!  The beautifully landscaped garden areas allow for small birds to accompany you with sweet sounding song.......enchanting.  There is a choice of either sports bar or lounge bar accommodating football fans with 3 large screens during this World Cup year and those who prefer a more relaxed atmosphere watching the sun set on another beautiful Moroccan day.  There are so many clever design features maximising both space and light - our room was both roomy and light - we could even borrow DVDs from the extensive hotel library..  We enjoyed the atmosphere provided by the terrace restaurant where outdoor eating was a real pleasure - good choice of both local and international dishes to compliment some pretty good local Moroccan wines served with a ""don't worry if you can't finish the bottle tonight we'll keep it for you for tomorrow....."" Nothing absolutely nothing was too much trouble!  We only made two brief trips out during the week as we really just wanted to rest but the Sirayane arranged transport seamlessly - our driver Omar was a great character - so helpful and knowledgeable.  Climate in early July was beautiful - warm with a very slight breeze across the pool to keep things comfortable.....  Thanks to everyone at the Sirayane.  Having read other comments on this hotel I can agree that perhaps a couple more English language channels would be nice to have but really not necessary - if you're going to spend all the time in the room then you might as well be anywhere - enjoy the Moroccan atmosphere in a relaxed informal way.  There are a couple of larger rooms with private pools (proper pools not just the plunge type) which would be fine for some but although we wanted peace and quiet we wouldn't take one as we would feel too cut off from the rest of the world - nice to have the option though.....  My wife and I are very well-travelled both on business and holiday. To say that we are looking forward to making a reservation to return to the Sirayane next year speaks volumes.....we really are drawn to the place!",Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SimonJ27
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,arun c wrote a review Jul 2014,40,Tranquility when you need it!!,As this was our fourth visit to Marrakech and a business trip we decided to book a reasonably priced hotel rather than splurge out on the likes of Le Mammounia Taj Palace or the Four Seasons. We were certainly not disappointed by our choice.    The very early flight from Gatwick meant that we were deposited by the private hotel transfer at around 10:30 in the morning. It was disappointing that we were kept waiting until 12:30 before a room was available. Perhaps a courteous gesture on the part of the hotel would have been an offer of a drink while we were waiting for those two and a half hours. However we were provided with the lovely fragrant Moroccan tea on arrival.    Our room was a prestige room with a half board package. The room was comfortable and had a balcony where you could sit and watch the Atlas range in the evenings.    The bathroom was large and particularly handy and ? Romantic was the double shower. It did mean that we did not have to wait until one of us finished showering first particularly helpful when you have a plain to catch or an early morning tour.    The TV was a bit of a disappointment as there were only two English channels. Given that there were a large number of English speaking guests this needs considering by the management.    Milk was not provided in the complimentary tea tray in the room but the staff did some over promptly when requested.    The turn over service was good but had to be requested on three occasions  .  The evening meal provided as a part of our half board was from the a la carte menu and was exceptionally good. It has to be said though that drinks were very expensive. A small bottle of ordinary strength lager was at MAD 770 inclusive of tax. This is around ¬£5.50.    The morning breakfast provided most of all you need but was not extraordinary.    The staff were friendly and keen to please.    The owner/ General manager Mr. Mehdi was in the hotel on most days to make sure that everything was shipshape. He was charming and keen to provide help and advise. He along with his senior management were passionate in extending their hospitality.    This hotel although away from the Medina (which was a blessing) bridged the gap very effectively by providing free transportation.    This hotel had guests widely ranging in age. There were young couple group of friends and families. Thus the hotel is a good choice for honeymooners young and mature couples.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Scunthorpe, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arunc

The Juinior suite we had with private pool and garden was 5 star accommodation at the very least! Clean well furnished and an abundance of space. We slept like logs every night and turned it into a home from home during our stay. The restaurant and staff are first class! We ate well drank fantastic moroccon wines experimented with nearly everything off the menu and enjoyed everything and had no upset tummy's throughout our stay! The regular shuttle bus (free) into Marrakech in a great way to explore the craziness of the medina and soukhs but the relief of returning to the Sirayane and its calm and relaxed atmosphere will never be forgotten.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Sophie P wrote a review Jun 2014,50,A lovely oasis,This is a really nicely-run boutique hotel - and it's a haven from the manic Medina of Marrakech. The free regular shuttle buses mean you can go explore Marrakech anytime but we relished having this peaceful spot to return to when it all got a bit much in the centre of town.  Rooms are tastefully designed spacious and private. The gardens spa and all the peaceful communal areas of the hotel are spotless. The owner personally comes and says hello when you arrive (as you sip a mint tea) and continues to check in with you at discreet moments throughout your stay. The service across the board was very attentive yet gentle.  The food and drink was great value and generous. The breakfast buffet could have had a little more choice or at least change its options now and then as it got a little repetitive.  And a few welcome finishing touches - free WiFi and arranging our airport transfer were really appreciated.  I'd definitely recommend this lovely spot - it's a great combination of laid-back luxury.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SophieP105
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Louise M wrote a review Jun 2014,50,A slice of heaven!,Thank you so much to the owner and the whole team for making our stay the most wonderful experience. Thank you to Soufiane in the bar for your fantastic hospitality and everyone at The Sirayane for making us feel so very welcome and special. Everyone always had time to say hello we saw the owner every day and he always took the time to greet us and ask how we were. From the moment my Sister and I arrived we knew we had struck gold booking this gorgeous hotel. The setting is perfect just ten minutes away from the Medina and the hotel organise a free shuttle service with lovely drivers to and from the Medina which was always prompt and made it hassle free. It is the perfect retreat from the hustle and bustle of the Souks. Our room was gorgeous overlooking the pool with a very comfortable king size bed lovely bathroom with double sinks walk in shower complete with robe and slippers. The room was spotless with soft bed linen and fluffy towels. There was also flat screen TV dvd hair dryer safe tea & coffee making facilities mini bar and air con and balcony. The hotel is stunning with two gorgeous pools surrounded by amazing double beds with pillows to chill out on. As soon as you choose your sunbed a member of the team immediately appears with fresh towels and will position your umbrella for you if needed. The bar staff serve drinks around the pool so you do not lift a finger! The lounge restaurant and bar area is gorgeous serving first class food. The buffet breakfast is lovely with a huge variety to choose from. The Spa is gorgeous and I can personally recommend the Hammam massage as it was amazing. We were so sad to leave yesterday I can honestly say it is a first class hotel with a first class team to ensure you have a fantastic stay. I cannot praise the team enough and I have already recommended it to my friends. I can't wait to return again. Thank you all for our magical Moroccan experience!,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/261louisem

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Lisa G wrote a review Jun 2014,40,"Fabulous, very welcoming hotel",We stayed here for four days for my sister's hen weekend earlier this year in March - wanted something a little more luxurious and less cheesy than Brighton! We had an excellent time and found a beautiful clean and welcoming hotel with a great spa. The service was just fantastic from the owner who helpfully suggested and booked lovely restaurants for us through to the waiters who were all brilliant and went out of their way to help. We had two very rainy days but this didn't matter as we made full use of the spa - wonderfully relaxing treatments with great service. Once we were able to enjoy the sun we relaxed by the pool which was fab. The hotel very helpfully arranged private transport for us which meant we could come and go as we pleased whether it was to the souk/medina or out in the evening to bars and restaurants. As we were a group of 10 this worked out quite reasonably and meant we had no hassle whatsoever. A great hotel made our stay in Marrakech a very enjoyable one. Would highly recommend and would definitely go back. Food in the restaurant esp in the evening was lovely. The lamb tangine was amazing!,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Tring, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisagG3442LL
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,marmarisdreaming wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Luxurious and relaxing,"Absolutely amazing hotel spotlessly clean and glamorous spacious surroundings. The pool is amazing with huge double loungers at the side to sleep on :). The staff all spoke English and were extremely courteous and helpful I was ill whilst I was there and staff were really kind. The breakfasts were delicious freshly made omelettes fresh bread and the most amazing freshly squeezed orange juice. The hotel is a short minibus ride to the square (the hotel provide the minibus and its free reliable and prompt). The atmosphere of the hotel is very welcoming chilled out and relaxed. We were served fresh mint tea and a plate of Moroccan pastries on arrival- which was a nice touch. The rooms are spacious with flat screen TV's and a selection of DVD's and the bedroom looked out onto our own spacious secluded garden for private sunbathing. The bedding was top quality Egyptian cotton and really comfortable. The restaurant food was delicious (although slightly expensive) and the waiters were pleasant and not ""in your face "" all the time (my pet hate).

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Stuh72 wrote a review Jun 2014,40,Excellant Hotel for a relaxing break,"Stayed here with a friend for a week in early June 2014 looking for a relaxing week away from the hustle of the Medina and city and found this hotel to be perfect for our needs. The hotel has a very chilled out relaxed feel to it with attentive staff but not the type that are ""in your face"" all the time if you want something to drink or eat they will get it for you with no fuss or hassle otherwise your left alone to sit by the pool! There are two pools one is heated and perfect for cooling down in or the other which is slightly larger if you fancy a proper swim.    First impressions are that its a hotel for couples on a romantic break however don't let that put you off as it may of just been the type of guests there when we arrived.    Comfortable rooms air conditioning  mini bar and a shower you can see into from the bedroom so if your with a friend make sure the curtain is pulled across!  Food was excellent with plenty of selection either International or Moroccan. Served all day with a buffet breakfast also with plenty of selection.    There is also a separate bar with a pool table and tv screens if you want your fix of sport or tv.    There is nothing near the hotel so you can't go for a walk anywhere but the shuttle bus is frequent and back and forth all day at set times taking you to the city centre takes about 15mins however a taxi would be cheap if you wanted to stay out later than 11pm or go at other times.    One thing to note is the tours booked through the hotel seem expensive compared to others we saw advertised in the city.    As for Marrakech - a very cool city with plenty to see from the Souks to the new town and everything in-between and compared to Egypt the hassling/selling from the shop owners is nowhere near as bad highly recommended for a visit.    Overall if you want a relaxing hotel outside the city but near enough to get there in no time then you can't go wrong with this hotel definately recommended for all ages.",Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stuh72

Whilst the hotel is about 15 minutes outside of the main Medina walls it was a welcome break to come back to after the bustle of the City and the hotel offers numerous free shuttle buses throughout the day to get you there and back. The owner and staff were happy to help with any requests that we had. The breakfast was lovely with seating overlooking the pool and gardens. We had dinner in the hotel on one evening which again was fantastic. The rooms were decorated in a boutique type way as was the rest of the hotel. My only slight critisism was that the small gym which was attached to health and spa part didn't open in the morning until 10am. This did not however spoil my luxury break in any way. The hotel were happy to arrange any taxis excursions and dinner reservations as well as arranging a guide to take us through the City on our first outing to find our feet.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"High Wycombe, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bear19692014

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Paula L wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Perfection,I have just returned home from a 4 night stay at the Sirayane which I had the pleasure of staying at with 5 other ladies to celebrate our 40th birthdays. When we arrived we were greeted by the hotel manager with a cup of mint tea. We were shown to our beautiful rooms which were upgraded with the added bonus of a terraced garden. Everything was catered for including toiletries towelsslippers and a bath robe. There was also a safe mini bar hairdryer and tv/dvd player.  Although we were on a b&b basis we were able to book lunch/dinner on the day when required. The food was of a very high standard with a lot of choice.  The hotel was very comfortable both in the rooms and on the sun loungers it was a very relaxed peaceful environment.  The staff were very attentive to our needs if you went to put the umbrella up they literally ran to do it for you they laid out the towels on sun loungers (supplied by them). Drinks were brought out to you by the pool. The shuttle service to the medina was a 10 minute ride and the airport 15 minutes. Said drove us on a couple of occasions including to the Atlas Mountain and was very informative with an exceptional English vocabulary.  This was my 1st visit to Marrakech and I was pleasantly surprised by the very high standard of service that this hotel offered. We didn't use the spa on this occasion so unable to comment about it.

The pool attendant was so attentive with towels and moving the umbrella for you. If you wanted to eat dinner or lunch at the restaurant you just book a table that day.

The owner and his staff were so welcoming and attentive from the beginning to the end of our stay.  We booked a room with a private garden - very well designed and quite large.  The hotel is a real oasis away from the hustle and bustle of the old city. It's beautifully designed and a very peaceful place to hang out.  Good choice of breakfast and on the one night that we dined at the restaurant that was also good too.  The free shuttle bus was an invaluable addition to the service taking you into the old part of town and bringing you back at set times. It would normally be about 20 Euros (one way) if you got a cab so the savings are quite significant.  My wife enjoyed her Hammam at the Spa very much. The pool is great - the small one is heated and the pool area is very relaxing.  The great thing about this place was the feeling of space and serenity as there aren't too many rooms.  Our thanks to the owner (Mehdi) and all the staff. Looking forward to the next time!

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Jay T wrote a review Jun 2014,50,First Visit to Marrakech,So as the title says for my wife and I it was our first visit to Marrakech and it wasn't disappointing. We wanted a nice spa hotel where we could relax away from the hustle and bustle of the old town. The hotel is situated about 15 mins from the airport and about 15 mins from the main medina.    When we arrived we were warmly greeted by the receptionist and were given mint tea while we waited. Once we checked in we were shown around and were very happy with what we saw. A very contemporary hotel with great design inside and out. A small yet functional gym and 2 outdoor pools (smaller pool is heated). Our room was one with a private garden and was big clean and modern.    Sirayane have a free shuttle bus service running from the morning to the last pick up at 23:15. The drivers are very friendly and always willing to answer any questions you may have especially Said...he was very helpful.    All staff were helpful and we were always made to feel very welcome plus everyone smiled. The spa is very good but you will need to book quite early on (first or second day) in order to get a treatment done as it is busy. We were staying for 6 nights and booked a Hammam for our 5th day on day 1!    The owner of the hotel was there everyday and greeted us and always asked if we were being looked after. I'm sure if we were not he would address this immediately. If we were to come to Marrakech again we would definitely stay at the Sirayane.,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Windsor, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayT275

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Brian A wrote a review May 2014,50,Sirayane Hotel Experience,I have never written a hotel review before but I have travelled the world and stayed in may hotels either on holiday or on business and am writing this review based on the exceptional service which I received during my stay.    The staff are simply marvellous they are attentive without being intrusive as you will read in many of the reports for this hotel the owner and manager are on hand almost every day and make a point of speaking to their customer in a open and friendly manor. If you want for anything they will do all they can to fulfil your wish this is the service upon which 5 star hotels are based and they should be complemented for their attitude to care of the customer.    The dining experience is also wonderful with the exception of other guests cigarette smoke wafting across the table which can't be helped if you chose to stay in that part of the world a former French colony. Having said that I highly recommend the traditional Moroccan menu and local wine the two were made for each other. Well cocked fragrant rather than heavily spicy food is what you receive I especially enjoyed the Moroccan Soup even though we enjoyed a high during our stay of 46 C !!!    The real expression of how good this hotel is to ask myself would I stay there again with so much of the world yet to explore and the answer is yes. We're thinking of returning in January or early February to go skiing in the mornings in the Atlas mountains and to rest by the pool in the afternoon how crazy would that be !!!,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hebden Bridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/159briana
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Staceyc wrote a review May 2014,50,Amazing Place,We have just returned from a 3 night stay at the Sirayane and can honestly say we were blown away. We had booked the Hotel based on the brilliant reviews anyway but you don't always know what to expect however we were not disappointed! From check-in to departure our stay was top notch. The place was spotlessly clean in all areas very well decorated and laid out and had a relaxing atmosphere. Whilst the hotel looked fabulous the real credit to this place is the Staff. Every single member of staff that we came across was so friendly efficient and could not do enough for you; on arrival we received a complimentary traditional tea before being given a tour they kindly took our luggage to the room for us they lay out complimentary towels at the pool for you they also remember you personally. We had booked this Hotel not only on its good reviews but as we were looking for a relaxing break with the spa; we were saddened to find out they were pretty full for treatments however the owner went out of his way to fit us in and we were fortunate enough to enjoy traditional Hammam scrubs (- it was amazing!!!!!) as well as Indian Head massages. We spent most of our time by the pool on the comfy beds enjoyed lunch and 2 out of the 3 evenings relaxed with room service. The hotel has a free shuttle bus into the square which we were very pleased about; we had also chosen here as it is slightly out of town so is a quiet retreat yet not too far from the amazing markets! I just want to say a special thank you to the gentleman on reception (i didn't get his name i'm afraid) as he really helped us out; my luggage was lost and he went out of his way with making phone calls and arranging transport for us so another big thank you!

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,stephcooke38 wrote a review May 2014,50,50th Birthday Celebration,The Sirayane is truely a beautiful Hotel. Surrounded by well manicured gardens with lovely Roses. From the outset we were given a guided tour & made to feel very welcome by Amal the reception Manager I think.  We were given a free upgrade to a room with a private Garden which was beautifully clean & well appointed. Towels were decoratively laid out & sprinkled with Rose Petals lovely.    Our room was very clean & spacious. No Bath but Shower was powerful & big enough for two so no issue there.  The only miner gripe with the room was the fridge. It was barely cold & we had to request an Ice bucket on a couple of occasions as we wanted to toast my Husbands 50th. It was bought to our room very promptly. Our room had a nice flat screen TV & DVD player but only had CNN in English on TV so listened to my CD's when we were in the room.    WiFi was a bit hit & miss but it was generally ok.    Cannot comment on Dinner food or service as we did not eat anything other than Breakfast which was fantastic all tastes catered for. I follow a Vegan High Raw diet & I was very impressed with the variety of Fruit & Vegetable's available for Breakfast. Staff were all helpful & willing to please.    I had a Hammam which was excellent. Spa facilities are very nice & therapist was very professional.  We booked the Ourika Valley tour through the Hotel & enjoyed our day thoroughly. The other main sites can be seen on the open top bus tour which is really good as the ticket lasts 24hrs & you can hop on & off as you like.    The Sirayane is about 15 mins without traffic from the main Jemaa El Fna Square so the shuttle bus is definitely a plus for this Hotel. The booking is straightforward & the service runs to time.  The Hotel has a very tranquil & quiet feel perfect for us as we just wanted a nice couples break. The Pool area is very nice & thankfully it was not overrun with children. The Sports Bar is a nice touch which pleased my Husband as he did not miss out on any matches.  Around the hotel is 400m so I had a lovely run in the Morning & also outside the Hotel to main road. It is a bit isolated but I felt quite safe.  On the day we checked out our luggage was looked after as we had 4hrs till our flight. We relaxed outside & in the Library area & was served complimentary Mint Tea & Biscuits. I felt very looked after at the Sirayane & it was definitely service with a smile.  This was our first time in Marrakech & we will definitely be returning & recommended The Sirayane highly.,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephcooke38
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Jay R wrote a review May 2014,50,Peacful and quiet,This was truly an incredible place to be. It is the total opposite of how Marrakech town is. I preferred staying at the hotel in our private pool for most of week than being in the town. Just to make you aware it is about a 15 minute drive from the hotel but the hotel does provide an excellent shuttle service into town and back at various times. If you do however need to book a taxi through the hotel out of the shuttle times it will cost 20 euros each way which is quite expensive.    The owner of the hotel checked up on us a few times during the week and was a polite and caring person. He always asked if there was anything he can do and always gave us lots of information and did really want us to enjoy our stay.    The waiters probably made the overall experience so much more enjoyable. They were always polite looked after us and were not shy to have conversation with us. They couldn't have done anymore to make our breakfast dinner and lunch more enjoyable. A big thank you to all the waiters who served us delicious food and in great time each day.    Housekeeping attended our room twice a day morning and evening to clean up. They did a great job for us. No complaints with them at all.    There isn't much I can actually fault about the hotel the rooms was absolutely big in our suite the pool was large and cool the staff were amazing. The only thing I can say is the prices are slightly on the high side but being a beautiful hotel you cannot really complain.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Yaw K wrote a review May 2014,40,Loved it!,Stayed here in August 2013 for a week with my girlfried. Absolutely loved it. Hotel has some beautiful grounds which we took every opportunity to take in. We had complimentary Hammam which was extremely pleasant and relaxing. The room was very clean and was cleaned daily along with towel changes. The hotel was very peaceful and relaxing and the staff were very helpful and friendly at all times.  The location is perfect far away enough from the hustle and bustle of the main square but not too far so that the shuttle organised by the hotel took too long.  The only knock was that on one evening there was a mix up with the hotel shuttle that was supposed to bring us back from the main square where they had more people to collect than space and we had to wait for almost an hour for another to be sent. In all fairness to the Sirayane it probably wouldn't have taken so long if not for the traffic caused by the crowds observing Ramadan. Also they took something off our bill when we raised the issue which was much appreciated.  Apart from this everything was totally perfect and we'd absolutely come back here if we were to visit Marrakech.,Date of stay: August 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/808yawk
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,MissPiggyMoo wrote a review May 2014,40,"Lovely, relaxing, nearly 5* but just not quite there",We had a lovely week at the Sirayane during March. The positives are many - a very tranquil location away from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech beautiful interior decor a great spa complimentary transfers to and from Marrakech several times a day pleasant and helpful staff excellent food in the restaurant and a personable owner who was obviously keen to ensure all guests enjoyed their stay. It was everything I would expect from a good 4*. There were just a few issues which detracted and meant I didn't think it reached 5* standard. Those were:    1. The heated swimming pool was very small. The much larger proper pool was unheated and too cold to use whilst we were there. I would like to see both heated.    2. Our room was very clean when we arrived but the standard of daily room cleaning whilst we were there wasn't great. On two occasions I resorted to giving the bathroom a clean myself!    3. Our suite was totally open plan. I would have appreciated a door into the bathroom area or at least a door on the shower cubicle. This would be an improvement both from a privacy perspective and because the shower cubicle was chilly being totally open.    4. The sound insulation between rooms wasn't great. No problem for most nights of our stay as people staying at the Sirayane are generally there for peace and relaxation. However a loud French couple occupied the room next to ours on the last three nights of our holiday and we could clearly hear even their conversations through the walls (and were woken several times).    5. The food we had in the restaurant was of an excellent quality but the menu was quite small - we would have appreciated some more choice and variety.    6. NOTHING complimentary was provided - we didn't even receive bottled water in our room which is unusual.    Overall it was a lovely break and I do recommend the Sirayane.,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissPiggyMoo

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Rachel H wrote a review May 2014,40,Not quite 5*,A warm welcome was awaiting us as was a very contemporary setting and surroundings. Perhaps too much of a nod to style over quality however some elements would benefit from a little updating though not everything.  Great service by the bar and restaurant staff who were very friendly and helpful. The reception staff although helpful were less customer friendly.  Good food both for lunch and dinner along with a good range of drinks prices are what you would expect. The main negative surrounding the dining was the amount of flies around. Fully appreciate it's hot and flies are par for the course but it's not what you want to see every day in the restaurant and on a buffet breakfast.  Rooms were spacious paid for an upgrade for a garden but wouldn't recommend this as not really worth paying for. Cleaning of the rooms left something to be desired particularly poor when there is an influx of ants in the bathroom at all times.  Although out of town the shuttle was really good and reliable with enough times to suit our needs.  May sound like we didn't enjoy ourselves and overall we did but we've stayed in better. Perhaps we were spoilt having just spent 3 nights in a fabulous Riad where the service surroundings and food were second to none!,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"St Helens, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/635rachelh

The service from all the waiters and the pool attendant was the best we have experienced and even the manager and owner came around every day to check that things were ok for us.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,YazzyRaja wrote a review Apr 2014,40,Peace and Tranquility,I chose this hotel based on previous reviews and was not disappointed. This hotel is situated around 3 miles from the city. I went here for a short break with my wife and daughter aged 2. Upon arrival and entering the hotel grounds a huge door opened up and we was greeted by the manager. We were offered a traditional Moroccan tea and our bags taken to our room. Our room ( number 104) had an amazing pool side view with the mountains on the horizon. The room was modern and had a romantic feeling. We had a rose petal on our bed which was a nice touch. The cleaner cleaned our room twice a day and on one occasion it was cleaned in our absence even though we left a 'do not disturb' sign hung on the door. The breakfast was your usual but without hash browns and baked beans. We had an omlette every morning which was superb. There was two pools one slightly warmer than the other and perfect for my young daughter. It was extremely quiet near the pool side as there were not any other children. Majority of the guests were couples only. The hotel had a small gym with the basics and had a spa which in my opinion was expensive. It was approximately ¬£90 per person for a couple of treatments. The hotel did not have a steam room or sauna. It had a sports bar and a pool table. One game of pool cost around ¬£1.50. I decided on breakfast only and had lunch and dinner at the medina so can't comment on the food although a sandwich would cost you in the region of ¬£7. The shuttle to and from the hotel was efficient and punctual with around 5 trips to the medina a day. If you do go to the city via taxi then you should pay no more than 100 dirhams (around ¬£7.50). We decided to book a private taxi booked online (holiday UFO) in advance for our transfers. The cost of this to and from the airport was ¬£28 whereas the hotel was charging 40 euros for the same service. I would definitely recommend using holiday UFO for your transfers.  On one occasion we requested milk for my daughter and this was brought to our room straight away without any additional cost. If you are looking for a peaceful romantic getaway then this is the perfect place. Bear in mind the tours run by the hotel are expensive. A tour booked via the hotel would cost you nearly twice as much then if booked via Thompson.  I would score this hotel 4 and a half out of five.,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YazzyQasam
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,The Rambling Wino wrote a review Apr 2014,50,A sanctuary from the beautiful madness of the Medina,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for five nights over the Easter holiday. This little hotel truly became our relaxing sanctuary and place to forget about work and everything at home.    An interesting observation that made it a little more relaxing was that this was not a ""locals"" spot. Everyone at the hotel was from western countries; American French Spanish Belgian etc. It made it so that as a woman I felt comfortable wearing my normal above the knee strapped dresses laying in my swimming suit etc. Also I heard the staff speak Spanish French and English which made me feel that they really are trying to accommodate to the needs of their customers.    We took in as much as the sun as we could. This involved drinking by the pool during the day enjoying an outside lunch and resting before taking a late afternoon/evening shuttle into the Medina to experience the wonderful intensity of the streets of Marrakesh.    Shuttle Service.  The shuttle service was really prompt and the 10 minute drive in was no issue for us at all. The shuttle dropped and picked you up right at the main square. I would have liked more shuttle times but the times they did have were not difficult to work around. One note: The local taxi cab drivers know the shuttle and they will tell you that it has left. It will not leave without you.    Restaurant:  We had several lunches at the restaurants and we ate dinner at the restaurant twice and it was lovely both evenings but we agreed that we couldn't have had dinner in the restaurant every night. I've read other reviews where they thought the alcohol was expensive. We found that if you stick to wine or beer it is reasonably priced.    Service:  Everything you read is true the service is incredible. From the moment you arrive you feel welcome. You are given mint tea they carry your bags etc. The owner truly cares about the people who are staying in the hotel and if you are around he will greet you every day to see how you are doing. The rooms are nice and clean. The maid staff makes little arrangements with the bed sheets and leaves your roses. I thought that was a sweet touch. It was always nice to come back in the evening after being in the Medina to see what beautiful bed-art awaited me.    The Pool:  The pool area is well sized for the hotel and is surrounded by comfy beds not loungers to relax on. For a couple this was perfect because you could really lay side by side and enjoying relaxing together in the same space. There are actually two pools the cold pool and the warm pool. During our trip most of the people spent their time in the warm pool. I kind of wished there was a Jacuzzi but you can't have it all. There are only two downsides to the pool. One although they serve drinks they don't serve lunch or snacks so if you want to eat you have to go up to the restaurant. I love eating by the pool (it really reminds me that I'm on holiday) so I missed that. Also the pool area is perfectly sized but it seems extra small when poorly behaved children are running around without supervision splashing everyone who is laying near the pool. This isn't a sign at all of the wonderful staff or hotel but just an unfortunate consequence for staying at a more boutique hotel with some less than considerate guests.    As a final note if I could give more than five I would. I absolutely loved staying here!",Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theramblingwino
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,JCR6600 wrote a review Apr 2014,50,"Excellent relaxing hotel, good base for exploring Marrakech and surroundings",My wife and I spent a relaxing 10-night stay (4th-14th April 2014) at the Sirayane Boutique Hotel and Spa. From the warm welcome and mint tea on arrival to our final goodbyes we were treated with exemplary service and courtesy throughout our stay. The hotel's design decor and ambience lived up to the previous reviews and our expectations and the staff are very professional and made our stay a complete delight. This is an excellent hotel for those looking for a relaxing location but close enough to Marrakech and the Atlas Mountains (of which you get an excellent view from the restaurant and bar especially as they were still snow-covered) to satisfy the explorer and sightseer. The pools are excellent and serviced by attendants who provided fresh towels and even went to the extent of adjusting the parasols as the sun moved around to provide then relevant shade on the comfortable sun beds. The exercise room in the spa contains a good mix of apparatus exercise weights steps etc.We would highly recommend the Sirayane to couples and as the school Easter holidays approached there was an increase in families with young children all enjoying themselves in the refreshing and safe heated and cool pools especially as the temperatures were in the high 30's for most of our stay. We booked half-board and the food in the restaurant provided a good variety and quality. The Sports Bar also has a very impressive array of satellite channels so those wishing to keep up to date with their favourite sporting events whilst on holiday are very well catered for too. Our room was a Prestige Room and had its own private garden area with seating and sun loungers. As we had a late departure we were also allocated a temporary room at the end of our final day.,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bridgnorth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JCR6600

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Yogamad1 wrote a review Apr 2014,50,Heartily recommend,The danger with places that score rave reviews is that they sometimes fail to live up to the high expectations you have as a result. Not so with the Sirayane. This really is a little gem. I thought it was the perfect size - large enough to boast good facilities small enough to feel calm and intimate. The pool is the perfect size for a decent swim. The path around the rooms is about 300m so you easily use it as a jogging track for a couple of miles in the early morning cool. That's how I justified copious pancakes at breakfast (there are at least 3 different sorts!)    The restaurant caters for vegetarians - they're happy to tweak the menu for you so just ask. There are veggie versions of the tagine and the couscous that aren't listed on the menu and they will knock you up a decent veggie salad for lunch.    The owner is a lovely guy. The drivers pool man porters and restaurant staff are all very helpful. The night receptionist made us orange juice coffee yoghurt and cake at 5am for our departure.    After the madness of the medina it's lovely to wake up to the birdsong at the Sirayane. We thought it was the perfect complement to the bustle of the city and as others have said the shuttle works well. We got a couple of taxis - once when we came back in the early hours of the morning and once when we missed the shuttle because my husband's watch broke (no we didn't buy it in Marrakech!). We paid 150 MAD each time. I expect you could bargain harder and get it a little cheaper if you were more skilled than us.    All in all I thought it was excellent value for money and I expect we paid at the highest end of its room prices as we were there over the peak Easter week.,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yogamad1

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Tony O wrote a review Apr 2014,50,You must read this before booking...,May I begin by saying; 'I have never written a review before this one!'    My wife and I arrived at the Sirayane Hotel (about a 10 minute drive from the Medina) walked through two large beautiful wooden doors and were greeted by a warm friendly gentleman who asked us to be seated in the lobby whilst he quickly processed the paperwork. Within minutes we were brought hot mint tea (which was served everywhere we went and is known as Moroccan Whiskey).    As soon as our tea arrived we were further greeted by a tall mild-mannered gentleman who introduced himself as the 'owner' of the Hotel. Our paperwork was quickly processed and we were on our way to room 107 which overlooks the pool and has easy access to the; restaurant bar lounge area gym sauna and of course the pool.    I am a former professional athlete have owned a global company and have spent many nights in Hotels. In addition my wife and I have visited many countries and have enjoyed ourselves each time. HOWEVER our stay in the Sirayane was absolutely fantastic. Thanks to the owner's attention to detail the staff's willingness to assist and a Restaurant/Bar Manager who is second to none we did not want for anything. Together the owner and Restaurant/Bar Manager have created the right synergy for guests to enjoy their stay at the Sirayane. Very well done guys!    Our menu was thoroughly explained each meal was superb (I suggest eating in the Hotel) and the ambiance was minimal but comfortable.    If a 'deep-tissue massage' is your fancy you may want to ask for a 'young woman from Senegal' (I am told I cannot use names on this site). Simply wonderful!    The Sauna is relaxing and clean. However if you are a 'workout fanatic' like I am you might find the gym a little weak. There are enough cardio machines for you to work up a sweat but virtually no weights. Then again this is nothing to complain about - I'm just telling it like it is.    To sum it all up the owner runs his business like everyone company should be run. He makes sure his guests are happy and satisfied he knows what is going on in the Hotel (he knew my wife and I had booked a message and asked us that night if we had enjoyed it) he is present each day to speak to each guest he follows up and follows through provides a quality product and service and he employs the best people for the job! What more can you ask for? I wish more companies were run this way...    You must know that I have stayed in more expensive Hotels than the Sirayane which have expensive decor and employees who are dressed in high-priced uniforms. However for the money the Sirayane provides all that you will need to enjoy your stay in Marrakech.    In conclusion I have previously mentioned that 'I am telling it like it is.' I would not be totally truthful if I did not mention the only hiccup we had whilst at the Sirayane. My wife and I had booked a tour through the Hotel and were told the cost of the tour would be on our Hotel bill. When we checked out we found that the cost of the tour was in fact 'not charged to our room' and that we would have to pay the driver who was taking us to the airport. Confusion? A breakdown in communication? Possibly. Then again I am quite certain the Sirayane owner will not allow this to happen ever again. Why? Because he is dedicated to providing the best service available. touche'    Thank you Sirayane for treating us like family and for assisting in making our holiday a complete success. We hope to see you again soon Insha'Allah....    T and L,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonyo983
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Bec A wrote a review Apr 2014,40,Nice hotel,We stayed in the villa with the private pool. The room was nice and the pool was great. The overall service on the hotel was impressive with the owner and manager checking in almost daily when at breakfast or otherwise to ensure everything was ok. The hotel facilities were good with a tennis court spa gym sports bar restaurant etc. so overall an enjoyable stay (although not particularly cheap). The hotel is located a bit out of town which we preferred to get away from the medina but they have a great bus service that is free to take you in and out of town so we didn't need to catch a taxi the whole time we were there. The only negative were the arranged tours we did through the hotel. The guide for the tour of the medina didn't really tell us anything about the culture history etc and whilst he showed us around the maze of streets he just dropped us off at museums and stood outside chatting to his friends (we saw a number of other guides taking people around and explaining the artwork as they didn't have English explanations). He then took us to this restaurant for lunch that was so ridiculously overpriced and a clear tourist trap (twice as much as our dinner at the hotel the night before which included a bottle of wine). I suspect we would have gotten better service from him had we bought a rug from his friend! The second tour we did was to the Atlas Mountains. The guide provided didn't really speak English - very basic conversational levels. So again we asked questions about where we were etc and he couldn't understand or articulate the response. There was another guide that met us half way and took us to the waterfall etc. his English was good and this part of the tour was ok. We unintentionally under tipped him and when our original guide made us aware we gave more. However at the end of the tour we gave a decent tip to the original tour guide (who literally just drove us there and didn't really do much else and who finished the tour 2 hours earlier than it should of!) and he looked at us like he was utterly disappointed. This might be a standard experience but given we booked through the hotel we expected a but more from the tours. Otherwise a nice stay.,Date of stay: March 2014,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bexter1008

The price was very reasonable indeed our villa was huge with 2 extremely comfortable beds our own small private garden and free wifi the toiletries were plentiful and we had our own brew facilities and a small fridge with soft drinks. it rained the first 2 days but we were had a large tv and although no english channels we borrowed 2 dvd's for the 2 rainy nights from reception.    The swimming pools are clean and quite large there is lots of room around you and the poolside beds are comfortable the poolboy brings you large soft dry towels.  The buffet breakfast has so much choice that it would be almost impossible not to find something you like and all the food and fruit was fresh.  The restaurant is fantastic excellent quality food served by excellent waiters. I cannot praise the friendliness enough from the 2 young ladies who made up our room every day all the waiters and reception staff  the spa staff were perfect making you feel totally relaxed and carefree and even the owner came to see us every day to ask if we had everything we needed (which we always did). transport into town and back was frequent and free.    Marrakech itself is very busy hectic and in your face lots of tourists so lots of people wanting your money so the Sirayane was a perfect escape from the madness.

We had no experience of Morrocco before this. The hotel is nicely situated in a quiet location about twenty minutes by shuttle bus from the busy Place Jema al Fna - the main square of the Marrakech medina. The owner and his staff made us very welcome. the menu was very good and presented a fair range of Morroccan recipes and the place was spotlessly clean. The free shuttle bus provided an excellent service linking hotel to city and we used it twice most days. The place was ideal for us - a couple - used to taking their children on holiday in the past - now holidaying alone and looking for a mixture of peace and quiet and adventure. Access to the Atlas Mountains was simple and something not to miss. Altogether a very enjoyable experience . Only one thing we would request run the shuttle bus from the city centre to the hotel at about 7.30pm to facilitate those wishing to have some happy hour drinks down in the town and come back for the evening meal and bar in the hotel .,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andy772

We had a room suite with its own small garden by the pool again impeccable taste in its design. Staff are polite friendly and attentive. There are a few things it should be aware of that would take it up to a 5 rating however.  The location is in the middle of nowhere which is in itself not a problem as the hotel has pretty much all you need and runs a free shuttle service into town around 6 times a day. But they charge 20 Euro to take you to the airport (when it shouldn't cost more than 10 very maximum) and when you ask to call a cab rather then use their car they are unable to provide a taxi number‚Ä¶.  The restaurant's food is great but the menu doesn't change so after the 4th night you do feel a little bored. Moreover I had advised them well in advance that I was gluten free and whilst the manager seemed well informed as to which meals I could eat no substitutes were offered. This meant my menu choices were more limited. When you are at the expensive end of the spectrum I expect substitutes not omissions (unless discounts are offered in place). This also meant I was unable to eat half of the breakfast options. The waiting staff are not educated on what gluten is either so would frequently give me bread or ask half way though my meal if almonds were ok for example‚Ä¶.  It would do well to have a small shop to buy water select snacks and some bits and bobs like suncream or even some trinkets.  The rooms were cleaned well twice daily.

After a lot of research we wanted to have great facilities outside of the busy Town. This place is a real find - only 28 rooms and low rise buildings. The Architectural design of this Hotel is simply beautiful. The Owner The Restaurant Manager and all the Staff were so helpful and nothing too much trouble. We ate in the Hotel several times and everything was top notch - beautifully presented and a good choice. The buffet breakfasts were a lovely start to the day sat outside in immaculate tended grounds with the snow capped Atlas mountains viewed in front.The service is unobtrusive and so polite. The facilities here were great for us. After sightseeing we could return to tranquility and play tennis swim in either a heated pool or larger unheated one. The staff round the pool organise your large double sunbeds and place towels for you. After dinner we often enjoyed a few drinks in the new Sports Bar where pool can be played with a background of sports relayed on large screen or music - great for the younger of our party.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,TimNG wrote a review Mar 2014,40,Relaxing contemporary boutique hotel,"We stayed here during the last week of February which was beautifully sunny and we spent a long days by the pool.    We had a lovely bedroom (mini suite) with exemplary room service and direct access to the pool.    The pool area is luxurious not crowded and the grounds are beautifully landscaped with views of the Atlas mountains.    The manager and staff are very attentive and friendly as if this was their own home nothing was too much trouble and there is no ""corporate"" feel about it.    We enjoyed late breakfasts sitting outside offering everything you could want including omelettes to order.    The shuttle bus to town ran regularly and on time. About 20 mins drive.    We loved the modern architecture and interior design which has a cool vibe probably not suited to those looking for an old fashioned experience but very distinctive and attractive to us.    We will be coming back next year.",Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TimNG

We had a mini-suite that was of an adequate size had all the usual facilities and direct access to the pool. The site is quite large and well laid so that with a low count of guests one gets the impression of pampered luxury! The staff are extremely efficient courteous and helpful. The restaurant is good; breakfast has all the options that you could wish for and the evening meal is very good but the menu is limited. The only downside is that the hotel is isolated although an efficient shuttle service is provided to the main Djemma Square but you do have a quiet and relaxed boutique hotel.,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Great Malvern, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DerekP169

Having enjoyed being in the bustle of the old town it was a lovely change to come to this out-of-town oasis. The hotel itself is a short shuttle ride from the main Djemma Square and provides an idyllic view of the Atlas Mountains. The room was large comfortable and stylish; providing all you would expect from a 5 star hotel.  We enjoyed the heated pool and poolside loungers allowing a tranquil day by the pool. The food was very tasty and the breakfast buffet had plenty of variety.  Staff were very attentive and were accommodating for booking last minute taxis.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Angela wrote a review Feb 2014,50,Relax and Enjoy,"We absolutely loved our stay here. We were coming from staying in a riad the previous nights in the heart of the medina so it was a much needed warm and calming welcome from the staff and the owner upon our arrival. Once we were given the tour of the resort and the endless facilities we were shown our rooms where much to our surprise we had been upgraded to the mini suites with the private gardens. The rooms were lovely and were cleaned daily by the friendly and hardworking housekeepers. In terms of the rooms with our private garden although they were very nice and we had a lot of privacy during our stay I cant help but feel that it would also be nice to stay within the hotel building as that is where the best views of the mountains are which was the reasoning for my original booking.  As I was travelling in a group of 5 with my siblings and parents I must also note that at times it did get rather awkward when having to shower as there is no door inside the suites for the bathroom or shower. On another note we were there the week of Valentines so take into account that it can also be perceived as a couples retreat.  The breakfast had almost everything you could think of and possibly more. It was one of my favourite parts! There was so much variety even the pickiest of people could not fault it.  In terms of the location it is a bit out of the way from the medina so take full advantage of the free bus shuttle. It is a very good service and arrived on the dot each time.  Though this is not a fault of the hotel - please be aware that when being dropped off at the square there will be men waiting by the taxi saying that they are from Sirayane and they are your guide. We had fallen for our ""tour guide from sirayane"" on the soul purpose that he was standing in earshot (right next to) our shuttle bus driver; a few minutes later we were taken to the worst restaurant and charged an extortionate price that you would not think to pay even in london restaurants.  Not many hotels (or any?) have a shuttle service which is why they know the name of Sirayane and from after our own experience we saw men waiting and trying their luck with others getting off the bus.  However this is not the fault of the hotel and we had the most wonderful stay there. I only wish we had stayed there longer and took more advantage of it all. The staff are so friendly and lovely to talk to. I dont think it is possible to not enjoy your stay at Sirayane.",Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/panukla

We couldn't fault the standard of service here....I thought the personal attention the owner gave to his guests was impressive. The service was very friendly attentive and nothing seemed too much trouble. We had a very warm welcome which was lovely after a long journey. The staff mostly spoke English which helped as to our shame we don't speak much French....so language was not an issue. Generally there was just the right balance of attentiveness without being anyone being intrusive.  The Spa was fabulous with a wonderful steam room..I can recommend the hamman!  Food at this hotel was excellent..there is obviously a proper chef here..a nice mix on the menu although we weren't all inclusive we ate here a lot!...and rooms were very stylish and comfortable....great firm mattresses very clean with a good shower. We had a complimentary upgrade to a premium room with its own garden opening out to the pool.  The pools (one is heated) are very well maintained and surrounded by comfy lounge beds with a pool attendant to put towels out for you....this was a very relaxing place to be after the madness of the Medina!  The only slight down side was the fact that we were a bit of a way out from the city..but for us this also felt like a bit of a plus as we could only tolerate a few hours at a time in the Souks and the square! There is a very efficient regular free shuttle bus in and out anyway. But if you like to be in the thick of things all the time it could be a bit of an issue.  Generally I though this hotel was excellent value for money as the standard is so high.

The owner is always around and he makes sure that everything is good during your stay.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,DavidG_8 wrote a review Feb 2014,50,Our second visit,Folks; this hotel is not cheap see the prices on other reviews below if you want cheaper go for a Riad downtown. We suggest you make good use of the 'duty free' shop at your UK airport if you undersand me. I won't dwell on the excellent facilities they are also well reported here. This place is for warm sunshine in a quiet peaceful location usually no kids around with comfortable rooms and spa etc my wife even used the gym this year I preferred to laze on the double sun bed by the pool. The staff keep out of your way but when needed will quickly assist in carrying bags or fetching a drink! Our French improved daily but we communicated in English and the odd 'Inshallah' etc is fun. This was our second year here at the same time having a room upstairs in comparison to last year when we had a villa. We didn't notice any difference except in price well-arranged by Fleetway Travel. The temperature dropped at night especially on our first night we wore fleeces at dinner instead of a dj (only joking). Thereafter the temp climbed daily and we enjoyed the large wood fire in the lounge area with (free) wi-fi. We fully intend to return next year for the same reason - peace and sunshine with a marvellous view of the mountains. We had another look at Marrakech just ok to endure the hassle did a mini pub crawl even gatecrashing into the La Mamounia (posh hotel - google it) for tea and beer on the back terrace an amazing place and worth the cost of the drinks (not too bad). My bottle of beer was poured as if it was a bottle of Moet! Finally we can recommend an 'away-day' up to the Imlil area in the Atlas mountains for a half days walk and a lunch in a spot which has a 5-Star Wow factor. I wont spoil the surprise. We went independent via atlasmorocco.co.uk although the hotel can organise a trip for you which is slightly more expensive. Atlasmorocco have outstanding reviews elsewhere on TripAdv (I have writtten one) A stay in the Sirayane and a visit to the mountains with Atlas compliment each other so we just have to give them a mention.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,brighouse55 wrote a review Feb 2014,40,Nice - not great but nice,Will this winter ever end? No we didn‚Äôt think so either so decided that if the sun wouldn‚Äôt come to us we must head for the sun with the added imperative that Mrs B was facing (or rather cowering in a corner emitting low moans of ‚Äúno it can‚Äôt be‚Äù) a rather substantive birthday off we went to Marrakesh. Now we have never been before and I have to say that some of the stories were quite worrying but we decided to give it a whirl.  Before talking about the hotel just a couple of things on the town and souk. First it is expensive bordering on very expensive nothing like the prices you would expect to pay in say Egypt. We went to the souk twice and the first time was better; it was Friday morning and about half the place was closed but those there were very friendly and not at all pushy. The quality of the products seemed very good and I quite enjoyed the way we were treated. We went back on a Saturday and it was completely different; hard sell and rather obnoxious just as you hear/read about. Also you will get lost in the souk and it is no good trying to spot a road sign (non-existent) or minaret the streets are so close to walls you can‚Äôt see anything 20 feet away.  So to the hotel; very nice and well out of the madness that is the centre. This is a good and bad thing; good in that you can relax around a nice big pool (even in February) and the quiet is most welcome. Bad because it is well out (about 10K) of the town centre and if you miss the regular and free shuttle bus (which we did twice) taxis are loathe to come out that far and if you can get one it costs between 100 and 150dhm (about ¬£12) after knocking them back from 200. We thought taxis over all were very very expensive and not good.  The rooms in the hotel were sort of designer light ‚Äì all polished concrete and modern fixtures and fittings. You could have been in any modern French owned hotel anywhere which was rather sad really ‚Äì especially as the outside promised so much. Wonderful bed with great pillows and the room also had a TV and DVD player which we never switched on. The curtains were blackout ones and the view from our room of the Atlas Mountains was superb. Then you get the stupid bathroom. It had a great shower with huge shower head but a design feature was to have a cut-out in the wall between bedroom and bathroom. Add a glass shower door and an opaque window in the shower room and every morning light would cascade through at about 6.15 right onto our bed. On the positive side this meant we got to breakfast early and it was always good albeit standard hotel buffet stuff.  Again on the plus side the place was spotless good amenity pack in the bathroom and the towels were fluffy and numerous. We thought the staff lacked a bit of personality and they were far happier conversing in French than English but they were all attentive without being subservient and it was nice to see the owner around the place on a regular basis.  But it was expensive; beer was between 40 and 60 for a bottle so as a previous reviewer mentioned ¬£12 a pint. Water was ¬£2.50 a bottle and you would be lucky to get out of the dining room for less than ¬£30 a head and while the food was always good it wasn‚Äôt that good. As I have mentioned in other reviews value for money isn‚Äôt about low cost; a meal at Alain Ducasse might cost ¬£60 a head but if it‚Äôs the best food you have ever eaten its good value for money. This place just wasn‚Äôt and while I can agree with most of the comments made by other reviewers on the plus points of the Sirayana it isn‚Äôt worth 5 stars and the negatives seriously compromise the positives. If trip advisor did half stars I would have given it 3.5 as they don‚Äôt it gets 4 stars as it certainly deserves more than 3. Would we go back ‚Äì nope but the world is a big place and time ticks by so it would have to be really special to get us back and this just wasn‚Äôt. It wasn‚Äôt bad at all and please do give it a try just don‚Äôt expect it to be as good as some of the reviews suggest and do take lots of money!,Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brighouse55
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,mas_shepherd wrote a review Feb 2014,50,Our review of our trip to Marrakech,We have just come back from our trip to Marrakech. Whilst we thought we had a bagged ourselves a bargain in the British Airways sale (which we clearly did not) we still managed to have a relaxing time away from the stress and flooding in England.    The hotel was chosen based on trip adviser reviews and the bargain price we got it through BA.    The staff were fantastic very diligent polite and welcoming. It was nice to meet the owner and be greeted in a friendly and welcoming manner. The food was pleasant and the environment clean and tidy.    Marrakech itself proved very disappointing it felt like everyone there was there to rip you off. It was far too busy and felt unsafe. We booked the hotel shuttle in to the centre which we thought (naively) would enable us to find a reputable guide or find our own way around. Upon arrival the driver dropped us in a very busy place (I had to get out into a main road ) and said he would pick us up at the time we had chosen to return. (In fairness he did do that) However where he had dropped us was easy prey for beggers 'official' guides and other people who were milling around watching our every move.  We were approached by an 'official guide' who I checked had the badge on to say this. Once I had read it I noted he had turned it around later on and then realised it was probably a fake. After taking us down a maze of paths we were shoved into a pharmacy to be given the hard sell on some oil which felt extremely intimidating and unsafe. I got up and said I was leaving as I felt unwell and the man 'selling' was not happy. There seemed a lot of 'divide and seperate' going on which is what happened again when we were frog marched to another place where we were told we were going to see how the carpets were made. Again I told our guide I did not like shopping or being in enclosed spaces but he just ignored me. My husband then stepped in and said we needed to leave the shops as I didn't like shopping but our guide still carried on marching us through the mazes. When we returned to the main square he demanded 200dhms for his work. We were too frightened not to pay so we did leaving us not much for the rest of the day.    My advice would be - yes stay in Marrakech if you like this sort of holiday. For us it was a bit of a culture shock and felt very unsafe. The hotel was amazing we had a lovely time lazing by pool and enjoying the sunshine. The trip would have been better if it had been an all inclusive and with hindsight that is what we will book in future trips abroad. We didn't have enough money to enjoy the place properly. This is no fault of the hotel just us being na√Øve. 270dhms for a dinner is fine but we had only 400dhm (approx. ¬£40) per day each so we struggled to be able to purchase enough bottled water (25dhms a bottle) and didn't bother with alchohol after the 1st night as it was 60dhms for a bottle of Heineken. (as this worked out to ¬£12 a pint it was a no brainer)    Just a final point - use ALL your money before returning to the airport. The local shops will take them but the duty free places refuse. Everything you read about airport security at Marrakech airport is totally true. Just suck it up and wait for it to be over then it's ok.

The design of the hotel blew us away as it is quite modern but has lots of touches of Marrakech within it. The hotel manager greeted us everyday during our stay asking how we were finding our stay which we thought was a very good touch. On my birthday my partner and I were given a glass of champagne with our lunch again a very nice touch and very thoughtful. The hotel is about 15 min drive away from the main square and they provide a shuttle bus to take you there yes it's not always convenient as you are reliant upon the bus to get you to and from the hotel but it's the only way to get there without paying a high taxi fare. This hotel is for those who want peace and quiet as it is a small hotel away from the hustle and bustle of the main city. We were lucky enough to have room 106 which has views of the Atlas Mountains which are amazing. I also used the spa area and had a massage which was also excellent.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,bigmacStA wrote a review Jan 2014,50,Really good with terrific staff,Long weekend in Marrakech at this hotel on a good deal from Expedia. We chose the hotel because of the tripadvisor reviews and were not disappointed.    The shuttle was waiting for us at the airport as arranged through the hotel in advance.    Arriving at the hotel is a bit of a culture shock - it is in the middle of nowhere about 15 to 20 minutes from Marrakech in a complete wasteland. Be aware that there is absolutely nothing that you can access without transport.    The hotel itself is in a walled compound with excellent security [although I saw nothing that made me think security was necessary].    Mint tea on arrival whilst check-in formalities were completed. Then a comprehensive tour of the hotel whilst our bags were taken to our room.    We had a mini-suite with private garden opening on to the pool area. I doubt that it would be five star in London but for Africa it was exceptionally well appointed. Large bed [slightly firm] separate seating area with settee large screen TV and DVD player. [Library of DVDs in reception.] Separate dressing area loo and shower. All clean and effective.    Two pools - one heated [quite small] and a larger unheated one [to be avoided in January]. We thoroughly recommend the double loungers - a really nice idea.    We eat in the hotel and were very happy with the food and service less so with the Moroccan wine [drinkable but not great]. Be aware that the shoulder of lamb for two is simply huge.    We used the hotel shuttle to go into Marrakech. It was on time both ways every time and drops you bang in the middle of town.    The hotel spa was excellent and not too expensive.    The staff were uniformly excellent - attentive without being a nuisance. The regular checks on our wellbeing by the ever-present owner were a nice reassuring touch.    We got a late check-out [until 3 p.m.] without difficulty or fuss [and at no charge].    All in all an excellent hotel with good facilities and a good standard of accommodation.    Our only regret is that we didn't have time to visit the Atlas Mountains which look very inviting from the hotel grounds. If we go back to visit them we will stay at this hotel,Date of stay: January 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"St. Albans, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bigmacStA

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,William W wrote a review Jan 2014,50,"Calm, relaxing and very friendly",We went on a 9 days holiday to rest and get some sunshine. We like design led hotels. The polished rustic concrete walls are very relaxing in this minimal by well designed hotel layout. The choice of garden room or room in hotel do not matter too much as the layout of the hotel is small and everything is just a short walk away. A cold swimming poor and a heated swimming pool are a great attraction for a hot climate. We used the Spa too the treatments are nice and the hot Turkish style massage we had very rewarding.  The hotel offers a free mini-van shuttle service that runs regularly into Marrakesh centre. Being away from the main city by 10 minutes is actually great because there is little of no noise at night. This is what is needed for your holiday right.  Top Tip: The heater/air conditioning unit in each room has a blue display which glows all night like an alien space ship on the remote control there is a button to turn this blue screen off this makes the horrible blue light go away. it would be great if the hotel staff introduced this idea to you when they show you around your room.    5 Stars we loved our stay there thank you to Mehdi and the all the staff,Date of stay: December 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Stratford-upon-Avon, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamwZ6536FY
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Carol M wrote a review Jan 2014,50,Tranquil and oh so relaxing,This immaculate hotel felt like a 'retreat'. If you are looking for complete relaxation in a well-presented boutique hotel away from the hurly burly of Marrakesh then you are likely to enjoy this hotel. It combines the opportunity to explore the city and get away from it all.  The hotel is low rise (mostly single story) set around two very good pools (one heated) which are surrounded by a well kept garden. The double bed size lounge beds around the pool (enough for all guests) were very comfortable suiting the relaxed feel of the hotel. We had a very spacious one-bedroom suite with own garden and seating - this was fab.  Fixtures and facilities around the hotel were of a high standard. The staff were friendly efficient and attentive. The owner of the Hotel introduced himself and from time to time he would check with the guests if all was well. This was a lovely touch and the fact that the staff seemed to be very happy in their work added to our sense of well being.  We stayed four nights and ate at the hotel restaurant on two nights (trying both the standard and gourmet menus) - the food was generally very good and well presented the service was spot on.    That the hotel is in an isolated position approximately 6 miles from Marrakesh centre was no problem to us (in fact we felt an advantage) but it might be for some. It comes down to what you are looking for. There is a 'free' mini-bus service from the hotel to the city centre which runs from 10am to 11pm with a mid-day gap between 11am - 3pm. If you do use private taxis (we did on some occasions because the times of the 'free' bus did not always meet with our plans) then best to book yourselves. The journey should be no more than 100 MAD (¬£8) one way but if you ask the hotel to book for you then the price can be 220 MAD (¬£18). We used the taxi company who transferred us from the airport for most private journeys.  The Sirayane is probably best suited to couples and groups of adults rather than families though there was at least one family with children under 10 years and they seemed to be having a good time.    We stayed for 5 days and overall we would have no hesitation going back to the Sirayane. break. We used the well kept short-tennis court but didn't fit in a spa treatment.

They have added a new sports bar which adds a brighter area to relax and enjoy a drink with a pool table and TV screens as well as Shisha if that‚Äôs what you enjoy. There is a small gym and tennis courts as well as a library and quiet areas to sit. The Hammam was excellent and very good value. It has actually improved on last year and in fact it‚Äôs the best hammam I've had. Bouchra was not only very professional in her technique she also has a lovely personality. The huge double loungers make lying beside the pool a very comfortable experience with enough beds for everyone and tons of space on each bed. The standard of food at dinner is excellent with European and Moroccan food and a chef dedicated to each cuisine. We tried it all and loved it. Expertly crafted dishes beautifully presented from Fillet Mignon to freshly caught fish and seafood vegetarian options and of course cous-cous tagine and other Moroccan specialities and favourites. Our room was in the main hotel as requested overlooking the mountains. A lovely view morning and night as the light changed. The usual high specification in the room meant that we had his-and-her individual showers in the same shower area. They still have the sweet turn down service with towel sculptures and the towels are replaced as often as you want - you have the choice. Free wifi made keeping in touch back home or with business easy adding to the relaxation in fact. Breakfast was varied and plentiful although one thing I would say is that the fresh orange juice was so popular we hardly saw it! but there were several other choices available and it was the least of our concerns. There is still a free shuttle bus into town which means that you can go out for the day or evening without worrying about how to get back.The magic of the Sirayane is the peace and tranquility the focus on you as a guest the respect and helpfulness of the staff who have perfected the art of service with a genuinely helpful attitude as well as the simple beautiful design and architecture which all adds up to a relaxing and enjoyable experience and makes yo feel as though you are the only ones there.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Adriana J wrote a review Jan 2014,50,Time to relax!,We spent a week at the hotel for New Years Eve and also for a week afterwards. I absolutely recommend this place to stay if you have more than 3-4 days to enjoy your holidays. This hotel is an ideal place to escape from noisy Medina and enjoy your vacation - or a little break.    The hotel was very clean beautifully decorated with big nice rooms. We had an awesome room from our balcony with view on Atlas mountains + pool - I highly recommend this room - Nr. 103. We loved it - especially you have a nice corner relaxation spaces with pillows which reminds you that you are here to relax :-)    The service was excellent. We loved the young people working in the hotel - Sofyan and Sayd were an awesome company in a pool bar serving great drinks :-)  I have to say that it was my first time where I really met an owner of the hotel asking you if everything is ok and if there is something he can do to make your stay even better.    The breakfast was very nice - fresh orange juice and cucumber and the local mint tea - just amazing. I loved also the moroccan bread and fresh fruit was served every day. However I would love to have more local bread - we could not get enough!  The food in restaurant was not the best you can get in Morocco. The food is quiet expensive comparing to the local restaurants in the city where you can get the same quality for less money.    There is a free shuttle bus if you decide to venture out to the Medina. It goes 6 times during the day but the hotel is able to organise you also a taxi to bring you to city and pick you up - no problem convinient and on time. Maybe you would pay more than a local taxi but we were very happy with the service!    There are some trips organized by the Hotel at an additional cost. We went to the Ourika Valley and had a fantastic knowledgeable guide to take me there. We also visited different nice places in the valley - please pay attention on the restaurant the guide is taking you - he picked one place where the food was not good at all.    As far as the spa is concerned I would wholeheartedly recommend a hamman pedicure was nice and we also used the gym. It was very easy to get an appointment and enjoy you days :-) The prices are the same as in the city - so not a big difference.    We had a fantastic time at an excellent boutique hotel and spa we enjoyed the hotel a lot and our vacation in Morocco was one of the best!,Date of stay: January 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdrianaJ796

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Onlywumi wrote a review Dec 2013,30,"Beautiful Hotel, disappointing experience!",Despite the friendly service and presentation of the hotel my husband and I left very disappointed with our overall experience at the Sirayane boutique hotel Marrakech.    The decor and feel of the hotel was pleasant however we experienced several service breakdowns which were not resolved or handled efficiently by the hotel management.    The outdoor heated pool was not heated at least 2 days of our 4 night stay due to a technical fault and on one of the days remained closed (The weather was too cool to enjoy the other pool). We chose the hotel from many others for the use of a heated pool.    Being a 5* hotel the hotel only offer 7 tv channels of which 4 had no signal and were unavailable this left us with  1 English news channel to entertain us throughout. The hotel offered DVDs which were mainly french movies and a poor selection.    There was no ambiance or atmosphere at the hotel and we had no choice but to dine there (as there are no  restaurants in walking distance). The food was good but will cost approx ¬£30 - ¬£45per person for dinner (depending on the number of courses you choose). You are not allowed to bring any food or drink from outside the hotel.    The hotel itself was beautiful and the staff very attentive. We also enjoyed a very nice Hamman and spa treatment (additional charge).  It was a shame that the hotel lacked atmosphere and entertainment factor (no heated pool and 1 English news channel) which meant that  staying at the hotel was boring. We were limited to leaving the hotel as we travelled with our baby so the hotel choice played an important part of our trip.  (Personally I would not recommend for a family stay with children)    I understand that service issues do occur however we were disappointed further with the laid back attitude of the Management who failed to respond to our complaint as you would expect.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,DLMG wrote a review Dec 2013,30,Some issues,I was also lured by good reviews this hotel received but was left disappointed just like the reviewer from August 2011. Perhaps the intentions are good but the service at this hotel leave a lot to be desired...even though it looks like management is trying. So in my usual style:    Good  - rooms are comfortable/clean and quite surroundings make it good for sleeping and relaxing after a busy day/night in medina  - pool area is nice and service there i thought was efficient  - free shuttles to town run regularly and show up on time to pick you up  - breakfast ok but don't expect variety each day  - This is my follow up review since one issue was addressed by the hotel. At the end of our stay we had an issue with transport to agadir- driver took slow road rather than the highway which added 1-2 hours to the trip. The day after my initial review we were contacted by the hotel owner who called the transport company that in turn refunded our money for the service apologising for the driver who pocketed the pay highway fees.    Bad  - Indifferent attitude to customers - staff makes you feel like they are doing you a favour each time you ask for something  - gym opened only at 10am and when I asked if I can access earlier was told it is absolutely not possible....first time for me- I travel a lot business/personal and was never told opening the doors earlier is not possible  - we asked for a shuttle and a booking to a restaurant for 18:30 they drove us there- restaurant was closed- driver said they will open eventually and drove off- we called the hotel and were told the restaurant was open at 19:30!! We asked why they did not inform us when they made a reservation and they argued that we made the booking not them-this was clearly not what happened  - our bill had extra charges of about ¬£100 pounds....first time it ever happened to me and I have been to many hotels...they fixed it and proceeded to make excuses that someone put a wrong room number.      I don't like writing unfavourable reviews - and to be fair if you are planning a couple of days in marrakech will be out all day and need nothing from the hotel staff this can be an ok option -but would surely not recommend if you are planning a relaxing holiday with occasional town visit.,Date of stay: December 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DLMG

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Keith_and_Fiona wrote a review Dec 2013,50,Fantastic hotel!,My wife and I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights in November. We have been to a lot of hotels around the world but this is probably the best one we have ever stayed in!    Marrakech is great city but it is very hectic and this hotel offers the perfect retreat from that as it is a 15 minute drive from the centre. The hotel runs a free shuttle bus to the centre 6 times a day which we used both during the day and at night to get into Marrakech.    The hotel itself is very modern and spotlessly clean. We were upgraded to a garden suite which was great. The room was very spacious with all the modern facilities you would expect. The hotel only has 28 rooms which gives it a very personal feel.    The pool area was very relaxing ‚Äì double beds instead of sunloungers ‚Äì much more comfortable!    The staff were very attentive and friendly. The owner personally greeted us when we arrived and we met him on a few other occasions. He always asked if we were having a good stay we were really impressed that he took the time to do this.    The food in the hotel was fantastic! We had dinner in the hotel three out of the four nights we stayed here. There is a moroccan menu and a western menu ‚Äì we ate off the moroccan menu every night! Moroccan food is very tasty especially the tagines! The food in the hotel wasn't that cheap but we felt it was worth it as the quality of the food and the service were excellent.    Marrakech is a very interesting city. We visited the souks the main square Jardin Majorelle Ali Ben Youssef Medersa and the Marrakech Museum. All were very interesting to see and were very different. The souks were like a maze and the main square was manic but both were great to see. I'd also recommend going to see the sunset from rooftop terraces of Cafe de France or Grand Balcon du Cafe Glacier (just order a drink rather than having food).

Everything was perfect: the warm welcome from the reception staff with a glass of Moroccan mint tea who then proceeded to show us round the hotel and spa; the service from the pool and bar staff who anticipated our every need from topping up our wine glases to moving the sun umbrella; the log fire every evening in the lounge. Our room was upgraded on arrival to a mini-suite with a private garden leading to the swimming pool. A complementary shuttle service to the centre of Marrakesh was provided several times a day which was extremely punctual and reliable. A full range of treatments were available in the spa but we were content to lie in the sun on a double mattress with cushions and catch the last of the summer sun. The restaurant in the evening provided 2 menues one Moroccan and one international thereby providing a wide range of good quality meals to suit all tastes. The owner's philosophy of keeping the hotel small so that he and his staff can look after the guests better certainly works! A first class hotel with first class service!

Small intimate boutique hotel 15/20 mins from the city centre and only 10/15 mins from the airport. Welcomed on arrival by a glass of the local mint tea and an overview of the facilities by a friendly staff member. We had a mini-suite with a private garden leading to the pool. All the usual amenities; TV/DVD player kettle hairdryer safe etc. The main pool is pretty chilly this time of year but a small area is heated. Double mattresses & cushions with parasols in lieu of traditional sun loungers add to the romantic ambience of the place. Pretty well-kept gardens. Large lounge area even with log fire in the winter evenings. Library area. Although all public areas including reception are a little dark/ gloomy. If the weather is fine enough break can be taken outside. Breakfast is fully self-service. Hot drinks in insulated jugs. Limited cereal choice bread/rolls/pastries/cakes fruit yogurt cheese cold meats etc. Some cooked items. Omelettes can be requested. Very relaxed atmosphere. Unfortunately they seemed unable to accommodate an early breakfast request or packed alternative before our 7.30am pick-up for a full day trip. Also late check-out was unavailable. Complementary shuttle several times a day to and from the city. (Need to book and can get full). Excellent hotel which we would highly recommend for a quite romantic get-away break.    (Note you have to fill in a entry form upon arrival at the airport before you get to the passport desk. Our airline didn't mention this or hand out the forms on the plane. You also need to fill out a departure for when leaving.

I was lazily thinking about this when I noticed the shadow move - one of the staff had spotted that the sun was moving and moved the umbrella to a better position for me. A small thing but to me it showed how much they were thinking about everyone.    The free shuttle in and out of town is briliant. We also did some day trips and the hotel organised everything for us including guides.    We ate in the restaurant as well - it was not cheap but the food was amazing.

The staff were friendly except when we had problems with next door's aircon malfunctioning for 2 nights and just couldn't get a solution but after 2 nights of noise from it we were moved to another room.  Breakfast was good with plenty of choice. The down side was wifi reception was poor throughout the hotel.  The mini bus to and from town is essential as the hotel is a 15 min drive out of town. It was frequent and a second one was laid on if it got full.  This distance from town means you are in a tranquil setting (inside the hotel grounds) and can lie by the pool and look at the atlas mountains in the background. The area surrounding the hotel is arid farming land which is slowly being bought up and built on.

The hotel is just outside the city (bring a copy of the address with you for your arrival - the taxi drivers didn't know where it is!). The location is a huge selling point though - so peaceful yet with ample free shuttle buses to get to / from the city.  The restaurant food is competitively priced for good food in Marrakech (don't be fooled into thinking it's a cheap city if you want to eat well). Crepes and fresh juices for breakfast are a must. The steak on the Gastronomique menu with Chocolate Fondant dessert are devine! However the Sirayane Menu of traditional food is also delicious.  The staff are attentive without overdoing it. There was a great Spa offer of a hammam (being scrubbed washed and massaged in a steam room) followed by another massage and manicure/pedicure that was incredible value and blissful. The guys at the pool set up and adjust your double lounger (bed!) and umbrella before you can even get close to it!  The owner came round the dinner tables asking after us and how we were being treated almost daily - a really nice touch.  A trip to the Atlas Mountains is well worth it though it's a long day mostly in a 4x4 but the views hairy roads and kasbahs are fantastic.  We could confidently recommend this to anyone (unless you have kids over the age of 5 who want other kids to play with / a kids club). There were couples with babies and it seemed to work well as you can see your room from the restaurant).

The wifi connection seemed poor during our stay and there doesn't seem to be a smoking policy which is not good if you are a non smoker.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fraser121
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Davina083 wrote a review Oct 2013,50,Perfect Birthday Treat,I had always wanted to visit Marrakech and we booked this hotel as a treat to celebrate my 30th Birthday and I have to say that I enjoyed every moment of our stay. We booked a Mini Suite with private garden and on check in was allocated room 130 which I would say is located perfectly for the pool and the main hotel building. The room was clean comfy and spacious with a couple of small sofas and a wet room for showering. Upon our arrival we were seated in the reception area which is modern and comfortable. The staff were attentive without being intrusive and nothing was too much trouble for them. Check in was done by the staff whilst we sat and enjoyed a mint tea. We were shown to our room and it was discovered that our airconditioning was not working - this was not a problem as a member of staff arrived within a few minutes and the problem was fixed. The pool is lovely although a little bit chilly around the pool there are large double sunloungers with pillows which are very comfortable and there is a drinks service poolside. The food here is a little on the expensive side compared to other restaurants we ate in in Marrakech - however the food was amazing and worth the money as we could enjoy it in such tranquil surroundings. There is a free shuttle into Marrakech which we used on a few occasions - the driver even gave us a little tour on one of the days. Marrakech is very busy food in the city is very good and the people are very friendly and welcoming - the Sirayane is a welcome break from the bussle of the city. The photographs that I have seen of this hotel do not really do it justice. This was a very enjoyable stay and I would highly recommend this hotel to people looking to relax and eat nice food with the option to explore Marrakech. I stayed at this hotel with my partner leaving our 3 year old son at home and although the hotel allows children I would not say that it is a hotel suitable for children purely down to the fact that there isnt really anything for them to do and they are not catered for food wise also childen playing and being noisy would probably spoil other peoples enjoyment of this tranquil hotel.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Wolverhampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Davina083
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,TonyFerguson wrote a review Oct 2013,50,Best of both worlds in Marrakech,I took my wife here for a surprise week in September. She only found out the night before we flew to Marrakech. I booked this after a lot of searching and researching on hotels and Riads in Marrakech. I wanted something that would enable us to see some of the sites in Marrakech whilst having the benefit of a swimming pool. A number of Riads in the medina seemed to have pools but mostly either very small and/or hidden in a courtyard away from the sun. This hotel has a lovely pool with wonderful square double sunbeds and a free bus five or six times a day to take you in and out of the centre of Marrakech. Free (and good) WiFi is also an essential for us and aircon in the rooms in case it got too hot (for me). This hotel met all these criteria and with some style. The staff and attentive owner were brilliant and nothing was too much trouble for them. I also had a massage in the Spa which was fantastic. I have had massages in many different places but this is the only place where they leave you for five minutes at the end to allow you to come round in your own time - fantastic given that by that stage in a massage I am pretty much asleep. I could not recommend this place more highly and when we come back to Marrakech we will definitely stay here again,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Newbury, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyFerguson

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,leilaferguson wrote a review Sep 2013,50,"Fantastic Hotel, Fantastic Staff","On Friday I knew I was going to have a weeks holiday and thought I was going to stay at home with a couple of days in Torquay. I whinged and whined to all my staff and made arrangements for meetings so that I could come into work anyway. My major whine was ""Well it's not exactly Morocco is it?"" How did I not pick up on anything? Everybody seemed normal and I got back home on Friday to a Tony who kept asking me to look on Facebook. I didn't get it as I had blogs to do so it took some persuading. There was a message from our dog (don't ask) telling me he was on holiday and I needed to look under my pillow there was a book on Morocco and the news that we were going there at 8 am the next day!    I squealed and ran round in circles wasting valuable packing time. Ok then blah blah blah nice trip nice country and then we came to the hotel. Oh my it is wonderful. It has been open for a couple of years and we were warmly welcomed into a dark but impressive reception. The whole hotel has been carefully designed in conjunction with the owner who is very present always a very good sign. Everything is dealt with quickly and efficiently you are shown around the hotel and then we went to our room. We had a garden room with a private garden the interesting thing is that the hotel was fully booked (28 rooms 4 with private pools) yet it felt like there were very few guests because of the excellent design. The main pool was at a lower level with double sun beds around it and staff who saw to all our needs.    The room was perfect great wifi and what I assumed was a great flat screen etc but we didn't use it as the pool was so inviting. There was a rainhead shower separate toilet thick cotton robes and a lovely comfortable bed.    Tony tried out the spa and said it was really good and they did something he has never experienced before which was being left after the massage to come round and wake up.    We saw the owner Mehdi nearly every day this hotel is obviously his passion and it shows. He was friendly without being obtrusive and went out of his way to make sure we had a fantastic stay. There are free shuttle buses into Marrakesh driven by friendly drivers who give a brief history of what we are passing and advising on what to do when we get into the city.    The breakfast was extensive and my only quibble is that I would have liked a little more choice in the cooked breakfast but when in Morocco you eat Moroccan and the rest was lovely they even had cucumber juice!    I will be doing a blog on this hotel on http://leilaslocallarder.wordpress.com and have radioed Mehdi for Kennet Radio. The food was great well cooked with a great selection of local and international food. If I go back to Marrakesh I would go back to this hotel like a shot.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,2tulum wrote a review Sep 2013,50,You wish every hotel you check into were like this!,Hotel Sirayane is the hotel you wish you were checking into.    It is a beautiful peaceful and tranquil place. It is wonderfully designed and well thought out. The d√©cor and vibe is very sexy and laid back. It is intimate and small but there are lounge spaces where you can relax in solitude and the lay out is such that it feels very private.    There is a beautiful pool a splashing fountain and pretty flowering gardens. The rooms have lots of amenities and some have private pools and walled yards. The rose petals strewn in the rooms are so welcoming.    But it is the people who make Hotel Sirayane so special. They are what distinguish this hotel from anywhere else. The owner is on hand to be sure you have whatever you may need. The front desk staff members accomplish everything efficiently and effortlessly. The bar and restaurant staff are friendly and accommodating. The staff are plentiful and there when you need them but never obtrusive.    The food is delicious. I especially loved the quiche. Breakfast is bountiful.    My partner had a terrible facial trauma injury while we were in Morocco. We just cannot give enough compliments to the entire staff for their care and consideration. Part of our stay she was in bed while I handled the logistics of getting us home for her medical treatment. The owner inquired after her comfort and condition each day. The restaurant staff made her pureed vegetable soup and milkshakes. And the front desk manager performed numerous kindnesses to assist us; we think of him as a treasured friend. Everyone truly went above and beyond for us during our crisis.    You will not need this kind of attention but know that when you enjoy this lovely hotel on your holiday you will be well looked after and you will love every minute of being at this wonderful oasis.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,FRAHtravels wrote a review Sep 2013,50,Relaxing and tranquil stay in Marrakech,My husband and I booked this hotel specifically for the private pool suites and as a base to explore the city from. We had a lovely time and couldnt have asked for more.  The private pool was in a walled garden so completely private and larger than the usual plunge pools you get even in the Maldives.  Housekeeping tidied our room twice a day with roses on the bed at night. The hotel as a whole was impeccably clean and well designed. Staff were helpful and friendly and the hotel owner was always about and checked on us to see how our stay was.  Breakfast was good and extensive although one suggestion is to vary it daily to keep guests interested for example eggs prepared in a different way everyday.  We had a hammam spa which was great and very relaxing - our only qualms were that the skin was not scrubbed vigorously so that all the dead skin was removed like in the traditional hammams and we paid extra for a foot massage to be included which didnt happen.  There was a free shuttle service to and from the city which ran at very convenient times and would pick us up at exactly the organised time not a second earlier or later! The drivers were very friendly throughout.  All in all a lovely stay!! Highly recommended!,Date of stay: September 2013,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FRAHtravels
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,MallyD50 wrote a review Sep 2013,50,Great little haven away from the madness that is marrakesh,We have never placed a review on trip advisor before but after spending a week at the siryane we rely compelled to share our experience so that others can enjoy what is a hidden gem sieving marrakesh. The hotel is the ideal place to see marrakesh fromthe hotel provides a free shuttle into the city which is not only great transport but is fantastic for getting to know fellow guests of all nationalities. The Siryane has a wonderful intimate feel with very friendly & helpful staff and a very hands on owner who is very visible to guests. The food at the hotel was great so much so that we only ate in marrakesh on 2 of our 7 nights! It is very peaceful with well equipped rooms & no fighting for sun beds with only 28 rooms. The size of the hotel is a major factor & definitely influenced us to book in the first place and gives guests the real feel that the staff know them & interact with them. It's also great for getting to know fellow guests and we met and chatted to very nice people from holland & France as well as a good proportion of fellow Brits. If you want to see marrakesh stay outside of the madness which is the city & visit from the siryane if you can tear yourself away from the tranquility the hotel provides.,Date of stay: September 2013,,"York, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MallyD50

Sadly there wasn't any availability for this - however the hotel was certainly not over crowded quite the opposite we felt there was plenty of beautiful open space and privacy. The staff (of which there were many) were always available to help with a smile but not intrusive. The rooms were clean and well presented. The food was top notch with plenty of choice.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Gascoigne A wrote a review Sep 2013,40,A tranquil retreat!,I stayed at this hotel from the 2nd - 9th Sept and all I can say is the review left by 'Zvetlana Z' on the 11th Aug could not be further from the truth! It has clearly been left by somebody trying to sabotage the business as I business owner myself I have also experienced this. The hotel is not far from the town. It is in fact about a 10-15 min drive from the town made easy by the free hotel shuttle provided by the hotel and the distance makes for a nice escape from the hustle and bustle of the old city. The shuttle comes at regular intervals and its great as its saves you a ¬£10 taxi fair in to the city.    I arrived at the hotel at 11.30pm where I was met by Bader who out of all the staff has the best English. There was a gorgeous traditional sweet peppermint tea and then given a brief tour before being shown to my room.    I stayed in the delux junoir suite with private pool which was just gorgeous...this is a bungalow type house separate from the hotel....the bed was huge and as an insomniac I was more than pleased to have a full 9 hrs of uninterrupted sleep! The bathroom with walk in shower and separate jacuzzi hot tub were amazing! A good selection of toiletries refreshed everyday plus gowns and slippers provided. The suite included 2 large tvs with DVD players which I found nice for when I had spent all day exploring the crazy city to get in to bed and watch a DVD (as I have problems getting to sleep without watching the tv...grrrrrrr). The garden in our suite was a good size well kept soooooo quiet with a private pool...the garden is surrounded by a high wall so its completely private. The description by the hotel says its a plunge pool but its not what we would describe as a plunge pool in the uk and is in fact much bigger and suitable for a nice swim. The rooms are cleaned well normally while I was out at breakfast and then the beds turned down at night on my return to the room.    The menu in the bar/ restaurant and for room service I did feel was a bit limited considering the hotel is in a remote area but I am the worst kind of eater...a very fussy vegetarian! However after speaking to the owner and staff they were more than obliging to cook whatever I requested for me. The daily breakfast is a great selection of cereals pastries fruits juices omlettes susages etc.    With the room booking I got a free Hammam massage which was just gorgeous! Im not really one for spending time pampering myself due to my busy schedule but this was really impressive and relaxing!    The overall interior is gorgeous very boutique and want to take many ideas from this hotel when designing my house build next year.    All the staff are very friendly welcoming professional and look neat and tidy which is very different from the locals working down in the bars/ restaurants in the old city! Plus the owner is always on hand and makes the effort to come and chat personally to all the guests which is always a nice touch. You also dont get the feeling that the staff are expecting tips which is nice.    The only reason I have given this 4 stars and not 5 stars is because of two reason. Firstly on the first night there is a 1.5l bottle of water left in your room but this wasnt refreshed and for a 5 star hotel costing just over ¬£2000 for the week I felt a bottle of water (at a cost price to them of probably ¬£1) wouldn't have been too much to ask that this was refreshed daily....especially when there is a note in the hotel guidelines saying you arent allowed to bring your own drinks in from outside so there is no choice other than to pay for the water from the mini bar. Secondly I ordered room service on two occasions and both times is was slightly wrong. This is not a complaint but feedback for the hotel for future guests.    Overall this is a really gorgeous hotel and would definitely stay here if I ever return back to Marrakech.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,seronok wrote a review Sep 2013,40,Attentive owner and great staff,My wife and I enjoyed four days at this hotel after three nights in a marvellous Riad in the heart of Marrakech. We had room 119 which has its own private garden and swimming pool. Therefore we did not have any need to sample the (fantastic looking!) pool in the middle of the complex. We rather felt that we were the oldest couple staying in the hotel. At breakfast and dinner the other clients looked much younger (30's and 40's rather than 50's and 60's!!).  The hotel owner Mehdi is great. He makes it his business to check on all guests every day usually in the evening at dinner. His staff are very happy helpful and we thought that they were great fun to talk to and to joke with.  This was our first visit to Morocco. We like spicy Asian type food. The food at this hotel was better than we had had in the heart of Marrakech but more ginger and garlic would have improved the taste! This is not a complaint! - just that we probably don't like Moroccan food that much!  We do wonder whether this hotel is really 5*. The wood-work carpentry in our room was not as good as I can do - the wi-fi signal occasionally went down as did the TV and the power.  However we did have a very good time relaxing in a great atmosphere and with reservations we thoroughly recommend this hotel.

The owner never failed to check how we were every day and personally arranged things like an early breakfast when we were setting out on a trip. Coming back to the hotel after a crazy day of sightseeing was like coming home. The shuttle bus service is excellent and takes you to and from the centre of Marrakesh without any bother or concern. Make time for several trips to the spa! The traditional facial is heavenly and the oriental massage was so relaxing I had trouble waking up afterwards!

The shuttle bus service provided by the hotel was fantastic and works on to the exact minute. The staff provides exceptional service and the spa facilities were fantastic. Had a Hammam treatment for 660 dirhams and worth every dirham. As for food the lunch menu was great and reasonably priced but the dinner was not for my liking. But that's just my opinion and may be I picked wrong dishes. I must reiterate the service was exceptional I was there with my 3 1/2yr old girl and when I needed milk for her provided me with it in minutes also when I requested for some medicine for myself got that for me within hours.

Yes a Riad is more authentic but you really can have two holidays in one here. You can relax by the lovely pool in the daytime and head to the Medina later in the afternoon when it gets a little cooler. Its a small hotel so still personal and the staff are extremely welcoming.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Sophie P wrote a review Jul 2013,50,First Marrakech experience,My boyfriend and I just returned back from a lovely 9 days in Marrakech. We didn't realise that when we arrived a shuttle is waiting to take you to the hotel so we ended up getting a taxi which costed us 300 dirhams. The hotel really is tucked away on the side of the main road so there is nothing around within walking distance. The hotel has extremely friendly and professional staff. The owner was also kind enough to chat to us a couple of nights and give us some recommendations on where to go out for dinner. If we weren't eating in the hotel we'd get a private shuttle (which the hotel arranges but is chargeable) to the new town - Medina Hivernage etc. A couple that we went to were 'Le Comptoir' and 'Jad Mahal' which were very nice and had belly dancers. Keep in mind that restaurants and bars do not get busy until really late so we had to get use to eating late at night. There is a free shuttle into the old town where the markets are and like I already mentioned you can arrange a private shuttle to anywhere you wish they will also pick you up anywhere. When the owner introduced us to this we were under the impression there was no charge until we got the hotel bill. The food at the hotel is lovely but the only thing I personally wasn't pleased about was the 10% service charge everytime you order food. We took advantage of the spa and got a back massage which was 300 dirhams each. It was also refreshing not having to fight for sun lounges! The pool boy was very helpful and sets up a sun bed for you.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,James D wrote a review Jul 2013,50,Pure calm!,Stayed here for a celebratory few days away in the sun with the intent of relaxing and not doing too much apart from eating out in the evening and reading by the pool in the day - for which this place is perfect if a little far from town (although there is a free shuttle).    Charming staff who made every effort to look after us plenty of room by pool and nice air-conditioned room (which was a life-saver given how hot it gets).    I would recommend the airport and the free shuttle into town is good for the evening. And they will arrange a private car if you prefer.,Date of stay: June 2013,,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jdingley
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Becky F wrote a review Jun 2013,50,Fantastic Hotel !,I stayed at the Sirayane Boutique Hotel and Spa with a friend for a week mid June and it was excellent. We booked a hotel transfer from the airport which was easy to find. When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by the owner and given our welcome drink of mint tea which is delicious. We then found out that we had been upgraded twice and were given a villa by the pool with a private garden which was incredible. The room was spotless and the bed very comfortable.  We ate at the hotel on three out of the seven nights we stayed. As expected the food is quite pricey compared to the restaurants in the center of Marrakech but the food was great. However i do recommend getting the free shuttle but into the center for your evening meals as there are some incredible cheap restaurants. The selection at breakfast was plentiful - hot cold fruit juices. Everything that you would need.  The service was mostly exceptional. The owner would come round whilst we were eating to make sure everything was perfect which in my oppinion make such a difference to a hotel. He genuinly wanted to make sure we were 100% catered for. The only slight issue i have with the service was the drinks service by the pool. We would have to go up to the bar to get water and even then a 10% service charge was added on top of it. Some days noone ever came around to ask if we wanted a drink by the pool.  Overall though it t was an amazing holiday so thank you very much Sirayane.,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeckyF986
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,sophiecart wrote a review Jun 2013,50,"Beautiful hotel, good food and great staff!",I stayed at Sirayane with a friend for a week from 15 to 22 June. We booked a pickup from the airport which we found easily after coming through arrivals and saved the hassle of trying to get a taxi at the airport.  On arrival at the hotel we were given some of the local mint tea (delicious!) and a tour of the hotel ending at our room. We had been upgraded not only once but twice - a brilliant surprise and the room was beautiful. (A room by the pool with private garden)  The breakfast was good - a good selection of food and fruit as well as a variety of fresh fruit juices which were delicious.  The staff were all very friendly and helpful and the owner came round every day and greeted us and checked that we were enjoying ourselves/that everything was okay. This kind of care and attention really makes such a difference and is much appreciated!  The food is good although as expected with a good hotel is at a markup to prices in the centre. We ate dinner in the hotel on 3 nights and at restaurants around the medina on the other 4 nights.  The only small complaint I would have is that the waiter service by the pool was practically non existent. A waiter would come round to offer drinks once a day or maybe twice if you were lucky. We just would go into the bar to get ourselves drinks but it would be quite easy for a waiter to do a loop round the pool every hour to check if anyone wanted anything and this would make a big difference.  All in all though the hotel was brilliant and I would definitely go back! The free shuttle into town was also great. There are quite a few each day - it was easy to go in for dinner on the 7.30pm shuttle and return on the 10pm shuttle. The medina is a 15 minute drive from the hotel. However if you do want to go in at a different time to the shuttle (for example we went to the Jardins Majorelle one afternoon. As it closed at 6pm we wanted to arrive there for 5pm which wasn't possible with the buses - there's one at either 3pm or 5pm. 3pm too early and too hot 5pm too late) then a taxi through the hotel costs 20 Euros/220 Dirhams. We got a taxi from the centre to the hotel for 80 Dirhams so a taxi from the hotel does cost quite a lot more than the local rate.  Overall though a brilliant trip and hotel very relaxing and enjoyable with great staff!,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sophiecart
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,SahilSharma1985 wrote a review Jun 2013,30,Excellent Room at a price with some flaws...,As we were shown to the room we were told we had the best room in the hotel. It was a great room with a private swimming pool and there wasn't any need to leave the room. Meals (pricey and of 3.5/5 quality) could be taken in the room at no extra charge and rooms were comfortable. It was cheaper & better to take the shuttle into the Medina for a better more pleasant meal.    The second day we both had a pedicure in separate rooms. To say this was disappointing would be an understatement. This was priced at about ¬£16-17 and was quoted at being 30 minutes in the brochure. The treatment room was pleasant and calming we were lay down on the massage table with a towel covering our eyes. I rekon I had no more than 7-8 minutes of work done. The beautician was out of the room more than she was in the room. After about 15 minutes she turned the lights out went back outside to let me sleep? and then returned 10 minutes later to say it was finished. Needless to say this is the worst spa experience I have had to date and did not book any further treatments (one of the main reasons for booking the hotel)    The hotel itself is nice and peaceful but there are plenty a little problems. A decent escape from Marrakech madness but could probably find better.,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Royal Tunbridge Wells, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SahilSharma1985

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Jen B wrote a review Jun 2013,40,Beautiful place to relax,This hotel is beautiful with friendly and helpful staff that make your stay special. It is clean and a sense of calm envelopes you as you arrive and sip mint tea!  The spa was also wonderful with very friendly and helpful therapists.  Our only gripe was that the food and drinks were expensive (approx 2 or 3 times more) compared with similar delicious meals we had at other venues in Marrakech (our guide who we arranged independetly had also had feedback from other's staying here that the hotel food and drinks were rather expensive) The hotel is quite a drive from anywhere so you rely on the shuttle bus to take you to alternatives for meals -having your meals at the hotel is the hassle free option when all you want to do is relax so they are on to a winner here!  Apart from this we would recommend the Sirayne to people wanting to get away from it all and completely relax in such a beautiful country with the hussle and bussle of the town only 15 minutes away if you feel up to it.,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Exeter, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenb728

I think this illustrates that they have got the blend just right: there was always a huge sun bed to lie on by the pool always space on the transfers into town a waiter to get you a drink etc.    Not a place for families with young children I'd say but ideal for those seeking a romantic and/or chilled-out break.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,lovingTurkeyholidays wrote a review Jun 2013,50,staff turn a good hotel into a great hotel,There is very little not to like here.  Service was amazing - not too in your face but personal and friendly.    Room - suite with private pool - lovely clean great facilities - one of the nicest rooms I have ever stayed in.    Facilities - we like to sit in the bar and people watch - often hotels don't have enough seating spaces - but here there was inside outside a library the bar - or your own private space - Superb.    What would I change?  Minibar in room had no diet drinks - I did mention this but there is a standard stock list- not a major issue just a slight inconvenience for someone too incredibly lazy to walk to the bar!    The price of drinks is what you would expect but in a hot country you need to drink a lot so this will add to your bill.    As a vegetarian I had emailed the hotel prior to our arrival to ensure that this could be catered for. There were certainly options but some of these ran out limiting my choice - not an issue if we hadn't been staying full board but the menu got a little repetitive. Neither were they able to swap a dinner time starter to a lunch time main course which could have increased some of the variety. However the food was wonderful and dinner was relaxed with great service - my fault again for not eating meat or fish!    We were charged for a spa treatment we never had - thank goodness we checked the bill thoroughly. Errors can happen but unfortunately when it is the last thing that happens before you leave it can stay with you.,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovingTurkeyholidays

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Mark S wrote a review Jun 2013,50,Lovely hotel,"My wife and I have just returned from a 5 night stay here. The hotel itself was very nice. Rooms spacious very comfortable (air conditioned nice solid beds) and well equipped (safe free wifi good sized kettle etc). The pool sunbeds and poolside area in general were idyllic.    As others have commented though perfectly acceptable the many times we ate there there's better food to be found around Marrakech for the more explorative - but that's pretty much our only ""complaint"".    The drinks menu seemed a little pricey - around ¬£8 for a spirit plus mixer though once I tried and realised it was more like a triple or quadruple measure that made it a lot more reasonable. The only place in town we went that also served spirits was a similar price if not slightly more expensive.    The most note-worthy aspect in my opinion were the staff. Always friendly smiling and more than happy to help. Nothing was too much trouble. They were rarely out of sight but never in the way. The balance was perfect for a relaxing getaway. Almost all of the staff spoke near-perfect English though I did have to think back to GCSE French on a few occasions. Overall language barrier wasn't a problem.    I haven't confirmed the figures but I heard that the hotel sleeps 56 and that there are around 50 staff members which seems about right to me. The manager was also always around and happy to chat - we spoke to him at least once a day and each time he recognised us and knew about any issues that had cropped up (a failed wireless router required replacing in our room) and he made sure that we were being well looked after.    The hotel has a large number of birds residing in ""eaves"". They could get a little vocal early in the mornings but once you get used to that they're really quite interesting to watch when you're sat outside taking in the glorious weather. We suspect that they contributed to the total lack of bugs though were also informed by the manager when we questioned this that the hotel is thoroughly ""treated"" every 3 weeks to ensure no bugs.    Regular free minibuses into central Marrakech were great the trip to the Atlas mountains/waterfalls (run by the hotel) was also very interesting - probably the most interesting day of our holiday - we came back with a few souvenirs and some great photos and memories. Omar our driver for the day was very accommodating. Said another of the drivers also recommended a lovely restaurant to us (Dar Zellige) and even dropped us close to it so that we didn't struggle to find it.    Hopefully we can return again one day.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,LikingLuxury wrote a review Jun 2013,40,6 relaxing days,Overall we had a very enjoyable stay.    We had 6 nights in a pool villa recently and were very impressed with the accommodation particularly the pool which my 4 year old loved ( obviously.) Excellent big walk in shower made from concrete. Room kept spotless and well made-up during our stay. I thought the room was very good value.    Service was friendly and attentive although we had the occasional wooden service moment for example discord about where we sat in the restaurant.    Breakfast fine lunch ok; food just didn't light my fire though and I like to look forward to meals when I stay at a hotel. Food not bad  just not memorable and so we went out most nights.    Well organised transfers to and from the airport / city. We opted for private ones but the hotel's shuttle seemed to work really well.    Enough wireless service to get your mail or view the web from time to time; don't expect continuous service though.    My wife used the spa and didn't like the massage ( including certain bits should be agreed up front she says) but enjoyed the hamman.    Little niggles; cold drinks not cold being charged ( sometimes) for a decent coffee at breakfast laminated menus :(  diesel generator adjacent to our villa operated occasionally could be slightly more family friendly    Worth noting: some limited air traffic close by during our stay.... which in my case helped relieve the tedium of sunbathing.,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LikingLuxury

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Innocent99 wrote a review May 2013,40,Relaxing stay,My partner and I stayed in this hotel for four nights in March. It was a very relaxing stay. We used the shuttle bus from the airport 20 Euros and as many reviewers have mentioned the airport is not far but it made life easy to have a car waiting for you on arrival. It was easy to arrange by e-mail before travel and the cost was added to our bill.    The hotel is situated on the outskirts of town and we were quite grateful to have a place of rest away from the crowds and noise of town. The free shuttle bus was handy the return times can be a bit odd in comparison to the departure times. Departure times when we stayed were 09h30 11h 15h 17h 19h30 and 22h30 while return times were 10h30 13h 15h45 18h30 22h and 23h15. If many guests book for a certain time the hotel did organize two buses so we were always guaranteed a seat. Although if you missed a bus or wanted to go to town at a different time from the shuttle a private car at 20 Euros could be arranged.    Breakfast had a good range of itemshot and cold the only thing we did not like was that on occasions birds flew in and nibbled at the croissants and pastries. These were usually replaced only if noticed by staff. I think it would be a good idea to have mesh covers for such items to prevent this.    There was a really nice fire place which was lovely to sit by in the evening and have a drink.    We had a superior room with balcony which overlooked the pool. It was a good size and very clean. The evening turn down service with rose petals was a nice touch.    In all I can not really fault the hotel the staff are really friendly especially Simon at reception who was always so helpful with information.    If you want somewhere away from town that has good service clean decent sized rooms a nice atmosphere and willing to pay that bit extra then I would recommend this hotel.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Innocent99
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,The_4_Roses wrote a review May 2013,40,Relaxed Family Holiday in Marrakech,Just returned from a 9 night stay in this lovely hotel which my husband booked. It was our first holiday as a family with our daughter of 8 months and I am 6 months pregnant with our 2nd bundle of joy! It is a wonderful hotel for quiet relaxation and although it is quiet we didn't feel uncomfortable having our cute noisy little bundle of joy with us by the pool in fact everyone adored her and she got lots of fuss and attention much to her delight!    The restaurant waiters and pool attendants were fab and very friendly. I have only rated service as average as we have been fortunate to stay in various highly rated hotels worldwide and the service in general i.e. reception advice on where to eat were to go room service etc was not of the high standard we have experienced elsewhere. I'm not sure if this was a language barrier but every time we asked for a recommendation for a place to go or restaurant to eat in we were told it would not be suitable with a child but no other alternative was offered.    We are use to London prices and found the hotel expensive but the quality of the food was of a high standard yum! Rooms were very slick and stylish and a peaceful night‚Äôs sleep was had (well as peaceful as you can imagine with an 8 month old) :-) Cleanliness was great and cleaners were very friendly and did a fab job I've never stayed somewhere where the cleaner waits outside to clean your room if you put a do not disturb sign up (due to baby sleeping).    Location I rated as average as although my husband said he picked it so we were not in the heart of Marrakech and therefore wouldn't hear the prayers at 4am there is nothing you can walk to from this hotel. You have to either get a transfer (times of transfers are unusual) or you have to book their private car at 20 euros one way. The hotel will not book you a normal taxi you have to use their private car which is the same as the shuttle except your using it at a different time we got a return from the medina one of the days at 100 dirham.    I put the children‚Äôs activities as 1 only because there weren't any. My husband said it was a family friendly resort and the staff did make a fuss of our little one but the travel cot in the room had a tear in it which we only noticed when we put her in it and she could have rolled out!!! As it was late we switched the cot around so it was facing the wall i.e. she couldn‚Äôt fall out of the broken side. There was only 1 highchair in the restaurant so if another family was using it then you would have to use your pushchair to feed little one. We had a suite room so all on the ground floor which was great with the buggy. The pool was very cold as we had beautiful weather the it certainly worked a treat to cool us down but I had to play a game with my daughter to get her in without crying as she is use to a warm pool in the UK for her swimming lessons. Once she was in though she was fine and loved it!    I sampled a treatment at the spa and really enjoyed it but the English was not good and the lady had to leave to get someone to translate when I asked for an extra pillow as I can't lay flat while pregnant. Nothing was asked i.e. any allergies to what they were using (I wasn't sure what was used!) or any additional requirements due to being pregnant. The treatment itself was on par with others I have had elsewhere. I had a look at the gym which was small but had all you needed for a workout (not that I did one in my condition!)    The style and design of the hotels is wonderful and it was great for what we wanted on this occasion i.e. a quiet relaxed break away before our second baby is born and I would recommend it as a very good hotel for a break away.

Unless you want to eat tagines all week (they are great) most of the other choices will cost ‚Ç¨35 for two courses.  If you are a vegaterian they will made something special but options are limited.

It truly is a tranquil and peaceful place and will make you feeling relaxed.    We stayed in room 118 which had a private pool. Those that want a bit more privacy should definitely consider a room with a pool. Although the main public pool is also very nice and seemed quiet enough to be able to spend the day relaxing there.    All the staff are really pleasant.    Saeed one of the drivers for the shuttle service is extremely helpful very honest and very informative. He is an excellent tourguide and you should book him for excursions. We were looking for a restuarant for spicy tagines and he went out his way to take us to a restaurant which was hidden in the old town and it was probably one of the best meals we had whilst in Marrakech.    We plan to go back every few years just to wind down and relax for a few days.

Upon our arrival we were greeted by very friendly staff who then escorted us to our room. The room was lovely and had it's own garden which was open allowing you to go backwards and forwards to the pool when you wanted. The room was clean and very well decorated. There was a TV with DVD player. Channels are limited but they do have a collection of films in reception. With regards to food - there is a breakfast buffet. There is a lunch menu and a dinner menu. Prices are reasonable and the food is very good. The owner introduced himself to us the first evening we got there and came and spoke to us every day/evening during our stay wanting to make sure everything was ok. There were a couple of things we spoke to him about and he sorted it straight away. We treated ourselves to a massage the day before we left - if you suffer with any kind of back pain make sure you tell the masseuse as they don't ask you any questions when you go for your treatment or ask what level of pressure you want. We left the hotel relaxed and refreshed and it was just what we needed and we would definitely go back there again.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Ashford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wishinguwerehere
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,christine b wrote a review May 2013,50,superb sirayane,Hotel superb Sirayane. A calm setting after the hustle and bustle of Marrakesh. Owner takes a personal interest and all the staff were helpful and friendly couldn't do enough for you. Superb massage in the spa food good prices reasonable. Went on 3 trips 1.Essaouira on coast. Long journey- 3.5 hrs going (stopped at womens co-operative)and 2.5 returning but well worth it streets more spacious than Marrakesh some nice jewelry shops less hassle in the market. Harbour area full of fishing boatsd and the days catch and frsh fish chosen by you cooked for you at quayside.  2.trip round Marrakesh- did this on day 1 and were glad we did as we then had confidence to go in again on our own. Visited a palace tombs souks carpet place- felt a bit hi-jacked here as they wanted to sell carpets bakery. Hotel Ali was best for money exchange and try and keep plenty of small change for tips. 3. Camel ride- glad we did it but wouldn't go again(we are in 60s!!!)Went in morning to avoid heat but did not succeed!! Palm groves offered no shade in fact there were hardly any palms. Visited a small hamlet for tea wished we had more small change for children. Camels were good fun felt quite safe even if a bit uncomfortable at times.,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Bolton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christineb364
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,DeborahBurges wrote a review May 2013,50,Gorgeous Little Haven of Luxury and Pamering,We could not fault this hotel and spa.  The service is welcoming and professional and nothing is too trouble - the whole team seem to really want you to have a great time and you can tell high standards are continually aspired to.  The suite we had with its own garden which lead out to the pool and loungers was excellent. We liked the big comfy poolside beds with large umbellas - where a poolside duty person comes and moves it for you as the sun changes position as you wish and the gorgeous cocktails we were served as we relaxed and listened to some great background music.  The Spa treatments were first rate and amongst the best I've has anywhere in the world.  The food is good but choice may become a little tiring if you were staying for a full week.  There is an excellent hotel shuttle bus service to get you to and from the medina which helped take out any worry you might have of using the sometimes dubious taxi services.  Overall - if you are going to Marrakech you could not find a better place to stay and relax.,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Solihull, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeborahBurges

We have just returned from our second visit and will definitely be returning next time we need a relaxing break in the sun.  I highly recommend the hotel the free shuttle into Marrakech is a welcome perk as is the pickup facility from the airport.

The restaurant and bar serve a good selection of quality dishes and drinks and the buffet breakfast is fantastic with a very large selection of hot and cold foods and drinks. The shuttle buses were fantastic and run 6 times a day including throughout the evening. I can't remember the gentlemans name but he was on reception and was so sweet and helpful he got me scales to weight something I had bought in the souks and helped me print my boarding pass. A very special thank you is needed for Said he drives the shuttle buses and we did an atlas mountains tour with him (highly recommend) he speaks perfect English and was always looking out for our safety he is very knowledgeable and shared this information and he also became like an extra friend on our holiday...he is a credit to the hotel.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Gordon S wrote a review Apr 2013,50,Great Expectations.....are surpassed,Here your expectations are exceeded and although not the most expensive (nor the cheapest) in Marrakech you will have to work very hard to find one where the attitude and service levels from all staff are equalled where the rooms are as comfortable the pool area is as relaxing; no shortage of beds towels or staff willing to help and the restaurant is a very relaxing place to have dinner or lunch either inside or outside - we had dinner 2 night out of 5 night lunch every day and everything worked!    Mehdi Bennani Smires the proprietor is 'hands on' keen to make sure his guest are at ease and setting the tone for his staff. Miriam who was No2 when we were there was equally attentive and managed all customer requests in an affable and reassuring way.    The gym; 2 treadmills 1 reclining bike and I sit up bike plus limited weights is enough for a reasonable workout. We did not try the Spa but everyone seemed very happy when coming out!    This hotel is close enough to town to explore Marrakech so do take advantage of the free shuttle bus as it is only a 15 mins ride but yet the hotel is so peaceful -you will sleep later than you do at home (promise).

It is a little way (10-20 minutes depending on time of day and traffic) out of Marrakech city centre but the hotel runs a fee shuttle several times a day. Therefore the hotel is out of the way and very quiet ideal for a relaxing time.    Our room was a garden room which was big and well appointed - great shower! The bed in our room was big and very comfortable. We had our own little garden with loungers but when we did sit out we walked the extra few feet to the pool where there are plenty of beds. Service was exceptional the staff were always around when you wanted them and the owner spoke to us regularly to make sure all was well.    The food was good quality but a little pricey compared to in town but I guess you pay for convenience and a captive market.

The staff ranging from the bar staff reception staff pool attendant and restuarant staff were attentive and helpful. The owner took the time to speak to us daily which was appreciated by us. The rooms are lovely spacious and spotlessly clean but we have to agree the matress on the bed was a little hard for our liking. We hired a guide through the reception staff and he was worth the minimal expense to walk us around the medina and show us sight we wouldn't have seen without him such as a bakery and the university. We would highly recommend this hotel it is far enough from the hussle and bustle but easily accessible with the free shuttle bus.

We liked the spacious relaxed feel of the hotel set back from the main road only about 20 minutes from Marrakech.    The room we had was pleasant and well equipped.    The restaurant and bar staff were attentive and the service and food was of a high quality. We particularly enjoyed the Lamb Tagine dish but all the food was excellent.    It was very relaxing to lay on the large comfortable beds around the pool.    My wife really enjoyed the complimentary spa treatment that came as part of our deal.    In fact we liked everything except the prices feeling that even locally sourced food and drink was expensive (about ¬£5 for a 250ml bottle of local beer!).

The staff were not friendly or at all helpful. The reception staff were too busy on Facebook to give you the time of day. I asked one lady at reception for help and she left the reception desk not even informing me that she will be back. After waiting for 15 minutes we got fed up and retired to the lounge area only to find her there smoking with another member of staff. Some members of staff were quite hostile and this level of service ruined out stay. The gym equipment doesn't work. The breakfast has no variety at all.

Such a great experience and I would definitely recommend this hotel.  Slight negative points which in my eyes if improved would make this a five star gem.  I was really pleased that the hotel had a gym as this is something that swayed me it booking the hotel against a couple of other options.  The gym consists of 3 machines.A bikerunning machine and cross trainer.Given the hotel is only 3 years old I assumed the equipment would be relatively modern and workable.the equipment really is on its last legs and only one machine worked.this didn't really for with the hotel as looks like someone had dragged out some old tat for their garage 20 years ago and dumped it there.  The shuttle I think could be a little more frequent.after 7.30pm there isn't another shuttle in until 10.30pm.I think during the popular times there should be a bit more regular.to pay fora private pick up it is 20 euros.Making a return trip out for dinner if you don't allow the shuttle timetable 40 euros.this is expensive for Morocco.  Positive things which is mostly everything.rooms are really spacious with private gardens and sunloungers.  Really comfortable daybeds around the pool.it is also nice and peaceful with a real boutique feel.food is excellent and actually if you didn't want to then you really don't need to leave the hotel.  There is a really cosy feel to the place and the owner and staff are really lovely and helpful.  I have some business out in Marrakech next month so think I will rebook this hotel.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Peejdj wrote a review Apr 2013,40,Relaxing stay in beautiful surroundings,We spent a week at the Sirayane after deciding we wanted to go somewhere with sunshine and a chilled out atmosphere. The Sirayane proved to be an excellent choice. It was raining when we arrived but for the rest of the week it was mainly sunny although cloudy at times. We made use of the pick up service to get to and from the airport which was good value at about ¬£15 each way.    THE ROOM  We had a garden room which was spacious with a lovely walk in shower and a large flat screen TV. The bed was a bit too hard for our tastes and we both ended up with backache by the end of the week but then we had spent a long time lazing around on the double sunbeds.We didn't really use the garden because we were only steps away from the pool area. Curiously though there was no coffee available in the room only tea. The mini bar wasn't regularly replenished and the bottled water in the room when we arrived wasn't replenished.    POOL AREA  Neither of us used the pool itself but the area around was spotless and there was always a member of staff on standby to help move your umbrella if you wanted shade. There were large pillows as well and free towels as well and you could order drinks. It was wonderfully quiet and relaxing with a view of the snow covered Atlas mountains.    RESTAURANT/FOOD  We were bed and breakfast but also ate lunch and dinner in the main restaurant. We were a bit disappointed with the breakfasts and they didn't compare as well with other places we have stayed. For example there was no wholemeal/brown bread or bacon and the sausages didn't look particularly appetising. We ended up just having toast with scrambled eggs. They did make omelettes to order though. The lunch choice was great and we mainly went off the a la carte menu for dinner. Frustratingly on three occasions the main course I wanted wasn't available but the other options were just as good. A three course meal on the a la carte menu including a bottle of wine costs about ¬£70 but it was as good as any good quality restaurant I've been to. Some people have commented on here about the cost of drinks but we found it comparable with what we pay at home - about ¬£14 for a bottle of wine and ¬£4 for a reasonably large glass. The bar area was modern contemporary and chilled out.    OUT AND ABOUT  We made use of the shuttle service on a couple of occasions. It was reliable and quick and dropped off in the Medina. The hotel arranged the hire of a guide for half a day to take us around the souks which was good value (¬£30) and really helpful to get out bearings - we would have got hopelessly lost without him. If you want to eat out you are better heading to the new town in a taxi. We were glad we didn't stay in the centre - far too busy noisy and not relaxing at all!    SPA  We both had a massage which was fairly good value at ¬£40. My wife had a hamann but thought the steam room was a bit grubby and didn't think it was worth the money.    SERVICE  We couldn't fault the service. From the moment we arrived it was absolutely first class. A member of staff took time to sit us down and show us around and give us details of the cost of trips. Throughout our stay staff were helpful and courteous and service was swift. In fact my only complaint would be that it got a bit tiring being asked if everything was OK. The owner makes a habit of speaking to guests up to twice a day to check if they are happy with everything and to be honest we got a bit sick of it as we had nothing to say to him.    GUESTS  We hoped it would be fairly quiet and so it proved to be. There were a couple of families with young children who stayed for a couple of nights but they didn't really bother us. Mainly the guests were couples - a mix of English French and Spanish ranging in age from 20s to 60s. Most spent the day lounging round the pool quietly topping up their tan while using ereaders or ipads. We even witnessed one young couple using an ipad while having dinner in the restaurant - what a conversation killer!    OVERALL  This is a great place to stay. It is not the cheapest (budget around ¬£100 per couple per day if you want to eat and drink there) but it is a tranquil place to stay away from the hustle and bustle of the city. I haven't given it five stars for some of the reasons outlined but it wasn't far off.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Wirral,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Peejdj

The weather was changeable but we managed to enjoy the private garden and and sunbeds for one whole day! The rooms were amazing with tv and a selection of dvds a lovely big shower head in the wet room and everything you could want. On arrival we also enjoyed a selection of local biscuits and a tour from the staff member who checked us in.    The free shuttle into the main square was always easy to book and on time. The staff were all very friendly but not intrusive which they can be when you are 2 women travelling together in that area. The spa was amazing and we booked further treatments alongside the free Hammam because we were so impressed. I can recommend the hot stone massage!    The breakfast was extensive and tasty. The sausage onion and tomato dish was great so give it a try. There was a cooked breakfast selection along side cakes pastries fruit yogurt cereals and cheese/meats. There were also about 10 different fruit and vegetable juices. We also ate in the restaurant for 3 nights and the tagines and local dishes were all very high quality. We also ate the mixed grill from the lunch menu and it was very well presented and tasty.    When we found a shop in the souq that we wanted to return to the staff phoned and arranged for someone to meet us at the square and walk us to it as it is such a maze!

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,nagindth wrote a review Mar 2013,40,Great place to enjoy the winter sun,bad bits first - the complimentary moroccan pastry which was kept in the room was v. old smelt of bad oil. However we only told them on the last day that it was lying there and not fit to be eaten.  Secondly it is annoying to have the wonderful mint tea on arrival and then to pay premium price for it anytime after that (its atleast 3 times more expensive than the medina). Thirdly same for the orange juice (which can be plentiful at free breakfast but anyother time you pay 4 times more than Djemna El Fna). however it is still reasonably priced compared to UK.    We had the misfortune of room 105 - try and avoid that as there is no sun in your balcony ever no great views plus some wierd banging sounds at 6.20 am in the morning atleast 3 times during our 4 night stay. it only lasts for 10-20 minutes but enough to wake you up. also it is on the top of the spa which has its own noises.    Best bits - imposing entrance comfortable and made to feel good check-in. smart and friendly staff who were well attentive. clean rooms and public places. FREE WIFI ALL AROUND. even at the pool. plus a desktop computer in the library (most were french books but some english were there).  Food - what we ate was tasty plentiful. price was that of London's (including the 10% service charge). cocktails were the same. the free breakfast is great - dont forget to ask for your omelette's. sometimes the sign goes missing and anyway its in french.    Poolside was amazing. view towards the atlas mountains comfortable beds and a poolside attendant on duty always. no real rush or competition for the beds. 1 normal and a smaller temperature controlled pool.    Check out was smooth - allowed us to stay and use the facilities for 5 hours until our pick up arrived.  if we go to Marrakech again we will definitely consider staying here again.  (the shuttle is only 15 min to the city - you have to prebook atleast 2 hours before.)  for the Hammam - similar price will give you an amazing experience in the medina - see my other review.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nagindth

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,nandgNL wrote a review Mar 2013,50,peaceful away from the souks,the Sirayane as in other reviews is an excellent place to stay. the staff are friendly and helpful. the owner and manager regularly walk around to ask how everyting is.  The hotel is outside the city. this is perfect if you are wanting to combine visiting Marrakech with a chance to relax. The hotel is a modern design minimalist in comparison to the normal Morroccan styling. The pool area has comfortable beds and is quiet (no loud music during our stay). we had a suite with private pool which enhance the getaway feeling.  There is a free shuttle bus into the city which was always on time. Booking is needed.  Hotel food was very good. The evening menu was not anymore expensive than a good quality restaurant in the city. The menu did not change. The lunch menu was more restricted and a little more expensive for essentially a sandwich with chips.  worth taking a trip into the Atlas mountains. The hotel can arrange this. If you can share this with 2 others (4 in total) is the cost good value.  Wifi in all rooms though sometimes variable in quality.  If you are going to Maarakech for a few days and just want to see the sights a hotel (or Riad) in the centre is probably a better choice but worth the extra few days to combine with a relax and the Sirayane is then a good choice. Very peaceful with few sounds in the morning other than the birds. well worth a stay!,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nandgNL

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,baronio wrote a review Mar 2013,50,Relaxing small luxury hotel,We stayed for four nights as part of a Travelzoo/Fleetway Travel deal which was excellent value. The hotel provides a calm and peaceful holiday base which is a stark contrast to the hubbub of the centre of Marrakesh. There are only 28 rooms so it provides a personal service especially because the owner makes a point of greeting guests daily and asking if they are enjoying their holiday.  The Sirayane is spacious modern and well designed the staff extremely friendly and helpful and facilities very good. We had a mini suite with a small private garden few steps away from the pools (one heated in winter one unheated). I had a hammam which was a treat. Breakfast was excellent and the free shuttle bus into the centre of Marrakesh was useful and reliable - we used it daily.  A few very minor quibbles: the girls in the spa are helpful but speak little English unlike the rest of the staff. On checking out we had to pay local and city taxes (about the equivalent of ¬£20). It would have been useful to have been warned about this. Otherwise a great hotel.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Knutsford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/baronio

The staff were helpful and met all our needs .The shuttle bus was great always punctual and made our visits to Marrakesh easyenabling us to see all the joys of busy Marrakesh without the hassle of negotiating fares with local taxi drivers! The hotel was a haven of peace and we enjoyed lazing on the superb sun beds around the pool.Dining at the hotel was first class with a great choice and attentive service.The owner makes sure that he meets his guests and is very friendly staff are well trained and nothing is too much trouble for them Staff spoke arabic.french an english and communication was easy we booked our airport transfers via email and could not fault this service.This was our first visit to Marrakech and we highly recommend this hotel and we intend to return..,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Lincoln, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/berilldon

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Joanne R wrote a review Mar 2013,50,Perfect!,This hotel is wonderful. You are made to feel welcome from the minute you enter the incredibly large door to reception. We had a standard room (105) with a balcony which was a good size and wonderfully decorated abd furnished. You could stand in the shower and look out towards Marrakech.  Breakfast has everything you could wish for including around 7 different fruit juices all freshly squeezed. The pool area was well layed out and had great views of the mountains.  The spa was very good. I have the Hamman with scrub and a facial which I would highly recommend.  We enjoyed the free shuttle service to Marrakech - make sure you book and you'll be fine. It's only about a 15 minute drive and they were always on time.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,JackieM1983 wrote a review Mar 2013,50,Gorgeous Hotel,"We stayed in one of the suites with a private garden leading onto the swimming pools. Our room was spacious and tastefully decorated and we enjoyed the ""towel art"" and flower petals which were scattered on the bed and bathroom. The private garden complete with sun loungers was lovely - a sun trap and a nice retreat when the pool was busy.    The hotel is some distance from the medina however they offer a free shuttle service which goes several times daily (you must book) and we also used their shuttle service for airport transfers.    There is a good spa where we got hammams and massages which we'd recommend. We also took advantage of the DVDs you could loan from the hotel free of charge - a nice way to spend the evening when you are tired from excursions.    The owner takes the time to walk around the hotel and meet the guests which was appreciated. In general the hotel has a nice ambience and the staff are exceptionally friendly.    The highlight for us was probably playing tennis while we watched the sun set over the Atlas mountains. All the sunsets were particularly stunning with gorgeous colours and beautiful beautiful views. We also really enjoyed sitting in the quiet room in the evenings - with its large roaring log fire it is also a gorgeous place to sit and enjoy a quiet glass of Moroccan wine.",Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackieM1983
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,holswelove wrote a review Mar 2013,40,A secluded retreat,"Having been given a four day break at this hotel we were a little apprehensive as we are not the sort of people that do either ""boutique"" or ""spa"" hotels.  The entrance to the hotel is very impressive and on arrival we were given some mint tea which was very refreshing. Our mini suite was well appointed with a small private garden complete with loungers. The bathroom was well equipped with toiletries robes slippers and hair dryer. The water was hot every day although we found the bed very hard.  Breakfast was more than adequate for our needs with a good variety of hot dishes juices bread and cake.  The dinner menus were limited and could have done with proper English translations instead of Franglaise but the waiters were very helpful in describing the dishes. The food was very tasty and well cooked and we thought good value for money.  We used the transport provided to visit the centre one day which was as stated.  We did not use the spa facilities so cannot comment on them.  We found the staff very attentive and helpful. When the electrics failed in our room one evening the response was immediate and the problem resolved within 15 minutes.  The helpfulness was further demonstrated by their actions in resolving the issue of our airport transfer not showing up on the day of our departure (which was supposed to have been provided by Fleetway Travel via their agents Atlas).  The hotel does not change money you can do this on your arrival at the airport or once in town at the Hotel Ali  across the gardens from the drop off point.  The hotel does not sell postage stamps but are happy to arrange for the posting of cards at 10 dirhams each.  The bringing in of food and drink from outside is strictly forbidden so don't bring a bottle of your favourite nightcap from home.  To summarise we found the hotel and service very good. However when we return to Marrakech we will stay in a hotel closer to the centre.",Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Milton Keynes,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/holswelove
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,lovelife22 wrote a review Mar 2013,40,More than we expected.,What could be better than waking up to a view of the Atlas mountains? As other reviewers have commented this is a beautiful hotel with exceptional service. We had room 103 in the main buiding on the first floor which gave the best mountain views both from the room and from our large balcony. However I would not recommend this room to anyone slightly unsure on their feet or with limited night vision. The entire hotel is made of stone including the floors and steps. The corridor leading to room 103 is only dimly lit at night and I fell on the stone steps seriously bruising both legs. I reported this to the owner and he wanted me to show him where I had fallen but then just said no one had complained about the dim lighting before. As he was so attentive to all guests I did expect him to enquire about my legs the next day but he did not make any other reference to my accident.  Great breakfast but we only dined once at the hotel. My meat-eating daughter found the food excellent but as a vegetarian the choice was limited for me and on the expensive side although beautifully presented.  Good shuttle service and friendly drivers but set times so you had to be specific about your arrangements and plan in advance which might not be what you want to do on holiday.  We loved relaxing on the spacious sun loungers but it wasn't warm enough to use the pool. We both had a hammam and a massage which we enjoyed and the staff in the spa were just as attentive as elsewhere.  All in all we throughly enjoyed our stay. This hotel is a great contrast to the medina and provides a safe and restful atmosphere. Should we return to Marrakech I would consider coming back to this hotel. I might be more inclined to if they changed the menu.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovelife22
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Stuart Q wrote a review Mar 2013,50,Excellent Boutique Hotel,We stayed here on a four night Travelzoo break and were very pleased with the choice of hotel. The Sirayane is 8km from Marrakech centre which makes it a wonderful oasis away from the hustle and bustle of the Medina. There is a shuttle service which runs six times a day to the main square and was always on time it takes around 15 minutes on the couple of occasions when the ten-seater shuttle was overbooked another was put on without question (Tip - book your shuttle don't just turn up). Everything about the hotel worked well and was first rate including the spa my only comment would be that in the evenings the (exceptionally good) restaurant only serves two or three course table d'hote meals. We would have liked the option of something a little lighter on the days we had eaten well at lunchtime.,Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Ilkley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StuartQ_13
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Enamelina wrote a review Mar 2013,40,Ultra Cool - caring owner,La Sirayane    If you have been staying in the Medina of Marrakech as we had the ultra cool modernity of this hotel along with its remote and bleak position is a bit of a culture shock after the highly decorative environment of the city. If you come here straight from the plane you won‚Äôt be affected in this way and will start to relax straight away.  We booked a suite with a private pool. The suite was spacious comfortable with two larges TV‚Äôs and dvd players. The bathroom was light and airy with a Jacuzzi bath and a separate shower which was super. The bed was comfortable and there was a kettle for making tea and coffee. We got milk from the bar and kept it in the fridge.They couldn‚Äôt believe we wanted milk in our tea!!!! Take you own teabags unless you want to drink only mint tea.  We had a huge garden with an excellent pool it was a really good size and it was deliciously warm. There was a cover to put on every night to keep the heat in ‚Äì the nights were very cold at the beginning of February. In this hotel they have the most comfortable double sunbeds and there was one in our garden along with other furniture. This suite was definitely worth the cost and once we were there we didn‚Äôt really leave it having had several days in Marrakech already we gave any sights we hadn‚Äôt seem a miss and enjoyed our pool as we were only there for 2 days.  The hotels main pool area is rather clever; it is sunken so you are out of any wind. There are two pools one is heated and that is where everyone swam while we were there. The other pool is very large and as there are only about 28 rooms there would be space for everyone at busy times in summer. Around it are the very comfortable double sunbeds and an excellent pool attendant to hand out and arrange the huge towels for you.  We were disappointed with breakfast it didn‚Äôt seem in keeping with its 5 star status and we found it difficult to find something we wanted to eat. Cereals were stale on our first morning but when we pointed this out to the owner they were changed the following morning Birds flew in and pecked at the food and the one domestic toaster was inadequate. There was however an impressive array of juices.  Dinner was better. An extensive menu but if you are there for any length of time don‚Äôt expect tit to change. There is no description of any dish and no tasting notes with the wine list. The wines are largely Moroccan and unfamiliar to most of us. There was quite a choice for dinner and a separate menu for traditional Moroccan dishes. And the food wasn‚Äôt bad. Service was good but not that crisp 5 star service you would get in the UK.  Music plays in the public areas sometimes this was too loud and annoyed some people more than others. After having louder live music at our previous hotel we didn‚Äôt find it too intrusive but it is nice to have quiet sometimes.  We would stay here again especially if we could have the same suite and would highly recommend it.  We didn‚Äôt eat in the restaurant at lunch time but ordered a snack from room service to eat by our pool. This arrived quickly and was still hot (our suite was the furthest away from the restaurant).  The owner came and spoke to customers one evening at dinner while we were there. He is trying so hard to get everything right so this hotel can only get even better. We had a couple of concerns (no turn down one evening etc.) he took note and addressed everything he could. He was very kind and helpful and we wish him continued success in his hotel.  We didn‚Äôt use the free shuttle bus service to the Medina but this seemed an excellent service and most people took advantage of it. For all that I have said about the initial impression of the hotel on us it can‚Äôt have been that bad as we didn‚Äôt leave it. We enjoyed our suite and our pool and our time there and providing we can have the same suite again would love to go back.  Oh and sunsets‚Ä¶we saw the most spectacular one while we were there.,Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,South Coast,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Enamelina

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,tiggeronoverdrive wrote a review Feb 2013,50,"Stylish, wonderfull staff, soo comfortable",We went to the Sirayane on an offer simply to relax. Having been to Marrakesh many times before we weren't particularly interested in going into town more than once. The first impressions are great. Huge entrance with dramatic doors. Welcoming staff who couldn't do too much for you. I had gone without any hair ties and a lovely girl called Mirriam went out to buy some for me (which I forgot to pay her for I am ashamed to admit!). There are two pools the smaller of which is heated - which you do need as the temperature drops dramatically in the evening. The sun beds are square so you (or the helpful pool boys) can move the pillows around so that you can face the sun. There are olive trees and umbrellas if you want to keep out of the sun though. Light lunches surprisingly good house wine. The rooms are quite lovely with smart power showers and private gardens. We only used the spa once and again the staff were kind and helpfull. Dinner is a bit more formal which is a good excuse to dress up a bit. Breakfast - fantastic. I have never seen so many choices of juices. I really don't think I could recommend it more for the price and time of year.,Date of stay: January 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Kingsbridge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tiggeronoverdrive
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Barry S wrote a review Feb 2013,50,Superb oasis away from the hubbub,The Sirayane is a beautiful small hotel with excellent facilities and a good quality (though not cheap) restaurant the staff are friendly and attentive and a credit to the owner who ensures he makes time to speak to his guests.    Our room with private garden (most have this) was well-appointed with large king bed and en-suite with separate shower and toilet. Everything was kept spotlessly clean.    The pool area is a real treat with comfortable double loungers so you don't have the usual crowd of sun beds. Again the pool attendant was very keen to help with parasol position etc and the waiters on hand for drinks.    For us key to the location was the 15-minute drive from the bustle of the Medina which meant we could completely relax away from it all yet still experience this fascinating city and all it has to offer. The shuttle service was spot on you just have to make sure you book your times and a minibus is available - the only potential negative being the inflexible set times but this didn't worry us.

When you meet the owner Mr Mehdi and it is almost certain you willyou will realise how much time effort training and needless to say money and experience have gone in to making Sirayane a class act which could be hard to beat. Less than 15 minutes from the airport but no noise from planes. As far as we could see all rooms are to a high quality of both comfort and style. Food standards and hygiene to a very high level indeed. European and Moroccan style food is the order of the day with two seperate top chefs in action. The staff always trying to make sure you get everything you want in the way of serviceadvice and local information. The minibus service to and from Marrakech centre is invaluable and included in the package. We arrived at the end of January to 27 degrees and it stayed like that for 5 days.

Great loungers and poolsone actually heated spacious comfortable bedroom and excellent helpful staff. Nothing was too much trouble. Although the hotel is tucked away down a very long winding lane there were several free and prompt shuttle buses to take you in and out of the centre of Marrakech.  Only downside was the small archaic toaster for around fifty guests and the interminable and ghastly muzak that began at 9.30am and continued throughout the site for the whole day. Fortunately a wink at any staff member would get your nearest speaker switched off instantly. Still lots of grumbles about it from the guests. Breakfast was excellent dinner OK.

This hotel is an oasis of calm in a mad city. Its isolated location is a bonus for those who really do want to get away from it all and enjoy some winter sun but the complimentary shuttle bus ensures that you can get your fix of the hussle and bussle of Marrakech and the Medina when required.  Helpful and kind staff are there to ensure that you have a comfortable stay nothing is too much trouble. Guided visits to the Mountains and the city site are well organised using great local guides who are keen to show the wonders of their city and culture to the tourist.  We stayed in a really comfortable room with great bed linen and a small garden.  The food was good with a wide choice of local or international dishes and the bar prices are what you would expect for a hotel of this star rating.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,ArsenalKel wrote a review Jan 2013,40,"Relaxing, peaceful, comfortable stay.",We have just come back from a 4 night stay here. The hotel is a 15-20minute drive from town this may sound not ideal but to us it was perfect as we had a great view of the atlas mountains and it was nice and quiet unlike the town which is constantly busy. The hotel does provide a free shuttle bus into the town with a number of times to choose from only downside is that you have to let them know what bus you will be on on return which can be a pain as you are not always sure what time you will be back. They could do with being more often as we missed it once and had to pay the ?20 cab fare. The hotel is nice clean and modern. There is a nice bar area and relaxing reading area with a fire place which is needed in the winter evenings and a selction of book/dvds. The food is very good at the hotel big portions we had lunch a few times and dinner too- would recommend the moroccan dinner menu! The alcohol prices are expensive (?30 for a bottle of wine) but these prices are the same everywhere in marrakech. We went to the spa too we had a hamman which was ok- dont think i would do it again. But also had the oriental massage and can honestly say it was the best massage i have ever had. The staff are very polite and do make your stay more comfortable. There are a few outstanding waiters (unfortunately i did not catch their name) which could help give this place 5*. I think there is room for improvement there was no assistance from the hotel in helping us make the most of our holiday. For instance we never got offered a map of the city or any recommendations on what to do or where to eat. There were no books in our room to provide such information either and the staff were maybe not so friendly in freely offering this advice. However i must say that the owner dows take very good care of his customers he takes time during the day and evening to go round everyone and make sure we are all ok and that the staff are helping us. All in all this hotel is outstanding the rooms were large staff were polite pool area is rwlaxing and the food is lovely. Would definitly go back again- only gave 4* for the minor issues i raised would have given 5 if not.,,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArsenalKel

This is a lovely retreat with so much to enjoy. We came with our teenage sons and they enjoyed the pool the tennis and the gym. We loved the hamman spa treatment. There is a wide diversity of staff and all are so friendly and nothing is too much trouble - we enjoyed the ritual of the bed turning down service (we liked the swan best!). The shuttle service means that you can be in the centre in 20 minutes but can relax on the terrace overlooking the pool for a very decent breakfast beforehand.  We stayed in the hotel for a meal on New Year's Eve. The owner said it had taken 6 weeks to plan and we could believe it. It was meticulously planned - fire eaters belly dancers Berber drummers and dancers - oh and the food was amazing too.  We have returned feeling very relaxed and a bit chubbier. Do visit Marrakech but stay in the Sirayane. The owner is striving for continuous improvement but there is little left to improve.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Gillian D wrote a review Jan 2013,50,Smiles all round!,This was our first time in Morocco and our first time abroad at Christmas and we feel very lucky to have stayed at the Sirayane. The other writers are correct about the welcome you get and Simo and Miriam are worth a mention for their excellent customer service attitude and helpful information. The most outstanding feature of our stay was indeed the friendly welcome you get from all the staff not just reception management restaurant and bar staff but also cleaners gardeners and security staff. Everyone smiles and says hello! The rooms are spacious and comfortable with lots of space in the bathroom (a washbasin each) and shower area. There is also a nice feature of rose petals and towel arrangements as part of your turn down service. The so-called half board food is outstanding for the price paid. It is actually an a la carte menu with a wide range of both Moroccan and European cuisine everything from Moroccan salads and lamb tagine to fillet mignon or seafood. Seriously consider this option unless you intend to get the shuttle into the city every night. The bar and lounge areas are very comfortable and the pre-dinner drinks come with a nice variety of nibbles. The breakfast buffet is also wide ranging decent quality and caters for all tastes. The environment is instantly tranquil and you will relax the moment you arrive. The Hamam and full body massage are excellent value compared with similar services in 5 star hotels and conducted professionally although you will need to do your own health check as there is no pre-treatment questionnaire. The owner Mehdi walks the walk several times a day and is genuinely interested in your feedback for quality improvement. The architecture is fascinating and the layout of the premises makes you feel that you have the place to yourself. We stayed in the main hotel and had an excellent room with a corner balcony which gives you a great view over the grounds and beyond to the beautiful Atlas Mountains. There is a path around the perimeter which some people used for an early morning jog. Around the main pool are excellent quality king sized sun beds which add to the feeling of luxury. Overall a tranquil oasis where the ambience helps all the guests to relax and be respectful of their environment and each other.

We were met at the airport with no problems and met with tea and a very warm welcome at the hotel. Our bags were taken to our rooms and we settled in very quickly. The rooms are lovely we had one which overlooked the pool and a second that was on the first floor with a balcony. Both were great. The towels were formed like swans and rose petals scattered everywhere. Our rooms were cleaned really well every day and while we were at supper turned down and petals or a rose put on our beds. The beds were really comfortable. The food was lovely we ate from both menus and they were very willing to change things slightly for my daughter when we asked. Nothing was too much trouble. The hotel put on a special evening for Christmas Eve which was very thoughtful and a surprise - they organised some musicians and a belly dancer which was fun. The owner and manager spoke to us each day to ask if everything was okay. The reception staff were a delight and the staff at the pool and around the gardens were working hard all the time. We were always greated with a smile and hello whenever we passed any member of staff. The hotel was a little way out of the centre but the shuttle bus worked well and we used it alot and it was quite a haven to return to after a busy day out. We did a trip to the Atlas Mountains and the hotel arranged a great guide but the one thing that was not made clear was that we were to pay the guide directly (rather than the trip being added to the bill) and we didn't have enough money for that so it meant getting some money out of the ATM at the airport. It was a lovely stay - thank you very much.,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,Bournemouth,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/harryh52
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,susanmcdnld wrote a review Dec 2012,50,Fantastic,Cannot praise the customer service too highly! Nothing was too much bother and everyone was delighted to help. The free shuttle runs until quite late at night so is convenient for dinner in town although not very frequent in the afternoons. The hotel location is away from the bustle if you want to chill out. All in all the best hotel I've ever stayed in and I cannot recommend it too highly.,Date of stay: November 2012,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanmcdnld
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Naylah wrote a review Dec 2012,50,Beautiful!!!!,We spent 3 amazing nights at the Sirayane. After reading all the reviews on tripadvisor I thought they were too good to be true but the hotel and the staff lived up to the excellent reviews. The staff were very helpful and nothing asked was too much trouble for them to accommodate. It was the best place to spend my husband's 30th birthday. Could not think of a better place to have celebrated it. The free shuttle service is an excellent perk and a very good service. The food is excellent and a wide variety offered at the breakfast buffet. The spa is truly amazing and would recommend the hammam and full body massage; the spa staff were very professional and friendly which again goes for all the staff at the hotel.  Wish we could have stayed longer which hopefully we will incorporate into our next visit.  Once again thank you very much to all at Sirayane for a beautiful stay. It was truly an excellent experience. We would both definitely come back and stay at the Sirayane hopefully in the near future.,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Walsall, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Naylah

The only reason why it's not getting an excellent is because an hourly rather than a 3 hours shuttle buses transfers to town is needed. If not you are spending 20 Euro each way which can very quickly add up.  Having said that the breakfast selection was fab we had dinner at the hotel and the portions were more than enough.  The spa just smelt heavenly and the ladies there made us feel so relaxed after all our treatments.,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pay75
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Lori S wrote a review Dec 2012,50,EXQUISITE GEM OF A HOTEL!!!!,I recently stayed at this wonderful hotel by recommendation of a friend. From the moment we arrived at this beautifully designed and zen hotel the service was amazing....as we exited the taxi from the airport we were greeted at the driveway and led to a serene sitting area in the lobby and served tea while we were checked in. The entire staff (especially Bader) was very professional and attentive to our every need from recommendations arranging taxi dinner reservations. The shuttle into town was so convenient always on time and with enough room for us. Most impressive was meeting and talking with the owner who was always inquiring about our stay and if our expectations were being met...such an interesting and personable man who is delightful to talk to. The breakfast buffet (which was included in the room rate) overlooking the beautiful infinity pool and perfectly manicured grounds was extensive and delicious with a vast array of foods and very creative fresh squeezed fruit juices daily. Dinner was very good also. The hammam scrub and massages in the gorgeous spa were amazing. Wish we could have stayed longer. Thank you to the entire staff for a fabulous stay; one we will never forget.

The level of service from beginning to end was outstanding!! From my initial enquiries to Hanane and Lamya who couldn't have been more professional providing every assistance politely and efficiently to arriving and receiving a level of service rarely experienced anywhere else!! The staff in this hotel are what make the difference their attention to detail and customer care is first class. Whilst mentioning a few names that is not to say they weren't all excellent. Jalil Ghoni Anas Siad Salah and Sonia all quite amazing so professional you never had to ask twice and they provided a quality of customer care second to none. The other very personal touch was the owners concern that your expectations were being met at all levels through his hotel. He regularly came to find us concerned that everything was as we wanted and that his team were providing a good service. Such a refreshing approach and lesson so many hotel owners the world over could take lessons in. He is incredibly proud of his hotel and rightly so!! The gardens are manicured the pool area relaxing and so comfortable good restaurant great food lovely bar rooms of a high standard the Hammam was so good my wife couldn't stop going back!! We without doubt will be back. This hotel is a oasis of peace and tranquillity the perfect location to recharge your batteries!!

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Fastflight wrote a review Nov 2012,40,Comfortable environment and friendly service,I pre-arranged a transfer from the airport which worked perfectly and was well worth the money in my view. Even though the airport is not far away why worry about saving a bit of money on a taxi when you can be picked up in a spacious comfortable people carrier?    When we arrived our bags were discreetly taken to our room whilst we checked in and were given some mint tea which was a nice touch. Then we were given a brief tour of the hotel and the grounds before being shown our room. My wife was very impressed with the fact that as new arrivals fresh rose petals (presumably gathered from the hotel‚Äôs own rose garden) had been liberally sprinkled around the bedroom and bathroom area ‚Äì another nice touch. In fact the housekeeping standards were extremely good ‚Äì the room was kept spotlessly clean throughout our stay and there was turn-down every evening without fail.    Our room was very well equipped with fridge large shower room and toilet area flat screen TV with DVD player and one of the largest and most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. The d√©cor is very tasteful and (unlike an earlier reviewer) I liked the almost minimalist style throughout the hotel which for me worked perfectly.    As other reviewers have pointed out the hotel runs a shuttle bus service in and out of town that you can book a time slot for. We found it very efficient and always on time. It generally takes around 10-15 minutes to get into the centre of town.    The food was pretty good on the whole. There was a good selection of different items on offer at breakfast including an imaginative selection of fresh fruit juices. For dinner I felt that the Moroccan dishes were generally better than those on the international menu although the Fillet steak was of exceptionally good quality and the Chocolate Fondant was very good too.    Some of the wines looked a bit expensive although we found the lower priced Moroccan wines (both Red and White) to be very palatable and good value for money.    There appears to be quite a high staff to customer ratio in the restaurant and the service was friendly and efficient without being intrusive and the ambience was nice and relaxing. I would have preferred more ethnic music to be played in the background however rather than the Eagles Stevie Wonder etc. that seemed to be the standard offering but I suppose that‚Äôs just a matter of personal taste.    The owner of the hotel makes a point of greeting the guests most days enquiring as to how they are enjoying their stay and I believe that he is genuinely interested in hearing their feedback in order to maintain standards. Early in our stay I had discovered a fault with the DVD player in our room. I reported this to reception who said they would send someone to fix it but no one appeared. I mentioned this to the owner later that day and within minutes a maintenance man appeared and replaced the defective unit with a new one.    Room service didn‚Äôt quite live up to the generally high standards evident elsewhere. We ordered omelettes and coffee in our room and they took a long time and were not very hot when they arrived. (The room service waiter admitted that he‚Äôd forgotten the room number which probably explains why.)    The hotel grounds are very pleasant and well maintained by the small army of gardeners and you actually get what you see on the hotel‚Äôs website. The Atlas Mountains provide a wonderful backdrop to the hotel pools. The lighting in the grounds at night is very effective too.    If you want a relaxing place to stay that provides a personal friendly service away from the hubbub of the Medina then you won‚Äôt be disappointed with this hotel.,Date of stay: November 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Amersham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fastflight

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Deberes wrote a review Nov 2012,40,A relaxing stay,We were looking for a few days late winter sun - which on the whole delivered - and our choice of hotel did not disappoint. We agree with some other reviews that in our experience the hotel merited 4 stars. The presence of management was encouraging. Being admittedly fussy food-wise we experienced both the Moroccan and International menu at dinner andcbothcenoyed the foremost - although you need to be aware that the lamb and apricot tagine is just that - if you would like an accompaniment such as rice or couscous then you have to ask for it - however that was never a problem! Lunchtime on the terrace with a bottle or rose was superb.  The Hammam was very relaxing - we didn't know what to expect as this was our first time - but felt very refreshed afterwards. Our room (101 on the first floor of the main hotel) was a corner room so had views over the pool towards the Atlas Mountains but also we loved looking across to Marrakech over the scrubland where goats grazed and children played in a huge olive tree.,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Devon, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deberes

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,gloriajones wrote a review Nov 2012,40,5 stars staff but not a 5***** hotel,My husband and I spent fours days at the Sirayane hotel and we were impressed with the attentive staff. I wasn't well the first night we arrived and they did their utmost to assist me in any way they could.  Breakfast was good but not enough attentions to details was paid to ensure a 5 stars standard. The same can be said for the hotel in general they try really hard but there is certainly room for improvement. It's more a four stars than a five although the hotel is new it looks like it was finished in a hurry or maybe it was a lack of money?  The water of the pool was really cold so it was not ideal if you like to go for a swim. One of the two pools (the small one) is usually heated but it wasn't when we were there in mid October.  We had dinner one night and the food was good but not outstanding and there is not much choice it s much more fun to go out and dine in the Medina.  There is a shuttle service that takes the guests to the Medina and it's free (it takes around 15 minutes).  To get to the airport is 20 Euros each way which I think is rather overpriced as the airport is just around the corner and it's the same price whether is for one or two persons.  The Spa is nice we had an hamman and a massage. The hamman was really good but I was unimpressed with the massage definitely not worth the money.  They have a good selection of DVDs at the reception and they can be rented for free. Also wi fi is available everywhere in the hotel.  On the whole ours was a positive experience we would definitely recommend this hotel just don't expect a five stars experience.,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Oxford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gloriajones
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,CemalT608 wrote a review Oct 2012,50,Amazing Hotel,When I was reading the reviews for the hotel before our holiday I said to myself it cannot be that good but it was and more. Excellent hotel with 5 star hotel and service. We spent 4 days in the hotel during september and I would recommend this hotel to anyone. During the day we relaxed around the pool which is constantly serviced by the staff for drinks or simply moving your umbrella. We also used the tennis court and gym twice so there is always something to do. My girlfriend also had a spa treatment which she very much enjoyed so theres plenty to do if you want to have a lazy day around the hotel trust me you wont get bored. As the the member of staff said to me the main attraction is the pool and he is definitly right it is an amazing view and very relaxing during the day with gentle music in the background.    We also had breakfast lunch and on occasion dinner in the hotel which was good quality. On my first night I had the fillet steak with mash potato which was very good and would not be out of place in london in terms of the taste and quality of the food. The portions are very generous.    The hotel has an excellent shuttle service to the main part of marrakech (medina) which runs 5-6 services there and back a day at certain times which is always punctual. This service is very handy as it saves on taxis and very reliable. Duration to town is around 20mins and is a pleasant drive past the palace and newly built properties.    So much to say but not enough room to fit it all in haha. The owner Mehdi also introduced himself to us and was very attentive to our needs just like all of the staff at the hotel they trully posses a 5 star service.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,AronT wrote a review Oct 2012,50,Excellent retreat away from the hustle and bustle,WOW    Before we left the UK we contacted the hotel to arrange transportation from the Airport; it's worth arranging this directly with the hotel rather than having to deal with third party taxi drivers. The driver was excellent [had a sign took my wife's suitcase and made sure the car was cool before we got in] VERY VIP!    Upon arrival our bags were taken to our room whilst we enjoyed a Moroccan tea and snack welcome friendly staff introduced themselves and showed us around the hotel grounds.    We stayed in a Junior Suite with private pool Wonderful having our own private pool as well as having the opportunity to use the main pool. The pool person was very helpful at the main pool and we were able to order drinks and towels etc very easily.    We booked onto the free shuttle into town [10mins?] on a couple of days to go and see the city.    The room service food was top notch; and we had a fridge in our room. The hotel staff kept it topped up.    The on site restaurant was brilliant; serves a multinational menu so you can have dinner there over many nights and never have to order the same!    Breakfast at the hotel was A MA Z I N G! Such a wide variety of hot and cold options; there was also a rainbow of fresh juices to choose from.    TV in the room was what you'd expect on an international holiday; we took a couple of DVDs with us; a pleasant surprise to see the hotel also has a library of DVDs to choose from.    Free wifi in room and in public spaces; and the on site computer meant we weren't disconnected from the world completely.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,StuTheTourist wrote a review Oct 2012,50,We had a fantastic stay!,Stayed here for a week in mid-September and had a fantastic time.    Weather was excellent staff were very good and the owner was always on hand making sure everyone was OK.    Hotel room was very nice and big with all mod cons. Wife thought the bath towels were a bit small and we didn't have a loo roll holder but don't let that put you off!    Plenty of choice for breakfast lunch menu was varied and there was a good choice for dinner. My wife is a fussy vegetarian and that was the one disappointment they could do with more variety for veggies!    Shuttle bus into the Medina works very well and having now seen it I would definitely say stay at the Sirayane and get the bus into town rather than stay in a Ryad at the Medina to avoid the hassle and the heat and so that you can make the most of the pool.    In the past we have gone to the UAE for a week of sun but now we know Marrakesh is less than 4hrs from London and we know the service at the Sirayane is excellent we will definitely be going back.    If you need wheel chair access there are a couple of steps down to the pool. However the staff are more than happy to assist with carrying chairs up and down and I'm sure in due course they will build a ramp to make it easier. Please don't let this put you off just be aware of it and maybe check before booking.    In summary the staff were very genuine very polite and couldn't do enough for us. The hotel was brilliant and the weather great. If you are thinking about Marrakesh and want to do it in style definitely stay at the Sirayane!,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StuTheTourist

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,MrandMrsOomer wrote a review Oct 2012,50,A Morrocan Retreat off the beaten path.,This boutique hotel sets an example as to how a hotel should be run. My wife and I booked a week stay at the Sirayane over my Birthday and what we didnt realise was that we were in for a treat.    Location.    The location for us was perfect off the beaten path approximately 15-20 mins from the frantic hustle and bustle of the Medina and Jama el Fnaa square. We delibrately wanted to stay away from the centre and we were very glad that we did. The hotel does provide a fantastic well run complimentary shuttle service to get to and from the Medina which worked well for us. The shuttle was always on time and very reliable. The atmosphere at the hotel was very peaceful throughout. I would say this hotel is better suited for couples friends and solo travellers as opposed to families with young children. The decor of this hotel is modern with zen touches accompanied by subtle Morrocan themes which works really well.    Service    Service was Excellent. The staff have been professionally trained with special mentions to the restaurant staff who I thought were exceptional. Housekeeping was always done to a high standard and the front desk/ reception staff were always on hand if they were called upon.    Room.    We stayed in Room 118 a Junior Suite for the added privacy which boasted a private pool and garden which was very nice. The room was clean and comfortable. the bathroom was well laid out with a his and hers sink a jacuzzi bath and great quality bathrobes and slippers. The room had plenty of wardrobe space and hangers along with an electronic safe box. However it lacked an iron and ironing board (which is available on request). There is a flatscreen TV/ DVD player with limited English channels but there were a number of complimentary DVDs available on request. The Wifi signal in the room was a minor issue as it did disconnect occaisonally but other than that everything was perfect.    Food    I was greatly surprised at the quality of food that was on offer at this hotel. I pretty much thought everything I ordered off the lunch and dinner menu was of the highest quality. The breakfast options was varied and mainly continental. I would like to suggest labelling of some food and drink as I was unsure what they were . There was a choice of two menus for dinner the Morrocan and the International menu which gave great options. I enjoyed dining at the restaurant which has both beautiful indoor and outdoor seating seating with the outdoor seating having beautiful views of the hotel and the distant Atlas Mountains    Spa    We tried the duo relax package for couples and really enjoyed the experience. The hammam was an experience on its own and the staff were really professional. The massage was very relaxing and enjoyable and the service reflects the calm and soothing atmosphere the hotel gives off    The owner / management    The Owner Mehdi has a done a fantastic job throughout and can be found often visible daily. He takes a keen interest in the hotel guests ensuring they are gettng the best possible experience. The managment team and staff do a fantastic job in his absence and he along with all his staff should take pride in what they have achieved together.    I would definately recommend this hotel without question and would definately stay here again if I was to return to Marrakech.,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bolton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrandMrsOomer
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Swisstrek wrote a review Oct 2012,50,"Tranquil, Chic, Discreet",The Sirayane exceeded our expectations! Plus the value for the price was very favorable. The property is beautifully designed with nuances of traditional design but it is not overrun with kitsch. The rooms are modern and spacious. The restaurant offers delicious Moroccan cuisine. In all honesty there is a huge difference between the quality of the 2 menus. My recommendation --- stick to the tagines! The spa is mid-grade compared to what you may be used to in other resort hotels. But the hamam and manicure/pedicures are the best I've ever received. The overall feel of the property is peaceful.    I would also like to highlight the staff. The owner Mehdi kept a watchful (yet discreet) eye over the staff as well as the guests to ensure we were well taken care of. He takes his role as manager very seriously and will personally handle details of your visit. One evening my friend and I happened to return very late from a day trip (arrived at 10pm when guest normally return at 5pm) and Mehdi was on the phone with the driver every 30 minutes checking our status and he greeted us at the gate upon our late return. He then escorted us to the dining room even though dinner service was about to end.    In addition to Mehdi we found Bader at reception Said at the shuttle service and another Said in the dining room to be outstanding.    I can't wait to return to Sirayane.

Marrakech is a 15 minute hop in their courtesy bus and is quite addictive...the bustle colour and vibrancy of the place is in stark contrast to the serenity of the Sirayane and one comliments the other very well.  The hammam experience in the spa at the hotel is a must. I've never had one before but they scrub you in three different ways leave you to sweat in a large sauna between scrubs and then layer on muddy goodness to top it all off. My skin sparkled like I've never seen before - incredibly good! The girls in the spa were also worthy of mention - so very sweet and gentle...lovely people indeed and a credit to the hotel.  My room was by the pool and had it's own private garden although not sure why as the garden was the only let down in the place and I didn't see anyone using theirs! It wasn't cared for sufficiently with plants withering and grass long in some places (a strimmer would be a suggestion). The bouganvillia that was attempting to climb the bare walls only needed a little water every day and would flourish and make such a difference! The pool which was 10 strides away was lovely not heated but in 45 dgrees was just perfect. However you DO NOT see the Atlas mountains like on their website. There is a a building on the other side of their perimeter fence and on the clearest day I could vaguely make out a 'peak'...but a long way off.  Food was excellent. I took the half board option and I could have had fillet mignon every night and I left the restaurant full and satisfied without fail. Cocktails were excellent value and very well made/presented. Tequila sunrises were my weapon of choice for the holiday! Delish!! Again the waiting and bar staff very affable and looked after me very well as a single traveller. The evening at the Sirayane were really excellent quality and value for money and I always had a lovely time chilling in their bar lounge talking to the staff and listening to the (very good) variety of music they played.  Breakfast was average and it would have benefitted from being laid out on flat ironed linen and not the bunched up ruched thing they had going on! Very 80's and not in a good way!! But the food was good. they do not have Marmite so if you are an addict like me take your own!  All in all I would highly recommend this hotel really for value for money and a good experience. Yes like all places there are some things that can be improved but they will go out of their way to make you happy they don't rip you off at the bar and it's a great place to recharge the batteries!,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Basingstoke, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lambo-Girl
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Ordell R wrote a review Sep 2012,50,Beautiful hotel and gardens,My wife and I got a great deal through BA which included the top room in the hotel. The room was spacious and had its own pool and garden. The bathroom was huge and included a walk-in shower and a jacuzzi. Breakfast was very nice and there was a huge selection of juices including beetroot! We dined 2 nights out of 4 and found the food most satisfactory. The spa is good value for money and well worth a visit. Room service was prompt. Complimentary shuttles to and from the Medina were punctual. Housekeeping could not be faulted (it was a nice touch to have our towels folded into swans).    Basically this hotel delivers and is worthy of its 5-star rating.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Sarah B wrote a review Sep 2012,50,As oasis - Great Hotel,Arrived back today after spending 4 nights in at the Sirayane. We were picked up by the Hotel staff (need to pay for Transfer) takes about 15 minutes. When you arrive at the hotel which initially you wonder where you are going as it is down a dirt track you go through to a gated development and are greeted by the Hotel staff who attend you with Mint tea and biscuits. Our room wasn't ready so we changed at the spa and went straight to the pool.    The pool attendants are great they made sure I was always in the shade by moving my umbrella as the sun moved.. Double bed sun beds with Pillows make you think you are actually in bed - for me Fantastic.    Breakfast is basic if you are into cereals and nuts etc however if you like sweet things it is great. There were more juices than I could mention including carrot and beetroot! We asked about brown bread and it was given to us every morning without fail.    The staff are great very friendly. The rooms are large enough all with either balcony or sun area all very well thought out. Oddly they don't have toilet roll holders they put it on the window sill.    Communal areas are spacious and nicely decorated and becuase there are only 28 rooms you don't ever feel crowded. The free bus to town and back is a great touch. you need to put your name down in the morning for both the outward and return. They check you on and more importantly they check back in expecially at night.    We ate at the hotel one night to have the Lamb (need to advise 24hrs in advance) was absolutely lovely however way too much for just 2! Every other night ate in the square at the tressel tables the food was excellent and incredibly cheap. Never spent more than 100 Dhm each. You have to dodge the guys trying to get you to sit at their table! All the food and the prices are the same. So it is a case of pick the one that hassles the least.    Alcohol is only sold in the hotels Mint tea was described to us as the Moroccan whisky it is sold everywhere.    I would definitely return it was a great place to relax and do nothing which was just what I did...,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahbY6534OA

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,sdjohns84 wrote a review Sep 2012,50,A special place we will never forget,We have just returned home from a 4 night stay at this amazing hotel and it really was perfect from start to finish. We were greeted at the airport and on the 15 minute journey to the hotel the driver took time to explain some of the interesting things to do during our stay. On arrival at the hotel we were greeted with complimentary traditional drinks and snacks and then we were shown the spa and restaurant before being taken to our room.    We dined in the restaurant twice during our stay for lunch and twice for our evening meal and all the food was excellent and the service better than I have had in some of the best restaurants in London. There is a good choice of Moroccan and international food along with drinks and cocktails that are reasonably priced. There was also a very good selection of foods for breakfast.    The room was very spacious (we had a garden room) and was very clean. The pool was a perfect size for the hotel and there were plenty of sunbeds spaced well around the pool. We had spa treatments which included the hammam and massage and it was excellent.    There is a free regular shuttle bus that goess to the Medina which is a 15 minute drive. They can also book private taxis for you and advise on and book tours and trips.    I cannot fault the service at this hotel from the minute we arrived to a very warm welcome the Owner & Manager personally greeting each of the guests and chatting to them every day the waiter service reception team and the lovely ladies in the spa - I have never stayed in a hotel where the service has been this consistently excellent.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Suze wrote a review Sep 2012,50,An oasis of calm at this hidden gem,I have just returned from a 5 night stay at this hotel with my husband and it is one of the best hotel experiences we have had.    All the other reviews are spot on the staff are very helpful the rooms and facilities are immaculate the breakfast buffet is vast and lunch and dinner menus also very reasonable and food is of a high standard.    The hotel is approximately a 15 minute drive from the centre of Marrakech the hotel offers a free shuttle bus service both ways this was actually a plus for us as it meant that we could escape the hustle and bustle of Marrakech but yet still visit freely if we wanted to sightsee or to eat out for a change.    The hotel decor is very stylish and the ambience is very relaxing great for a chilled out break away from the rat race. It is a great place for couples or small groups of friends wanting peace and quiet.    I had a Hammam at the Spa and my husband a massage and we were both very happy price of treatments here are more or less similar to those in the UK.    Thank you to all the brilliant staff who made our stay memorable. We will definitely be recommending this hotel to family and friends and we will definitely be returning.,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/808susie
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Keith D wrote a review Sep 2012,50,"A lovely, lovely experience ‚Äì thank you Sirayane",We visited Marrakesh in August 2012 staying at the Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa. We were suitably pleased on arrival at the huge grand entrance doors finest marble floors and walls impeccable politeness and service from the staff and the lovely and comfortably appointed bedrooms which were much superior when compared to the 4* hotel rooms we have in London. The rooms were serviced daily and we had nothing to complain about. The dinner menu was nicely traditional (we stayed at the hotel for dinner on our first and last night and were not disappointed). We also enjoyed very much the peaceful ‚Äòzen‚Äô atmosphere of the hotel. The loungers by the pool were great the pool was perfect to keep cool in and the staff could not do enough to make our stay pleasant and enjoyable. Breakfast was the highlight of the day with so much choice. The staff were discreet but available when needed and nothing was too much trouble. We also made good use of the internet connection. There is daily shuttle to and from the medina and the driver Saeed was a great person to chat too. All of the staff were great and so polite. There is so much we could tell you about this hotel but we don‚Äôt want to spoil the lovely surprises should you decide to stay there. We definitely enjoyed all the special touches and for us this was the most perfect hotel you could wish to stay at for rest relaxation. This is very much a hotel for couples or those seeking some peace and solitude away from the crowds. The boutique smallness of this hotel was a big plus; much nicer than staying in one of the large popular brand hotels. We‚Äôd definitely would stay here again and recommend it.,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Babylon_108
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Mstephensonpope wrote a review Sep 2012,50,"Amazing, peaceful hotel.",We arrived at the hotel a party of three women and felt safe and secure from the very beginning. All of the staff were incredibly hospitable and welcoming.  Despite the fact that we arrived during the last few days of Ramadan the staff were still attentive and couldn't do enough for us.    One of our party is disabled and everything was thoroughly accessible - although the courtyard from the reception to the main hotel does include a couple of steps as does the entrance. So whilst everything is not totally wheelchair friendly the stairs are minimal.  Additionally two of us are vegetarians. There doesn't appear to be a huge amount of vegetarian options for dinner but the staff offered us our own 'tweaked' options without meat which was very thoughtful. Breakfast was also amazing with a huge array of food and drink.  The manager was always available for questions and regularly asked whether he could do anything to make our stay better.    The hotel in general is gorgeous and modern especially the pool area. Our room was perfect for us and the little garden was ideal for relaxing in solitude.    Overall we had an amazing time in this hotel. It's perfect for relaxing away from the madness of central Marrakech but the centre is still accessible with regular free shuttles. We intend to go back as soon as possible!,Date of stay: August 2012,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mstephensonpope
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,littleone74 wrote a review Sep 2012,50,A perfect honeymoon hotel.,We stayed at the Sirayane hotel from August 12-17th this year. We managed to purchase a group on deal for 5 nights at around ¬£500. We upgraded our room for our own private pool (room 118) as it was our honeymoon.    We had nothing but a truly wonderful time at this 2 year old hotel. All the staff are very helpful and polite from the hecking in processs to the waiters each day.  The room was very modern as is the hotel style around the bar. Breakfast was nice although the scrambled eggs looked slightly uncooked and sloppy some days. Lots of choice for breakfast too! We had a lovely meal overlooking the pool in the hotel on the first evening which was expensive compared to the prices in the city and the hotel add on 10% service charge after. As vegetarians there were only 2 options on the menu which were quite similar so we wouldnt have eaten in the hotel again in the evening due to limited choice.  As part of the groupon deal we also had a hammanan spa treatment- neither of us knew wht this would involve and it would have been nice to have had this explained first. Lying on the hot stone bench was uncomfortable as it was so hot and even with a towel place down to lie on it was still very hot. The 20min massage was very nice.  The taxi/shuttle service into the city is fab you just book the time slots in advance for going and returning. Be prepared though for crazy drivers in Marrakech- its an experience you must witness especially at 10pm when the mosque kicks out!  My husband and I were a bit shocked that the hotel drivers whilst taking us to the city were often texting/making and receiving phone calls on their mobiles not hands free-and sometimes didn't wear seatbelts- perhaps this is something that the manager needs to address to his staff as it was a bit un-nerving to us who are used to higher safety rules back at home.    Being in Marrakech in the summer was challenging- very hot and in a way it was perfect that we were at such a lovely relaxing hotel. We spent our days relaxing in our room or pool and then headed into Marrakech in the evenings usually at 5pm or 6.45pm. (it was still very warm at 5pm). The hotel is about 20mins away from the centre and is in the middle of no where so you can't really just take a walk into the centre yourself youneed to rely on the shuttle. I wouldnt advice hiring a car as the drivers in Marrakech are nuts!  We found the locals in the medina quite intrusive at times and you should be prepared to be approached to buy their products or have guided tours or taxi rides. It did get very tiring at times being approached so much- 5/6 people coming up to us within 10mins. Its a very busy city with lots of people we felt safe on most occasions but the constant asking for taxis and horse rides was too much!    This hotel is a perfect choice for a relaxing holiday experience and I would recommend upgrading to your own pool if you can. We would definitely stay at the Sirayane if we went back to Marrakech again. The hotel manager/owner was always seen walking around meeting and greeting guests each day.

I cannot recommend enough this beautiful boutique hotel. We arrived late in the morning and they offered us breakfast which we were not expecting! Then we were told we had been upgraded to a room with views of the pool which was such a nice surprise! Once we were taken to our rooms we were given a tour of the hotel by a very friendly and smiley guy. I think his name is Simon... but he was just so lovely and made us feel very welcomed. The rooms and hotel in general are beautifully decorated very comfortable and always spotless!    We stayed for three nights and we could not have been happier. We are all quite fussy but nothing seemed to be too much trouble and all the staff just went out of their way to meet our requests always with a smile!    The hotel is located just outside Marrakesh and its very quite and peaceful far away from all the craziness and noise of the city! The hotel has a shuttle service which is free and takes about 15 minutes to get to and from the center.    In the evenings when we went to the bars and clubs the hotel arranged a driver to take us and pick us up. The charge for this was only 20 Euros which we found reasonable. This service was available all night and made us feel very safe as we had been worried about transport in the evening being a group of just girls.    We also used the swimming pool everyday which is so clean and beautiful! the pool guy was fantastic and very patient with all our requests! We often ordered drinks and the service from the bar was also very good.    If you are thinking of staying at the Sirayane don't hesitate you will not regret it!

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,mrtravelmore wrote a review Aug 2012,50,"Great place, great service, Great holiday",We spent 3 nights at the Sirayane after spending a few days staying at one of the 5 stars riads in the heart of the Medina. We felt: relieved upgraded and finally started our relaxing holiday in marrakech. The medina area is great if you want to get to know better about Marrakech but some of the people on the streets are so agressive to you and force you to buy things you dont need (we have one bad experience at the souks where a guy who we'd mistaken as happily giving us direction back to Jema el Fna ended up assaulting us and forced us to pay him 200 dirhams just for this). Sirayane is a great boutique resorts a bit far from the actions but if you still want to have a taste of Marrakech can do so in 15 minutes (free) shuttle ride from the hotel.    The resort was fantastic. I love the swimming pools and the villas. Ours had a private backyard with sun loungers. The service was great. Since its a boutique resort service is very personalised and attentive. Breakfast lunch and dinner were served in the restaurant overlooking the pool. Good selection for breakfast great dinner (a range of morrocan fare) but limited choice for lunch (which could've been better - thats my only feedback here).    Free shuttle bus runs throughout the day. This was reliable and save you about 15 euros cab ride each way.    We had a great help from the hotel when my partner was sick we thought it was travellers' tummy. The hotel couldnt be more helpful to us: they helped us fetch some medicine called us the doctor and went to the parmacies to buy the perscriptions (and this was in the month of Ramadhan when most shops are closed). We felt really touched and sincerely grateful for this. They even let us to use the room until 7pm (against the usual check out time of 12pm) since my partner was sick and therefore needed a lot of rest.

Prior to staying I emailed hotel for info they are very quick to respond & helped arranged for transfer (20‚Ç¨) I'm glad we did as the taxis look a little old & crumbly. Hotel also provides free shuttle to Medina- such a great service.    We stayed in room 101 which is in the main building balcony over looks pool & the bit of land where the sheep takes a walk everyday! So cute!  The room is nice size king sized beds with super lovely linens lots of wardrobe space & rain shower no tub but there are 2 sinks which is great! All amenities provided gown slippers vanity kits hairdryer bath wash & shampoo (no conditioner)    King sized beds by pool is fantastic though more umbrellas should be available hotel should also stick with Buddha Bar tunes rather than 90s pop by the pool.    Breakfast is quite simple with lots of juices! Lunch is good though I would prefer more Morrocan opts on lunch menu but dinner is sooo yummy the Morrocan dishes are delicious & well presented the chocolate icecream is really nice also I was lucky they gave me 4 scoops! :)    The spa is a must! The girls are very professional I went twice Hamman+massage & Facial they were both amazing & opening hours are nice & long into the evening.    Hotel has a range of excursions but hotel helped tailor made ours by arranging for a licensed tour guide for us & then dropped us of at the Medina where the guide met us. ( I have posted a photo of the guides detail & his details in the forum 'Sharing my Info on licensed tour guide-Marrakech')    The service you will receive here is very personal you will also see the big boss once a day he is very amiable & the general managers are really lovely.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Alex C wrote a review Jul 2012,30,It's good but lower your expectations...,Overall a very nice place. I went with my girlfriend for a relaxing 5 days and stayed in a standard poolside room.  The bad: the service is possibly the slowest I have ever experienced. Poolside waiters are hard to grab and literally take ages to bring you the order (even if just drinks).  The food is so so so bad. It's my opinion that the people of Marrakech are bad cooks anyway because everywhere had bad food but remember this is a spa hotel and you would not know that looking at the menu (full of stodge). Where are the smoothies? Fruit juices? Healthy salads? The salads that are available are horrid.  It is very very hot in Marrakech and the hotel doesn't seem to appreciate this - perhaps more AC units are needed inside. Also it would be so great to have water sprayers above the outside eating area like most nice places have in hot climates.  Pool shuts too early.  Housekeeping is rubbish. On two occasions they didn't tidy our room and I am sure the sheets were never replaced.  Music by the pool needs to be more relaxing and slightly louder. Stick to Chilled Ibza Lounge or something and not the Paverotti that I think I heard sometimes.  Breakfast needs to go until 11:30 - currently it finishes at 10. This is not a relaxing time.  Hard beds are not those you would expect in a spa hotel.    The Good: Room is lovely buildings are well designed lighting is good. Only a few rooms in the hotel and people are friendly. Sun beds are great. Staff are friendly.    SPA: never went looks nice though and prices look good.    Marrakech itself - don't waste your time going to the centre (Medina). Its a horiible horrible place and literally stinks of p!ss. I find it so difficult to believe that this is a world heritage site. People are rude if you don't buy anything and the market products are not that good. Apparently the waterfalls in the Atlas mountains are very nice. Go to a restaurant called Bo Zin that is very nice.,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,manchester,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KingChalkz

The hotel also has its own bar restaurant spa and swimming pool and a complimentary taxi to the city.  ...but the main reason I have felt it necessary to write this review is the Hotels vibe.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Victoria C wrote a review Jul 2012,50,Amazing getaway,We stayed for 1 night at the end of our trip and it was like heaven. A real break from the hectic medina and a brilliant way to end our holiday. We wished we could have stayed there longer. We booked a junior suite with its own pool and we got upgraded to the deluxe suite which was amazing. We had so much space huge room and bathroom and our own garden and pool which weren't small either. We barely left our room. We did eat at the restaurant which wasn't brilliant but the staff were very friendly and helpful. We got a hammam for 2 as part of the deal which we were a little disappointed with but we don't have any other hammam experience to compare it to. The spa was lovely and clean and again the staff were lovely and accomodating.  It is further out from the medina that we thought and there is a shuttle bus but we were happy to stay put as we'd already spent time staying in the medina. We would definitely recommend this place if you want to be outside of the medina and it's small enough not to feel like you're in a big hotel.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,mat8iou wrote a review Jul 2012,50,Calm & peaceful location on edge of a busy city,The staff here were very welcoming & greeted us on arrival taking our bags while we sat & filled in the forms to check in. We were given a brief tour of the hotel before being led to our room.    The decor is interesting - funky but minimal.    The room was spacious & on our arrival was decorate with petals which was a nice touch.    The restaurant was good - staff were friendly & there was a fair range of Moroccan & International food there although the prices were a lot higher than you would pay at independent restaurants in Marrakech.    The free shuttle service to the city centre was great although check before hand for the times of this as there are a few periods in the middle of the day when there are not any & if you ask them to call for a cab they will tend to use their own transport but charge you ‚Ç¨20 for it.    The pool area was great & the service fro the bar there was also good although it is a shame that the pool closes fairly early in the evenings - often to early for us to use it after arriving back from a day spent in the city.    Staff were all very helpful moving umbrellas for us to keep the same amount of shade without us having to ask them. It felt fairly personal - as if the staff remembered you from day to day.    There was a high staff to guest ratio & it was clear that a lot of time was spent cleaning & gardening - especially after a sand storm evening which required them to wash off all the furniture on the balconies etc.    We had a Hammam treatment included in our booking which was good although the tea afterwards was served in basic tea cups - the attention to detail here was slightly lacking compared to the rest of the hotel.    I would definitely recommend it to other people wanting to travel to Marrakech - and in many ways you could stay there without every going into the city if you wanted to spend a few days just lazing by the pool.,Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mat8iou
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Melanie B wrote a review Jul 2012,50,Oasis in the Desert,A wonderful hotel outside Marrakech with an excellent bus service to and from the centre. The quality of the rooms food and service was excellent and we thoroughly enjoyed our three nights at this hotel. The hotel also has an excellent spa - the perfect antidote to the sensory overload that is the medena. Photos of the pool area do not do it justice - it's a really comfortable relaxing place to hang out and a pleasure to swim in when the temperatures get too high. Lamb and apricot tagine was AMAZING! Its quite a distance outside the centre so best suited to those who prefer to visit the action than stay in the centre of it.,Date of stay: October 2011,,Ireland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ItchyFeetIreland
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,RWM2010 wrote a review Jul 2012,50,Absolutely fantastic - 1st Class Hotel deserves more than 5*,We stayed in October 2011. I have just arrived back from a Hotel in Spain that holds the same 5 star rating. Having just written a good review for that hotel I thought it only fair that I express how much better the Sirayane was.    First of all the staff - they are absolutely fantastic nothing is too much trouble for them. I actually told one of them Rani that I fancied using the Tennis Court but that my Girlfriend did not want to play me - believe it or not the next day he told me he would bring some kit and after finishing his shift we played a full game of tennis!! Neither of us were really Wimbledon standard but it was a great laugh and it was one of the things I'll remember forever.    Secondly the Rooms - we had a Grand Suite with Private Pool - this was certainly I great choice - we had our own garden with obviously a pool and various garden furniture. The staff would bring any food or drink to you from the bar without question and it was without doubt one of the most relaxing experiences of my life    Thirdly - The food - we stayed on a Bed and Breakfast Basis but invariably ate 3 meals a day at the hotel. The food was a good mix of local and international cuisine and was always of the highest standard and reasonably priced. The alcohol was relatively expensive but as there is no mass market for alcohol in a Muslim country that is understandable.    The Manager and Owner both made themselves available and often came over to ask us if we were enjoying our stay. The rest of the Bar and Reception staff were similarly attentive - Rani and 'Thierry Henry' are of course two who I remember best. The room and the rest of the hotel were spotlessly cleaned to the highest standard. We used the shuttle bus every day this was a very nice touchj which really did make our stay as without it we would have had to arrange a taxi every night some of which were a little bit scary!!! You could also ring the hotel at any time of day or night and they would send a car to you wherever you were in Marrakech - they simply added the money to your bill.    Finally Marrakech - well the place is absolutely amazing and I cannot believe it is only 4 hours from here. It appears to be booming with large scale construction projects being funded by both private investors and with the backing of the Royal Family. The old town and main square are a real experience and the new town with its Pacha and Nikki Beach would not look out of place in Miami!!! The weather was amazing and all together we had a fantastic stay. We will be back!!!,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Staffordshire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RWM2010
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Lizzie A wrote a review Jul 2012,50,Relaxed holiday at a beautiful hotel!,We spent 4 nights at this hotel at the end of June/beginning of July. Having never been to Morocco before we weren't entirely sure what to expect and were pleasantly surprised. The staff were absolutely fantastic and would bend over backwards to make sure our stay was comfortable. The food was of a very high quality with a traditional Moroccan set menu at dinner that was reasonably priced and delicious. The hotel itself is beautifully designed the layout of the rooms was excellent. Although we booked the cheapest room in the hotel we never felt this way: the room was spacious and had an excellent shower large comfortable bed and huge balcony! We spent most of our time in the hotel and by the pool only going into the Medina once during our stay but the free shuttle bus meant we could have gone more if we had wished we just didn't want to leave the relaxing confines of the hotel. We would definitely recommend this hotel for couples.,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LizzieA286
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Faizal S wrote a review Jul 2012,50,Great Experience & Thumbs Up!,I have just returned from a 10 day first anniversary holiday. After weeks upon weeks of looking at reviews for hotels in Marrakech we decided to go with the Sirayane based on what others had written. A great hotel with free shuttles throughout the day to the centre taking only 15 mins. The manager was always on hand to say hello and ask how your day was and the rooms (more like suites) we very large with a private garden. Just so you know we had a standard room. Very clean and well looked after by the hotel staff.    My main advice is to ask for one of their shuttle drivers called Said (Saeed) who I got talking to for any excursions you may want to do. He was a damn sight cheaper than anyone else and treated us as his own family. He will take you on a private tour and flexible to let you stop and start wherever you want along the way. We did the Ourika Valley Atlas Mountains tour through him. Great hearted huy and highly recommended!    Staff are friendly and willing to help. there is a DVD player in the room iwth a large HD TV. Mini bar in the room. Great food in the restaurant with your traditional dishes coupled with a good old steak or burger if you fancy something normal!    My only gripe would be the lack of English TV channels but hey we didn't go to be there sat watching the TV!!    Would definately recommend and would return there again.    Also we noticed that if you book this hotel in Marrakech then the rate for a standard room is around 2100 dirhams per night (about ¬£160 per night) - so the prices you see booking in the UK are great value!,Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Nuneaton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FaizalS868

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Helen M wrote a review Jun 2012,50,Very Peaceful,I have given this hotel an excellent rating even though it is not a five star but a good four star. You cannot fault the service from the owner who welcomed us everyday to the waiters and other staff who could not do enough. The food in the restaurant is superb and the local wine excellent.    My only niggle would be I did not like the decor in the main areas and the air con was not powerful enough (having said that the weather was exceptionally hot-47 degrees).    I recommend arranging the hotel to send car to the airport - it is well worth the money.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Naz JM wrote a review Jun 2012,50,Lovely 6 days at Sirayane Hotel,We've just come back from a 5 night stay at Sirayane. When we arrived to Marrakech we were picked up at the airport by the transport we arranged with Sirayane beforehand. The driver was very welcoming and helpful and was very well informed about our stay. When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by the owner and the reception staff as well as the manager. We then were seated at the luxurious reception area and offered Moroccan tea while the manager gave us an introduction to the hotel and talked through what activities we can do during our stay as well other essential details such as timings of the shuttle bus timing of breakfast lunch dinner etc. We were then introduced to the rest to the staff and then was walked over to our suite where our luggage was awaiting us. Every morning there was a buffet of a variety of breakfast we could have. There was a pool guy who was always on hand when we wanted to sunbathe who provided us with fresh towels. The bar staff were very friendly and always brought our drinks to us whether we were inside or outside sunbathing. The owner of the hotel greeted us every day making us feel very welcome and making sure our stay was satisfactory. The shuttle bus was always on time and took approx 15 mins to get to Medina. Everyday our room was cleaned we were given fresh towels our drink fridge was refilled and the toiletries were replaced with new ones. I would highly recommend this hotel if you stay at Sirayane there is no need to go out as everything is there. We will definitely be coming back some time in the near future.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Jonathan R wrote a review Jun 2012,50,Fabulous Long Weekend at the Sirayane,We're just back from a long weekend in Marrakech where we stayed at the Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa. We were met at the airport by an extremely courteous driver who loaded our bags and delivered us to the hotel in just under 15 minutes. The staff at check in welcomed us warmly dealt with the paperwork smoothly and efficiently and we were then served with a welcoming mint tea and Moroccan pastries in the cool surroundings of the reception area. Walking to our room passing members of staff greeted us with a smile and a wave.    Having visited Marrakech several times before we had decided to spend this mini break at the hotel and enjoy the pool bar and restaurant facilities in an extremely leisurely fashion. And that's exactly what we did. The pool is fabulous crystal clear and the surrounding sunbathing areas and gardens are beautifully maintained. The pool staff are extremely attentive showing you to one of the double sun beds and sorting out towels and a table for you the moment you set foot in the area. Once comfortable the friendly poolside waiting staff offer you a drink from the well-stocked bar menu and all you have to do is lie back and enjoy it!    Leaving poolside for a bite to eat at lunchtime we sat on the terrace overlooking the pool and enjoyed a lovely Chef's Salad and a Club Sandwich washed down with a very generous glass of Moroccan rose. The restaurant is very well staffed you never have to wait for anything and the manager drifts from table to table checking that everything is OK and you are getting what you want. On our second day the fish skewers I fancied were unavailable and the manager suggested I have a fillet of grilled John Dory as an alternative. It was perfect!    Our evening meals in the restaurant were just as good. On our first two nights we ate from the Moroccan menu the fish tagine was particularly nice and on our last night from the International Menu. I have to say the steak was superbly tender and beautifully cooked.    Standards of maintenance and housekeeping were equally good in the bedrooms. We had a lovely room with a balcony overlooking the pool. The bathroom was spotless the water was always hot and there were plenty of towels and robes. Shampoo and shower gel were plentiful. The room itself was extremely spacious and tastefully decorated and there was a huge amount of wardrobe space with plenty of coat hangers. Staff arrived to turn down the room at around 6.00 every evening and the daily housekeeping was excellent. We always came back to a perfectly tidy room generously sprinkled with rose petals and a restocked minibar. We couldn't fault it.    So all in all we rated the Sirayane very highly. It was just the sort of hotel we wanted. Being a boutique hotel it only has around 28 rooms so you get all the personal care and attention from staff as you would in a Riyad but without the anonymity of one of the bigger international hotels.  We would definitely start there again.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Dgilly wrote a review Jun 2012,50,"Excellent relaxing hotel in lovely serene location with fantastic attentive staff, beautiful food and nice rooms.",We are 2 Irish ladies who travelled from  London and stayed in this hotel from 14 to 17 June 12. It is nicely located away from the madness of the medina. Free shuttle bus into town several times a day which picks u up where u were dropped off..    We really couldn't find fault with this  hotel. It is 5 star In Morocco but not as fancy as 5 star hotels in Europe but that's Morocco anyway been a different culture.    We had a room with private garden. The rooms are a fantastic size double shower flat screen tv but only 2 channels in the English language. Rooms cleaned every day and spotless. We needed some extra toiletries and the staff sent a driver to the shop to get those for us at no charge. Minibar with beer wine and soft drinks. Air con in the room so it was always cool. The most comfy bed ever with big fluffy pillows.    Outside there is a beautiful pool which is lit up at night. Beds along by the pool are perfect and attendants always on hand with fresh towels and to move your parasol as the sun moves and they are very handsome chaps ;). If u fancy a beer or soft drink by the pool all u have to do is catch the eye of the waiter and it's brought over to you.    Breakfast is served up to 1030 every morning which is good. Great variety from cereals yogurts fruit pastries ham cheese croissants bread sausages scrambled eggs pancakes etc etc. 7 or 8 different types of fresh juice tea coffee and chocolate! You can take some food with u to nibble on later on in the day.    Overall we couldn't find fault with this hotel the staff are very attentive very pleasant and always cheerful. Most of them speak English which is a plus. The owner approached us on arrival and introduced himself which was nice.

The hotel is 10km from Marrakech but there is a free shuttle service and when you've experienced the hectic atmosphere of the city it's nice to come back to some tranquility.    Highlights are the large and well-maintained pool with comfortable loungers spacious air-conditioned rooms with cable TV and DVD good food and wine in the restaurant especially the excellent breakfast buffet (you can eat indoors or outdoors) and the spa facilities where we were looked after by friendly and very professional staff.    The manager and owner both visit the guests regularly at their tables to make sure eveything is OK. The best experience was on our last day when one of the regular drivers took us to the Ourika Valley in the Atlas mountains. He was a superb guide and took us to a local market and stopped whenever we asked e.g. to take a short camel ride. We also had tea with a Berber family in their home. A great experience and an excellent day out!    All in all I would highly recommend this hotel.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Fachtna M wrote a review Jun 2012,50,a great place to relax and be based in,hi - we've just got back from Marrakech this morning (9th June) and we stayed at Sirayane from Mon-Friday.    I would recommend this to anyone looking for a relaxing place to stay without any hesitation at all. The rooms are very nice especially those next to (literally) the swimming pool with many nice touches - eg fresh rose petals scattered daily; the pool is really clean and suitable for all ages; the food is varied and very good; the spa has an excellent ambience and the hamman is well worth having.    One of the biggest assets the Sirayane has (apart from the reasonable prices) is the people who run and staff the hotel - everyone is so very friendly and helpful.    We found that it was an ideal place to stay outside of the city as we used the free shuttle a lot to visit the souk etc. We had no problem with the shuttle times or frequency and it was always there to take us back - especially important if you're stressed by the whole souk experience.    We met people who stayed in the city - in riads etc - and had a shuttle out to a pool/spa and they enjoyed that but for us it was better the other way round    Anyway to sum up we were very very pleased with our choice of somewhere to go and more importantly somewhere to stay - and thank-you to everyone at the Sirayane for your care and consideration.    fachtna,Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FachtnaM
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Steve B wrote a review Jun 2012,50,Relax and Enjoy,I've just returned from 7 nights at the Sirayane with my young family. We had a thoroughly relaxing vacation finding the evening shuttle to/from the medina very convenient to get plenty of the hustle and bustle of Marrakech in the cooler part of the day.    The hotel's best points are all the staff and the beds/linen which are exceptionally good followed closely by the calm space and attractive design of the rooms and pool which create a very luxurious and soothing environment. The worst point was the snooty attitude of some guests - who maybe would have preferred more exclusivity (or fewer children !)... but this was not at all reflected by the hotel staff and management who could not have been more welcoming of our 3 urchins. The food and wine aren't cheap but on the other hand couldn't be faulted for quality on a par with the best restaurants we found in town.    Overall I would thoroughly recommend the Sirayane if you want your vacation to blend the intense excitement of the medina with a world of luxurious relaxation and kind welcoming smiles.,Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Poole, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/123SteveB123

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Sonia335 wrote a review May 2012,40,Very relaxing stay,This hotel can boast a very relaxing atmosphere so it is good for a retreat for couples or anyone looking for some peace and tranquility. It really is out of the hustle and bustle and there is a free shuttle bus that will take you right into town at regular intervals but note the shuttle bus to the airport is not free and cost us 20 EUR. This was the only disappointment for us as the airport is only a 5/10 min drive.    The staff are brilliant at providing a great service very friendly and most of them speak some English which is great for non French speaking guests. The food is very good and the restaurant manager is very good at catering for any changes we really felt looked after.    The spa is very nice although there was a bit of a mix up on the length of the Hamamm treatment time we had asked for but this could have been avoided if we had double checked what we were booked in for when we got there or they had confirmed with us. Nonetheless it was wonderfully relaxing and clean the massage was also very good.    The pool is lovely and the beds by the pool are so very comfortable the attendant is very quick to come round and adjust your parasol and bring you fresh towels.    All in all a very nice stay if you would like a little attention and pampering by some wonderfully cheery staff nothing was too much trouble and your comfort is their priority.    On a general note we found Moroccan people in general were very hospitable and you can expect to be offered tea on a number of occasions. Just a little pointer the main square near the Koutobia can be a little daunting for two women at night we didn't feel it was overly dangerous but in comparison to the day time when everything moves much slower it was pretty full on with the crowds and scooters zipping past everywhere. Just need to be aware of this but don't let this spoil your evening experience as it very vibrant lively and colourful as is all of Marrakech. As with any holiday overseas you just need to have your wits about you. We were a bit wary after the bombings in the recent years but we found there was nothing to worry about and in general the Moroccans are very warm people.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Pinkfizz31 wrote a review May 2012,40,Delivered all it promised.,We stayed for 5 nights and as many Previous reviews say the hotel is a perfect retreat away from the hustle and bustle of the medina and souks.  The design is very nice and to our taste and this influenced our choice of hotel. It feels modern but not over done.  The pool is a perfect setting with nice big sunbeds that keep the sun all day long and the pool area tends not to get too busy and isn't ever crowded.  The rooms are a good size and very comfortable facilities and extra's are minimal but there's everything you need. And most of them have a nice private garden so you have plenty of space to yourselves.  The food was good we ate in the resturant 3 nights the service here was by the far the best in the whole hotel the portions were very large however but this is personal taste and not a negative.  Also a nice bar with a good drinks list it's a Shame more people didn't use the bar before or after dinner as this would help the atmosphere. We did feel the evenings were almost too relaxed.  Breakfast too was fine and all included in the room rate.  There is also a good spa with very good prices and extensive treatments. The gym needs a little work machines are old and not all in working order. I used it everyday but was disappointed that there was not more choice.  Overall the hotel is very good and delivers what it promises on the website I would choose this hotel over one in the centre of town every time.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,dals1m wrote a review May 2012,50,One of the best hotels we have ever stayed at - simples!,We booked our stay using a groupon deal after checking out the reviews since I wasn't quite sure what to expect and as other reviewers have stated already we weren't a tiny bit disappointed.  From pick up to drop off the Sirayane is all about you and you are made to feel so valued by the staff and service they provide. Nothing is too much trouble and the attentiveness is just at the right level from the pool attendants literally running over when they see you move to adjust the parasols so you don't have to to the waiters noticing a chipped glass whilst pouring you a drink and changing it. We had a bit of a mix up with the timing for the hammam we booked at the spa but again we were told it was no problem and to come back half an hour later. The owner also makes an effort to come over and introduce himself at some point during your stay - a nice touch.  The pool area is simply awesome the beds are a great idea and you really can't get a bad bed there whichever side of the pool you decide to sit on. We had a room with a private garden which led out to the pool - worth asking for (we were told there was no guarantee we would get one but luckily we did!) since you get a good deal of sun in the garden too if you don't want to sit by the pool. One suggestion to the hotel would be to install net curtains or something similar so that you still have privacy without closing the curtains during the day if you want.  We ate at the hotel restaurant and in the medina and while some of the restaurants in the medina are significantly cheaper we didn't have a single bad meal at the hotel. The food and drink is expensive here but getting to and from the medina using the free shuttle service for lunch/dinner is always an option.  The turn down service was a nice touch too with some real creativity shown by the staff there - I didn't realise towels could be folded in so many different ways!  All of the staff are a real credit to the hotel top marks for service simple but beautiful decor and for creating exactly the right kind of atmosphere you want from a hotel whilst on holiday.  I cannot recommend this hotel enough.,Date of stay: May 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dals1m

The staff and service are really good attentative etc. The value for money was ok the food was equal slightly less for the same quality to restaurant costs locally but the drinks where expensive (¬£4.50 small bottle of beer). Excellent free shuttle lovely pool great sunbeds overall NO complaints at all. We will return !! the only slight is a lack of drinks i the rooms (No tea or coffee) and the gym is rubbish even the multi gym had bits and bolts missing and was unuseable.,Date of stay: May 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MattyH69
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Seth P wrote a review May 2012,50,Tranquil oasis with fantastic service,Some background: we were traveling through Portugal and Spain with a plan to go to Marrakesh. Not being super planners we didn't book a hotel before leaving the US. While we were in Spain we got online and after searching a bunch of 4 & 5 star hotels (as rated by the Moroccan government natch) we decided on Sirayane. Not having been to the city before we didn't have a sense of layout or distance but we like boutique hotels and the reviews were good. We did the booking entirely online.    Fast forward a couple of days and we arrive in Marrakesh early morning on the night train from  Tangiers (side note Frommer's guide couldn't be more alarmist and pandering about Morocco). We give the address of Sirayane to the driver who assures us he knows it and negotiate a price. As we are driving through the city then out of the city then what appears to us to be way out of the city we think hmmm maybe we should have done more research.    I'm here to tell you that not only did we have nothing to worry about staying at Sirayane turned  out to be one the highlights of the trip. The issue for us on the trip out was a bit of disorientation from the early hour and train ride and having no sense for the town. In reality the hotel is only a couple of kilometers from the city center - something you come to appreciate after spending hours navigating the Medina and Souks. But I'll get there.    So we arrive at the hotel at about 9am and they are understandably completely confused as to who we are and why we are there. Remember we booked online and never spoke to anyone. Once we told the front desk who we were they couldn't have been more accommodating. Acting like it was their fault for not anticipating we would show up ridiculously early without notice we were offered access to the spa to shower and change breakfast and shuttle service into the city to spend the time before our room was ready.    We took them up on all of these and when we returned we were shown to our room which was very much to our tastes. The hotel simulates the feel of a riad with a courtyard behind the reception area (which has fantastic huge wood doors) and the hotel sitting beyond it while at the same time giving a modern feel with the faux concrete walls and wide but quirky staircases leading to the several wings. Our room was over the dining area facing the pool (heated unheated and kiddie) with a balcony. There are poolside suites but we liked ours just fine.    The ceilings are super elevated in the common areas as they were in our spacious room and of course we had all the amenities. We were a bit concerned booking online because they say 'double' bed but it means queen or king - not an American double or twin. Air conditioning if needed (it wasn't) plenty of closet space quiet and a comfortable mattress. One oddity: a double rainwater shower with a view through frosted glass to the main part of the room - clearly couples focused.    The hotel runs a shuttle service into the city at regular and frequent intervals throughout the day  The drop off point is near the main square in the Medina so easy to find even if traffic is a bit  hectic. You can read somewhere else about how to handle all of the solicitations. We made good use of that service usually going in around 11 and coming back at 4 then returning around 7 until 11 for dinner. Once we had taken the shuttle a couple of times we realized it was only about a 15 minute trip and our perception of the ride on the way out was so distorted. The speed limit on the street is low so it feels far away but it's only about 2.5km. And that distance from the noise smell and activity of the city is MUCH appreciated after a few hours beating the stones in that maze and haggling over rugs. Which I'm sure you will be doing.    Most of the other guests seemed to be European on extended stays so though the shuttle has limited space and you have to reserve it we never had a problem. Not many of the other guests seemed to want to go into the city at night. This means we didn't experience dinner at the hotel but we did have breakfast and it was the kind of sumptuous buffet you'd expect with lots of fresh fruit and a killer variety of juices (beet? really? fantastic!).    In the afternoons we'd hang for a while at poolside and get cocktails attended by the super  friendly staff. And I think that's what really needs to be called out - the staff. I try to make  a point to get names but I'm writing this a bit after the fact so I can't remember everyone. I'll  just say that in addition to super positive attitudes there were two exceptional people I'd like to  describe. One was a young man at the front desk/concierge who went out of his way to help us make reservations explain everything from street directions to Moroccan culture and put up with my cliched and yet not ugly or alarming American gregariousness. The other special person was a young woman who appeared to be the hotel manager who was there morning noon and night attentive both to the guests and apparently every detail of the hotel. She was always ready with a smile and never ceased to make sure we had everything we needed to enjoy our stay. Neither made fun of me for busting out my high school French though they shifted quickly to English (no worries there for you unilinguals). And the hotel owner popped by one evening to say hello. They care.    We did couples massages and the Hamman which I highly recommend. I don't want to spoil it with description (surprise was part of the fun) it but it is relaxing makes you feel great and is probably unlike anything you have experienced at an American or European spa.    So in summary you will probably get better value at Sirayane than a larger hotel and you will  certainly get more personable service. You'll appreciate being a step removed from the Medina and city with convenient access. It's like an oasis on the other side of town with all of the  amenities you need after 'experiencing' Marrakkech.,Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Austin, Texas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SethP861

Went in June of last year With my mum for her birthday on a Groupon deal. Paid a reasonable price for the deal but we went not expecting too much. The pick up from the airport is a bit airy fairy but apart from that everything exceeded our expectations. Set just outside of the hustle and bustle of the city centre and it was just perfect for a relaxing 5 days by the pool. Service was second to none staff went out of their way to help even lending me an iPad charger! Everything was immaculately clean and fresh rooms were decorated just to my taste! For those rare rainy days the hotel even has a DVD collection which you can make use off in your room. Food was a mix of traditional Moroccan and international dishes - the lamb tagine was delicious.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,thebeautyoftravel wrote a review May 2012,50,Moroccan Chic! Outstanding service in calm and serene surroundings,We had a short stay at the Sirayane but it was well worth it. The service was outstanding with staff always on-hand to assist. They make you feel taken care of and are so very polite. The hotel itself - serene understated luxury well maintained and impressive. Its located about 10 minutes from the main centre (i.e. souqs main tourist attractions Jamaa el Fna medina etc). The hotel is perfect for those who want rest and relaxation in a location that is away from all the hustle and bustle but still within a reasonably short drive away to be able to head into the heart of Marrakesh at ease and enjoy all that the excitement and rich atmosphere that it has to offer.    If you're looking for rest and relaxation in calm surroundings at a luxurious boutique hotel (but not ostentatious) this is it. I would definitely recommend this hotel and hope to return myself in the not to distant future it truly was a real pleasure to stay there.,Date of stay: April 2012,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thebeautyoftravel
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,cliff70 wrote a review Apr 2012,40,Peaceful,We arrived very early and where taken to breakfast (not alot of hotels would give this service). We were shown to our rooms 2 hours before check in time so again the hotel staff were very accomodating. However I had asked for rooms with views and close together and although I had made the booking and contacted the hotel requesting these the other couple in our party were upgraded to a garden room with own garden and we were in the main building with a view onto the roof and air con units I did complain but as the hotel is so small we were stuck with the room we were given. I was disappointed that there is no tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms but the mini bar is priced very fairly.  Breakfast is limited. Lunch and dinner were good and the portions are large the food tasty and the waiting staff are just lovely quiet polite and very laid back. The pool area is nice and there is a member of staff on hand to get you towels and move your umbrellas.  The spa treatments are good and quite reasonably priced.    The shuttle is great and takes you just outside the Medina which is absolute pandamonium; Human and Animal rights are not part of course here there are child beggars glue sniffers monkeys on chains injured animals and underfed horses and donkeys - so be warned. The traders are pushy and can be agressive and abusive if you don't buy from them and there are traders who just try to rip you off so think of a price you would pay and don't budge or be pushed into buying overpriced goods. There are some bargains and if you stand your ground you can get some good items.,Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,hertfordshire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cliff70

In the reception some staff very attentive others quite offish. It takes them a while to set up the entire buffet breakfast and a couple of times one of the things that took the longest time to appear was.. coffee!

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Biscuit1906 wrote a review Apr 2012,40,Peaceful hideaway from the craziness of medina,We stayed at the Sirayane for 4 days over Christmas 2011. Overall the hotel was very nice large rooms with our own private small garden very comfortable and clean. The food overall was very tasty with huge portions for lunch and a large selection for breakfast and it was lovely to sit on the terrace in the sun (albeit a little chilly early in the morning).  The pool and sun loungers were great the pool was chilly but swimmable. The free shuttle is very handy and comes and goes at reasonable times throughout the day but if you do hire one out of the specified times it is very pricey for such a short (15 minute) journey into the medina (more than a London cab!).  It was nice to come back in the afternoon or evening after walking around the medina to peace and quiet.  The staff were friendly and the owner/manager came and spoke to everyone daily to make sure we were having an enjoyable time.  The only negatives were: heating in one of our rooms did not work and kept switching off making the room very cold overnight despite mentioning it to reception it took 2 days to fix. Also on one return journey which we had booked with the driver we were left at the medina and it took over an hour for someone to come and get us as they kept promising someone was on the way.  Otherwise we enjoyed our stay and would come back.,Date of stay: December 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Florence, Italy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Biscuit1906

The hotel is absolutely incredible - the design elements of the hotel have been really well thought out and we loved the open fireplace in the lounge area (particularly on the colder days). The sun did come out for the last few days of our stay and we enjoyed the pool (although were less enthusiastic about the unheated one!) and the double sun loungers with pillows were so luxurious.  The rooms were excellent - very spacious with big bathrooms (although no bath) and our room had its own private garden leading out to the pool area.  The food in the hotel was excellent and not too expensive considering the quality but if you do want to go out to eat the hotel receptionists are happy to recommend restaurants and how to get there. There is a free shuttle bus running throughout the day which we made use of too.  All in all a fantastic hotel and we would not hesitate to go back.,Date of stay: November 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaddieM39

Great clean rooms with a lovely little private garden(prestige-room) with a great view of the Atlas mountains. I did not personally try their SPA but my girlfriend told me it was brilliant. The hotel is fairly small but that creates a very friendly atmosphere troughout the hotel.  BUT I mainly have to adress the service we recieved at Sirayane. The service at Sirayane was nothing but immaculate. They really go out of their way to make your stay in Marrakech memorable.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,omarbinder wrote a review Mar 2012,40,Lovely Intimate Hotel about 8km outside of Medina,Located slightly further out than I originally thought this is a lovely quiet hotel with good attention to detail and overall good customer service. There are around 30 rooms in total so you dont become a room number rather a guest which was nice. I travelled with my wife and 2 1/2 year old son. They were aboslutely brilliant with him (and the wife). They would make him rice or cous cous on demand and at no cost which was really very good of them.    The rooms - We had a mid range room. I understand there are suites as an upgrade. Our room\villa\terrace was overlooking the pool. It comprised of an enrance hallway bedroom shower room seperate WC and seperate sink and vanity area. The floors were all tiled in some form of stone\slate. The walls were all grey natural style sealed plaster. Very contemporary. We had a private garden with sun loungers and access to the main pool. The room was furnished with attractive furnishings and an LCD TV (no English channels bar BBC News 24). There was a DVD\USB media player though. Free Wi-FI albeit patchy to get from your room and at busy times difficult to latch on to. There is individual A\C for the room and pleasant views over the garden.    Breakfast - Included in our room rate. Plentiful in variety and was of a buffet style. Halal meatsm on demand eggs of your liking and a variety you would expect of any good hotel.    Dinner - Excluded from our rate. Tasty. Two menus to choose from both fixed price. Morrocan (tagines cous cous etc) was fixed at 220 MAD for two courses (exc drinks) and three course 270 MAD. International menu (fillet mignons thai chicken etc) was fixed at 320 MAD for 2 courses and 370 MAD for three courses. Well presented and tasty although less than average size portions.    Location - Approximately 8-9km outside of the Medina. This meant it was very peaceful and quiet but also expensive if you have to pay\haggle for a cab back from the medina (best we got was 100 MAD DAY \ 150 MAD Night). There is a free shuttle bus that runs throughtout the day at certain times to and from the hotel so best to try to get that. If you want a taxi from the hotel you have little option than to take the private transfer. Fixed at 20 Euro's each way.    Overall - All in all a very nice friendly hotel with some clever thought put into the presentation decor and features throughout the complex. Being so far out from the medina and other hotels\building means that if you are peckish by the pool or fancy pre dinner drinks it can be a costly affair. A small beer will set you back at least 5 GBP. Wine 6.5 GBP a glass. Knowing what I know I certainly WOULD consider staying here again.

The room was well equipped and luxurious although a little small for the four of us. In future I would book one of the suites that surround the pool.    The staff at this hotel have to be some of the friendliest and helpful that I have ever come across. Nothing was too much for them. We were made to feel incredibly welcome to the extent that the owner himself was on hand to wish us farewell at the end of our stay.    I only have two criticisms: there was an issue with one of the swimming pools when we stayed  which meant that it was not crystal clear but this can happen anywhere and they certainly pulled out all of the stops to fix it. My other (very slight) issue is that the food can become a bit ""samey"": the menu for both lunch and dinner is pretty fixed and doesn't change. This is only an issue if you stay for several days and don't eat in Marrrakech much. We did but I still feel that by varying the menu they would add something extra. That said the food was always of a high quality and the selection at breakfast is fantastic.    Overall I found this hotel extremely good value and a great retreat that is not far from the hustle and bustle of Marrekesh itself.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,davidandmel wrote a review Mar 2012,40,Lovely hotel away from medina,Chose this hotel for just one night after a week touring around the coastal area. We had already stayed in a riad in the medina last year so were just looking for a quality hotel where we could have a relaxing time for our last day somewhere not too far from the airport. If you are staying in Marrakech and want to do the sights then we would definately recommend that you stay in the old medina - it is a lot more atmospheric. If you just want to chillax and don't mind being reliant on the hotels (free) shuttle service or taxis to get in and out of the centre then this hotel is great.  We only had the cheapest room but it was lovely and big with a great bathroom. The terrace was small and didn't get the sun at all but the grounds and pool with the mountain views more than made up for that. Staff were excellent and we were greeted with mint tea and cookies before being given the hotel tour. We both had a relaxing massage in the spa which was good value compared to UK prices and did just what it said on the tin!! Breakfast was a great spread and could be taken indoors or out - we didn't have much as had to rush off to the airport but what we did have was very good and omelettes etc could be cooked if requested.  If I have one gripe it was over dinner. As we were only staying for one night we decided to just eat in the the hotel restaurant. There was a good atmosphere and the staff were very obliging. My issue is with the food. There is a choice of 2 menus - traditional moroccan and western - steak and fish etc. After a week of tajines we decided to choose the western menu. The moroccan menu is better value and possibly we should have stuck with that. There was actually nothing wrong with the food we had - it was just drenched in pepper! I don't consider myself to have a particularly great palate but even I could tell the whole dinner was covered in pepper. There was loads on my starter and i thought perhaps it was a blip but the main course was the same. Maybe the chef was having a bad day but I couldn't understand it. Perhaps I should have sent the food back and given them an opportunity to put things right so I am at fault for that but certainly I found it very strange. Also the portions are huge so bear this in mind!

For example on day 2 spur of the moment we thought after breakfast to take a trip to the atlas mountains (which I'd highly recommend) within an hour a minibus was there. The hotel puts on a free shuttle into the city centre throughout the day and night which was invaluable.    I don't sit by a pool normally but the setting with a lovely pool hot sun and the snow covered atlas mountains in the distance was stunning.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Notwhite wrote a review Mar 2012,40,Fantastic Hotel for kicking back and chillaxing.........,"A little way out of town (but you do have their own shuttle that will take you in and collect you up to 11 Pm brilliaant) and a tad too far to walk but that is a good thing after the hussle n bussle of the city you will really appreciate the silence and peace which is occasionally broken by the sound of a rose petal falling to the ground.  You can hear your heart beating...  When booking seriously consider one of the suites these are located in the grounds of this unassuming charming hotel.  The suites 2 mini and 2 full have their own pools so if you prefer your relaxing or swimming in the privacy of your own garden then this is for you the mini suites are more than adequate whereas the full suites give you an additional living area - larger gardens and a bigger pool both these suites are the furthest away from the main hotel and communal (if you can call it that) approx 5 couples lounge here although it will take 14 - 20 couples easily with space around you.  The only time you really hear anyone making that French noise thing (quite a lot of French) but just as many Brits - is at meal times.  Lunch is satisfying - the restaurant like everywhere else in the hotel is clean and tidy nothing really to write home about (oh i am !) the food is enjoyable but you will get bored after a few days as the menu is not very expressive of the region or area and limited.  That said there are one or two things that will make you go OOOOH! MMMM! WOW!  The staff are very very nice so polite and they seem to really enjoy their work which is to please you - very gratifying. Note to self ""breakfast finishes at 10 sharp""  Anyway back to the suite A bar which is brilliant as there is a supermarket not too far away go there on your way back from the City its on the way the supermarket is located in a shopping mall near where the fomula one track is being built.  There are lots of shops buy some alcohol along with snacky bits and you will save enough to pay for the difference in the suite.  So you have your booze snacks etc in your bar area as you step into your space undeprived suite 2 big sofas and a flat screen Tv with Dvd player you can get Dvds from reception - no charge looking out through 2 massive doors into your private garden with a high wall even if those outside (the other guests that is)wanted to look over they would have to get a ladder ITS PRIVATE.  Another sofa outside and a massive lounger to seat or lay 4 people ??? you figure...  Walk past the mini fridge where you can keep you strawberries cool next to your beers you just bought through to the bedroom very large bed facing another flat screen and Dvd player both mounted on the wall facing the bed or you could sit on the settee at the base of the bed to watch TV very large sliding patio doors overlooking the pool which at night is lit up along with the rest of the garden - it is beautiful.  His and hers separate built in wardrobes leading to the bathroom his n hers taps very large Jacuzzi bath with sliding windows that you just have to open while bathing its like bathing outside! superb - walkin shower separate Wc.  Overall - the finish is definitely not polished as the look is shabby shic the floral arrangements when they turn the bed down every night is a pleasant sight a young establishment that has still to grow up but like our kids they have different amazing memories as they grow up.",Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"D√ºsseldorf, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Notwhite
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,JustUs57 wrote a review Mar 2012,40,Most comfortable bed ever!,We stayed at Sirayane for a week and really enjoyed our time there. The rooms are nice and very spacious. The shower was amazing- huge and powerful and the bed was so big you could lose your partner in it! Luxury linen too. The pool area is lovely and the sunbeds are like a real bed too! We ate in the restaurant a few times and found the food to be generally good. The European menu was very good but pricey. The staff were excellent especially in the restaurant.  We used the shuttle bus and found it perfect for what we needed. Tip: book a later bus back because by the time you've got lost trying to find where you are going you'll need to run to get the earlier one!,Date of stay: February 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cheltenham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JustUs57
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,OoKCINoO wrote a review Mar 2012,50,Wonderful end to a week in Marrakech!,(Feb 27 2012) My partner and I were greeted by the very friendly shuttle driver in the Djemaa el Fna who drove us the 15 minutes or so to the Sirayane Boutique. From the moment we walked into the building I knew it was something special. Within minutes the ‚Äòhotel‚Äô owner greeted us and we were sipping mint tea in foyer whist the reception staff checked us in. We were both made to feel very welcome. I say ‚Äòhotel‚Äô as it doesn‚Äôt really feel like one. I chose to stay here to mark the end to a week long first time trip to the wonderful city of Marrakech and because it was close to the airport It really is a wonderful place to stay and relax especially after a week in the vibrant Medina!! The staff are extremely friendly and will do anything they can to help without being at all intrusive. Its very spacious and the service very personal. The spa is very nice and the prices are reasonable compared to what you would pay in the UK. The standard rooms (which are more like bungalows with a personal garden with access to to the pool) are contemporary well equipped spacious and comfortable. The free shuttle service into the city was excellent as even on our last night we couldn‚Äôt stay away from the Djemaa el Fna and had to go one last time for a lamb tagine. The included buffet breakfast was very nice. It was lovely to eat sat in the warm sun around the pool with a view of the snow-covered Atlas Mountains in the distance‚Ä¶ and all in February! The outdoor heated pool was very welcome as the unheated pool was still a bit chilly. Perfect for couples looking for a bit of winter sun and would recommend it as a last night to anybody wanting to mark the end of a true Marrakech experience with a little bit of relaxation and Luxury.,Date of stay: February 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Worcester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OoKCINoO
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Owen S wrote a review Mar 2012,50,Beautiful serene hotel amongst the madness of Marrakech,My girlfriend and I stayed at the wonderful Sirayane for 3 nights at the end of February. We found the staff to be really polite and helpful and the hotel and surroundings beautiful.    Our break was full of lovely small touches that really made our stay fantastic from the flowers in the room and petals on the bed to the odd chat with the owner who was very keen to ensure that we were enjoying our time in the hotel. I wish we'd had longer to enjoy the wonderful facilities but an action packed 4 days wasn't enough for all we wanted to do.    On our 3rd day we organised a trip to L'Ourika Valley through the hotel concierge and found our driver to be really friendly and helpful.    The shuttle in to the city was absolutely ideal and the food we ate in the hotel restaurant was the tastiest we had all weekend.    Literally cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

Hotel very modern and stylish with a very chilled out atmosphere (and owner - who was happy to chat and get to know the guest... nice touch!). Service food and staff were all absolutely perfect.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Richard F wrote a review Feb 2012,50,"Beautiful, stylish contrast to the madness of Marrakech",The hotel is very stylish service second to none. Very useful minibus shuttle a number of times each day into Medina. Hammam and massage were heavenly.  My only issue was that we chose the few days in February when the weather was colder than they usually expect in Morocco and the hotel wasn't quite geared up for it being that cold. We managed to shelter from the cold wind and sunbath by the pool one day - they also have an outside heated pool.  5* for value as we bought a Groupon deal.,Date of stay: February 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Newark-on-Trent, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/471RichardF

Rooms - the rooms/buildings are very well finished and on par with most 4/5* European hotels. Where there is also free wi-fi throughout which was reliable.  Location - 15mins from the central souk the hotel runs a free shuttle service approx every 45mins.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,susan s wrote a review Feb 2012,50,Wonderful Hotel - Perfect in every way,I could find no fault with this hotel.  The service was exceptional - the staff couldn't do enough for you -from the poolside staff who were there in an instant to reposition your umbrella before you could do it yourself to the ladies who kept the rooms so spotlessly clean.The food was wonderful the spa so relaxing. The owner was there everyday to check his guests were happy - I must congratulate him in everyway  a magnificent hotel.  Position of the hotel was just outside the city a wonderful oasis to return to after a visit into the hustle and bustle of the old town (bus provided by the hotel).  Paddle tennis court at the hotel was fun.  Hotel will advise and book excursions for you - we went on a trip to the Atlas Mountains - guide was brilliant also quad biking was fun.  Make sure you go to the Kosybar and settle yourself on the top terrace when the sun is going down and watch the storks flying in to their nests on the old city walls. Have your camera at the ready - fabulous sight.  Book a table for dinner at Yacout deep in the heart of the medina - Marrakech's old quarter- listed in the book '1000's places to see before you die' you won't be disapointed. Make sure you have a guide to take you as you would surely get lost.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Elaine H wrote a review Feb 2012,50,A feel-good hotel,"The running of this hotel is faultless. ""How do you find your superb staff?"" I asked the owner who with great courtesy welcomes the guests personally and chats to them about their stay. ""It's no great secret"" he replied ""I make sure I treat them well pay them well and ensure they feel a part of the whole enterprise that they are happy in their work."" Not rocket science but in how many hotels do you find every single employee beaming helpful responsive from the front of house manageress to the room maid? Even in the best hotels there's always a blip somewhere. Here I can honestly say the management was seamless. As the owner pointed out without good staff his enterprise would founder. This one deserves to succeed. I stayed in the hotel for five days and saw that it operates as a kind of large family with no sense at all of a pecking order. The facilities are excellent; the accommodation is arranged in such a way as to give all guests their own space - well-appointed 'suites' with their own garden or balcony separated from the next in such a way that noise from other guests is never a problem. The hotel complex is well-designed with two out-door swimming pools one heated plenty of lounge space and a good restaurant with an interesting range of Moroccan and international food. The hotel is a 15 minute drive from the medina which would put some people off but we found being out of the city a bonus: we had the best of both worlds - the colourful noisy chaotic hubbub of central Marrakech during the day and the peace and calm of this excellent hotel in the evening. The hotel provides a free shuttle bus service that takes you in and out of the medina at intervals during the day and evening. In fact we shared our time more or less exactly between hotel and the centre of Marrakech taking advantage of the superb spa facilities and just sitting by the pool or on the terrace reading our books. I shall definitely return.",Date of stay: January 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElaineH369
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,maryhinks wrote a review Feb 2012,50,A beautiful oasis of calm,I have just returned from a 5 night stay at this hotel and it was honestly one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had. It was hard to find fault with anything at all but what stood out the most was the welcoming and friendly staff who bent over backwards to make our stay a memorable one. Aziza the Guest Relations Manager and Anas the Restaurant Manager were particularly friendly and attentive. We also had the pleasure of meeting the owner who went out of his way to greet us and ask us about our stay.    In terms of location this hotel is about a 10 minute drive from the centre of Marrakech (there are free shuttle buses from the hotel that will drop you off and pick you up later) so it's not at the heart of the hustle and bustle. This was actually a plus for us because it meant that we could escape the noise and pollution of Marrakech for somewhere much quieter and more peaceful.    Food at the hotel was excellent (I recommend the tagines) if slightly pricey but worth it.    I will definitely be recommending this hotel to my family and friends - and I will definitely be returning!

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Paradise908 wrote a review Jan 2012,50,Heaven on Earth!!!,I don't think I have a single bad thing to say about this hotel. I stayed here with my wife and son for 5 nights in the last week of November and I didn't regret a single penny spent there. We were picked from the airport and upon arriving at the hotel we were welcomed by the owner and the gorgeous mangeress. The hotel Is designed beautifully with great taste. We were given pastries and tea while we waited in the reception and then were shown around the hotel facilities before being taken to our room. The room was beautiful a good size and I loved the design. We had our own private swimming pool which was kept heated and clean during our stay. The maids always left flower patterns whenever we returned from the city.    Throughout the stay the staff were attentive and the service was excellent. T.v. Channels are a little limited only 1 or 2 being English but I didn't go there to watch t.v. So wasn't too fussed about that. Breakfast was lovely they had a wide variety and plenty of choice. Having breakfast with a excellent view of the atlas mountains was calming and refreshing. Could have sat there all day.    Hotel is perfectly located. After spending a day in the busy hustle and bustle of the city it's a relief to return to the peace and tranquility of the hotel. It's about a 10 to 15 minute drive from the city.    Would definatley return and recommend to anyone visiting Marrakech.,Date of stay: November 2011,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paradise908
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,london_travel_guru wrote a review Jan 2012,40,Beautiful hidden gem,Located about 15 mins outside the main town centre this lovely hotel provides a complimentary shuttle service to and from the town centre. This means that sitting around the heated pool there is absolutel silence which is very very nice.  The restaurant in the hotel serves excellent food with a good range on the menu and along with a great bar and lounge area (with open fire in the winter) it is easy to while away the evenings.  The rooms are very new and very well fitted out with rainfall showers and air conditioning / heating (for the colder nights).  The staff are very helpful - although one or two speak no english so sometimes a little tricky to communicate but there is always another staff member around to step in and help.  I would highly recommend this hotel for a few days away - we spent two days round the pool and two days shopping in the town centre and this hotel was perfect.,Date of stay: November 2011,Trip type: Traveled on business,West London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/london_travel_guru

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,GeorginaSmallF wrote a review Jan 2012,40,Fantastic for relaxing,I stayed at the Siryana for three nights at the end of November with my partner. We just wanted a few relaxing days away.    Despite a very delayed flight our pre-arranged driver was waiting to take us to the hotel. A very nice check-in experience with mint tea and biscuits followed by a tour of the hotel.  Our room was nice but disappointing as we didn‚Äôt really have a view. There was a problem with the air conditioning unit but this was fixed straight away. The beds were very comfortable and gave a great nights sleep and the shower was fantastic. We had complementary water and biscuits in the room. The design of the hotel is really nice and the pool and sun beds are great. The bar is also a nice place to chill out in the evening with nice snacks and cocktails. Wifi was only really usable around the bar and lounge areas which was slightly disappointing but not the end of the world and is a very good selling point to this hotel.    Breakfast (which was included in the price) had a very good selection. We ate dinner in the hotel once and ate off the Moroccan menu. It was nice but not outstanding for the price. So we opted to eat out the following nights. After reading another review on here we opted for stall number 75 and the food was good value and tasted amazing we ate like kings! I also recommend getting a fresh orange juice when visiting the square in the day time ‚Äì so cheap and delicious!    We booked a hamam & massage which lasted around 1h4 45 mins. This was a fun experience and was worth it. Although I didn‚Äôt think that it was quite a 5 star spa experience. The robes were quite worn out and the massage was pleasant (not outstanding) but the therapist kept changing the music which was very distracting and un-professional.    We used the free shuttle bus into town and back on several occasions and they were clean with good drivers. It is a very good service as the hotel is quite a way out of town it is really needed. It was wonderful to return to the peace and calm of the hotel after a day in town and I was quite glad that we were 15/20mins out of town the hotel setting was just so relaxing with gorgeous views of the Atlas mountains.    On our last day we were allowed a late checkout at no extra cost and we enjoyed a really good lunch by the pool. Actually much better than the dinner.    All in all I would recommend this hotel for a relaxing and romantic break it is a really lovely hotel. The staff are all very friendly and provide a great service. I think I would have preferred one more night there as I was really starting to relax when it was time to come home.    This hotel is great and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I don't think it compares to some of the 5 stars I have stayed in in Europe. But it is probably 5 star for Morocco and I would return.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,eddiefinch wrote a review Dec 2011,50,Stunning hotel!,This week-long holiday in Marrakech was a 30th birthday present from my girlfriend - and what a present it was! The Sirayane and its staff made this one of the best holidays I have ever experienced! I cannot thank them enough! We went in the middle of December and the 22-24 degree heat was a welcome break from the minus temperatures and snow of our home city of Bradford. First impressions of the hotel and the service provided started well and kept getting better - their driver met us at the airport and whisked us away from the bustling city centre a short drive out to the Sirayane set in tranquil countryside overlooking the stunning Atlas mountains. We were met by the relationship manager who sat us down in the relaxing reception area for some Moroccan mint tea and local pastries while we checked in and had our bags taken to the room - nice touch! We were then given a tour of the hotel and spa which is a newly built modern complex with a very stylish layout and design following both European and local influences. It is a lovely environment for a relaxing chilled out stay. We were then taken to the room - wow! We were given a balcony room on the 1st floor overlooking the pool and a stunning view of sweeping countryside with the snow-covered peaks of the Atlas peering through the mist in the distance! A bottle of red wine and more pastries were waiting for us and we spent a nice afternoon in the sun on the balcony reflecting on a mind-blowing reception! The rooms are modern stylish and clean. The bathroom was spacious and stunning a sizeable TV was provided with local and international channels including several English channels. A dvd player was also provided and reception stocked a selection of films you could borrow throughout the stay. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff during our stay and they were polite and attentive without being overbearing. The owner of the hotel popped in and came up to us to introduce himself during dinner before leaving us to it - I can't remember another hotel where this happened and I can see from Tripadvisor reviews that he responds directly to every mention of dissatisfaction - this sums up the attention to detail of this hotel. An example of this is that whenever we booked a table for dinner they obviously noted the time and the maids made our bed in different styles with petals and towel-doves each time we were away - a lovely touch ! The complimentary hammam was great the nex morning in a really nice spa complex. We spent several relaxing afternoons by the pools one of which was unheated and too cold at this time of year to use. The heated pool was great though. Breakfast was a great selection of continental and local cuisine whilst lunch and dinner were also available with European and Moroccan menus. We ate mostly from the Moroccan menu and the food was excellent. The hotel is situated about 10 minutes drive from Marrakech centre. There is a regular free shuttle bus to and from the hotel which must be pre-booked. The hotel will also pick you up or take you anywhere for a price which we utilised when an expedia excursion we had booked came to a premature end and we were left stranded in the middle of the city at midnight. We called the hotel and they sent someone to pick us up straight away! The medina and city were fascinating but exhausting and it was nice that the hotel was outside the city - you were able to get away from the hustle and bustle and the hassling from local beggars and sellers back to the peaceful and relaxing surroundings of the Sirayane. The bar was also nice and stocked a wide selection of fine wines beers and spirits. A free and fast wi-fi connection was also provided as well as a PC in the library area should you need it. There was also a tennis court if you fancied it and gym - which I didn't use once :). Overall I really cannot do this hotel justice in words I would seriously recommend it to anyone. The only one thing I would say was that it is a 5 star hotel and that comes with a price. We got it on a Groupon deal but eating and drinking in the hotel is a lot more expensive than the city centre. It was worth it though as unlike some places the service and standards match the pricetag and you never felt like you didn't get what you paid for - what a great experience!,Date of stay: December 2011,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eddiefinch
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Mamta R wrote a review Dec 2011,50,Bargain relaxing retreat,Well I have been to Marrakech once before and stayed in the Medina. I was not a big fan- especially because of the hustle and bustle. Staying at Sirayane gives you the opportunity to truly get away relax in serene peaceful surroundings and enjoy the sunshine (even in december it is warm enough to sunbathe during the day though you need a jacket at night.)    Marrakech is a million worlds away from the UK and I really feel like I have had a break rested and can't believe its only been 3 nights away! If you lead a busy life in London a long weekend away to Sirayane will leave you refreshed and revitalised and empowered to face the world that was making you weary and tired!    The hotel itself is amazing. It is a good 20 mins from the centre but they have several shuttles a day that make it easy to head into town (we went back and forth with an afternoon break). It is situated in quiet desert like landscape and is built in clay like most of the other buildings in Marrakech. It is luxurious without being ostentatious.    The best thing is the peace and quiet. The spa is great too. We had a free treatment at the hammam which was very relaxing.    The food is lovely and flavoursome and you don't have to ever leave the resort if you just want to relax It has a boutique feel enabling it to be non-corporate feeling.    If you do want to enjoy the madness of marrakech and the night markets restaurants etc you can do so only to return to your haven once more!!    I read one of the more negative reviews and yes- the library is not great (books/ dvds) but you can bring your own (not blue ray) and watch away to your hearts content in the very comfortable rooms. Breakfast has great coffee and many fresh juices. The pastries are devine    The shower in our room wasn't great and we let them know at reception. Immediately it was sorted!    This is a great deal on living social. I don't know what the full price is but for what we paid we got a lot more than expected.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,DianeW64 wrote a review Nov 2011,50,Cheap deal.,Got this holiday at a discounted price through Groupon. Was totally amazed when we arrived to find it really was everything it professed to be. We were collected at the airport for a small charge and quickly taken to the hotel. The bedroom was massive with a big private balcony the bathroom was divided into separate areas enabling one person to shower and another to get dressed or use the loo.  On the first night we decided to eat in the hotel not really expecting to be thrilled but the choices were very diverse and we chose a tagine the local traditional food. Everything including the service was of a very high quality. The breakfast was of a buffet style and again was excellent.  The hotel is about 9 kilometres from the centre of Marrakech but this is not problematic because the hotel provide a free shuttle service very regularly throughout the day. The entire staff at the hotel are very friendly professional and helpful nothing is too much trouble. There is a spa and in the holiday deal we received a free hammam my friend had a full body massage treatment which she described as the most relaxing and best massage she had ever had. We ate again at the hotel and chose food from the other menu this food was perfect the starter and main course dishes were fantastic no room for a sweet. There is an outdoor swimming pool one part of it is heated the seating area around it is calm and restful. The sun beds are comfortable and there is a large towel on each bed. There is a gym the equipment needs some attention as there are faults on each piece but it gave me a good excuse not to use it!  My only complaint was there was only one excursion book available we had wanted to visit the Atlas mountains and the book had been given to other guests they kept it for two days. Without the book we were unable to see the options available and the Receptionist was unable to remember the prices and the details. I feel they lost our business because of this as we booked our trip in the Souks which did not go entirely as planned but we got there in the end.  Would recommend this hotel and it's fantastic service I forgot to mention the owner he is on hand throughout asking about your stay and the service you are receiving would visit again and again.,Date of stay: November 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Leicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianeW64
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Shaz_Rod wrote a review Nov 2011,50,Amazing place!,This may sound like a clich√© but we found the Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa in Marrakech to be an oasis in the desert. Set against the backdrop of the Atlas Mountains this is one of Morocco‚Äôs true hidden gems.    15 minutes by car from the airport and Jemaa El Fna (main town) the Sirayane is far enough from the hustle and bustle of the market square and souks but with numerous free shuttle services put on by the hotel you can be in the thick of things in no time at all.    We stayed for a week and thoroughly enjoyed being there; the staff and management are uncompromising in the level and quality of service provided. The food is good with both Moroccan and international cuisine options. The hotel is modern and elegant; we were spoilt for choice with two swimming pools (one heated) a tennis court gym spa treatments & hammam (heavenly!) and three luxurious lounge areas (one with a bar ‚Äì they do a mean pina colada!). The Sirayane is incredibly spacious whilst remaining intimate. It‚Äôs in a league of its own and is nothing like the busy resorts that most tourists will stay at. If you‚Äôre looking for a truly unique and relaxing experience with value for money then you should definitely consider staying here.    We would highly recommend the Sirayane and wouldn‚Äôt fault a thing except that out stay had to come to an end. We are already looking forward to going back!,Date of stay: November 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shaz_Rod
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Sharon R wrote a review Nov 2011,50,I left my heart in Marrakech x,My husband and I got a fabulous groupon deal for our anniversary so no children to run around after. when our flight landed in the evening we could not find our hotel taxi and like most locals from this beautiful city the airport staff could not have been more helpful they put a call out over the tannoy and within a few minutes our driver appeared to help us to the car. After a 10 min ride to the hotel we where greeted at reception wth pastries and mint tea whilst staff sorted everything else behind the scenes allowing us to relax and soak up the ambience of this beautiful hotel. The decor of the hotel is very calming and minimilistic and as I have a passion for interiors this was right up my street. We were lucky enough to get a garden room which was only a few steps to the pool and the fabulous double loungers allowing us to enjoy the warm sunshine. I dont think the white plastic ones in Spain will ever feel the same and to be honest I feel Spain could learn from the service we experienced whilst at the Sirayane. Nothing was ever a problem and it was a lovely relaxing experience with a personal service that never felt intrusive. I would like to personally thank Adile the night manager who was very knowledgable and proud of his home city. He gave us lot's of great information and always guided us in the right direction and is an absolute credit to the hotel and it's owners again nothing was ever to much trouble. It was lovely to have the contrast of the hustle bustle of the medina against the chilled out vibe of the Sirayane and with the free transfers it was always nice to come back to the tranquility of the hotel. We had a few spa treatments that I would recommend but would suggest that you ask the therapist to explain the treatment up front so that she doesn't miss anything out. Food and drink was nice and as with most places in Marrakech alcohol was expensive. I would go as far as to say that this was probably one of my favourite holidays we felt really safe in the medina and loved the culture and history of Marrakech. From the warm welcome of the locals to the buzzing nightlife of the medina I actually enjoyed it more than I expected to and really cannot recommend it hightly enough! I would go back in a heartbeat although fear that without a great deal from groupon it may just be out of my reach. I would like to thank Sirayane for the lovely memory of our anniversary and the nice glass of champagne we hope to see you again soon!!!,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharonR724
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,MJ62_11 wrote a review Nov 2011,50,A hotel to keep as your own special secret!,We had a fabulous relaxing stay at the Sirayane - we booked it via a Groupon voucher and jokingly said that if it wasn't up to much we hadn't spent a lot of money on it and would stay somewhere else! The hotel is lovely - large wooden doors opening into high celiing'd rooms: low furniture and all quite minimalist. The attention to service and detail is very impeccable from the relaxed seated check-in where tea and pastries were served to the walk round and shown the amenities so no time was wasted trying to find them to the sprinkling of fresh rose petals on our sheets each evening. The hotel clearly prides itself on the personal approach - on our first day a man stopped by our lunch table to introduce himself - it was the owner: that's the level of service at the Sirayane: personal but not intrusive. You could easily spend all of your Marrakech trip at the Sirayane relaxing on the divans by the pool or in the spa - it's hard to believe it is only ten minutes from the hustle and bustle of the souk and Medina!,Date of stay: November 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MJ62_11
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Karen B wrote a review Nov 2011,50,Fabulous find!,Have just returned from a 5 day break at the Sirayane Hotel and my first trip to Morocco. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. The hotel arranged for a private transfer and when we arrived at the hotel were greeted with mint tea and pastries whilst we checked in - a perfect start to our trip! Our luggage was taken to our room whilst we were shown around the hotel and spa areas. Our room was clean and spacious with robes and slippers provided. The standard of the food served was excellent - great variety at breakfast with made to order omlettes available lots of fresh juices fruit pastries cheeses etc.. The waiters were incredibly attentive without being intrusive and took the time to run through the menu explaining the dishes to us. I can recommend the tagines and the house wine! Both food and wine were also incredibly good value for money. The pool area is lovely with large 'day beds' with shades available and the smaller pool is heated. We also had a hamman treatment in the spa which was fantastic - the therapists in the spa were really personable. There was a lounge area with a computer set up with free internet access and also a real fire which was lit each evening. I was very impressed with the free shuttle service into town which operated up until 11:15pm - we did get a cab back one night which was 150 dirhams. I loved the fact that the hustle & bustle of the Djemaa El Fna was only 15 mins away from the relaxed atmosphere at the Sirayane - what a contrast!! Nothing appeared to be too much trouble with staff going out of their way to ensure that our trip was perfect. I will definitely be a return visitor to the Sirayane :),Date of stay: November 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenbS1420SK
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Ilovetravel2104 wrote a review Nov 2011,50,Luxurious with every need fulfilled,Me and my friend returned yesterday (two females aged 23 & 24) from Marrakech we were staying at the Sirayane Hotel from start to finish it was fantastic we were met at the airport by our friendly hotel transfer straight into air - conditioned vehicle arrived at the hotel was seated and served Mint tea and pastries - great introduction already - not the usual stress of booking in thankfully we were then given a tour of the hotel and its grounds - beautiful calm serene - everything you could ask for in a relaxing break then we were delivered to our room where the cases we already waiting - GREAT!! the hotel is a bit further out of the hustle and bustle of the Medina but the hotel provides free transfers to and from town throughout the day until 11.15 at night. The staff were very pleasant but not overbearing would not hassle you for anything bear this in mind as if you want a drink by the pool you just need to ask - they thankfully dont ask you every minute as if pressuring you now to the pool great sun filled all day - two pools one heated one not also the double lounger sun beds just great and comfortable for wasting the day away in the sunshine. We had lunch and cocktails on the first day alll which can be charged to your room - no fussing with money :) cocktails were great but very strong - might of been the sun and lunch classic chicken salad was well presented and tasty then dinner the first night we stayed in the hotel nice menu to pick from both european and morocco menus we went for the latter - starters and a tegine for main - lovely next day arranged transfer to the medina 4 transfers in total for the day went shopping in the medina must have a strong head on you for this and prepare to barter within an inch of your life came out laden with shopping bags having a Orange Juice to finish off the morning then back to the hotel for a hamman treatment - lovely spa and staff and my skin has never felt so soft! then at night back to the experience of the medina we had dinner on a balcony restaurant - very cheap but nice food about ¬£15 each no alchol is served within the city walls - but this was ok then we got a henna be careful to try and specify what you want otherwise they will give you something small and expect payement then we took a horse carrige ride - paid 100dh (¬£10 ish) took 40 mins seen the mosque the casino and some of the best hotels in the city. then as it was quieter we had food (yes more) in the market prawns and chicken kebabs (stall no 75) nice and fresh and a good experience. Next day basqued in the sun all day after another lovely breakfast at the hotel - table was laden with pastries breads fruits juices and a lovely made to order Omlette and then with our request we went to Comptoir one of the best eatieries I have visited for ambience - belly dancing music singing and coctails not to mention the food I had a great salmon dish- expensive but worth the experience. Overall a very enjoyable experience with plans already in motion to visit again soon the hotel was fantastic and I would reccomend to all my family and friends- a mean feat as I travel the world for a living and dont reccomend much!! the staff and hotel are so welcoming and just fantastic cannot wait to visit again soon!!

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Elmozza wrote a review Nov 2011,50,Excellent hotel,We stayed here for 4 nights using a Groupon Voucher and I couldn't fault the place at all. The fact we were on a special 'deal' made no difference to the way we were treated.    We arranged a transfer from the airport with the hotel - and despite our flight being delayed the driver was waiting for us upon arrival. When we got the hotel we had mint tea and pastries and had a guided tour of the hotel. The staff were all really friendly and happy to help.    Our room was lovely spotlessly clean and serviced daily. Breakfast was great lots of choice and plentiful. We ate in the restaurant every night and the food was always good whether we ate from the Moroccan menu or the more international one good value for money as well.    The spa was great - our hamam that came as part of the deal was amazing - lasted almost 1.5 hours and we both felt brilliant afterwards. We also used the free shuttle into the Medina which was a brilliant service.    The owner was there a lot during our stay and seemed really keen to talk to guests and find out what they thought.    The pool area was lovely and staff were always available to give out towels or bring drinks from the bar.    The only negative I can think of was that the free wifi was dodgy and we had difficulty connecting most days (and not at all from our room) - but to be honest it was nice to get away from it all so we didn't really miss being online!    A great place to go and relax far enough away from the centre to feel totally away from it all but close enough to go exploring. Highly recommended.,Date of stay: November 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Reading, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elmozza
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,CSafian wrote a review Oct 2011,50,Please Read :-),What can i say about Sirayane - nothing but good things that's what. We were greeted on arrival at 10pm with some mint tea and a smile. The staff were friendly from start to finish.    This was a honeymoon destination for my new wife and I so we were expecting it to be nice and it was. The fact that we had used a 'GroupOn' voucher to go made no difference to the staff. The rooms were lovely and spacious and decorated in a cultural yet modern way. The hotel is far enough out from the city that you are not awoken by any calls to prayer. Breakfast was plentiful and we had lots of choice.    One thing i will say is that the manager appears to read and act on the reviews left on TripAdvisor as one reviewer moaned about the lack of omelettes but they had them while we were there so that's good. Someone else had moaned that the last shuttle bus back was at 10pm whereas it was 11.15pm when we were there.    Seriously i could not fault this hotel - the staff - the food - the rooms - the gardens - the pool - the decor was all top notch and if you can i would visit this hotel - It was my birthday on the day we left so the manager offered us a complimentary glass of bubbly :-),Date of stay: September 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Linlithgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CSafian
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,rosmarLondon wrote a review Oct 2011,50,Relaxing,We recently spent our honeymoon at Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa.  What a fantastic experience staff did everything they could to make our stay memorable and relaxing.    Food in the restaurant is great value and tastes wonderful - something for all tastes. Good breakfast selection. The restaurant/bar has indoor and outdoor seating overlooking a large swimming pool/sunbathing area framed by views of the Atlas mountains.    We had a room with our own swimming pool and jacuzzi ‚Äì great if you want alittle more privacy. The rooms are tastefully decorated clean and tidy.    This is a great place to get away from it all - but also great to take advantage of the hotels free shuttle service to the Medina which takes about 15-20 mins.    Good range of spa treatments available and very professional staff.    Small and boutique this place is perfect for a getway. Not one of these huge impersonal places where you are just a guest. At Sirayane they know your name and the service is personal. We had a great stay.    I would give this gem my strongest recomendation.,Date of stay: September 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosmarLondon
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,cassie7Edinburgh wrote a review Oct 2011,40,Perfect for relaxation,My two friends and I stayed here from 7th to 11th October after staying in Riad Dar One (seperate review) for the first three days. There had been a mix up with our booking and Mehdi upgraded us to a Deluxe suite with a put up bed in the living room. Although this was nice the put up bed wasn't great for an adult. After two nights of my friend not sleeping I mentioned this to Mehdi and he promptly moved my friend to another room which was great. The beds at the pool are the comfiest I have ever experienced. We ate at the Restaurant twice and both times I had steak which was delicious. On my second last day here I became ill with the 'Marrakech stomach bug'. The staff were very helpful and gave my friends some anti sickness tablets and some salt sachets for me. This did really ruin the end of my holiday though and I am still suffering two weeks later (awaiting test results). I am in no way blaming the hotel for this though as I don't know how or where I contracted this. We all had antispetic hand wipes and gel etc. but it still got me!! The courtesy bus runs quite a few times a day to and from the old town which is great. The only down side to living outside the City is that you have to plan in advance what you intend to do the next day in order to book your place on the bus. This takes away some of the spontenaity of your holiday but is probably a small price to pay to have free transport.,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cassie7Edinburgh
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Caroline R wrote a review Oct 2011,30,Nice,This was portrayed as a luxury hotel which it is not. We chose a luxury room with private pool and two other rooms for our adult children and their partners. The breakfast was really excellent with plenty of choiceall the staff where really pleasant and very helpful. There it ended. We live in Spain and go to Morrocco at least five times a year as we love the country and the people this hotel is not a luxury hotel. The food is very poor in quality and taste the rooms where dirty A cockroach was dead on my bedroom floor for the duration of the holiday there where insects in the shower which did not drain and the water was either scalding or cold dangerous. The private pool was very cloudy looking and had it's own wildlife in it and in fact the bottom of the pool was very slimy. I could let go the cracked mirror the broken tap the useless air con and the broken toilet seat but to be charged ¬£2.50 for a bottle of water which I had to go to reception for as the mininbar was not re stocked from day one and then to be charged service on it at 10 per cent my own service! Was a step too far.  Over the years we have had numerous Spas and Hammans but this was the worst by far. It was far too hot so hot to lay on we had to stand up after 5 minutes this was very funny to the girl in charge who just said you are English! She left us 10 minutes then we had the scrub left again then the clay mask left again 10 minutes then told it's finished get a shower. Rubbish! The mini foot spa is wrapping your foot in a towel and two pressure points and then pulling each toe that is it!

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Luiz Lima wrote a review Oct 2011,50,Perfect to explore Marrakech and relax in one go,Sirayane was a lovely surprise in Marrekech. It's a small hotel (28 rooms I believe) with a beautiful spa and fantastic pool. Breakfast is plentiful in a buffet with breads jams fruit cereals and cakes as well as a few hot options including pancakes scrambled eggs etc. The chef will prepare omelettes if you wish but we didn‚Äôt try. Snacks are available throughout the day. We tried the NY burger once and it was very very good. In the evenings the restaurant is a gourmet experience which although not particularly cheap offers fantastic food. My wife tried the spa and loved it. The pool is large and there are enough sunbeds for everybody. The hotel is about 15 minutes away from Marrakech‚Äôs city centre the Medina. There‚Äôs a free transfer service every 90 minutes or so. The drivers drive very responsibly which is not always the case with taxis for example. Transfers to/from the airport are not included but they will arrange it for you if you wish - or you can just take a taxi because it takes less than 10 minutes to get there.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,scottishlass24 wrote a review Oct 2011,40,Lovely contrast to the busy medina,We used a group on voucher to book this hotel and I think the deal was well worth it- the hotel is beautiful I. The middle of nowhere but with luxurious and dramatic decor that makes you feel as if you have found a real oasis. The journey to the medina is also short enough that it is handy to get to and the shuttle bus is very handy. If it is fully booked the staff are also very helpful when arranging transfers in a private vehicle.    The one complaint we did have was that before we travelled the hotel contacted us to say they were overbooked and offered us various options if we were to change dates or cancel nights - of course this was not possible where flights were concerned. They were then very quick to take back their offer of an upgraded room when we explained we could not change dates. However friends travelling at the same time did receive the upgrade to a pool suite having been asked first! This problem did not affect our stay and our room was very nice however it was a bit frustrating to deal with this just before our holiday and the tone of emails was not brilliant. Having said that in person the staff were lovely and charming and they did offer us a free drink on arrival to compensate.    The food in the hotel was very nice plenty of choice for a few day visit and the spa treatment I received a massage was also very relaxing. The pool area is lovely too.    All in all a very nice hotel close enough to make trips to the medina very handy remote enough to feel like you are away from the madness to properly relax. I also absolutely loved Marrakech- it is busy exciting interesting and vibrant a real experience for all the senses.

Breakfasts are buffet style and varied interesting and well-presented. It is delightful to sit out on the terrace before the sun really gets up. Dinners were less good value - the standard Marroccan Tagines and cous-cous at circa ¬£20 per head - but we ate from the (standard international food) bar menu one dayand that was very good. That said the food is all freshly prepared and very well served. Cocktails are a highlight of the drinks menu.

The rooms were clean well-equipped and serviced daily and the breakfast is awesome! We stayed in room 129 - had a private garden but next time I would probably go for the terrace/balcony room for more privacy. The hotel has an efficient shuttle service to the medina but this was on 2 occasions full when we needed it so you will need to book your shuttle well in advance to be able to plan a proper itinerary. We tried to book the night before and it was already full so lots of advance planning will help you and save you a small fortune. Maybe the hotel could also consider adding more regular and frequent shuttles. We also got to meet with the owner on the last day and this was lovely gesture.

Lovely background music (which was different each day). Lunch was delicious as were the cocktails I would recommend the mojito royal expensive but worth it! We didn't book the free shuttle but there was no problem arranging transfers to and from Marrakech in the evening at 20 euros each way it's about what we pay at home to head to the centre of town.

We arranged a pick up at the airport by the Sirayane Taxi from the Widiane Hotel taxi - the Sirayane was waiting for us. Apologies but $20 does not seem expensive for c9km ride. We had a lovely garden room - these have a reasonably private sitting out area - but we sat by the pool most of the three days we were there.    We have visited Marrakech before (the first time 42 years ago!) so although a much pleasanter place now with little hassle a late afternoon and evening in a restaurant was sufficient. Maybe we would have done more but the temperature had returned to the high 30s low 40s more usual in Late July/August (local staff commented on how hot it was).    The taxi to town ran right to time a great transfer without problems. I would agree that the food and drink was a little expensive - the 10% service pushing the prices a little. A more flexible evening menu would have been welcome - two courses are a minimum. The free Hamman was not particularly good if that was normal service when paying then I think I would have been disappointed.    But those are the few down sides. The upsides are a lovely room (had a DVD player built into the flat screen TV) good shower etc. And then there are the excellent pools and the even more excellent service from the two pool boys who were ever attentive to ensuring the parasols were moved to give the shade we desired. Breakfast was a very nice meal lots of choice sitting outside watching the local birds skipping around for the crumbs.    Our last day we were able to stay by the pool until 19.00 although our room was given up at 12.00 a shower changing and luggage storage was readily available before we departed.    Really recommended especially at ¬£113 for two per night. And thank you to the owner for meeting us as we departed a very nice touch.,Date of stay: September 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"York, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulBartlett
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Shahid R wrote a review Sep 2011,50,Looking for Heaven on Earth - this is it !!,Just got back last night (13th sept). Hotel is slightly out of Marrakesh and the free shuttle gets you to the Jemaa Fna in around 10 mins. Only problem is when trying to get another part of Marrakesh you need to rely on the hotel taxi (which is expensive !!)  The Hotel should have a courtesy taxi/coach to bring guests from and take to the airport as with many 5* hotels. Otherwise you either have to haggle with the taxi drivers or pay extortionate fares. We were quoted MAD 250 (¬£20) but managed to haggle down to MAD 150 (¬£13) which was still a lot considering you can get a taxi from the airport to centre of Marrakesh for around MAD 50 (¬£4). Petite taxis don't go to this hotel because of the area its in ......so you'll need a grande (mercedes) taxi to get there.    The staff at the hotel are brilliant and I think this is what makes the hotel the luxury heaven it is. The 'pool' guy requires special mention as he is the most hard-working and helpful guy I have ever met in Marrakesh !!!!    We ate dinner at the Hotel food was of good quality but a wee bit on the high price. Breakfast could do with some extra selections of items and would be helpful if replenished on time instead of asking for something (which was brought out to when asked).    The rooms themselves were reasonable except the flowers etc made a hugh difference. Would be helpful if there was a full size mirror in the bedroom for my wife to check out her dress and shoes at the same time. Room service was quick and hot and very good quality and price.    What else ?? just a couple of recommendations - some on-site entertainment and room service until maybe 3-4am wouldn't go a miss.    Couple of other things don't eat at the Al-Hambra restaurant in Jemma al Fna market as the food is disgusting and as always agree a price before paying for anything.    All in all great hotel great staff and the owner (Mehdi) made us feel welcome and genuinely cared about our stay.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,1CMR wrote a review Sep 2011,50,A haven of tranquility,Sirayane is a beautiful hotel on the outskirts of Marrakech. The rooms are luxurious with a fabulous bathroom and shower. The rooms all overlook the tranquil pool many with their own private garden. This hotel is absolutely perfect for those that want a relaxing holiday whilst still within easy access of the hustle and bustle of downtown Marrakech. The free bus shuttle service makes getting in and out of town so easy without the hassle of haggling with taxi drivers. The staff are extremely welcoming and will organise any aspect of your holiday if you wish. Booking restaurants taxis or day trips are all handled efficiently and always with a smile.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Paul G wrote a review Sep 2011,50,Scintillating Sirayane,Just returned yesterday from a week at this hotel. The staff were excellent and very attentive to the point of even moving the sun parasols by the sun beds to keep them in the shade throughout the day without needing to be asked. If you want to relax this is the place to go. Being outside of Marrkech and the hotel puts on a free shuttle bus at various times in and out means you can escape the hustle of Marrkech and kick back and relax. Rooms were a very good size with great bathrooms. The owner was around most days and always stopped to have a chat and ask how everything was going and how the staff were doing. He even extended our checkout as our flight was not until 6:30pm so gave us the room til 3pm. This meant we had another day by the pool without having to rush or checkout early and sit around. Very much appreciated.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,cattls wrote a review Aug 2011,50,very excellent stay,"We recently returned from a truly magical 2-nights stay at the Sirayane!  We arrived in the late evening and were greeted by the very friendly hotel reception staff he asked us to sit down whilst he prepared the registration paperwork. Later on another staff brought us a lovely pot of Moroccan mint tea and homemade biscuits. A lovely touch and we felt like we were greeted as king and queen. I won't forget to mention that the hotel interior itself is very grandieur I love it to pieces!    The rooms are of an excellent standard with a modern design and decor. I love the small details they put in the room the fresh rose petals scattered over fresh linen.  And this was re-done every day (they even did it twice on one day).    We tried the restaurant in our first night and we loved our food! (Appetizer+Main meal+Half bottle of Rose cost us 60 euros for two). Of course we would love it if it's slightly cheaper than that but hey we paid for the good quality of food so I won't complain here.    The hotel provides a free shuttle service into the centre of Marrakech at set times throughout the day and the evening. Do remember to book it in advance otherwise it gets full easily. Since we arrived late and the receptionist did not advise us on the shuttle bus so we only managed to book shuttle pretty late and were not able to choose our preferred timing. Would be nice if the receptionist has advised us on this when we checked-in.    We also tried the spa - Oriental massage and we got promo weekend deal buy 1 get 2 and it was a very good deal. Nice massage (although I am used to get stronger massage in my own country but since the masseuse cannot speak English well I did not even bother to start asking).  We wanted to try the 2nd spa experience on Sunday but were ripped-off by a tour guide the day before so we decided to cancel the 2nd massage there.    Speaking about tour - in case you want to do this please note that you are in Morocco. Even though the hotel arranges the tour guide for you and it's 5 stars hotel we are in we apparently can never trust any guide in Morocco! The receptionist booked us a guide for the following day and since we didn't get any warning we were in full faith during the tour assuming that we can trust our guide completely. The tour was supposed to take 4 hours but the guide only accompanied us for 2 hours (!) Worst part is that we did not get to see anything but shops! He brought us to Marrakech market and pushed us into 4-5 different shops in that market. Every time we stopped in a souvenir stall inside the market he kept telling us to keep on walking because he would bring us to a better shop with better deals. after accompanying us for 2 hours he then said ""my time with you is finished. please pay me and I will go"" - we paid him 300 dirhams and later we found out half day tour should only cost us 100-150 dirhams!!    After he left us we walked around the market ourselves and found out that we were completely ripped-off with the price from the last shop. Lost 700 dirhams and we're sure some of that went into his pocket as commission!  We had a long discussion with the hotel about this as we had full faith in the hotel to recommend the best guide but apparently things work differently in Morocco and hotel is not fully responsible for the guide arrangements.    I have to mention that Sirayane staff were trying very hard to make it up with us. They gave us free tour the next day and allowed us for late check-out. Even the owner came to apologize offered us drinks and refunded tour guide fee of 300 dirhams. Very lovely though we still hope the receptionist takes more initiative to warn the guests on guides in Morocco beforehand so such occasion will never happen again.  Receptionist should also advise us the right price for the tour (half day or full day) if they are the ones arranging half day shuttle arrangement for us.    Even though we didn't get our 1000 dirhams back (from what we bought at the shop) we tried hard to keep enjoying our short stay at Sirayane. On Saturday after the stupid tour it was difficult we were in such bad mood and even had a fight due to this.  But on Sunday we felt better because all the staff reacted to our complaints positively and we left Sirayane with smile in our faces.    We eventually did not take the refunded tour guide money with us as we checked-out and gave that as tips to the staff.  I especially wanna thank all staff at Sirayane again for this wonderful stay. Including those who decorate our room and put fresh rose over our linen the masseuse and the guys who helped us at the pool!

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Tom R wrote a review Aug 2011,40,Fantastic for the cheap deal we had,If the rating would be relative to the price we paid (think we had a 50% off deal) I would definitely be giving 5/5.    The hotel is really what it says it is - an amazingly peaceful retreat from the madness of Marrakech centre. I have to say from our experience that some of the negative reviews I've read on here seem completely unjustified.    Considering we stayed during the middle of Ramadan a month in which the staff's patience may be tested to the limit we found every single member of staff to be nothing but friendly polite and helpful at all times. On arrival to our room late Saturday evening we found the room to be very hot and the rear sliding door to be faulty. Being too tired to make an issue of it we slept through and raised the issues with staff first thing in the morning. On returning to our room less than 3 hours later both issues had been fully resolved and we could not fault anything else throughout our whole stay.    The room along with the whole of the hotel had a real luxurious feel about it.    We saw no issues with the breakfast as others had mentioned. We found the selection to be more than sufficient to give a bit of variety each day. Breakfast included everything you would really expect from a buffet from cereal fresh fruit pastries and a small selection of cooked food. The added bonus was the option of an omellete cooked to order each morning. We saw none of the issues with flies as previously reported. Can't seem to remember one fly at breakfast during our whole stay.    My one issue would have to be with the price of food/drink. We only ate one night at the hotel due to the price. There was no issue with the quality of the meal as we both very enjoyed it. However we didn't feel it was quite as good as the ¬£75 (roughly) bill for a 2 course dinner for 2 and a bottle of cheap wine would suggest.    Overall I would certainly recommend this hotel if they were to offer the half price deal we were able to find but would not be quick to book at the full price.,Date of stay: August 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bridgwater, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tom_R353535353535353
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Wendy T wrote a review Aug 2011,40,serene retreat,My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our weeks stay at this hotel. The pool reception area restaurant and accomodation were all immaculate. It was a welcome retreat from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech. We found all staff from reception to spa and also the taxi driver to be both polite and friendly and always accomodating. The only downside if I have to think of one was the fact that during our stay a family arrived with two children (approx 8/9 years of age) which although well mannered their screams and yelps around the pool did ruin the tranquil atmosphere enjoyed at all other times. As a parent of a 10 and 13 year old I would definately not recommend this hotel for children but it is perfect if you are looking for a serene retreat!,Date of stay: August 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wendyt155
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,chocolatemonkeybear wrote a review Aug 2011,50,"Fabulous, luxurious and contemporary",We have just returned from a most relaxing and enjoyable stay at the Siryane.    The overall vibe is relaxed luxury meets contemporary minimalist architecture. The main building has a luxurious red and silver theme from the blissfully cool reception to the stunning ceiling in the bar.    The accommodation is wonderful. I particularly recommend one of the little cottage rooms with private garden - lovely. Upon returning to our room each evening we found our bed decorated with rose petals - different ones each day - from the hotel garden.    The staff are particularly attentive. Nothing was too much trouble. Upon arrival we were greeted with local mint tea and scrumptious home made Moroccan pastries and lots of water and nibbles in the room - a real relief after a long flight.    The shuttle into the Medina is a great idea and a fantastic freebie!

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,classyluxury wrote a review Aug 2011,30,This place has delusions of grandeur!,"We stayed for 1 week as part of the Groupon deal. When we arrived the staff were dealing with others who had arrived before us so we didn't mind waiting but when they had finished with them we had to approach them - they did not come to us. We were taken on a short tour of the hotel and it looks lovely as you can see from the pictures however it was definitely a case of style over substance. We were in room 110 which had a garden area. The first 2 nights we couldn't sleep for the heat as there was only 1 bulky ugly air con unit for the whole room and it wasn't very effective. The remote for the unit stopped working so someone came to fix it and cleaned the unit while they were there and it worked much better after that. We then realised we couldn't sleep the rest of the time because the bed was so uncomfortable! It was rock hard and uneven. I normally like a hard bed but that was ridiculous! We complained to Reception and nothing was done. I bumped into the manager and mentioned about the bed he was incredibly defensive and said I was the only person ever to have complained about this. I said that was how it felt to us maybe he should try it for himself and he reluctantly agreed to put a quilt on top of the mattress. As you can imagine it made no difference at all so we really did not have a relaxing holiday. The room looked nice and it was good there was a decent TV and a DVD player but it was a little irritating that there was only 1 English-speaking channel and that was BBC News 24 which got boring. We'd taken some DVDs of our own knowing that thank goodness but the DVD player would throw a hissy fit and stop working every time we used it. I would recommend they invest in some sort of iPod dock to play music from as lots of 5* places have. The shower was OK the pressure was a little weak and it was annoying that there was nowhere to hang your wet trunks/bikinis to dry. Also the toilet paper was cheap and thin not what I'd have expected from a 5* hotel.    The spa looked beautiful but every time we went in the staff were asleep!! They barely spoke English and were really lethargic it felt like we were an inconvenience to them. We had a free hammam massage as part of our deal - what a waste of time! The girl gave us a pathetic scrub with some stuff left us in a steam room for ages then came back and scrubbed us a bit more made us have a shower then left us again! When we were getting undressed for the hammam they told us to put one of the dressing-gowns on in the changing room. My boyfriend went to pick it up and noticed it had a massive skid-mark in it! Gross! We told the girl and all she did was took it away and brought another. Made us question how clean things were. I had an oriental massage too it was OK apart from the fact the girl didn't ask if I had any areas to avoid/work on and whether the pressure was OK - she wasn't taking the hint when I was wriggling away from where she was pulverising me with her elbows and saying 'ow' - I ended up with bruises on my back!! Also she left me in the room alone for 10 mins before starting the massage and she suddenly remembered part-way through she should have put some relaxing music on and she also switched it off before I got dressed - so unprofessional.    The best thing about the place was the pool - it was cold when you first got in but you got used to it. There were plenty of sunbeds so you never had to worry about getting one and they were really comfy - much better than the beds! The pool boys were always helpful if you needed to move your umbrella.    We really felt that no one really cared whether we had a nice time or not. I phoned Room Service and asked for an iron I had to ring 3 times over half an hour before someone came. When she finally came all she had was the iron and no board! She mimed to me that I should iron on the bed - no way was I doing that!! I had to ring up again and she sent her back to take the clothes I needed ironing and they did them for me. Why not have irons and ironing boards in the rooms? As we were leaving the guy on Reception was cold and indifferent. He never asked if we had enjoyed our stay. He got annoyed because I asked for a separate confirmation to say we had paid our bill. Their billing system is confusing - if you happen to have 2 bills that were for the same amount on different days they are combined into one! Eh? Took us ages to check it over. As I was getting into the taxi to go to the airport a girl from Reception came chasing after me asking if I would write in their guest book - first of all I had very few pleasant comments to make and second trying to get into a taxi is not the right time to ask me to do that! What annoyed us the most was when we got back we received what was clearly a generic email saying ""Thank you for your gracious comments"" - how dare they be so arrogant to assume that every single guest signed the book and that they had only good things to say!    The staff in the restaurant were the most helpful and friendly in the whole place. They at least tried to smile but we never had any conversation with any of them. We enjoyed the food but it got incredibly boring - there was the Moroccan menu and the International menu to choose from. The manager will surely say there is plenty of choice but there isn't because as with any menu you wouldn't choose every single thing so ended up rotating between the same 2 or 3 things. The restaurant manager was working on our last night. We complained to him as the bed of shredded cabbage that our Moroccan pastries were presented on was green mouldy. He didn't even apologise he just took them away. Then my boyfriend complained that the packet of butter that came with his bread was smeared in mustard (it had clearly been given to someone else and was unused - no big deal about reusing it if it hadn't been opened but at least check it's not smeared in the remnants of their dinner!) again he just took it without apologising. When the bill came he had charged us for our starters so I said I was not prepared to pay for them so he huffed and puffed and came back with an amended bill. Then he gave us some Moroccan tea ""as a gift"" - we never asked for it and would have preferred if he'd have not charged us for our drinks or something as a ""gift""! We are far from cheapskates but the set menus were not good value and drinks were expensive (especially alcohol) and everything had a 10% service charge on. I struggled every day at lunch as there was not much to choose from and it was pretty dear.    The breakfast was exactly the same every day - it was fine but it would have been nice for them to change it up a bit.    Another irritating thing was the music - in itself it was fine not too loud or intrusive but they played the same CDs over and over and over again!! It really started to get on my nerves after a few days. Oh and the free wi-fi wasn't exactly high-speed.    It's a real shame - this place could be great they need to train the staff better get better quality mattresses change the menus every once in a while reduce the prices listen to their customers and get over themselves!",Date of stay: July 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,manchester,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/classyluxury

We were greeted by a lovely air conditioned car and driven to the hotel that is about 10 minutes drive away from the centre of Marrakech.    Upon arrival you are greeted by the very firendly hotel reception staff and whilst filling in your registration paperwork you are presented with a lovely pot of Moroccan mint tea and homemade biscuits. A lovely touch after just arriving on a flight from London.    The rooms are of an excellent standard with a very modern design and decor. As it was my wife's 30th birthday the owner (Mehdi) had given us a complimentary upgrade to a garden suite that had direct access to the pool and a private garden and sun loungers.    The hotel provides a free shuttle service into the centre of Marrakech at set times throughout the day and the evening. It's a lovely idea that allows you to explore Marrakech during the day but then allows you to return to the peace and tranquility of Sirayane at night.    The staff could not do enough for you. They will reserve local restaurants and attractions for you and can even provide a private driver for that extra special night. I think the food in the hotel was of a very high standard although wine and drinks can seem a little bit expensive.    Overall a superb hotel that provides a very intimate and personal service.

Our Superior Room was charming and the Italian shower a treat after a hard day by the pool!    Amidst the relative ""chaos"" of Marrakech the Siryane is a haven of tranquility but if you want to go in town for shopping/trips/dinner then the shuttle is your only option - as there is nothing in walking distance.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,NaughtyFourties wrote a review Aug 2011,30,Very average ....nothing special,After extensive research on the internet we decided to stay here after reading some great reviews about the hotel. However it is definitely not a 5 star......I was really disappointed as I had only wanted a 5 star hotel for my wedding anniversary this was advertised as one and turned out to be 3star. The hotel staff knew nothing about restaurants recommending where to go in Marrakech there were no leaflets at reception just a map of the town centre.  The food was again 3 star the evening menus limited no music no entertainment basically really really dull. Nor did I want to come to a party hotel but there was just no atmosphere !!  The pool was ok the rooms definitley not 5star the AC was barely there......what more can I say.....on the whole from all the reviews I've read the management seem to be very defensive ......they need to LISTEN to their customers who have spent good money on this hotel !!! And make some changes !!! For the same price (at this time of year) the 5 star Le Meridien The Sofitel and even La Sultana offer amazing luxury. We went to La Sultana and I felt I had been to heaven and back when I saw the place. We will definitely not be returning to Sirayane as I feel they are not being honest on their website and to customers  they just seem to want to make money from you via taxi fares and tours.  One other thing......the attitude of the spa staff.....although we never used it ....it just never appealed to us we used the showers there on our last day before we headed out to the airport. There was NO AC !!! In 40 degrees heat !!! And the attitude of the spa receptionist...... well what can I say ........it was 3 STAR !!!!!!!,Date of stay: July 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NaughtyFourties
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,TravellerLadyLondon wrote a review Aug 2011,20,Really disappointed,"I was really disappointed. I'd read a number of good reviews on tripadvisor before booking and had such high expectations but I was left sourly disappointed.    Good points: it has potential to be a great hotel if Management take heed of the comments on tripadvisor and implementing changes.  *The pool boys / maids / bar staff and gardeners were all excellent.  *The sunbeds were very comfortable with mattresses and pillows.  *Good sized bedrooms with good shower.  *Breakfast was ok but very samey with no fresh juice or decent coffee    Bad points:  *passive aggressive receptionists  *poor shuttle service (the driver was reckless quite arrogant and was always on the phone and refused to turn the air con on)  *the hotel is simply too far out (20 minutes minimum to the medina and if you dont take one of the shuttles you have to pay 40 Euro's return to the medina)  * the information officer was less than useless (and I quote ‚Äúthere are no good Moroccan restaurants open in Marrakesh at this time of year‚Äù)  *the food was not very good and choice was limited  *I was forced to sign the leaving book as part of my check out  *in 40 degree heat the air con only goes down to 17 degrees - so our room was never cool enough  *the spa was one of the worst spa experiences I have had.    Please note: in our experience the management of this hotel are arrogant and passive aggressive. They make you feel like they are doing you a favour and on the occasions we have complained or tried to complain we are met with hostility. In essence they cannot deal with constructive criticism (as may be apparent by the hotel owner's responses to posts made on this website).    *TripAdvisor wine voucher  As you will see on the tripadvisor page there is a complimentary wine voucher. As required by the small print we presented this to the receptionist at check in. A little later another dark haired lady in reception told us that the offer is only valid if you BOOK VIA TRIPADVISOR. We explained that we had discovered the hotel via the tripadvisor website and had booked through expedia. The lady smiled and said that my account of event was impossible but told us to keep the wine as a ""gift"" from the hotel. (FYI the wine like the receptionists attitude was poor).    *Room  Good sized room. Good bed. Good shower. Nice d√©cor. The maids made cute patterns with flowers and towels twice a day.    Limited toiletries. Limited cheap toilet paper. No toothpaste or toothbrush. No free bottled water. The welcome book states that the tap water is safe to drink and that if guests want bottled water they can buy if for 25 dirhams with a 10% service charge (even if help yourself to the contents of your mini bar)    *Location  Too far out. It is a minimum of 20 mins to the medina. It once took over 30 minutes due to traffic.    *Shuttle service  The hotel offers 6 shuttle services a day. This is not enough considering how far the hotel is from any shops / amenities. The times are rubbish. Plus the latest time you can return to the hotel is 10.45pm. On holiday? On a weekend? Ridiculous! You can take a private taxi but it will cost you 20 euros (one way). Plus if you like we did make friends with other hotel guests and try to share the cost of a taxi and go out as a group ‚Äì they charge 30 Euros ‚Äì an increase of 50%!!    The driver: he reckless and was always talking on his mobile phone or shouting out of the window to friends. He would never put the air con on and turned up the radio to high volume to drown out the conversation of hotel guests. Plus if you opened your window he would use his control panel to close it.    *Food: breakfast  Nice pastries but all in all very limited in terms of choice. It was the same food EVERY day rarely any fruit lots of flies (although on the last 2 days of our stay they closed the door and this improved things) terrible coffee FAKE orange juice carefully disguised as fresh orange juice ‚Äì how you might ask? Well apparently they don‚Äôt have enough space to buy in fresh oranges for all the guests (??) so they use orange juice drink from a carton (i.e. chemicals) and add one or two fresh oranges for effect. We have ordered fresh orange juice from the hotel bar. It was 30 Dirhams ‚Äì so just under ¬£3 ‚Äì so they obviously have it if you want to pay extra for it.    *Food: lunch and dinner  Limited menus that are massively overpriced.    *Gym  We went to the gym twice. It is very small (cross trainer bike rower treadmill and a small multi gym) and on both occasions neither the cross trainer bike rower nor treadmill worked. We asked the Spa staff for assistance and they disappeared. After 10 minutes we tried to find them and couldn‚Äôt. We left the gym. We returned the next day and the gym was in the same state.    *The Library / Living Room  It has 5 books.    *WiFi  Limited. Dial up speed and for two days we had no internet. We called reception 3 times to report this and each time we were told that they did not realize this was an issue. Needless to say nothing was done.    *TV  One English Channel: BBC world news.",Date of stay: July 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellerLadyLondon
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,andycharleton wrote a review Aug 2011,50,A perfectly peaceful and relaxing oasis just 20 minutes away from the hustle of Marrakech centre!,Myself and my boyfriend booked to stay for 3 nights in a Junior Suite room with our own private pool and garden area. It surpassed our expectations and due to the extreme heat we were never far from the pool or much needed air con of the room! Presentation of the room when we arrived was a lovely touch with petals around the bed and in the filled bath. This attention to detail continued throughout our stay with daily cleaning of the room great service from the bar restaurant and reception staff and good food and drink consumed throughout our stay. We also enjoyed massages in the spa which were very relaxing and worthwhile. We relaxed the moment we arrived at this hotel and this continued throughout our stay. We would definitely recommend it to friends/family who want a peaceful and relaxing hotel with top notch service outside of the chaos of Marrakech centre which can be easily explored also!,Date of stay: July 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Maidenhead, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andycharleton
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,AlexSuzanne wrote a review Jul 2011,50,"Great staff, beautiful hotel, perfectly peaceful",We went as a couple for our anniversary and had a lovely five days. We are mid twenties and the hotel would especially be great for couples of all ages.    The airport transfer was quick and easy and Sirayane had arranged a private taxi for us (with a great driver!).    We were worried it might be located annoyingly far from the city/medina but the free hotel shuttle taxi was perfect for that and made the Sirayane amazingly peaceful 15mins drive away from the craziness of the city.    The room was also great. My OCD girlfriend was happy with the cleanliness! Huge bed really comfy and a decent sized room with everything we needed.    Private entrance onto pool was brilliant and there were always poolside beds (which were awesome) available for everyone. The pool attendant would personally come and adjust how much shade as often as we wanted.    We didn't go all the way to Morocco to eat in the hotel every night but the few nights we did it was good. Lunch was great and breakfast was fine (the few times we could be bothered to get up). Menu was decent (cool mixture of Moroccan and international options) and was super convenient. The owner of the hotel greeted us every single lunchtime for a non-imposing chat about our plans and how we're enjoying our stay... I thought a really nice extra touch.    I had been worried that my sexy blonde petite girlfriend(!) might feel a bit unsafe but we constantly felt really safe in the room / hotel / grounds.    In general a brilliant stay a great set of staff (so friendly) and a smart service.

The tables were left dirty far longer than should have been & twice we were seated at a dirty table the staff seemed very reluctant to clean it & reacted like it was ok! Travel lodge breakfast is much better!    Don't get me wrong it certainly isn't all bad the staff need customer service training to 5* luxury standards especially as this is what it claims to be. The spa is lovely & the pool area & beds were very clean & luxurious (although no heated pool - it was freezing)    I would certainly advise a garden room so you can sunbathe in your garden it had lovely comfy sun loungers!

The staff were very helpful and always smiley the food was brilliant the breakfast buffet catered for all tastes the pool was lovely and calm and the beds by the pool are more like double beds than sun loungers. The rooms were all nicely designed and spacious proper showers (not an add on to a bath ) and the tap water in the rooms was ok to drink.  Free wireless internet throughout and free computer in lounge. Tennis court...  Even if the hotel was 15minutes drive away from Marrakech town centre this was not a problem as the shuttle service is perfect and it's a bonus to come back to a calm hotel after an evening out in the souks. We recommend eating out in the city at least once as it's quite an experience - and we didnt get ill...!  The staff gave us good advice on where to go and what prices were reasonable.  All in all a great holiday we really recommend it for a peacful and sunny break with city excitement 15minutes away.,Date of stay: July 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amz37
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Dicewoman wrote a review Jul 2011,30,Lovely Hotel But Completely Let Down By Food,Myself and my husband stayed at the Sirayane.    Our room was lovely and could not fault the room serivce it was cleaned daily and there was also a lady who came round each evening to turn down the bed.    The pool was nice though have seen better and the photos on the website do it justice.    our main gripe however is the food.  We ate on 2 occasions and were extremeley disapointed on both occasions. The dinner menu is a choice of 2 set menus one costing approx ¬£25 the other ¬£35 per person. We opted for the ¬£25 on the first evening and for this I got one chicken drumstick floating in some lemon sauce with a couple of olives (No rice cous-cous or side order is included or offerred) then for dessert an orange and cinnamon salad that was a small glass of orange juice with a couple of bits of orange floating in it with a sprinkle of cinnamon on top.  On our last night we thought we would treat ourselves to the ¬£35 meal this was no better the starter was fine but the main course of steak and mash consisted of a tiny piece of steak and some bizzarre lump of runny mash with a tomato and herb smiley face thing in it which resembled something my 4 year old niece would make with her food. For dessert we both had a melt in the middle chocolate pudding this had exploded during cooking and had been covered by some bizarre red sauce to cover this up and was not cooked properly which meant there was raw egg in the centre.    The breakfast was varied and there was a lot of choice if you like sweet things however every morning it was crawling with flies and honey bees the only things that were covered were the warm things all the cakes fruit salad and pastries were swarming with flies which was extremely off putting. My husband has a cast iron stomach normally and never has any problems wherever we have travelled before but he was unwell with symptoms that could definately be associated with eating something dodgy.    The problem is because the hotel is so far out of town unless you are able to book a space on the shuttle bus then there is nowhere else to eat within walking distance most evenings we resorted to eating crisps in our room which is a real shame as one of my favourite parts of holidays is eating out..    The positives of the hotel are the rooms service (though everything is subject to 10% service charge including when you serve yoursel from the mini bar!) the spa is nice as is the private garden attached to all the rooms.    The food let us down so much though that we could not possibly reccomend the hotel. We have stayed in various places of all standards before and I have to say that some of the places we have stayed at described as budget have been preferable to herer even though it describes itself as luxury    If the hotel was to sort out the food both from a content and hygiene perspective I would be writing a very different review and we would be happy to return but as it is this would stop us from visiting again,Date of stay: June 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Barnstaple, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dicewoman
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,claireybel54 wrote a review Jun 2011,50,A tranquil oasis,I cannot recommend the sirayane highly enough. My sister and I stayed for 4 nights on May and had a fantastic time. The service was impeccable from the moment we stepped through the amazing oversized reception door. Mint tea and pastries were served whilst we undertook the arduous task of completing the paperwork. The hotel and rooms are stunning - we were fortunate to have our own garden over looking the pool. The spa was amazing although I have to say out of all the staff the spa staff are the least personable but this was probably only noticeable because the rest of the staff from the bar to the restaurant and the pool were so attentive and friendly. The hotel is about 10-15 mins from the centre but we never had a problem booking one of the free buses and it was actually a relief to retreat away from the mayhem of Marrakech at the end of the day. I was told that Medhi and his family are opening another hotel in the area next yr and will definitely be back to check that one out but if you are planning a trip before then either with girl friends or a partner I would highly recommend the Sirayane.,Date of stay: May 2011,,"Lymington, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claireybel54
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Ysmithy16 wrote a review Jun 2011,50,Fantastic hotel absolute luxury,Just back from a week stay in a Superior suite and loved it. Collected from the airport by the hotel driver we were at the hotel within 8mins. A beautiful room with separate walkin shower separate WC and vanity area very comfortable king size bed with high quality bed linen. When your ready to go out to the pool you just go out the patio doors across your own private garden and choose your sunbed. Oooh the sunbeds (double mattresses with pillows the most comfy I have ever used) you don't even need to place your towel the pool staff are there before you get a chance. The restaurant is first class with both the moroccan and european menus offering excellent choice The staff looked after us very well in particular the Head waiter Anas. The owner Medhi really cares about his guests he stepped in to help me when I developed prickly heat on the last couple of days. I asked reception if they could advise me where to get some medication or a pharmacy. While we were having dinner Medhi called a doctor for advice and sent his driver to collect a cream for me (and would not take any money). What customer service! I would definately go back. Many thanks to Medhi and all his staff for a very enjoyable stay.,Date of stay: June 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ysmithy16

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,AmandaMolloy wrote a review Jun 2011,50,Completely chilled out and will definitely return one day,We stayed at the Sirayane from 22nd May for a week. The staff were absolutely spot on! Their attention to detail meant that we didn't have to lift a finger for a week particularly the restaurant team. We would have breakfast and lunch every day at the hotel with a bottle of wine which the staff got to know by the end of the week. Our room was 108 which was over the fitness area and spa so we had a lovely spa aroma as we walked out of our room every day. The housekeeping team did a wonderful job every day leaving a different layout of fresh petals around the room. The food was by far nicer at the hotel than anything else that I had tried in the town. I would definitely recommend the scallops followed by the Fillet Mignon from the International menu one evening. It was perfect! From the moment we arrived at the hotel we were looked after and felt very welcome. The bar staff were also extremely welcoming and welcomed you with a smile when you walk in there. Not many people mention about the Pool Boys. They do a great job of ensuring there are plenty of towels available around the pool. It is keep clean and tidy and then actually move the parasols around during the day so you dont even have to lift a finger to adjust your shade.

The staff were always helpful friendly and polite and nothing was too much trouble including booking a hotel in the city for dinner for us one night.  We spent some time by the pool and some exploring the beautiful city the free shuttle- which could be more frequent But was free - meant you were staying away from the crazy hussle and bussle of the city life!

The staff were so helpful and nothing seemed to be a bother. Ask and it is done! We used the courtesy service from the hotel to the town and found it very useful and very quick given the distance from the town (approx 15 minutes) - a bonus at night for the tranquility.  We also used the same company for excursions to Essaouira and the Ourika Valley and our driver was so informative and helpful. We had to refresh our knowledge of the French language to make the most of these outings with all the knowledge that the driver had to impart but that was all part of the holiday - why do we expect everyone to speak English? I really enjoyed revisiting somethingI learned many years ago.  The bar/restaurant staff were lovely and we even cooked our own vegetable tagine in the kitchen (thanks for the recipes).  I would recommend this hotel as it is an oasis in the desert (and you can walk around it to explore the wildlife - there are many birds if you know what your are looking for as my husband does- and several different plant species) and you can relax if you choose to away from the mayhem that is Marrakech!

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,K4gold wrote a review May 2011,50,Fantastic new hotel With beautiful rooms,Myself and my mum visited the sirayane by chance as it was offered as a groupon deal. The hotel is brand new and the staff are fantastic. We stayed in one of the small villas just off the pool which has it's own garden. The hotel is not in the centre of Marrakech however the hotel does put on a courtesy bus to and from the hotel into the centre of town. The staff are more than helpful and keen to accommodate every guest even providing us with an iPad charger as we had forgot ours. The hotel does offer free wifi which is another great thing. It would be an understatement to say the the hotel is off the beaten track the road leading to the hotel is a dirt road and there is no way that you can walk anywhere. The restaurant at the hotel offers 2 menus local and international and each dish is delicious and cooked to perfection. However as there is no other places to eat around the hotel the menu can get quite monotonous. The lamb tajine is delicious though. The spa offers a range of treatments including a hammam which was great. It is really a hotel for couples. The rooms are stylish and spotless and there is a turn down service every night. The pool area is decorated with the most comfortable sun beds that I have ever used and there is a wee man who will lay out a towel for you and put up an umbrella if you get too hot.

I cannot complement the staff enough on their excellent service levels - from the process at check-in through to the service around the pool.  The hotel is located around 10mins drive from the Medina however the shuttle service runs frequently and allows you to manage your own balance of the hustle & bustle of Marrakech with the serene environment of the hotel. The d√©cor of the main hotel and suites are all very tasteful and help to create a relaxing environment they are well complemented by the pool area (the heated pool being really welcome in the cooler March climate).

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Helz16_11 wrote a review Mar 2011,40,Oasis amid the chaos,Very plush hotel away from the chaos of the Medina.  The quality of the food is good (¬£37 for 3 course international meal ¬£27 for Moroccan meal) and the choice at breakfast is excellent and is included in the price of the room .  Alcoholic drinks are expensive but generous!!  Choice of room service is limited but again good quality.    I visited this hotel with my boyfriend using the 'Group on' voucher in March 11 therefore we didn't pay full price and to be honest it would have been out of our price range at full price. But if you can afford it it's a lovely hotel that has full spa facilities.    The rooms are lovely and beautifully cleaned daily we had a superior room with our own private garden which lead to the pool. The bed was huge and comfortable the shower was fab (no bath though) and the general look of the room is very stylish with beautifully folded towels everyday. You're provided with toweling robes slippers and a full set of towels for your stay. (They also ask that if you're happy to reuse towels to not place them on them out for cleaning)  There is a tennis court (beach tennis rackets only though!!!) and 2 outdoor swimming pools one of which is heated in winter. The hotel is within its own walls so that it is isolated and secure.    We went to the hotel after 3 nights in the Medina and used it as place to relax after the chaos of Marrakech town! If you're staying here to explore the town there is a free bus run by the hotel to the 'Big Square' every 2 hours (starting at 8.45 til 10.45 takes about 20minutes) which is convenient.  The only down side is that if you were hoping to explore places close to the hotel (within walking distance) there is nothing nearby as it is down a track away from the main road. Along the main road there are endless building sites for new hotels however you can't hear any of this at the hotel which is peaceful (apart from being under a flight path for the airport!)    The staff are very friendly and helpful and organised airport transfers for us and made reservations for us at restaurants if were eating outside the hotel.  You can book trips to the mountains and the coast with the hotel but they are more expensive than if you booked them with a Riad in the Medina or a tour company.    Overall its a lovely peaceful and well maintained hotel if you are looking for lots of the things to do at the hotel to keep you entertained you'll be disappointed but if all you want to do is relax in the sunshine then its perfect.,Date of stay: March 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Helz16_11
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,suwinter wrote a review Mar 2011,50,"Absolutely perfect, an oasis of calm and tranquility.",We had a peaceful enjoyable stay. The hotel staff were helpful and cheerfully dealt with our enquiries and requirements.  The shuttle bus to the Medina is regular - you need to book but arrival was always prompt. You need to remember that you can't always get an earlier shuttle back if you get a bit foor-sore or weary but the petite taxis are cheap and cheerful (just make sure that the driver puts the meter on!)  The hotel breakfast was excellent with a good choice of hot and cold food with omelettes freshly made to order - these were very tasty and quickly prepared.  Our room was lxurious and a good size; it was beautifully adorned each night with flower petals and towel scullptures. There is satellite TV in each room and a DVD player - DVDs can be borrowed via reception.  There is free open-access wifi throughout the hotel and a PC in one of the lounges that is free to use. Wifi speed is ok but not good enough to stream or to use eg skype video call but hey it still allows access to the outside world!  Reception staff were efficient and friendly; the owner was also in regular attendance and he was also friendly helpful and seemed to be genuinely interested in our opinions / views.  You need to be aware that the hotel is in the middle of nowhere so you can't just 'pop out'. If you don't go to the Medina on the shuttle (where there are loads of things going on and it's the gateway to Marrakech) then your options are more limited. We didn't eat luinch or dinner in the hotel - we were too busy sightseeing as we were only there for 3 nights - but fellow guests reported that dinner was excellent.  The pool was heated and inviting - even in March - and there was an attendant on duty all day. The pool beds are comfortable and towels are provided.  We used the spa facilities one day and had a hammam massage - I personally didn't reckon that too much. Ours was free so don't know if you get more for your money if you pay but on the experience that I had the basic hammam isn't worth it - being a bit of a rinse with warm water a quick rub with Eucalyptus oil a very brisk rub with a scrub mitt and a rinse down with warm water for about ¬£20. A plus is that robes disposable undies and towels are provided.  All in all I would strongly recommend this hotel. It was a peaceful retreat with a luxurious feel; a strong customer service ethic was in evidence and it really was an oasis.,Date of stay: March 2011,,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suwinter
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,billbrig wrote a review Feb 2011,50,Peaceful setting - Excellent staff,Peaceful relaxing boutique hotel with excellent. Possibly the hotel's greatest asset is its welcoming well-trained attentive courteous friendly staff. Located 15 minutes from the city centre the hotel provides a regular shuttle service into town so you can benefit from both the hustle and bustle of the city and the calm of the hotel's rural setting. Restaurant with good selection of both Moroccon and European food for all tastes. Lovely heated swimming pool and a wide range of reasonably-priced spa facilities. A number of excursions available direct from the hotel to the Atlas mountains coast and major tourist attractions. I would definitely recommend the hotel as a base for visiting the country and intend to return soon.,Date of stay: February 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Bretagne,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billbrig
Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Annadongela wrote a review Feb 2011,50,A real piece of heaven,Just returned from Sirayane yesterday and cannot praise it enough. Mehdi (the owner) has put a huge amount of thought into the design of this hotel which is beautiful throughout. He is often onhand to check everything is ok.    All the staff were exceptionally friendly and polite and went out of their way to ensure you had everything you needed.    The spa was excellent with well trained therapists who provided an excellent service and the sunbeds around the pool were exceptionally comfortable.    Breakfast is plentiful and the evening meals although pricey were excellent. Would highly recommend the chocolate fondant pudding - to die for!!    It's only downside is its location in being so far out of the Medina however this ensures an uninterrupted view of the Atlas Mountains and a perfectly restful night. There are several free shuttle buses today which ensure you can get into the Medina when you want to so it isn't really that much of a negative.    We travelled with our children aged 13 and 10. The pool kept them happy and when they needed to escape the heat there are DVDs at reception which you can watch in your own room.    The gym is basic but has enough equipment for a standard workout as well as a tennis court - all free to use.    Will definitely be returning to this hotel when we next come to Marrakech.,Date of stay: February 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Newton Stewart, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Annadongela

The room(a superior) was spaciousclean and had all you wanted except tea and coffee making stuff. We had a small scrubby garden are but the amazingly comfortable plungers and sofa combined with privacy made up for it - also it was very new and by now the grass and plants would have improved it no end. All the staff were welcoming   friendly and very obliging - for example we had a dud light bulb and could work the heating and there was a rapid response.    The pool area was clean and the heated part of the pool perfect for a dip. Poolside attention with towels etc was always there.    The restaurant was good with friendly service and very reasonable if a bit limited menu and great wine. The owner came round one evening and asked guests for comments. I mentioned lack of hot food and was offered a fresh omelette next morning when I walked in!    Front of house staff and regular hotel taxi into town were efficient and very friendly and responsive. The peace and quiet of this beautiful little hotel with a real view of the Atlas mountains mean we would return.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,excellencetaste wrote a review Feb 2011,50,One of the best stays-nothing less than perfect,"Beforehand we were unsure if staying outside the Medina was the best choice-it definately was. This is a lovely oas wonderful architecture lovely rooms great thought of details and we got our rooms cleaned every morning by the very friendly staff and every night they fixed the room again with roseleaves on the beadsheats..very sweet. Only critique is that the staff should have more ""quick-tips"" about restaurants etc in the Medina. Great and professional spaservice. Read an older review that implied that the foodhygein would be bad-I'm the most sentitive about this and I did not see a single flie on the breakfast. There were four staff on the buffet (which was great and since its a small hotel kept small and managable) and they filled up the food at all times and made sure it was tidy. They even had two staffs constantly around the pool to give you fresh towels-all I can say is that it is a very ambitious project. LOVE IT never wanted to leave.

We were fortunate we hand nice weather during our stay and were able to enjoy the pool and sunbathe. Breakfast had everything we wanted and it was so nice eating it outside enjoying the view of the Atlas Mountains. We didn't really eat at the medina or outside the hotel. They had traditional morrocan food(which was delicious). The owner was so pleasant and helpful.

We had the nicest time here the staff are excellent very attentive and remembered what you liked and pre-empted your needs. It was great being looked after so well without feeling imposed.The hotel's hammam is clean and well equipped we had a treatment included in our booking which is recommended.    There are regular shuttles going to the medina which is very convenient. I'd say if you are looking for a relaxing time away to stay outside the medina.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Z M wrote a review Feb 2011,50,"a great stay, in a beautiful hotel with extremely helpful staff - good times :)",I have to say I cant really fault this place - if I had to criticise then the location is around a 25min drive from the medina.. however this also means that its basically silent at night so you get a great nights sleep and the hotel runs a free shuttle to/from the medina for free at regular times during the day and night - first one in is around 9am and last one back is 10.45pm    The prices are a little steep for me personally but I managed to get in whilst there was an offer one and felt like i was getting more than my monies worth - this place sells itself on many    the rooms are fantastic very clean very large great showers very confortable beds (although this was two twins pushed together) and bathrooms and the decor around the whole place has a real feel of luxury to it. the rooms are cleaned to a very high standard every day. you have your own private balcony or courtyard with sunbeds if you want to relax away form the pool..  the b'fast is includedm and has so much choice - again all of the food is pretty good.. especially the pastries!    there are 2 pools - one heated and one not heated.. as we were there in winter i stayed in the heated pool which was a perfect temperature. again cleanliness of both was of a very high standard. and the sun beds around the pool are basically double beds with pillows and towels provided - the comfiest sunbeds ive ever been on :)    the food is good if you dont want to venture out at night otherwise the hotel will book a restaurant at your request - we asked them to do this for us once and when we arrived they had made sure we got the best table in the place! we didnt ask at all but they took it upon themselves to do this for us.    on the day of check out we were able to stay late and relax by the pool until they took us to the airport - they charge but its the same price as any other taxi that doesnt try to rip you off.    we also got to have a hammam as part of our package - very relaxing.. gents beware of the cotton panties.. when i saw them folded up in the packet i thought it was a shower cap! haha had a good laugh about it though    a great stay for 4 nighrts in a beautiful hotel with extremely helpful staff - good times :),Date of stay: February 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WhereNext82

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,yuie wrote a review Jan 2011,50,A hidden oasis outside the bustle of Marrakech,We just returned from travelling around Morocco and this hotel was by far the best one we've stayed in. It truly is a little piece of paradise.    The service was impeccable. There was always someone there to answer our questions or help us with anything that was needed. This occurred throughout the hotel including the spa restaurant and reception. They made our experience carefree as we knew there was always someone if we needed anything.    Our room overlooked the pool as well as had an amazing view of the atlas mountains. It was clean spacious modern.    The shuttle bus has set times to go into the medina. I think they've added a later shuttle as we returned on the last shuttle around 10pm. The driver was friendly and accommodating. We were worried about being held to a shuttle schedule but found that the times allowed enough time to explore the medina. As well we were able to change our return time by calling the hotel if we wanted to stay out longer. Also we actually found staying outside the medina more relaxing and tranquil and a great escape after hours in the city.    We used both the spa and fitness room. The gym had the basic equipment we needed and the spa offered a variety of services including the hamman which is a must when you're in Morocco!    Overall it was an amazing stay and we will have been recommending this hotel to all our friends and family who are interested in visiting Marrakech.

Rooms were cleaned daily to a high standard too. Breakfast was a buffet style with fresh fruit cereals traditional morrocan crepes baked pastries cakes and much more! Yes there were flies but this is Africa! We ate there most days for lunch too salads were always fresh and delicious.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,RedMarch wrote a review Dec 2010,30,Could not wait to leave,I have just returned from Sirayane Hotel after spending 5 days there with my Partner. The hotel itself is absolutely lovely and it is such a shame that is is let down by poor management and non-existent customer service.    When we first arrived we were offered mint tea and pastries by a rather surly young lady who was not at all friendly or informative. Unfortunately there was an insect on the pastries which rather spoiled the welcoming gesture but which paled into insignificance when I saw the dozens of flies crawling over the breakfast buffet on our first morning. I complained to the young lady on Reception (the same one who had greeted us on our arrival) and suggested that the doors be kept closed at breakfast and the food covered. She made some telephone calls but did not give me any feedback. I did not eat at the hotel again until our last day when we sat close to the breakfast buffet. The food was not covered the doors were open and again I watched the flies crawling over the exposed food. Having witnessed the standards of hygiene at Sirayane I only ate bananas and yoghurt on the two days I had breakfast there but the breakfast looked to be of very poor quality with lots of cake and uninspiring pastries.    One of my main reasons for choosing the hotel was the huge pool (29m) and leisure facilities. The pool however is split in two and only the small bottom part is heated. I therefore found the large part too cold to use and the smaller area was really too small to swim lengths satisfactorily. The gym was extremely basic and I was not inspired to use it at all and when I asked about the walking/jogging track which I had read about I was given a puzzled look and told that there isn't one.    The hotel's website clearly states that the hotel is 10 minutes from the main City area. It is actually 20 minutes away and while there is a free shuttle there and back the times are limited and the whole system disorganised. The Reception team keep a scruffy minibus timetable at the front desk and it is necessary to go there to check the shuttle times and book onto one. We used the shuttle on four days. On one day the timetable showed incorrect times as it had been printed out incorrectly and there was great confusion making the booking; on another the shuttle drove off without 2 of its passengers and had to return; on another there wasn't enough room for everyone.    I suggested to the same young lady that I had spoken to before that it would be helpful to guests to have a copy of the minibus timetable in guest rooms so that they could check times and call Reception to book onto a shuttle. She appeared most put out that the system was being criticised and after arguing for a few moments that my suggestion was not possible she acknowledged that it was a good idea. However that did not happen during our stay. We found it very restrictive having to depend on the limited shuttle service. Unless you are prepared to pay ‚Ç¨20 to come back in a taxi which we did on our last evening it is not possible to have a late evening in town which makes things difficult when most decent restaurants do not open until 7.30pm or 8.00pm for dinner. The shuttle bus did not appear to be air-conditioned. It became very hot most days and the driver's solution was to open the window. I was also a little nervous on the journey to and from town as the driver spent most of his time on his mobile telephone and on Monday of this week almost collided with a cyclist on his way into town.    I asked about the cost of the laundry service one day at Reception and was as usual given a blank look which was followed by the usual flurry of confusion by about three staff members before I was told that they did not have laundry prices at Reception. On another occasion I asked about tours upon which a booklet containing dirty scruffy-looking print-outs was produced. My partner asked to see this again a few nights later but Reception could not find it and said they would re-print it and bring it to him in the bar. They didn't. We ended up booking a tour with an external agency as there was simply no tourist information provided at the hotel. It was significantly cheaper in any event.    On a positive note our room was comfortable although there were some issues with sound-proofing and we had a pleasant hammam treatment at the spa. However all in all I found everything at the Sirayane a bit sloppy from the roughly-finished private garden outside our room to the doorman in stained clothing who was frequently to be found slouched against the main door smoking. There is no customer service and in fact I found the young lady who seems to lead the Reception team quite arrogant and completely lacking in any kind of customer-facing skills.    On our last evening we settled our account before retiring to bed. There was some confusion over the bill as we were being charged taxes which we had already paid as part of our package. This morning I handed back the keys to our room and was called back by the gentleman on the desk who appeared to be implying that I was leaving without paying. When I explained that I had paid the previous night he checked the computer appeared confused and then grunted that we could go. I was invited to sign the guest book but I declined saying that I had not had a good stay. Despite the fact that there were four people behind the reception desk listening not one person asked what the problem had been.    This hotel really could provide a lovely experience but it appears to be managed by people who have no customer-service skills and no interest in looking after their guests. It has been a long time since I have had such a poor hospitality experience and that from an establishment which holds itself out as 5*. For a new business it is quite bizarre that it seems to have no interest in constructive comments from its paying guests.,Date of stay: December 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RedMarch

Very attentive staff good breakfast and excellent Spa. Out of town location but several daily ""navettes"" (which are free) from the hotel to the centre of Maerrakech (Jamaa El Fnaa) make life easy. The owner was contantly present taking feedback from the guests. In the end we felt as if we were really at home. Large rooms and high ceilings give a feeling of spaciousness. Good pool for real swimmers. The small size of the hotel (in terms of rooms) and friendly nature of the staff make it a much more personal experience than many hotels we have stayed at.

Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,GDoek wrote a review Oct 2010,50,"You will step into a world of luxury, design and quietness",We‚Äôve stayed at this wonderful small hotel for 3 nights in a junior suite with a private pool. The hotel is brand new and opened its doors on the 1st of September 2010. It is always a bit tricky to book for a start-up hotel but the very reasonable introduction price and the good reviews convinced us. Although we experienced some little start-up problems (introduction prices leave some room for little error but you still have to convince the customer) our stay at the Sirayane hotel was very pleasant.    When driving towards the resort from the airport or the Medina (Marrakech‚Äôs old city ‚Äì 10 min) you pass by a lot of (unexplored) construction sites which unfortunately look a bit uninviting. However from the moment you will drive through the large gate of the hotel you will step into a complete other world of luxury design and quietness. The hotel is from a very nice trendy modern design (the pictures on www.sirayane.com speak for themselves) and the interior fits superb in the overall environment. The pool is centred in the complex and offers very nice cabana-style beds for two. Even though the main- and our private pool where a bit chilly the relaxing music and amazing view on the Atlas mountains (on a clear day) make the hotel a perfect place to escape from the somewhat hectic environment of Marrakech and the rush of daily life.    Our room was very specious and modern furnished. The finishing of the construction and materials used in the room are not always from a very high standard but this is more of a minor issue. The bed is very nice well working LCD-TV and DVD-player (the reception offers a large selection of movies) and a nice bathroom with whirlpool. The only lack of the bathroom is that there is no separate shower. The separated toilet is a big plus. Housekeeping was very well done and they have a nightly turn-down service (opening the bed clean up bathroom etc.).    Breakfast and lunch are fine and the diner we had once was also very tasteful. The hotel is perfect for relaxing at the pool (leave your kids at home) or in the spa (we did not try but it looks nice). When you would like to go into Marrakesh you can reserve the free shuttle (10 min drive). The last shuttle to the hotel leaves a bit early (21:00u) so I‚Äôve you would like to go into city for diner or drinks you have to get back by private transfer. You can take a taxi but they are often very crappy and do not know were the hotel is because it is new. It is better to let the hotel arrange your pick-up (‚Ç¨ 20-).    Overall the hotel is a very nice place to stay. Of course they have to work on some details - the concierge service (arranging trips restaurant reservations general information) for example - but I am sure they will. The general manager/owner is often on site and it is an incredible nice guy which will do all he can to give you a pleasant stay and to make the Sirayane hotel one of the top resorts of Marrakech. The resort has the potential for sure.,Date of stay: October 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GDoek
