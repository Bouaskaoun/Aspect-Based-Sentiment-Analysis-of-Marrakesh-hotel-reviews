L‚ÄôOliveraie de l‚ÄôAtlas,Mary Lois B wrote a review Dec 2022,50,Paradise,Myself and my daughter stayed for 4 days in this absolutely beautiful hotel. We wear lucky to be upgraded to a suite which was amazing. All the staff are so friendly and do everything possible to help for transfers to the center. The pools are lovely but it was too cold to swim in them. If you are looking for peace and quiet just to relax than this is the place to be.,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maryl0isb
L‚ÄôOliveraie de l‚ÄôAtlas,mark wrote a review Oct 2022,30,Ok for one night.,We used that place to stay in transit outside of Marrakech. Nice pool. Food choices were limited and the quality was ok not great. Rooms are a bit dated. It is in the middle of nowhere so a car is pretty much a must. Staff was not that helpful.

L‚ÄôOliveraie de l‚ÄôAtlas,Sunshine603367 wrote a review Jun 2022,50,"Relaxed, chilled, friendly unique hotel",Fabulous place; chilled family run vibe everyone welcoming and there to help with anything you could possibly need (particular mention to Abdou who organised some trips for us and answered lots of questions before and during our stay).    Lovely staff that couldn‚Äôt do enough to help. My daughter has celiac disease and the chef cooked her up non-menu gluten free items - really looked after us. Food was good Freshly made to order - we ate through the menu on the evening meals though so did run out of choice (but they will make things off the menu if you ask). Lunch menu is much bigger than the fixed 2 or 3 course evening menu. Breakfast is traditional Moroccan - fruit pancakes boiled eggs bread. Always plenty out (not a lot other than fruit for breakfast for a gluten free diet though).    Particular mention to Wadia who was very helpful and sweet (always making sure we had enough of everything).    Slightly random times for the free shuttle into the city only 09:30 and 10:30 in and 16:30 and 18:30 back - but we made the most of them for a few of the days we were there (all the drivers were very helpful and friendly). It‚Äôs about 20/30min drive into the city.    Grounds are absolutely beautiful they grow a lot of the vege / fruit that they use. Plenty of towels for the pool and we never had a problem getting a sun bed.    It has been custom built as a hotel but the individual buildings are built in Riad style and very authentic. We had a two bed room that was huge - so much room and a balcony that overlooked one of the three pools.    Our flights home got cancelled and we could only rebook three days later the hotel was fully booked out for an exclusive wedding so we couldn‚Äôt stay - but the owner (Nicolas) made a point of coming to discuss with us and offered his number in case we needed anything even when we moved to a different hotel. Absolute epitome of good service.    Overall a lovely stay and would recommend if you are looking for a peaceful tranquil relaxing haven away from the craziness of the city.,Date of stay: June 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sunshine603367
L‚ÄôOliveraie de l‚ÄôAtlas,NinaGriffo wrote a review Apr 2022,50,"BEAUTIFUL, FRIENDLY, A SLICE OF PARADISE OUTSIDE OF MARRAKECH",Hotel L‚ÄôOliveraie de l‚ÄôAtlas deserves all the praise it receives in its reviews. It‚Äôs a beautiful hotel with stunning gardens and manicured pool areas made all the more special by the owner Nicola who was the very definition of accommodating. Far from the sterile cookie cutter hotels you can find just about anywhere you travel this hotel had an warm family run feel that no doubt makes for plenty return custom.    We actually had to reschedule our holiday due to testing positive for covid the day before our original plans and Nicola happily moved our booking last minute with no hassle. He was happy to help with anything we had a query about - restaurant / bar recommendations excursions money etc. Nothing was too much.    The hotel runs 4 free shuttles per day (two to Marrakech in the morning at 9:30 or 10:30 and two returning at 16:30 or 6:30) which we made a lot of use of.    There plenty of lunch and dinner options at the hotel restaurant (around ¬£22 for 3 a course dinner). Breakfast selection wasn‚Äôt extensive but we weren‚Äôt there at the height of the season so expect there would be more choice when it‚Äôs busier.    We‚Äôd reccomend booking a trip to the Atlas Mountains through the hotel. This was an unforgettable trip that was made completely easy and tailored to us by our wonderful driver.    Overall we wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to reccomend Hotel L‚ÄôOliveraie de l‚ÄôAtlas to anybody weighing up options you certainly won‚Äôt be dissapointed.    Thank you Nicola and your team of super friendly staff.    Nina and Petra,Date of stay: March 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NinaGriffo
L‚ÄôOliveraie de l‚ÄôAtlas,Chandni B wrote a review Apr 2022,50,We loved it!,When we arrived Nicholas (the owner) said ‚ÄúMake yourself at home‚Äù and that's exactly what we did. If you want authentic Morrocan then this is the place; the rooms the delicious food and friendly service. What an excellent hotel this is! A couple of musts - Book yourself in for a hammam and massage one day order a lamb tagine and a bottle of red one night. Chill by the pool with a mojito or just a Morrocan whisky (mint tea) or head in on the free shuttle to the town and explore the Souks (20 mins away) Absolutely loved it - thanks to an amazing team of people making this a hotel to visit.,Date of stay: March 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Widnes, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/855chandnib

Close to the heart of Marrakesh the hotel provided the perfect base to experience the vibrancy of the city and unwind after.

L‚ÄôOliveraie de l‚ÄôAtlas,Oussama Jebbar wrote a review Jul 2021,30,A missing anniversary celebration,Well.. I chosen this hotel with my wife in order to celebrate my anniversary..  The check-in was exceptional the welcome of Nicolas was amazing especially when he accepted our early check-in by 8:00 AM ! We‚Äôve really appreciated it.. we also gladly appreciate our upgrade to a suite with a wonderful view !!  We contested by swimming in the swimming pool that it was so dirty and filthy ! Even the pool land was very dirty and full of moss !  The other thing that I didn‚Äôt appreciated was the totally ignorance of my 31th birthday !! Even though the receptionist was aware about it but no waaaw moment was happening !  Otherwise the F&B service was excellent ! Momo and Taoufik are made our happiness while enjoying our meals during our stay in the hotel !!,Date of stay: July 2021,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Marrakech, Morocco",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Oussama_OJ7
L‚ÄôOliveraie de l‚ÄôAtlas,Sharon M wrote a review Mar 2020,50,Fantastic trip with friends,Stayed here for 5 nights with friends to celebrate two birthdays. Lovely hotel in calm peaceful setting. Great for a mix of visiting the bustling city and chilling out by the pool in the beautiful gardens. Nicholas and staff were friendly and helpful.  Beautiful riads and great weather. Slightly further out of town than expected need to use taxis and hotel shuttle to get around; but that is what makes it so peaceful!

L‚ÄôOliveraie de l‚ÄôAtlas,NLGK wrote a review Mar 2020,50,Relaxed atmosphere and great service,Last week we had a great city trip to Marrakech. We stayed at L'Oliveraie de L'Atlas a riad style resort with all facilities you need. We stayed in a two bedroom apartment which was great for our family of four. The weather was excellent and we stayed at the pool each day for a couple of hours. Although it is a 20 minute drive from Marrakech city center this doesn't feel as a burden. Shuttle and taxi transport is convenient and very well managed by the staff. Just ask them what you need and they will arrange it with personal care for you.,Date of stay: February 2020,,The Netherlands,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NLGK
L‚ÄôOliveraie de l‚ÄôAtlas,Ben W wrote a review Feb 2020,50,Winter sun,We loved our stay here I stayed six nights with my wife and two very young children. It is so peaceful but you are only 25 mins from the centre of Marrakech. The shuttle buses are convenient and if you do want to return outside of the shuttle bus times the staff will organise a taxi for you. So you get the best of two worlds the bustle of Marrakech and the peaceful hotel gardens and views of the mountains. The gardens themselves are delightful and very well kept even in the off season. The rooms are in beautiful Riad style buildings that are again well maintained. We had a family apartment which was huge clean and comfy. The Breakfast buffet was varied enough for the six nights and although the dinner was a little limited for us veggies it was always freshly prepared and tasty. As it was January the pool wasn't really an option hot enough to sit in the sun but not for swimming - only a dip!  Our overriding memory will be the kindness of the staff. Nikolas Younes Abdou and all the team were faultless with their service and were always available to answer questions solve any issues and interact/entertain with our children. Thank you so much!  We will recommend to all of our friends and family.,Date of stay: January 2020,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BenW857

The place is surrounded by orchards..and has three pools..spacious suites...    Breakfast was delicious..authentic Moroccan...Didn't use the shuttle as we used a private driver for all our trips...    Very clean...Even all the floors were getting washed every morning..    Had a small misunderstanding about the local taxes and it got sorted immediately...    All in all a five star place with local touch and hospitality...

L‚ÄôOliveraie de l‚ÄôAtlas,Lucyfog wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Magical üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü,After a tough 2019 we decided we wanted to see the new year in away from home. We had been to Marrakesh before we had children but now we have a 14 and 10 year old in tow. We took a punt on this hotel which I booked purely on the basis of the reviews. What a gem this has turned out be for our family! From the booking correspondence to the airport transfer to our arrival nothing has ever been too much trouble for our host Nicholas and his wonderful team. The service is truly 5 star. We have been lucky enough to travel around the world and this hotel really does stand out for its charm service and ensuring your holiday exceeds your expectations. The food is all homemade on the premises grown on the land and this is the spirit that runs through the hotel. There is something to eat for everyone and the chef will always do something that takes your fancy if he can. The free hotel shuttle running x4 a day is an excellent touch. Taking the hassle and haggle out of getting taxis to and from the city. Anything you would like to do they will do it with a smile:excursions spataxisrestaurantsadvice and recommendations. There are 3 pools with plenty of loungers to relax on catch a tan reads book. Lounger or garden table service for lunch was wonderful. Books board games satellite TV for news (not that we used it) terraces for enjoying the peaceful location and stunning views.    This is a cool discrete hotel offering personal service and authentic charm in a wonderful city. Thank you to Nicholas and your team.

L‚ÄôOliveraie de l‚ÄôAtlas,Hope Athanasakos wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Best hotel in Marrakech!,This hotel is INCREDIBLE! I came here with a group of travelers on a group trip and this hotel went so far above and beyond to make sure our stay was great. They organized a large group dinner for us out in the garden so we could all sit at one table scheduled spa services for everyone at their sister hotel upgraded rooms arranged airport transfers and were all around so amazing. The food here is so delicious the rooms comfortable spacious and stunning the staff was so lovely and I would 100% stay here again.  This spot is the perfect oasis to come back to while visiting Marrakech. You can go into the city (on one of their free shuttles) and then come back and lay by the pool and catch a tan.  Thank you Nicolas and everyone else for making our stay so memorable and relaxing!!,Date of stay: October 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hopeath
L‚ÄôOliveraie de l‚ÄôAtlas,Metalfan247 wrote a review Sep 2019,50,Exceptional service and accommodating staff,Stayed for 5 nights with my wife and we both agree that this has been an absolute joy of a stay. From arrival to departure everyone we dealt with couldn't be more accommodating at making us feel welcome or arranging any requests we had.  Every meal had many choices of local cuisine to sample. The prices were very reasonable and well prepared too. Some  other reviews stated limited choices but theres easily over a dozen different mains to select from the dinner menu alone.  We booked one of the suites and found it extremely spacious. Our room had a king size bed (very comfortable) and plenty of storage for your clothes. The air conditioning was a nice oasis from the hot afternoons.  We took advantage of all the pools; with 3 to choose you can always escape to one if you prefer privacy while taking a dip or laying out.  My only critique would be that their isn't a small convent shop onsite in case you need extra toiletries snacks or sunscreen. We did enquire one day for some and the manager offered to go to the pharmacy to pick so up nice!  If you're looking for a quite relaxing escape when staying in Marrakesh I would highly recommend booking here!,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Metalfan247
L‚ÄôOliveraie de l‚ÄôAtlas,TiggyAtkinson wrote a review Sep 2019,40,Great sanctuary around 30mins from the city centre of Marrakech,This hotel has opened fairly recently and we found it a real joy to stay - particularly due to the owner Nicolai. He was very welcoming and so helpful with tips about  local restaurants to try taxis a shuttle service to and from the city centre. The hotel has a number of pools but it‚Äôs secret gem is the spa facilities - a Hammam is a must when staying. Highly recommended if you are looking for a tranquil retreat after the hustle and bustle of Marrakech‚Äôs souks.,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TiggyAtkinson
L‚ÄôOliveraie de l‚ÄôAtlas,Kblaber1 wrote a review Aug 2019,40,Very Relaxing Stay,This is a little Oasis about 20 minutes from the hustle and bustle of the old town and the Medina. Upon arrival we was greeted by a very pleasant gentleman who checked us in. I would definitely book the taxi transfer direct with the hotel on arrival as far cheaper than the taxi's. We were very early however our room was ready which was fantastic so we got changed and headed straight to one of the pools. That evening we ate at the hotel - can highly recommend the Pastilla for a starter and the lamb grille was my favourite. The next day we decided to use the FREE shuttle service into the Medina this was booked at the hotel 2 drop offs per day and 2 collections. Nothing was ever too much trouble at the hotel it is very relaxed. On comparison the hotel is not overly priced to restaurants in the medina which is a bonus. Also trips organised by the hotel are not overly priced as we found out the hard way. All in all a fab stay. Maybe learn French also have cash!,Date of stay: August 2019,,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kblaber1

L‚ÄôOliveraie de l‚ÄôAtlas,Cat F wrote a review Jul 2019,50,Tranquility and top class grounds and service,Stayed in Room Zitoun 3 for 3 nights which comes highly recommended. It's a ground floor suite with a huge bedroom 2 bathrooms (toilet and sink + full bath toilet and sink) and a huge living space with a fridge for keeping drinks cool in the heat!  Room looks straight out onto one of the three pools and we had it to ourselves for 2 days straight! The birdsong each morning is magical and this particular riad (there are 3 or 4 on the grounds) is the best we thought - stunning central courtyard with classy furniture fruit trees and lots of break out spaces for chilling in the heat of the day. Staff are very well trained and I was especially impressed with their knowledge and provision of gluten free despite forgetting to provide advanced warning. Pools are very thoroughly cleaned every morning and there's a generous offering for breakfast and good coffee on offer! Dinners are a bit limited with about 5 choices on the menu so we were glad to have a change after 2 nights but as the owner explained the food is seasonal so sometimes limited. The only thing I'd improve is the spa which I felt was a bit basic and not a very relaxing experience but if you're good to skip that this place gets a big thumbs up from me.,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/693catf
L‚ÄôOliveraie de l‚ÄôAtlas,Jamie J wrote a review Jul 2019,50,Perfect in so many ways,After 3 hot sweaty and manic days I a central M√©dina riad (Riad Tahar Oasis - awesome place) we headed out here for some much-needed R&R.    The view on arrival is impressive from the big secure gates to the long green driveway lined with date palms orange and pomegranate trees and more.    Our riad was incredible. Massive room looking onto a near deserted pool. Extensive and well kept grounds always many options to find a quiet breakout spot with nobody else in view.  Incredible bird life and birdsong every morning.    Tip: try and stay in Riad Zitoun there is a flock of gorgeous birds that make the courtyard their own every evening. It‚Äôs quite a sight.    Staff are awesome very well trained and can‚Äôt do enough to help.    The only downside: the food offering is slightly limited and perhaps a touch pricey (but not too bad). It‚Äôs all fresh local produce mostly grown on site - awesome - but the dinner menu in particular is a bit lacking in options.    We had 2 lunches and 2 dinners here every meal was decent quality. Lunch was reasonably priced dinner is a bit pricey at 200d for 2 courses with no option for just one course.  They also need to change their orange juice pricing. It says 30 d on the menu but they try and charge 60 d for a fresh juice. This is more than we pay in London for fruit they grow on site.    These very minor niggles aside our stay was excellent and we will be back.,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Auckland, New Zealand",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamiej1975
L‚ÄôOliveraie de l‚ÄôAtlas,Elettra S wrote a review May 2019,40,"Beautiful garden, quiet and relaxing place",I spent here 1 week and the location is stunning!!! The hotel is outside the city and takes approx 15 min by taxi so be aware of this before you book. The hotel is offering transport for free twice in the morning to  The cyber park (strategic position between the old city and the new) and twice in the afternoon to get back. I highly recommend to use this service because each time is 15‚Ç¨ just to reach the M√©dina. Be smart.  We had the suite and was incredibly nice and huge (2 bathrooms  large bed and big living room with sofa and tv).  The whole staff is super nice and fix every wish you may have.  Few things i would like to point out: the poor choice of food both breakfast and dinner that made a bit boring the gastronomic experience that i was wishing to have. The food was very nice and tastes were balanced and all.. but a bit boring after the 3rd day. Would be nice to have some day‚Äôs special.  The spa treatments didn‚Äôt meet my expectations at all.  The hotel is very clean and every day our room was shiny and tidy. Please consider that the garden of this property is very big and lovely taken care by the gardeners be aware that you may find some small insects there and then on the outside surfaces and sometimes some may be try to get in your room. This is part of the beauty of being in a corner of heaven.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/244elettras
L‚ÄôOliveraie de l‚ÄôAtlas,Evi S wrote a review May 2019,20,Bad communication,It was all perfect until we received the bill. My mom couldn‚Äôt eat much because she was sick so we shared the starter and the main dish but we both had dessert. So for the starter main dish and the dessert you pay 250 dirham. So we had that + a dessert (two scoops icecream). So apparently we paid every night for that 400 dirham which means that you pay 150 dirham for 2 scoops of ice creams which is 15 euros????!!!! And they didnt tell us. The communication is very bad. We didnt know it was this expensive. Then we ordered jus d‚Äôorange which is on the card 30 dirham. Apparently we paid every time 60 dirham for it because it is fresh. And again they didnt explain. And I think its really strange that you pay with dinner 200 dirham for starter and main dish but 250 dirham for the starter main dish plus two scoops of ice cream. Ridiculous 5 euros for two scoops of ice cream.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Gendringen, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/947evis
