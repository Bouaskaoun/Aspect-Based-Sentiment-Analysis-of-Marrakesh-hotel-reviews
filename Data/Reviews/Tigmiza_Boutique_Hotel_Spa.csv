Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Claire C wrote a review Yesterday,50,"Amazing hotel, luxurious and baby-friendly",I don't usually write reviews but we just had the most amazing holiday at this hotel. We travelled with our young baby and everything was just perfect! We booked one of the rooms with a private pool which turned out to be a 1 bedroom villa which was perfect for putting our daughter to sleep in the evening and then being able to relax downstairs by the pool/on the patio with a glass of wine. For a holiday with a baby the hotel had all the practicalities of your own villa with space & a lovely cot set up but all the luxuries of a hotel such as having the room made up each day and being able to order room service each evening which was amazing! The staff were also brilliant - they had a baby seat in the shuttle bus which went into the medina every day and there were highchairs and heated pools so we could enjoy all the areas of the hotel with our daughter who loved swimming and having her breakfast in the beautiful sunny dining area. The staff even let us make up lunch from the breakfast buffet to take away for our daughter every day. The staff were so friendly & kind and made us feel so welcome. It's a beautiful hotel with amazing staff and one of the best places I've stayed in! Thank you to all the staff who made us feel so welcome - we will definitely be coming back.,Date of stay: March 2023,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V2553RCclairec
Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Esther wrote a review Jun 2022,50,So personal and attentive service towards guests.,This is a truly lovely boutique hotel. A tucked away hidden gem in Marrakech do you know what makes this place tick all the right boxes ? It has to be undoubtedly the people who work here.  The staff will do all they can to make your stay comfortable and they were so warm and caring we wish we could have stayed longer than a week.  We were on bed and breakfast only but had lunch and evening meals and a bottle of wine every day here and the total cost was not expensive.  Loved the English style pub bar with its sumptuous leather sofas the quirky trumpet and saxophone lamps. Great place to come to before dinner.  They even allowed me to play my play list of music whilst in that bar and I have to thank the lovely bar man for letting me do that. He is an absolute gentleman who really looked after us on those evenings and we appreciated the little pastry snacks to have with our drinks. Please remember us to him.

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Dainis K wrote a review Dec 2022,40,Place to come back!,Charming place little bit outside the Marrakech. Relaxing atmosphere nice 2 floor villas with a private pool and terraces. Very professional and helpful staff and great manager Amine. Breakfast serves both: local Moroccan and well as European style. As expected locally - plenty of pancakes. Nice lunch menu at the pool area.  As a things to be improved: reception area need some refreshment as well as main dinner restaurant (the same place as for the breakfast) has no dinner type ambiance and need little bit more luxury. Local dinner is not expensive but jammy however may be enough for one night. In 15 minutes you can go to other Marrakech restaurants in the city but reservation is strongly recommended (ask converge she is very helpful with great advises).,Date of stay: December 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/512dainisk

WIFI just was sketchy at best  So if you have a need to be connect for something important then consider doing this off site currently.    A note for the hotel perhaps consider reviewing the wifi signal ?

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Raj wrote a review Oct 2022,50,Best hotel I’ve ever stayed at!,Simply AMAZING.    Nice quiet location away from the madness of Medina. My room Noire & Or (Black & Gold) was out of this world. Absolutely beautiful. the hotel has 3 pools. All lovely and cold which is needed in the Moroccan heat.    The staff and service was exceptional everyone was very helpful and friendly. Full of suggestions for dinner and things to do. The decor is gorgeous throughout the hotel and the food was of a very high standard.    My only gripes would be that there is too much posh food on offer in the two evening restaurants available and not enough standard burger and chips type stuff. That being said the lamb tagine I had was one of the best things I’ve ever had in my life. The other thing would be the cocktails they are not of a very good standard I guess as the bartenders don’t drink they don’t taste them first and just following a recipe so they don’t taste like what you are expecting in the UK for sure. I stuck with beer in the end.    I’m 100% going to come back to stay here in the future and for longer. Such a relaxing place. Loved it!    Pro’s:  Great facilities  3 large pools  Large grass area for relaxing/Sport  Small “pub”  Food available 24/7  Great breakfast  Lovely dinner  Very quiet  Beautiful hotel  Very friendly staff    Con’s:  Dinner hasn’t got a lot of variety  The cocktails are of a pretty poor quality.    Tips:    You can change money at the hotel at a decent rate.    Bring cash as pretty much nowhere takes cards. (Hotel will let you settle by card at the end of your stay - no Amex)    A taxi to medina/back should not be more than 150DH (haggle before you get in one from medina the one from the hotel is a set price BUT they do 2 free shuttles a day 1000 and 1800)    Airport to hotel shouldn’t cost more then 300DH    When you get a taxi to the hotel make sure you tell them it’s in Bab Atlas. There are two Tigmiza hotels and the other one is in totally the wrong direction.    Enjoy yourself! It’s worth every penny.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/r_darkone
Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Polina B wrote a review Oct 2022,50,Paradise found,Imagine lush green banana trees slowly swaying above your head birds of paradise signing with joy and emerald blue water mirroring the sunlight. Imagine serenity warmth and sense of peace. This is Tigmiza. From the first moment you step inside the hotel you feel like this place is a paradise and nobody should ever know about it.    Tigmiza has luxurous interior exquisite architecture and attention to detail on every corner antique pieces beautifully handcrafted furniture. And you are so well cared for your every wish and thought is answered to. I was amazed by the level of hospitality here and it's seamless it's natural to them. You are standing outside the door to go to restaurant under the rain somebody will surely notice and come to you with an umbrella. Your child is sick they will call the doctor which will come under 2 hours and in 30 minutes you already have a medication delivered to your door by reception! Your trip/flight is cancelled due to strict covid restrictions they will give you a voucher for a year. (Thank you!)    Tigmiza staff is so kind polite and warm. They make you feel...happy. Happy to start another day with smiles and joy. From cleaning staff to reception to restaurant. I loved them all with my whole heart. Special thank you to Marouane. He's the kindest soul and made us feel like at home from day one.  The hotel is perfect for kids. There is a playarea cinema pool. My daughter was 2 and she loved it here every second. Watching Jungle Book in the private cinema.    The grounds are also mesmerizing. Pomegranates limes size of an orange olive trees everywhere. It's simply beautiful. We spent 8 days here and it wasn't nearly enough. Food is so delicious with plenty of choice for all tastes as there are 3 restaurants and room service 24/7. Rooms are stunning and cleaned very well. Shuttle to the centre is provided. Spa- Oh my. I cried from being too happy and relaxed.    I will recommend this place in a heartbeat to anybody but I probably won't because I want to keep this place a little secret hidden in my heart. :)    Thank you Tigmiza! <3 <3 <3    Polina Sari and Svetlana,Date of stay: September 2022,,"Helsinki, Finland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PolinaKantola
Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Rushvin wrote a review Sep 2022,40,Beautiful hotel,The hotel has very nice architecture and deco. Rooms were big and comfy. Pool is reasly nice food exquisite (3 restaurents - we recommend the moroccan one). The garden is very well maintained and if you want an area of peace this is the place to be. We really liked it after spending the days in the busy marakesh. It was slightly let down by cleanliness (rooms not fully cleaned at times and bathroom was often clogged) and no regular shuttle service to the city (taxi costs Eur 15 one way from hotel to city centre). That being said it was a very pleasant stay and we loved it!,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Luxembourg City, Luxembourg",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rushvin

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Lady gaga wrote a review Jul 2022,30,Great Villa But …,We stayed at the Tigmiza in a 2 bedroom villa this month.    The villa was breathtaking with nice decor a private pool and an Eden style garden with fruit trees and warbling birds The villa gets a 9/10 although it has no living room (just 2 bedrooms).    Some of the employees like Amin were outstanding.    On the other hand this is what was we did not like:  - the room service food was mediocre. As an example one of the club sandwiches had burnt bread;  - dinner was poor - food was not fresh (we returned 2 of 4 plates)  - breakfast was average with little selection  - on the last day we asked for a late check-out but this could not be accommodated which is fine ; we were told by Lamia that we would be given a courtesy room to wash up however we were given something that looked like a dirty and very small maid room which we found very poor taste to end an expensive stay. They should be forthright and tell people the truth (not a courtesy room by any stretch of the imagination)    Overall a 3 on 5,Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Montreal, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sberrada99

The reviews I read were all good and so was the location so I decided to book a pavillion.We arrived quite early in the morning so we were not expecting to check in tiller later.We were greeted by Amine the guest relations manager at the front desk.He advised us that the room will be ready shortly and were welcome to have some refreshments.We had barely finished our tea when Amine advised the room is ready and we could check in.We had a tour visiting the property and an eazy check in process with the gentle man salah.

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Nina C wrote a review Jun 2022,30,"Nice hotel, but too many negatives (and cats) that outweigh the good",We had a 2 bedroom Villa which we expected to have a separate living room but this wasn’t the case. the configuration of our Villa is the same as that of a 1 bedroom Villa (which does have a living room) but our Villa had the living room changed into a bedroom yet we were paying more for a less offering.    The hotel has a VERY limited menu option and even more limited restaurant selection. We travelled with 2 young children and the offering for kids is almost limited to just 3 things (and we stayed for 5 nights). Similarly to us adults we found ourselves eating the same things every day as there was only 1 limited menu for lunch and either 1 limited international menu or 1 Morrocon menu for dinner. The food wasn’t well cooked (meat at times very dry / over cooked; food lacking flavour/seasoning; cocktails not well mixed. The nearest food options were a 20min drive into the city.    The hotel also advertises itself as having a kids zone which they didn’t have so a bit disappointing to find out as these are some things that make a difference for family holidays when selecting accommodation.    Some of the gardens were not well manicured grass overgrown and needing attention.    We spent 3 days by the poolside and each day the glasses / bottles /cans left by us or other guests who has used the pool area would be there not having been cleared or cleaned. There was no operational bar or bar service at the pool which meant you had to always walk to the main pool to order refreshments. Food could not be consumed at this same pool - which is a bit of an inconvenience given the main area where you could eat your lunch was always busy with stray cats.    There were a lot of stray cats (I confirmed this by asking the reception if the cats belonged to the property to which he confirmed No) on the property (especially outdoor areas where you would eat) and in our Villa. We are both allergic to cats so having been forewarned of this would have been good and also something we would have considered in choosing this hotel for our stay.    Overall whilst a nice boutique hotel (with nice settings for taking photos) we wouldn’t come back  again as it’s not 5 star standard as we would expect (we are regular travellers who have experiences in 4 to 5 star facilities) . Would rate it overall at 3.5 stars,Date of stay: June 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y6768XAninac

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Salvador Quero wrote a review May 2022,50,Great getaway to the magic city of Essaouira,We took a one day trip to Essaouira and it was wonderful. Our driver Mounir was very patient and proffesional. Very smooth travel in the car ;)  The guide in Essaouira Hassan was great ! He explained all important facts and historic landmarks and everything in Spanish.  Before arriving to Essaouira we did three stops one coffe break one stop with the goats in the Argan fields and one last stop in a Argan oil women’s coperative. Argan oil is delicious and it is handmade and Bio (organic).  Once in Essaouira we started the tour in the port then we walked in the city: Kasbah medina and the mellah.  We did one stop in the silver jewelry factory. Good and fair prices.  At the end of the tour we had lunch in a chiringuito on the beach. Big warning no written menu so be sure to ask prices before ordering and they dont take cards…  The time in Essaouira was about 5 hours ! That’s great.  Then we came back to the hotel.

Always a bit daunting travelling with a small baby however the staff were exceptional. The room was equipped with a travel cot and a decent mattress (not always a given) a great baby bath. a bottle steriliser and fridge and kettle. We stayed in the pavilion rooms which was great and gave the space we needed. Everyday the staff offered to help us we were provided fresh puree each day for weaning and a our transfer came with a baby seat.

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,richard wrote a review Apr 2022,50,A hidden gem,We came across this hotel online and booked it based on photos of the garden swimming pools and rooms which looked charming and chic. It was even better when we arrived. We stayed at the duplex suite for 3 nights. The room was very spacious and decoration was nice but still felt cozy and had a special charm. The gardens were fantastic and the Moroccan restaurant was also very good. It is very relaxing environment and a perfect place to take some time off. Also a special shout out to Amine (the manger of the hotel) who was extra helpful and very pleasant to talk to. The hotel has a shuttle to the centre of Marrakech which is also very helpful. My girl friend left a gold and diamond bracelet when we left the hotel which Amine confirmed that it is found and we are arranging for it to be returned to us. We highly recommend Tigmiza.,Date of stay: April 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tour13111874260

After a 26hr flight and transit from South Africa the team at Tigmiza was friendly helpful and very very accommodating. English French and Arabic are the main languages I could make out the teams supports which makes your stay even that more amazing. The grounds and facilities are of the best I have had and recommend this hotel without any reservations.    P.S. A special thank you to my drivers (Taxi Talixo) that were so helpful that they extinguish any stereotype existing about Moroccan Taxi Drivers.

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,cathy e wrote a review Oct 2021,50,Great hotel,My daughter and I stayed 6 nights at the hotel. It was fabulous from start to finish. The hotel is lovely very peaceful and tranquil. The pools were lovely and the grounds very attractive. We stayed in the Art Deco suite which was really cool. Very comfortable and good location on the first floor by the Riad pool. The pool bar is great. It serves drinks and food (a little limited on the choice of food but perfectly adequate and good quality). We ate in the hotel 2 nights food was good. Breakfast was plentiful and good choice.  The hotel is very clean and all the staff were really friendly helpful and nothing was too much trouble. The reception/concierge was able to reserve restaurants in the Medina for us which was a real bonus. The shuttle bus is great and very useful. It returned a little early (8pm) so we got a taxi back to the hotel at night - easy to get taxis and cost 150 dh  Would definately recommend this hotel as it is 15 min ride out of the Medina which is so nice as its a great escape from the busy central area.  Weather was perfect - very warm so it was nice to cool off in the pool (whilst we were there the pools werent heated).,Date of stay: October 2021,,"Fleet, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cathye812
Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Lucy Tebay wrote a review Sep 2021,50,Incredible hotel with excellent service,"We arrived at Tigmiza on a Saturday evening and were greeted with a very warm welcome followed by delicious Moroccan mint tea and nibbles. The hotel organised an airport shuttle for us for 30 euros. We were then shown to our room (The pavillions) and led through the gorgeous green hotel grounds.    The reception staff are lovely and very helpful - I also can't say enough about how wonderful and accommodating the rest of the hotel staff are. The bar and restaurant staff are friendly and attentive the cleaners are sweet and thorough and overall we felt very well looked after. They also knock to change your towels every evening which we apprecaited!  We booked the ""Roses"" Pavillion which was a lovely large room (with a living room terrace and separate toilet). The decor was a bit bright and dated but the room is still gorgeous and a decent comfortable size. The bed is very comfortable (best sleep I've had in ages!) and it was nice to sit out on our own private terrace in the evenings.    We stayed at Tigmiza for one week and never wanted to leave - It is such a relaxing place and much less hectic than staying in the Medina.  The 3 pools are all different but equally beautiful (internal Riad style pool large external pool with pool bar and a more secluded rock pool style pool with small children's / paddle pool to the side (also with a pool bar although this one was not manned) - Safe to say the grounds of the property are huge and very well kept.    The hotel itself is stunning - It has a classy Moroccan vibe that isn't too over the top and there are lots of cosy seating areas. The seating area overlooking the Riad pool was our favourite we had a drink there most evenings and watched the birds settling down for the evening in the banana trees over the pool. There is an English themed bar just off Reception which does excellent cocktails and drinks before dinner. One gentleman (I wish I caught his name) made the best Pina Colada we have ever had and we subsequently had one every evening! We also sat in their Moroccan style tea room a few times to rest and have some delicious tea.    The hotel has two restaurants - one international and one Moroccan. They are both lovely but the Moroccan restaurant was very quiet and somewhat soulless in the evening. The food is excellent though so I would recommend.  However we preferred to eat in the main restaurant as it typically had more atmosphere. You unfortunately do not get a choice as to where they sit you each evening. The upside is that you can order food from both restaurants regardless of which is open.    Whilst we had a very enjoyable stay and would likely return there were a few downsides:  1) The free shuttle to and from the Medina as stated on Booking.com and the hotel website is no longer running due to Covid. We therefore had to fork out quite a bit of extra cash for taxis and shuttles. I wish we had known this in advance as the hotel is roughly 20-25 minutes outside of the Medina and a taxi (each way) cost us roughly 100 dirham 150 in the evenings. This was a major disappointment.    2) The rooms and pool bar are quite outdated and could use some renovations. The room seemed a bit tired and shabby (shower caddy was falling off the wall and paint peeling off the walls) the pool bar is also a bright green colour and wasn't very in line with the rest of the hotel decor...    3) The prices at the hotel are somewhat extortionate - similar to what you would see in a 5 star hotel in Europe! We booked Marrakech thinking it would be a cheaper getaway but it was very expensive. Each cocktail was around £10 each meal was around £80. Breakfast is free but lunches and dinners there cost us a lot    4) The spa staff speak no English only French and Arabic so this made it difficult for us to communicate with them in broken French. The spa prices are also too high meaning we couldn't book the longer treatments that we would have liked. It's also impossible to get a booking at a time that suits you due to limited staff (and we were there during a quieter week!)    5) The hotel does have a gym in a pretty courtyard on a sunken level but it is tiny and doesn't have much equipment. We therefore only used it once and thought it could use some updating.    Overall we had a thoroughly enjoyable stay and would return to Tigmiza. It's a beautiful oasis just outside of Marrakech and has everything you would ever need in a hotel. The staff are excellent and very helpful the hotel itself is clean and well kept. We also met some lovely couples there during our stay. I'd definitely recommend it for couples and families - It is lovely and quiet making it a peaceful place to relax and unwind.

Although the hotel is about 20 minutes from the centre of Marrakech this was not a problem because there is a free minibus to and from the centre.

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,MauriceVE wrote a review Jan 2020,50,"Wonderful hotel, nice and quiet and excellent service",We went for a short trip to Marrakesh and decided not to stay in the city itself because of all the hustle and bustle around New Year's Eve and because we wanted to go to a place with a spa.    Our first contact with the hotel was with the concierge who was able to arrange our transit from the airport by one of their shuttle busses. The concierge was very friendly and helpful and was able to help us with restaurant and taxi reservations as well.    The rest of the staff is also very friendly and helpful. They even allowed us to view one of the little villas that for a possible future family trip.    The rooms are wonderfully decorated and each room has a unique design. The rooms are clean and at night they will come round to check if you need any more towels. The rooms themselves are located in the main building of the hotel around the heated swimming pool. I can imagine that if you're located in a room on the bottom floor you could be somewhat inconvenienced by the noise of people walking past your room or guests using the heated pool but on the top floor we didn't hear any other guests even though the hotel appeared to be fully booked.    There is a second pool (and the villas all seem to have their own pools) with a pool bar which serves excellent food and again has friendly staff. The pool itself was a bit too cold for my taste but it was nice enough to relax around.    Breakfast is also good with a lady that makes fresh msemmen and other Moroccan pastries and a cook who will make you a fresh omelette. The breakfast buffet itself offers enough for everyone so no complaints there either.    We also tried the Moroccan restaurant in the hotel (we actually dined in the other restaurant but we could choose from the Moroccan menu). the dishes we tried were also really nice so we would recommend to dine there at least once (make a reservation though).    My wife tried the spa as well and she was really pleased with the beauty treatments they have on offer.    In all we were very pleased with this hotel and when we visit Marrakesh again we will almost certainly come here again.,Date of stay: January 2020,,"Amstelveen, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MauriceVE

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,benne74 wrote a review Jan 2020,50,Almost Fantastic,"The hotel is just outside of Marrakech the hotel has shuttle services and private transfers at very reasonable price. The atmosphere and the compound itself is a lust for the eye and very well maintained. Upon check in we were upgraded to 1 1 bedroom villa that is almost as big as my own house. The decor is just amazing! So is the staff so very courteous and friendly. My personal thank you to Lemia & Amine for their personal care advise and all queries asked and intervention in regards to choosing private tours. We stayed here 4 nights and had dinner 3 times in the hotel restaurants ( 2) both nights the main meal was served almost cold. After having said this the F&B staff tried their best to resolve the matter never the less the food they serve is AWESOME !!! as for drinks remind yourself "" you are not in the city"" but just outside the prices are ridiculous: 25CL beer: 5.5 euros glass of wine 1000 euro's and 25 euro's for a nespresso capsule ( besides the 6 offered by the hotel) knowing that I gladly admit I had a wonderful stay I was amazed by the friendliness of the staff I had the best night sleep in years ( what a nice bed)  everything was great. I loved the rain shower in the bathroom. Very happy to have been just outside the city and the fairly priced personal transfer from hotel-city-airport. Besides that option the hotel also offers free shuttle services on specific times. Once gain: I truly recommend Tigmiza and their staff.

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Michael M wrote a review Jan 2020,50,A refined oasis!,This place is quite lovely.    Our villa was elegant and luxurious (but not garish) at the same time as being quiet and tranquil - exactly what we had hoped for when seeking a week of relaxation in Marakech!    The hotel setting is magical - the gardens and pools are exactly as the pictures suggest - beautiful. Even when the hotel is full (as I assume it was) you rarely bump into staff or other guests (unless you are by the main pools or at breakfast).    The service was impeccable in every respect - the concierge Lamia is extremely helpful (eg arranging local excursions and giving advice on where to eat out); indeed all the staff were fantastic.    This hotel is very good value for money given the advertised prices of some of the comparable hotels and Riads. Indeed given the (comparatively inexpensive) price this is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in!    The location is important to note - the hotel is not in town. However that is mostly a positive (in my view) as the hotel becomes something of a restful haven away from the noise and hustle and bustle of Marakech. The hotel has a couple of vans and a mini-bus which provide a free shuttle service into town three times a day. Or in our case if you are tardy the hotel will take you into town at any hour for a very good price (charged to your room) and taxis are available to the hotel 24 hours a day. Considering it is a boutique hotel this worked extremely efficiently!    It is very hard indeed to fault this place.,Date of stay: December 2019,,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelmT9100MA

Each room is in a different style (Chinese Indian Gold & Black etc.).  Hotel has three amazing pools one more beautiful than the other. We were there in mid September so had the pools almost for us.  We booked half-board so we could choose between the Maroccan and International restaurant (starter main and dessert). Very very delicious !  There is as well a gym and a Spa as well as a cinema that we privatized one evening for a film of our choice.  If you want to relax for a couple of days in Marrkesh I can only recommend this hotel! One of the best hotels I ever stayed in.    One negative point is to mention: the day of our departure we stayed at the hotel until 4 pm. As we let the room earlier we needed to take a shower right next to the pool and needed to change in the cinema room. For a 5 star hotel the hotel should offer a proper changing room with a shower (which is available in the Spa for example).,Date of stay: September 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/965nicos

We’d spent a few days in the Médina and then travelled to Tigmiza to relax for a few nights.    Unfortunately I was unwell when checking in but the reception staff were welcoming and looked after us even upgrading us to a stunning villa with its own pool so I could relax and get well in comfort which was really appreciated.    The villa was beautiful with everything we could need we spent most of our time at the villa pool but the other pools were well maintained and had plenty of sunbeds etc.    We also made use of the cinema and the spa and the gym all great additions! As per a few previous reviews the gym could benefit from some heavier weights and the cinema from some more up to date films only minor points though.

Whenever we wanted to go to the Médina or anywhere else we could go by taxi or free shuttle from the hotel to the center.  Everything was good or excellent from the moment we arrived at the hotel. They upgraded us which was very nice but even if they didn’t it would have been excellent anyway. The hotel itself is awesome the decoration the furniture the food (I hate lamb) the swimming pools and all the areas are magnificent and very well thought... it’s very but very good to relax 🥰🥰🥰.  The staff was very friendly I have to say that for the very 1st time I contact them to make my reservation they were also very professional . I want to thank Lamia (Concierge) on behalf of all employees (pool bar restaurants housekeeping I didn’t use the SPA) for their attitude and attention to keep our experience the very best.

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,charlotte753 wrote a review May 2019,50,Beautiful hotel,We’ve just returned from a 5 night stay here with our 3 children (aged 11 8 and 6). It really is a stunning place.    The rooms are lovely. We stayed in one of the 2 bed villas which was perfect for us (our kids are happy to share a large double bed). The rooms were super clean with cleaners in every day leaving bottled water each morning. The bathrooms were large and done to a high standard.    The pools were fab. We particularly liked the heated pool; the kids loved it in there and we could lie by the side surrounded by the banana trees with birds cheeping in the background felt like the tropics :-) The loungers round the other pools were really comfy and there are plenty of them too. There were a few times at the beginning of our stay when I was worried our kids were a bit noisy as the feel was generally quite tranquil and they are not however we weren’t made to feel uncomfortable and the kids soon got the hang of the quieter environment.    We used the spa which was excellent. We took the kids for their first ever kiddies massage which they loved and was reasonably priced. We also used the cinema which the kids were thrilled with although the film choices are a bit limited but fab as an added bonus for our stay. We also used the shuttle bus a couple of times to go into the town which was straight forward and easy to use.    Breakfast was great with a good selection of fruit pastries bread cereal eggs and some meats (even pork bacon which I wasn’t expecting). We ate at the morrocan restaurant one night which was very nice and had the rest of our meals from the pool bar/room service. I was a bit nervous about eating the salads and fruit going on the usual travel advice but we all did and had absolutely no problems at all.    My only slight gripe was the food service times. For adults it’s probably fine but the pool bar closes at 4pm and the evening restaurants don’t open until 7.30 (although it was 8pm when we stayed due to Ramadan). For us this was a bit tricky as it’s quite a big window when our kids would usually be eating when the only option was room service. The room service menu is ok but fairly limited and quite a bit more expensive than the regular menu and is unpredictable in terms of service time. However the staff were really accommodating especially with generous helpings of nutella to go with the bread basket for our chocoholic children ;-)    All in all we had a great time. I would definitely recommended this hotel and would come back again. It was perfect luxury but without being pretentious or stuffy.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlotte753
Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,reluctantvoyager wrote a review May 2019,40,Comfortable quiet and welcoming,Difficult this one. It's very hospitable quiet with two good sized pools and two restaurants; the beds are very comfortable and the staff are attentive and friendly. In peak season the hotel might begin to feel a little packed out.    But for me it has two disadvantages - it's about 20 minutes by car from the Medina so travelling in and out is a bit of a pain. And the food served by the Tigmiza restaurants is indifferent in quality and expensive in price. If all you want is to relax around the pool this is perfect. But if you wish to explore a bit you are stuck with the hotel minibus timetable or calling on the hotel's taxi services or dealing with the crappy and uncertain local taxi crooks.

Our villa was amazing with all amenities to hand.  We had the most comfortable bed ever experienced for a hotel so well done management!  The whole hotel was immaculate and decorated with fresh roses which added a luxurious feel to the whole building.  Nothing was too much trouble and the reception and concierge service second to none.  The spa facilities were also very reasonably priced and excellent value for money and most importantly provided wonderful treatments.  We dined in both restaurants and the food was delicious.  As there is a free shuttle bus don’t think the hotel is too far out as it was a welcome relief to come back to a calm and peaceful oasis.

Breakfast is good as well as the pool restaurant lunch choices. We had dinner two times in the restaurants in the hotel and that was a bit of a disappointment (we had very good dinner experience in the restaurants in the new city). In addition there were birds in the restaurant during the breakfast that ate the breads. Gym was a disappointment (small) but the SPA is lovely and reasonable priced. Staff is friendly and all arrangements worked well. I think this is a good choice for people who want to relax by the pool and have some daily excursions in the city.

The accommodation was truly splendid and characteristic and although being told the hotel was full we never felt it as there were plenty of sunbeds available and service around the pools was impeccable.

Again nothing was too much trouble and they made so much effort it was truly remarkable.    Breakfast was always a pleasure and the waiters were helpful and understanding.

Our room was lovely it was more of a suite. The shower was so nice to just stand in... maybe for too long. ha!

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Sarah R wrote a review Jul 2018,50,Great place to rest and relax,We spent 3 nights this July at Tigmiza Suites and enjoyed it very much. The whole area including 3 pools restaurants rooftop bar cinema gardens the suites SPA etc are in a very good condition which helps a lot to feel very comfortable right from the beginning.  After checking in we were offered traditional morrocan tea and biscuits. The suite we stayed in was a maisonette with living room downstairs and bedroom as well as bathroom upstairs.  We booked a massage at the SPA which we can really recommend!  Food was served in the restaurant as well as at the pool bar. Breakfast varied not that much each day but thas was totally fine since everything you ask for was offered - fresh fruits pancakes different types of bread/rolls morrocan delicacies cereals cake egg (different kinds) fresh juices etc.  Dinner was a la carte and very delicious too! We enjoyed the typical Tajine duck beef etc. Everything really nice and prepared very well.  Staff was helpful at any time and also very friendly.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Mannheim, Deutschland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/schuh_10

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,anna-marie26 wrote a review Jun 2018,40,Not quite a 5*,The first thing I will say about this hotel is that it is absolutely beautiful. The grounds are well maintained and it is a very relaxing place to stay. We travelled in May and the hotel was very quiet. Each day you could count the number of people on one hand who joined us around the pool – bliss! The towels are ready and waiting for you on the sun loungers and you don't need to worry about fighting over sun beds. All the staff are incredibly friendly can't fault this and if you have an issue they will fix it. We arranged a transfer to the hotel – they offer a free pick up service from the airport. However we were already staying in Marrakech so I called to ask if pick up could be arranged from the Medina and they kindly sorted this for us free of charge.    There were a number of things that dropped it down to a 4* for me. The first being on the day we arrived the check in process was painfully slow much slower than any other hotel I've been to before I have no idea what took them so long!    We were then showed to our room which was really beautiful close to the pool luxurious and comfortable. However there was an overpowering smell of drainage coming from the shower! We complained about this and had to wait until the next day to move rooms (understandable as the hotel was full). The next day we were told we had received an upgrade to a villa which we were more than happy at the sound of. On first impressions it was very nice however once we actually settled in and had a look around the first room we had in the main building was so much nicer! The villas are not luxurious they're tired and dated and need some TLC. If we could have put up with the drainage smell we would have stayed in the original room. The villas are much more expensive than the hotel rooms so I wouldn't waster your money on them. The shower and bathroom didn't feel clean it was very old. Not a patch on the hotel rooms. We were only staying at the hotel for 3 nights so couldn't be bothered with the hassle of complaining again so stayed put.    The villa also backed on to the pool bar which had a table football and on our last night all we could hear were people playing on this loudly until late in the night – not ideal when you have an early morning flight!    Another thing to mention is the ants (or killer ants as we called them)! They're absolutely massive and we suffered a couple of bites from them. They're all around the pool area so hard to avoid and you'll certainly feel it if one nips you. The hotel should really try to do something to control this problem. We also had a couple in our room.    The food was ok. Not much selection in the restaurant especially for a vegetarian the hotel needs to cater more for this. We were also charged on check out for a drink from the mini bar which we did not have. We told them this and we had to write and sign a note to the manager to state we didn't have it?! So make sure you double check your bill when you leave.    We took advantage of the free shuttle service which leaves at 7pm to the Medina – great idea! The return sets off at 10pm so you get a good few hours there. However we arrived back to the pick up point at 9:55pm and the driver was already driving off without us! We had to flag him down.    The final thing to note is the god awful music around the pool. If I heard Ed Sheeran on repeat one more time I was going to rip the speaker from the ground!,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anna-marie26
Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Tasukete wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Great few days,Tigmiza is a beautiful property but outside of the city. We planned out trip well since we came to Tigmiza first to rest and relax before we continued on to other locations. The pick up from the airport was free and very smooth. Driver was already there and very professional with a nice mini bus just for us. The personnel at the resort is wonderful and we really appreciated the super service. We were upgraded to a 2 level 2 bedroom villa with a pool and that was absolutely fantastic! It was my mother’s birthday and they sent a cake almost immediately! The whole villa was fantastic and having private space outdoors was a dream come true. My only comments would be to have a hair dryer in the downstairs bathroom and to groom the outdoor space a little.  The breakfast is fantastic and available early (for those who wake up with the roosters). Plenty of selections and in a beautiful setting. Dinner was a little pricey and really mellow. The property while large in size is fairly small clientele wise so there just aren’t that many people to create a very social vibe and during the day its fantastic because it doesn’t feel crowded but at night it’s a tad of a let down. In either case the shuttle is available into the city and is very punctual that we found useful.  The biggest reason for the 5 stars is just the fantastic service. Not too forceful but available and very pleasant. Anything we called for was taken care of right away and the management is top notch. The upgrade of course just made our stay over the top wonderful. Probably the best sleep I had in a while! Thank you!,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Boston, Massachusetts",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tasukete

It is my third time in Marrakech and it didn't disappoint. We were delighted to stay in a private pool villa which was fabulous; peaceful and private. The hotel grounds are stunning and very well maintained with glorious bougainvillea and palm trees everywhere. The staff are lovely and friendly. Particular thanks to Hamild the charming waiter spa therapist Loubna for an incredible facial and Abdul for cheerfully carrying all our shopping! The spa is divine and the treatments very good. We loved the rooftop bar and ate in the restaurant a couple of times the food was not amazing but of a good standard and priced as one would expect in a five star hotel.

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Taylor C wrote a review May 2018,50,Amazing stay at this beautiful hotel,We stayed here 8th-11th of May.  From the transfer picking us up from the airport i cannot fault this Hotel. We was welcomed by Mint tea & pastries which were delicious. Then we were shown around the grounds & to our rooms. We travelled as a group of 4 friends & booked 2 suites. We stayed in the Art Deco room which was stunning & spacious. Our friends in the Le Vert room. They wasn't as happy as us with their room but after the Owner had introduced herself we explained this and 2 days later she had upgraded them to a Villa which made their stay so much more better.    The Hotel itself was beautiful so many little touches that made it unique. The Pools both lovely & clean.  The breakfast was nice too good variety & all presented nice. Outside they had people making homemade Moroccan breads & omelettes.  The staff were so friendly and always happy to help.  The shuttle bus we used twice it was handy to have as you are around 25 minutes from the centre of Marrakech.    Cannot recommend this place enough if you are looking for a stunning 5* hotel with a traditional decor & Dont't want to be right in the centre.    Thanks again! We will be back soon.,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Essex, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tayl0rcc
Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,supm wrote a review Apr 2018,50,Tranquility at Tigmiza,We stayed at Tigmiza for a week in March on the recommendation of Jono Vernon Powell of Nomadic Thoughts travel company. The hotel is absolutely beautiful decorated to a high standard with wonderful staff who cannot be faulted. They are totally professional but also very friendly and there is an air of everyone being very well looked after.    The management both in the main reception area and in the restaurant are very visible and ensure everything runs smoothly. We found that all the residents would chat to each other ask how your day was and share trip ideas and we really enjoyed that. The hotel never feels impersonal in that sense.    We had a beautiful villa with its own small swimming pool which felt a little chilly for me. However the main pool and the heated one were both gorgeous and very much enjoyed. Food at Tigmiza is great and we especially enjoyed eating at the traditional Moroccan restaurant in the outside conservatory. Don’t miss trying tagine! A shuttle bus is free several times a day but taxis weren’t too expensive so we often used them too.    Suffice to say we look forward to returning to Tigmiza hopefully in the autumn. It is a hotel we will definitely visit again.,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/supm
Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,KMM7 wrote a review Apr 2018,50,Short break,When we booked this and read reviews you have the odd reservation.  All reservations were soon forgot about on this occasion.  From the moment the complimentary driver picked us up from the airport everything exceeded my expectations.  The staff were polite friendly and always happy to help the accommodation and grounds were perfect and immaculate.  The food was of a good standard.  Reviews about drop off point and shuttle to Médina are a bit misleading all hotels seem to only have one drop off point you expect a bit of hassle from street sellers but nothing to pressuring and you get used to it.    The only let down on this occasion was the weather but will book tagmiza again without hesitation.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KMM7

The rooms and facilities are well appointed with emphasis on space and cool and efficient calm. Beware that there is nowhere to go to shop or eat out within a twenty to thirty minute trip out so if you don't want to rely on in-house food and refreshment at Hotel prices then some good planning is required. We had several trips out mainly prebooked - and utilised the transfer facility provided by Tigmiza so did not feel isolated.

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Ronald_jelle wrote a review Mar 2018,30,"A fine stay, but still room for improvement.",We stayed here for three nights our best stay in Marrakech and one of our best stays in Morocco but still it wasn’t close to perfection yet.    We had booked a villa for the six of us it had spacious rooms and a two bathrooms of which the one on the first floor had a nice big bath. We had a problem with getting the room cool on the last night I decided to open the balcony door to get a breeze of fresh air good we didn’t come in summer. We had two extra beds to fit all of us only one of the base frames was not complete and some parts were loose good thing my son was light and small otherwise he would have fallen in his sleep.    Apart from that all was fine in the villa although we would have liked more bottles of water and a water cooker.    The garden is not completely well kept but not so bad that it gets annoying... we had a pool but not one that is big enough to swim more one to cool off a bit good thing the hotel has three more pools in the garden.    The children’s play area is rather small and as the area was kept wet all the days we were there it was too muddy to let the children play there (unless your prepared to have two sets of clothes a day for them). Inside the hotel had games which was good on the rainy day however most games missed items or were broken (like connect) however that is not something that you can blame the hotel for more the other guests.    The restaurant (well officially there are two but the food comes from the same kitchen and the Moroccan restaurant hasn’t got much more choice of Moroccan food as the other international one) is fine just a limited choice of food but the staff is friendly and very helpful. Perhaps it would be an idea to add a children’s menu.    One thing I clearly didn’t like was that the shuttle each time stopped in front of the so-called guides... The drive should keep them at a distance so you can step out and make up your mind.... this really spoiled my mood both days we were dropped at the Jemaa el-fna. You don’t need the shuttle but it saves you looking for parking space. It would be nice if there could be more time between drop-off and Pick-up time or add an extra ride. Another thing that I didn’t like were people smoking in the lobby to be honest I was surprised to see that this was still allowed... The first place in years where I saw this.    Overall it was a fine stay the hotel is quiet is by car 20 to 30 minutes from the center of town and is a good option when staying in Marrakech but there are still things that can be improved t make it better. We would certainly consider coming back another time.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"The Hague, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ronald_jelle
Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,WiltshireTraveller66 wrote a review Feb 2018,50,A true oasis - Serenity in a tropical setting,I came with a friend for 3 nights to chill. Not having been to Morocco before we were unsure as what to expect. But from the moment you arrive at the airport (which is only 1 year old with stunning architecture) to the arrival at the hotel everything was perfect.    The hotel itself is a gem beautifully decorated and we had the La Zen room in peaceful light colours right by the heated pool and surrounded by banana trees.    The breakfast spread was beautiful and the omelette station together with Moroccan pancakes was outside in the courtyard. Unfortunately it was just a little too chilly to sit and eat breakfast outside in February.    We also had the half-board option and whilst it was not made clear to us we figured out that we could choose a three course meal from the A la carte menu. We shared and tried different dishes and they were all splendid. We particularly rated the Chicken Royale Tagine which we think was the best dish on the menu. We also tried the Moroccon red wine which was very nice and I would not hesitate to order it again.    Towards the end of the stay I became poorly and the hotel manager could not do enough to make my last day more comfortable. He called for a doctor who gave me a jab to ensure that I was at least fit enough to get home. The Moroccans are very polite smiling and caring people and we found them to be most charming. Nothing was too much trouble for them.    The free shuttle bus into town works really well and they offer it twice a day - from 10.00 to 1300 and then 1900-2200 for those that want to eat in town.    Overall a wonderfully relaxing hotel in amazing grounds - it is a true little oasis far enough away from the humdrum of the city!

Breakfast had several choices of freshly cooked eggs or pancakes as well as a selection of hot and cold food and drinks. We had lunch by the pool which was reasonably priced tasty and huge portions. We also ate in the restaurant one evening which was lovely too especially the triple chocolate dessert. We each had a wonderful massage in the beautiful spa and the rest of the time we relaxed in the sunshine. Throughout the hotel the staff were friendly and helpful nothing was too much trouble; they booked taxis and a guide for our day trip and various restaurant bookings. We were upgraded to an AMAZING suite which obviously made our stay brilliant but it was the staff that made it perfect.

Although the room that I shared with my husband was nicely furnished. The only down side was that there was no natural light that came into the room as we had to keep the blinds closed throughout our stay to maintain optimum privacy. My friends stayed in one of the suites with its own pool. The suite although spacious was tired and in need of an update. The private pool was more of a plunge pool that an actual swimming pool. The food was decidedly average the staff were unfriendly and unhelpful. I also resented having to pay for bottled water when this should have been provided for free.

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Tim O wrote a review Nov 2017,40,Great hotel and resort…but one major niggle!,Tigmiza Suites & Pavilions is an exceptional resort in Marrakech. The service from every single member of staff was exceptional - just flawless.    We stayed here for a week in one of the Pavilions Suites and we were very impressed with the suite and the hotel in general.    The prices are reasonable and the resort is located outside of the city but is very accessible with the free courtesy shuttle bus laid on by the hotel.    There are a few constructive criticisms regarding our visit but worthy of consideration if you are considering booking here.    We visited 27th October to 3rd November. The beautiful upstairs terrace bar was closed and there is just one restaurant open. The only other bar in the hotel is small and intimate and has a fairly limited choice of drinks and cocktails. BUT..the service is very warm and attentive!    The pool bar serves great food during the day but you will be limited for dining options at the hotel. The food and drink in the main restaurant is both excellent and very reasonably priced. The breakfast is also superb - plenty of choice - including a delicious hot and cold buffet    Facilities: There is a small gym. If you want to use the Spa and get a massage - book ASAP otherwise you won’t get in. Wifi is a bit patchy but free. There is a fantastic cinema rom you can book out for a private movie. A nice touch although we didn’t get to use it.    The BIG issue for me were the pools. They have three beautiful pools but in all my years traveling I have never seen them so under utilized. Why?    Because the temperature of the pools was VERY cold. I measured less than 20 degrees celcius! (68F) . Too cold for kids and too cold to have a relaxing dip. The outside temperature during our visit was very warm - 29-32 celcius. I am guessing the pools are chilled as in the summer the temperatures can exceed 50 celcius. This was the biggest disappointment for me.    From the 1st November they heat the ‘inside’ pool…and guess what there were plenty of people using it! I have never thought to ask a hotel about the temperature of a pool before…but this experience means I will in the future!    The courtesy shuttle is free and it takes about 30 minutes to get to the Medina - leaving at 10am returning 1pm - it gives you around 2.5 hours there - and leaves at 1pm therefore no opportunity for lunch. Similarly in the evening - it leaves at 7pm - arrives at the Medina at 7:30pm and then picks you up at 10pm - so you can either have a good browse around the souks OR have an evening meal…on a tight timeline. Tigmiza should definitely change these timings….you need at least 5 hours to browse the souks and have a meal.    Again I would like to reiterate the quality of the accommodations is excellent and the levels of service and focus from staff on ensuring guest satisfaction cannot be faulted - very impressive!    If you are looking for a peaceful tranquil break but would like access to all that Marrakech offers then the Tigmiza is a great choice.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hermosa Beach, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timoV7572DH
Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,JustinT wrote a review Oct 2017,50,a very enjoyable and relaxed stay at Pavillon Bambous,Overall a very relaxing stay at the hotel.    Credits to the receptionist Lamya who was extremely helpful and polite. We were given a brief tour of the hotel after the obligatory mint teas and biscuits whilst the room was being prepared. The scenery at the roof top over the palmerie was nice during sunset. We stayed at Pavillon Bambous the super king sized bed was comfortable and room was spacious even for a young family of 3 like us. There were 3 pools and there were always plenty of sun loungers by the pool to read a book or take a nap while watching the kids having fun. We dined at the hotel a few times as we were a little tired of having tagines after tagines. I never knew that the sight of the odd hamburgers and pasta was capable of sending tingles to my palates. Food/drinks were inexpensive.  Though the hotel provides shuttle service to Medina twice a day the time didnt always suit us. The hotel charges 150dirham (billed to the room) for a trip to centre of town. We paid the same amount of taxi fare in the evening to return to the hotel and was told beforehand by the hotel staffs that taxi fares incur extra charge after 6pm I am sure you can haggle the fare down just like most things in Marrakech but we didnt bother. One taxi driver told us he would charge only 50 dirham but kept increasing the fare as he was driving eventually I told him I was not going to pay 1 cent more than 150 dirham (I know everyone has to make a living)    The only negative point was the 30min delay when we were supposed to be picked up at the airport apprently the driver was waiting in the vehicle in the car park that I was not aware of. I would expect the driver to be waiting at least at the exit holding a piece of paper with my name on it.    Overall it was a very pleasant stay. I was certain that time slows down in the hotel a stark contrast to the hustle and bustle in the medina.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JustinT
Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,AmanDhami wrote a review Oct 2017,30,Good Stay,Positives  - Good food quality and presentation  - Beautiful and clean pools  - Boutique hotel feel and not a big chain hotel  - villas with private pool worth the additional cost for the extra space.  - staff work hard and provide good service with a smile.  Free shuttle bus twice a day 10am - 1pm and 7-10pm    Not so positives  - room dusty on arrival (but then this is morocco and I am asthmatic)  - loungers by pool could do with upgrading to a more comfortable brand  - towel set up in room only for two people when 3 are staying in a two bathroom villa. Which means you have to call housekeeping to tell them to give you more at which point they don't and you go to reception to explain yourself and the reception manager in a very condescending tone draws pictures of how many beds are in the villa! Uuuumm all I want is a towel set up for 3 people including 3 robes and not 2 (3rd robe never showed during our 4 night stay)  - as another reviewer pointed out you have to pay for additional tea bags when your complimentary tea bags in the room finish! 70 dhirams (£6) for 4 teabags!!! And they don't explain this to you. That's just dropping tea bags to your room! It's cheaper to order a cup of tea in room!  - French is the preferred language. Staff do speak English but you may find your request is lost in translation.  - don't book via booking.com or an agent. Book directly and you get a better price and additional promotions such a free return shuttle to the airport. Book through a 3rd party and they charge you for a return trip at €25.  - return to the third pool the next day and drink glasses from the day before are still on the side tables and have not been removed or cleaned!!  - front of house reception staff (except the lovely lady in the evenings) could all do with a training session in customer service and hospitality. Kind on check in and then totally disinterested at check out and during the stay!    When you book to stay in a 5 star hotel you shouldn't have to chase housekeeping for towels or ask for glasses cups to be removed. Sometimes it's the smaller details that call out a 5 star hotel.    We celebrated a special milestone birthday but the hotel did nothing to make it special.    Would I stay again probably not. I'd probably try the four seasons mandarin oriental or Lodge K next time.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmanDhami

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,amchoukir wrote a review Sep 2017,50,A week in paradise,Our family is scattered across 4 countries and we like to all meet once a year to catchup and enjoy relaxing and joyful moments. We found the Tigmiza Pavillons & suites on booking the pictures looked stunning but I must say reality was better. The resort is in the middle of the palm oasis of Marrakech. The resort is fitted with 3 swimming pools including one which is integrated with the main building under the shadow of the surrounding walls and palm trees. A pool bar serves lunch around the second pool. Breakfast and dinner are served in the main building. In terms of accommodation the resort offers suites which are spacious and luxurious bedrooms and villas. The villas come with private swimming pools :-) for more intimacy. The staff and management were very friendly and managed to accommodate us close together with a commercial gesture. The resort also offers a movie theater that can be reserved which is awesome for a family. They also feature a spa with Sauna hamam beauty and massage. We tested the massage and they were pretty good normally I find them too soft or too hard but it was just about right. One additional benefit is that they have a shuttle from the airport and to the city. The latter is very practical given the type of traffic one can see in Marrakech.,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Lausanne, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amchoukir

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Hannah wrote a review Sep 2017,50,Moroccan Haven,We could not find fault at Tigmiza - a luxurious haven just outside of Marrakech. The staff were friendly and helpful and made our stay perfect. Food drinks accommodation and facilities were excellent. Whilst not the cheapest option we found it good value for money and well worth it with a high standard of quality throughout. There was some confusion between facilities advertised on the website and those available at the time of our stay but this was not a problem (for example there is just one dinner time restaurant). As with all hotels in Morocco alcohol was a little on the expensive side but there are mini-fridges within the villas and a supermarket nearby should you wish to BYO. Whilst we were told the hotel was very busy there were very few guests creating a very relaxing and chilled environment - not the place to stay if you are after hustle and bustle which we were not. Staff went above and beyond to make arrangements for a special occasion with no hassle and a friendly smile. We will be back and would recommend to anyone looking for a relaxing break in Morocco.,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Norwich, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cybergalhan

We only had time to squeeze in a small stay as our schedules are particularly busy but the staff atmosphere and services really did help us make the most of our time. Friendly and accommodating the staff took excellent care of us with very minimal disruption when fast is broken for the day (our visit was during Ramadan). The selection of wine is good especially the Moroccan Rose Gris fresh and cool perfectly for a poolside tipple. Food is very reasonably prices. The fillet Rossini I had for dinner (two nights in a row I may add) was STUNNING and a bargain at just over £12.    You certainly don't need to leave the hotel but if you're plans include a saunter into the city there are two shuttles a day (1000-1300 or 1900-2200). We were given excellent recommendations by guest services and even came home with a Beni Ourain rug from one of the studios we were recommended.

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Talia31 wrote a review May 2017,50,4 nights at Tigmiza,My husband and I booked 4 nights at Tigmiza to celebrate our 2nd wedding anniversary and what a wonderful place to do so! Situated about 20 minutes drive from the centre of Marrakech Tigmiza is a boutique hotel built in a typical riad style. The grounds rooms and communal areas are all gorgeous and an absolute pleasure to be in. Although there are only a few guest rooms there are plenty of places to sit eat drink swim - just be! It never felt busy or crowded the ambience was fabulous. All the food we consumed at the hotel was excellent although we found the lunch menu to be rather limited and if we were staying any longer than we were would have become quite repetitive. The staff and service exceed their 5* rating. We didn't use the spa but we did book into the cinema room which was brilliant! A nice little escape from the 40 degree heat for a couple of hours! The 3 pool areas are all lovely and very well maintained I'd perhaps like to take this opportunity to suggest a new CD for playing around the pool? By day 3 it was starting to become a tiny bit annoying!

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Ollyc1962 wrote a review May 2017,50,An escape to luxury,As you finally escape the airport a contrary modern building with all the efficiency of a medieval horse trading market you are greeted by the Tigmiza hotel's driver and whisked away from the endless bag checks and paper stamping.  Not that any air-bound trip these days is without security checks and a little light frisking in fact there is a comforting aspect to it all when you leave Morocco but once you've arrived picked up your luggage and exited all the usual departments it does seem to be locking the stable door after the horse has bolted somewhat for them to check your bags as you leave the building.  Oh well the smart mini-van speeds you away from it all and all is forgotten as you wind your way through the Marrakech streets and your driver takes the opportunity to check his texts.  The first impression is that this city is the land that 'health and safety' forgot. Children on moped handlebars or sandwiched between parents on the back seat and daredevils crossing streets in fast moving traffic who step out while still looking at their phones. It's best not to look or you'd be screaming 'WATCH OUT!!!' every two seconds.  And then as the main roads leave the bustle of the old town and the buildings transform in to dusty desert with a hazy view of the Atlas mountains in the distance the hotel and deafening silence is upon you.  First impressions are of a quite and cool beautifully designed Moroccan home that you are now an important guest in. The staff are charming and keen to please which adds to the welcoming atmosphere.  They take you round the whole building the rooftop bars the lounge areas and the two pool areas and not forgetting the spa area in the lower part of the building.  The upstairs bar deserted at 11am in the morning as we took the tour seemed full of promise and we mentally made a note to visit later for a few cocktails.  However in the week we were there we never saw anyone up there. This may have been due more to the time of year - term time - than any lack of enthusiasm on the hotel's part as the majority of guests seemed to be young couples with preschool children or older couples like ourselves (okay late middle aged) so the hotel was largely dormant in terms of wild nightlife.( unless you count the wedding in the rear garden area!)  We were lucky enough to get an upgrade to a villa with a pool which was spectacular and we felt very spoilt. We didn't actually spend any time around our own private pool as it felt a little like we hadn't come all this way to sit in a small semi-detached back garden with a pool the size of a double bed however it was lovely to sit by with an evening drink and the sun warming our faces as it set.  The hotel runs a shuttle in to the Medina which you do need to put your names down for. I think as Brits we naturally feel reassured by a few rules but to be honest they never checked our names on either journey and we could have just been two freeloaders if there was space you could always get a ride. We always take recommendations from the receptionist for dinner destinations as this was our first visit it's nice to visit the MUSTS without worrying too much about the more obscure restaurants at first. Although Maison D'Arab is magical and romantic. I would recommend asking the hotel for a guide around the Souk if its your first visit. Partly to avoid being hassled but mostly they take you to places you would never find on your own if you just decided to wander around and get lost. After almost five nights of Moroccan menus if you like Tajines I must admit that the best one I had was the first night in the hotel. We couldn't resist the vibrancy of the evening-Medina but the breakfasts at the hotel were wonderful so we made up for our lack of evening attendance.  While the rooms were beautiful and equipped well (possibly the only hotel in the world that's managed to put a plug point near a mirror - to my wife's delight) it is true that the pool area while lovely is in need of a little tender care.  Some people were surprised at the lack of cushions compared with the abundance of patio weeds creeping up between the slabs but this didn't distract from the overall serenity at all.  What was more annoying was that the beach practises of the tackier parts of the mediterranean had creeped in to the hotel grounds. The tradition of securing the best situated beds for an entire morning leaving them empty bar a paperback and some sun cream so that other guests too polite to evict the nicknacks themselves had to sit in less optimal areas while the guests responsible swanned about the Medina trying on scarves only to return suspiciously at the same time as the return shuttle did wind me up it must be said.  Even when we had a good spot ourselves! perhaps there should be some policy around this from the hotel? Nevertheless we would definitely recommend this hotel these tiny observations did nothing to dampen our enjoyment. In April the weather was just about right and the hotel provided the peaceful serenity and antidote to crazy magical full on madness of the old town.  Like the multitude of kittens who populate the streets of the Souk we arrived slightly wide-eyed and overwhelmed but left feeling topped up with culture sun and cuisine.

And I can gladly report that they’ve succeeded masterfully.    There are numerous things that know how to “charm” and “enrich” the experience:    It’s the understated Moroccan opulence of the interior that playfully integrates a slight touch of western luxury.    It’s the discreet lights that are lit all over the area at night which transform the resort into a sensual temple that seduces the guest to stroll around the premises.    It’s the carefully compiled menu that spoils one’s stomach with the gastronomic riches of Morocco and France.    And it’s last but foremost the staff. From receptionist to waiter cook and manager all embody what the pinnacle of hospitality is.

We stayed in one of the most beautiful spacious private villa with its own pool.... heaven! (There are 14 of these) This offered us privacy and an oasis of calm. It had a fabulous cozy alcove filled with cushions....perfect for lazy evening reading and relaxing!  The main building was beautifully decorated with many areas to relax. The spa was small but offered lovely hammam experience.... a must do whilst there! Breakfast on the terrace was a really lovely way to start the day..... super selection of food!  The quality of the food in the evening restaurant exceeded our expectation.... it had a lovely atmosphere with live background music played by 2 local men one evening.  The complimentary airport transfer is a welcoming touch... thank you! We took the free shuttle bus one evening to the Medina. This is a really authentic experience...... crowds chaos and a real eye-opener SO worth experiencing! I bought LOADS of beautiful baskets with sequins in many colours!  We will definitely return to Tigmiza as it offered us serious relaxation in a super setting! We have come home very chilled!

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Siobhan B wrote a review Mar 2017,50,A hidden Gem,Tigmiza is above and beyond everything we expected! It is an outstanding 5 star plus Hôtel  with a feel of the Colombe d'or in the S of France. We stayed in our own villa ( one of 12) and had our own pool which was beautifully decorated. The entire decor is of exquisite taste very chic and the gardens are so tropical and beautiful . The spa is very quaint  small but  Cosy . Surrounded by little turquoise tiles and underground heating. The Gym is very small with just a few machines. There is a private cinema that we hired out one night great fun .. they give you popcorn and it seats 8-10 or just  You if you like .. you chose your own movie:-)the Hôtel is 15-20 minutes from town which you can get to twice a day by their own free shuttle.. morning and evening. To finish the food is exceptional but the staff are what make this property a 'stand out'! Tarik the main man is there for your every need and nothing is too much trouble. Thank you for the most amazing 5 days. We will a hundred percent be back!!!,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Livvy2000
Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,O1557JZbobl wrote a review Mar 2017,50,Outstanding 5*,Wonderful experience at Tigmiza with kind courteous staff. Rooms are mini-suites all with individual modern but classic theme. Our room was The Chinoise or China Room. Hotel quality is far beyond our expectations and cleanliness was exceptional. Food was outstanding albeit if I did have to comment could do with a greater selection and possibly an alternative menu weekly?  Having said that we vacationed during the off-peak and some of the facility was not operational there are other restaurants and swim-up bar as well as Spa and Treatment Rooms. A small private Cinema is also available with some 300 films to choose from.  The Hotel is situated on the perimeter of Marakesh so quiet and peaceful with Free bus into town at 10am each morning and 7pm each evening.  If you want peace relaxation and time to reflect on life then this is your spot  My thanks to The Tigmiza team for thier outstanding service. It was a Privelidge to spend time with you.

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Raymond T wrote a review Feb 2017,50,Lovely stay and 5 stars experience!,We stayed 5 nights in Tigmiza and what a lovely 5 stars experience! The hotel is beautiful and luxurious. It has lots of trees spacious and have two pools (one heated). There are lots of areas to sit down and relax and you will never feel crowded.    Our suite is Anglais - it is a very classy beautiful and comfy English style room. We were told that each room is individually designed and inspired by different styles. The staffs are all very friendly and most spoke fluent English which is a plus for non-French speaking tourists like us.    The hotel is about 20-30 drive away from the City Centre. We often take the day-time shuttle to Medina and explore different part of the cities. And sometimes we take the night time shuttle to the city for dinner and explore the night market in the city. Sometimes you can also ask the driver to drop you off at different location if you want to visit some attractions.    The daily breakfast buffet is AMAZING with lots of fresh fruits cheese cakes drinks Moroccan crepes and you can get omelettes from the cook. For dinner you can Moroccan menu or international food if you prefer. There is a spa gym and a private cinema with a decent list of movies to choose from.    Thank you for the staffs at the Tigmiza we had a wonderful time here and especially Tarik who is very attentive and helpful to us.

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Annie P wrote a review Dec 2016,50,Peaceful Luxury,We chose this hotel because it was out of the centre of Marrakech and knew it would be a lovely tranquil antidote to the bustle of the city. We were not disappointed. Sumptuously appointed our suite (the Orientale) was beautiful and luxurious. We slept soundly the bathroom was wonderful and the decor magical. Definitely 5 star with robes slippers fruit on arrival good quality toiletries furnishings. The only improvement would be a kettle for tea/coffee making.  The hotel itself has a lovely heated pool which we were able to swim in even in December. There were many places to relax so even though there were relatively few guests whilst we stayed even when the hotel is busy I suspect it would never feel crowded.  The spa was fabulous and the hotel even boasts its own cinema (although we never used this: they maybe need to get a few more up to date films added to their list to choose from).  The food was simply amazing. We opted for half board: You could have breakfast and lunch or breakfast and dinner which meant your stay there could be flexible with outings and excursions. Breakfast was everything you would expect and things you might not expect in a predominantly Muslim country such as bacon! Omelettes were cooked in front of you by a lovely member of staff who presides in the courtyard. Whilst touching on the subject of culture alcohol is available and fairly reasonably priced.  The dinner menu was varied and interesting: A good range of Moroccan meals (the Lamb tagine being my personal favourite) and superb quality European food too (fillet steak cooked to perfection). The breads are also a highlight. We ate like kings!  Whilst on our stay we found the staff to be delightful. The manager was extremely helpful and all were courteous and went out of their way to make you feel at home. Most spoke good English and all French.  A special mention should be made to the chef. We spent a morning with him in the kitchen where he gave us a personal cookery lesson producing a traditional dish which we ate for our lunch. He was passionate about food and we really enjoyed the experience. I can highly recommend this to anybody staying here. That evening he cooked a special Moroccan taster menu for us which we could barely eat there was so much!  We have returned home feeling rested and relaxed. A superb holiday which did exactly what we wanted and more.

Villas and suites are big comfortable design and decoration might raise some discussions but nothing serious.  Good choice of food for any meal starting with great and freshly prepared breakfast. Overall food for lunch or dinner is OKeyich not wow. The same for service OK but you would expect little extra from 5 star hotel.

We booked a pavilion which was really nice and big they also provided a cot for our baby and a kettle so we could make her milk. Our baby had her first birthday while we were there and the hotel provided a free chocolate cake and came and sang happy birthday to her which was really nice.

What a disapointment the premises are outstanding but the rest....  - they put away the rest of the bottle of wine that we paid for we had to recuparate it;  - they were not able to change 45 euros (no cash available..)  - we ordered a taxi they forced us to take the hotel shuttle service with an incompetent driver at the cost of 225 dirham  - they asked 3 euros for an extra nespresso coffeee capsule in the room (explanation: only 3 capsules are included in the price no matter if you stay one ore more nights 3 capsules are maximum....)  - we asked the reception to make a reservation in a local restaurant they denied with the explanation that we have a phone in the room and could do it ourselves... Ok we did as we were told and had to pay in the end 2 euros for the local call....  - when we checked out nobody helped with the luggage they just said manage yourself  - only highlight: the breakfast!    We were asked - and paid - a five star price but there`s only little five star service. Five star level ist not deserved!

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Richard K wrote a review Nov 2016,50,Perfect hideaway,Warmly welcomed by reception staff on arrival after availing ourselves of the complimentary airport pickup. Art Deco Suite was lovely and overlooking the pool. Very quiet round the pool and hotel. We were literally the only people round the pool on one day. Lunch at the pool is pretty good and fairly priced. We only had dinner once at the hotel and we were not disappointed. Breakfast was great but my only criticism was that it was a little cool in the morning and a nice fireplace in the breakfast room would have taken the edge off and added to the ambiance. Perfect place for a short stay but probably not for a full week as there is very little to do other than relax.

The staff are very courteous and helpful with nothing being too much trouble.  The hotel is outside of the city but the free shuttle bus is good and after the hubbub of the city the calm of the hotel is very attractive.

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,j w wrote a review Oct 2016,50,AMAZING,So me and my friend are very busy individuals just like everyone BUT we planned this really last min and we were only there for 3 days 2 nights but it was the most amazing mini break we have ever had.    First of all the min we landed there was a lady who basically just planned our whole trip. We did camel riding/quad biking and we did atlas mountains. Then we were taken to tigmiza and just blown away with how beautiful this place is.    Its just out of marrekech so its a little far but the shuttle service twice a day was so good (one at 10 and the other at 7). The reception staff were so nice and excellent service esp Tariq and lamya who are really friendly. They even upgraded us as soon as we got there. They were so helpful in answering questions there sauna facilities are so relaxing we had a scrub and clean. They have 3 swimming pools- a tad bit cold But once you jump in its a lovely swim. The place itself is exquisite the art and deco of the various rooms are so different. You really feel relaxed. The breakfast--- where so i begin so much choice including fresh cooked omelettes and moroccan pancakes .    We both had an amazing time- the staff are professional- they hardly disturb you and are willing to answer any question u ask.

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Tom wrote a review Oct 2016,40,"5* range of facilities, with slightly underwhelming service",We recently spent a week at the Tigmiza which was thoroughly relaxing. The vast space and surroundings were beautiful- there were so many places to relax and have time to yourself which was great and a complete contrast to the centre. We kept discovering terraces and hidden spots throughout our time!    Reading the other reviews we were apprehensive about breakfast but we thought the range was fantastic- good selection of cooked and continental with chefs preparing personal omelettes and assorted versions of pancakes. However the other two meal times let the food down. The lunch menu at the pool bar was decent but the wait on the food often took up to an hour and almost every time we ordered food there was a mistake. At dinner time there was no atmosphere and some of the food lacked flavour- I would definitely recommend heading into the centre for dinner don't miss out on the amazing hidden gems. Three of our favourite restaurants were Pepe Nero I Limoni and Dar Atlas.    The cleanliness of the hotel was good and general friendliness of the staff was great- they were always smiling.    However unfortunately the attention to detail really lets the 5* aspect of the hotel down. The hotel has so much potential but isn't fully utilised. Our requests were very often forgotten about whether it was ice buckets towels and a birthday surprise for my partner which was promised before we arrived in Morocco but never materialised.    One of the most annoying aspects of the hotel was the free upgrade to the villas that so many guests receive- this needs to be consistent one way or another. We had previously read on Trip Advisor about the large amount of guests who received a free upgrade to a villa. We arrived with two other couples to the hotel and checked in at the same time- one couple was automatically upgraded FREE to a villa- however when we found out about this and asked about a possible upgrade we were told that it would be a surcharge and they had none available. Whilst we weren't too bothered by having a villa we felt slightly devalued as guests when at the very same time another couple received a free upgrade for the same reason as we requested (partners birthday).    Saying all of that I don't want to take away from the fact that this is a lovely hotel with many facilities (spa gym restaurants English bar many rooftop terraces 3 substantial pools). Also the free shuttle bus at 10am and 7pm every day into the centre of the city is always on time and a fantastic service. This is also time to get to know the other guests and we made many friends at Tigmiza. Whilst the staff lack the personal 5* attention you would assume in an establishment like this the staff are friendly and welcoming.

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Alan T wrote a review Sep 2016,10,"Booked for 7 nights, only stayed for 3 !!",Cats cats and more cats! They tried to get into our room were found by our pool on the restaurant terrace and on the tables inside the restaurant jumping up at you for food and even coming out of the door where the waiters come from the kitchen (although we were told the kitchen itself is downstairs) just everywhere! They know there is a problem but do not seem to know what to do about it. It is thoroughly unhygenic. We were told by one of the receptionists that many people had complained but that nothing was being done. My partner has recently had surgery on her leg and was very worried about being scratched and getting an infection so we asked to be moved to another hotel. To be fair this was accomplished within a couple of hours and we were given a choice of 2 hotels (both nearer the city). We chose Les Deux Ciels (see my review). The cat problem at Tigmiza was even known about there!    To review our somewhat shortened stay the hotel is supposed to be 5 stars and initial impressions were good. We had booked a pavillon but were given a 2 storey villa with pool (no-one told us this or asked if we wanted it). Lots of room 2 bathrooms big lounge/dining room own pool and small (totally unkempt) garden. Bedroom with lots of storage comfy bed and a balcony. Apart from the main front door it was very difficult to open any of the other outside doors as they scraped across the floor and none opened totally. Room was serviced very late each day around 5pm strange as in total there are only 27 “rooms” and the hotel was nowhere near full. The minibar was never restocked.    Breakfast was adequate once you dodged the cats. Lunch and dinner menus limited and not awfully good. The hotel has no real heart where people can interact and during our stay most people went into the Medina for dinner and few were around the pool during the day. No-one at all used the second pool which we discovered only by accident.    The grounds generally were a bit scruffy and the grass around our villa's pool was 6 inched long.    We did not use the spa.    The timings for the free bus to the centre of Marrakesh (about 20 minutes away) were strange as they made it very difficult to fit dinner in of an evening. It also appeared that if you were late for the 10pm return bus you got left behind and had to get a taxi back.    All in all much more like a 3 star than a five star.

Our Suite Indienne was so neat nicely furbished and cleaned twice a day  The facilities and pools are very clean and the people really take care of the environment.    Only downside was the food offered: breakfast where it lacks variety (choice and quality). The restaurant is overpriced and tries to hard to give a modern touch to their dishes (tajines salads) . We would have preferred to have very traditional dishes for good price. Same for room service food the Fish was too expensive (170 dirham if i recall) and not satisfying enough.

It is great to be able to have all your stuff around you and sunbathe swim relax and chill without having o leave the room indeed later in the week we started ordering room service because we enjoyed the tranquility so much. The staff are great helpful and friendly indeed we had a slight issue in that we had our return date wrong and missed our flights (well we thought we were flying back the following day). The hotel extended our stay by one night and we used the free in room wifi to book new flights. It was all sorted within half an hour and the hotel was great.    The location and weather were fabulous and the resort is gorgeous.

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Espiner1 wrote a review Jun 2016,50,EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS!,We arrived at Tigmiza after an early start and a long days travel from Luton London.    As part of our package deal we had many inclusions and were greeted by an extremely friendly punctual chauffeur who drove us back to the hotel. Immediately upon arrival we were sat in the stunning reception area and offered mint tea & pastries while our room was prepared.    As with all package deals we were expecting the website images to far exceed the hotel in reality however it blew us away. We stayed in the Art Deco suite which I cannot recommend enough it overlooked the main pool area yet was quiet & peaceful.    The hotel is perfect for a quiet relaxing break and had various tranquil pools to lounge at. The staff were extremely kind & friendly (especially Tariq at reception!!!). The only thing I would mention is that it took a while to be served by the pool and unfortunately the menu didn't feature any traditional Moroccan dishes and the Moroccan restaurant onsite at the hotel was only open Fridays and Tuesday's during the time we stayed so we would catch the free shuttle service to eat in the Medina every evening (not a bad compromise at all!)    The free shuttle service is fantastic however make sure you book the day before for the 10am service or the morning of for the 7pm service as it books up fast! The shuttle takes approx 20 mins to get in to the Medina. A taxi is approx £15 to get back if you stay out after 10pm.    I highly recommend this hotel and can't wait to go back for some R&R!,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"North Sydney, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Espiner1
Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Kraze18 wrote a review Jun 2016,50,Beautiful boutique hotel ... great break,Tigmiza is a lovely hotel. On arrival I was upgraded to a villa which was amazing. All of the rooms were huge beautifully decorated and clean and the villa had a private pool. The pools hotel gardens are all lovely and kept very neat - even spotted one of 4 of the resident tortoises!    The staff especially management are all very helpful and go out of their way to help - for example reserving a banoffee pie dessert one evening which the waiter already took care of as the message had been passed on. The hotel is quite small 28 rooms so the food is slightly limited but they offer a free shuttle bus into the medina so were able to eat out a couple of evenings too. You must visit the medina to get a sense of the real marrakech. Its busy and there are bikes everywhere but some real gem restaurants and friendly people.... a bit of french is useful here    Few little notes for improvement ... on both occasions when we ate breakfast early it was not ready and we had to delay our round of golf etc. Due to a workers protest breakfast moved location and not everything was set up in time ... similarly just as we were about to leave so we wern't able to enjoy a full breakfast.  Margarita Pizza was a bit bland at lunch but overall really lovely and would definitely recommend.    NB- We booked through Voyage Privee and you should note that the hotel require a card deposit on arrival which wasn't expected ... everything can be charged to this card (had cash so didn't use a great deal) but there are costs to factor in such as local charges and taxes - those plus a ride to the golf and back cost £60 approx.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kraze18
Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Elaine L wrote a review Jun 2016,50,What a fabulous experience,We booked in to Tigmiza suites for a little relaxation after staying in a riad in the centre of the medina for a few days. What a great decision! On our arrival we were delighted to be upgraded to a villa with a private pool by the charming manager who showed us roung himself. The accommodation is first class. Surprisingly the hotel was only built 4 years ago but the architecture and design makes it seem a real par of Morocco. There is a shuttle in to Marrakech which we didn't use as we had already visited but they kindly collected us from our previous hotel and this seemed an excellent service. The staff were all delightful. I have never thought before to go to Morocco just for out of season sun rather than sightseeing but I could easily be persuaded to return to Tigzima suites for this. I should also say that maybe we got cheap rates because it was ramadan and not high season but it was an absolute bargain around £50 a night for 3 of us in a villa which could of course have slept 4.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Faversham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elainelV8854QX
Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Pinky wrote a review Jun 2016,50,Heaven,If you want peace tranquility and seclusion then this is the perfect place to go! (It is 30 mins from Marrakech town which you can use the free shuttle. There really is nothing at all nearby the hotel). We were upgraded to a villa suite (what a lovely treat for my husband's birthday!) and it was magnificent. The young woman on Reception (sorry I've forgotten her name) was SO helpful friendly and really did her best to please. She also arranged for a birthday cake to be left in our room. A lovely touch. The hotel and complex was very quiet which was what we wanted. My husband had a massage in the spa and said it was very enjoyable!  If I had to be critical then I would say the drinks are quite expensive (about £5 for a bottle of beer £4 for a Coke) and the food is very limited. The restaurant had about 4 main courses to choose from and it was quite expensive. We ate there once. The pool bar was a good menu again not a huge choice but they did club sandwich pizza etc which were very nice! This closes at 5pm though so we ate then instead of later in the restaurant. The breakfast was lovely all the usual pastries cereals fruits etc and also on the patio the chef cooked omelettes and potato cakes (no extra charge!)  All the staff were helpful polite and courteous. The reception staff particularly speak excellent English.  There is a movie room (about £7 each which includes popcorn) but we didn't visit that so can't comment. We were too busy enjoying our villa and private pool! 😆  We had a marvellous stay and it was exactly what we wanted!,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"King's Lynn, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/716Pinky

Ur at a hotel as if we were waiting for him to tell us about hotels!!! And he refused to make any discount as a compliment even.    Last thing is i lost almost 500 usd there didn't find them at all during my stay and i lost them in a day when i asked the house keeper not to do my room until they send a technician to fix the safe however an hour later i found my room done ""ps. all my money was inside that room outside the safe as it was not working!!""

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,David A wrote a review May 2016,30,A good 3.5 - 4 star hotel - great for pool dwellers.,We stayed at Tigmiza for two nights having spent 3 nights previously at Riad Idra in the Medina (highly recommended). To make something clear Tigmiza is a good hotel with a highly 'Instagrammble' pool areahowever it's 5 star aspirations let it down as the expectations that come with it are not met.    Let's start with the good points: Three great looking pools. These were not heated (May) and were too cool for some of the guests but provided a nice occasional cool-off from the 30 degree sun. If lounging by the pool is your thing you will struggle to find a more relaxing setting than Tigmiza.    Free shuttle service: The hotel runs regular shuttle runs to the Jma el Fna every day - which is great for escaping the hotel and discovering the real Marrakesh. I would have preferred leaving an hour earlier in the evenings though as once you reached the city you only have 2.5 hours to find your restauranteat and get back to the meeting point.    Now for the (hopefully) constructive observations bearing in mind that the hotel markets itself as 5 star.    Food: Being in a fairly remote location most guests rely on the hotel for food/drink. The daily menu is very limited and pretty poor by 5 star standards. An unimaginative selection i.e. spaghetti bolognese burger club sandwich etc. Food is simple and fairly bland. A few guests commented on this during the evening shuttle journeys. Breakfast is a varied - buffet style selection - which is probably the most reliable source of food at the hotel. The food is more akin to the typical 3 star chain hotels and this needs addressing.    Service: Whilst lounging at the pool a common gripe amongst a number of guests was how long it took to be served and how little (if ever) you were asked if you required anything. Most took to getting up and walking to order at the bar. At a 3/4 star hotel this wouldn't be such a gripe but service is what sets apart the good from the great hotels. Also the system of signing your room name and signature after each order is a pretty antiquated way of keeping the tab - how about just one at the end of the day - or giving your room number at the beginning?    The staff whilst all being professional did not give off much warmth as per previously experience in our Riad and other premium hotels throughout the world. On the whole we felt that most requests were a burdon.    The room: We stayed in the Pavillon Palmiers a large one bed private terrace apartment by the main pool. The bed was comfy and the linen was crisp however the feeling was that it was a little rough around the edges. The outdoor furniture was stained and indoor furnishings were a little scruffy. Compare this to the standard of furnishings in a number of the Riads we visited and it did not stack up. The white shag pile rugs were also in need of dry cleaning as they were full of dirt hair and other nasties. We also went the first 24 hours with one roll of toilet paper (cleaning team might remember finding packets of Kleenex in the bathroom!)    All of this made us less inclined to want to spend money at the hotel and as such took the shuttle service into the Medina on both nights and took an excursion on our final day (4x4 tours - very highly recommended - do not miss)    I could go on but having been truly fortunate enough to have stayed in a number of 5 star hotels across the globe instead I could just offer the following advice to travellers. If you manage your expectations and treat the getaway as 3/4 star - you should enjoy your stay. Like I said for lounging by the pool it ticks the boxes. If true luxury is what you're seeking go elsewhere.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidAlexanderV

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Rav2304 wrote a review May 2016,50,5* hotels do not get much better than this!!!,Right from the offset the hotel was very courteous and were in constant contact to arrange our airport transfer and any other requests we had made. Upon arrival we were warmly greeted by Tariq at the front of house who was extremely welcoming and explained everything to us in detail about the hotel and facilities. Also the fact that we were upgraded to a villa with a private pool! :)    The hotel was absolutely massive and had 2 public pools pool bar restaurant cinema (can be booked in advance). gym spa among other facilities. You could probably spend a few days just at the hotel! When shown to our room we were in absolute awe. The place was almost the size of a 2 bedroom house with a humongous lounge outside seating area connecting to private outdoor pool shower and toilet on ground floor. Upstairs there was a massive bedroom with king size bed (extremely comfortable) seperate shower and bath toilet and even an outside balcony overlooking the garden. The place was honestly beautiful and so spacious for the two of us.    Breakfast was fantastic with a great variety of food available from both hot and cold delicacies. Cereal toast pastries cheeses yoghurts fruit eggs (chef will cook to your preference) hams sausages and the usual juices and hot drinks (cappuccino was fantastic!). There were great choices for lunch and dinner available as we had to dine at the hotel one night because of some crazy traffic in Marrakech but the hotel food did not disappoint and was more than tasty and at a reasonable price. Room service was available 24hrs a day and charged at 50 dirhams for delivery.    The hotel had a great transfer service to the Medina (old town where you will find the souks and more traditional side of Marrakech). This was free of charge and left at 10am with a 1pm pick up and then again in the evening leaving at 7pm with a 10pm pickup. Remember you are roughly 15/20 minutes out from the main hustle and bustle of Marrakech so this is a great service to get around. If you decide to go at another time it costs 150 dirhams before 8pm and 225 dirhams after 8pm via the hotel service.    A quick note on the fact the hotel goes out of its way to make your stay special; it was the day before my birthday and we went out for dinner. Upon arriving back to our villa the hotel had very kindly spelt 'Happy Birthday' with flower petals on the bed and to top it off they sent a chocolate cake at 12am! Honestly i was really chuffed and cannot thank them enough for making our stay extra special and one we will never forget. Therefore a special thank you must go out to Tariq Lamya and Marouane for their friendly approach extremely helpful tips and overall level of customer service which made our stay so memorable. Thank you all and we hope to see you again one day!,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rav2304

This hotel has been the perfect backdrop for an almost retreat like stay far enough away from the hustle and bustle of the City but close enough for a taxi ride to all the action    The hotel is the perfect antithesis of grandure and cosiness. Our villa with a private garden and pool offers the ulimate luxury feeling whilst still managing to give you that homely experience.

He has a team of thoughtful friendly staff especially those at reception and in the dining area. The three hour cookery course was great fun. We learnt so much from Muhammed Aaminah and the team. We then had our tagine bread and aubergine salad by the pool. The only heated pool is within a courtyard in the building but is mostly in the shade of banana trees. If you want a city break from a distance but within easy reach this is perfect. We were upgraded to a villa on arrival which had a plunge pool (cold) and enjoyed the 1700hrs afternoon mint tea each day and also booked the private cinema.

Very relaxed and quiet not much around the hotel ands taxi needed to town hotel does though provide a bus twice a day.

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Puds24 wrote a review Mar 2016,50,An exceptional stay,I am writing this review on our private terrace alongside our private pool in one of the luxurious villas here at Tigmiza Suites. That in itself says something about the quality of the wifi across the whole site (which is better than I've previously experienced in two previous stays in Marrakech).    The first thing to say about this hotel is that it is in Marrakech which is fast becoming a favourite destination of ours - especially for a short winter break. February in London is cold wet and miserable and after just a three and half hour flight you arrive in North Africa into 22 degree sunshine (it feels a lot hotter lying directly in the sun). Add to that the vibrant culture of the souk delicious food great and friendly service and amazing value for money and its hard to look past this city for our now annual February break in the sun.    This is the fifth hotel we've stayed in in Morocco in three trips and all have been wonderful. The fact that the Tigmiza has an average rating of 5 and only manages to be the 74th best hotel in Marrakech tells you that this is a city full of wonderful venues and wonderfully welcoming staff. If you have never visited you absolutely have to.    On to the Tigmiza itself. So we've staying in some amazing places in Morocco over the last 18 months; this place tops them all.    The hotel is a sprawling collection of the main hotel (and suites) plus a number of huge villa each with their own outdoor spaces and private pool! The villas are spotless beautifully decorated and comfortable - the perfect places to relax and unwind if you want absolute privacy and quiet.    The main hotel is incredible and as there aren't that many guests there is always plenty of space on the loungers by the main pools.    Lunches can be had at the pool bar and food is tasty well prepared and comes in hearty portions. Alcohol is a little pricey but given that the food and accommodation is such great value this balances out pretty fairly.    Dinners are taken either in the Moroccan dining room or the main dining room. Tagines are prepared to authentic recipes but presented in a contemporary way and the food is excellent. There are some western options but you obviously need to make sure you sample all of the local food. The briouates and pastilla on the starters options are light and delicious and the best we've eaten in Morocco. The Moroccan salads starter is easily large enough for two - in fact all of the starters are big enough for two to share.    Post-dinner head to the bar decorated in an old-fashioned gentlemen's club style and furnished with large leather armchairs - a wonderful setting for a scotch or cocktail.    I almost forgot the spa! We had beldi scrubs in the hammam - an amazing and skin-purifying experience followed by relaxing massages. Highly recommended - especially the Hammam scrub which isn't something you can get at home.    The staff have have looked after us every minute we've been here. I cant emphasise enough how great they have been.    Our thanks to them for making this such a great stay Kelly and Naeem.

Firstly a big thank you to the staff for making our stay so memorable thank you for your kindness.  We were met with refreshing mint tea and pastries and then informed we had been upgraded from a beautiful suite to a luxurious and spacious villa with a private pool! It was amazing; it had flowers fruit bowl & a plate of nuts & a bottle of water waiting. How lucky were we? Our garden had flowers everywhere & it was so quiet & relaxing. We made a couple of forays into town (on the free shuttle run twice a day) but really could have spent all our time here quite happily. The breakfast choice is wonderful and we can recommend the spa for fabulous massages. We had a late flight home so spent the last day exploring the rest of the complex and lying by the main pool (there are three!) - what a treat to be able to do so without music blaring just the sound of the birds & the running water. Do try the chicken tagine with preserved lemons and olives at the restaurant simply delicious. So much to recommend - it was faultless.

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,JuliaCL36 wrote a review Feb 2016,50,Still dreaming,We visited Tigmiza as a couple from 8 - 12 Feb and are so pleased about out hotel choice. The staff was always helpful and went out of their way to cater to any requests and answered any questions we had. The room (We stayed in the Black & Gold Suite) is spacious clean and beautifully decorated. The bed was big and comfortable so much that getting up in the morning was a challenge :) Location wise you are slightly outside of the bustling chaos of the medina but the free shuttle provided by Tigmiza would get you to the city centre in 15 mins.    The only thing I would say is that the breakfast could be improved and the wifi sometimes acted up. Aside from that we were 100% pleased with our stay and would recommend Tigmiza to anyone.,Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuliaCL36
Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,S T wrote a review Feb 2016,50,"Comfortable, relaxing and 5 star.",Just spent a long weekend at Tigmiza and it was honestly one of the best breaks we have had. Comfortable beds and very spacious rooms (suites) really friendly and helpful staff always with a smile and very genuine. If something is wrong they fix it without a second thought and you feel really looked after. It's a way from the Medina but that suited us fine as we wanted total peace and quiet. There is no traffic or any other noise at this hotel and you wake to just the sound of birds. Really lovely indoor/outdoor pool that is heated (which you definitely need in February). Would advise you ask for tea/coffee to be provided in room (as it isn't as standard). Drinks are very expensive (as you'd probably expect) but food is reasonable and the breakfast is delicious. If you can I'd delay the arrival 'tour of the hotel' as we were exhausted when we arrived having travelled for 8 hours and just wanted to get to our room and not tour the whole hotel and grounds. Perhaps the tour can be delayed until guests have settled into their room which is all you want to do when you get there - then get outside to the pool! Would definitely visit again - for longer than a weekend.,Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Ripon, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SallyAT

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,BH12ANT wrote a review Dec 2015,50,Off the scale hotel - excellent service and rooms,Stayed at Tigmiza last week wasn't sure if it would be too far from centre but the hotel is the hidden gem of Marrakech. The staff were attentive and outstanding; nothing was too much trouble; with great recommendations for dinner/nights out and accommodating off the menu requests one evening where we had a delicious meal. The breakfast was awesome fresh made to order omelettes every morning along with a selection of morrocan pancakes pastries and fruits. The rooms are bespoke (we stayed in Chinoise) and if you have the cash their villas with own pool are a must. If you're looking for relaxation in a hotel which feels like home away from home with great service then look no further than Tigmiza. I will be going back to Kech and trying out another suite at Tigmiza. Top tip: It's worth hiring a car if you can face driving in the city as this makes getting into the city even easier though the hotel has a free daily shuttle.

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,markgallison wrote a review Dec 2015,50,Understated Luxury,"I'm writing this by the pool as I sadly prepare to depart back to the wind & rain of Scotland.    This is my 3rd visit to Marrakech and the Tigmiza has surpassed all my expectations (which were high to begin with)  The hotel is extremely quiet at the moment and it has felt like I was the only guest. A real luxury in itself.  Due to the recent problems in Paris I believe this has curtailed many French visitors plans hence the low occupancy however I hope they feel confident to return in the near future because this place really is a heavenly oasis. I felt completely safe & secure both within the hotel & in Marrakech itself.  The staff are attentive friendly without being in any way intrusive.    My suite (Black & Golf) is beautifully furnished with perhaps the comfiest bed I have ever slept on. Bliss.    The pool area's are magnificent with an abundance of classy comfortable loungers. It took me 3 days of being here before I realised there was another equally beautiful pool on the property.    Breakfast is abundant & delicious. I only had one evening meal on the night of my arrival which was traditionally Moroccan and tasty. However I opted to eat out every other evening and took advantage of the free taxi service each night at 7pm to explore the Medina (around 20 minutes away) and was collected each night around 10pm.    Although not ""cheap"" the hotel represents excellent value for money and already I'm planning to return in the spring. Thank you to Hamza the new general manager who took the time to show me a selection of suites to enable me to request my favourite when I return. Every suite is individually themed and all equally gorgeous. The Duplex Suite really does stand out tho and the individual villa's with private pool look beyond amazing if your budget extends to it.

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Steve D wrote a review Nov 2015,50,Really hard t fault this place,I am sitting in the inside bar writing this review so impressions are fresh and hopefully considered. The TripAdvisor comments in general about this establishment are fair - My disclosure is that I have run several tour operators to Morocco so am familiar with what there is on offer. I am no longer involved in selling holiday here only taking them and it is with this that I have gone with my other half for a 4-night break to Marrakech at the Tigmiza. The stand out feature of this establishment is the staff - you really get a sense that they try and please and really care if you are having a good time - Not always the case in Morocco. The hotel itself is really well designed the lowest class of room is a suite (where we stayed) and these are really roomy and comfortable well maintained and lots of nice little touches - basket of fruit on arrival bottle of chilled water. The decor is really imaginative with each suite having its own them - we are staying in the Art Deco suite ... which is themed faithfully with tasteful design paintings and furnishings. I haven't seen the villas however other guests tell me they are really nicely done. There are 3 pools (one gets heated after we have gone on the 15th November) and the pool area is very well attended by staff folding and delivering fresh towels every time you walk away from your sunbed. The public areas are good with wi-fi in most areas of the hotel. A free minibus will take you twice a day into the heart of the medina the air-conditioning was really welcome.    And then there is the spa ...... I normally trail dutifully behind my wife when we visit spas they usually leave me a little disappointed as if I am on a stage with someone going through the motions waiting for the whalesong to finish and the routine to end. Well I have found an exception - the massage (one of 3 available) was the best I have ever had by a mile - and the masseuse who treated my wife diagnosed and proposed treatment for a longstanding injury that nobody had ever managed to get near. All in all - a really exceptional experience (Thanks Souad).    If there are any shortcomings - The tables in the restaurant while unique and quirky (antiques) are great they are impractical as dining tables. Also the kitchen service is slow food is fine table service is great - it just seems to take a long time given a menyu that isn't expansive.    I am nit-picking here as it is reallhard to fault this place!    Although it is against my mantra i have a sneaky suspicion we will be back here,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevedA9635BB

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,MrHarper13 wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Best Week of My Life,My daughter turned One at the start of September. As this has been a very testing last 12 months for my wife and I. We became parents for the first time my mother passed away suddenly on Christmas day in my arms my sister in law passed away in April.    So when we booked this Holiday we wanted one thing a safe Hotel where we could celebrate my daughters first Birthday with good weather and be treated like a King and Queen for our stay.    We chose this Hotel as it had some good reviews was far enough from the chaos that is the main old city. We had a young baby with us. So we thought we should choose a nice hotel and travel into town when we need to. The pictures do not do this place justice...    There are three adult pools with a baby pool as well. the gardens take you into a magical kingdom! All types of tropical plants and flowers with stunning pools scattered about the place!    When we arrived the Hotel offered a complimentary pick up from the airport. The receptionist Hassan could see my wife and I were hot and bothered. So he instantly played with my daughter to and kept her entertained to allow my wife and I to enjoy a cold drink. Had a Birthday cake ready for my daughter.    The driver who picked us Younnes a tennis ball in his car which he gave to my daughter to play with while our bags were taken up to the room. Then much to our surprise had one the chaps working here deliver the ball to our room for her to continue to play with it.    The restaurant manager Abdel Hak who got to know my wife was 5 months pregnant during a brief chat. On the second day of our stay my wife had managed to catch a cold on the flight so when I came back from the Pharmacy to by some paracetamol came running over when he saw what I was carrying. Instantly offered to make my wife a medicinal drink. Which was greatly appreciated by my wife. (I would like to add the Hotel did not charge me for this emergency trip to the shops nothing was too much trouble)    Isam one of the waiters would play with my daughter to allow my wife and I an extra few moments to enjoy the breakfast in peace.    The other Receptionists Tarik and Mouaad went out of their to make sure we had excursions booked. Booking through the hotel is cheaper than booking from the UK i found (40% cheaper). They also made sure fresh fruit and baby milk were sent to our room when ever my wife and daughter wanted them.    My daughter (as most one year olds) make a mess when eating the hotel staff would smile and clean up after her. We as parents would try and clean up after her as we felt cleaning up after a baby would test the patience of saint. The told us to stop and cleaned up all her mess. This left us to swim eat drink and enjoy our daughter smile and laugh.    All the cleaners would stop and say hello to my daughter and would offer to hold her a moment to give my wife and I a few moments peace.    As all the staff would go out of their way to make sure ever one of our wishes were carried out to perfection. They all speak great english. They also taught me French. The food at the restaurant is of a very good standard. We were sad to leave we were made to feel like King Queen and Queen. This has to be the best value for money hotel I have ever stayed at!    Very sad to leave but will return next year with more family and children.

Finally managed to speak to someone after another two calls and i was advised the brunch doesn't exist anymore and that it is a pool pass for 15 euros and we pay the consumption.  The place looks nice on the website  the brunch offer is good compared to competition but it's a shame you have to struggle to get a reservation.,Date of stay: June 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Antibes, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travig00
Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Travelhappyalways wrote a review May 2015,50,Stunning boutique hotel,We stayed for 4 nights in early May. It was a last minute booking having seen other positive reviews and we were not disappointed. The property is beautiful - every room is individually decorated to a high standard and the public areas are all stunning and well kept. The pool area is peaceful. It is a very quiet and relaxing hotel with not much going on (probably suited to a 3 or 4 night stay) but this is just what we wanted. It is also lovely for couples as it is great for a romantic break. It is a way out of the centre of Marrakech so it you are planning to be in the town all the time then this may not be the hotel for you as you will be travelling to and fro quite a bit However the hotel does run a good free shuttle bus service and the taxis are not too expensive. Book your airport transfer through the hotel as it is cheaper than just picking up a taxi when you arrive. The hotel is located in an exclusive part of Marrakech and it does look and feel like you are in an oasis. The roof terrace is beautiful for a drink and a meal in the evening. It is not cheap but then you are paying for your surroundings and a high standard of service.  The only negative we could make is that there is no literature in the room/public areas about the hotel times of meals shuttle bus and all the usual information. We were told some of this when we arrived but it is easily forgotten. It would also have been helpful to have some information provided about Marrakech. When we asked Reception about tours they could only show us something on the PC on the Reception desk. We are reasonably self sufficient so got a bit fed up keep having to ask questions.,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Kenilworth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelhappyalways

The property is gorgeous and perfectly maintained it is truly relaxing great amenities (check out the movie theater) - but the best thing about the hotel is the service. Our manager Mouad was simply outstanding and not only gave us an upgrade to one of the beautiful villas with private pool but so much good advice on where to go. Outstanding service so personal and warm - like everyone else has said here this is really what distinguishes this hotel from the other beautiful properties.

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Baywatch2014 wrote a review Apr 2015,50,A great resort for family holidays,A family outing for three generations from 70+ down to 5. The villas are excellent for this type of holiday and there was non-stop use of our villa plunge pool by both our grandchildren and their various new-found friends also staying at the resort. The enclosed resort provides a safe environment for the young to enjoy themselves and is peaceful and relaxing for the older crowd. The staff are helpful and friendly. The hotel runs a complimentary taxi service to central Marrakech in the morning and evening. At other times the hotel can organise transport either into Marrakech or for other expeditions. The children used the cinema twice complete with popcorn. I recommend this resort.,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Baywatch2014
Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,77Abigail wrote a review Apr 2015,40,Overall nice Hotel choice for the family,Stayed here with my family - 3 young children - in one of the very nice villas with pool. The villa size was ideal and the fact that it came with a nice size bed for the boys was a huge plus. Not too crazy about the stairs to the Bedroom as I have a little one but we just had to be extra cautious. The private pool was exactly what we wanted and needed - privacy and proximity. It couldn't have been more ideal. Yes it is more expensive but worth it.  Room service was very prompt. The main restaurant could use a bit more variety with their selections as we were probably ordering the same thing every day. Same for breakfast. Although it was not a lot of choices offered for breakfast at least it was well prepared.  Shuttle to town/market was very nice and reliable. It's about a 20 min drive.    Disappointments: The movie theater selections offered in my opinion were not appropriate for young kids thus we were not able to take advantage of this amenity.  For the airport transfer We specifically requested a car seat for our 2 year old and hotel confirmed our request but did not provide one. We were very disappointed. Also we requested a baby cot and we did get one but it was broken. They put it together in the room with linens but I chuckle at the fact that they knowingly provided me with a visibly broken cot. I had to improvise.  For the price we paid on a per night basis $$$$ these last two requests should have been met at the very least from a safety perspective.,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Katy, Texas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/77Abigail
Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,DIJ58 wrote a review Apr 2015,50,Just perfect!,Not often I say it but really could not find fault with this hotel. A welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech. The hotel provides a shuttle service into the centre of the town but if the times don't suit then taxis are not expensive although we did agree a price before getting in! The hotel staff were amazing. So friendly and accommodating. The pool area was delightful our room was stunning and very quiet despite being at the heart of the hotel. A unique feature is the private cinema. Definitely worth taking advantage of.

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Anjones13 wrote a review Apr 2015,30,Definitely NOT five stars,After reading the reviews on trip advisor we were very excited to be spending three nights here. There is no doubt that the grounds and pool are beautiful; an oasis outside the city centre. However we found little else to credit this hotel with five stars. Breakfast was awful - pastries hard cold pancakes limited fruit and poor service. The food on the whole was very limited with five lunch options that never changed. Room service on out first night took an hour to arrive and was cold. The following day our room was still not cleaned until I complained to reception at 4pm. The room was spacious but with scuffed walls and only four hangers to hang our clothes. The service was haphazard and frustrating - they booked the wrong time for our taxi informed us there was no melon 40 minutes after taking the order. I could go on. Ultimately this is a nice hotel but lacks the quality of service food and facilities to make it five stars.,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anjones13

It was one if not THE best hotel experiences we have ever had. The rooms are beautifully decorated (we stayed in the Palmiere Pavillon) The pools and the grounds are beautiful. The roof terrace was so relaxing to sit and have a glass of wine at sunset it truly felt magical. We also had a massage in the Spa which was great too. The hotel is pure 5 star luxury with lots on offer. The staff are so polite and helpful nothing is too much trouble. The service was first class. The hotel is about 10 minutes drive from the Medina but the hotel offer a free shuttle twice daily which we took advantage of however it was nice to get out of the hustle and bustle and relax by the peaceful pool after a morning at the Souks. There is also a little childrens play area at the far side of the hotel which is great to entertain little ones.

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Donald F wrote a review Jan 2015,30,Beautiful hotel but inconsistent service,We stayed four nights recently for New Year. It is a beautiful hotel serene atmospheric and relaxing with extremely friendly and caring staff. The grounds are pleasant and well maintained. Breakfasts modest but absolutely fine as were the evening meals.    However the service at times was bordering on sheer chaos. Whilst we are in no way excessively fussy insensitive or demanding travellers for the high price one pays to stay here customers should expect a much higher and more consistent level of service.    There were so many little incidents but in total they all accumulated to become annoying. For example we called reception a number of times to ask for something but then ended up waiting and waiting thereby necessitating a further call before action was eventually taken; insufficient electric conversion plugs or as advised someone to make up the fire or laundry not returned on time or for that matter properly cleaned or three different prices being charged on consecutive days for the same drinks at the hotel bar or no restocking of mini bar or daily replenishment of bottled water in the room. On the final night when we wanted to order room service there was no room service menu in the room necessitating admittedly a brief walk to the hotel to order and where I ironically discovered the bar prices in a menu by sheer chance!    It is such a shame as the hotel itself and the staff are very friendly but the hotel is badly let down by the seeming lack of normal hotel management best practice. When we asked to speak to the manager 48 hours before we left he did not materialise although an email was sent to us 7 days after we had left the hotel! I think that sums up the hotel's senior management remote with an insufficient customer focus.,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonaldF453

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,linda p wrote a review Jan 2015,40,Good but could be better,We booked this property after reading such great reviews on Trip Advisor. Our stay was over the New Year Period and I do have to agree with the most recent reviews added over this period. Even though we enjoyed our stay overall Tigmiza doesnt quite live up to the standard that the price should justify.  There are many good points however the little bad experiences collectively sour our overall impression.  On the plus side:  The suites are very comfortable and clean the bed and shower being one of the best we have experienced worldwide.  Even though the breakfast is basic we still enjoyed it especially the fresh juices.  The majority of the staff are exceptionally friendly and willing to help even though they are visibly overstretched and overworked.  The Morrocan theme dinner on Tuesday and Friday is highly recommended very enjoyable and reasonably priced.    The points that we found undesirable could easily be corrected by the management which is the only reason we mention them here:    The outdoor pool is claimed to be heated but is still freezing. We would have enjoyed our stay more had we been able to use this in comfort.    We booked Tigmiza on the basis that it has a spa. However you are charged for even using the steam room and sauna without any treatment. I feel that this is a small inclusion that the owners could make complimentary as the prices charged per room should allow this at least.    Everything in the hotel is very expensive and extremely overpriced by any standards.  A simple bottle of water is 35Dirham and as the premises are so isolated you have little choice but to accept. Again the management could offer a courtesy bottle of water in the room daily with no real cost to themselves.    We were given vouchers for the New Years Eve dinner at €250 which we didnt book. Like the other guests the reception refused to take no for an answer. This isnt very comfortable customer relations.  Then we were offered to partake in a Buffet lunch on New Years Day which was delicious. Until we were presented with a bill of 600Dirham. No mention of the cost before this.  We couldnt escape the feeling that these guys would charge you for breathing if they could and always made us feel that our wallets were more important than hospitality.    And of course our bill was wrong when we checked out and after reception adding up 3times with 3different results we were in a hurry to catch our plane. My advice is to pay for things as you use them to save any confusion.    Overall a comfortable peaceful place to enjoy Morocco but we wont be coming back to this premises.,Date of stay: December 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindapX8902LM
Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Nick M wrote a review Jan 2015,40,Lovely family run hotel: but with some lessons to learn...,"Tigmiza is a hotel of paradoxes.    It's a family run hotel which is reflected in the affable and extremely helpful staff throughout the hotel. This is definitely not a ""corporate"" five star offering - if you have ever travelled on business and visited the miscellany of surly hotels across the globe you will know what I mean.... It's the people that make this hotel a place worth staying - the surroundings are pretty much what you would expect (for the money you pay). Beds are great. Rooms are spacious. There are a couple of nice pools. And there are plenty of palm trees.    Okay. That's the good stuff.    On the downside.... oh my god do they need a food and beverage manager with international experience. The staff are wonderful kind hearted and would do anything for you.... but they need far far better leadership and training. I suspect the management team is fairly inexperienced and this is reflected in the minutiae of service. For an expensive five star hotel the management team need to do much more work to get some of the basics right (e.g.. white wine goes into the smaller glass and red wine in the big). The service and organisation at the New Years Eve ball was bordering on Fawlty Towers. The dinner came with a price tag of 280 euros per head and yet we didn't get served with our main course until 1135pm. We had a wonderful invitation to join the hotel for a New Years Day buffet by the poolside - unfortunately the invitation omitted to let us know that this would be at a cost of £25 per head. The hotel receptionists were really lovely and would do anything for you but would always prioritise a ringing phone over people waiting at the desk for service. It doesn't sound much... but this is a pretty expensive hotel and the lack of training and leadership really does show.    The hotel's restaurant is okay and serves nice food - if a little unadventurous. The lunch time poolside menu is probably as good (if not better) than the restaurant's evening menu. In the evening it would be good if they could turn the lights down and put candles on the tables - and even better if they could build a slightly more expansive menu. On more than one occasion we had to send food back because it either wasn't cooked properly or was cold (very rarely were we served with heated plates).    If this sounds a little bit picky it's because this is (comparatively) an expensive five star hotel and if it's going to survive long term it needs to pay more attention to training and detail.    On the practical side the hotel is a 30 minute cab ride from central Marrakesh. The hotel runs a free twice daily transfer service (10am returning at 1pm and 7pm returning at 10pm) into the centre of the Medina. If you want to go under your own steam the return journey will cost about £25.00.    Overall this was a very relaxing five days and the staff are genuinely lovely people. Relative to the region this is an expensive place to stay and the management needs to bring in some more experienced five star leadership. If they do that then this hotel has the potential to be truly world class.",Date of stay: December 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Norwich, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/863nickm
Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Tonythepony wrote a review Jan 2015,40,Beautiful hotel with some small drawbacks,We stayed at the Tigmiza hotel over new year and thoroughly enjoyed our week there. We were upgraded to a terrific pool villa (having booked the pavilion)...and this was a spectacular bonus with our own pool lovely garden and downstairs room for our son. The staff are all very friendly and nothing is any trouble. In the interests of balance I think it is right to point out three negatives...1- the location is about 25 mins away from the centre of Marrakesh and while 2 free shuttle buses are provided each day it does become a bit of a pain getting to and from the hub (and not cheap if you book taxis to get to restaurants in the evening)...2-restaurant lacks atmosphere and drinks are grossly overpriced....because of the small nature of the hotel the restaurant is quiet and the menu limited plus drinks in the bar/room service are far too expensive by any standards...3- wifi unreliable/patchy...if you need or rely on wifi for work this will drive you mad (in pool villa 8 there was no wifi at all).....overall however these are fairly minor points and the hotel is extremely good...well worth a stay if you want an idyllic retreat away from the medina,Date of stay: December 2014,,"Walton-On-Thames, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tonythepony
Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,AlsterHamburg wrote a review Jan 2015,10,5 star Nightmare,The hotel is located about 15 km away from the city center of Marrakech. The ride by car will take about 15-20 minutes. In the neighborhood you will find nothing except a few palms. Without a car you will feel helpless. Without having a precise description of the route or without a guide you will not find this location.  From a 5 Star hotel I expect to see a doorman or porter infront of the entrance. But there was nobody! You need to carry your baggage or luggage out of the car into the hotel.  Check In:  There was only one lady behind the desk. At first she wanted to get a deposit from my credit card of 27000 MAD (Dirham) = about 2700 € for a Stay of 6 days. I have rejected this wish because the whole amount for the complete stay is about 2850 € and I already needed to prepay 560 €. So I only needed to pay another 2300 €. Then the answer of this lady was that the amount of the deposit should be for more possible expenses in the hotel. Then she reduced this deposit from 27000 MAD down to 13000 MAD. Then she has handed over vouchers for the dinner at New Years Eve. Then I have informed her that we will not take this dinner because we have already booked it in a different restaurant. Then she presented me the booking showing that I have done the booking including the dinner. But I was able to present her my booking confirmation where I have only done my booking for a Pavillon wih breakfast. Then she wanted to discuss the cancellation of the booking for the menue next Day with her manager which I also have rejected because I have not done this booking.  Then she has accepted it. Including filling in the registration form the process for the check in took 40 minutes! ! Then we have got an upgrade to Villa nr.6. Then we moved on an entered the villa. Of course nobody has shown us each room facilities and functions of AC or TV. After checking the villa we found bugs and garbish in the bathtub. The rooms floors and carpets were dirty and not cleaned before. The Villa has a ground floor and a first floor. Of course there is an aircondition. But what a big surprise: The AC for the ground floor is not working! Even after 12 hours and setting the System to 30 °C the estimated temperature has reached about 10°C. This is unacceptable in the winter period when the night temperatures outside will only reach about 6°C. And opposite in summer it will be hot in the room because the AC is not working correct. So we have called the reception to clean the rooms and the next day we wanted to care about the AC and the temperature. The pool which belongs to a villa is not heated. This means that you cannot use it in winter times. Of course there is no AC or heating in the TOILET or BATHROOM.  Maybe it make sense to say that this hotel has charged 480 € for a Pavillon only including a shower. This means that the price for a villa is higher.  Next morning we went to have our breakfast. There were 9 tables in the room. Nobody of the waiters have greeted us. Nobody has asked us for our wishes. So we have asked them to get our coffee and Cappuccino. Then the Cappuccino has arrived and was presented with a totally wet saucer and it was send back to dry the saucer. Then it came again with the Information :Here is your hot chocolate. We said no we have ordered a Cappuccino. Then the waiter answered then it is your Cappucino. There was only one sort of cold cut: sausages. But they also have offered small quarters of 2 sorts of cheese. What a pity that it was finished and nobody of the staff has cared a to bring more. The cheese was decorated with raisins. 4 days there was only one sort of Toast  bread with mixed grains available. One day the toast bread was already toasted in advance. 4 days there was only one sort of rolls (bread) available. All bread was dry. Glasses sometimes were not available. After 4 days we have received Paperback serviettes. After 5 days we have had 2 sorts of rolls. The new sort was hard like a stone. I was unable to eat it. After 5 days there was only 1 sort of fresh fruit available: oranges.  After spending one night in our villa we have informed the reception to repair the AC. 12 hours later we were able to see the result of their works. Instead of repairing it they have put 1 fan into the room which should be able to heat 25 sqm. So we have asked the reception to given us a new villa. First it was confirmed. Then we have got the information that there was only a Pavillon available. So we went to this Pavillon. Of course the rooms were also not warm enough.But then we have seen the primitive shower and we have rejected the Pavillon. Then they suddenly were able to offer us a different Villa nr.13. We have accepted it and saw that the Villas have a different interior design. In general the furniture is cheap and not exclusive.  All bathtubs have plenty of rusty pimples inside. So you will feel like a Fakir from India who can sit on nails.  Mineralwater will only be presented (small Bottles with a price of 35 MAD) at the first day. A mention mostly will not be replaced. To Welt were taken away but not replaced. When we have informed the reception it took 2 reminders that they took actions.  Check Out: Of course the invoice was incorrect. The hotel put a lower room rate into the invoice. They have forgotten to calculate the prepaid amount which they have received. Then we were told that the hotel has not received the money. It should be the commission which we had to pay for the agency. Of course this was not correct. This proceso of check out needed 45 minutes. And Then it still was not a correct looking invoice.

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,SaadMughal M wrote a review Dec 2014,50,World Class,I've been all around the world this year for work and stayed in hotels that Presidents stay at and I can say Tigmiza has been the best yet.    This was a holiday visit with my Mother and Sister and on arrival we were greeted at the drive by a charming young lady from the front-desk by the name of Lamia. We were welcomed with Moroccan tea and pastries and given a tour of the beautiful hotel with a warm smile by Lamia and presented to the facilities and resources she had on planning our time in Morocco. The premises was immaculate and always being well looked after by a very welcoming housekeeping team. We also dined at the hotel on a few occasions and it was a pleasure to be served by such a hospitable waiting team.    The hotel is located outside the city so great if you want to relax whilst still be able to explore the vibrant old city and surrounding attractions. There is a shuttle bus the provides a complimentary pick and drop service to the centre of town twice a day and if you're looking for a short walk-about then the hotel gardens are a treat. We also visited the mountains for a hike to the waterfalls and took a hot air balloon trip. The hotel also has a heated outdoor pool and plenty of places to unwind.    We were also fortunate enough to be assisted by another outstanding member of the front-desk team Souad. Regardless of the time of day she was always bright-eyed and ready to help to make sure our visit was seamless. Note to Management - The front desk staff is one of the most valluable asset to the hotel.    Morocco was a lovely country with embracing locals I'd be delighted to visit again in future and of course I would be staying at Tigmiza. It would also be my pleasure to be used as a customer reference if ever required by any staff members that I met at the hotel.,Date of stay: December 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Eastbourne, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saadmughalm

Much better for kids too as the hotel has a small playground and lots of space for them to run around. The service was phenomenal and they could not do enough to make your stay comfortable. One of the bell boys literally ran to help me with a bag!    The food was very good and the rooms were clean well designed and spacious.

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,IrishJLondon wrote a review Nov 2014,50,"Relaxed luxury, great service, impeccable decor",We recently returned from a three night stay in Tigmiza and would highly recommend it. From the fresh fruit juice and Moroccan pastries on arrival to the private cinema with free popcorn we were so well looked after from start to finish. The hotel is around 20 minutes from Marrakesh city centre in a very quiet area with views of the Atlas moutains but not too remote from the action. There's also a free and convenient twice daily shuttle to the main square (10am returning 1pm 7pm returning 10pm). We ventured into the city centre twice once to look at the souks and another time to have dinner but mainly stayed in the hotel as the facilities were so good: clean beautifully decorated attentive staff heated pool and tasty food. The hotel is quite quiet at night so probably not the best choice if you want a lively holiday but ideal if you're after some rest and relaxation. We stayed in a villa with its own plunge pool - highly recommended if your budget can stretch to it but standard suites also looked great.,Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IrishJLondon
Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Christina Thomas wrote a review Nov 2014,50,Fabulous Resort in the Palmeraire!!,My friend and I chose Tigmiza for our Marrakech approach stop before diving into the Medina bustle.    We booked a villa that was so incredible! Our own little slice of heaven and privacy with pool (apparently #7 has a heated one so try for it! surprisingly the pools in all of Morocco are FREEEZING!) 2 bathrooms terraces and a super cool little nook in the living area.    I loved the bathtub upstairs and took advantage of it (and the warm water!).    The food is great. The restaurant was quiet when we were there which was fine and they have room service which is great.    The hammam and spa services were lovely. I had a massage and hammam that I thoroughly enjoyed.    My favorite experience was their screening room! They offer you a list of movies they have and you can choose which you'd like to watch. The space is filled with comfy chairs and ottomans they give you popcorn and my friend and I got a private show (i think it was slow season)! Super fun.    They also have matching capes for each room that my friend and I wore to keep cozy at the movies ; )    The service was great attentive staff gorgeous fruit trees everywhere and overall a great experience!

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Bookert45 wrote a review Nov 2014,50,A piece of paradise!,We were tempted by Tigmiza as it appeared much better value for a luxury resort in the Palmeraie area than many of the other options. We could not have been more pleased with our choice!    From the moment we arrived our experience at Tigmiza was just perfect. The front-desk staff were very welcoming and this quality of service continued throughout our stay whether we were at the pool bar or restaurant.    We had chosen to stay in a Pavilion and it was a great choice. They are very large with a lounge bedroom bathroom separate toilet and outside patio with sofas & tables. Although they don't have a private pool like the Pool Villas we much preferred using the beautiful and spacious main pool which is located just a few metres from the Pavilions.    The hotel appeared to have a fairly low occupancy during our stay which we thought was a plus as it made for a very peaceful stay. One downside was the roof-top bar wasn't open but we were more than happy with the snug English Bar.    A very generous and good quality breakfast is offered. We were staying for two nights and had intended to eat in the hotel on the 1st night and go into the centre of Marrakech on the 2nd. However having had such a delicious meal on 1st night we also ate there again on 2nd.    The grounds of the hotel are beautiful and are great for a stroll. If you're from UK it's not often you see pomegranates growing!    In summary if you want a luxurious stay in an oasis of calm I cannot recommend this enough.

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Nu189 wrote a review Oct 2014,40,Lovely hotel,We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. Its is about 15/20 minutes from the old town but there is a shuttle at 10am that collects at 1pm and another in the evening at 7pm with collection at 10pm. Our room was very clean and had beautiful decor. The grounds and pool are are also lovely. However at times we did find the hotel very quiet (at one point we were the only people in the restaurant for dinner). The only other issue we had was that on our final night there was a very loud group of people in the lobby area and as our room wasn't far from there we were disturbed by the noise. As this was at 1am/2am in the morning we feel the hotel staff should have asked the group to be considerate to other guests.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nu189

Majority of staff could not do enough for you and the cleaning staff were very diligent and would usually attend to the rooms twice daily.  The rooms were brilliant we stayed in ""le noir et or"" which is the black and gold room. I could not fault the room it was absolute luxury so would recommend this room to anybody and you will not be dissappointed. We asked to have a look at the villas which boast there own pool they were big but I personally found they were not as well decorated and lacked that luxury feel. I also found the garden/pool areas around the villas were not as well looked after compared to the rest of the hotel they looked slightly ""scruffy"" therefore we decided not to spend the extra money and stayed in our  gorgeous room. To be honest you have the public pool mostly to yourself anyway so it was like having your own private pool.  In conclusion anyone who stays here will be in awe and love the experience.

Stayed in two lovely suites either side of an enforced move out whilst the whole hotel was taken over for a wedding. The hotel did everything it could to mitigate the effect of the move including sending us to the excellent Taj Palace Hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful which may have been assisted by the under occupied hotel when we were there but I believe that the good service would have been there in any event. Beds and bedding were very comfortable. Meals were OK but not exceptional. The pool and gardens were beautiful and very well maintained. The hotel provides a free shuttle bus twice a day into central Marrakech about 25 mins away. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who would like some comfort and relaxation in beautiful surroundings with the ability to travel into central Marrakech.,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"St. Albans, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bostonian49
Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Nikkie wrote a review Sep 2014,50,Really amazing hotel,We had a fantastic stay at Tigmiza. The hotel is spotless staff are wonderful always happy to assist with anything. It was a lovely touch arriving and then receiving fresh juice and cake. The hotel has a wonderful calm feeling about it. The decor is really lovely. Breakfasts were a really large choice of great food. Omelettes were cooked fresh for you. The location is out of town in a quiet area. The hotel offers a shuttle to take you into town at 10 then back at 13.00 then again in the evening out at 19.00 back at 22.00. But if you need any longer it's only a short taxi ride. I loved staying out of the hustle and bustle of the town. Coming back to the calm and beautifully smelling hotel felt wonderful. Fresh flowers in room and at the tables. I cannot recommend this hotel enough every member of staff we met were friendly and happy. We stayed in a villa which was huge had it's own private pool and out of this world. I will defiantly go back next year. We were only there for 3 nights. There was so much I didn't get to enjoy The cinema (free you just choose a movie)  the spa looked wonderful they had a good choice of treatments and was priced right. The roof Terrace was so pretty with views of the Atlas Mountains. I wanted to watch the sun set from there as I'm sure it would be so beautiful. It's a perfect getaway with no time difference and only just over a 3 hour flight! There was nothing to fault this hotel with!!! Cannot wait to return!

Once we arrived the receptionist welcomed us with a smile and moroccan tea everything was taken care of our luggages were already in our room and refreshments in that same room.  Our stay was almost as fabulous as the arrival you can choose to use one of the 2 available swimming pools one right under then sunlight and the other one  covered with the shadows of the banana trees.    The Moroccan food served in the restaurant is marvelous the cook is perfect!    The only black spot is the breakfast...

When we arrived we were given Moroccan tea and cakes which was a lovely welcome the decor of the hotel is just stunning throughout we were in awe of the place when we arrived. We were shown to our room which was very nice but I had seen a couple for rooms I particularly liked online and asked if we could have one of these rooms one was available so we were moved swiftly into the next room which was STUNNING (Black and Gold room). All the staff were so friendly and helpful.    We ate breakfast every morning outside in the courtyard and it was delicious! Could not fault the food and they even had english breakfast tea! We had dinner at the hotel two nights and lunch one day and this food was also of a very high standard every time.    We got the shuttle bus into Marrakesh everyday either in the morning (left at 10am) or in the evening (7pm) and this was a great service. It meant we could easily explore Marrakesh whilst staying a 15 minute drive outside the city centre away from the hustle and bustle. Also afternoon tea and cakes were served everyday at 5pm which was always happily welcomed by us.    We booked a quad biking experience through the hotel which they happily helped with and arranged for us a very fun morning!    The rooftop area was very beautiful but also very quiet! We went up to the rooftop area a couple of times when we got back from dinner hoping to have some cocktails/drinks before heading back to our room but although there was a bar up there there was never anyone around (guests or staff!) so we found this a little strange.

Spent some time in the city and this was a nice change for a couple of days to relax after a horse riding trip. The staff were fantastic very professional and know how to look after their guests. The suite was lovely and your privacy is well respected. When we had a later flight the staff even moved us to a bigger suite for the day where we had a private pool for no extra cost. The whole restaurant has a very relaxing feel. Breakfast on the terrace was also attentive. The restaurant sells modern european food as well as Moroccan which is ok but a little overpriced and unfortunately was not quite up to the standard of the rest of the hotel (but is what I expect form an in house restaurant).

That really ought to be fixed because it was the only thing that marred our stay in any way.    A note about the hotel location... it's a bit away from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech.

All the staff is extremely helpful and we experienced an extremely high service from Saig (bar man) Amine and Racha.    The Cinema was a great experience for the children - remember your own dvd’s if your children are not English or French speaking.    The shuttle bus to the city centre of Marrakech works very well and we took a taxi once from the city centre which was 150 MAD – We did not negotiate a lot.    A few good advices from us to the resort would be:    The heated pool (28 dg) should be a few degrees warmer we had to take the kids out of the pool after 10 to 20 minutes because they were cold. (Same for the private pools 20 dg)    The selection of food in the restaurants could be a bit bigger especially because we were in the resort for a week. Further it would be nice to be told which possibilities we had for breakfast the first day.

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Jennifer D wrote a review Sep 2013,40,"Fantastic suites, but otherwise quite expensive!",We stayed in the Noire & Or suite which was fantastic - large and with a wonderful bathroom. The hotel setting was lovely and we spent some very relaxing days by the pool!  Breakfast was good but other than asking if we wanted tea/coffee or an omelette there was not choice!  We ate in the hotel the first night after a busy day the quality was good but the portion size was small choice limited and it seemed very expensive!  Take the shuttle bus which runs twice daily:  1000 - 1300  1900 - 2200  Into the main square and eat there nobody else seemed to use this facility??  We asked the hotel to arrange some taxis and it seemed a bit of a rip off £25 ish for a short return journey to a local supermarket?  Also check your bill I'm sure ours was a genuine error but there were some spa and mini bar charges that we didn't have.

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Fraser R wrote a review Aug 2013,50,The best of both worlds,A fantastic hotel. We stayed at Tigmiza during the second week of July and were extremely impressed. It is built to an very high standard indeed and the staff are extremely courteous and willing to assist.    The suite rooms were impeccably decorated clean and well presented with a good sized mezzanine sitting area and a lovely bedroom. The design of the hotel is its greatest selling point the courtyard pool is beautiful secluded and cool and views from different seating areas are nicely framed.    It is the perfect place to base yourself from if you want to balance the craziness of Marrakech with somewhere secluded and calm to escape to. There are shuttle buses in the morning and evening (10am drop off 1pm pick-up and 7pm drop off 10pm pick up) and the journey is around 15/20 mins. It would be good for Tigmiza to extend these times or offer a third mid-afternoon shuttle service as well particularly as the drop off point is a good 25 minute walk to the centre of the city so it can feel a little rushed getting back in time.    It may have been because we were visiting Marrakech during the off-season (the July heat can be just a few degrees too hot for comfort) but the most noticeable thing about the hotel (as others have commented) is how few people are staying there at any given moment and how sparsely distributed they are. We were the only ones staying in any of the ten suites with a few other couples staying in villas or pavilions. This can make it feel slightly like a ghost hotel some of the time as you are unlikely to run into other guests anywhere except the pool. It almost feels as if the hotel was built to be larger than it needed to be. Hopefully through word of mouth it is able to attract more and more guests as it is clearly set up to accommodate them and deserves a good sized client base. At the moment it can lack a little atmosphere particularly in the evenings after returning from the city.    Overall and despite the need for a couple of tweaks here and there it is hard to think of a better place to spend a few days in Marrakech and we would thoroughly recommend it.,Date of stay: July 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fraserr886
Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,FRANCOIS A A wrote a review Jul 2013,50,Oasis in Marrakech !,We had a wonderful few days at Tigmiza.    The experience from beginning to end was absolutely phenomenal. They serve excellent Moroccan pastries and mint tea at your arrival and then again at every tea time. It is exactly like its representation in photos: romantic relaxing…. All rooms are well described in internet so that everyone can choose what is best for them. We stayed at one of the Villas with a beautiful intimate covered terrace overlooking a small garden and a private swimming pool .    attention to details and personalized service is what's in everyone's mind at Tigmiza a splendid hotel in the unique Palmeraie and the magic of Marrakech    The spa and treatments we had were lovely could have gone every day had funds permitted.

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,amit_puri24 wrote a review Jul 2013,40,The potential to be great!,We booked a 4 night stay at Tigmiza recently and we were pleased in general. The majority of my review will be negative but Tigmiza can improve in all of the areas below and very easily at that. Hence the 'Very Good' rating.    Check-in was nice as we were warmly greeted on arrival and served with tea and snacks. However when asked about tours and places to visit the reception person was unhelpful. We had many questions to ask but did not get the answers we expected but this was mainly due to the language barrier. The staff always try to help but seem inexperienced. We did not allow this to deter us from taking in the spectacular surroundings. The whole place is amazing! There is some maintenance required here an there but nothing major.    We stayed in Villa 2 and it was almost perfect. I say almost as the 'private' pool area was not as private as we expected. The perimeter of the pool/garden area was only covered by some foliage and plant screens. On the day we arrived I had to ask for more coverage/privacy and so they got a couple more plant screens which helped but still not the 'privacy' we expected. We didn't allow this to spoil our holiday and so we made the most of our Villa. We spent the majority of our trip in our Pool Villa as planned.    The surroundings of our Villa were also not as expected due to work being carried out on neighbouring Villas and workers walking around the pool area every so often so our relaxing time was occasionally disturbed. We did not complain about this as it may have caused a bad atmosphere between us and the staff and we did just wanted a nice holiday. I'm hoping Tigmiza will learn from all of the reviews on Tripadvisor.    Unfortunately trying to explain something would become frustrating such as when we wanted room service or housekeeping. We made every effort to speak some French but this only helped on a couple of occasions. The lack of telephone manner became apparent also when staff struggled to understand English a simple hello or similar greeting was inexistent for a couple of staff. What we did not understand was why staff who did not speak English well did not just pass the phone to someone who spoke better English? Trying to explain that we would like an iron and ironing board was not a simple request.    On the last day we had read in the room directory that there was a daily complimentary tea-time gourmet break but we were not informed of this. We would have loved to have known about this. I was then curious to find out if we had missed out on anything else and so I checked other reviews on Tripadvisor and the Tigmiza website. We found a deal regarding complimentary spa treatment when booking 3 nights at Tigmiza. Having had a massage prior to this knowledge I would not have booked the massage as we would have had other complimentary spa treatment. Why spend money unnecessarily? Anyway I mentioned this deal on the check-out the following morning and I was told that the offer is only provided if booking online and not via an agency. We were unhappy with this reason considering this info was not mentioned online (althought it may be now) or why considering we have spent so much money we did not receive anything complimentary other than the usual shampoo etc. Tigmiza should really take note as some rivals offer more. Even a bottle of water a day would have been nice.    I really hope Tigmiza take note of my review as well as other reviews. They have the potential to be great!,Date of stay: July 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amit_puri24

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Travelalot2000 wrote a review Jun 2013,40,A Great Propety But Lacked Atmosphere,We spent three nights at Tigmiza Suites and Pavilions in mid June. We arrived late at night via the hotel arranged transfer and were greeted with fresh orange juice. Our room was large with a huge bath separate shower and a very comfortable King sized bed.    The property is constructed to a very high standard and in addition to the individually styled suites in the main building there are larger apartments with small private pools and. There is a large pool surrounded by gardens and a smaller pool which we understand can be heated in cooler months. Given the high standard of the buildings we were surprised at the number of small native plants (weeds?) growing between the paving stones around the pool. Was this a Moroccan feature or just poor maintenance?    There is a Spa in the complex as well as a cinema which can be hired for private viewings. We each had a massage in the spa which was very good.    Breakfast was served either in the restaurant or on a small patio. It was a very good continental breakfast with fresh fruit toast pastries more of the wonderful orange juice and yogurt.  The hotel operates a shuttle to the Medina twice a day but the drop off/pick up point is about a 20 minute walk to the main square from which one can enter the souks. The hotel is about a 20 minute drive to the medina which is just a little too far to be convenient.    We ate dinner once at the hotel and the food and service were good.    There was however one factor which was so notable during our stay. The hotel was deserted. We saw one other couple and aside from a few staff we saw no one else. This meant that there was no atmosphere with empty restaurants and no one in the lobby or around the pool. If you wanted to relax in luxurious surroundings and enjoy the quiet life then Tigmiza has much to offer. But you could do that at home. If you want to enjoy the colour smells vibrancy and cultural differences which make Marrakech such a fantastic destination you need to be prepared to travel in and out of the hotel regularly during your stay.    Obviously we were there at the end of the season and other guests have really enjoyed their stay at Tigmiza. It is a very well presented property and we would recommend it.,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Canberra, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelalot2000

They did arrange for us all the taxis very efficiently agreed for a late check-out and answered all our questions very kindly.

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,Russ G wrote a review Jun 2013,50,Balance the hustle and bustle with relaxation,A perfect base from which to explore Marrakech city and it's charms. A short fifteen minute drive from the hotel to the medina meant we could enjoy the hustle and bustle of the city and when needing a break escape to the hotel with its luxuries and two great swimming pools. The drive between the city centre and the hotel is really direct point to point and without any hassles. The hotel itself is something special. The staff were a pleasure from the moment of the first welcome by name at the entrance gate through to the reception (the welcome is with drinks and snacks in the lounge a great touch) and all other interactions. What makes Tigmiza a little different is that the rooms (suites as they are large with huge bed spacious bathroom and a lounge) are decorated according to a theme. We stayed in the Chinese suite and the Noire et Or suites both very different and good options. I was worried that the effect may be kitch but the interior decoration is brilliantly executed with top quality fittings and arrangments. A great sense of luxury. Breakfast was enjoyable served with some traditional Moroccan elements and the usual yoghurt croissant and breads. Both pools are great to spend time at the courtyard pool offers a special feel. A great option for balancing relaxing with the activities of the city centre. A wonderful hotel.,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Copenhagen, Denmark",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/russg910

Upon being greated by the staff when we arrived we were shown into a beautifully decorated room where we were offered refreshments and light snacks before check in. We found the staff at Tigmiza to be extremely helpful there was not anything that they would not do for us from organising us taxis to making us reservations at restaurants.

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,giampiero t wrote a review May 2013,50,Tigmiza a real oasis in Marrakech,"with my wife and our small dog have staid here at the Suite Noir&Or from the 2nd to the 6th of May. The hotel decoration is by a very clever Designer from Belgium that has given a beautiful look at all interiors and exteriors. The service is perfect with beautiful dressed costumes they will serve excellent bites and mint tea at your arrival and then again at every tea time. All suites are well described in internet so that everyone can choose what is best for them. We liked the most our suite noir&or. It is very funny and enjoyable to know that you can reserve your private Cinema with more than 300 titles. it is also not to be missed the small Night Club ""The Masai"" in african style and modern original music you can dance as long as you like.  Tigmza has beautiful gardens and 2 large swimming pools our preferred one is the one in the internal court sourrended by banana trees it is fantastic.  It is worth mentioning that they also have a private shuttle from the hotel to the Medina twice a day very convenient.

Tigmiza Boutique Hotel & Spa,IanAndrewR wrote a review Apr 2013,50,Marvellous Hotel & Staff,"We had four days of bliss at Tigmiza looked after with the rarest of kindness and attention. It wouldn't be fair to relate all of the small moments of generosity displayed by the staff at this wonderful hotel in case we set expectations for future guests unfairly high! Suffice it to say that whenever an opportunity presented itself to do what was easy or normal for the hotel or what was best for us as guests the staff unfailingly chose to do what was best for us.    I will relay one example because I think it conveys perfectly the way the team at Tigmiza chose to go the extra mile. Before we arrived we asked could we have one suite set up with two single beds to accommodate our two sons who at 12 and 15 prefer not to share a bed. Of course came the reply and normally that would be the end of that. On the morning of our arrival shortly after our punctual pickup from the Medina we were given the usual warm Moroccan welcome including mint tea orange juice water and small pastries. We were then told we would be shown a choice of adjoining suites and we could chose which we preferred. My well travelled seen it all kids immediately broke into huge smiles at the thought of choosing their own room. The first pairing two differently themed beautifully decorated rooms facing each other across a stairwell were set out as one twin and one double. I'd have stopped right there so gorgeous were they but after a few minutes to check them out we were taken up a floor to two identically set out rooms one double one twin except with completely different themes. The boys immediately fell in love with 'Le Chinoise' as I suspect the hotel knew they would as it was already laid out as a twin and pronounced it their choice. So the normally mundane checking into your room became an adventure and an event all thanks to the extra effort that the staff took it upon themselves to invest knowing it would make a difference to us. Thoughtful and classy.    Those first few minutes set the tone for our entire stay at Tigmiza. During our visit the hotel was quiet after what I later learned had been two very busy weeks over Easter. Easy in that situation for a hotel to relax a bit and catch a breath. Well not a bit of it at Tigmiza. We were made to feel like the most important guests they had ever had. Nothing was too much trouble for the team. ""You would like your desert in the cinema? Certainly sir."" Followed by a small team kicking into action putting on films moving tables bringing in food. I have to say that was so much fun. Sitting in huge red leather armchairs watching the big screen just the four of us with a cinema to ourselves munching on pudding and drinking wine.    So you get the idea. Unlike lots of places these days where it seems the guest exists to serve the hotel this is resolutely old school a hotel done the way they all should be 100% focused on the guest and the guests' enjoyment of their stay.    I could finish there but there are a few more things to mention. The pool area just about ideal with large comfortable recliners a bar with the usual discreet but attentive staff lots of shade or lots of sun whatever you want. You can have lunch by the pool and I daresay if you wanted it your breakfast or your dinner.    The hotel itself full of light and space quiet corners and comfortable bars is close enough to the city to be no obstacle to dining out or spending the day in the Medina or indeed hiking further afield. Be warned though like us you may not want to leave. In fact our recommendation would be stay in the Medina for a few days to 'do' Marrakech then head out to Tigmiza for the rest of your trip for peace quiet luxury and relaxation.    The cinema covered already but it must rank as one of the best film watching sessions we've ever had. Not to be missed if you have kids!    Breakfasts freshly prepared vast and tasty. Taken wherever you fancy.    Dinner we ate there one evening only. It was well prepared tasty traditional food. However my one criticism of the hotel is the dinner menu. Too short and too traditional. We love to eat well on holiday and had the menu been longer and more exciting we would have happily stayed in to eat every night. As it was we ventured out to the city in search of variety and invention.    The rooms again partly covered but worth a longer mention. Gorgeous in a word. Ace aircon super comfy beds great bathrooms (the boys was especially cool) a neat little lounge area everything sparkling clean.    Gym didn't use it (pfft) but it had all the kit.    The spa oh my the spa. How to describe the tonic massage. The woman who administered it had small hands that seemed to be made of soft flexible steel. It was incredible. It felt like I lost about five years of stress and tension from my whole body. The most incredible massage I have ever had. Imagine your spine turned into rubber your muscles into jelly and you get a sense for how relaxed both my wife and I were afterwards. I honestly would go back to Tigmiza just for that massage. The range of treatments is comprehensive. Really I could have stayed in there all day.    And finally the staff. You could put this staff in a flea pit broken down shack in some far off corner of the planet and I swear it'd feel like the best hotel you'd ever visited. This is a brilliant hotel any way you look at it but the staff through their every action and intention make it extra special.    This is an amazing place it's new so it doesn't have so many trip advisor reviews yet. Well you can safely ignore that lack of quantity (but trust the quality) and you should because this place deserves to be busy it deserves to be a huge success in what is a very crowded market.    One last thing to mention. On our trip we stayed in a Riad in the Medina hired a tour guide raced through the desert on dune buggies and ate at numerous restaurants. The one constant in all these things was Trip Advisor more or less everyone asked us for a review. We use Trip Advisor a lot when we travel and so it's become my habit to write reviews myself and one thing I truly dislike is being asked to give a 5 star rating. Yet on this trip we were many times. Consequently great places we would have reviewed well and extensively instead received a brief but fair review. The one place to explicitly ask us for a review who did not try to solicit a 5 star rating was Tigmiza. We were just asked for a review ""please tell us about your stay sir we would really appreciate you letting us know what you thought.""
