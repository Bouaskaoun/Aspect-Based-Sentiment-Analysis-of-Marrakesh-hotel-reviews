"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Dr M Tabany wrote a review Yesterday,20,"Rubbish 2* hotel, be careful they will charge you extra for different reasons management team are extremely rude AVOID",Since the majority of the information about this hotel is inaccurate and misleading on their website allow me to briefly explain each one (highly recommended for anyone who wants to make a reservation at the hotel):    Is it a 5-star hotel? No of course not. If you read my review and the hundreds of others they all tell the same tale. Do you believe a five-star hotel will convince visitors to pay to use the indoor pool? This one did; there are numerous other examples as well.    All-inclusive: Well this is not at all all-inclusive and the food and drink are of poor quality. Again I advise anyone considering making a reservation at the hotel to stay away and read reviews written by previous visitors before becoming extremely irate. We had two meals in a fine restaurant outside where the food was authentically Moroccan. This place serves only junk food.    Children: In this hotel a 12-year-old child is considered an adult. I know this is absurd and no other hotel has the same illogical unacceptable rules but trust me it is what it is.    Location: Is this hotel in Marrakesh? Well the location of the hotel is part of the countryside of Marrakesh is that makes sense however it is about 30 minutes away. You will need to keep booking Taxis for different visits to the town. Everything around the hotel is ugly and no where to go unless you book a taxi to the town if you want to do it everyday.    Management and staff: Although the restaurant and bar staff are pleasant and friendly they are also dissatisfied with the hotel management and are likely to start complaining if you speak to them. The management staff is very obnoxious rude and unprofessional and the person with glasses and waistcoat who checked us in was a real nightmare and very mean. They overcharged us and we reported them to the local police but somehow this hotel has hands everywhere so I assume it is the short landlord! You should avoid booking this hotel at all costs as I would not recommend the hotel whether you a are couple family or even solo.    To the Management Team: You should know that I will try my best to get my money that you stole refunded even if this takes me five years to get my ¬£152 back. You are aware that I am preparing to litigate against you but please be patient. Whatever response you give to this review I wouldn't put my trust in it‚Äîor in the corrupted security and police outside.,Date of stay: December 2022,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X6046XBmt
"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Yvie26 wrote a review Dec 2022,50,Best experience I've had,A brilliant hotel the hotel is amazing lovely and clean. The beds were comfortable and the rooms were cleaned daily to a high standard. The restaurant had a variety of different food daily so was always good options. The restaurant staff was amazing and was always checking we were ok. The animation team was the best they always made sure we were involved in the activities and letting us know when they were on Raf Racha Khalid Mouss Sousou and Mimi were really nice but Didy was the best he sat with us for lunch gave us good advice for our excursions and we would have long daily chats it felt more like talking to a really good friend the laughter we had he was so funny he made our whole experience even better and i will definitely becoming back and highly recommend staying here.,Date of stay: December 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yvetteafflick

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Lenishae B wrote a review Mar 15,50,"Beautiful hotel, exceptional staff",My first time visiting Marrakesh has been made so much better by staying in this hotel. All the staff have been super helpful especially Salima and her brother who made sure we had everything needed. They saw us coming from a mile off at every meal had our table prepared and as soon as we had collected our food from the buffet was right behind us to take our plates to the table.  Then we have the entertainment team. They were absolutely great. Especially Didy who took his time to explain what prices we should expect in the Souk and helped us not get ripped off by tourist prices. He was extremely attentive and helpful throughout the whole of our stay. All in all the customer service here is exceptional and aside from the 1 hiccup where they cleaned to room and forgot to leave us towels and I had to ask reception 3 times for towels I have nothing bad to say about this hotel. 10/10 would recommend.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lenishaeb

It was boring and the crew wasn‚Äôt that friendly. Diddy and James were really nice and helpful. Food was good and the entertainment also. But the ‚Äúlate‚Äù breakfast that they putting uncovered was eaten by the birds. No joke!‚Äú deposit‚Äù for towels for a 5* hotel? Not suitable. We had a early flight and I kindly asked the reception for a take away breakfast for the kids and they said that they will prepare it but in the morning they didn‚Äôt prepare nothing at all so we left the hotel with nothing.

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Caz B wrote a review Mar 4,50,Definitely book here,Where can I start this was amazing! We came here for a girly holiday (18+) a bit of winter sun away from the UK coldness and to just chill.  The hotel is very clean with an amazing scent of orange blossom when you enter.  All the reception staff and guys that take your luggage were very polite and professional.  The room was the perfect size for us without feeling like we were on top of each other and it was cleaned and made up every day.  There is a hotel shuttle bus to the centre every day book early to get the times you want but this was very easy to do.  The food was really lovely and varied lots of local flavours and the meal timings were perfect.  Selma who works at the bar was brilliant and made us a 'Selma Special' no idea what was in it but was delicious.  However one of the best parts of our holiday was the animation team. Didy Ricky Karim and Khalid were the best fun all week. Their English is brilliant and made us feel very special and involved. They are full of enthusiasm laughter and energy.  They started as hotel staff but we're going away as friends - they are really lovely and we really loved spending time with them.  Book this hotel get some sun and enjoy the culture colour and fun of this amazing place and obviously check out Selma Didy Ricky Karim and Khalid.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolbL5537CG

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Global66314502076 wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Eden Andalous hotel in Morocco,My friend and i stayed a week at the hotel and the overall service of the staff were extremly happy and friendly.  The reception staff are polite however their understanding of english is not the best and sometimes hard to get your point across.  The food is not the usual English cuisine however you dont expect this when you come to other countries. The food made infront of you is much better than the buffet selection. But overall the food is good quality.  The staff in the restaurant and bar are extremly attentive and friendly. They get to know who you are for your stay and remember your names.    The animation team are friendly and always happy to talk. They make time for you and make sure that you try and have the best time. They spent a lot of time with us throughout our stay and overall made the holiday much better. I think if i didnt speak to them and get to know them my overl experience would be lower. I learnt their names Diddy Ricky James Karim Namira and khalid.  You have to pay ¬£10 for towels on the first day however you get this back when leaving.    The room we stayed in was huge and massive it was clean tidy and the bathroom however unequiped with toilet roll and two towels. We had to ask for them multiple times.    The weather was hot when it wasnt cloudy (they cant change the weather unfortunately) but i would say overall it was a good holiday.

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Ryan wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Amazing February break with own waterpark!!,First few days the weather let us down being a tad cloudy and cold (being February was expected) however the amazing animation team ensured we were always happy and entertained! Daily activities like water polo archery table tennis darts kareoke dance lessons food lessons and more. The aquapark consists of 8 waterslides and a kids splash area which we all enjoyed and went to almost everyday. The food and catering stuff were amazing different every night with all your normal buffet style foods and Morrocan style foods (fresh salads vegatables and tagine) to a great standard. We had our rooms and towels replaced every morning as well as interconnecting rooms allowing the whole family enough space to relax and spread out. Only critiques may be the immediate local area - step outside the resort and prepare yourself for wild dogs and some slums further on. Saying this it was close to the heart of Marrakesh and we were really looked after. Big shoutout to animation team Kareem James and Ricky for making our holiday really special!,Date of stay: February 2023,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q7880BQryanr

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",syra a wrote a review Feb 2023,10,Not 5* but a 4* Hotel,Just returned back from this hotel. We stayed here between 17th-20th February and I wasn‚Äôt too impressed with everything.    Firstly the hotel looks nice from the outside and the reception. The room was spacious but not as clean as I thought it would be for a 5* hotel.    We booked all inclusive but had to pay ¬£3.50 for an ice cream. I have stayed at other 5* inclusive hotels and never had to pay for ice cream.    During breakfast lunch and dinner they serve you the food. The serving portions are small so you have to ask for seconds.    The hotel is 15min drive away from the main city centre and we paid ¬£12 to travel into the city. There is a shuttle bus but it gets booked up very quick.    Overall my experience on this trip wasn‚Äôt great. Food wasn‚Äôt anything wow and the portions was laughable.,Date of stay: February 2023,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/syraa2023
"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",soraya b wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Brilliant holiday,I honestly don‚Äôt know where to start with my review I just hope I have enough space to write everything!  We booked our trip just 2 days before we left it was a last minute decision and a very good one too! My husband and two daughters aged 8 and 11 and I have had a fantastic 8 days a holiday we won‚Äôt forget.  On arrival we were met by Lamia with a very warm welcome and a big smile a wonderfully helpful lady. Check in was quick and our bags were taken to our room by Redwan a super sweet porter with a massive smile!  Our room was absolutely perfect and far bigger than I had imagined. The super king bed was really comfortable and lovely quality bedding and pillows. Our daughters beds were great too and having the curtains that closed off our room gave us privacy so we could read and not keep them awake. 2 showers were a real bonus and very helpful with 3 lots of long hair to deal with after daily trips to the aqua park.  The wifi was good and we even had Netflix which was helpful while unpacking.  The rooms were a perfect temperature and cleaned to a very high standard. Fresh towels and toiletries each day.  The food was absolutely delicious plentiful and different options each day. If you want to eat pizza and pasta there is of course a station where they make it in front of you but if you prefer something more adventurous then the world is your oyster there are many many many options. The salad bar is beautifully displayed a fabulous choice of freshly baked breads and live cooking stations for various dishes. You are served your food by a waiter which is much more hygienic. The desserts are gorgeous and as they are bite sized you can try a bit of everything! Brian the Food and Beverage manager was always on hand if you needed anything and he made sure that service was efficient. They had food demonstrations so you could see how the food is created and even had a pancake station on Tuesday afternoon for pancake day!  The waiters are constantly offering drinks and making sure you have a clean table with cutlery and napkins. At breakfast there are two fresh orange juice stations a wonderful start to the day! The coffee is good quality and the fresh mint tea is divine. The staff are constantly cleaning and making sure the standards are high while retaining an extremely cheerful disposition and asking if you have what you need. The local beer is very nice and I enjoyed the cocktails too especially the Tom Collins!  The water park is a real bonus and we all loved it. The pools were super clean and such great fun. Safety standards are high and life guards manage the slides and pool‚Äôs extremely well.  Now to the animation team‚Ä¶.WOW!! How the team maintain their energy is beyond me and always with a smile. When they are not doing a mini disco or a fabulous show they are walking around and chatting to the children in various languages and making sure they have the best time. The animation is original fun age appropriate and they make everyone feel most welcome. There is always something for the children to do from archery too table tennis swimming to craft. Our daughters were so very sad to leave and asked if they can come again. After only 8 days they felt part of the animation team family. They wanted photographs with the animation team so they don‚Äôt forget them ever. There were many hugs as we left. The bar staff cleaners waiters maintenance men pool attendants and all staff are absolutely lovely and so polite I really hope the hotel owners know just how lucky they are to have such wonderful staff a real credit to them. We had the pleasure of meeting the Guest Services Manager Radwan on the first day just by chance as he asked if we needed anything and if we were enjoying our holiday. Randwan is a massive asset to the hotel and spends his day dealing with guest and always with a smile and respect. He helped us with local knowledge as we wanted to buy some specific items and always took his time to chat to us and make sure our needs were met. I have never seen management working on the ground so much they are normally locked in an office somewhere to never be seen but Radwan made sure he spoke to everyone and helped them make the best of their holiday. You can clearly see he is very experienced in management and I am sure will continue to ensure the business thrives.  All I can really say is if you want a great value holiday with delicious food wonderful staff fabulous weather and all in a beautiful country then this is the place for you!  We leave Marrakesh full of wonderful memories a few kilos heavier and with many new friends.  Book your holiday here a wonderful adventure awaits.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sorayabZ6830HW

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Laima K wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Splendid setting for a relaxed break,We have thoroughly enjoyed the stay in Eden Andalou with 2 kids and we are considering coming back here. I read some bad reviews before going and nothing turned out to be true! This makes me wonder if people were lying or the hotel has done its best to change everything that people complained about. We have used SPA facilities on the rainy days and during the sunshine warm pool outside is such a fun for kids. Only one aquapark slide-group is working in the winter but it was plenty enough and we knew to expect this. We got a way quieter time in exchange to a season when everything is working (and crowded).  We received a dinner into our room upon late arrival - they offered this even without asking. There IS a kettle cups glasses and plenty of water every day in the room. Room is cleaned and towels changed every day - whether you put a tag out or not. The food is varied every day and there are specials made in barbeque. It is only the same if you always visit pasta/pancake and tahini stand all the time. But there are 4 bars + outside stands serving the food and we found something new in the specials - absolutely delicious all the time. The deserts bar is varied every day as well and we have enjoyed too much of everything for sure. Moroccan cuisine is splendid and the chefs of this resort make sure to represent it right. They even served a char grilled whole lamb one evening. The drinks and coffee/tea are available ALL day from the Sun Bar if the restaurant is at break. On our last day we checked out after breakfast but only had our flight late at night - so we were offered a lunch after a checkout - again even without asking.  Kids loved the stay. Once they get hold of a concept of how to use the food bars and pick their favourite foods - they are able to serve themselves so easily. They enjoyed the activities and pools and are so sad to be home :)  And there are no good words enough to describe the staff doing their best all the time. Biggest thank you for each and every one of them.,Date of stay: February 2023,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laimak2023

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",@Explorejunkie wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Lovely place,Airport to hotel taxi costs 200 mad for 4 people.There is a free airport to hotel shuttle which was not included in our package.We arrived at night after the dinner hrs but they send up some basic meal to your room like salad cheese bread fruit which was sufficient as we just wanted to shower and sleep.  Very clean spacious suites and big bathrooms.Free wifi but works faster if you sit in the balcony.Lovely ambience and lots of comfy seating all over the place.A lovely resort feel . Atm machine in hotel not working so we used the atms at the souk - better exchange rates too.Daily cleaning. TV had some English channels - Comedy central ( just use the remote to change the audio language) Sky and cnn news Mbc had English movies. Of course we also could access our Netflix account for movies at night.Food was amazing different varieties of meat and vegetables - barbecued marinated with caramelised onions peppers etc. Only make sure you go to the buffet atleast one hour before it closes or the item of the day like barbecued chicken/sausages run out. Fresh pasta cooked in front of you .The buffet is one of the best I have tasted and I have been to many all inclusive hotels over Canary islands Caribbean and Spain and Egypt.There is one heated outdoor pool - this is shallow though  no deep end good for kids but not for advanced swimmers to take laps.There is a bigger outdoor pool but cold so hardly anyone uses it.The Aquapark is connected to the hotel just a min walk - we enjoyed the multi slides and at the bottom you slide into a heated pool of 1.3 m depth.This was a lot of fun as there is no big queue like the Canary island waterparks.There is a spa  sauna and massage available ( extra)with heated indoor pool - this costs 150 mad per person per day - we used this on one of the weekdays when it unfortunately rained the whole day .I would recommend going to visit the Ouzoud waterfalls  Ourika Valley and Marrakesh souk if you want to see the local people  culture and also enjoy haggling and getting some lovely souvenirs like poufs leather bags counterfeit clothes.Book excursions via viator or trip advisor because the hotel guy charged a higher price for the same trips.They will contact you on WhatsApp with a time to pick you up.There was animation and entertainment at night but I would rather watch my netflix series after a heavy meal and a drink.  Unlimited drinks available all day till 11 pm I think at the Sun Bar.  Highly recommend this hotel for families .Very relaxing.Friendly staff .,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Altrincham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Explorejunkie

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Laima K wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Splendid setting for a relaxed break,We have thoroughly enjoyed the stay in Eden Andalou with 2 kids and we are considering coming back here. I read some bad reviews before going and nothing turned out to be true! This makes me wonder if people were lying or the hotel has done its best to change everything that people complained about. We have used SPA facilities on the rainy days and during the sunshine warm pool outside is such a fun for kids. Only one aquapark slide-group is working in the winter but it was plenty enough and we knew to expect this. We got a way quieter time in exchange to a season when everything is working (and crowded).  We received a dinner into our room upon late arrival - they offered this even without asking. There IS a kettle cups glasses and plenty of water every day in the room. Room is cleaned and towels changed every day - whether you put a tag out or not. The food is varied every day and there are specials made in barbeque. It is only the same if you always visit pasta/pancake and tahini stand all the time. But there are 4 bars + outside stands serving the food and we found something new in the specials - absolutely delicious all the time. The deserts bar is varied every day as well and we have enjoyed too much of everything for sure. Moroccan cuisine is splendid and the chefs of this resort make sure to represent it right. They even served a char grilled whole lamb one evening. The drinks and coffee/tea are available ALL day from the Sun Bar if the restaurant is at break. On our last day we checked out after breakfast but only had our flight late at night - so we were offered a lunch after a checkout - again even without asking.  Kids loved the stay. Once they get hold of a concept of how to use the food bars and pick their favourite foods - they are able to serve themselves so easily. They enjoyed the activities and pools and are so sad to be home :)  And there are no good words enough to describe the staff doing their best all the time.

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",michael wrote a review Jan 2023,20,Aggressive security member,I really liked the hotel but one aggressive security team member that‚Äôs on in the evening has left a massive negative impact on our stay.    One evening my son (12 years old) returned to our room crying and upset  Once I had calmed him down he explained that one of the security team had physical grabbed him so forcefully by his chest and another boy by his collar and pushed them down the stairs from the first floor and slapped both of them on the back.  The security guard denied doing anything.  Even though the was red marks over his chest.    We reported it to reception where tv evidence showed him pushing my son.  Nothing was done and the same security person was on every night.    My son was then very apprehensive to go down for dinner every night.    The kids where messing around upstairs where they shouldn‚Äôt be but to physically put hands on a child should not be acceptable no matter what country.  But unfortunately this seems to be ok to treat children this way in Morocco.  I would advise any parents to not let there kids out of their sight if this person is working.    I‚Äôve attached a photo of the security team member,Date of stay: December 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Brighton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Global68000376129

He introduced me to Mr Sammy from Animation team. they all took so much effort in planning the cake cutting and photography etc. it was a nice surprise for my husband.

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Evana wrote a review Dec 2022,20,Not a 5 STAR aqua park resort.....more of a 3 star!,Where do i begin? Stayed over xmas hols and the only highlight was the sun & heat & the company we had....This is no 5 star resort...... so if you're paying for 5star expect to get a more of 3 or 4 star resort (& this was my children‚Äôs feedback)    We were 3 families travelling with children. There was no food for late arrivals as all restaurants were closed. When enquired about food was told all food would be free as room service for that one night (was assured thrice) but upon ordering food was told its chargeable - by room service team who became argumentative. Only salad was free which we were told we wouldn't like! When confronted reception staff they went back on their word ü§î We understand food maybe charged due to our late arrival (not that we could help that either) but when assured on numerous occasions it was free it became the principle of the matter. To top it off food took over 2hrs we got all our food at 2am; our kids went to sleep tired & hungry & we ended up sending majority food back & asked to feed the onsite staff so food wasn't wasted....We requested matter be raised with manager & again assured it would be. Noone came back to us. Spoke to Customer Relations Manager following afternoon who listened attentatively advised would raise with GM & basically avoided us for the rest of the holiday ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è & no GM nor any manager came back to speak to us about our initial experience.We still got charged & paid in full for the food...    As for being ALL INCLUSIVE unlike all other 5 star resorts we have visited we were charged for:  Ice creams (despite majority of guests are families with children) not even basic scoop icecream is offered  All Room service (no food/drink allowed back into rooms from restaurant either)  Poolside towels have to be rented  Shuttle service returning back to airport (despite site advises free airport shuttle service)  Only 1 restaurant; sun bar & snack bar was included; other restaurants not available (alot of the food/drink advertised on social media as result was not available despite you get the impression it is)  Food was mediocre it was more about decorative appeal than taste &/or mainly catered to French pallate only. No other range was offered apart from on Xmas eve but even then food was bland. Options were repetitive & not much options for kids. Our kids basically survived on plain pasta or pizza all week for lunch n dinner. Food would be cold & if ran out would majority of time not be replenished. Deserts were poor options & again repetitive. We actually ventured out for few meals outside of hotel simply to satisfy the kids!  Snack bar served leftover lunch & refused to make anything more if food ran out. No soft drinks/hot drinks available had to go back over to sun bar to get anything apart from morrocon tea.  Drink options limited from bar. Tea option was limited to only Green tea Lipton tea or morrocon tea. Coffee come from the machines nothing freshly made/brewed. Mocktails were limited to 3 flavours which all taste the same. Water would only be served in glasses. Although plenty of waiters around we had to self serve.  Appeared staff & management did do favouritism in serving select few customers & were very attentive to their needs whilst ignoring everyone else.    Staff generally lacked service with a smile. Language was clearly an issue (only seemed to be nice to the French speaking/morroccons/white brits). Out of all staff we did find 1 restaurant staff member (Taha) who remained consistent in his service from start to finish. He always smiled & was very attentive with all he served & was genuinely friendly. He was accommodating hard working & treated everyone with excellent manners & equally. Most staff who didnt know the answer to a question would fob off & not make any attempt to even find out the answer for example when asked about hiring shisha was told there was a wait - asked how long staff said she didnt know & walked off without anything further to say!  Reception staff unfortunately seemed to have a general habit of ignoring you & talked amongst themselves. As mentioned management avoided us throughout the holiday. We weren't even asked at the end of our stay by any staff at checkout how was our stay & if we were satisfied with our stay (box standard customer service questions in any hotel!)    Entertainment (Animation team) is group of people who provide all entertainment Inc exercise in morning (water aerobics; zumba or yoga) activities throughout the day (archery/darts) & evening entertainment. The team were all lovely as people & friendly but it was too much for a small group of entertainers to manage literally ALL entertainment & hence became repetitive & limited. They had to restrict timings on certain entertainment esp for kids despite many of the guests were kids who stayed up for the entertainment. Again for a 5-star resort more external entertainers should have been brought in; with different themed nights provided by external entertainers. Given it was Xmas there was no santa/small token gifts etc for the children. They did arrange 3 entertainers who were very basic & boring to watch on one evening; u get more from the street entertainers on the Square! All entertainment especially for kids was rushed &/or limited for short periods. Advertising face painting on Xmas eve but was literally only available for an hour....like everything I believe although they were trying to bring fun entertainment they were too limited due to what they could do between themselves.    As for the rooms it was a large family suite which was relatively clean however we found:  Showers leaked - door didn't close properly (all 3 rooms had same issue)  Ant infestation  No Muslim shower in toilet (given its an Islamic country)  Cleaners left dirty rags  Dirty towels were refolded instead of being replaced  No kettle/hot drink station in rooms  No cups given with the 2l water bottles  No food/drink is allowed in room from the restaurant (otherwise will be charged)    Finally the Aqua Park (which was the real reason we booked this resort)....  Not fully opened or fully staffed - only 1 slide opened majority of the time. We were at resort for 7 days & 1 other 'slide' was opened once  All pools were freezing - only 1 was 'heated' in the resort itself but to be honest I think it was more heated by the sun. The opened slide pool was also heated by the sun. So basically advise is to time visits to pools/park when sun is at its peak (but note park close between 1-2pm or wait till when weather is hotter.  Park was deserted because of how freezing the water was.  Spa which had the only real indoor heated pool & jacuzzi was chargeable  Really the pools should all be heated during winter period (if they are choosing to keep the park open over winter) but if they do choose to close over winter period then this should be advised on site so people know that they are only booking hotel & not the park & priced accordingly  The surroundings was a construction site & as a result all areas were dusty.    It's such a shame. If we were paying for a 3-star or 4-star resort I would tolerate all the above but we didn't we paid for a 5 star aqua park resort as advertised. The hotel has alot of potential to be better but requires management/owners to take feedback on board & invest into making this a better place & live upto the star rating. Unfortunately I would not be recommending this resort which is a shame. Believe as they don't have much surrounding competition as an 'aqua park resort' they can offer a mediocre 3 star service. Maybe if more open they may reconsider n put more effort into improving. For now will have to give poor review.,Date of stay: December 2022,,"Ashford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/519evanak
"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",F M wrote a review Dec 2022,10,DO NOT BOOK! NOT 5*,Do not book this hotel for your stay in Marrakech. I have stayed in 3* hotels here which have been much better in terms of service rooms and food.  My room was not ready until an hour later than check in time at 3pm. I travelled with a baby so arrival was not very smooth. I had informed them via email that I needed a cot and was assured this will be available. This was not! I requested again when I got to the room but they did not bring it until 4 hours later so I had a screaming overtired baby!  There was no hot water so I had to have a cold shower. This was fixed after 3 hours of reporting this!  Housekeeping was requested at midday a couple of times to clean my room they did not arrive until 8pm which was too late as my baby had gone to sleep.  All inclusive food was not good they control how much and when you can get the food.  Finally the hammam and spa was the worst ever experience! I paid so much for the worst massage and hammam experience. They burned me with hot water and the masseuse ripped my hair out trying to massage my head!!!  Overall one of the worst hotels I've stayed at. 5* rating should be removed!,Date of stay: December 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fmia0501
"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",A M wrote a review Dec 2022,20,Definitely not 5 star. Not just me noticing whilst there,Such a nice resort...i mean it has the potential for so much more. Stayed over Xmas holidays and lets just say best thing was the sun was out and had great friends to keep us calm. Arrived with small children just before midnight. Was assured then reassured food was complimentary via room service only to be enlightened it was chargeable even though the order was sent to our rooms 2 hours later. Kids went to sleep hungry complained to staff guest manager no satisfactory response poor customer service for that so 1 star only as cant give zero stars. Not charging for the food and sincere apologies would have been the least one would expect! Still waiting for General Manager response although they seemed to have stopped making eye contact after our complaint.  Definitely not 5 star. As for the resort: Aqua park had one ride open for 7 day. Olympic pool was cold and not in use. No tea or kettle in the rooms which was strange although what was stranger they left 2 litre water bottles without a glass to pour into and drink from. Were informed by the guest manager that only 2 irons in the whole resort so expect 3 days to get it to your room or sit on them and hope the creases come out. All inclusive isnt really all inclusive; had to pay for ice cream if you can find it. Asked for shisha was told dont know when we could expect to get it so ended up going out . Snack bar opened between 4-5pm and had same tuna panini for 7 days so look forward to dinner at 7pm only to perceive its more or less the same for that too. They are consistant in just not pushing that bar higher in every department to make it a resort you want to come back to. My neighbours room had a ant infestation in the bathroom but was cleaned quickly after kids screamed. Did i mention gyms closed sundays? Guess 5 star doesn't mean much in this hotel. Met one waiter named Taha he was absolute gem and gave a great service. The restaurant manager was rude and told some one infront of me making her tea to hurry up. I did mention his attitude lacked courtesy and to be fair met me next day and acknowledged that flaw in him. Hope he has changed.  Rooms were nice but the shower door allowed water to seap out causing a slipping hazard and resulted in using all the clean towels getting used to clean up a mess. And the excursion team well lets say shop around as its cheaper outside but thats standard where ever you go.  Drinks were served near the bar but it was self service so expect to que up and dont expect waiter to ask you what you would like to drink like other 5 star resorts. There were no ash trays on the tables so after requesting and losing the will to wait one may be obliged to ash where ever one likes.  If someone had warned me i may have thought twice about booking this place. The management looking over this site needs to seriously look into taking feedback seriously as after writing this review ive noticed many others have complained.  Take home message..if you like disappointments then this is the place for you.,Date of stay: December 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X5841FHam

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",rebeccaw07 wrote a review Nov 2022,40,Bit tired but lovely hotel,Staff- the staff are very friendly and always helpful. The animation team were great at getting people involved. Bar staff were always quick and polite.    Rooms- the rooms were absolutely massive especially for just 2 people. The bathroom seemed a little tired. There was no curtain for the bath and the shower door wasn't secure so let water out but always clean!    Pools- heated pool was perfect for the time of year but full of kids. The large pool was freezing but plenty of loungers. The indoor pool is also quite tired looking and there was a fee for this.    Aquapark- much bigger than expected with multiple choice of slides. It all looks well kept and their was lifeguards on duty which is good.    Food- so much choice! As a vegetarian I never felt like there wasn't options. Always at least 3/4 meat options loads of salad and veg and the pizza/pasta was tasty. It isn't self serve which seems weird at first but it helps with organisation they gave massive portions and all of them wore gloves.    Entertainment- personally I thought the kids club started too late (9pm) which was a bit annoying to have to sit through whilst you're eaten/before entertainment. Seems to be karaoke every other night with little variety on the other nights.    Spa- the spa stuff are so lovely and great at their job. The treatments are very well priced. Would definitely recommend the massages.    Also great that they have a bus into the market as its quite far away. Arrived and left exactly when it says it will.

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Sina S wrote a review Nov 2022,40,"Scenic, beautiful, relaxing and most importantly very kind and friendly staff!",The hotel is beautiful and the suites are spacious and suitable for a family of 3. The staff were absolutely amazing and helped us with everything that we asked for. We made some lifetime friends with some of the people from the entertainment (animation) team who are extremely friendly and welcoming. The reason for the 4 star was the Wi-Fi connection which cut out a lot during our stay however it is understandable for the size of the hotel and how far the hotel was from the main square (centre of Marrakesh). Therefore if you missed the last shuttle bus from the square you will have to haggle a lot with taxi drivers from the centre back to the hotel!  Didi Sousou Raf and all of the entertainment team genuinely made this holiday so enjoyable for us as a family.

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",PuchiOki wrote a review Nov 2022,50,Great 4 night stay,We had a really fabulous stay at Eden Andalou!    1. There was more than enough food all the time. Breakfast starts early and carries on till 10.30. Lunch starts at 12-2.30. Snack time from 4pm to 6pm and dinner at 7 to 10.30pm. There was so much food that you could arrive at 10.30pm and still find everything fully loaded.    It was also very varied and delicious fish meat chicken vegetables bread rice‚Ä¶ desserts!    2. Aqua park was fabulous the kids just loved it. Plenty of rides and more than ample space for people to go on slides multiple times.    3. Really kept very clean and staff are constantly cleaning all the communal areas all the time.    4. The staff in particular Lamia was helpful. We had a very late check out (3.30pm) and they didn‚Äôt hassle us at all anout this.    5. Restaurant staff are hard working you can see them continuously cleaning and helping guests..    6. Rooms were really big - we were four and we had two singles and a massive super king in a room with another room separated by a thick curtain plus sofas. Really big room and the beds were fantastic.    7. We were told that the only way to book the shuttle was through the concierge the day before. We arrived when the concierge opened at 9 and requested the first shuttle for the next day only to be told all the days morning shuttles were already booked through reception. So we had conflicting advice about shuttle bookings. They advised us we could just check the shuttle has space as sometimes people don‚Äôt turn up.    8. Shuttle to and from the medina is fabulous and dead on time. One of the drivers (has a beard) is really nice we hadn‚Äôt booked and asked can we join if there is space anfter everyone who has booked on has taken their seat in the bus and he said no problems just get on. The other driver (darker chubby guy) he said no to us and then even though there was space he was unwelcoming about us getting on the shuttle. I don‚Äôt expect this from a five star hotel. Just be polite and say you will check if there is space and make us feel you will try to get us on even if you can‚Äôt. In the end he said okay get on and there was plenty of space however he made us feel as though we were making him carry us himself!    9. The room cleaning could be better specially in the bathroom.    10. The hotel is kept immaculate downstairs in all areas plus rooms and a lot of waiters and waitresses are truly hard working. I think customer service training specially in hospitality and service with a smile would greatly improve the guest experience because in most other ways this is a fantastic hotel and I would definitely come back again.    I asked for an iron and ironing board and this was sent  in quickly. However the next day when we called reception for something else no one picked up at all and had this been a medical emergency that would have been a bad situation however it was just a small query but surprised no one picked up.    We wanted to play chess but the place where you get games from closed at 6pm but we didn‚Äôt know this so we asked and one of the entertainment team (he had a bandage around his big toe) told us we have to ask reception even though we found out when we asked the reception that the place where you get games from closed at 6pm. The reception staff were concerned that one of their staff had misguided us and asked us who said this to us but we were not aware of the person‚Äôs name. So it‚Äôs clear that they really want to get service spot on but these little things can make you feel a bit - ‚Äúthat‚Äôs odd!‚Äù    Only other thing that they could have done for me to say this is a great experience would be a kettle and tea and coffee in the room itself but I am English so it might just be my tea needs!    Otherwise fabulous stay.,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PuchiOki

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",William K wrote a review Oct 2022,10,2.5-3 star partially all-inclusive hotel with trust issues,Currently 1 day into a 7 day stay at the hotel and honestly I‚Äôm scouring for other hotels nearby that we could move to.    Let me first say that the staff have been friendly and can‚Äôt be faulted however they‚Äôre dealing with some frankly idiotic policies in how the how is being run.    It titles itself as a 5 star family friendly hotel (the latter presumably because of the large water park attached). It is also an all inclusive resort.    Now we booked with the expectation that 5 star in Morocco was likely not at a standard comparable with developed countries.    The room we have is a pool side family suite. Pool side here does not mean ‚Äúat the side of the pool‚Äù. It means ‚Äúon the same side of the hotel as the pool‚Äù. It‚Äôs a bit misleading but no big deal. The room itself is decent. A decent size for 2 adults and 2 under 10s. Fixtures and fittings would equate to about a 3.5 star in my opinion. The bathroom could‚Äôve done with a proper clean also but nothing again that I wouldn‚Äôt expect in a 3-3.5 star hotel.    Wifi is described as high speed but I can only imagine that this was written when we were all still on dialup.    Coming to the running of the hotel. As I mentioned it is all-inclusive (I believe although not certain that all guests are all-inclusive). It feels however as if the hotel is terrified of this costing them money. I don‚Äôt know if they don‚Äôt charge enough or maybe their costs have gone up with global economy they way it is but everything is controlled to the extent that it feels as if there is no trust in the guests. Portions are rationed out by servers. We asked for a bottle of water for our table (4 of us remember) and it was refused. Instead we were brought a plastic glass of water each and had to constantly call a wAiter for top up. Food is served on plastic plates and it seems that we‚Äôre allowed (thank goodness) a metal knife and fork however if you want a spoon it‚Äôll be plastic. This is barely 3 star standard most probably less.    In order to get towels for the pool you have to go to reception and hand over 100 in local currency (about 10$\‚Ç¨) for each towel you require then to be given a piece of laminated paper token one for each towel and a sheet paper proving that you‚Äôve paid. These then need to be given to a pool attendant in exchange for a towel. Never have I felt less trusted. It should be noted that this charge is refundable on check out if you return the tokens.    It‚Äôs not possible to add this charge to the room either. Which brings me to another point. Nothing in the hotel that is not included in the rate is chargeable to the room. Everything needs paid for in local currency. And many things are not included in all-inclusive. For example there is a snack bar but if you want an ice cream (eg a snickers) this needs to be paid for‚Ä¶in cash.    Anyway I‚Äôm at 2300 characters in this review and I could probably go on for at least that again but I‚Äôm supposed to be on holiday.    So in short if you‚Äôre looking for what is overall a 2.5-3 star partially all-inclusive hotel with a decent room but questionable food and hotel policy that makes you feel like a thief then you could do worse than come here (maybe).,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/140WilliamK

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",zooloo83 wrote a review Oct 2022,30,Nice stay but not 5*,A large group of us went to Eden Andalou near the end of the summer holidays. We were three families with approximately 10 children between us!    This is my second visit to Morocco first time was over 10 years ago when I went without children and stayed in a Riad. We chose this hotel as we thought it would be convenient to stay in an all inclusive with young children.    I will summarise below:    Positives:  - Beautiful lobby  - Staff very accommodating  - Choice of three pools was nice  - Staff cleaned the rooms nicely every day  - Khadjia from the animation team was very good and the evening entertainment was fun to watch and kids enjoyed the disco.  - When we were ill the provided us with medication quickly at the reception.  - Hamam was very good felt very relaxed and was a great experience.  - The laundry service was very good    Negatives  - Flies would be on the serving station on the food outside I believe some form of mesh cover would be suitable for when they are serving food outside. As a result I never ate from the pool bar as the food was always covered with flies  - Staff would take a long time to clear drinks from pool side tables and therefore we would be plagued by flies and bees constantly as they would be coming for the glasses with bits of juice left. In the end I would pick the empty glasses and take them back  - No iron in the room  - We had to take our own luggage up when we arrived  - Food although was tasty felt very same same by the end of our 6 day stay  - When they booked our excursion they did not take into account my youngest son and therefore I had to put him on my lap during the transport which was quite dangerous when driving windy roads  - Our room was not done properly when we arrived and we had to call the help to sort the beds for our three children  - Not enough floats in the water park to go on the lazy river my friend and I were waiting for 30 mins and gave up.  - The kids club was very run down. There was no actual programme and it reminded me of scenes Chernobyl lol    Overall we had a good time but more so as we went as a large group of friends and made the most of it as opposed to the hotel being amazing.,Date of stay: August 2022,,"Ilford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zooloo83

The hotel was spotless and cleaniness was kept on top of by staff constantly including daily house keeping with fresh towels Toiletries and free water bottles.  The restaurant served breakfast lunch and dinner which had a good variety of foods as well as a separate area that served extra food between lunch and dinner.  We was easily able to book excursion from the hotel lobby which came with a shuttle bus to locations. The hotel also provided free shuttle bus to the Market and free access to the Aqua Park which was an extra bonus.    Everyone was very welcoming and helpful from reception staff to bar staff even the cleaning staff. We had most interaction with the animation team Didy Asma Rizki and Moiusse who went out their way for us on many occasions to make our holiday more enjoyable so a huge thank you to them.

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",DJ wrote a review Sep 2022,20,Past is sell by date,We booked the Eden Andalou having researched as much as was worthwhile online and knowing it wouldn‚Äôt be a true 5*‚Ä¶in fact during our stay the signs were changed to 4* which I feel is still 1* too generous.  Firstly it‚Äôs only 15 mins from the airport. If getting a cab use this info when you barter price.  It‚Äôs an All Inclusive & they band you when checking-in. But the food is strictly between certain hours for breakfast lunch and dinner with a 1 hour ‚Äòsnack window‚Äô. All meals in the same place bar the snacks. The food is ok/samey/edible you won‚Äôt feel spoilt for choice nor over fed. For breakfast you can get oranges then lunch bananas and apples will turn up and then at dinner maybe some plums but never give you the selection all at the same time! We had to hoard fruit as we found it for our kids!  I got an upset stomach on our 5th day which had been the concern when reading reviews. One guest told me he‚Äôd heard 60% of guests have some kind of stomach complaint‚Ä¶this really shouldn‚Äôt be tolerated by booking companies & this hotel shouldn‚Äôt be offered by mainstream providers until they sort this issue.  Ice Creams not included (35 dirhams each) which is poor and All Inclusive ends at 11pm room service add on‚Äôs available there after. Tourist Tax (40 dirhams per night) on arrival for over 12‚Äôs and a very bureaucratic towel deposit scheme (100 dirhams per towel for length of stay). Given one room key only with a 50 dirham fine if you lose it  Kid facilities such as kids club (bizarrely located in a building 100+ yards in-front of reception away from all other hotel facilities cots high chairs were available. Kids disco not until 9pm!  The wifi is patchy at best I wasn‚Äôt overly bothered as it kept me off my phone.  The pools are cold but to be fair it‚Äôs hot outside  The rooms are a decent size. Minimal power outlets air con noisy. But kept clean and mostly had hot water. 2 large bottles of water left daily we used these to brush teeth with also (recommend avoiding using tap water or having ice in drinks). No slippers/gowns stationary iron info pack kettle/coffee maker etc which is standard in most 5*. Little things like bathrooms looking tired broken tiles broken bins few ants in the room. Nothing major but they all leave an impression.  The hotel is large and was probably impressive when built but it‚Äôs tired. It needs repairs and updating! Although looking past its best the hotel is clean. Amenities always in very good order and grounds maintained well  On a night when Morocco were playing football on TV a large group of locals suddenly appeared to watch the game‚Ä¶so the all inclusive paying guest stance suddenly changed! The evenings entertainment was prematurely cut short and kids disco squeezed into halftime so the commentary and game dominated the entire plaza‚Ä¶I love football I have nothing against watching a countries national team‚Ä¶it wasn‚Äôt right to make this the focal point of the whole evening  The staff are hit and miss some attentive some stand off‚Äôish you‚Äôll more likely need to approach them than them come to you. Bizarrely they appear to work and then suddenly will be ahead of you in food queues and eating in restaurant along with guests front and back of house doesn‚Äôt seem to exist here. The animation team were proactive & friendly but be warned they will swarm on attractive women. When the weather turned wet/cold they had no Plan B and just sat about and offered no indoor activities.  Management would hang about occasionally never greeting guests or asking how stay is. Deluding themselves that everything is well  The sister water park is next door across a small dirt track. It did the job for the kids although you can only take water in and they do bag search (albeit not well as we took snacks buried in bags in). The entrance between the hotel and water park is 2 ungated openings whereas they have security and barriers at the front of hotel‚Ä¶I‚Äôd suggest if they want to keep people out this is a fairly fundamental issue.  All in (if I put the food poisoning aside) the hotel was ok it was alright it was meh. We came to see the city/medina which is a must do. We did a 1/2 day excursion which we‚Äôd booked before arriving (not through hotel) & I would say given time spent in the hotel 5 nights would be ample! I‚Äôm certain you can find better places to go with children than this hotel. I wouldn‚Äôt consider coming back to this resort.,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dave67814

Not sure where all the bad reviews have come from the hotel and rooms are in a traditional Moroccan style and are kept spotlessly clean. The gardens are well tended with paths to wander around and enjoy the grounds. As you can't drink the tap water two big bottles were left in our room for drinking and teeth cleaning which was a nice touch. All staff we encountered were friendly and polite during our stay. The entertainment team are a credit to the hotel always chatting and inviting you to join in the activities and the bar staff were polite and helpful even going so far as to teach me some arabic beyond hello please and thanks! The food is not repetitive with a wide choice of meat and vegetable dishes and a lot of it was cooked fresh in front of us.

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Ela wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Great place!,We had a very good stay at Eden Andalou. We loved the super large and comfy bed and spacious bathroom with shower bathtub and two sinks. We had a small terrace with a table just for our room. I loved doing yoga every morning on the grass in front of our room just under olive and dates trees.    Choice of food is wide and it was delicious. My boyfriend had 2 glasses of freshly squeezed orange juice each morning for breakfast - that's how good it was.    Pool is large and clean. Got real good swimming and pictures. Drinks are served all the time and there was great activity team to cover long hours by the pool. Stretching dance and games. In the evenings they throw a few-hours long show for kids and adults with music singing dancing and other stuff like karaoke. Best team. Special greetings to Sheima who is the best!,Date of stay: September 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/speranza16

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Kelly wrote a review Sep 2022,10,Would not recommend,Myself and my partner spent a week here in early September. The hotel itself is nice and clean no issues with hotel staff they were all very polite and helpful apart from the restaurant staff. The only thing that ruined our trip was the food same thing served most days not self service which is not an issue however the staff are not wearing gloves. Unknown to the restaurant staff my partner can also speak Arabic and caught them on more than one occasion talking about how much a foreigner would be eating/ insisting on serving the Moroccan guests first. When confronted about commenting they act all shy and apologized but continued to do this for some other foreign guests in the queue who clearly do not understand what they are saying. Like a lot of other reviews on here both of us had severe food poisoning with constant vomiting and had not eaten out of the hotel grounds so it could only be from there I imagine this is from the food being put out for both lunch and dinner including one of the waiters taking unused bread rolls from a guests plate and putting them back in the buffet. Overall unless you want to be sick on your holiday I would not recommend this hotel,Date of stay: September 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kelly4278

This is our opi ni,We arrived on Saturday 17th Sept. Our flight (Ryanair) should have left Edinburgh at 16.25 but never departed until nearly 22.00hrs. We sat for 2hrs on plane. When we arrived at the Eden Andalou they could not have been more helpful. The only bad thing was we never got our poolside suite. They put us in a villa room beside the aqua park which was a long walk from the main hotel they brought us food and drink. We got to bed after 4am shattered but had a wonderful sleep in a super comfy bed. We got our suite about 12noon the next day. It is very clean quiet and not far from the pool reception and dining areas. So far we have no complaints but then we haven‚Äôt really had to ask for much. The room is absolutely fine air con sufficient maid service daily clean spacious and quiet. The food is extremely good and there is a great choice especially at the breakfast sittings.

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Audrey M wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Lovely property with great staff,I have to say having read some reviews before arriving I was a little concerned absolutely no need. Large property with great sized rooms and plenty space around to chill or sunbathe. Staff were lovely overall remembering English is their third language in most cases. Food was nice lots of fantastic salads and grills freshly cooked pastas pizzas something for everyone. The animation team were so lovely not forceful in trying to get people to join always smiling and working very long hours. Shout to Majda so happy at work and Chaima for amazing dancing and energy. Bar staff also really helpful and nice.  Constructive points; In a five star resort I‚Äôd expect daily pool towels without a deposit  Fantastic water park totally under-utilised possibly provide water only for all inclusive or hold some daytime activities there?  Evening entertainment have the kids time early and let us appreciate the fantastic singer before the show or give him the show rather than lots of dancing displays. Quiz night and karaoke were a nice variety  Please check the rap music played by the pool is family appropriate (easily missed in 3rd language but important to point out)  Larger glasses for soft drinks to save numerous bar trips in 36 degrees  Really liked the staff served the buffet but felt this led to a lot of food waste as they always gave huge portions!

They cut off our bands and told us that we could not eat or drink anymore. Our transfers did not arrive until 6pm. As soon as you check out they treat you like a stray dog!!  They made us sit in a section and watched us we had children with us and they had to watch everyone eat and drink around them. The hotel is all inclusive and it makes no difference to them if we had a food or some drinks (as you know Morrocco is extremely hot).  From my previous experience other hotels let you chill for the day until your transfer arrives as they know you are practically stranded!!

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Ellie123 wrote a review Sep 2022,20,Not all it‚Äôs advertised to be,Arrival was smooth at this hotel with fairly quick check in receptionist did try to over charge us for the room tax and my partner had to show him the calculations and still no apology.  We arrived just before dinner service finished so grabbed a quick bite but hardly anything left but chips. We then went to the room which we were disappointed to find hadn‚Äôt been cleaned properly. This started our holiday off pretty badly.  We informed reception of the state of our room and they looked at at blankly no apology and said the room would be cleaned again.  To be fair after we complained this was not a further problem. Water left in room everyday which was helpful.  The food at this hotel isn‚Äôt great they don‚Äôt have many options and not much for Brits. Myself and my partner ate almost the same thing everyday. May I add the food is basically the same everyday maybe 2 different dishes of which we were disappointed by.  We had to order in food because they provide no snacks in between meal times. We were here for a week and there were only snacks and toasties 2 out of 7 days here. We ate out a few times to try and avoid the constant repetitive meals. You also have to pay for ice creams and no crisps or snacks to grab. Also all the cups are plastic! Which we thought was terrible for a supposed 5 star hotel.  Few days before the end of our holiday we only ate at the hotel and just as other reviews say myself and my partner had food poisoning. Ruining our last two days. They sent a nurse to our room which gave us 4 tablets to last the day may I add it‚Äôs difficult to get medication for food poisoning. I also had to see a doctor in the airport and now one at home as I have to take time off work.  If I‚Äôm honest the only people that made us feel welcome were the animation team they were spot on. Saying hello and good morning and getting us to join in. Everyone else pretty much acted like they didn‚Äôt want us there.  I won‚Äôt be staying here again this is not 5 star service at all and we were overall really disappointed. Morocco as a whole was beautiful and lots to see it‚Äôs fairly central but did pay out a lot in taxis going out to the centre.  I would also not recommend going here as a couple definitely more for families.  This hotel needs some serious improvement food wise as well as updating of the rooms.,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/243ellieg

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Sarah K wrote a review Sep 2022,10,Disgraceful,Where do I start  Management and reception staff  Totally unprofessional and not welcoming at all everything is an effort from check in to check out.    Rooms are out dates and in need of an extreme makeover  Cracked tiles mould and toilet in the bathroom not cleaned so spelt of urine also a lovely pube on the toilet seat to greet us. Mini fridge was disgusting with some sort of rust at the bottom and is not somewhere you would really want to store anything. Balcony door didn‚Äôt lock properly and railings tired rusted and need an update. The rooms are well sized but grotty.    Pools again need a good overall but the most shocking is when someone did a poo in it and it was just fished out with a net which was then walked around the pool for everyone to see and then we were told it was clay not poo as we said the pool should be closed down and filtered through instead of letting people and children still play in. Beds are old and could also do with a clean and you need to pay for towels. Also Aqua park is not part of the hotel so if you visit there you need to pay for food and drinks and you can‚Äôt take towels with you. This is also in need of updating    Restaurant now this is where it get interesting if you would like vomiting and diarrhoea then grab a plate and tuck in. My whole family were all extremely sick as well as 60-70% of the hotel and management clearly didn‚Äôt care. We were told we were the only ones but everyone we spoke to were saying their family‚Äôs were also unwell and were being told the same old story from management. After seeing things like bread rolls being taken off dinner plates and being put into a basket and taken out the back (clearly not going to be thrown into the bin) it makes you wonder about the rest of the food which was repeated daily. Clearly they do not care about guest welfare. To be honest it is a total disgrace and something need to be done. When we did complain the only way they could handle it was to call the police instead of taking responsibility who concluded that we were not at fault and the hotel were to blame for making us all so unwell. Instead of facing up to a serious problem in the hotel they resorted to stoop so low and on what was our last day.  If management continue to run the hotel they way they are they will run it completely into the ground. Thankfully we are home but still not 100% but a guess it will take time.    My advice is if you want to see Marrakesh which is a beautiful place to visit with lots to explore stay somewhere where else for the sake of your health.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sarah18012811

Rude incompetent staff especially management. Tried complaining to the reception manager who turned out to be the worst of them all. Useless and arrogant and no idea how hotel management can employ him - Yousif in particular. So rude not even an apology for major issues with stay instead of admitting fault accused us of lying and then started to bully us. On the final day having had such a terrible stay and having tried for days to complain but kept being ignored I asked for 1 hour late checkout. Was initially told fine then just before midday was told room needed to be emptied immediately. Explained I just needed to change my children but was harassed out of bedroom with housekeeping walking in on us while changing    Genuinely horrible from start to finish. A few more details of the just some of the many issues with this hell hole. Awful check in process and left to find room alone. Horrible bland food repeated every day giving us all diarrhoea as well as many other guests we spoke to. Need to queue for ages even to get some cucumbers with people pushing into the chaotic queues and preference being given to locals ahead of anyone else. No WiFi in bedroom. No hot water so left to have a cold shower and poor drainage making bathroom flood each time . No shower gel. 3 towels in room for 5 people. Only get beach towels for ¬£10 each. No kids club or any entertainment except for same group of people dancing each day.    Such an incredible waste of money and time to visit this hotel.

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Simon & Michelle wrote a review Sep 2022,40,Family Holiday,We traveled to this hotel in May Half Term as a family of 5. We have 3 Children aged 9 7 and 6. Our room was clean and well laid out with 3 separate single beds for the children in a curtained off area of the room. The room was clean on arrival and cleaned well every day.  Bearing in mind it was half term the hotel pool was fairly quiet with plenty of sunbeds available and also cushioned day bed areas in the shade which was useful with the children. The pool side bar was well stocked with friendly staff although they did run out of ice on a few occasions.  The water park is very easily accessible and on our stay was very quiet not a single queue. There were restrictions on the slides meaning our children could only use about 4 of them which was fine. We were happy that Health and Safety was considered. there were also plenty of life guards around the slide areas. Please note that drinks and food are chargeable at the water park but it is so close to the hotel that this wasn't a problem.  The restaurant was well stocked as all All Inclusive hotels it can get a bit repetitive. There was no ice cream for the children but they were available to purchase from the shop or the bar in the evening. There was a large outdoor barbeque every day for lunch and dinner. Kebab station and pizza oven stations. The Pizza was very good the children said!  The restaurant did seem understaffed. Tables were not cleared very quickly meaning we did struggle to find a table on some occasions.  The outdoor bar in the evening was small but well staffed and a special mention for Hinda who looked after us very well!  Please make sure you take everything you need with you as there is nothing around the hotel to get any supplies although there is a small shop in the hotel.  We took a trip to Jemaa El-Fna which was quite an experience and not a great one with young children. We got dropped off on the outside of the square to the smell of homeless people and urine. I suggest staying away from the entertainers in the centre of the square as they will be very aggressive in terms of payment and lure you in by saying you can look for free. they will then let you take lots of pictures and charge you ridiculous amounts for this. They will stand in front of you until you pay. One of them literally took my daughter by the arm towards the drugged up snakes for a picture to the point I had to make him let go of her and man handle him out of my way to get out of the situation. I did tip them an appropriate amount for the pictures we took but nowhere near the ¬£50 they were asking! Reading this you may think we were a little naive but we are pretty well travelled and have come across these situations before but this was by far the quickest and most aggressive we have encountered to date.  There was a kids club but we did not use it as it was located right out the front of the hotel and nowhere near the pool area.

But this hotel was absolutely horrendous . From start to finish    We arrived late in the evening as our flight had been delayed and my son was unwell and crying yet they refused to let us to our room until we had filled out 5 long forms despite me asking if one of us could take him up while the other filled in the form    We were then given a card and told to go and find the room alone. We walked around for ages not knowing where to go. When we finally found it and went in to out horror there was PORN playing on the TV as we walked in. For a family room with 3 young children this was absolutely shocking .    I complained about this issue with 4 emails and 4 trips to reception yet no one could even be bothered to respond and I was left waiting repeatedly at reception being ignored    This was apart from many more issues  Awful food  Cold water so unable to even shower  One tiny bottle of shampoo for 5 people which was not replaced no shower gel  Among many others,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y6618TZsarahm
"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Julie wrote a review Sep 2022,10,Serious health hazard!!!,I don‚Äôt even know where to start with this review myself and my family have had the worst experience staying here.  The hotel itself is very dated the rooms are very large and spacious but could do with a complete make over. The tiles in the showers are cracked and there is mould in the bottom of the shower. We also had an infestation of ants in the bathroom.  The fridge in the bedroom was dirty and rusty you really wouldn‚Äôt want to store anything in there!  Only after a few days of arriving my party of 11 age range from 3 - 75 years all started to fall Ill with vomiting and diarrhoea we was told if we wanted to see a doctor it would cost ¬£60 per person. When we spoke to  management about us all falling Ill we was told it was only our family they didn‚Äôt want to take any responsibility for it. After speaking to numerous families around the hotel we  found out that it wasn‚Äôt just us almost 60% of the hotel had fallen Ill but management was saying the same thing to every family.  At breakfast we witnessed staff taking uneaten bread rolls and cakes off of people plates and putting them back in the basket for the next breakfast setting.  Someone left a Pooh in the heated pool and staff just scooped it out and left people still playing in the water without shutting the pool down and cleaning it if that isn‚Äôt  a health hazard I don‚Äôt know what is.  After numerous complaints to the hotel that they didn‚Äôt like they called the police in my brother-in-law on the day  that we was due to check out after explaining what had been going on the police concluded that the hotel was in the wrong and that the children and the family had been  poisoned by the food.  Some families that we spoke to decided to leave early as they could stand to stay another night.  The only positive of this hotel is the staff they are totally amazing and this hotel seriously lets them down!  If you want a holiday where you spend half of it in your  room with vomiting and diarrhoea then this is the place to go!  This hotel is not all inclusive you have to pay for the ice-cream and crisps you also have to pay for any food and drink you want if you go to the water park you are not allowed to take your own food or dink in there.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAK0418
"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Your Q wrote a review Aug 2022,10,Awful place at high price! Go somewhere else,We booked a week family holiday at the price of ¬£185 a night for each family. We went there with our friends with 3 kids in total in August 2022. To start with the check in will take you 1hr then they give you 1 key card and you need to ask for a second one. Ours and our friends one though stopped working in few days and we had to get back to the reception to fix them. The ground floor room was pretty worn out terrace doors didn‚Äôt close properly the safe was not working either. To keep our belongings safe we asked our friends to lock them in their room but their safe didn‚Äôt work either so we had to call someone to fix it for us. We had ants invasion in our room couldn‚Äôt leave any food as soon they would come to attack it. Wi-Fi is very patchy and during the whole week we didn‚Äôt have any internet in our room. Ok Wi-Fi was at the pool and at the dining area Wi-Fi was available in the morning and evening when ppl would gather there no connection yet again. Entertainment was the same all the 7 days of the week. Aqua park is very old no food or drinks from the hotel are allowed in there so you will need to pay for everything when you go there. Second day my husband started with food poisoning all night running to the bathroom. 3d day my child started the same. 4th day I joined them. The other family of our friends had a lighter version with diarrhoea only. So overall we spent most of our time with food poisoning in the room with no access to internet which made it a ‚Äúprefect‚Äù holiday. Most of the ppl from the UK who we spoke to had the same thing as well one even had to go to hospital and pay for the appointment as there is no free healthcare in Morocco. The food is served on plastic plates which sometimes are not very clean. The plastic cups for hot drinks are brown inside. The coffee machines are 20 y old so if you drink espresso it is fine but milky coffees are made with powder milk containing sugar so you l get a pretty sweet substance instead of late or Capucino. This way to get a cup of milky coffee we had to make espresso go to the cereal section to get a splash of cold milk and then to go all the way to the tea lady to top up with hot water. Hygiene standards are very low so no wonder you risk poisoning in the end raw meat is kept next to cooked one and it is called cross contamination though the staff tried to convince us that it is the way it works in Morocco. Kids club is mainly an old building outside of the main hotel building. Not very clean with an abandoned building and a pool next to it. There are few toys there like legos and few kids slides. No entertainment as a group activity was provided as we expected. Our kids were bored there pretty soon and we didn‚Äôt want to leave them there. The only good thing is the staff Moroccan ppl are very welcoming and friendly by nature so they were the bright thing of the week. The tea lady and man are very nice. So overall we couldn‚Äôt enjoy our time due to the sickness. And the hotel as any other business needs constant investment and repair otherwise sooner or later it won‚Äôt work any more. So we advise you to choose another place to stay in Morocco and definitely not this one.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yourq2022
"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",SB wrote a review Aug 2022,20,DO NOT GO HERE!! ITS NOT 5 STARS!,I have to admit I don‚Äôt normally write reviews however on this occasion I have to! We have just got back from. 10 might stay at Eden Andalou.  Please please read this before you decide to go to this hotel for your next holiday!  I can only echo what previous reviews have been about this hotel.  Food has been appalling at this hotel my daughter and myself suffered diarrhoea after just 3 days. Having spoken to other families on the resort it was soon very clear it was just us but they had all been affected by the same issue. When we spoke to the hotel reception about this we were told it was only us. To make matters worse we noticed the waiters on the morning service during breakfast picking up in eaten bread rolls and cakes off other peoples plates and putting it back in the brass basket! I mean if this isn‚Äôt disgusting I don‚Äôt know what else is! We complained about this and were soon approached by the restaurant manager who looked completely shocked that these things were happening and offered a spa day if we retracted our complaint!! Shocked beyond words. We then spoke to other families and they had also approached the restaurant manager and complaint about something similar they saw too!!  On our morning of leaving Marrakesh I was walking towards the desk and fell on the floor unbeknown to me the floor was completely wet (my trousers and shoes were soaked) I banged my knee. My husband spoke to the receptionist and showed him where I felt and his responses ‚Äúoh sorry‚Äù there was no wet floor sign! I will be going to the doctors due to a swollen knee!  Needless to say this was not what we expect from a 5 start hotel. This is barely a 3 star!!  Please save your money and go somewhere else!!,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sbhundia
"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",FNPEssex_England wrote a review Aug 2022,20,60% of guests sick with vomiting/Diarrhoea,Stayed here 18-25 August 2022 - 3 kids plus parents. Eldest son fell ill with fever and vomiting on day 2 - then passed out in bathroom and banged head on sink. Next morning I started the same then my daughter followed by youngest son and wife. We only ate at the hotel as went all inclusive. reception told me i was the only guest feeling unwell. Met lots of families at pool saying they were the same - some had granny ill in the room others had 1 or more of the party ill.  The hotel had a nurse who gave out free anti-diarrhoea tablets and dioralyte sachets. Nothing for the vomiting!  It was the worst holiday we have ever had - spent more than usual as it was a post covid blast for the family - regretfully it was a waste of time and money. Hotel charge 850 per person for buggy ride.  I wanted to book for 2 persons as a gift. Got the same in town for 900 MAD fir both of us - picked up and dropped back to hotel.  SCAM - we booked a massage/hamman for the wife but had to cancel as she was vomiting - rebooked for next day but again she was worse so I telephoned the hotel SPA and cancelled it altogether. On checkout they wanted 1000 MAD for cancellations fees! I did not pay - beware the scam.,Date of stay: August 2022,,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FNPEssex_England

The hotel and aquapark along with the pool are an excellent space to spend some time with the family. The food is a varied spread the rooms are a very good size and extremely comfortable the staff are pleasant and friendly. I particularly want to call out the two ladies at the reception desk Lamia and Asma who keep a very cool head even when handing some tough customers and who went out of their way to help me sort some enexpected challenges.

Everything nearby however aqua park side is not all inclusive. Staff both in reception & catering were all good. Rooms ideal for families. Hotel is situated outside of main city where shuttle bus is provided free. I suggest those in charge of catering BBQ or grilled food should thoroughly & checked prior to customers eating as had issues with BBQ which was not cooked properly & gave us issues. Besides that overall customer service & hotel is good.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jangaria

We have promised ourselves to go back and to take more family members with us. What a lovely family centred place to have stayed at! Lots of activities to entertain the young and old the suites spacious and very clean and as for the food‚Ä¶ so many different options all tasty!! The staff were welcoming anticipating our needs always a kind word. From Marouan in the Atlas restaurant to Saber the acquagym instructor who made our morning so much fun! Not to forget Ch√©rif the head of entertainment and also guest relations. He really is the backbone of this hotel in many aspects and made our stay as well as many others an unforgettable one! I could write a book about this magical place! Thank you to everyone from the porters to the lovely staff at reception the cleaning teams and of course the bar and restaurant staff who all deserve an applause.

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",S_W wrote a review Aug 2022,20,Not 5*,A satisfactory stay definitely not a 5 star hotel however I will start with the positives most staff are amazing and make a huge difference  special mention to Hind Faical and Usef James at the bar who went above and beyond for us and made our stay much more pleasant and some others in the restaurant but unfortunately I don‚Äôt know their names.  There are a couple of very rude female receptionists. Check in was smooth we were told late check out was available and to return when we had used the cash point to book it the following day when we returned there was a foreign message displayed on the ATM I took a photo on my phone to ask the female receptionist what it said and she just replied I can‚Äôt help rudely.  After asking one of the male staff he came to our rescue so we could withdraw some money we were very thankful but were then told we didn‚Äôt need to pay for late checkout until the day before departure when we returned that day we were told there was no availability rudely by another female receptionist‚Ä¶ But there would have been availability if they would have let us pay for this when we asked to!  No Ice cream included in the all inclusive you have to pay extra for ice creams which we have never experienced before‚Ä¶  Restaurant was an experience! Weekends were awful you are packed in like sardines it‚Äôs like a cattle market people pushing and shoving in-front of you like they‚Äôve never eaten before! Buffet style but you can‚Äôt serve yourself so have to wait in a queue and point to what you want often others that are maybe locals push in-front and staff serve them first even pushing in-front of kids we saw several huge arguments in the restaurants between guests some are so greedy with mountains of food in the middle of their tables that all goes to waste leaving nothing for others.  Waterpark was good kids enjoyed that. Much nicer than the packed hotel but you couldn‚Äôt take drinks from the hotel so that was a bit disappointing also.  Rooms were cleaned regularly but this is definitely not 5* more like 3* there was black mould around the bath and very dated.,Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Derby, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Walker_Tribe_Travels
"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Lucy L wrote a review Aug 2022,10,Week.from.hell.,Please read my review and actually take me for the words I'm saying this isn't just a one off opinion I am at this resort right now and I can not wait to get home along with so many other people you speak to here.    This hotel is responsible for making me my partner and my three year old daughter bed bound with sickness and diarrhoea.  My child and my partner were being sick every half an hour they can not even keep water down I ask for help from reception they send a nurse who says ' oh no sorry there's nothing I can do' so we then call a doctor on the phone who says ' hello yes you're going to need to pay me what do you even want me to do?'  I try to bring my child plain food and drink back to my room as she is too ill to go to the restaurant to be told no sorry if you want to do that you need to pay money I respond are you joking she is a sick child in bed they did not care at all.    Multiple complaints to chefs/ staff/ reception to just be met with people who do not care about you what so ever.    Everyone round the pool right now who we have got chatting too has either a family member who have had this illness or are currently struggling with it.  I got chatting to a man who got charged hundreds and hundreds to be taken to hospital to be told it is bacteria from food or the cooking.    I can not express enough how awful this holiday is we have no idea what to eat or drink as we do not know what is safe and what's not day by day our party of 8 someone is getting ill one of our party has actually payed thousands to get a early flight home me and my family are not lucky enough to do this unfortunately so we are stuck in this hell for 3 more days I have never ever said that about a holiday either this holiday I cannot wait for it to end.    I've never felt so unsafe from illness/ so unheard by this hotel/ so unhelpful all of us watching each other be sick so much we can't even keep water down and they refuse to except even any responsibility of any of this we have not left this hotel so there is NO WAY its from anywhere else i haven't even had a sorry let alone a refund which I will be fighting for I've never experienced a holiday like this and hopefully I never will again so if you're considering going here please please do not.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lucylU2111MD
"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Darren B wrote a review Aug 2022,50,Great family holiday,We are a family of 4 ( 2 teenage boys) this was our 1st ever trip to Morocco. The hotel was clean. We stayed in a Suite which was basically a large room with a curtain dividing the room. 2 beds pushed together to make a large double bed & another 2 single beds the other side of the curtain. The room was fine large bathroom. 2 bottles of water are left when the room is cleaned or you can ask at reception and someone will bring them up to the room.    Something to keep in mind is the tourist tax you have to pay on arrival at the hotel. It cost us in total about ¬£100 for 4 people for 9 days.    The food was lovely our children aged 16 and 13 certainly enjoyed the food. Yes it does get a bit repetitive after a while but that's no different from any A.I. holidays.    The pools were great the staff around the pool were very helpful when in search of sun loungers as most around the pool had towels on them by 9am. The Aquapark is literally a 2 minute walk from the main pool we all enjoyed the park and various slides. There are slides for all ages worth noting though there are height and weight restrictions on the slides. Again staff were all very pleasant & helpful. You are not allowed to take food into the Aquapark but you can take bottles of water. Your bags do get searched on entry. Also worth making aware of any food and drink at the waterpark is not included in the all inclusive package so you will have to pay for anything in the park.    There are various activities the entertainment team put on during the day. My 2 sons preferred the water polo and football but there was dancing ping pong darts aqua aerobics and more.    They did show football matches on the big screen. The evening entertainment was ok. The singer was decent for background music while people ate although he did sing a number of the same songs every night.    Which leads me to my only real gripe. While the entertainment team are enthusiastic the songs they play during the day and played again in the evening sometimes you hear the same songs at least 3 times a day. It's very repetitive and by the last few days you just wished they would play a different set. They do try to entertain the smaller ones in the evening and while it starts off ok towards the end of the kids section it seemed more like the entertainment team were doing their own thing on stage and dancing for themselves instead of entertaining the kids. The 1st night we were there they did all different types of dancing it was enjoyable to watch.There was tall guy with plaited hair in a ponytail in the Entertainment team I got the impression he was possibly the manager or leader of them again he was full of enthusiasm but only seemed to like having the same few songs being played and only had 3 dances he ever did which the Entertainment Team had to cheer. If he was the Entertainment Manager he could do with some improvement. They could do with changing it around bit. Maybe have themed nights. The only part different was the last hour from around 10pm -11pm when it all ends. This hour had more interaction with holiday makers and was good. Just a pity the time before that was the same thing every night. A minor moan really.    Just to note the bar and entertainment all stops at 11pm. You can carrying on sitting in the open area or lounge area in reception to finish your drinks but if you want a drink after 11pm it's all room service and chargeable.    Excursions can be booked from within the hotel. We did quad bikes camel rides and tours of the Atlas Mountains and waterfalls. All worth doing. The free bus to Marrakech town is also booked in the same office as the excursions. The people in there were very helpful. Worth visiting the town lots to walk around and places to visit and only about 20mins from the hotel.    Would we recommend and revisit the hotel? Yes we would.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B8775YAdarrenb

The hotel is large with generous rooms lounge areas and pool.  Our stay was made exceptionally warm by superb hospitality outstanding service that was above and beyond and answer to our every request by 4 particular members of your staff. Ismail in excursions ensured every member of our family were catered for arranging quad biking tour of great attractions around Marakech and taxi services for all our trips out. He was exceptional informative friendly humble and never failed to provide an answer to all our questions and requests!  Aimad from the evening team provided exceptional service for every evening meal. He ensured our table had everything we needed from the moment we sat down through to all our late nights. Nothing was ever too much and he works over and beyond. Salma from pool bar was great on every bar visit we made. She is friendly happy and created some great cocktails with a special touch! Lastly shout out to all your interactive animation team who got our family playing team games and stage dancing. Trainee Ismail was particular helpful and friendly always checking in on us.  I came as a vegetarian and I was able to find something to eat at each seating. The variation is large dining times are ample and outside of these you are able to find snacks such as pizza and pasta by poolside. The hotel uses local alcohol but we were also able to find British alcohol as room service and at the water park at a cost. Ice creams / crisps / sweets are chargeable but can be bought at the bar. Inflatables can be bought within the reception shop but were dear( ¬£30) however once bought our children used them all week,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/114neenam

I booked 2 rooms on a single booking only to be told when arriving that we wouldn‚Äôt be in adjacent rooms because my wife had a different surname to me - even though my 4 children share my name. The whole week was spent walking up and down the hotel shuttling between rooms with only 1 key each.    The reception staff were not welcoming at all barely a smile and more like reluctant acknowledgment whenever you approached them. The rooms are empty no tissues and no irons even if requested - you have to pay for laundry service if you want something ironed which I‚Äôve never experienced in a hotel ever before.    Wifi doesn‚Äôt reach the bedrooms unless you‚Äôre right next to reception which is plagued by flies as is the restaurant in which they serve you miserly potions making you return again and again with no self service for water or soft drinks which you have to wait for someone to bring after trying to catch their attention.    This is not the convenience that an all inclusive booking is supposed to provide and put a real downer on our trip on top of everything else.    I won‚Äôt be coming back here again.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/953mustafaf

My contact lenses had been taken from my room. I was told I shouldve left the contact lenses in the safe. (Why would I put lenses in the safe?!) I asked to be refunded for my lenses. They had me waiting around for over an hour and a half only to be told the general manager is out of town and that they cant help me. They told me it is my problem. Muhammad Mu went off to call the general manager and didnt come back so I have been waiting in reception for over an hour and a half and am being ignored by reception staff Sieda mufti.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/917munibak
"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Gloria K wrote a review Aug 2022,40,Marrakesh,This is the second time staying at the resort. It is a good family resort that has a bit of everything. The food was better with more options a lot of nice fish options. The flies in the restaurant did get annoying after a while. The room was nice and spacious. The outside pool is really cold but refreshing on the extremely hot days. The spa pool is really nice and the hammam was also ok. Spa services are priced very well.    You can book tours and excursions at the hotel as well as taxi‚Äôs which is useful if you don‚Äôt know what you want to do. The square is popular to go to in the evening as it really comes alive.    The only fault is that the hotel don‚Äôt really want ti accommodate guests before check in time even if you want to pay extra. It did not seen like they wanted to find a room available when we arrived early.,Date of stay: June 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gloriak43
"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",chezza131182 wrote a review Aug 2022,40,Honest Review,Back from 5 nights with husband and 2 children (5 and 10).  At check-in we didn't realise there was a tax to pay - not expensive but just be mindful. Arrived before room ready. Given our wrist bands . i packed swimming stuff at the top of case so we just whipped them out before putting bags in the luggage room.    Rooms are massive loved children's beds being sectioned off by a curtain. . Air con was not ice cold but it was definitely cooler than outside/. 2 large bottles of water left in room each day.    Lots of loungers and parasols.    Don't listen to people who moan about distance of the waterpark away - its a 2 min walk.. Take your bottles of water from the room with you but you cant take any food It wasnt a huge deal as we just walked back to the main hotel.    Bars - small. glasses VERY small. Ask for 2 drinks at a time!!! If getting a cocktail ask for a small amount of alcohol in them.!    Food - can get a bit repetitive but its like that at most AI. Tagines are lovely. Drinks at meal times aren't self service they bring them round on a trolley for you - this can be a bot slow but its peak season. BBQ outside for meats.  Take inflatables with you. They are allowed.    Entertainment is OK not as great as other places we've visited. singer nice to listen to in the background whilst eating/having a drink.  Didn't try the kids club as children shy. Pool activities are good as is the belly dancing classes dally.,Date of stay: August 2022,,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chezza131182
"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Bob S wrote a review Aug 2022,20,NOT a 5 star hotel by a long stretch,Check in took 3 hours. That is after pre booking paying deposit and email to check reservation before stay. Archaic check in system where you have to fill in duplicate form (all the systems in the place are 10-20 yrs old). Kept on being told it would be another 20 mins every 20 mins. So had to keep 3 cranky gets somehow distracted.    Wi-Fi was shocking in rooms. We had multiple rooms in our party and it was intermittent in all rooms at all times at best. Not present at all on certain days. Hence why so many people camped out in lobby.    Service staff are kind but at times overrun. Waiters at restaurant cannot cope when it gets busy hence tables aren‚Äôt cleared. They also don‚Äôt allow you to get your own drinks as it has to be poured by one of them. This is fine when it‚Äôs quiet. But good luck when it‚Äôs busy.    Unlike the service staff management staff are arrogant and unhelpful. Numerous requests on reception were unheeded. They just don‚Äôt seem to care enough to solve the problem.    The food was very varied. But just not very enjoyable. Bland some obviously reheated. Sadly you ended up eating the same thing every night as some of the stuff was just not nice.    Aquapark was ok. Par when compared to some of the water parks in Dubai. Could do with a few more attractions.    Entertainment was so bad it was good. The cabarets rendition of ‚Äòimagine‚Äô made me want to cry. Think John Lennon produced by puff daddy using just a keyboard.    Cost was reasonable but nothing was anything more than average unfortunately hence I still felt short changed.

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",MrsKristinaH wrote a review Aug 2022,30,"Noisy, please before deciding if this the best hotel for you!",Noisy is the first word I‚Äôd use. From around 10am there is music blasting around the pool and same at the aqua park. I didn‚Äôt mind when the exercise classes were on but it didn‚Äôt stop all day. Twice I complained and they turned it down but next day it was back to feeling like you‚Äôre in a night club all day long. Great if you don‚Äôt want to relax and have some peace and quiet. Personally I would have preferred a slightly more relaxing feel and be able to read a book but it‚Äôs so loud it‚Äôs hard to speak to the person next to you. Same in the evening the entertainment is next to the only restaurant don‚Äôt expect a peaceful dinner!  Such a shame as the hotel is actually ok rooms are a good size food is varied and tasty.  Be aware there are a few things to pay for not what I‚Äôm used to in an all inclusive!  Ice creams crisps second restaurant and night club are all extra. Also be aware the ‚Äòall inclusive‚Äô ends at 2300 so you‚Äôll start paying after that. By 2300 I‚Äôd had enough of the noise and was happy to leave!

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",AVeryHandyman wrote a review Aug 2022,20,Constructive advice and honest review.,Our family of 5 (two adults 3 children aged 9 9 and 7) stayed here for one week 26th July - 2nd August and here is our frank and honest review and advice. And what to expect.    Upon arrival you will queue for a long time to check in and once at the reception desk they hand you check in forms to fill out for all guests staying. You have to take them away and fill them out and then re queue again for a similar amount of time to actually check in. Our advice upon arrival is to walk past the queue and ask for check in forms before you join the queue. You cannot check in early but can use facilities until 3pm check in time.    If you require good Wi-Fi (which is free at the hotel) then request a room close to reception as service away from this area is patchy or intermittent. We requested a quiet room due to our childrens ages given the evening entertainment and our Wi-Fi signal was poor.    The rooms are large and spacious. There are not plug sockets by the beds and only 3 sockets in total in the whole family room by the tv so take extension leads. Cleaning team are excellent. Good level of hygiene. Air con could not cope with the 45 degree heat of the season but not much could be done about that. Take your Netflix Amazon and Disney passcodes with you as you can sign into the TV in the room although if your room is far away from reception your viewing pleasure will be repeatedly interrupted or distorted.    Separate bath/shower plus individual cubical shower and private toilet room is a plus for the family bathroom set up.    The two pools in the main hotel area are nice. They advertise there are 3 but they are including a postage stamp size baby pool in this count. Signs say you can't reserve sun loungers but no one pays any attention to that and this is not policed. We reserved sun loungers with our own beach towels every day and it was always respected. Water was clear and pleasant.    There is a persistent bee presence in the resort particularly around the two 'cocktail bars' the pool area and outdoor dining area. They look like wasps but are African bees. They do not sting and the staff are unaffected by them as they serve drinks swarmed in them which is somewhat alarming for young children and unappetising. There is nothing put in place to deter them which is disappointing.    The water park is a short stroll of 1 minute from the main hotel pool area. Bags are checked upon entry for any food or alcohol taken in from the hotel. You can bring your own bottled water only. Apples were confiscated from us.    The lazy river was so lazy it had stopped. The pumps didn't run for the entire week. We suspect they never do. You had to walk or swim yourself around it defeating the object of it being lazy. It was more of an aerobic workout river. It was also in a state of disrepair with the sides peeling off. The amount of slides was limited due to the small capacity of the water park. The videos and pictures certainly make it look more extensive than it is. If you are a thrill seeking adult over 70kg you cannot use the majority of the slides. You are weighed before many of the slides. At an inclusive resort this is a humbling experience.    The main pool in the water park blares out loud music all day and is far from relaxing. There are not 19 slides at the water park as advertised on the website and trip advisor. There are 15- which includes the toddler ones in the splash park.    If you go in July/august then the ground after 11am is too hot to walk in bare feet so bring beach shoes for the kids to wear in and out of the water. There are no bees in the water park as no one buys any drinks at the bars there. The lifeguards are very good and friendly. The children were always safe. Zak was particularly attentive and good.    Kids club was advertised on the website but we saw no sign of it whatsoever. It was not offered to us and it didn‚Äôt seem to be in operation during our stay. There were no activities laid on for the children during the day.    We read amazing things about the animation team. They were a constant presence at the resort very welcoming and friendly but didn't appear to do very much. They occasionally held yoga sessions by the pool aqua aerobics or a darts tournament or ping pong. Other than that they drifted about the place smiling and saying hello chatting to people as a welcoming committee.    Every evening at dinner two men performed on the stage playing keyboard and singing. This singer with a strong Moroccan accent had the unique ability of making every song from Rihanna Bruno Mars Ed Sheehan Sting and Beyonc√© all sound the same. The words and tune were indistinguishable and would have a fleeting recognition during the song as to what it was they were performing. Then at 20:45 each evening was the 'childrens disco' - a tortuous half hour of one female member of the animation team on stage performing dance moves to morroccon pop hits and classics such as Gangnam style. The music played every night DID NOT CHANGE. And every night there was a conga. Then on came the keyboard and singer duo again for another 15 mins before the 'Big Show' at 9:30pm. The 'Big Show' consisted of the animation team taking turns to dance about on stage and laugh at each other and then demand audience members join them in the makarena. This formula did not change every night for 7 nights. There was no performance no show no choreography. No entertainment. The pictures on trip advisor and their website of performance troops are deceiving. This does not happen.    The 'gift shop' is unwelcoming and expensive. There is no sun cream water or snacks to purchase. We went to buy our kids inflatables for the pool but the rubber rings were 300MAD (Approx ¬£25) and the pink long lounger 250MAD. Nothing is priced so we felt they judged us on our skin colour and what they thought we could afford expecting us to negotiate as if it was a Marrakesh market place! Take your own inflatables that you can buy for ¬£5 in the UK.    The hotel is extremely isolated. No shop or chemist nearby. I had to get a taxi for ¬£10 to find a pharmacy in order to get medication for food poisoning of my family.    The restaurant was an intense experience. It is hot in there and can get very busy at peak times. We liked the introduction of small birds that flew around which reduced the fly population.  Initially the food looks impressive and there appears to be a wide variety on offer. But we soon realised that it is the same every day. The only variety came in the puddings which is slices of cake fruit and ice cream.  The food is either the same (chips pizza pasta tagine grilled chicken) or is the same food rehashed and reheated into another mixture at lunchtime curry goulash or cold salad format. Food was partly labelled in the evenings but not at lunchtime which draws suspicion upon its content. Prawns are put on most cold salad dishes so not great if you are allergic to seafoood like I am. Our whole family came down with food poisoning towards the end of the week (Sunday) and as we only ate here we know it was due to the food provided.    The waiting staff were excellent. It is not self service. This can no longer be due to covid as no one wears masks. Taahj was brilliant and really looked after us. Drinks are served from a trolley by a drinks waiter.    We mentioned to the restaurant staff and to reception about the family's food poisoning and no apology or investigation was conducted. We requested further toilet rolls for our room because of our condition and these weren't received.    The drinks available on all inclusive is limited. They offer 4 alcoholic cocktails and 4 mock tails only two of which are palatable. They offer a beer red wine which is just about drinkable and a white and rose which would be best served on chips.    If you want a bottle of water you have to ask for it to be delivered to your room. They will not give you a bottle of water at the bar only serve you a glass.    The travel office is very good and offers great trips and excursions. Plus can organise your taxis and shuttles. I advise taking extra funds for trips to escape the hotel and restaurant.

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Adele P wrote a review Jun 2022,40,Not the Hilton but good value for money!,Hospitality has taken a battering the last couple of years so I am hesitant to add a hotels woes by leaving reviews that simply aren't fair or constructive. I felt like a lot the reviews I read before arriving weren't very accurate so while I'm still enjoying my stay I thought I'd leave my feedback as its fresh!    We are a family of four (kids 10 and 11) staying on the 2nd floor.    Positives  The rooms are spacious and well laid out. Bathroom is large and the heavy curtain separating the kids from the adults is a stroke of genius! The food is varied and excellent quality. Unfortunately some of the best dishes are regularly cold which is sad but a lot of the food is cooked in front of you so there's always something hot available. I've stayed in plenty of dreams and secrets resorts over the years and I can honestly say the food here is better. Quite something considering the price we paid.    Negatives  Its pretty dilapitated tbh. From the minute u walk in u sense its had its day. Ripped cushions in the foyer to poor check in service u are never going to feel like a VIP here. This is where Hiltons 5 star resorts excel. They skimp on the detail but u are made to feel so special u just don't notice. The devil's in the detail and its sad they've missed those here. For example they make u leave a ‚Ç¨10 deposit for each bath towel. Which is nothing short of hilarious considering they are totally threadbare. I wouldnt nick them if u paid me to! Finishes are bad everywhere too. Old carpets and lighting that doesn't work.    Overall impression  Marrakesh is not a cheap place to holiday. Things like eating out and taxis are almost as expensive as Ireland which makes this place pretty impressive honestly. You aren't just getting an all inclusive hotel you're getting free access to a well run and well maintained water park too.    A lot of the problems I see here aren't down to lack of funds but poor management. For example I booked a ground floor suite but was given a room on the second floor. Couldn't be bothered to complain about it but it was annoying. The minibar fridge is running constantly but theres nothing in it. There are plenty of servers collecting glasses around the pool but not taking orders. A million small things hardly worth mentioning but I'd love to work here for a week and sort them all out!!    Would I stay again. Probably not. Would I recommend it? For anyone wanting a great break on a budget - absolutely!

Massive bed and 3 smaller ones for the kids. Hair dryer washing line over the bath. We loved the large pool and the smaller more shallow one. It is a very short walk to the aqua park which is also fab! You have to pay for your drinks in there even if you are all inclusive. My little girl went to the kids club which she loved and was safe. The food is lovely and you can choose something different everytime they have plain food too pizza pasta rice mash beef stew turkey chips wraps. The cocktail drinks selection in all inclusive is small but fine. The deserts where nice but we did think they should have ice cream and pouring creams. You have to pay for ice lollies and ice creams. We didn't suffer with mosquitoes but lots of flies (to be expected). Even in half term there was no stress for a bed. The heat was 35 and a little breezy which we loved! The entertainment was not very good but we went to bed early my girls loved the little disco dancing on a night. The same guy sang every night and it was not great.

My kids loved the aqua park although they were too small to go on the bigger slides. The staff in the dining area were amazing and couldn't do enough for me and the kids! Especially Simon' who didn't let us carry a plate and made sure we have everything we needed everyday. The staff take plenty of care to make sure drinks when dining are refilled rapidly.  No empty drink cups left lying around by the pool the staff were straight onto that. Entertainment was great my kids loved it!! No idea what the comments are about rude staff I encountered not one rude staff from the cleaners to the pool security everyone always has a smile and a welcome.  Security on the hotel door is a good thing and should make you feel more secure that you are being welcomed and kept safe in your hotel and not just letting anyone in.

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",AH wrote a review Jun 2022,20,Big hotel - small hotel mentality,First time ever writing a review so that says alot.    No late check out though willing to pay - hotel was not even at 50% capacity.    All inclusive but if you want ice cream or orange juice you have to pay!    Going to the aquapark - cant take any food or drinks and the bars there are not part of the all inclusive. So if you want a drink you have to walk back to the main part but cant take it back with you.    If you come midday then you have to choose what meal you want lunch or late lunch and then you cant have that on the day your checking out!    Waiting in the reception area for our taxi after checking out with children. Its 30+ degrees outside. Go to get a drink from the bar but no you have checked out now you have to pay for your drinks!,Date of stay: June 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/627atifh

Without them our experience wasn't great. They where a great laugh and really went all out to ensure my father had a great 70 th birthday. The hotel is very lucky to have these people working for them. If i could just rate the animation team it would be beyond a 5!    We where in a large group and unfortunately where very let down by the hotel. Twice items got stolen from my cousins room so please ensure your belongings are kept in the safe or request for no house keeping. Be careful certain things cost very dearly which aren't specified clearly. late check out upto ¬£40 VIP bar ¬£7 for a bottled beer!

The bathroom was spacious if a little dated but having a cup of tea in the garden every morning outside our room more than made up for this.  All the staff we dealt with were helpful and friendly. The 2 standout bar staff were Hind who was excellent at remembering our drink order and bringing drinks to us wherever we were sat. Also Faciale who as a Madrid fan on Champions League final night was very humble when they beat Liverpool we had a good laugh and he too was excellent.

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Charley R wrote a review Jun 2022,40,A lovely hotel,We stayed here for one week with 2 children aged 11 and 9. We have thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The majority of the staff are friendly always offering to carry drinks or move sun loungers for us. The standout staff being the Animation team and Hind who was very attentive and soon learnt our drinks order and kept us hydrated :-) thank you to them.  The waterpark is a short walk away and we really enjoyed a couple of the slides. The weather has been glorious. The pool is a little chilly at first but a welcome cool down in the heat. The booths in the pool was a first for us with comfy mattresses and pillows under the shade of a little tree we loved them and made our pool days very comfortable.  There is a lot of choice of food but it can be a little repetitive that we find in many all inclusive hotels. We missed the baked beans in the morning but there was plenty of choice. We also missed having an ice cream station that other places have but the branded drinks made up for that with actual Fanta coke and sprite available.  The room is very spacious and the bed was very large and comfortable . Thick black out curtains were fantastic although the bathroom was a little rundown and the shower particularly could do with new tiles and door but it had an amazing power shower and double sink as well as a separate bath/ shower.  The tour of Marrakesh was very nice with a lovely tour guide but we won‚Äôt be going back to the Main square market after being hounded and followed to buy and pay for photographs we took of the snake charmers. Not an enjoyable experience but the rest of the tour was interesting with a nice trip to see camels and a traditional pharmacy.

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",John Allen wrote a review May 2022,20,Really poor service,There are some really stand out members of staff who really don‚Äôt deserve to be associated with this review but unfortunately there are more staff who let this resort down. There‚Äôs clear favouritism to certain clientele and a lack of care about others who just want to enjoy their stay.  The pool side bar staff are particularly rude and despite when the bar is still open claim it is closed meaning you have to go to the Sun bar. On your return you notice them still serving so you approach for a drink only to be told they‚Äôve just closed. Totally out of order.  The resort itself needs a lot of cosmetic attention with steps crumbling and some of the umbrellas using an old screw or stick to hold them open. There is also no control over people at dining time with guests freely jumping queues without being challenged. Obviously rudeness is permitted when it is all inclusive.  Really disappointed on my first and what will be my last trip to Morocco and if you do decide to visit the country please avoid this resort. The water park is also an added let down which was obviously the opinion of others with the majority of guests staying by the pool rather than walk across a road to the separate park entrance. Lesson learned and will research more in future. 3 star at the very most and that is being kind.,Date of stay: May 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnA197712
"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Ru wrote a review May 2022,10,Possibly the worst customer service ever experienced,The hotel customer service is astonishing! No solutions can be found for anything with out the one management person and if he is off you have to wait for any problems to be solved until he is back on duty. Which In our case is 2 days away! The hotel charged us to much and then asked us to cancel our booking which we wouldn‚Äôt be charged for and they would rebook but we have to wait for the money already charged to be refunded up to 7 days! And to top it off we have been charged for the booking cancellation which we‚Äôve shown them and they are denying taking anything although it‚Äôs in black and white on my banking app! So now they have almost ¬£2000 of our money in the air some of which they are taking no responsibility at all. The hotel it‚Äôs self is not a 5star hotel you are charged for pool towels and have no 5 star amenities In the rooms. The pillows are the worst I‚Äôve even slept on. The only thing I could say is the hotel architecture is beautiful and they are good with cleaning. Most definitely not a 5 star hotel! Oh and to make it just a little bit more exciting the toilets do not flush properly so in all it‚Äôs glory I would not stay unless you want a 5 star building with less then 3 star service.,Date of stay: May 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rs21_uk

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",George L wrote a review Apr 2022,40,Fantastic All Inclusive for spoiling yourself with drinks and food. A few negatives that hold back from a higher rating.,Got exactly what we wanted out of our short trip to the resort. Buffet style food all inclusive drinks friendly hotel guests and cheerful staff. The water park whilst pretty small was all you needed for a little variety during the day. Would highly recommend to families with youngish children or a group of friends looking for some sun. Had some cheerful evenings and some great chats with the bar staff. In particular a shoutout to Yosuf and Younis on the bar. Also you certainly won‚Äôt be going hungry. Snacks a plenty drinks flowing. The massage I had was good certainly well priced. The gym has enough equipment to get by on holiday. Perfectly suitable for a casual gym go-er. Guys and girls if you‚Äôre like me and the gym is your hobby. You‚Äôll have to get imaginative with the cables for your workout. Also appreciated the free pick up from the airport on arrival! All in all we had a fantastic little trip.    Few little things take away from the 5 star rating. I can imagine the food may get repetitive but for some of my group pizza and chips is their go to on holiday! Id also say there‚Äôs a potential for daily activities abit samey. The evening shows were alright for light entertainment but nothing brilliant.    The last 2 things probably the two largest. I found the beds particularly hard compared to the UK. Having said this I did visit a friend‚Äôs room and their bed was far more comfortable. I also think the reception could be slightly more accommodating we ran out of the local currency (many places in morroco are still cash so bring more than you‚Äôd think) but despite the hotel obviously being able to take card they refused to let us pay for our taxi that they arranged. Ended up losing a debit card in the non hotel controller cash machine a massive inconvenience all for the equivalent of ¬£2.50. I‚Äôd expect a hotel to find a solution in allowing us to pay card seeing as they were the ones putting on the airport shuttle.,Date of stay: April 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgelG6987QF
"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",P W wrote a review Apr 2022,20,Advertised as five stars. Really?,Arrived in the evening to be met by confusion about our booking made on their website. They advertise children prices as 0-12 so we believed our 10-year-old and 12-year-old would pay children prices. It turns out that 12-year-olds are charged at adult prices. It would have been helpful if their website was not misleading.  Arrived at our suite to be informed that the two extra beds would be delivered shortly. They were and Housekeeping were very quick with this. The extra beds were comfortable. It would have been impressive if the extra beds had been prepared before check-in.  The TV remote control did not work due to flat batteries and the safe did not work also due to flat batteries. The safe was not even bolted onto any structure.  We slept well every night except one when the family above us failed to remember that they weren't the only ones in the building.  It was obvious to see that maintenance of infrastructure was not delivered accurately with much paint splatter visible for example.  There was always much choice of food and plenty to offer for vegetarians. Avoid the lamb tagine as this contained more bone than meat. Warm food was also available in the garden 4 - 5 p.m.. The clearing staff are over enthusiastic to clear your table with a risk of having food taken away prematurely.  The terrace and swimming pool areas were well maintained as was the next door aqua park. Whilst our children spent all of their time in the pools and aqua park we found tranquillity in the orchard rather than around the pools.  Beverage service was slow during meal times as drinks are served from drinks trolleys. The only day I wanted a beer I was told to get one myself from the bar near Reception quite a walk away. I did so temporarily leaving my food. I think the hotel should abandon staffed drinks trolleys and create drinks stations for self service (at least the non-alcoholic).  My youngest child was injured from a defective sun blind in the restaurant. The hotel handled the situation okay but I don't know if the defective blind has been rectified.  We had a relaxing time and the hotel served a purpose but whilst it may be five star for Moroccan standards (which I doubt having seen Riad boutique hotels in Marrakech) it is by no means five star at European or Oriental standards.,Date of stay: April 2022,,"Harpenden, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WegenerP

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Honestlymaybe wrote a review Apr 2022,30,3 stars of fun,As others have stated. This hotel is not a 5 star and as long as you set your expectations accordingly you will be OK.    Accommodation : The rooms were well designed spacious and serviced well . However they lacked some of the common 5 star amenities. Fridges were empty no tea coffee or robes. No brochure describing facilities e.g. how to use safe hotel amenities and services. No flannels shower caps. Its amazing how these things are standard expectations in other hotels. So be prepared.    Food: The menu was rather repetitive. I initially found the food bland and lacking seasoning although this improved once a large group of.guests requested a spicier menu. No alternative milks at brekkie. There are good branded sodas and cordials for soft drinks. Bar staff are lovely. No ice-cream on site unless your willing to pay extra and the biggest irritation was that food from the buffet was often cold to tepid at best. They have a microwave in the restaurant which says another. There is another restaurant on site but this needs to be booked and ordered in advance. I suggest going out to eat at least once so you can taste real Moroccan food    Kids facilties: the kids.club is from age 4 and is a rather ad hoc arrangement ie there is no timetable. We often attended to find no staff or directions to unsupervised activities in the pool area. There are coin operated rides outside the kids club which often looked desolate and run down. Shame. The coordinator tried her best but the staff are poor and she was often having to beg the animation team to turn up. Pool and foosdball are at extra costs    Pool / sports facilities e.g. aquapark: the children loved the aquapark and it was often relatively quiet. Adults will enjoy this too. Just remember that many of the aqua park pools are not heated. This means that despite the hot sun many could not use the park as the water was freezing i.e. numbingly cold. The hotel pools are better. The hotel has a basketball court which is well maintained but no one knew how we could access a balk to make use of it. What an own goal. The Animation team activities are advertised on a board. Yoga is good but everything else seemed half hearted or ill thought out.for example kids disco at 10pm I know it's a holiday but surely the kids should be winding down to sleep by thus time.    Spa: was wonderful. Best facial and massage ive had in years. Staff are friendly.    Services: we booked excursions from the hotel that were lovely. I would highly recommend a trip to the Atlas mountains. Visits to the medina are also a must but be prepapred for a lot of haggling. Camel ride was a bit anti climax so best saved for elsewhere. If you choose to book through the hotel desk remember to negotiate hard or the cost will be extortionate.    The receptionist Lamia (sorry if I spelled your name wrong) was wonderful. Very considerate    The holiday was marred by some of the guests having an accident some of the children were cut by a dangerous blind in the dinner hall. This was brought to the attention of management. They offered no apology did not cordon off the area to avoid further injury or offer to mend clothing that was slashed by the blind. The parents applied their own first aid to the children. So unfortunate as it was the response to the incident that heightened the upset.,Date of stay: April 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Watford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Honestlymaybe

It is 2.5 stars or 3 if you're feeling generous. On arrival the reception staff were very friendly The booking in the system is quite complex as they need to take a photocopy of your passports the hotel voucher and you need to pay the room tax and 100dh for each towel. This quite a lot especially when you consider that they have 3 or 4 staff max on reception.    Pros  Aquapark  Plentiful supply of drinks  Rooms were attractive  Spa on site  Lots of food    Cons  Dangerous - my child got a nasty cut on her neck from one of the blinds in the restaurant - and she wasnt the only one!  No concierge or any orientation - so no clue given on facilities timings of kids club etc. We wondered aimlessly on a few days trying to find the kids club which appeared to move at whim - one day swimming pool another at the mini club room  The food became a bit samey after a while - only so much pasta chips and pizza kids will tolerate. The indian food was lovely but our party found the morrocon food bland. Also unfortunately the morrocon restaurant on site costs extra,Date of stay: April 2022,,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bargainsgalorecat

Food is extremely repetitive with lunch and dinner essentially the same. If all you eat is pizza and pasta you‚Äôll be fine.    Entertainment team are lovely but again of staying more than a few days you will have seen all the dancing before. Could do with some more live music.    Alcohol is sub standard brands and most of the time there is only one small bar open leading to large queues. No drinks are on the room unlike all inclusive in say Turkey.    ATM in reception doesn‚Äôt work.    Have to pay a deposit for towels that only cover half the sun bed so on the rare occasion the weather has been good it‚Äôs too hot to put your feet down.,Date of stay: April 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Camberley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lornam76

And because its far the hotel order you taxi egensi that cost 200% more than usual. The service is so bad and mean. The hotel looking all the time ways to f*** you and take your money. It is not a real all included hotel : only cheep drinks without food and candy for children.  The change value is very expensive if you compare to airport that is usually had expensive value os change.  For summary- don't get room there.

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Daniel B wrote a review Mar 2022,50,Second time at Eden Andalou,"We stayed at Eden Andalou for the second time in February 2022 having first experienced the hotel pre-pandemic in Feb 2020. As a returning visitor it was interesting to see the minimal changes from the first time we stayed.    We arrived at the hotel at about 9.30pm after a delayed flight from the UK. Unfortunately too late to get dinner in the restaurant but the front desk organised for some food to be sent to our room which was a welcome gesture after our journey.    Negative points first...    On checking in to our two rooms we found that the door lock on our kids' room was not functioning correctly and could be opened from the outside even when 'locked' from the inside. There started a farce that lasted almost until 2am with various people handymen the night manager coming and going trying to sort it out to no avail. No urgency seemed to be placed on solving the issue; we sat and waited for people to turn up rang reception when they didn't only to be told ""yes he's on his way"". Eventually we gave up and switched rooms with our kids so they could sleep in a locked room and we slept in the one with the faulty lock.    It was sorted the next morning while we went to breakfast. One of the day staff on reception tried to explain what had gone wrong with a video on his phone and something about the lock being turned a certain way. I didn't understand the issue but if it was so simple I don't know why it wasn't sorted in a matter of minutes rather than the hours it did take.    The second issue we had again with our kids' room and again with door locks was the sliding patio door at the back stopped locking. After reporting it to reception THREE TIMES and having to get annoyed with them they eventually sent someone to fix it.    I am pragmatic about problems; they will happen anywhere at any time but it's how establishments deal with them that really proves how good they are. Unfortunately Eden Andalou fell short on dealing with these issue in a timely manner. Even when I said to the front desk staff ""This is supposed to be a five star hotel your service does not match that"" they just looked bemused and sheepish and kind of surprised we were worried about security because ""the hotel is very safe""    My credit card would not work in the hotel's card machine. After calling my CC company there had been no declines or attempts to charge it so the transaction hadn't even been attempted on the card. I had to go through three different cards to get just one that could be pre-authorised to allow me to check in and I eventually paid the bill by asking the hotel to email me a bill to pay on their online portal (which worked fine).    The ATM in reception still doesn't seem to work with foreign cards the same as it was two years ago. It's owned and run by a Moroccan bank not the hotel but seems kind of pointless to be there.    On to the good stuff...    Beyond the lobby all of the staff without exception are friendly efficient and will bend over backwards to help you. The bar staff recognised my wife and I from our previous visit and always had a warm and welcoming smile every time we came to the bar. A lot of times we didn't even need to go back to the bar to get refills as just as we were reaching the end of our drinks another two would magically appear!    The animation team seems to be an all-new crew all of them incredibly friendly and enthusiastic. They would organise activities around the pool each day and usually drive the evening's entertainment but they were never pushy if you didn't want to take part.    The buffet restaurant has changed slightly in light of Covid so that it is no longer 'help yourself' but has staff who will serve you the food. To be honest this works just as well as self-service with the added bonus that the food stations stay much tidier and people aren't as likely to help themselves to far too much food leaving nothing for others. Each night had a selection of tagines and vegetables/roast meats with a fantastic salad station fresh hot plate cooking (stir fries etc.) and freshly made pizzas. There was often fresh roasted chicken and/or full fish served off the bone too. Desserts were always great a selection of delicious small cakes along with fruits and other sweet things.    The waiting staff are all super-helpful and will even have tables prepared for you if you ask. On our last day we wanted to eat lunch in the orange grove outside the restaurant and one of the waiters caught us while we were leaving breakfast and asked if we would like a table set there for later.    The housekeeping staff to a great job and keep the hotel immaculately clean in all areas. Our rooms were made up every day and always gleaming. Most days they were done by the time we got back from breakfast!    All the pools are still freezing cold apart from the smaller heated pool. This includes the water park which was only partially open in February and which has restricted most of the slides to a weight range of over 50kg but under 80kg which would exclude a lot of adults and even some larger teenagers! The four lane slide in the water park was also heated which gave a welcome relief from the icy water of the lazy river and boomerang/zebra slides.    For pool towels the hotel has an archaic system where you must pay a deposit for a card and then you can exchange the card for a towel at the pool booth. The deposit must be paid in cash and is held until you hand back your card. They will not just add the charge to your room which seems ridiculous when some people may be intending to spend their whole break at the hotel and may not bring cash with them. I had 40 Euros and 10GBP which sufficed for a deposit but if I hadn't then I would have had to leave the resort to find an ATM (because the one in reception doesn't work) to get cash or live without pool towels for my stay.    Finally on check out day (12pm check-out) you can have lunch only and then that's it regardless of when you're leaving the hotel. Even if you're paying for a late check out this only entitles you to the use of your room and not the bars & restaurants. This feels a bit mean spirited as I've always been at all-inclusive hotels where you are free to enjoy everything until you leave even on check-out day. There is also no courtesy room so if you check out at 12 and want to use the pools then you are stuck having to shower by the pool and get changed in the toilets.    So overall I've probably pointed out more negatives than positives but we did have an extremely enjoyable and relaxing week at Eden Andalou I just hope that the management will do something to address the downsides and provide a truly five star service to its guests.",Date of stay: February 2022,,"Redditch, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielbE4889ZA

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Nahima R wrote a review Jan 2022,30,Not a 5 star hotel,I only gave this hotel 3 star would technically give it a 2 star. This is my reason bare in mind we went in july its peak time    First of all this is not a 5 star hotel. Well i did not get the service of a 5 star    We came to the hotel checked in and it was fine but unfortunately my my other family member was not fine as their booking got cancelled and the reception staff was so rude to my family member and was not helpful. He ended up paying again for the hotel. Was not a great start to our holiday    Rooms was spacious we was on the lower ground floor was clean when we entered. Now the bathroom was not nice at all. The shower was not working and the pressure on the water was coming we complained many times but no one bothered to do the job properly. For a family this bathroom was not resourceful especially when you have a baby. They hardly provided towels and when we asked for fresh towels they refused. When asked for an extra pillow they refused aswel. The house keeping was very poor. The main lady the manger of the house keeping can only speak spanish when we asked for our room to be cleaned they never did the job properly it was very rushed and there will be days were they never bothered to clean at all. We had to complain so many times. Honestly I‚Äôve seen better cleaning at other hotels. Also they would not top up water it was 40 degrees and we had to argue for more water our room. The mosquito in the room were horrendous.    Food the breakfast and lunch was ok but evening food i did not like nor did the children they really struggled to eat so they only has pasta or pizza. They had snack bar at certain time which they ran out so quickly they served food for us but they kept give us tiny portions and when asking for more food they said no.overall the food was a hit and miss. The drinks was so annoying the bar man kept giving us adults in plastic children cups and we see everyone else getting proper glasses and we did complain but they kept giving us plastic cups. This isn‚Äôt the worst part the infestation near the bar area SWAP of WASP we couldn‚Äôt even eat or drink outside and not have a wasp in our drink. The staff don‚Äôt seem to be bothered about it but honestly was disgusting and frustrating that they don‚Äôt do nothing about it. Also they had very limited to baby highchairs. It was frustrating when the staff kept questioning wether i needed a high chair cos they thought my baby was older even tho he was only 1    Pools/waterpark was a few at the hotels was quite big we mainly stayed on the other side of the water park cos the music was better there. So main pool the music was quite dead and old music. We did ask them to change the music but they said the hotel wont let them. The waterpark pool so can not take any drinks or food there and you will have to buy drinks there which is so silly when you pay all inclusive. The water park was not all that. Unfortunately i was not allowed to go back on the water slide cos they said i was screaming which is so silly that is a normal reaction for a person. Overall the pool was ok we only stayed on one side which was the waterpark cos it was just alot better    Entertainment unfortunately it was really boring it was the same singer every single day. Honestly it was not entertaining at all. The animation team all they did was dance which they were quite good    This is my reason for giving a 3 star tbh the spa at the hotel deserve a 5 star it was one of the best spas i experience loved it felt so relaxed    Overall my experience of this hotel was not good my family did not like the hotel i would recommend this hotel. Beside the spa was amazing This is an honest review. I do also recommend googling other people blogs cos they have also experienced the same thing.  Unfortunately the staff were not helpful and have come across very rude.

We didnt get their names as they didnt have name tags but all the people on the front desk had terrible attitude.

On arrival at the Eden Andalou Hotel we were greeted by staff on the reception desk who took us through the check in process and were shown to our room. Rooms are spacious (useful for a family of 5) and are cleaned every day without fail. It was 38 degrees on average each day and there is a mini fridge to keep any items cool. Air conditioning is provided and works very well. Our arrival time was late evening and the reception desk had arranged for platters of food to be sent to our room which was lovely and very welcome after a long day. The restaurant has lots of choice for breakfast lunch and dinner and the drinks were always readily available (we were all inclusive). We found all of the staff to be very accommodating and nothing was ever too much trouble. They are always busy tending to your needs and have been professional at all times. Special thanks to the animation team who have been A-M-A-Z-I-N-G There are many activities to enjoy more than enough for you to find something that suits you and your family. The staff within this team are high energy very engaging and most of all always smiling. They are very friendly and approachable and take the time to interact with you. Our family has enjoyed speaking with all members of the team throughout our stay and we were thoroughly entertained both during the daytime and with evening shows. Their is a children‚Äôs mini club that is run daily which offers various activities throughout the day followed by a mini disco which entails lots of singing and dancing with members of the animation team. Our youngest Daughter thought the club and the team members were great to be around and loved every minute. The pool is great fun and there is enough room for everyone to relax and swim leisurely. Sun beds are readily available and there are enough to go around. There are aqua aerobics sessions water polo and football should you feel energetic enough! (plus many more activities) or enjoy a massage and a pamper at the Spa as my Daughter and I did. This is our second time staying at the Eden Andalou and the addition of the Aquapark is fabulous. Lots of fun to be had by all of the family. Plenty of slides or laze on the lazy river. Overall the service has been excellent covid rules are in place and function well with masks being worn in communal areas. Cleaning is taken very seriously and is consistently being managed. The atmosphere is great and we would certainly recommend this hotel.  We have had a fabulous time.

Animation team is excellent and went above and beyond to engage with families to ensure children and parents are well entertained. The evening shows were excellent from choreography through to costume design. Aissa Nounou Faiza and Rico were exceptionally brilliant!    Food is good quality with plenty of variety. Mix of traditional moroccan cuisine and European and American delights including pizza fries pasta and the freshly fried doughnuts happen to be the best I've ever tried!    Accomodation was good with rooms well maintained and cleaned thoroughly. It was good to see covid measures in place but it didn't hamper the enjoyment and vibe of the resort.    Facilities are excellent! WiFi is good 3 swimming pools by the hotel and adjacent was an aquapark which was included in our booking containing 19 slides a lazy river and a pool. There is also a cafe and bar at the park but this is not included in the all inclusive formula. They were busy so I assume the prices were fair.

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Priscilla N wrote a review Mar 2021,10,Nowhere near a 5 star resort,This resort is nowhere near 5 stars we booked it for 4nights/ 5 days for a family of 5 the first day we arrived I noticed a couple of common sense bathroom amenities were not being provided. We called the front desk and asked for a shower cap they said they don‚Äôt have then we noticed there was no washcloths for the shower we called the front desk they said they don‚Äôt provide that then we asked for an iron they said they don‚Äôt provide that as well at this point it was very upsetting that little things such as these that other ‚Äúfive‚Äù star resorts offer this resort couldn‚Äôt provide. We went to dinner that night and when we came back to the room our room was flooded with the rain that had fallen that night they changed our room to one exactly like we had except it was in worst condition the toilet worked whenever it felt like it the walls were all wet and it seemed like the rain was going to leak out the walls at any point. From there on we decided we couldn‚Äôt stay here for the entire 4 nights so we decided to just stay for 2 we spoke to the manager about the whole situation and he wasn‚Äôt understanding at all instead all he kept saying was we have to pay for 3 nights even though we wouldn‚Äôt be here for the 3rd night as a person that had traveled all across the world I have experienced many different resorts In Different countries but I never experienced the type of treatment we got from this resort the manager had us waiting 30 min to come out and talk to us to just tell us we still have to pay they were not accommodating nor understanding at all I would not recommend this resort to anyone it doesn‚Äôt meet the min accommodations one expects when traveling n more so the frustration and aggravation we went thru while being on vacation. Not to mention their food for dinner was cold and when we came for breakfast the staff was nowhere prepared to start breakfast!,Date of stay: March 2021,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/941priscillan

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",JB wrote a review Apr 2020,10,Terrible Hotel Do not book!,Trip Advisor does not have a 0 rating so I‚Äôve had to give it a 1.    Visited here in January 2020 and never have I experienced such a terrible hotel.  It was out of season 5 star hotel with very few guests so you would expect the service to be at its best but it was far from it.    All of the sun loungers do not have any padded cushions so are Very uncomfortable.  I travelled with my elderly mum so needed the cushion for her comfort.  I asked reception and staff they just ignored the request. It was a short 3 day break so time isn‚Äôt something that I had a lot of.  So on one occasion I used some towels from the room. I was spotted immediately and told I was not allowed to do this but yet the staff could not assist to offer any alternatives means of comfort for my mum.    I asked to speak to the manager. He didn‚Äôt want to talk to me but eventually did! He said the hotel do not provide any cushions and they will not offer anything for comfort regardless of my mums age!!!  ‚Äú we will not do anything its not our problem‚Äù he said.  I was told If I want to complain I must put it in writing.  The manager has no management skills or people skillsthey must of been desperate to fill the position to assign him.  I wrote my complaint and handed at reception.    After a few hours I had a note left at the room. Ive attached a picture if this.  It reads the line ‚Äú The hotel he don‚Äôt like your complaint please can you change the complaint or we will change for you the hotel‚Äù  Ive re worded this so you can understand the grammar and spelling is appalling.    I went to reception to get an explanation as this was a threat for me to change my complaint or they will change the hotel! After waiting around I was approached by a holiday rep acting on behalf of the manager who refused to want to speak to me. The rep was a young boy very polite but didn‚Äôt have a clue about what to do he just listened didn‚Äôt offer any solutions and never took my complaint further or try to resolve it!    Customer service is something this hotel does not know the meaning of.  Any requests don‚Äôt even think about asking.  The reception desk are ignorant people.    You can understand my frustration. This is labelled a 5 star hotel and they rip you off with the price you pay. It needs to be revisited as its not even 1 star!  Even the Aqua Park was closed.    Morocco is wonderful place and this Hotel spoils it.  DO NOT BOOK!

Hotel was fabulous very clean with maid service everyday. Rooms were spacious with a free safe hairdryer and mini fridge for keeping your bottles of water in and cheeky snacks! Rooms were a little tired but nothing too bad that didn‚Äôt distract how comfortable they were and clean. We did the All-Inclusive package and couldn‚Äôt fault the food and drink choices. The choice of cocktails was fab mojitos to die for! Everyday for breakfast they cooked fresh pancakes omelettes and fried eggs and the orange juice was freshly squeezed. Lunch and dinner were even better with a freshly cooked pasta station a specialty choice including kebabsstir fry and griddled meats. And the desserts were out of this world! Plenty of choice for all! The entertainment team in the Eden Andalous were brilliant and worked hard to keep you entertained! From 10am to 11pm they were busy singing dancing and doing activities you got tired watching them! Overall this hotel was a fantastic choice for myself and my daughter for our 1st girlie holiday. It made the first good impression when we arrived at 10pm and were told to go and have food straight away before restaurant shut at 10.30pm and relax with a drink before checking-in properly. Made us feel very welcome after our flight and transfer! We felt very safe food was amazing and the weather just topped it off by being so hot!

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Daniel B wrote a review Feb 2020,50,"Great Family Hotel, Wonderful Staff","We visited Eden Andalou in February 2020 for some much-needed warmth and sunshine while the UK was battered by storms. Turns out it was a good choice of time to be away and a great choice of hotel.    First off ignore the reviews that say ""Not a five star more like a three star."" as they're nonsense. The hotel is undeniably a five star although it may not be as pristine in some areas as other five star hotels throughout the world. A five star hotel in Morocco is very different to a five star hotel in Dubai for example.    Our room was a family suite for five which loses its balcony to create a sleeping/lounge area with three single beds. The main bed was two singles pushed together quite firm but gave a comfortable night's sleep. Air con in the room was efficient and kept it cool although the weather was mild enough that we could have the windows open for fresh air. Rooms on the side facing the aquapark are out of the sun for most of the day so will stay cooler.    It's a reasonably sized site with two pools (the smaller one heated the larger unheated and very cold at this time of year). The smaller pool got very busy with kids enjoying themselves whereas the larger one stayed pretty quiet due to the water temperature but sitting round it enjoying the sun was lovely and relaxing.    At the back of the hotel on a separate site is the Aqua Park which is a good sized water park with slides kids area loungers a lazy river and changing rooms/snack bar. During our stay (low season) the snack bar was closed as there weren't enough guests to make it economical to open. The main slides' pool was heated but the other slides were cold. Our kids spent a lot of time in here and had great fun even at its reduced operating level. There's also a football/basketball court table tennis & volleyball areas in Aqua Park grounds if you fancy being active.    The restaurant seemed to be busy at almost all times except for the very start and very end of service. On our first night we arrived at about 10pm and the front desk hurried to quickly check us in so we could eat before the dinner service finished at 10.30pm    The food varied between traditional Moroccan and western foods with both being available every night. Freshly prepared pasta with your choice of sauce was always available and very good. The salads were amazing and there was always a choice of fragrant tagine dishes each night. Desserts to my surprise were really good. My experience of foreign desserts has been generally poor; they look great but don't taste that good. At Eden Andalou however they look and taste fabulous.    The slight downside for the restaurant is that due to how busy it is the staff can be overworked and it can be tricky to get a drink topped up or fresh cutlery etc. The drinks seem to come out of a fridge and then sit at room temperature for the rest of the night and there's no ice available to cool them (unless you pop out to one of the bars). During our stay there seemed to be a heavy management presence in the restaurant perhaps in an attempt to improve the service - which it did - but the staff can only do so much in the time available.    For some reason the restaurant uses single-use plastic spoons for the desserts. Strange as the rest of the cutlery is metal it seems an easy environmental improvement to use metal spoons for dessert - especially as the bars all use reusable plastic to serve drinks in around the pool area.    The other option for food is the snack bar behind the pool bar which opens each day from 3pm to 5pm. It serves pizza doughnuts and a variety of savouries each day if you're not full enough from the other meal services.    Bars serve local spirits beer wine tea and coffee on all-inclusive from a limited menu. The staff seem to go easy on the amount of alcohol in the cocktails (or the spirits are lower in alcohol) so you don't get drunk and rowdy clientele.    A couple of small negative points: there was no information anywhere in the room on the facilities of the hotel meal times bar times the shuttle bus to Marrakech etc. Thus it can be difficult to get a handle on how everything runs when you first get there. Channel 1 on the TV in the room is supposed to show the guest guide but it wasn't broadcast while we were there.    Also as others have said the ATM in the lobby would not dispense cash. I know this is not owned or run by the hotel but if it's there as a facility you'd hope it would work. I managed to get cash from an ATM in the Medina.    Overall a great stay at this hotel and I wouldn't hesitate to book again. The staff are all so friendly and helpful from the front desk to the bar staff to the cleaners and maintenance people everyone will smile and say hello as they go about their jobs. Food is great drinks are good and the facilities on offer will keep you busy for your holiday.    And it's definitely five star.",Date of stay: February 2020,,"Redditch, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielbE4889ZA

Lovely hotel well managed clean and pretty quiet - we just missed spring break which would have been busier. Food was great - we enjoyed the traditional Moroccan food - although there was plenty of 'standard' food to everyones taste. Moroccan style fried breads and pancakes for breakfast and lovely aromatic tagines for lunch and dinner. The staff were excellent - very friendly hard working and attentive. Tipping wasnt expected but was always greatly appreciated. We had never been to Morrocco before favouring the Costas Balearics and Canaries.

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",larnerdarren wrote a review Feb 2020,40,Good family hotel,We‚Äôve just returned from a 3 night break at this hotel over February half term holiday. We booked it through BA holidays. We had 2 rooms 300 and 302. Both were large with a lounge area and a large terrace. Bathrooms with a bath and shower and double basins. The aircon worked fine. There was a tv and a safe. The beds were firm but we slept ok.  The hotel seemed very busy and most were families with children. We tended to use the restaurant early before it got very crowded. We found the food to be of a very good standard . I particularly enjoyed the breakfast and had an omelette every morning from the lady on the egg station. Very extensive buffets. We found the service pretty good . We tended to get our drinks from the sun bar and there wasn‚Äôt usually much of a queue. There was entertainment in the evening not for me but it was fairly low key and didn‚Äôt go on much past 11ish.  The hotel grounds were very attractive and there is a large un heated pool as well as a smaller heated one which was too busy for us to enjoy. There is an adjoining water park which wasn‚Äôt bad although I found the water a bit too cold for me.  We used taxis to and from the airport and this worked out at 20- 25 Euro. We didn‚Äôt visit the medina etc as we have been before. There is a minibus that runs there from the hotel. We didn‚Äôt use it so can‚Äôt comment.  All in all we enjoyed our stay and would recommend for a family with kids. It‚Äôs not 5 star by European standards perhaps. But we thought it was very good and probably better than we anticipated from some reviews. One tip I would say is do not change too much money. We had about ¬£50 worth left at the end of our holiday and thought we would buy some duty free from the airport but unbelievably they don‚Äôt take their own money at the airport and we had to use euros. Other than that no complaints.,Date of stay: February 2020,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Reading, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/larnerdarren
"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Lucy B wrote a review Feb 2020,10,Eden Andalou Aquapark,I would not recommend this hotel. Please be aware of a number of things when you make a booking. The atm cash machine in the hotel does not dispense the money when you request it. Secondly the hotel offers a service for a shuttle bus to go to the centre of town. The bus gets full about an hour after the desk opens so you are left in the centre of town with no transport and left haggling to pay a fortune for a taxi ride which is a mere 6 miles away. Youd think it would be very easy but it is not. The hotel will not put on any more buses despite numerous requests from residents. They fobb you off and say they will come back to you with a reply and three hours later you are still waiting for an answer. Not ok at all when it is your holiday and you spend a day chasing people.....,Date of stay: February 2020,,St albans,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LucyW442
"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Stanley S wrote a review Feb 2020,10,Very sad and shocking experience and very doubtful 5* star rating,The most shocking experience in all my travels around the world. Paid the hotel the full amount on 1st January booked directly with them. Hotel took the money right away. 45 days later we arrived but we did not bring the card which we paid with. So this is where the problems started. The hotel refused to take us in and asked to make another payment. After hours of negotiations they refuse to acknowledge the first payment because they thought that we defrauded them with somebody else's card. They did not wanted to see our passport and to prove to them that's my wife paid for the stay. In my whole life I have ever felt so down to asked for a first time money to be send from friends. I felt like so traumatised on front of my child looking embarrassed and like a day light robber. The worst thing was that we did bring only 500 euros cash and that was nowhere near the amount for the stay. So friends send money paid the hotel second time well they refunded us the first amount but buying and refunding on different currencies made us loose 100 gbp. One of the hotel receptionist woman was very rude and was trying to take the p....on her own language which wasn't nice. The guest relation manager was trying to be professional but with the hotel unwritten rules this wasn't the case. Rooms are outdated paint all over the tiles no electricity  fault with the canard when you going to eat in the restaurant your clothes getting stacked with food smells similar to that you have been cooking  no ventilation in the restaurant only 2 doors open.  went for hair cut london prices the barber did half job omg is it a 5 star. Have to wait to get napkins in the restaurant many times. But good things also the gym guy was nice and helpful all the cleaning ladies are very nice polite and hardworking animation team very professional  I forgot another shambolic thing swower pipe spraying water all over the bathroom no wifi in the rooms no hot water at evening due to high demand Currently in the hotel can't wait to get out of it.,Date of stay: February 2020,,"Bromley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/77stanleys
"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Ayshhh wrote a review Feb 2020,50,Brilliant,This was our first holiday away as a couple we chose this hotel because of the heated pools as we knew it would be warm and most normal pools would still be cold at this time of year...  We stayed here for 5 days and loved lazing by the pool and venturing to the aquapark which was just at the back of the hotel.  The suite was good very spacious and the beds were comfy. We did have a few issues with the air con but these were easily fixed upon calling reception....  There was plenty of choice of food from breakfast all the way through to dinner.  After booking this hotel I was a bit worried at the reviews some people had left complaining about the food and the entertainment rest assured this left me knowing I‚Äôd made a great choice as there was a lot of variety for all kinds of eaters including picky ones like me....  we had a great break away and were lucky with the weather given the chance I would definitely return to this hotel!!!,Date of stay: February 2020,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ayshhh86

BEST HOTEL HOST","Well what can i say arriving at the beautiful country of Morocco was a spectacular experience in its own right but the major turning point was the hotel experience that me and my family recieved i can clearly say its been the best! The exterior and the interior of the hotel is beautifula nice luxurious reception the courtyard area was out of this world so many area to lounge about and chill honestly best stress relief for anyone the hotel is cleaned with upmost standard the food buffet was really nice the chef who makes the fresh pasta noodles ""sorry dont know his name"" was really friendly and of course a great chef the rooms were clean but 1 thing i will comment is the design its outdated and the only issue we had was the charging ports i would recommend the hotel to implement USB as well as 3 pin charging ports to the rooms which can be easily accessible however apart from that it was ok beautfiul garden outside and nicely presented.    But my favourite bit of the review is to comment about the Entertainment team of the hotel all really friendly polite and genuinly good human beings the DJ Fozz ""sorry for mistyping the name"" was funny entertained us to the max and the bar tenders hasan i think was really helpful and my favourite host the beautiful Rosa she was so kindalways had a smile and always encourage to partake in a lot of activities i can tell she loves her jobtheir the biggest assets of the hotel thank you all!    I will finish of this by saying that if im ever back in Marrakache which i defiantly will be i will certainly book with this hotel Highly recommended.

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Sha-John wrote a review Feb 2020,30,Could improve...,So we had a week AI in Eden Andalou suites aquapark in Marrakech.    The hotel... is tired looking and is under construction with some of the rooms getting ripped out and plastered there is noise around the area of the restaurant but no jack hammers! üòÇ The rooms are also tired and could do with freshening up there has been some decoration in the past but sloppily painted that's gone over the nice feature stonework. The mini fridge was more a mini freezer it froze a 1.5 litre bottle of water over night!    Staff...the maid reception staff and all the lower paid workers work their ar*e off they couldn't do enough for us. The men in suits on the other hand were giving orders but from what we could see weren't doing much more there was way too many of them two or three on the restaurant door the same around the bar area and other places.    Hotel grounds...the pools were good the heated one a blessing as was the heated part of the aquapark. The aquapark will be great once the weather gets really warm you could spend the whole day there. The gardens were well kept as was the gardens in the centre of the riads.    Food... Was nice but not a lot of choice and was repetitive. There was traditional Morrocon food in tagines chefs cooking pasta dishes to order or stir drys. Fresh orange juice was being squeezed at breakfast with a single electric juicer that you'd have at home so there was a constant queue at peek time. There was an outdoor bbq at lunchtime but had queues again and sometimes more stuff had to be put on twice while in the queue the chef made things worse because he was giving some people full plates of things and others two things which I think is right so everyone gets something. We was in the queue and after waiting two turns we got to the front there was enough left for myself my son and a lady we'd met there and another lady who was in front of us only for a man to go to the back of the queue speak to the chef in their language and the chef gave him food which then left everyone short my son gave the chef a piece of his mind and the chef knew he'd done wrong because he tried to apologise!    Animation team/entertainment...consisted of one woman and about eight to ten men. On a whole it was ok but limited and done more or less the same thing every day. Night time entertainment was in the bar but we never seen it because they allowed people to smoke inside. There was no other entertainment apart from the animation team we've been to other hotels this time of year and they've brought outside local talent in like drummers acrobats etc.    On a whole this hotel is ok but not 5* I think the main reason it's 5* is down to it having an aquapark. With a bit of adjustment this could be a really good hotel I've even recommended it to my daughter who has young children. We'd certainly like to go back if they improved things we'd like to see the animation in the summer because they kept saying things were different then!

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",LAF wrote a review Feb 2020,50,Very enjoyable stay and booking again,Stayed here early Feb and really enjoyed it. Check in was a bit slow and receptionist wasn't very friendly but after that it got so much better because I couldn't fault anyone else. All staff were really friendly and couldn't do enough for you. From cleaners porters to Management everyone was friendly and always said hello. The request for type of room wasn't granted but I always understand that its due to availability and never guaranteed.  The room was clean and very spacious with lounge area for comfort which was nice after a long day at the pool. The bathroom was a bit dated and needed upgrading. For those who normally take hairdryers with you there's no need as the one in the bathroom was strong enough to use and I didn't need to use my own.  Food was always nice and plenty of it. Not a large choice but still a good mixture for all tastes.  The pool area was always kept clean and tidy and the animation staff were great. They didn't pressurize anyone into joining in with activities and Sherife was great and the funniest man to watch. The music around the pool was quite self indulgent by the younger staff members but they always listened and if you asked them they would mix it up for you with want you liked.  I will definitely be back and already looking at dates for later in the year.,Date of stay: February 2020,,"Wallasey, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lesleyflanagan

The High Atlas Mountains and distant coastline needed a full days trip to enjoy  however coming back after a tiring day was always a cinch .  Not once did the incredible vast arrays of buffet dinner meals ever repeat themselves with above average local salad bars multiple main course options and of course great patisseries if you had any room left.  Of particular note was the ever smiling staff in the buffet restaurant who diligently served hordes of patrons and conscientiously got on with it and the chef now and then making time to come out and chat with the diners.  Breakfast is scant but adequate and lunch was a similar spread like dinner with options of barbecue on top  however hats off to keeping prodigious amounts of dinner appearing in the half empty platters and making it all work like clockwork... particularly after a long day.  The rooms were large spacious and well appointed  suffice for our needs.

Wish I had as it is very expensive for what it is.  We arrived just before 3pm queued for 45mins to be told our suites were not ready they gave us bands took our bags and said to have a drink and come back. We had a look around the grounds are lovely had a drink and went back queued again still not ready. Told to get towels queued again. You have to pay reception ¬£5 per towel then take the receipt to a hut by the pool to get the towels. The path to the hut is not easily accessible very rocky path.  When we went back to see if the rooms were ready there was still a queue we asked a porter to help as we were not willing to wait another half hour he got our room keys and took us up to our rooms where the maid was still mopping the floor!  Not the best first impression. Our rooms had no hangers no remote control and the safes didn't work. One of the rooms air con didn't work and had no balcony furniture. No mini bar unless you pay up front.  The rooms are spacious the bathroom especially so nicely decorated. However very shabby the paint works peeling on most door frames the telephone in the bathroom had inches of dust on it the toilet had urine on the seat and the floor gritty. I scratched my leg sitting at the dresser as the wood was sharp.  The sockets in the room took 2 days to charge a phone the one in reception near the sofas took 2hrs weird.  The hotel shop is very expensive ¬£28 for a 200ml Nivea suncream!!  The guys that take photos round the complex are brilliant just ask where you want them to take the pics either in the hotel lobby or out front on the swing or by the pool even in the pool. We had nearly 500 taken and 99% were amazing all put on 2 disks and emailed for just under ¬£100 which we thought was well worth it.  The people on reception were not helpful at all most only spoke French. There was no one to show you where to eat or what the procedure was. The food was amazing lots of choice and most cooked fresh in front of you. The choice of drinks was good too however if you want a branded drink you had to pay and the bar was payable after 11pm. I found the drink prices to be similar to a pub at home (england) which I feel should have been included till 12pm and certainly cheaper. There is no evening entertainment other than a man playing a keyboard for a few hours then music played in the lounge. We were there for new years eve and unless you paid ¬£100 each to go into a different part of the hotel where there was food and entertainment put on which we didn't there was just music played which was very disappointing. The water park is really lovely but because of the time of year only one pool was heated which meant we couldn't really enjoy the full park but in the warmer months would be amazing. The hotels smaller pool is heated the larger one isn't which wasnt a problem as it was big enough for the amount of people using it. There is nowhere to go for a walk which is a shame. We took the free bus to the market be aware that the bus drops you a good 10min walk from the actual market make sure you ask where to go as you will get lost. The roads are scary and have no real order cars and bikes drive pretty much where they want to throughout the market too. I've been to markets in Agadir in Morocco but this was another level of chaos the men were very aggressive asking for our 6 year old grandsons food and demanding money putting snakes on you then saying you had to pay. Anywhere I've been a stern no has been good enough but there they just surround you. Not a nice experience couldn't look at stalls or products without being hassled. It's the only holiday I didn't buy a souvenir!

The people on reception were not helpful at all most only spoke French. There was no one to show you where to eat or what the procedure was. The food was amazing lots of choice and most cooked fresh in front of you. The choice of drinks was good too however if you want a branded drink you had to pay and the bar was payable after 11pm. I found the drink prices to be similar to a pub at home (england) which I feel should have been included till 12pm and certainly cheaper. There is no evening entertainment other than a man playing a keyboard for a few hours then music played in the lounge. We were there for new years eve and unless you paid ¬£100 each to go into a different part of the hotel where there was food and entertainment put on which we didn't there was just music played which was very disappointing. The water park is really lovely but because of the time of year only one pool was heated which meant we couldn't really enjoy the full park but in the warmer months would be amazing. The hotels smaller pool is heated the larger one isn't which wasnt a problem as it was big enough for the amount of people using it. There is nowhere to go for a walk which is a shame. We took the free bus to the market be aware that the bus drops you a good 10min walk from the actual market make sure you ask where to go as you will get lost. The roads are scary and have no real order cars and bikes drive pretty much where they want to throughout the market too. I've been to markets in Agadir in Morocco but this was another level of chaos the men were very aggressive asking for our 6 year old grandsons food and demanding money putting snakes on you then saying you had to pay. Anywhere I've been a stern no has been good enough but there they just surround you. Not a nice experience couldn't look at stalls or products without being hassled. It's the only holiday I didn't buy a souvenir! Been told you can hire guides that will help avoid the dramas  but wouldn't know where from.,Date of stay: December 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Norfolk, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/icklej72
"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Krish Pillai wrote a review Jan 2020,30,Nothing great to expect,Was informed as 5 star. There is nothing 5* about this resort. Wonder on what basis they have been rated as a 5* resort. The rooms are clean but they miss the elegance of a 5* resort. With broken floor tiles and unfinished walls the entire place has a tired look. Compared to the many 5*s world wide I would rate Eden Andalou only as a 3* / 4*.    So guys you may be booked in as a 5 star resort but don't go with that expectation and get disappointed.,Date of stay: December 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Krish_Pillai
"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Marie Trappehave wrote a review Jan 2020,50,A very enjoyable experience,"The hotel underwent renovations in November and the ""front half"" of the hotel looked amazing. The rooms were a little dated but are also getting renovated. The only thing that wasn't up to par was the pool bathrooms they were very old but at least kept clean.    The staff are wonderful and do a great job of making your stay as great as possible. Mustapha at the reception helped us out on multiple occasions and was always smiling and friendly. There's a free shuttle bus to Marrakech and airport transfer with a private driver can be arranged for a very reasonable price. The animation team especially Rosa Salim and Sherife made our stay so pleasant and fun they did a great job of getting to know us and arranged a bunch of fun activities! In the restaurant the staff were efficient and kind especially the manager the woman who makes omelettes in the morning and the man who manages the grill for lunch.    The food was great always very tasty and well prepared with a large selection and something even for the picky eaters. Desserts were beautiful and really good and for snacks there was pizza sandwiches pancakes and an assortment of donut-like cakes and bread all of it delicious. We were a bit disappointed for our last two days though when the number of guests dwindled and dinner was usually the same as we had for lunch the previous day but to be fair it is a lot more environmentally friendly than making full batches of food and then throwing half of it out for both lunch and dinner every day. The drinks are well prepared and the all inclusive wines were actually rather nice to our surprise. Their concept of coffee is a bit strange the cappuccinos tasted like hot chocolate with a bit of coffee but we ended up drinking a lot of caf√© au lait which was decent.    We had some issues with the AC in our room but it was dealt with swiftly every time and we were offered a different room (we liked the one we were in though). The towels and bed linens are soft and of high quality and there were very nice complimentary body washes and shampoos in the bathroom. Water in both the shower and for the tub could get almost boiling hot if you wanted and the pressure was good.    We didn't go to the aqua park but heard from other guests that it was very enjoyable and the water on the slides was heated. The regular pool at the hotel was ice cold (we went in January) so unless you want to do the polar plunge don't expect to go swimming a lot if your stay is during winter. The music at the pool was at a reasonable volume and never too ""aggressive"" (compared to hotels we've visited in Egypt where it can feel like you're at a techno party). We did get a one hour massage at the spa it was a wonderful experience and the prices were okay.    All in all we really enjoyed our stay here. I will once again highlight the animation team (Rosa Salim and Sherife) for doing an amazing job and making our stay such a pleasant experience thank you deeply for that. I'm absolutely certain that we will be returning to this hotel in the future and look forward to seeing what other improvements they make with their continued renovations.",Date of stay: January 2020,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/602mariet

This was one of the most loveliest hotels I have ever stayed in. The hotel decor was beautiful very friendly staff on reception and was always around to help. Every day our rooms well tidied and our bed lining was changed every day. There was a lot of variety of foods suitable for everyone. The waiters are lovely and friendly and are always around to make sure you have a drink and have got everything you need. The animation team definitely made our holiday fabulous. They came and greeted us everyday and got us involved in all the activities.. very friendly and easy to talk to. every night there was different entertainment run by the animation team who would always try and involve you as much as they can. Always up for a laugh. my stay here was outstanding and already looking to come back later in the year!,Date of stay: January 2020,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sophiekx
"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",Charlotte wrote a review Jan 2020,50,Amazing holiday for family and friends,I stayed 7 nights at this hotel and it was one of the best resorts I've ever stayed at. Upon arrival we were greeted by the main reception and our bags were taken off of us by the bell boy who even when transporting all of our bags managed to hold a smile on his face. The hotel itself was very clean as were the rooms. Every day we were given fresh towels and the room was always spotless even if we did leave it in a mess. The pools were also very clean and the heated pool also had a lifeguard at all times. At every meal there was fresh food and some was even cooked right in front of you. You were also greeted by the waiters when you sat down as they would take your drinks order. The animation team also played a big part of our holiday. They came and greeted us every morning and would do several different activities throughout the day such as masterchef zumba and water aerobics. Salim and Rosa were honestly two of the nicest people there aswell so if you do manage to book your stay here I would definitely have a chat with them. every night there was different entertainment run by the animation team who would always try and involve you as they would cater for younger kids and adults. When we stayed we were there for New Years Eve and it was honestly due to the employees. The music was good the drinks were good (but very strong) and everyone was involved. Overall my stay here was outstanding - the food was amazing the drinks were nice and the staff were unforgettable. I would highly recommend this hotel due to the amazing experience and already booking our next stay.,Date of stay: December 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlotte_wev

Christmas 2019","I am writing this review after our 7 night holiday.    I will start with  ""What an amazing holiday"".  A Christmas never to forget    Upon arrival we were greeted by the bellboy. He helped us with our luggage and transported them to our rooms.  The rooms were clean upon arrival and cleaned daily. Towels were replaced hot and fresh. They were fully air conditioned making it comfortable to sleep  The staff were very friendly welcoming helpful working very long hours and always smiling. They went above and beyond their calls of duty. A huge credit    The pools were clean the water was warm.  The aqua park was incredible. Something for both children and adults to do. All pools always were managed by the life guards.    The spa was brilliant. I had a full body massage. So relaxing (I fell asleep ) whilst the kids were at kids club (30 seconds away from the spa)    The entertainment was different every night.  Karoke night Michael Jackson night and lots more.  The kids disco was a lot of fun the kids learnt different songs and dances.  The animation team members were amazing.    The bar/disco  The drinks were lovely üòä  The cocktails were very nice üëçüèæ  The staff very friendly  They came to our table to take our orders. Along with popcorn and peanuts. It was very welcoming.  The bar manager ‚ÄòZam‚Äô was extremely friendly played with children/danced with them. Always made sure we was ok and if we needed anything just to ask. The hotel should feel honoured to have such an amazing guy for the manager and the bar staff.    The food was freshly prepared daily and some cooked to order right in front of you    Overall an amazing experience    I would highly recommend this hotel",Date of stay: December 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/subrinajoseph123

Our laundry was returned wet. The aircon in the room did not worked well and discharges dirt particle from the vent.

"Eden Andalou Suites, Aquapark & Spa",John D wrote a review Jan 2020,50,Amazing Christmas break,It was our first family holiday at Christmas and we were unsure as to what to expect and we were very pleasantly surprised. The hotel is just a short (20 minute) taxi ride from the airport. We contacted the hotel before we left and they arranged for a taxi to be waiting for us.  On arrival at the hotel we were shown to our suites which were spotlessly clean which was reflected throughout the whole hotel complex. All the staff were extremely friendly and couldn‚Äôt do enough to make out stay pleasurable.  Being a Muslim country we didn‚Äôt know if Christmas would be celebrated at all. But there were Christmas trees Christmas music and on Christmas Eve the kitchens put on the best Christmas spread my party all agreed was the best we have ever seen.  My party have various dietary requirements being Vegan Vegetarian pescatarian and various food allergies and normally going out for a meal takes quite a bit of planning. However we had no problem with the food selection on offer and all agreed the standard of the food was great.  I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel the only one downside was that the swimming pools were extremely cold but looked so inviting it was torture.,Date of stay: December 2019,,"Braintree, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F2100XXjohnd

However it is the staff that have really made our week here and will ensure our return.
