Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Colin C wrote a review Mar 13,10,High price and very average service.,In my experience I found that the Sofitel hotel in Marrakesh was not a good value for money when it comes to using their pool. They charged a fee of 100 euros per person just to enter the hotel and access its amenities which I believe is an exorbitant amount. Moreover I noticed that the prices seemed to be higher for Western guests which is unfair and can leave a bad impression on visitors.    Overall I was disappointed with the service provided by the Sofitel hotel in Marrakesh and I do not recommend it to other travelers who are looking use their facilities.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Zurich, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/637colinc
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,MJTravelsVIP wrote a review Mar 12,40,Great 5 star staff and hotel with some service improvement needed.,As a visually impaired person (VIO) traveling with a disabled mother the staff were fantastic caring and compassionate throughout. Although on arrival the twin bedded room wasn‚Äôt allocated at arrival although asked for. The initial check in wasn‚Äôt Ss welcoming no Moroccan Tea etc. Had to insist on our specific room which they gave but communication was an issue.  At breakfast Khalid served us and was exceptional such a lovely guy. Zachary‚Äôs also made us welcome and was very professional as was a lovely lady Emile. Hakim was also lovely and helpful. Breakfast was nice but for a 5 star would have liked more choice ie pancakes almond croissants etc. the staff were always very kind. The room service menu however was limited but ok. Asking for specific teas or milk was often hard work as lost in communication and had to often ring several times. For that reason I felt a lack of a 5 star experience.  I always ask myself as part of my stay whether I‚Äôd stay again or recommend to others. Yes for the comfort and kindness not for the dysfunctional service and believe that to be poor management. More staff better pay may help as the hotel is highly priced. It does need transforming to make it s total 5 star experience. On check out I heard another resident speaking to the duty manager about poor service so not alone.  Finally thank you to all of the staff again including Miriam who cleaned our room she was lovely and kind to my mother. From security staff door staff and breakfast crew you are truly wonderful and deserve a pay rise!

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Hunter wrote a review Mar 1,30,needs updating,For a high end hotel/resort I expected it to be in a lot better condition. It was great don't get me wrong. But the details were not paid attention to. Cushions on the patio/pool chairs especially at the elite diamond member infinity pool were pulling apart at the seams the loungers were badly in need of fixing dated rooms. The suite was very very dated. Everything was very clean expect for the dust from the desert air landing on things but that's to be expected. We stayed over xmas holiday and couldn't get a confirmed yes or no wrt the holiday meal and if they were having one. The cleaning staff were amazing and went above and beyond to help you. The front end staff were friendly enough but didn't have the added touch of making sure you got what you needed and often we found having to contact them several times to get things fixed when issues arose. With some modernizing it would be amazing again but feels quite old once inside the hotel. For the price I'd assumed better attention to details,Date of stay: December 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hn7r

The rooms amenities food and service are of the highest calibre. The breakfast buffet was out of this world with a selection that blew our minds.    We would like to recognize every member of the staff we interacted with including the restaurant reception concierge bellhops housekeeping ground crew and security. Calling out just a few from the restaurant staff--Rachida Bachkar Ilham Ibrahim Quorfi Hicham Nohaila Abderrahim Farah--as well as the concierge Adil (who selected some great tours and our wonderful driver Ali).,Date of stay: January 2023,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/639vinayd
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Inflexible wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Excellent Base To Both Chill Out And Explore,We enjoyed another excellent stay at the Sofitel (our fourth visit in 12 years) staying this time in the Spa side which just means bedrooms which are fairly modern and not in a Moroccan style. A continuing highlight from previous times was the incredible breakfast bar with a huge range of delicious options and wonderful attentive staff especially Rachida and her other waiter and waitress colleagues Backar Ilham Quorsi Hicham Farah and Zakaria who looked after our every need in an exemplary way.  For us the attractions of the hotel combined: a largish modern comfortable hotel with beautiful pools and fabulous breakfasts plus brilliant staff; located outside the Medina but within easy access to it also the modern Gueliz area to the north; and French owned - so there was a guaranteed minimum standard from a European visitor's point of view.  A perfect base to either chill out or to explore the sights at will.  I used the very decent gym for the first time on this occasion. Note that if you go and want advice you need to fix a time with Abdul the coach (who does not speak English) if you want him to explain the equipment. If you want him to help with training sessions he will charge for them. But asking him to give an initial explanation is free and part of his duties.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Netheravon, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Inflexible

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,wei z wrote a review Feb 2023,10,Horrible experience with the recommended ‚Äúluxury‚Äù private tour.,I booked a tour through the concierge at the hotel lobby. He seems ambitious and knowledgeable. He told me the private tour for Marrakesh is a wonderful choice. With Sofitel brand you put such trust in them so decide to do this. Starting by concierge asking for all cash payment I paid him $150 Euros. He promised me with private driver and private guide it gonna to be great tour with focus on history buildings ( I told him I am an architect).    The day of the tour starts at 10 AM they starts to drive me around neighborhoods outside of the Medina old town later on I realize this just to kill time and demonstrate the car is ‚Äúuseful‚Äù. So the guide took me briefly visited the Dar el Bacha then ask me either need to visit Ibn Youssel school I told him you are the guide he said it is very similar to Dar el Bacha. I persisted to visit it. It turns out it is unique and not ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù. The guide shows no interest to do his job as guide rather passing the time and get rid of this duty. After this he took me to the carpet shop furniture shop and oil shop even after I told him I am NOT interested in shopping. It was totally waste of time. I told the concierge that I am architect and solely interested in buildings and history culture it doesn‚Äôt seem the guide gets the message. After passing the market the final stop was the Saadien Tomb. I asked him if there anything else after this. He said nothing. I was surprised that the city has such little to see. But later on it proves wrong the city has way much to see such as the palaces and many other places. We barely used the driver and car and the guide showed me only three landmarks plus his planned shopping which I told him at beginning I am NOT interested to do. All this for $ 150 EUROS? I have to call it a total rape off and surprisingly enough it was from Sofitel concierge recommendation. It is a shame for such international brand as customer in a new place you put all the trust in them it is quite an unfortunate. I will never stay with this brand again.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Seattle, Washington",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/weiz381

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,d2jlr wrote a review Dec 2022,50,"Beautiful Hotel, wonderful suite and fantastic breakfast",Booked one suite for my wife and I and one room for my sister for 9 nights.  As an All Accor Diamond Member we were all looked after by a fantastic team in room hospitality and the breakast experience was superb even at busy times.  There is a heated pool and unheated pool at ground level which are both worth checking out.  On the upper level there is a Privilaged Area with heated pool for Diamond members and guests which is exceptional.  On occasion I believe you can pay to use this facility which unfortunately happened during our stay and resulted in 2 seperate couples meeting up and causing mayhem with shouting and swearing being their preference.  The hotel is not far from most attractions in Marrakesh and occasionally the walk to the Medina via the park is worthwhile.  One downside is the hotel does not have an Executive Club Milliesime Lounge nor provide the Lounge afternoon tea you would expect in most Sofitel's therefore the price is somewhat expensive for less 'benefits' but some of this ismitigated by the wonderful staff....look out for Fatima at breakfast she is wonderful.,Date of stay: December 2022,,"Aberdeen, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/d2jlr

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,kim t wrote a review Oct 2022,50,"Stunning Hotel, great location",We have been coming to this hotel for years. However this was our first visit since Covid struck. It has had a major facelift and beautiful refurbishment yet still managed to keep some of the original features which made us feel like we had come back ‚Äòhome‚Äô . Once you walk through the building you find yourself in an oasis with lush gardens and palm trees Spotlessly clean everywhere and the smell is divine.  . Set in the cosmopolitan area Hivernage you could not wish for a better location. Walking distance to all the fabulous restaurants/lounges and clubs. Yet within a 15 min walk approx are in the old town with the hustle and bustle of the medina .  The staff are amazing always with a smile . We would like to give a shout out to the staff of the L‚Äôorangerie restaurant - Souhayla Nounia Amine and Hitcham. A happy smiley welcome and fabulous food with great service. Thank you.  The concierge - helped us out in a very sticky situation with a fake purchase in a shop - going the extra mile they took us in a taxi to the shop. After many discussions I was finally presented with the legit sunglasses. Great thanks to Adil and Rida üôèüèª.  Every lunchtime we would have lunch by the pool. Great menu and wine selection.

Facilities: The facilities (pool lobby etc) are nice but the rooms need updates. No kettle no nespresso machine no brochure to figure out how to call the reception etc. tried room service and the food was poor / very basic. Breakfast: the hotel is huge so the breakfast is like a canteen with stuff rushing around no smiles. The food selection is ok.  Other: Had a blow dry done at the spa as well. While the result was ok the spa is extremely dated and dark. The hairdresser didn‚Äôt speak English and was absolutely not motivated to be there.  Checkout: had to wait for 10 minutes to check out with only one person ahead of me and one staff member checking out. She clearly could have called another member of staff to help or send me to another reception but she was just not bothered. This was at peak checkout time at 12. Again poor service and disappointed.

It took me at least 4 days to find someone who could help me with my group reservation. Luckily Oumaima in reservations and Zackaria( butler) were able to sort out the rooms with the guest names and to finally make my final payment. I personally had to be at the hotel to make payment which was ludicrous. This may not be an issue for solo travlers or couples traveling but it is a true reflection of the hotel management. I was also overcharged for a cocktail party for my group. For a 5 star hotel the management should be more competent.

The location is excellent and the property itself could be 5 stars but the service is 3 stars. The exception to this was Saed (baggage handler) who was absolutely excellent and went above and beyond to make us feel welcome - he gets 5 stars for his service. Unfortunately the front desk staff was quite rude unwelcoming and made us feel as if we were inconveniencing them.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Inder Raj wrote a review Sep 2022,10,Fails on multiple accounts,The hotel fails its 5 star status on several accounts.    We arrived at the hotel around 11AM securing a booking for the previous day. Upon arrival we found out that we didn‚Äôt have a room ready. Our room was finally ready around 2:30PM by which point we were completely exhausted and tired of hanging out around the lobby and waiting for our too to be ready. The room that was provided to us was absolutely dirty (bathrooms were completely unclean and had several stains on and around the toilet bowl and the floors) and the room wasn‚Äôt what we paid for (we paid for a king room with a garden view only to get a double bed room with the view of the outer wall). It took an additional hour + to switch rooms.    Another oddity is the fact that the minibar check walked into our rooms at the most random and oddest times unannounced. Upon checking out we were assessed $180 for minibar items that we never purchased. The issues took several minutes to resolve at the reception.    On the second day during my stay I asked the concierge about getting train tickets to visit Fes and inquired if there‚Äôs an online method to purchase. The Concierge informed me that there‚Äôs no such me thing and that he‚Äôll send a valet over to the train station to buy my tickets and all I had to do was give him 800 dirham (taxi back and forth for valet + train tickets). I later found out that I was exorbitantly overcharged - two train tickets to Fes cost no more that 300 dirham and there was a method to purchase tickets online. It doesn‚Äôt feel good to be hustled and duped by the concierge in this fashion at all!    Lastly nearly $1100 worth of items were stolen from us during our stay. I‚Äôve contacted the hotel several times and not received a single response back.    Beware when staying here.

The hotel is in the Hivernage district which is in the new part of town but it it also within walking distance from the Medina. The area where the hotel is has some of the best hotels and cafes the city has to offer. The staff is very nice and the hotel has nice lounges restaurants and even one of the best nightclubs in town.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Boston, Massachusetts, United States",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/466anasd

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Travis H wrote a review Jul 2022,20,"Hotel with potential, but beware billing issues and prepare for little customer service",Visitors with non-local credit cards should be aware that the hotel now automatically charges you in foreign currency but for a 3.5% markup. They do not ask like any other merchant would. In the current era where travelers often have no foreign currency fee cards it‚Äôs an unpleasant surprise. Staff informed me that the automatic conversion without asking the customer what currency to pay in is policy.    I stayed here twice recently and rarely post negative reviews but this otherwise acceptable hotel had too many basic fixable issues. Staff and managers do nothing to actually fix problems but will dig the hole deeper and leave you frustrated.    Also prepare to either spend time confirming billed amounts are correct or just not mind being overcharged. Value of a guest‚Äôs time seemed a foreign concept whether when resolving issues or just waiting for something like a drink by the pool.    The hotel otherwise is acceptable with clean spacious rooms that work for multi-day stays and a very large pool. The gym is what international travelers would expect at a 3-star but might get one by. Housekeeping are very attentive if you go to them directly but seemed not connected to the desk.    This hotel could deserve 5 star reviews but especially for a place operating under an international brand has a lot of work to do to be competitive. I would think twice before staying here again or recommending it to anyone else.,Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled on business,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravisHunnicutt2

No discount was given as part of the package.    We booked a half board basis for 4 people but it was for 3 when we arrived.    indoor pool has a charge to use it & No kids could use that.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Rajan wrote a review Jun 2022,10,"Horrific, shocking and disappointing - don't stay here!","I really do not like writing bad reviews especially as many of the staff seemed to be ok people. But it really is difficult to express just how bad the service was during my stay. We arrived at 2:00 pm 4 June and were asked to wait until 3 pm. Fair enough we went to the lobby waiting for the room. Service was horribly slow no welcome drink or tea. We got our room at 4:00 pm. I had requested a twin because I was with my mother. Unfortunately the easy answer is we are fully booked and we don‚Äôt have rooms.  I had requested a rollaway bed which was not set up when I went out to dinner at 8 pm. I reminded them. When I got back at 11 pm it was still not set up. I called them again and was promised: ""within 10 minutes"". A bed arrived very late.  The breakfast was a good professional staff and smiling during the service when I‚Äôm back from my breakfast I found out that my rollaway bed is gone. really I fell myself in a tent not 5 Start Hotel.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Hena P wrote a review Jun 2022,10,"Awful experience, terrible customer service , disrespectful staff, poor food choices, not five star hotel","We decided to book the sofitel after reading the reviews.    The first thing when we arrived was we were not offered any drinks or refreshments however people arriving at the same time as us were offered these.    We had booked three rooms for our holiday. Upon arrival they were trying to put myself in a connecting room to my parents who were celebrating their anniversary. The receptionist was very rude and stated that we could have the door locked for the duration of my stay. If I wanted to have a connecting room to my parents I would have booked that or stated it in the special requests.    Check in was meant to be at 15:00 yet one of the three rooms was not available till 16:30 and even then the housekeeping was coming into the room to put towels and water bottles.    On the morning of the next day myself and my sister in law woke up to none of the bathroom lights working in both rooms. We tried to phone reception through the phone provided in the rooms and they were not picking up. Upon which I came downstairs and spoke to the gentlemen at reception who informed me the technician would not be available until 9am when he starts work the time at the moment in question was 8am. So I was expected to have showers in the dark. I had to request the gentlemen at reception to have someone come to my room to check the lights before then to which the guy who came said the lights ""had to be charged"". We complained to the hotel manager Marianne about this and she did provide us with 4 spa massages as a good will gesture. There was five of us on the holiday.    During out 6 day stay majority of the time was spent at reception trying to sort out rhe various problems we were facing. Please bare in mind if booking this place you will face ridiculously long queues at reception and even when you manage to speak to someone they will be beyond rude.    Within the hotel there are four lifts half of which do not work. The doors within the lift do not open if there is a presence at the door so if being crushed by lift doors is what you want from a holiday then this is the place for you.    On the last day of our holiday our flight was at 10pm so we spoke to the hotel assistant manager the evening before whose name was Mariamme to ask if we could have our lunch on day of departure included within our half board. As we had not spent anywhere near our allowance during any of the days we were staying there She said that was fine. The morning on day of departure we had a conversation with her within which she stated that she had told the L'oasis resturant that we would be having lunch within our half board.    When it got to lunchtime we went to the L'oasis restaurant. Every single day this is the location we had lunch as within our hotel deal we had a half board offer. Bare in mind if you go for the half board deal with this hotel you do not get any drinks included within the allowance you get. Not even water so be prepared to pay for all beverages despite paying very large amount for the hotel stay.    Every day the service within the L'oasis bar was slow and delayed we would have to request every thing twice if not more times before it arrived. On the last day as they believed we were paying customers the service provided was quick efficient and very sweet. Abdelulah the resturant manager in particular changed over the level of service provided on the last day.    After our last lunch abdelulah told us to come with him to reception as it turnt out our lunch on day of departure was not included. The manager we had spoken to in order to confirm our lunch was included within the half board offer had left due to sickness. However when we messaged the number she gave us she replied back saying she was in meetings all day. We spoke to multiple members at reception including sukena and imen who all said that it was a misunderstanding that the manager said our lunch was included and forced us to pay for the bill as otherwise they would automatically debit the card we provided them during check in. Why we had to pay for lunch despite there being a misunderstanding on the manager part is unbelievable especially as we never used the full allowance on any of the days.    If you are booking the hotel due to the infinity pool the pool will not be ready until September due to some brick work problems which was another misleading advertisement on their website. The main reason for why we booked this hotel was due to the infinity pool upon arrival we were told that it was out of bounds.    On checkout they were trying to charge us for drinks out of the mini bar when we have not drank any of the drinks within the mini bar. We would walk over to Carrefour the supermarket 10min away and buy our drinks from the day. Despite this they charged us for mini bar drinks even after persistently saying we had not drank any of the bottles or drinks within the bar. The hotel staff members were so rude and abnoxious I have never experienced coming to a 5 star hotel and having to pay for drinks that we have not used.    Overall if you prefer your holiday to be spent in the hotel reception speaking to unhelpful and extremely rude receptionists. Who all stand in a line speaking about you and the issues you are facing instead of helping. With lifts and facilities which do not work. Along with restaurants which offer very limited vegetarian options then this is the hotel for you.    If you would actually like to receive the 5 star service you have paid for then this is not the hotel for you. If I could offer them less stars than a 1 I would as this hotel has completly ruined our holiday.",Date of stay: June 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/954henap

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Robert L wrote a review Jun 2022,30,A mixed experience,Stayed in June 2022. First time in Marrakesh. Some positives but lots of negatives with the hotel.    Negatives:    1. Check-in was chaotic. The woman that checked us in was helpful but some male colleagues were very rude and disinterested. Check-in was very busy because the reception in the sister hotel was closed.  2. On two days the pool was extremely busy partly because people were reserving large numbers of loungers from 7 am (against hotel policy). I also wasn't aware that the hotel offered day passes to the pool for non-residents. Had I known this I probably won't have booked this hotel.  3. No designated non-smoking areas by the pool in the external restaurant or the external bars. I also noticed two people smoking inside and not being challenged by hotel staff including vaping by the internal breakfast buffet  4. The hotel restaurant was nice with the live band but service was dismal. Simply too few trained waiters.  5. I booked the hotel car to take us to the airport but reception failed to act on it which meant the transportation desk knew nothing about it. Took ages to resolve.    Positives:    1. Despite being crowded the pools were nice and clean  2. The spa was good but expensive and heavy emphasis on upselling products  3. The breakfast buffet was good  4. The superior room was a good size with a nice balcony  5. The hotel is about 25 minutes walk to the medina so no need for taxis    Overall for the cost the hotel is OK but if you want good service go elsewhere.,Date of stay: June 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S9646SXrobertl

Upon arrival to the hotel at 7:00pm the reception staff at turtle pace provided us with terrible disgusting rooms overlooking the hotel's Airconditioning compressors and claimed these were superior rooms? They are nothing but inferior rooms unfit for any guest.    We were it informed that the hotel was undergoing renovation and that we had to check in from a second side lobby? Any hotel that respects its guests should clearly state on their website and on all hotel search engines that renovation work was undergoing. The Sofitel did not even bother to leave an apology letter in the rooms to make up for the inconvenience their renovation has caused etc.    All group members complained that they cannot reach the reception or concierge or housekeeping or telephone operator from their rooms as all those departments simply DO NOT answer their phones.    If a guest staying at the Sofitel Marrakech is facing any kind of trouble or has a fire in their room - who cares?

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,James R wrote a review Apr 2022,30,A little mixed,We chose the Sofitel due to its location and ratings. I have stayed in several before including the Heathrow one the night before traveling to Marrakesh with BA.  There are some great aspects to the hotel but also some let downs.  Positives  - the location is really handy for the old town.  - rooms are large and very comfortable.  - the room was cleaned and towels replaced every day to a great standard.  - some staff are very helpful and friendly. My French is okay.. but staff speak English very well.  - the pool area is lovely.. thick beds and bar service.  Negatives  - check in was awful. No advice as to where anything was.. no guidance to check out times.. breakfast times. No offer of tours or advice on exploring Marrakesh.  - getting to the pool was through a restaurant area (often with groups eating.. which felt rude) or through a fire door with temporary stairs with scaffolding it was really confusing as with such an amazing pool and clearly scope to open up the reception area it would improve the feel of the hotel which felt dark and enclosed.  - lots of staff around but service was generally slow and poor.. one morning we asked 3 members of staff for a coffee and after 40mins gave up.  To sum up‚Ä¶ it was all a bit confusing‚Ä¶ the hotel has the potential to be amazing‚Ä¶ the rooms cleaning staff and pool area are 5 star.. but the service by waiters and reception/concierge is 3 star at best.,Date of stay: April 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Wakefield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesrX6907CM

Calling reception for 25 minutes without an answer and being obliged to go down to ask for an iron was some of the things we faced  - the legendary Sofitel top-bedding is definitely not there anymore instead a blanket in a pouch delivers a very average sleeping experience‚Ä¶  - reading here some people are happy with the view. Definitely not our case with the 460->470 rooms facing an amazing double Parking space. Definitely not Marrakexh vibes. Be careful with the room you get and if you‚Äôre nice like us and too lazy to complain you‚Äôll get a poor view room for sure‚Ä¶  - the kids club is a joke don‚Äôt go with kids if you expect them to spend some time there or if they like kid‚Äôs clubs. They (4 and 8) both complained after 15mn about the lack of activities the darkness of the place and asked us to take them to the four seasons or fairmont ones their favorite in Marrakech. Also it closed too early at 16:00 on Saturday while it‚Äôs supposed to close later  - last but not least someone from the hotel entered our rooms yesterday night while we weren‚Äôt there and while our kids were sleeping with their nanny at 9:30pm scared them shortened our evening (we were out dining and came back as kids were crying) so basically made our date night out a complete failure‚Ä¶  Won‚Äôt step into this hotel again for sure and don‚Äôt if you expect a quality experience you‚Äôve got much better options in the city,Date of stay: March 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DayTrip53171689975

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,G Mhee wrote a review Feb 2022,50,Safe and attentive service,This was a wonderful visit. We had a very scary start to our time in Marrakech and ended up staying at the Sofitel last minute. We were looked after immediately. We met the concierge Reda who provided excellent restaurant recommendations. The other concierge (apologies did not catch his name) set us up with a local guide Ahmen/Ahmed who took us around very safely. He gave us some lovely information about the local setting and history. The facilities were great with only a few issues that were immediately resolved. All in all it very much saved our experience of Marrakech and would stay again.,Date of stay: February 2022,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GMHEE

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,L'aquila wrote a review Nov 2021,50,Amazing experience,The hotel is situated at a convenient location with an easy access to many places. The old city is at a walking distance where you can plan all your touristic and shopping activities.  The check in and out speeds are efficient. We came early for the check in and had to wait a little for the room to be ready while enjoying a welcome drink.  The room is big clean and cozy. All local touches were supported with a dark ambience. The sleeping comfort was excellent. The room has a balcony facing the fool or the city depending on your reservation.  The restaurant is amazing with all kinds of tastes for the breakfast.  The only disturbing point was the sound of a local music which is playing 16hrs a day I believe all around the hotel which is hearable from the room during midnight and also early in the morning.  There are 3 pools serving the guests. The colour selection of the poolside stuff are motivating you for a stay.  I suggest for all occasions and will come back definitely.,Date of stay: November 2021,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Laquila

Excellent service at the restaurant but slow and completely inefficient service at the front desk concierge and luggage handling.  During the French school holiday the hotel ground looks and feel like an overbooked club M√©diterran√©e resort with a completely saturated pool area not a single seating available and scarce and humid towels. Obviously the hotel accepts ¬´ day guests ¬ª instead of caring for it‚Äôs resident guests.  Do not accept rooms on the streets they are very noisy from traffic.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Rhys A wrote a review Aug 2021,30,Miss and hit,Unfortunately not the best of experience. Property is nice with good location. Pool at rear of the hotel is quite nice.    The service is very poor and unless you speak french or local language its a issue. The rooms are not cleaned unless you ring reception which eventually gets very frustrating. You are not allowed to bring any soft drinks or food into the hotel. It you have young kids please bare this in mind. The pool staff are very poor.    Around the pool to get anyone attention is hard work maybe under staffed not sure but the hotel wasnt busy. If you order food around the pool be patient as very very slow.    Concierge service are very helpful as are the reception staff. Breakfast is good as is the service.    Overall i would give 5/6 out of 10 for all over experience of the hotel.

Don‚Äôt be fooled by this hotels surprising reviews because it is just BAD. Bad service Rude Staff who have not clue. Try ordering something and you get passed from one staff to the other because no one wants to do their job. It‚Äôs just a JOKE. STAFF DONT WANT TO WORK SO you pay for service but no one to give you service. It‚Äôs ridiculous. Staff are just waiting for tips and when you tip them that‚Äôs the end. No more service. The staff Farah - Who kept coughing and grunting at breakfast buffet. How disgusting. It‚Äôs better to go to the bathroom and grunt until you‚Äôre throat is clear than to do this for 1 hours at breakfast - especially during Covid season. This is common teaching that you don‚Äôt grunt continuously at food/restaurants. And when we informed her manager because it was obviously unappealing someone coughing out cataar when you are eat for over an hour she gets upset and won‚Äôt serve us and won‚Äôt do her job. I mean honestly so your job. I‚Äôm not here to be your friend pleaSe do your job! The service at lunch by the pool is appalling. Staff keep passing the job to other staff and you end up getting no service. This hotel is to be avoided. The new bald head security guy is so rude. I mean I am your guest and a paying guest.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,AmaanH wrote a review Nov 2020,10,Poor quality- very disappointed.,Checked in today after a long journey and I'm regretting booking the hotel. The rooms are not in great condition for a five star hotel carpet burn marks and in general do not have the feel of a luxury hotel. They feel unclean and dusty and when you take into consideration the current climate - it makes you feel uneasy.    By booking one of the most renowned hotels in Marrakech you would expect much better quality. Not particularly looking forward to the next five days - may even consider moving to a different hotel.    There pictures presented in the site and the actual 2 rooms we are occupying do not look the same. It's difficult to get away in such testing times - and after a long journey to say I'm dissatisfied is an understatement.

I asked for a cot for my baby they could not provide it after an hour and a half ( being tired and with all what happened i asked them just to ignore it because the baby was already asleep). Last but not least as i'am an accord frequent client i've used points to pay for my stay which they don't know how to handle. The points were deducted from my account at the time of booking. I was surprised at the check out with a totally different amount to pay they did not take into consideration my points. At the end they rededucted the points from my account ( i ended up having the points deducted twice). They really need to reconsider that hotel being a 5 stars.

The bedrooms are clean and modern with plenty of space and a lovely bathroom. The rooms are also very quiet.    What let‚Äôs this hotel down is the service. Around the pool it felt like it was too much trouble to ask for even a menu. In the restaurant at breakfast it felt like the staff did not want to be there and everything was too much to ask. We asked five times at reception to have our air con fixed and after three nights gave up asking as we were leaving.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Francean G wrote a review Jan 2020,10,Restaurant was an awful experience,I went for dinner with my mum after spending a lovely 4 days in Marrakech in the Medina and we fancied some nice restaurant cuisine and the whole thing from start to finish was terrible. No drinks menus given when my mum ordered wine the waiter walked away and asked me 'Do you not like wine?!' I thought this was rude and insulting for all he knows I could be a recovering alcoholic (I'm not I'm just doing dry January) but more politely he could have asked would I like a glass or something less intrusive. Also the wine requested he said we dont have then brought the first choice out as per the original request. The bread plates weren't cleared away and the table was spilling over. I had some mint tea and another waitress came to pour some and it was empty and so was the glass and the just left it on the table without taking it away! The starters were wrong and when the right one did come the foie gras was awful. I ordered a medium rare veal and it arrived well done. My mum ordered shin of beef which was really fatty and looked like something from medieval times and adding to that they almost put the mains at the wrong table . At this point I said forget the main we just want the bill and I have never been looked at like this in a restaurant and asked 'Is there a problem?!' And the tone was rude. And yes there is a problem the whole thing was awful. We did only get charged for the starters and the drinks which still came to 900 dhs. All in all very uncomfortable and unenjoyable experience when I expect more from such a well known reputable chain. I have had better service in a McDonalds!

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,kathryn040 wrote a review Jan 2020,10,Very Disappointing,Very poor experience  We arrived at the Sofitel Spa hotel after a wonderful ten days in Morocco . 5 days in the Ryad Dyor in Marrakesh which was exceptional in every way and 4 days in Casablanca Four Seasons hotel  again a wonderfully comfortable hotel. So we were looking forward to our last night‚Äôs stay here . Not good from the start sadly  there was some confusion over the booking which we did resolve quite quickly and the young man dealing with it at reception offered us a free breakfast to make up for this  a nice gesture. He then went off duty and two rather rude female receptionists took over . They quickly retracted the offer of breakfast and asked us to prove we had been made this offer. She was more than rude and I can honestly say I have never been treated in this way before  checking into a hotel . It was embarrassing dismissive and poor service on every level . Having virtually accused us both of lying She then abruptly dismissed us  we went to our room to find someone else‚Äôs case in it and a welcome note that was not for us on the bed . We went back to reception  again the receptionist was dismissive  no hint if an apology either . They removed the case . The room we were given was old and tired looking and needed a revamp  the bed uncomfortable  stained carpets and grubby floors . There is a new section to the hotel and you need to ask to be here as the old part of the hotel is not good . We had a good meal in the restaurant but were served out of date flat beer  again no apology or replacement for this . We hoped to have a swim in the indoor pool but were informed there was a charge of ¬£25 per person for two hours  don‚Äôt think so !  So we will never stay there again and it definitely tarnished what had been to that point a wonderful stay in Morocco . I think some staff there need to understand what real customer service is and how to offer the high standard if care I am sure the hotel would want . So disappointed and upset by the whole experience .,Date of stay: January 2020,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Retford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathryn040

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Squid wrote a review Dec 2019,30,Rude,We stayed at the Hotel for four nights and would be hard pressed to find fault with the facility especially the pools grounds and location. Even the breakfast Buffet and dinners were above average. The reason for my low rating has to do with the attitude and indifference exhibited by the management toward it‚Äôs guests. For example we arrived very late and the hotel gave us what we believed were two of the worst rooms in the hotel one of which did not have a king bed (two twins pushed together) contrary to our reservations on the theory we were very late (true) and hotel was full. They also denied we had another reservation for a fourth nite but assured us all would be rectified the ‚ÄúNext Day.‚Äù The next day they did find the second reservation but said it was in a different wing of the building and they could not change either the rooms we were in or or consolidate the two reservations to stay the balance of our stay in the same rooms ‚Äúbut of course-would change the bed‚Äù. The manager told us to come back later in the evening and they would ‚Äúsee what could be done about putting us in the rooms consistent with our reservation‚Äù. Sure enough the evening came and nothing was done (not even changing the bed) and the manager said nothing could be done. This was totally unacceptable and after 30 minutes of arguing he relented and gave us the level of rooms consistent with our confirmation for two nites but advised us we still would have to move for the fourth nite; but to back each of the next two days. Nothing. On the fourth day they told us we had to move as incredible as that sounds and in spite of the fact that my wife was ill from a stomach illness. The manager called a Dr to visit my wife and said he would ‚Äúallow‚Äù us to stay in ‚Äúone room‚Äù so the Dr could examine her ‚Äúuntil 2 pm‚Äù. The Dr came about 11 am examined my wife found she had contracted a virus common from the food generally and prescribed medicine and to get at least a full day of rest. At 2 pm the manager called the room and said we had to leave. I replied my wife is sleeping and in bed his reply ‚ÄúOkay I‚Äôll Send a Wheel Chair to get Her‚Äù. At this point my wife dressed (we were already packed) and wanted to leave the hotel but my brother felt the damage had been done take matters up when we are home. I travel a lot still today maybe 75 room nights a year and when I owned a reasonably good sized company for 25 years traveled even more; and with all of the foul ups and problems traveling to every part of the world this was the most illogical and un-accommodating management I have ever encountered.,Date of stay: December 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Kinnelon, New Jersey",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Go2squid
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,FernandaCS72 wrote a review Dec 2019,20,"It could have been a very nice Christmas break, but...","As we booked our trip through Pin High because of the golf I wasn't able to add the points to my membership - which I understand. However being an Accor long term member I've never felt so unwelcomed in a hotel let alone 5 stars one. The first disappointment was during the check-in.    We were greeted by an unfriendly lady who asked for our passports and a credit card - no more word about anything or further information. We were offered tea a very talkative concierge came to offer tours and gave us a map. After waiting for over one hour we asked another receptionist (this time a friendly guy) what time we would be able to check-in and that we would like to have our documents back. The unfriendly lady was rude to the guy telling him that she had already told us that the check-in would be after 3 pm - WHICH SHE DIDN'T - as she didn't speak to us and we were waiting since noon. We asked for our luggage so we could change and go somewhere until we were able to check-in.    We came back around 4 pm with the hope that our room would be ready. Another surprise and another receptionist asking for our passports and credit card because he didn't have a clue that we already had done that and couldn't find anything under our names. In the meantime a third receptionist came with a machine and asked us to put our pin code to guarantee a deposit on our credit card. When were almost using our pin code to my surprise the credit card wasn't ours - it was from another guest. After waiting for this joke to be over we were given our key - but no luggage as it was stored in the hotel since noon.    We gave the luggage ticket to the receptionist who said he would take care of that and the luggage would be sent to our room. Another 40 minutes wait a call to the reception and the luggage was brought by someone who said the receptionist never told him to bring the luggage.    Unfortunately it was not the end of the joke as both suitcases were wet on the back including the cover with something that smells like alcohol. We called the reception and a lot of funny questions were asked. My husband went to the reception with his suitcase and showed to the ""chef of the concierges"" who questioned whether something wasn't broken in the suitcase because it wasn't possible that this could have happened there etc and that the suitcases were already like this when we left at the hotel.    My husband is a very patient person but he got very annoyed and brought the other suitcase to this gentleman who insisted it didn't happen there. Very bad service for a 5 stars hotel.    As nothing was damaged inside our luggage and the golf bags were fine we let this go for a moment. After less than 30 minutes the suitcases were dry which means that it definitely happened in the hotel and possible just before the suitcases were brought to our room. I spoke with this ""chef of concierge"" that it was almost dry and it indeed happened at the hotel. I had to hear from him that people start to use their minds and try to investigate things to find out what might have happened. At that stage I was looking for a hidden camera.    I have to admit that luckily we had the chance to meet nice people at the hotel: the lady who makes pancakes and three friendly waiters in the breakfast room.    We booked a tour to the Atlas and were given a price in EURO and were told that we should pay by cash - which is a bit weird - by a guy that was at the concierge's desk but wasn't the concierge or the ""chef of the concierges"". I asked for the price in Dirham and said I was going to book later. When we went to book the tour we gave the cash to the concierge and were expecting the change. When I asked for the change we got offended and threw the money on the desk and asked me to get it. It doesn't matter if the change is one or one hundred what is right is right.    I could carry on but I will conclude at the check-out. We got the bill and noticed that they charged us twice for the Christmas dinner: one on the 22.12 and the other one on the 24.12. We explained that it wasn't correct and after a lot of talk between the receptionist the lady who booked the dinner and another guy the concluded that we were indeed correct.    Our trip to Marrakech could have been spectacular however due to the lack of hospitality and proper training of the staff it wasn't. I can't recommend this destination neither this hotel.    The close this long story during my stay I contacted Accor Customer Service one day after we checked-in to complain about the check-in/ luggage experience and never heard from them. As an ALL member it just got more disappointing.    At the Sofitel Marrakech Lounge and Spa the customer is always wrong!

We booked a few activities with the hotel and again Adil (great personality and very helpful) and his team are always there to make sure your every needs are catered for. I would definitely recommend a trip to the Atlas Mountains via the concierge team. The hotel offers great facilities for families (outdoor heated pool); mini balls; table tennis and chess; there‚Äôs a charge to use the indoor swimming pool and kids under 16 cannot use the indoor swimming pool (which I completely disagree with) as I traveled with a young family and was quite happy to pay for the facilities indoor; decor of the hotel was nice; location is fantastic; hotel staff are one of the best I have encountered especially Saad; who would personally call you by your first name (a nice touch); just wished other hotels would be so forthcoming; rooms are cleaned twice a day; free complimentary water; beds are the most comfortable I have slept in.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,janX9195UE wrote a review Dec 2019,40,"A nice stay, but ...",We arrived on a Friday night in the hotel. Very friendly greeting by the doorman. Then our first surprise. We did the Accor express check in from our computer at home and we got the reply that our room-key was waiting for us with the concierge. No way we had to queue for 15 minutes and had to go through the whole check-in procedure (showing passports signing forms etc.). Why proposing an express check-in when it is not considered at all!  We got to our Junior-Suite which was nice and also the views were as expected. The bellman arrived promptly with our luggage.  The next morning we asked the concierge if he had a sightseeing program for the Medina. He proposed a guided tour (4-5 hours) with a hotel guide for ‚Ç¨150 for 2 persons. After having confirmed with him that the guide would not escort us in ‚Äötourist traps‚Äò in the Souk we booked the tour for Sunday at noon which the concierge after a phone call confirmed. When we arrived at the concierge desk Sunday morning another concierge was not aware of our reservation. He started to make some phone calls and after 5 minutes he confirmed that the driver would come and the guide was waiting for us elsewhere. I assumed that the fee would be charged to our room (as it was supposed to be a hotel guide) but the concierge insisted on a cash payment which struck us as rather strange.  The friendly driver took us to Jardin Majorelle where the female guide was waiting for us. Next surprise we had to purchase entrance tickets which we assumed were included in the ‚Ç¨150 fee. No big deal but you get the feeling of being exploited.  At the Palais Bahia the same scenario. Until here we more or less liked the tour.  When in the Souk she did exactly what we did not want she took us into shops of her friends that wanted to sell us stuff. She did not appreciate at all that we did not like this kind of ‚Äösightseeing‚Äòand started to become less friendly. After 2 more attempts to make us do some shopping she quickly guided us through the Souk to arrive on the Place Jemaa el Fna which we crossed rapidly to meet our driver again on the main road who took us back to the hotel. The whole tour lasted less than 3 hours.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,ChristineBindert wrote a review Nov 2019,30,Hit or miss,"The hotel is well located and used to be fantastic. It is now jaded and definitively needs a major uplift. The staff is trying hard but is ""hit or miss"". The staff is obviously not trained well enough: many people running around but no coordination. This was true at breakfast (boiled egg never arrived) as well as with the concierge service. Restaurant reservation "" forgotten"" no info as to the fact that the restaurant we were going to has two different locations. One concierge had no idea what the other had already done. The restaurant was also disorganised and the food was not good and extremely pricey at lunch. The exception was Fati at breakfast who was helpful.

It was made perfect by the Sofitel Marrakech. The rooms were spacious and bright with natural light. The balcony was perfect (2 floor) as it spilled out via a few steps to the large outdoor seating are where breakfast was served. Seating under awnings and umbrellas and sipping of fresh strong coffee was the perfect way to start our days.  The huge pool and spa area were available but our attentions were on visiting the old city and spice market.  A morning spent learning to cook in a tagine then enjoying our labors of the morning over lunch.

The waiters were on the ball for breakfast. Tea please - Yes Sir. Salt and pepper - Yes Sir. Everything was yes and done. Last year it was yes and sometimes not done. So well done on all waiters for working so well together.    A big thanks to Omar by the pool. He was so friendly and provided us with excellent service.    The pool as good as usual and the sun beds. Maybe some broken one need to be replaced.    We cannot wait to see the new refurbished breakfast restaurant.    The orangerie food and tapas for dinner was also excellent.    We will come back next year definitely.    Maybe something to work towards is the kids club. Use kids club of four season as an example or kids club of hotel barri√®re le nouara.    As the kids club is not very inviting.    Also the kids club should be open all day and offer food for lunch for the kids. As when we got up and went to the pool at 12:00 the kids club was nearly closing. Then when it opened at 14:30 we usually went for lunch. Closing at 17:30 is also too early.

Huge room with large terrace massive bathroom and a very spacious seating area. TV in both bed area and seating area.    Staying with our son we found a few areas of the hotel not very pushchair friendly and found ourselves carrying it up and down stairs a few times a day. That‚Äôs aside the staff were very accommodating and promptly organised a bottle warmer / baby bath upon request.    Pool areas were great but they were not heated at this time of the year - not even the kids pool - which meant it was a bit too cold for our son. Wish they had made it clear in their webpage exactly when the pools are / aren‚Äôt heated.    Breakfast was good and the head chef organised anything we requested - such as fresh french toast on thin bread rather than the thick slices in the buffet. Waitresses were amazing with our son he loved them!    Concierge very helpful in directing us around the city and organised a private trip to the Atlas Mountains for us complete with baby seat in the car!    Our return flight was late in the day and staff promised us a room to get fresh in and mainly to let our son nap but when we went to collect keys for this room we were told it had been given to someone else so instead we had to make use of some toilets while staff stood outside to give us privacy - not the best end to our stay and was a huge inconvenience - would have been 5* had it not been for this,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ash0123456

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Nicole wrote a review Oct 2019,40,4* hotel,Room  Inside the hotel room is very plush and certainly deserves 5*. It is very relaxing. The rooms are decently sized and very clean. Sofitel beds are amazing. The bathroom is very clean but I feel like the tap water smells!    Pool areas  The pool area is a 3/4* the loungers needs to be replaced. They have cigarette burns in them. The pool food is ok but it is hard to eat with birds flying everywhere. A bird even pooed on the table and it was not wiped straight away. Also there was a lot of flys.    Not many staff speak English so It is hard to communicate.    Security  On one occasion I was stopped by security and asked if I was staying at the hotel. Even though I had seen that same guard three times that day in the same clothing. I was actually a little thrown back when he approached me.    Food  I ordered room service one night and it was vile. I ordered pizza and a chocolate brownie the pizza was like eating cardboard and the brownie was rock hard and cold. Upon check out saaud a receptionist was very helpful and removed the pizza from our bill.    The breakfast is good. They make the crepes then warm them up. I do not understand why they don‚Äôt just make them fresh as there is never a queue for them. The fresh juice was very nice and I recommend the cucumber and mint. One day we tried the buffet for lunch and it is extremely expensive for what it actually is. We paid 900 Dirhams for 4 non alcoholic drinks and 2 Buffet meals. The pool lounge food was very filling and much cheaper than the buffet.    Staff  Most of the staff are very helpful. I felt that the check in was very unorganised there were several receptionist fighting over two computers. When I was checked in a deposit was taken and I was told to sign forms. I was not told what time I should return to collect my door key. The service at restaurant is extremely slow! The manager in the Buffett is extremely helpful and welcoming.    One day we was getting ready to leave the hotel and house keeping walked in  without knocking and my husband was naked! I would have forgiven her but music was playing in the room so as soon as she cracked the door she should of heard it and left but she never!    We had a driver whilst we were staying in the Sofitel and he made it clear to us that the best service is in either Sofitel or four seasons.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,rko21 wrote a review Sep 2019,40,Great renovation of Lounge and Spa. Some things to improve,I have regularly visited Sofitel Marrakech Lounge and Spa over the past few years and I am pleased to say that the renovations done to the Lounge and Spa part have made it more elegant. The rooms are modern contemporary clean (I did the dust test with my finger and found nothing) and well appointed. The only negative with the rooms is that they no longer have bath tubs which is a shame for a 5 star luxury hotel such as the Sofitel.    The service is good and attentive. The porter/doorman Said is an amazingly kind and great person. Fatima at breakfast who cooks the Moroccan mssemen bghrir harcha etc is always smiling loves her job and is so kind and a lovely woman. She seems to be the mother of the hotel. Said (porter/doorman) and Fatima (breakfast chef) are the stars of the hotel.    The pool service is slow it can be difficult to get a towel if your bed/sun-lounger doesn‚Äôt have one. The pool team could be improved.    Please note renovations are going on at the Palais Imperial section of the hotel and there is some noise distribution currently.    I found Mehdi on the Palais Imperial section is very rude and brash no conversation or smiles. I remember him from previous visits and he still has not improved.    It is a shame we were not offered a welcome mint tea or drink hot/cold towels and snack at check in like I have experienced here previously.    Overall a very good stay in September 2019 for 3 nights. Some things to improve on as I mentioned but overall very good.    J‚Äôai visit√© le Sofitel Marrakech Lounge and Spa beaucoup de fois dans le pass√©. Je suis content que les r√©novations sont bien fait et la partie du Lounge and Spa est plus √©l√©gante moderne et chic maintenant.

Les chambres sont comfortables et bien √©quip√©es mais c‚Äôest dommage qu‚Äôil n‚Äôy a pas de baignoire - c‚Äôest dommage pour un h√¥tel luxueux 5 √©toiles comme le Sofitel.    Le porteur Said est tr√®s gentil et aimable. La femme Fatima qui cuisine mssemen bghrir harcha etc pendant le petit d√©jeuner est aussi hyper gentille et une femme tr√®s aimable et souriante. C‚Äôest √©vident qu‚Äôelle aime beaucoup son travail et elle est magnifique avec tous les gens sans exception. Elle est la m√®re de l‚Äôh√¥tel.    J‚Äôai trouv√© que le service √† la piscine est lente et c‚Äôest difficile de trouver une serviette.    Mehdi qui travaille √† la reception du Palais Imperial est vraiment nul.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,siobhansmith wrote a review Sep 2019,40,Lovely hotel,Spent 4 nights at this hotel at the end of September. A last minute short break with my husband. Hotel is situated in a great part of the city. Just far enough away from the overwhelming noise and hussle of the city but close enough to walk to the modern part or a short taxi ride from the main square costing around ¬£5. There are restaurants and cafes within easy walking distance of the hotel if you don‚Äôt want to pay the prices of the hotel. The hotel is lovely with a gorgeous pool area. We stayed in the spa side of the hotel which was lucky as we heard many people complaining about the other side as they had some decorating works going on with lots of noise and banging.  The rooms are spotless with plenty of space good aircon. The shower looked promising with a large over head rainfall type head but the water pressure wasn‚Äôt great.  Pool area is stunning. Lots of really comfortable day beds and a beautiful huge pool with another slightly smaller pool and a kids splash area. The pool side service is the slowest I‚Äôve ever encountered. I‚Äôd say the pool area was only half full with plenty of staff available but on 2 occasions we waited over an hour for a bowl of french fries !! It‚Äôs easier to sit at the pool side restaurant and get table service the food is very good.  The pool Attendants are so helpful and welcoming. Always on hand to move your umbrella to shade you and while your swimming they come around straightening up your towel on the bed and making sure you haven‚Äôt left anything in the direct sunlight. The pool area was lovely and peaceful until people started turning up with their own music speakers no consideration for people around them. Management need to get on top of this and stop it. I also don‚Äôt approve of people being in the pool with drinks In glass bottles.  Breakfast is buffet style. It‚Äôs mainly egg bread and fruit. Hotel is beautiful in the evening all lit up with lanterns and candles. Great live band too.,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/siobhansmithis
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Paprika25 wrote a review Sep 2019,40,"good location, comfortable, bad check in","Room for improvement:  1) pick up service 9/23: I was told over repeated emails that the driver will meet me at the airport arrival hall. I exited the baggage claim through security guard's door and found a bunch of men holding signs of their various hotels/riads. None for Sofitel. I waited for 10 minutes went to the information desk and gave the girl $2 to use her phone to call Sofitel. After a long time ringing and ringing and ringing a girl finally answered. When I asked her for my promised/verified/confirmed pick up at 10:40pm (I'd arrived early and waited until past 10:40pm) she said that the driver is there. I told her I'm staring at all the men who are staring right back at this solo female traveler. And none of their signs says Sofitel or my name. She kept insisting he's there. Then I ask ""inside the airport at the arrivals' area as promised or outside the building?"" She first said inside. Then changed it to outside. Decided to walk outside in the middle of the night to check and found him standing with a lot more men holding their signs. Would be better if he was standing with the fewer men INSIDE the building where the arrival's hall is like the other better pick up services did for their clients. Going outside alone at night isn't the safety I was promised when I'd reconfirmed the pick up.    2) check in staff would benefit from a class in customer service. When I arrived around 11:30PM on 9/23/19 the nice middle-aged bellman took me to the front desk. He was smiling and enthusiastic about his job. The front desk had a young man named ""Ben---"" something. No eye contact no smile. Bellman had to ask the guy more than once to check me in. Bellman asked for my passport and tried to give it to this Ben--- fellow. He tried to not take the passport. Then finally did. As if by checking guests in he is doing someone a favor. Then out came a young woman who started working on a separate computer. No eye contact no smile. No words from either of them. Ben--- typed on his computer she typed on hers. Then the bellman brought me a cold towel and asked me to sit on the couch farther away from reception. However then the front desk woman asked me for a credit card out of the blue. I thought this Ben dude was checking me in. So I asked if I should move myself over to her station. She and Ben loudly informed me ""it's the same madame! I'm just trying to help him to make it faster!"" Okay... maybe if either of them had looked me in the eye smiled or even said hello perhaps they wouldn't have had to scream at me in frustration. Oh well.    Woke up at 5am with a dog barking nonstop outside. Can't really be helped :)    Goods:  1) great facade and lobby is beautiful.  2) good bellmen/security guards. Good eye contact smile and hellos.  3) The next morning I spoke to other front desk staff: Chaimae Ali Ahmed (concierge). All laughing and smiling and willing to answer questions. Chaimae MAY have been the one who checked me in the night before but in the morning there was a big smile on her face and willingness to do her job. Perhaps she was sleepy tired or frustrated with having to help Ben--- the night before. However the Chaimae I met in the morning was good. Ali was actually amazing at his job. He manned the second reception and did everything with enthusiasm. He called the concierge for me when the concierge wasn't at the desk yet.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Sylvia J wrote a review Sep 2019,40,Great location with a bad experience!,This hotel is beautiful and very close to the M√©dina Koutoubia Mosque and the Jemaa el-Fina (square and market place). The views from our rooms to the pool area was just magnificent with excellent service from pool staff.  Hotel hallways and room seemed dark with very dimmed lighting.  Breakfast Buffet is the best part of this hotel - one of the best varieties of Moroccan and European dishes. Only flaw here are the Eggs weren‚Äôt great as they were pre cooked and cold.    Bad experience was I lost my bottle of perfume in my toilet bag which was in the bathroom on the first day of my stay in this hotel. I complained to the front desk and the Housekeeper who came in the evening to set the beds but no response or follow up from the staff.  They also need to improve the service of getting bags to rooms promptly after checkin. Ours took 30 mins to get to us.    All in all I would recommend this hotel due to location beautiful building  gardens spacious room and fantastic pool staff.,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Mount Gravatt, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SylviaJ661

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Frank W wrote a review Sep 2019,20,Significant lack of service,During an exhibition I stayed for 6 nights at this property. The hotel and its facilities Are ok and I would rate that with 4 stars. But when it comes to the service level I must admit that was the poorest experience for a very long time. With the exception of the housekeeping lady (which was excellent) and one person (in charge of making the fresh juices at breakfast) the whole team significantly underperformed. As an example - while we were having dinner and eating our main course a server came and asked us to fill out a form on our preference in room categories. Ordering tea without sugar basically a mission impossible. Overall the service level was unacceptable.,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Magden, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/franky1708

We had a spacious and well appointed suite overlooking the pool.    The staff were amazingly friendly and on the first morning we were already being addressed by name. A special mention here for the concierge Adil who arranged a tour of the City with an English speaking guide and driver and also arranged our transport to and from our other  destination in Morocco the Sofitel Thalassa Sea and Spa Agadir.    The bar and restaurant were both excellent with many staff ready to provide a very good service.    We enjoyed our stay very much and hope to have the opportunity to return.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Tasneem A wrote a review Aug 2019,10,Avoid like the plague!!! Zero stars if I could!,"The hotel was beautiful and some staff like Soukaina and Ihram were genuine. However we had a terrible experience with the rest of the staff and it ruined our trip completely.  On the first 2 days we waited 15minutes just for a sun bed whilst other French-speaking guests were offered and shown sun beds instantly (they arrived after us). Then another guest took pity upon us and offered his sun bed to us as he saw we had a baby with us and were completely ignored by all staff at the pool. We then entered the pool and were inside for 1hour 30mins simply because staff at the pool could not be bothered to supply us with towels despite asking on 4 occasions (twice to the same member of staff who told us he is ""tired""). This is the kind of service from a supposedly 5* international chain - ridiculous! This happened on 2 days so we felt victimised as we don't speak either of the native languages. We then complained to a manager called Yaseen who offered us complimentary access to the VIP pool for the rest of our stay along with free lunch for the day. This was lovely of him. However even though Yaseen has explained to staff at the VIP pool that we had access we were then questioned and denied access every day for the duration of our stay. Each time we had to then ask the pool staff to call the manager and confirm that we were allowed to use the VIP (extreme) pool. This was extremely embarassing and made us feel as if we were not worthy of using the facilities.  Upon check out it took 30minutes just for concierge to send a bellboy up to our room to collect our luggage. Then as we were settling our bill the hotel had charged us for usage of the VIP pool and for the free lunch for the day that we were offered. We then spoke to manager Yaseen again who told us ""there's nothing he can do."" On further debating and arguing he then decided to waive the cost of the access and lunch that had been offered to us for free. He then went to consult a colleague and was gone for more than 15minutes and left us sitting at the reception. We went to find him to see that he was having lengthy conversations with guests and waiters at the breakfast lounge whilst we were left waiting and needed to catch a flight. Due to this inconcvenience we then arrived at the airport to find that the bag drop counter had been closed we were sent to various counters only to find them closed and responses we got from staff were ""it's not my responsibility."" Therefore we missed our flight. I have never seen such lazy and incompetent staff in the world as I have seen in Morocco both at Sofitel and at the airport. They have cost us an arm and leg due to their sheer arrogance and incompetence.  I cannot believe how a 5* chain such as Sofitel is allowing this to happen as usually they are great in other countries and I frequently stay at Sofitel in different countries. It had ruined my holiday completely and this was to celebrate my anniversary. Thanks Sofitel for an awful time you will definitely be hearing from us further as this kind of disgusting behaviour and service is not acceptable.",Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TasA91

Pool is lovely DJ adds atmosphere but we found it odd that at 6.30pm we could only get room service no food was available outside. The service was also painfully slow we waited 45 minutes for a drink to be delivered. The hotel is perfectly placed for the Medina the setting is beautiful and the hotel shops are well priced with lovely products.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Kvgraham wrote a review Aug 2019,10,A massive miss and we got food poisoning!,We are a family of 4 (sons 16 and 14) who have traveled all over Africa and the Middle East. We had a wonderful week in Morocco beginning with 2 nights in La Mamounia (highly recommend: excellent service: very discreet and professional) and closing out (after doing a desert camp and overnights in Dades and Fes) at the Sofitel. We were really looking forward to this as our last night but what a disaster. Service was as some others have noted: disinterested and/or unresponsive. We were tired after coming from Casablanca and decided to eat in at the Terrace restaurant. Big mistake: First question was not how we were or would we like a drink but would we like a Sofitel credit card?! No. Second issue was the giant TV screens showing circuit loops of the nightclub (tacky) but worst of all by 1am my husband and I had dreadful cramps and all the usual food poisoning signs. Called the front desk at 7am to tell them and to ask if they had any pharmacy suggestions. The woman could not have been less interested and made no comment apart from saying she could call a doctor. I said we had a long day of flying ahead and needed to leave within the hour. She said there was nothing she could suggest: there was no apology no concern no questions. Hugely ironic that we‚Äôd eaten at random places all week with no issues and we got laid out on the last night in a supposedly 5 star hotel! I rarely write negative reviews but this was just not good and we had a very rough travel day. Would not recommend.,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kvgraham

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Mikaeel wrote a review Aug 2019,40,Beautiful Location. Beautiful Amenities. Poor Staff.,The hotel is located in the Hivernage area. Well located to Medina - The Old City and 15 Minutes from the airport. Its within walking distance to several hotels including a casino and several shisha bars and restaurants.    The hotel pool was absolutely beautiful. Unmatched to the So Lounge - where there is a shisha area and bar populated by all the wealthy of Africa.    The hotel restaurants had beautiful vibes but poor food and even worse service.    The hotel reception wouldn't pick up their phone and the few times that they choose to pick up their phone - they had an attitude. Housekeeping refused to clean and seemed like they wanted to clean on their own time - leaving mess with much of the room often staying dirty.    The pool staff would take 1 hour to give a simple water bottle it seemed that the hotel staff didn't want to pay you attention unless you were a man willing to buy a bottle or a woman that they were offering to you for the night.

They offered an upgrade to the premier suite but upon arrival we realized that the view was not as nice as the view promised in our original reservation (there was a tree blocking most of the view which was mostly a barren dirt landscape). They kindly moved us to the junior suite we reserved and it had a nice view to the area around the pool. The bed was very comfortable the amenities nice and the balcony was nice. A few things led to me giving 4/5: the pool staff members were not very hospitable bordering on unfriendly at times there were a few interactions that made us feel unwelcome and in our room one of the cabinet doors was unhinged when we opened it (a bit sloppy for a 5 star hotel). However many staff members were very hospitable especially at the spa and the restaurants and we would return.,Date of stay: July 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mdv_1980_

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Chris J wrote a review Jul 2019,50,"Great hotel, great pool area, great location",We had a great 4 days at this hotel. The room was large with a nice view looking across the gardens. Bathroom was good with a bath and separate shower (not all rooms have that so check if you want one). The pool area was large with enough quality sun loungers to go round (although the hotel didn't seem full). Nice boule court too. Breakfast was good with a large selection of food at the buffet plus some other food stations for eggs etc. Spa was good too. Location was fine just outside the city walls and an easy 10 minute walk to the main centre and tourist sites with minimal hassle from anyone.    Only real downside was the smoking round the pool which most people seemed to do even with young children nearby. Ideally there would be a smoking area (or preferably no smoking at all round the pool).    The only other point worthy of comment is that the Sofitel for some strange reason seems to operate two hotels with two different Sofitel names out of the one large building. They have separate check-ins but share everything else. None of the staff could explain why there were two Sofitel brands there and it just seemed that there were different rooms types.

I have to thank a thousand times the lovely lady that cleaned our room each day and made it spotless - she really went over and above the welcome and helpfulness of Saad and Ahmed at the reception desk the friendliness of the people making sure we had a wonderful experience at breakfast (we did what a selection of food!). A big hotel with lots of room to wander close to the Medina if you can tear yourself away from the pools. We decided at the last minute to extend our stay that's how good it was. Thank you everyone for making a work trip much more than just that. My recommendation - go here if you are a family if you like great food if you want impeccable service if you like a bit of luxury and you are picky about cleanliness.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled on business,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LDupontB

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Chris J wrote a review Jul 2019,50,"Great hotel, great pool area, great location",We had a great 4 days at this hotel. The room was large with a nice view looking across the gardens. Bathroom was good with a bath and separate shower (not all rooms have that so check if you want one). The pool area was large with enough quality sun loungers to go round (although the hotel didn't seem full). Nice boule court too. Breakfast was good with a large selection of food at the buffet plus some other food stations for eggs etc. Spa was good too. Location was fine just outside the city walls and an easy 10 minute walk to the main centre and tourist sites with minimal hassle from anyone.    Only real downside was the smoking round the pool which most people seemed to do even with young children nearby. Ideally there would be a smoking area (or preferably no smoking at all round the pool).    The only other point worthy of comment is that the Sofitel for some strange reason seems to operate two hotels with two different Sofitel names out of the one large building. They have separate check-ins but share everything else. None of the staff could explain why there were two Sofitel brands there and it just seemed that there were different rooms types. Unnecessarily confusing.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/801ChrisJ

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,AliAlab wrote a review Jul 2019,50,Girls relaxing birthday break away,2nd time of visiting this hotel and once again did not disappoint. Stayed in the lounge and spa side which is definitely my preferred choice. Rooms bright airy well maintained and clean.  Celebrated my birthday while away and girl friends who I was with also had birthdays 2 days before and the day after leaving. The birthday cakes that were presented to us were amazing including the breakfast singing of happy birthday from the catering staff.  Omar who worked at the pool bar was amazing he kept us well feed and watered and nothing was too much trouble. True asset to the hotel.  The head chef also went above and beyond by make french toast especially for us.    Highly recommend but do expect it to be expensive to drink and eat at the hotel( even compared to London prices).,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliAlab

Hostess spent the entire time there taking Kim Kardashian style selfies of all the waiters there only one seemed to be actually working out of around 15. A vodka martini isn‚Äôt that hard... it was for the barman. Dry with a twist came back as a vodka martini mix with an olive. Tried the bar at the back. Just as bad.

Upon arrival to the hotel we provided our voucher showing proof of payment. However the morning of check out Sofitel informed me they had not received the full payment from Alpha Rooms and were holding myself and wife accountable and demanded that we paid the full weeks accommodation directly to them. This was as we were leaving to get our flight home.    I completely understand they want to be paid for the service they provided but this is an issue with Alpha Rooms and the hotel themselves. We arrived on the 15th May departing on the 22nd and Sofitel decided to deal with the issue of non payment as we were leaving for our flight home. They had 7 days previous to resolve this. We refused to pay as we had already paid in full and found it completely unfair to demand us to pay again before letting us leave for our flight home.    After a discussion with Sofitel front desk they agreed to let us leave to catch our flight and agreed it was an issue between with Sofitel and Alpha Rooms and they would follow up with them.    The day after 23rd May I checked my account to see Sofitel have taken the full amount out of my bank account! I have already paid Alpha Rooms 2 weeks prior to arrival and now because of the incompetence of the booking agent and booking department of Sofitel I have now had to pay this hotel twice and I am ¬£1600 out of pocket.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Discover44693 wrote a review May 2019,40,Sofitel dining problems,I am currently staying at the Sofitel lounge and Spa in Marrakech. It is supposed to be a five star hotel. The hotel is very good. Room is fine and well looked after. Breakfast and lunch are excellent. Beautiful pool areas quiet and peaceful. In fact truly a five star hotel.... until 7pm when it becomes like a cattle market! Because of Ramadan the hotel is offering a buffet after sundown which is very well attended by outside guests. This is great for the hotel but for residents it is a disaster as it is very difficult to get a table even if you book in advance!! Last night we did not eat until 10pm tonight we are going to eat outside the hotel even though we are full board.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Discover44693

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Simon M wrote a review May 2019,10,Dishonest Hotel,Do not book with this hotel. Ruined our recent visit to Marrakech.    Booked this hotel through Alpha Rooms. Upon arrival to the hotel we provided our voucher showing proof of payment. However the morning of check out Sofitel informed me they had not received the full payment from Alpha Rooms and were holding myself and wife accountable and demanded that we paid the full weeks accommodation directly to them. This was as we were leaving to get our flight home.    I completely understand they want to be paid for the service they provided but this is an issue with Alpha Rooms and the hotel themselves. We arrived on the 15th May departing on the 22nd and Sofitel decided to deal with the issue of non payment as we were leaving for our flight home. They had 7 days previous to resolve this. We refused to pay as we had already paid in full and found it completely unfair to demand us to pay again before letting us leave for our flight home.    After a discussion with Sofitel front desk they agreed to let us leave to catch our flight and agreed it was an issue between with Sofitel and Alpha Rooms and they would follow up with them.    The day after 23rd May I checked my account to see Sofitel have taken the full amount out of my bank account! I have already paid Alpha Rooms 2 weeks prior to arrival and now because of the incompetence of the booking agent and booking department of Sofitel I have now had to pay this hotel twice and I am ¬£1600 out of pocket.    Who knows how this will ever be resolved with the agent and hotel both blaming one another!,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Stepps, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simonmM8062HF

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Simon M wrote a review May 2019,10,Dishonest Hotel,Do not book with this hotel. Ruined our recent visit to Marrakech.    Booked this hotel through Alpha Rooms. Upon arrival to the hotel we provided our voucher showing proof of payment. However the morning of check out Sofitel informed me they had not received the full payment from Alpha Rooms and were holding myself and wife accountable and demanded that we paid the full weeks accommodation directly to them. This was as we were leaving to get our flight home.    I completely understand they want to be paid for the service they provided but this is an issue with Alpha Rooms and the hotel themselves. We arrived on the 15th May departing on the 22nd and Sofitel decided to deal with the issue of non payment as we were leaving for our flight home. They had 7 days previous to resolve this. We refused to pay as we had already paid in full and found it completely unfair to demand us to pay again before letting us leave for our flight home.    After a discussion with Sofitel front desk they agreed to let us leave to catch our flight and agreed it was an issue between with Sofitel and Alpha Rooms and they would follow up with them.    The day after 23rd May I checked my account to see Sofitel have taken the full amount out of my bank account! I have already paid Alpha Rooms 2 weeks prior to arrival and now because of the incompetence of the booking agent and booking department of Sofitel I have now had to pay this hotel twice and I am ¬£1600 out of pocket.    Who knows how this will ever be resolved with the agent and hotel both blaming one another!,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Stepps, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simonmM8062HF

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Discover44693 wrote a review May 2019,40,Sofitel dining problems,I am currently staying at the Sofitel lounge and Spa in Marrakech. It is supposed to be a five star hotel. The hotel is very good. Room is fine and well looked after. Breakfast and lunch are excellent. Beautiful pool areas quiet and peaceful. In fact truly a five star hotel.... until 7pm when it becomes like a cattle market! Because of Ramadan the hotel is offering a buffet after sundown which is very well attended by outside guests. This is great for the hotel but for residents it is a disaster as it is very difficult to get a table even if you book in advance!! Last night we did not eat until 10pm tonight we are going to eat outside the hotel even though we are full board.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Discover44693

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Alexandra D wrote a review Jan 2019,10,Stolen necklace,The holiday in the hotel was going really well until one night during our stay at Sofitel my boyfriend and I decided to spend the night at a friend's. Since we were late and in a rush to leave the hotel for dinner I forgot to leave a very important necklace in the safe where all the other valuables were kept but left it inside a bag instead. The next day we came back and the necklace was not in the place where I left it anymore. Call me stupid for not remembering to put it in the safe but it is unacceptable that these things happen in a 5 star hotel. A hotel is given 5 stars if it makes you feel at home... these things in my home do not happen. Obviously even after the denunciation the cleaning lady was kept working there so you might want to watch out if you're planning a trip there.,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexandradY4249FX

The staff spoke good english and everything seemed to work. Rooms are great - get the newly refurbished rooms and the pool area is beautiful. We are lucky with the service across the board. I could have given 5 stars if it wasn't for the security staff at the entrance. They seemed to have a deal with the rip off crass taxi drivers every time we asked the taxies they seemed to get the most expensive annoying & rude drivers and they will walk away when asked for help it was pretty awful.

Upon arrival it was not clear where the check-in was especially as the Sofitel Imperial Palace Hotel and the Sofitel Lounge and Spa are effectively the same hotel site but have different check-in with no signs to indicate this.  We pretty much got lost every time we went to our room!  There was no signs for the restaurants and there were all in fairly unusual places so signs would have been extremely helpful.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,David B wrote a review Dec 2018,30,Ok. Not as good as other Sofitels,I've stayed at a number of Sofitel and Pullman hotels. This is probably the worst for the lot. I'd say more 3 star than 5 star. The Superior room is...uninspiring. I'd at least expect a bath in a 5 star hotel.  While the staff are friendly they are disorganised. 2 hours to get room keys having to call at 4pm to get room services is just not good enough.  400 Dihrams to use the infinity pool (non residents can use too) isn't acceptable either for an expensive hotel.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,AlsterHamburg wrote a review Dec 2018,20,"Poor service, bad organized, simple rooms",Location:    This Sofitel Hotel is located in an exclusive part of Marrakech.    We have booked a double bed room of the category Deluxe Koutoub.    Check In:    Upon arrival late evening we have not received a warm welcome.  No water drink or sweets were offered.  But I was forced to give them my credit card although the room rate was prepaid.  After a longer discussion I got informed that they wanted to charge me in advance in case that I would take something out of the Mini Bar.  I have rejected this wish. Then I needed to pay the City tax in advance!    After this Check In we got guided to our room.    Room:    The room (176) was at the end of the building.    The room was dark like in a hole although the light was switched on!    And more important: The so named Deluxe room was as simple as in a 2 Star Hotel.    It has a small balcony facing a part of the garden and the street.    Bar at 1. Floor:    Then we visited the Bar located in the first floor.    The music was playing very loud like in a Discotheque.    It was almost impossible to hold a conversation.    Most of the staff was caring about themselves.    They were playing with their cell phones or holding a small talk.    Even when they stand in a group 3 meter away from us they have not cared or paid attention at us.    We ordered a bottle of Medaillon rouge red wine charged with 440 Dirham (about 45 ‚Ç¨).    In other exclusive restaurants in the city of Marrakech we got charged with 260-340 Dirham for the same wine.    On another day in the Bar of this hotel we had the same problems with the staff!    The day before our departure we have asked for the bill.    We got presented the booklet opened it and it was empty!!! There was no bill inside!    Breakfast:    Upon arrival we got asked for our room number.    Then a young waitress wanted to guide us to our table.    But she did not know where a free table was available.    After walking together more than 5 minutes I have asked her if she does know where a free table is.    She said yes and disappeared and let us stand alone.    So we went back to the entrance made a complaint and a supervisor brought us to a table which was not cleaned.    It took almost 10 minutes until it was done.    Even the table was not cleaned in a proper way.    Still bread crumbs were left. Then I got a cup for the coffee (out of a cupboard) which was still dirty.    Now we saw that 90% of the plates were empty and not refilled.    In general the choice of cold cuts was poor.    When trying to get strawberries out of a pot at the same time (!) a cook also tried to catch the rest of it to prepare a juice. He was unwilling to wait till the guest has picked his fruits!    The ambiance of this breakfast restaurant room is very simple.    Cheapest sofas and chairs are available in this 5 Star Hotel.    In general we found chaos in organizing this breakfast.    There is enough staff but most of them are unorganized and not well trained and not well organized.    Most have a very limited knowledge of English.    Finally I cannot recommend this hotel.    My subjective rating:    Check In: 1 point    Room: 2 points    Value for money: 2 points    Look of public areas: 4 points    Service: 1 point,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Cannes, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlsterHamburg

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Tracy C wrote a review Dec 2018,40,We booked a birthday dinner reservation.,1stly: We booked a dinner reservation at the So Lounge. However when we arrived to the hotel security paid no attention there was no signs or direction from anyone. So we walked in and hosted ourself where we felt the bar/restaurant would be. So we went outside to find the restaurant.    2nd: We sat down at the Omega restaurant however the woman was very fast to seat us down and it didn't look familiar to the pictures I had viewed of the reservation I had book previously as I booked a dinner and show which takes place in the So Lounge.  So we asked after ordering starters if we were in the right place to find out we wasn't and the lady who sat us didn't even check our reservation.    3rd: I had oraganised a mini surpise for my boyfriend at the hotel. Video play and a birthday cake which was displayed on the big screen on the lounge. Certainly a five star experience.    Key Tip: Can be expesensive if you spend the whole night there. Drinks aren't very heap.    Bad: External staff work within the hotel. The photographer who arrived during the birthday celebration charged us 660 dirham for 12 photos. However told me 60 dirham to print all 12. So I agreed that was fine until he came back and said no he said 660 dirham which is crazy.    He then said I could pay 400 dirham for 6 pictures.. (which is 32pound) for 6 pictures.  We were aware of how much images cost to develop and everything as the machine he printed it on is literally at the back of the lounge.    His answer was its 'sofitel' however he wasn't even a staff of Sofitel.    Was a total rip off. Hotel staff said they have no control over external staff. Its very bad for business when you are being charged 50pounds for 12 photos.    Great experince however disappoint during the celebration.    Great show GREAT singers.    We have visited MANY sofitel around the world. So will be back again!!    Please take pride in external staff the way you do for your own staff.

So we went outside to find the restaurant.    2nd: We sat down at the Omega restaurant however the woman was very fast to seat us down and it didn't look familiar to the pictures I had viewed of the reservation I had book previously as I booked a dinner and show which takes place in the So Lounge.  So we asked after ordering starters if we were in the right place to find out we wasn't and the lady who sat us didn't even check our reservation.    3rd: I had oraganised a mini surpise for my boyfriend at the hotel. Video play and a birthday cake which was displayed on the big screen on the lounge. Certainly a five star experience.    Key Tip: Can be expesensive if you spend the whole night there. Drinks aren't very heap.    Bad: External staff work within the hotel. The photographer who arrived during the birthday celebration charged us 660 dirham for 12 photos. However told me 60 dirham to print all 12. So I agreed that was fine until he came back and said no he said 660 dirham which is crazy.    He then said I could pay 400 dirham for 6 pictures.. (which is 32pound) for 6 pictures.  We were aware of how much images cost to develop and everything as the machine he printed it on is literally at the back of the lounge.    His answer was its 'sofitel' however he wasn't even a staff of Sofitel.    Was a total rip off. Hotel staff said they have no control over external staff. Its very bad for business when you are being charged 50pounds for 12 photos.    Great experince however disappoint during the celebration.    Great show GREAT singers.    We have visited MANY sofitel around the world. So will be back again!!    Please take pride in external staff the way you do for your own staff.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Au11aud wrote a review Oct 2018,50,Fantastic city hotel with buffet lunch,We came to this hotel with TUI. Initially it was advertised as Sofitel Palais imp√©rial but our rooms were on the side of Lounge and Spa. It was great as the rooms were fully refurbished or very clean as it looked immaculate.  We were 2 families travelling. So we had 4 rooms and they were connecting. It was a bit hard to get the connecting room but we got there at the end.    One of the manager showed me a suite for 3 to 4 people and we will definitely book this one next time we go.    We were a family of 3 and our friends a family of 5. If they would not have travelled with us they could have not got a room for 5. They don‚Äôt allow more than 2 people in 1 doubble room so they should have booked 3 rooms. I think they need to be a bit flexible on this. As in the suite you can easily put 5 people with an extra single bed at an extra charge. This would not heart them.    Also the website does not work very well when you come to add kids in it. The system always kicks you out so this is also something to work on.    Apart from that the bufffet breakfast till 10:30 is great amazing buffet and amazing food. You can eat inside on the terrace or in the garden. Rachida was there every day to serve us and she was lovely and very friendly.    Then we would use the heated swimming pool for families and the amazing sofa sunbed. The pool was great for kids and all the kids played together. Some parents were arguing around the pool which kept us entertained.    As we were half board we had buffet lunch with amazing couscous daily freshly cooked skewers merguez. But you need to ask for it if you don‚Äôt see it. Of course all the type of Mezze and aubergine mezze that I love. As I am french they could add a bit of cheese for lunch and ham :)    Every evening we were out for dinner. Walking distance there is the palace restaurant next to lotus that‚Äôs great. Also the Italian MOD. We also tried the Marrocan at the es Saadi resort which was great.    This hotel is in the main area of Marrakech. We have stayed at Pullman before that is also part of the same group but they could not cook good meat. And we also staying at four season for a change. But Sofitel is the best. We will definitely be back next year.    Another thing they could do to accommodate more the families is allow children in the indoor pool. Maybe not all day but between 2 and 4 or allow some time slots when it‚Äôs cloudy or raining as we did not know what to do when it was cloudy and the outdoor pool was not hot enough to go in.    But the beauty of this hotel outdoor and Indoor is just great.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FehrA1
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,JLWSeattle wrote a review Oct 2018,40,Beautiful setting and poolside; very comfortable rooms,The setting of the resort focusing on the pool/poolside is beautiful the lunch/breakfast area by the poolside is glorious reasonably protected from direct sunlight. The rooms are large and well-laid out and ours had a large balcony with sofas that you could almost live in as well as a beautiful view of the sunrise (for those who are not enjoying the nightlife). For such a new high-end property it's a shame that the elevators are so small and dark that it can be difficult to even select the right floor or find the door open button in a hurry. Service quality issues like a backed-up shower drain on our arrival were quickly fixed. The most maddening problem was that because we were on a prepaid tour we paid for some meals by credit card and the waitstaff repeatedly charged us in US Dollars (to earn the extra fee) even though we asked in both French and English to pay in Dhiram.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Seattle, Washington",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JLWSeattle

To me it's the most beautiful hotel in Marrakesh. The hotel decor is beautifully designed with a Moroccan theme. The rooms are spacious and very clean. The pools were so clean and very well maintained. The entire staff were excellent. We felt so special every day. We especially enjoyed Hassane Fatima Amine Abdlaha Aziz My Youssefe Sana Zanty and Krfi. I highly recommend this hotel. The location was perfect....a few blocks away from the Medina shopping malls and the horse carriages. We will definitely be back and will stay at the Sofitel.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Sina D wrote a review Oct 2018,50,Wonderful oasis,We stayed here in October 2017.  After spending time staying in the hustle and bustle of the medina it was nice to spend a few nights here. There was a stark contrast between how luxurious this part of town is compared to the rest of Marrakech.  The hotel facilities were beautiful with large pool areas and comfortable loungers.  The room was very spacious and tidy with a comfortable bed.  We felt well looked after by the wonderful staff here.  The breakfast was certainly one of the best I've experienced from a sofitel with a huge selection of delicious food.    Platinum perks: upgraded to suite access to the exclusive infinity pool area (we spent most of our time here) fruit bowl welcome amenity (not my favorite) welcome drinks.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Marvin S wrote a review Oct 2018,20,4 star maximum,This hotel is a 4 star maximum. Friendly staff however if you want to relax at the infinity pool as a hotel guest you have to pay 400 dirham. Which is approx 37 EUR per day. Furthermore the room was ok. The tv was hanging with an angle stains on the carpet. I was sleeping on the yardside but there was music every night. Can be good except if you have to sleep. And last but not least i had to leave two nights earlier and the hotel wouldn‚Äôt refund me two nights i have sent an e-mail requesting this but zero response. If the manager reads this don‚Äôt reply with your standard apologies answer get back to me on my e-mail and think with me to at least refund one of the two nights i haven‚Äôt slept in your hotel.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled solo,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarvinRawiS
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Mrs_sanfran88 wrote a review Oct 2018,20,Accor you urgently need to change your gameplan,"The hotel itself is very nice and has a very good location. We had booked a Junior Suite and one Deluxe Double Room but I have never seen a more unfriendly condescending and arrogant Reception and especially concierge in my life. At arrival at the hotel we have been greeted with a gesture to sit down at one of the lounges. The reception was crowded with staff but none of them made an attempt to check us in. So we waited and waited. At some point I just lost my patience so I went up to the reception and asked one of the ladies if she could kindly check us in. All I got was a ""yes yes we will"" but she made no attempts to do so instead she waited for another guy who was still busy with other guest to check us in. We counted six employees plus one concierge behind reception at that point and there is only one person who can check in guest? Seriously?  Later on that night two of us went to the reception again to get some money changed. I know what is coming is my own fault but please learn from my mistakes. We handed the man each 400 DHS to get changed into some smaller bank notes. He counted the money behind the desk and then just threw it in front of us. As I HATE counting money infant of people I just took the money and went to the bar where I counted the money. Here I had to notice that they had only given me 300 DHS although I gave them 400 DHS.  However the unfriendly and most arrogant concierge topped it all. We had different tours booked through our travel agency who left the pick up times with the concierge. So the day before our first trip we went up to the concierge and asked him for the pick up time. He didn't even bother to look if there was a massage but just condescendingly informed us ""No no information!"" So we called our travel agent who informed us that they had called reception two hours ago to inform them about ur pick up time. So the next morning we waited for the pick up and as after 20 minutes no one arrived we called the emergency hotline to ask when we will be picked up and where informed that they had called the hotel again in the afternoon and informed them that the pick up will be later. Nothing of this had been passed on to us.  We played the same game with the concierge again for the next tour after we confronted him that he had received the information but had not passed them on he just sent us away with a hand wave. However 20 minutes later at a quarter to eleven we have been slipped a note under the door with our pickup time. Every time we went up to the concierge his fist questions was did you book through us or agency if you told him that you booked through the agency he made no effort looking at all just straight away said his usual sentence ""No no information for you"" it was just as if they are withholding information from guest who have not been willing to book excursions and trips to their ridiculous high prices.  The service at the Darkum Bar has been very good although the prices are relatively high also compared to other hotels here. However there was one thing that really bugged us. It is without any questions to leave a tip but we do not want to be reminded to leave a tip every time we are handed the bill. By the third day the waiter knew our order by hard and he should have also known that every day we left a tip when we paid the bill. But still every time we have been handed the bill it was handed to us with the addition ""also service charge not included!"" I think this is rather rude to do so every single time.  The service at the pool was a whole other level. Prices are way too high and you have to wait ages for your order. We paid the waiter in cash and waited for the change for over an hour. After asking the waiter several times we just decided to leave it and never pay cash at the pool again.  Breakfast is good but service is very uncoordinated and the are just standing in the way of each other. There are so many employees standing around and orders are constantly passed on from one waiter to another. So how do they expect to get it right in the end? Wa have been waiting for a glas of orange juice for over 30 minutes until we decided to get it ourselves from the service station. Three white collars have been standing on the terrace and watched us but never made any attempt to actually do their job.  If you wanted the minibar to be refilled you literally had to beg at the reception for it. Also there seems to be a difference in service people received when booking a suite or a double room. At the suite we received a turn down service every day shampoo was refilled regularly etc. but not so much at the Double Room. Here after eight days we received the first and only turn down service. Some days the shampoo was not refilled so we had to take the soap cotton pads etc. were at the room. Every gust pays a fair amount of money so at least the amenities in the room should be the same for all guest.  It is a nice hotel but with a lot of room for improvement.",Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Frankfurt, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mrs_sanfran88

But as our room weren‚Äôt ready we decide to go for some lunch in one of the restaurants. Buffet restaurant we was told to be seated and someone would come over. We waited 45 mins and no one came. So went to the bar restaurant and waited 2 hours to be seen to. After placing our order we waited a further hour for a bottle of water to arrived. Followed 20 mins later by food! Not a good start. Finally gets to our room and so disappointed. This hotel states 5star luxury and we booked a superior room. This is a birthday present for my sister. There is nothing superior about this room! There‚Äôs a travel kettle shabby dated furniture. The bathroom is dark tiny and one robe. When I called to ask could we be moved I was told that was the room I‚Äôve paid for!

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,iancoles wrote a review Oct 2018,10,Great location. Very poor service.,First the positives:    Great location within 5 minute walk of the medina and thus convenient for exploring the main sights in Marrakech. Also a short 10 minute taxi ride from the airport ( don‚Äôt pay more than 100 Dirham ).    The pool area is very nice with plenty of beds and lounging areas.    The pool bar / cafe also had a nice lunch menu and staff here were friendly and engaging.    Now for the negatives:    Emails to the hotel prior to arrival required chasing several times to elicit a reply. Taxi transfer from airport was quoted at ¬£50 for 4 of us ( regular taxi is ¬£8 for a 10 minute ride ) I specifically requested non-feather duvets and pillows due to an allergy. I finally got an acknowledgement and confirmation this would be provided but on arrival in room this request had not been fulfilled. A quick call to reception I hoped would resolve matters. Sometime later housekeeping attended to the matter. However later that evening I realised they had simply replaced feather pillows and duvet with  you guessed it feather pillows a duvet. Finally resolved by 1230am.    In general we found the reception staff to be abrupt arrogant and very unhelpful. Restaurant staff at breakfast were similarly inattentive .. we had to ask for coffee rather than it being offered and we got a distinct impression guests were seen as a bit of a nuisance rather than there to be served.    I left feeling that the majority of staff would benefit from some serious customer service training how to smile and engage with guests and proactively seek to meet their needs. I would not recommend this hotel sadly which is unusual for the Sofitel group where elsewhere I‚Äôve have found to be excellent. Marrakech misses the mark by a long long way.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"West Malling, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iancoles

We wanted to pick a top 5* star hotel that would tick all the boxes and we indeed made the right decision. We arrived early and received a very warm welcome. The receptionist had been informed by our travel agent that we went there to celebrate our anniversary and kindly offered a complimentary room upgrade. Great first impression. We were offered a traditional mint tea and were given our room cards. The room was spacious with all necessary amenities and very good balcony view overlooking the pools and restaurants. The staff were fantastic extremely courteous always happy to go the extra mile to please us. The breakfast was second to none. Fantastic wide range fresh omeletes crepes french toasts; simply superb. Their pool service was very slow but if you are okay to chase the waiters a bit it does work. I would not recommend that you buy simple items like water or cokes / snacks from the pool bar as it can be super expensive. There is a local Carrefour where you can literally get them for 1/10 of the price. The pool bar's prices for drinks are unreasonable. Spa seemed lovely but again super expensive. We went for a more traditional option in the Medina that was superb and much cheaper. We decided to have the full Marrakech tour through the hotel and this was a great choice. Their concierge service is really good. Overall a fantastic and very pleasant experience staying at the Sofitel.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,michellemcilveen79 wrote a review Aug 2018,20,Disappointing end to holiday,Hotel is beautiful but at every turn they aim to exploit the tourist by charging extortionate prices for food and drink. But you have a choice to eat and drink their. Our issue was we were charged ¬£10 for three warm 330ml bottles of water delivered to the room. This was not explained at checkin but only when checkin out not part of the mini bar and not even cold. We raised the issue but arrogant staff simply shrugged shoulders and say they would pass on the complaint. Simply a way to exploiting guests very disappointing. Also failed to explain the tourist tax at checkin so you will be billed for this also when checkin out.,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Belfast, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellemcilveen79
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Stefan M wrote a review Aug 2018,20,Low quality standards compared with high price level and arogance,I am a very frequent traveller and have been in alot of different hotels throughout the years. I was very dissapointed from this hotel. We booked a suite and certainly had also high expectations. The size of the suite was very nice but there where things like big ugly stains on the carpet as well as broken washbasins. Things that are completely unacceptable. The general posture of the service staff like concierge etc. is rather snobby and arrogant and not really caring. The price/service-quality ratio was one of the worst I have encountered on my world wide travels. To be fair: I had the same impression of the whole country Morocco.    Good points: The hotel has an impressive and nice pool. So if you do not have overly high expectations and like to hang around the pool this might be a good spot for you. I would not return anyways.,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Mutschellen, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/576StefanM

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,JRW7373 wrote a review Aug 2018,40,Oasis in Marrakech,We had an relaxing time at the Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa over 4 nights the week of July 4th.    The hotel itself is beautiful and we absolutely loved the pool. The pool is surrounded by beds no chairs so you can't help but sprawl out and get comfy as you relax. Also we would get the big bottle of Mojito every day and it was incredible so refreshing.    The service everywhere in the hotel is extremely friendly & helpful. Yes sometimes it takes a while to get someone's attention or for food/drink to get delivered. However that is just their pace and everything they do is done with a smile on their faces.    The trip was truly saved by Adil the concierge though. The hotel had set us up with a third party for VIP airport service that never showed up at our gate to meet us. He got us a cash refund immediately no excuses or questions asked. Then when my wife got sick he arranged to have someone go pick me up food from outside the hotel and went to a pharmacy to get her medicine. He bailed us out multiple times and made the trip run so much smoother when any issues came up. Thank you Adil!    My only complaint is about the food at the pool & room service. We were not very happy with it and they definitely need a better menu for eating in the heat outside. Stick with the fruit which is incredible. That being said their breakfast is amazing as well.    The Sofitel is a great place to relax at after the hustle & bustle of the Old City!,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JRW7373

I found the hotel restaurants very pricey so I'd suggest eating elsewhere. There are loads of restaurants at walking distance and even more within a few minutes by taxi. There are also loads of Riads that you can eat for less than half of the cost with a better variety of local cuisine.  Our rooms were excellent clean renovated new robes with a 5 star quality of sleep.  The service is excellent with smiley and friendly staff.  The pool was good clean (and cold) and the beds and chairs by the pool were ok.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,David Lambrix wrote a review Jul 2018,40,"Excellent Service, Comfortable Rooms, So-so Food",The ambiance upon entering the lobby is relaxing and authentic. Upon arrival a cold towel and hot mint tea arrive before the check-in process. I had booked a Junior Suite via the Sofitel website which is a larger room one per floor. The room is immaculately clean and well kept. The large balcony and sitting area off the bedroom was an especially nice touch. The staff could not have been more polite nor well meaning certainly felt the Moroccan hospitality from nearly everyone.    My only negative feeling was the restaurants inside the resort. It's hard to find value in a 10 Euro glass of iced tea and dry 'spaghetti bolognese' served on penne pasta. These prices far exceed what you'd find in a five star hotel even in the capitals of Europe. Combined with the overall lackluster quality of the food it pushed me to eat outside as much as possible.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Pattaya, Thailand",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidlambrix

We ordered food by the pool after 20 minutes we had to continuously ask where it was after an hour we finally received. When we checked we were requested to provide a card which wasn't a problem. They took ¬£329 for a damage deposit which was fine as we were advised we would get the money back when we checked out. However when we checked out we were advised that we would get the money back within 24 hours. It has now been a week from checking out and I have still not received the amount back. When I called the hotel to find out what is happening I receive poor service and attitude.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,maxinecoraltaylor wrote a review Jul 2018,40,The hotel is in a fantastic location. A 10 minute walk to the Medina or a 5 minute taxi ride.,"The checking in process was excellent. Upon arrival we were given cold towels and mint tea. Perfect.  The swimming pools are super and well maintained. The grounds are lush with lots of herbs and palm trees. Rooms are good and the beds comfortable. There are the facilities in the rooms to make tea/coffee.  The breakfast is good and a vast array of different foods are on offer. The ""english"" tea was not good for me as I prefer strong English breakfast tea. Managed with the mint tea everyday which was fine.  The hotel is undergoing renovations which caused some initial concern as our room was next door to the renovation however I spoke to the customer service manager and was offered a different room which was great but without the view of the pool area.  The staff at the hotel are OK. Their English is poor and I do not speak french.  The service at the pool is poor. We normally had to ask at least 3 times for something Again i think this is the down to the language problem. We did wait 2 hours for a drink by the pool which given the heat was not good.  On our last day a great waiter who is tall with a ponytail and glasses served us. He spoke OK English and delivered great service. I am sorry I cant remember his name.  We did speak to the customer relations lady and she and the hotel appear to be keen to address the poor service and the lack of spoken English.  The hotel offers a variety of resturants and the portions are good.  Was a bit concerned that a milk shake costs more than a G & T. Hey ho first time for everything I suppose.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Larissa A wrote a review Jul 2018,30,Not a five star hotel!!,We went here for our first wedding anniversary my husband mentioned it was our Anniversary over the phone to them and in an email and not one recollection whilst we were here but this is petty in comparison to everything else.    1. No building work was mentioned to us but on arrival they are refurbishing and our room was noisy during the day.  2. Only ONE lift working which we had to share with staff the lift was laughable it was tiny and not brand new for a refurbed part of the building short cuts were taken. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING especially when the lift finally arrives and there isn‚Äôt enough space to share with everybody else that have also been waiting.  3. New grey carpets and tread wasn‚Äôt even placed down correctly so tatty already and they told us only refurbed 3 months ago. Paintwork in communal parts is shoddy one coat literally on everything. Not smart.  4. Temporary breakfast area - again not mentioned and felt untidy with dirty seats and dirty tables.  5. As soon as I arrived I felt this is not a five star experience. Concierge are made to wear brown tatty cheap suits. Not their fault but come on! It‚Äôs meant to be a five star!  6. Service VERY slow heads down but quick enough to hand you the bill!  7. Towels reused by pool area left to dry and then folded back up like new!    If this was a 3* I would understand but Sofitel you need to up your game and cut the slack especially with the high prices you charge for food and wine maybe you should take a look at Es Saadi next door the hotel is of a much higher standard cheaper accommodation and food and drinks are of a much better standard and at a cheaper price too!!,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/652larissaa

We went up to our room which was lovely clean modern everything I was hoping for really.  The first day we went to the pool someone showed us to a bed and gave us towels.  The pool is beautiful.  The next day by the pool we wanted to order a fruit plate and water.  As one of the waiters walked by my boyfriend asked and the guy pretty much ignored him but we thought ok maybe he‚Äôs just busy so 15 minutes later the guy has walked passed us a few times have a laugh with the French people and ignoring us I said excuse me we ordered a fruit plate and he said yeah yeah it‚Äôs coming  Another 5/10 later I went to where the food is coming from and said excuse we order a bottle of water and fruit plate nearly half and hour ago and nothing I would mind if someone came and spoke to us but it was like we were aliens after a very expensive but not existiant fruit plate came defiantly not worth the wait!!!!  At breakfast the next morning we went down for breakfast I‚Äôm vegan so of course there was not much for me to eat but I asked if I could get a morrocan salad but I just got looked at like I should speak French.  So I thought of I‚Äôll go and get vegetables and make my own salad but the tomatoes were old bit fresh so I asked if I could have some fresh tomatoes and of course I waited and waited while the waiter walks passed it‚Äôs like I didn‚Äôt ask him it was strange  I felt so angry as I was hungry and we were going out for the whole day so I wanted a good breakfast.

The hotel stands bright and shiny on the Marrakech skyline - we were very excited to checkin there while we waited on our flight the next day. The checkin was very nice and the young lady very professional (she even noticed us around the corner and greeted us on her way home). The smell of this hotel was VERY BAD they have what seems to be several hundred scent diffusers throughout the hotel - if this isn't bad enough they are in the room. It was horrible - we had a few rooms and everybody complained. The hotel itself was dirty - the remote control the toilets the carpets the walls - just not enough attention to this kind of thing for a hotel at this level. The bed was also very bad - it's some sort of air mattress that had us all slanted and almost rolling into the floors. Again we had several rooms so it was not just one problem.

Our room was very nice with a typical Moroccan style. We then went to the pool which is amazing as it is such a big variety of couches/chairs/beds. Luckily when we went the hotel was not very packed and rather empty so we could chose and change during the day where we wanted to lie which was perfect. However the service at the pool is not the best. There is one person for the huge facilities which means you need to open you own umbrella and need to figure out how to use the umbrella and tie the knot. We then went to the Pool restaurant where we asked for a bottle of Rose where the waiter then said can I see your ID while pulling my ID out I asked what the drinking age in Morocco is and he answered ""20 I think"" and after looking at my age (19) he said ""yeah 20"" and then I googled the drinking age and it was 18 he just didn't want to serve us alcohol. And in general a lot of staff was very impolite However at the same time there are few staff which is extraordinarily polite and nice. The same staff that denied me the alcohol later stepped on my foot while I was sitting down and he didn't excuse himself. Also the concierge was a very nice man and recommend many stuff however some of the places he sent us to were closed without him knowing.

The food by the pool was pretty good but was cold by the time it got to me it was no big deal though I was on vacation mode. I was thinking of extending my stay and went to the front desk The gentleman there (not the one who checked us in) was kind of rude when I asked the price as if I couldnt afford it LOL. Rude. I did not catch his name but he was working at the front desk on the morning of- May 26th on the left side of the desk ( not the concierge) He didn't even make eye contact with me while he was talking he kept writing on a paper when I asked the rate. Very rude arrogant guy. Other than that the Pool was great as well but there was no Hot tub. There was something that looked like a hot tub  but it was filled with cold water. It would be really goof if there was a hot tub there's enough space for it. Also our housekeeping didn't show up until we called the front desk not sure why. Other than that everything was great!!

Around nine o'clock we came for dinner and the weighter offered us a buffet for 40‚Ç¨ each. We asked him how long the buffed will be open and he said until midnight twelve o'clock. We went to the buffet took a plate and sat down on the table outside just five minutes later I went inside again to take something else to eat and the whole buffet was gone just after five minutes!! I asked the weighter about the time as he said midnight and he said he is sorry but the buffet ends now but if we want something he can ask for it in the kitchen. We tried to explan that we took the buffet to enjoy dining and choose from different meals but he said that's all he can do. than he left and didn't come back again. He didn't offer us anything for compensation and we had to pay together 80‚Ç¨ for actually two small plates of food.  Besides that the food was completely cold very fatty and old.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,ClubEight wrote a review May 2018,40,Looks terrific at night,We stayed here for 3 nights as a large touring group. We arrived at night and the hotel looked fantastic lit up. The negative is that the hotel sprawls over a large site so corridors go forever and it takes some time to get to your room. Our superior room was basic but did have a small balcony. The grounds including pool and breakfast area were beautiful and we were close to all sightseeing. A must is a trip from here to the Atlas Mountains. A big negative was dinner upstairs which then turned out to be outside and cold. It was the French restaurant but the food was definitely not French. Staff were rude food was average and we had to ask many times for the heaters to be turned on.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,shahvirp wrote a review May 2018,20,Great Property Horrible Service,I booked the suite at the hotel. The room was extremely nice however the service throughout my stay was extremely disappointing. Toiletries were not refreshed laundry bags were not replaced on one of the days the do not disturb sign was removed and never came back. The most disappointment can when it was raining one of the nights I requested the hotel personnel standing with umbrellas to help me with an umbrella to my car and they refused and said I needed to go to concierge and take their permission which was ridiculous. I finally chose to sprint to my car. On my return that night I had a similar experience I had an elderly lady and a 8 month old kid in the car. The hotel staff refused to help with an umbrella to usher them into the hotel. After I went in and had to raise my voice I finally got some assistance. Even after this no one came to assist me with my luggage. After this incident I called for the hotel manager to visit my room and highlighted all the issues. He assured me that everything would be sorted out going forward. To my surprise absolutely nothing improved. Toiletries were still not refreshed the laundry bag still not replaced nor the do not disturb sign returned.  I doubt I will every stay at this resort again.,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Kuwait City, Kuwait",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shahvirp

During checkin a lovely receptionist that I would like to recognize Chaimaa saw that my wife was pregnant so made sure we don't have to wait for room and gave us a close room to reception and pool to avoid long walks for my wife. She was very sweeet. Also as thoughtful is the reservation lady Hanane who checked the system and saw that I change room so she called me to make sure I am happy with the new choice That's what I call great service!  the rest is good rooms are with nice amenities. breakfast is top notch  What I always find dissapointing is food service by pool. it has been poor for few years now you have to walk to the waiters to get them to help you slow service and waiters look like they hate their jobs and are tired.,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Casablanca, Morocco",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Habibamine

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Samantha H wrote a review May 2018,50,Perfect stay,We have recently returned from an 8 night stay and we couldn't have been happier with this hotel. Booking months in advance we got a really good deal on Expedia for a junior suite but after reading all the reviews regarding service I thought I had made a massive mistake but they must have just been unlucky. The hotel is spotless as was our room which was cleaned and restocked every day we even had housekeeping additionally knock every evening to ask if we needed anything. It is a big hotel but there were plenty of beds and seating around the pool to accommodate everyone. The staff at the Oasis poolside restaurant were incredibly attentive and courteous whether they were serving you at the restaurant or bringing drinks to your sunbed.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,raijaleena wrote a review Apr 2018,40,It was like coming to a paradise,From the first moment I met the first hotel employee I felt really welcome. And when I saw my room I did really like everything in it. The bed the night lights free in-room mineral water the shower the bathrobe the slippers everything. Everything was working and it was so clean and so quiet. After a long day it was like the dot above the letter i when the evening lady Fatima came to turn my room down leave me peaceful night tea and wish me good night.  The only thing missing in the room was facial tissues but it did cost me only 075 euros to buy them in the nearby grocery shop.    The buffet breakfast was excellent nothing was missing. I think there might have been even 20 different breads even dark ones which I prefer. All the cooking personnel were really friendly and helpful. Only the server personnel could be better. First I thought that it was only me to whom they were not so friendly but then I noticed that in the next table there were some business men and they had ordered some coffee. Later they tried to ask when the coffee will come but the waiter did not recognize them. They were in a hurry so they stood up and stood there a while waiting. At the end they left. The coffee came long after they had left and then the waiter just wondered where they had gone. The waiters were really slow. Can not imagine what the situation will be at rush hours as I was always in early morning when the breakfast room was not yet full.  There were many swimming pools I did use only the heated one in the garden. It was so nice to swim there whether it was sunny or rainy and even when the air was not so warm.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,DimaDubai wrote a review Apr 2018,30,Deluxe Room,We stayed in a Deluxe Room with King Size bed on the first floor over looking one of the pools and above the restaurant.    Pros:  1-Excellent location. You can walk to many cafes & popular restaurants. Also Jema3 Fena is very close by as well as Koutoubia etc...  2- Gardens and Pool are spectacular.  3- Room is modern and new with all amenities  4- Pillows and comforter as well as bed are very comfortable    Cons  We were woken up at 7am the first day with loud knocking and the second morning we woke up again very early because we were located on the first floor above the restaurant. Loud continuous banging. It was not a relaxing stay we were there to celebrate my husband‚Äôs Birthday and sleep in instead we were up very early and not very happy with the room. Also when they grilled in the restaurant we smelled it in the room.  1-Room is very small with tiny closet space  2-Bathroom is very cramped with a shower and wash basin and W/C is in a separate tiny space with a door. Very difficult walking around & sharing the space.  3-A few Light fixtures were not working.  4- Floor tiles weren‚Äôt that clean.  5- Maids left our pillows on the floor after they cleaned the room  6- It doesn‚Äôt feel like a 5 star service as there was no chocolate on the pillow or roses as with other 5 star Hotels in Marrakech they cleaned the room once and that was it.  7-Water in the shower kept getting really hot. Not a good shower for a child  8-Tried the downstairs bar/cafe on the lobby terrace. Waiters were unavailable and we kept having to call them over. Finally got up and paid the bill but no one was around at the register.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Boston, Massachusetts",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DimaDubai
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Bartot02 wrote a review Apr 2018,20,Poor service,I am not one for writing reviews and my husband and I are pretty easy going when it comes to these things. However we were really not impressed with this hotel and do not consider it to be deserving of it‚Äôs 5 stars. It looks beautiful and the breakfast was amazing. There was more choice of things to eat than you could expect each morning and everything was fresh. The pools were also quite inviting even though one was freezing cold. These are the main good points about the hotel. We could have put up with the fact that the food wasn‚Äôt that great at the restaurant in the evening or that the lift was broken or that our toilet leaked or that we found random toast on our balcony when we hadn‚Äôt eaten any toast but what we couldn‚Äôt put up with was the terrible service! The toast we found was never cleaned up. Sometimes our room wasn‚Äôt cleaned at all even if we were out all day and left the sign on the door to ask for it to be cleaned. Service was extremely slow whenever food or drinks were involved and staff were very rude to us and to each other. The first night one member of staff at the restaurant kept shouting at the other staff all of whom moved around a lot but never seemed to know what they were doing. During every meal or drink all we saw were staff arguing with each other or discussing things without actually doing very much because often people didn‚Äôt seem to know who was doing which job. By the third day we finally got good service at breakfast and there seemed to be some sort of organisation but it was never consistent in the 5 days we stayed at the hotel. People were rude perhaps because our French wasn‚Äôt very good but we did at least try and persevered rather than speaking only in English. I also asked for a hairdryer which was supposed to be included with our room and we were told I could have my hair dried at the Spa by one woman at the front desk. The following day I asked another employee and he said it‚Äôs in the draw. When we said it wasn‚Äôt there he said he would get one and it never arrived. These things made our stay very disappointing. It seems we were staying in the new side of the hotel which was only just finished so we understand it may have some problems like the leaky toilet and wall paint that was splattered places due to a quick finish and this would be acceptable. But it seems that this hotel can not cater for the amount of people that stay at the hotel and service was a great disappointment. I hope that once they get used to the new building being open the staff at this hotel will settle into what they doing. I would not stay here again or recommend it to anyone. I would recommend staying in Essouriara! Lovely people everywhere.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Canterbury, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bartot02

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,shogunturi wrote a review Apr 2018,40,Stylish resort,Sofitel is a very good place to spend a few days and enjoy nearby Marrakech attractions on foot. Major city hot spots are never more than 2km away and conveniantly and safely reachable. The outside pool area is designed attractively clean and well served. A very decent pool with lots of seating places around.  Breakfast is truly high class lot‚Äôs of fruits and local products assorted around different bars. Waiting lines are never too long. Service (all drinks as cafe tea water and juices are served to the table) is quick and friendly.  I specially liked the spa/gym area. There is a hammam where they offer different treatments for extra charge. The well equipped gym (with state of the art techno gym equipment) is free.  The restaurants are ok and offer beside local food a good selection of international stuff. There are also countless good eating places in the vicinity. They do serve alcohol everywhere in the hotel.  The rooms (I was in 66) however show that the place is quite old. Altough relatively spacy and very clean I missed some little things like hooks for cloth or something to put the suitcase on. There are only two small closets left and right of the TV (TV is big and good). In the bathroom is not one possibility to hangup a used towel or put on the soap in the showercabin. Taking a shower overfloods the whole bathroom because there is no showercabin door. Beds and linen are supergood quality.  Also good thing is the extra room for the toilette and the private balcony with a lounge.  Wifi is free and available troughout the whole place including outside area.  Overall absolutely worth the price next time I would choose a room upgrade.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Lachen, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shogunturi

Took breakfast just across the street at a nice cafe (La Table du Marche) and dinners were in the town as no options available in the hotel at night. Staff very pleasant and welcoming. When booking excursions from the concierge clarify exactly what is included in the price as we found there were a number of extras in the day that hadn't been explained.

Extra water was provided each night for free with the turn down service.    All of the staff we met were polite and helpful but not at all invasive.    The breakfast buffet was really good with a huge range of options from toast and cereal through to local delicacies.    The only reason that I wouldn't have offered 5 stars is due to the lack of dining opportunities in the evenings. The restaurants are all very formal and the buffet option was restricted to groups/events which left little choice if you were after anything other than a formal meal or room service. It would have been great to have been able to eat at the lovely poolside bar where we enjoyed drinks next to the fire pits.

This level of service at breakfast compared very unfavourably with all other areas where it was exemplary.    Check-in was easy. Our room was beautiful. The shared areas internally and externally were stunning. Food and wine though expensive were very good.    Evening entertainment at dinner was of a very high standard.

Also there is a tax to pay for each nights stay approx five pounds a day. When asking about the bill and taxes the male receptionist was very unhelpful in his explanation and made no apology for the extra items we were charged for.

We were very satisfied of the welcome we had from staff and in particular we were mostly happy of the availability and good advices of the Concierge Hadil. Breakfast is more than enjoyable as well (lots of choices and quality of food).

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,RajeevNagpal wrote a review Jan 2018,10,Not worth it,Although located very centrally this hotel is very old and has rooms spread around inconveniently.  Lobby looks good on pictures but the furniture is old and needs replacement. At check in we were given wet towels but they were not very pleasant to smell.    Checking in was easy and staff was good but the room was not worth a 4 star rating. Toilet seat had scratches and rooms had dim lite and I understand that may have been intentional.    Restaurant was good and had good choices. But overall if you are looking for a grand experience in Morocco this is not the place.,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Chicago, Illinois",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RajeevNagpal
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,cahibner wrote a review Jan 2018,20,Only good for heavy smokers!,Maybe the mistake was mine... I should have read before booking that the Hotel is huge I mean really big! And this is something I don't like in hotels. You fell like you are in a busy train station at rush hour all the time! The lobby is big noisy busy and with a lot of people smoking. When I say a lot I mean A LOT! We got there at 4:30 pm and the room wasn't ready. Strange as the check out when you have to leave is 12:00. Anyway it didn¬¥t take long to get into the room. And then the nightmare started... The room was old and outdated with a heavy decoration and dirty carpet but the worst of it was the smell!!! I thought I was inside an ashtray!!! Horrible cigarette smell! The following day I asked the reception if we could change the room due to the smell. They showed us another room but the smell was the same. In fact the whole place smelled like that. Maybe I am not used to people smoking everywhere anymore because where I live it is not allowed. But there it seems that not only it was allowed but it was incentivated.  My husband suffers from rhinitis and the whole experience was just awfull.  The pool area is nice but again always crowded with people. Staff is polite but not kind and service in general is very slow. Breakfast offers many choices of food. Definetly do not recommend this place!,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,S√£o Paulo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cahibner
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Shamit P wrote a review Jan 2018,40,March break 2017...,8 of us stayed here for my friends stag week back in March 2017. Wonderfully set in Marrakech's 'Hivernage' district. We were within walking distance of the opulent Four Seasons La Mamonia Palace Hotel Palais Jad Mahal (Restaurant) and the world famous Jemaa el-Fanaa Market Square.    Rooms were very nicely set and pleasant as was the reception area and poolside areas of the grounds.    Food & drink here is very expensive compared to other places I have been in the world but it's the Sofitel and I wasn't expecting it to be bargain basement. Service from reception staff and hotel ground staff was really pleasant and we were treated very well during our stay.    As we had many facilities available nearby we felt that we had picked the best location for our budget at the time.    We were there when the temperature was climbing to 25-29 degrees so missed the 30 plus mark by a week.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Romford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shamitp2014

Even something as simple as a vegetarian Curry and rice are not available. You do get tagine but very bland food. Basically boiled vegetables and rice or couscous.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,EmKay1983 wrote a review Nov 2017,10,One of the worst hotels I've ever stayed in,Arrived on Friday 24th of Nov with two other couples (our friends); we checked in slightly later than them. We were allocated a horribly positioned room in an external building where the building work was ongoing and our view was the building work; meanwhile our friends were upgraded complimentary to pool side views. I asked to also be upgraded but was told no other rooms were available; the bed was nice but the shower was blocked the water was just 'Luke warm' there was no bidet in the toilet (toilet/bathroom were separate). I complained about the blocked shower and a plumber was sent to the room to report back to the reception staff; I waited for them to change my room but absolutely NOTHING was done about it! The staff were rude and unhelpful.  Whilst me and my friends were sitting in the restaurant area during breakfast service had finished but we were just chilling out. We asked for a bottle of water which we said we'd pay for but all the waiters could say was sorry service has finished and then they offered us an open bottle of water from when were serving!  We then thought lets go to the spa; to our surprise we were told even if we are staying at the hotel we must pay for the spa ie the sauna jacuzzi steam room. That in itself was shocking! I have never stayed at ANY spa hotel where these basic spa facilities have to be charged for!  Everything is a NO for the staff..

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,gmcc57 wrote a review Nov 2017,40,"Excellent facilities, but overpriced food and drink",A short surprise break here and a review of the comments made since makes for an interesting read in hindsight. The staff could not have been more welcoming throughout. Every member said hello in passing from the bellboys through to the reception staff (so I do not recognise some of the comments made) English was widely spoke and no issues noted.  The room (483) was well appointed with a large bowl of fruit on arrival and a vase of red roses brought in shortly after. The bed was enormous and very comfortable! Separate toilet and bath/shower were adequate with toiletries bathrobes & slippers.  The swimming pools are surrounded by cushioned loungers couches and hammocks (incl baby sized ones). All in all a very pleasant experience.  Food and drink-wise was less so in terms of pricing but one cannot fault the quality. Breakfast priced at ¬£25 each (basically unlimited buffet) failed to compete with other local outlets (eg Cafe ExtraBlatt 100m away) on price.It is highly unlikely that you could eat enough to justify the cost. Clearly convenience has a price. Similarly dinner had great food and ambience but was pricey. Overall a great stay nevertheless.,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gmcc57
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,cadidevile wrote a review Nov 2017,30,Service has really changed for the worse,I have been staying here for the last 4 years and have enjoyed the hotel. I recommend this place to friends. This last stay was not so good. The service is was terrible (in the restaurants pool and even check out) The issue is not the lack of staff members but the lack of them taking care of the clients. I see alot of them running around or just talking to themselves while you wait. We waited over an hour after we ordered drinks for anyone to come back and ask if we needed anything else. No one came so we needed to flag someone down. When you ordered bottles of Wine they would come back and continue to provide service - not just drop it off and never come back. At checkout - was not even asked how our staff was. I finally talked to the manager and she was very polite and I understand she would of taken care of it but it was our last day. I will update my review next time I go as I will give it one more chance - if not i will move my business to another hotel.,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Athens, Greece",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cadidevile
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Zentrav wrote a review Nov 2017,30,Nice but not worth the price,Just finished a 3 night stay at the Sofitel. Rooms (beds amenities size beds bedding showers etc) all excellent (we stayed in a newly furnished room. You need to walk through the dining area to get to your room which is odd. The spa is gorgeous but we did not have time for a service. Shopping at boutiques (local designer max & Jan clothing very reasonably priced). Service needs a lot of help especially the front desk which is staffed by arrogant non-empathetic people ( even the concierge seemed indifferent to helping meet your needs). Notable people are Yousef (tall doorman with braces) Hamid in room service (who miraculously got us a 3pm checkout even when all front desk staff said 12) and Elayti at the pool restaurant. The breakfast is $25/person and generic/basic food (not really great but worth it for the convenience). One night we wanted to have a night cap at the bar near the lobby after dinner. We literally had to flag down a waiter after sitting for 10 minutes another 10 minutes to get our drinks and we had to go find the waiter to pay (we were 1 of only 3 other tables that evening). The pool area is lovely with plenty of seating (there is a private pool for an extra 400DAM per person) and service there is just as bad as everywhere else.  Location is 5 min drive from M√©dina. La Mommonia is in the M√©dina and the Les Orangiers are both better options than Sofitel.,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Boston, Massachusetts",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zentrav
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,karims1 wrote a review Nov 2017,40,Amazing breakfast! But some services need to improve...,The Sofitel in Marrakech turned out to be a good choice though it was a challenge to get the front desk to change our room. The deluxe room we had did not have a comfortable easy chair which I needed for my backache and so we upgraded to a mini-suite to have the benefit of a sofa chair. This upgrade was a challenge ‚Äì but it eventually was sorted out by the helpful and dedicated Ibitissam at the front desk. The hotel only had the much more expensive ‚Äúsophisticated‚Äù suites available for the next 2 days after which we could then get the mini-suite we wanted. The suite we moved to referred to as a sophisticated suite is simply not worth it. It is a lot of space and mostly wasted space offering minimal benefits. When we were eventually moved to the mini-suite we had a lovely room with a comfortable easy chair and well proportioned space. The front desk at the Sofitel can be a challenge ‚Äì it took numerous attempts to sort out the change in our room ‚Äì but the room we finally ended up with was worth the effort and hassles.    To illustrate the shortcomings of the Sofitel an urgent international package had been delivered for me at the Sofitel. The package had arrived on Saturday in the hotel the same day we checked in. No mention was made of a package arriving for me when I checked in. On Monday I asked the Front Desk of the Sofitel but they could not find any package for me. I then checked with the courier company and they confirmed that it has definitely been delivered to the Sofitel. Eventually on Tuesday when I checked with concierge he found the package in a cupboard. Amazingly this hotel has no way of recording received packages for guests and does not keep track to ensure they hand over packages timeously. As a result it takes the hotel 3 days to pass urgent courier packages to its guests.    However the kitchen at the Sofitel wins a prize for its amazing service! Breakfast was outstanding. I have never seen so many options in any buffer breakfast ‚Äì it even had about 5 different cakes numerous pastries and egg options. The chef a serious-looking large man eager to please did his rounds in the morning personally checking the various breakfast offerings. On day 2 I asked him if the kitchen could make a Moroccan flat bread with onions and chilli ‚Äì and within minutes he was giving the kitchen orders. A few minutes later 2 lovely Moroccan flatbreads arrive exactly as requested. As if that was not impressive enough the next morning these special mode-to-order flatbreads arrived on the table shortly after our arrival at breakfast even before we could submit a request!

Only annoying thing people reserve their lounge beds early morning and then leave for the most part of the day.

Check in a bit interesting as they make you wait and come to you rather than at desk not sure why. Taxi stand in front of hotel ‚Ç¨5 to get you nearly anywhere in the city probably less if you really bargain. The main square is about 20 minute walk but you will only go there once too touristy.

The receptionist Chamime (not sure if that's the correct spelling) was such a delight. She went above and beyond her job description to make sure we had a memorable experience and were forever sold to the Sofitel chain of hotels. We were welcome to our room where we had a tray of fresh fruits and dried snacks and while we were gone for dinner she had our room decorated with the most beautiful arrangements of flowers and candles I could have ever imagined! She always made us feel welcome when she saw us entering and even on the last night had our room decorated with flowers for our last night.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Dhruv P wrote a review Sep 2017,20,Worst service at a 5* ever,"What can I say. What a fantastic hotel. Well done to Accor hotels. Unfortunately I cannot rate my experience at this hotel as 5* as the service and attitude of 80% of the staff was absolutely disgraceful.    I've worked with 5* hotels top restaurants and bars around the MENA region and to date have never experienced such horrendous service by the staff. It seemed as though many of the staff either were not happy to work there or had an issue with our group. If you want good reliable hard working staff please do speak to me; I know hundreds of hospitality staff that would be willing to provide 5* services to their guests.    A couple of examples to set the tone would be making us wait at a table for 20-25mins just to take an order even though we had asked 2 people on 3 times we were ready to order even though there were more staff than customers at the poolside cafe/restaurant. Upon asking to speak to the manager of the outlet I was abruptly asked ""why?"" by a waiter!! I didn't realise I had to justify myself.    Food that we had ordered on a number of occasions was stone cold at the same poolside restaurant and also one evening when we ordered from room service.    Language here is definitely a barrier if you do not speak French as they really do act ignorant towards foreigners. It wasn't until we spoke a bit of French that the message was understood but even then the standards of service were far too relaxed and extremely moody.    Also the concierge in a hotel is supposed to be a responsible and respected position. Unfortunately the ones at Sofitel Marrakech have no idea as to what the guests are looking for and we were directed to some very quiet and romantic places even though we were 6 males. They have no idea of decent bars and restaurants in the area and we had to do most of the research ourselves.    All in all the GM Ahmed Benkirane really needs to up the game of his staff. This is why I will not be staying here again when I come for a longer 5 night stay in November.    When a complaint was made at the reception regarding the service standards and how the group was treated we were only offered a 30% discount on anything charged to one of the rooms. Between 6 people ¬£200 just doesn't really cut it especially when you've each spent close to ¬£850 for just flights and accommodation.    Service really has let down this hotel and being an international brand Accor need to take this seriously because you don't know who will walk in to your hotel and what type of service they are used to. Training needs to be given to all staff and a knowledgeable concierge team. I am also a strong believer that many of the staff at this hotel Base their level of service by judging looks of the guests.

They may try to stick you there even if you have your booking on the Lounge side! The rooms are not that great but the main restaurant (particularly for breakfast) and Lounge and pool areas are exceptionally amazing. The hotel is about a 15-minute historical walk to the city center    Positives  + the Sofitel lounge side had amazing exterior decor (outside of the rooms) and a very nice centralized area  + breakfast was huge with both Western French and Moroccan specialties  + great pool scene and pool parties however they start later in the afternoon around 4pm (kid friendly too)  + generally the staff and service personnel were helpful (with the exception of one pool server who was trying to pick fights with hotel guests)  + Sofitel concierge was quite helpful and we preferred the hotel to trying our luck with local operators  + comfortable beds with good sleeping material    Negatives  - despite making a booking for a lounge and specific room type the late night check-in staff tried on multiple occasions to put us in the wrong room location (palace side)  - late night check in staff seemed to create more problems than resolutions. For example we had booked a particular room but he kept selecting something else so I had to physically point out what we had booked on his screen  - people were smoking in rooms and even though we were not it was seeping into ours and smelling massively bad (and disgusting)  - interior decor was falling apart and needs to be refurbished  - room wasn't very clean and of the Sofitel standards  - there was a nasty stench that came into the room  - flies were everywhere in restaurant  - when we left the hotel various people would engineer situations where they pretended to be casually walking in a similar direction,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,International Traveler,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ARK_Travelers
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,The Popats wrote a review Aug 2017,20,Trying to be a five star hotel,We booked this hotel for our one year wedding anniversary. Upon arrival the staff were very helpful and gave us what they called an 'upgrade' to our room as it was our anniversary. However the room was on the 'old' side of the hotel which was a fair walk away from the pool and amenities and had a balcony which you would struggle get 2 people on! so we requested to change which they dealt with ok but only the could manage it on the 2nd night.  The complete let down of this hotel is the service. It's by fair the worst we've experienced. Staff appear as if they don't want to be there by pushing each other to serve your table.    We had dinner at the SO lounge on the first night and there were only 3 tables eating that night but it still took absolutely ages to get served. Drinks kept being forgotten and all you could see were staff standing around not knowing what to do.    Each night it would take us almost 30min to get a drink at the bar (when there were only a handful of guests in there) and just as long to get the bill and be able to leave.    They couldn't even manage to get us currency exchange when we needed it because 'they didn't have the key to the drawer'    Our new room was on the refurbished side which they are still working on so is extremely nosey with the workmen.    The cleanliness of the hotel should be questioned. On several occasions we saw room service trays left in the corridor by the lifts and the staff wouldn't clear it for days making the leftover food go mouldy (see pictures).    As our flight back was in the evening they offered us a room to shower and change in later so we could use the pool etc for the day. We were reassured 3 times we would have access to a room. But when it came to it they couldn't find one for us and said we had to use the SPA facilities which would've been ok if they staff there weren't so rude either and if they showers there didn't have cockroaches!

The breakfast was a wonderful spread to cater for all pallets but what we won't forget is the wonderful service by the staff serving there! Fatima waited on our tables dutifully with a smile and had an impressive memory for what our requests were day to day and had them ready on our table without being asked. She was extremely friendly and attentive. Breakfast with a smile was dutifully served by Rida who made our eggs nicely to order a very happy Fatima who works hard at the Moroccan breakfast corner and Galitte who served our kids crepes made to order each day!  The kitchen staff worked tirelessly to make sure that we had a pleasant experience each day and I have to mention the two gentlemen who worked hard to provide smoothies of our choice each day no matter how busy it was I only regret not taking their names too!  All in all it was a wonderful welcoming experience staying there.  The rooms in the Imperial are somewhat a bit dated in areas but do have that essence of style that make up for it!  Would definitely stay there again!

The lobby and pool area are beautiful the rooms are nice and beds are comfortable. Breakfast was excellent as was lunch at the pool restaurant. The neighborhood around the hotel has a lot of nice restaurants and nightlife and it's a short walk to the medina and other historical sites in Marrakesh.    The only downsides were that the hotel is under renovation so there is some noise and some of the common areas are not as nice as they could be.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,ablange90 wrote a review Jul 2017,30,"Average, some disappointments",Attractive hotel from the outside that features a wonderful pool area spa gym and attentive staff in the lobby who don't hesitate with assisting you with your bags etc. However - we arrived at the hotel around 11pm after travelling all day we were greeted by a pleasant lady who informed us she couldn't find our booking on their systems immediately this slightly concerned us as the thought of not having a hotel for the night in the centre of Marrakech wasn't what we had anticipated. After about 20 minutes and a few grunts and sighs later she informed us that she had found it and asked for the relevant documents passports etc. Then to our surprise she asked that we hand over 7000MAD incase we use any of the facilities within the hotel and then the cost would be deducted from the total - I handed over my card and she assured me the cost wouldn't be taken until departure if we had used any extras that the hotel had to offer which made complete sense. However she then went ahead and created a payment of 7000MAD which came off my debit card instead of having it as a deposit she reassured me she would refund it at the end of our stay if appropriate. After about another 20 minutes this was resolved and we were then told about the tax per person per night that we had to pay upfront. All I would say is make sure you read the small print for this hotel as they charge for absolutely everything and anything. Finally we were taken to our room (about a 10-15 minute walk from the lobby/pool area a slight inconvenience) it was pleasant well presented and tidy however slightly dated and definitely didn't reflect any of the rooms advertised on their website. The room was clearly a part of the old not yet refurbished area of the hotel. Sunrise came and a couple of hours later we made our way down for breakfast a pleasant varied selection of pastries fruit cooked breakfast options and pancakes which we were certainly pleased with. After breakfast we returned to our room and sat on the balcony to admire the views of the Atlas Mountains and suddenly we noticed a man appear from the bushes below who then began to pleasure himself in front of us whilst making direct eye contact. Surprised and slightly concerned we headed back into our room and drew the curtains. We then headed to the pool area a large attractive area with big beds and bright red towels and cushions. Again everything is extremely overpriced you will be paying ¬£5 for a can and for alcoholic beverages you're looking at ¬£10-¬£20 a drink. All in all ok hotel not up to Sofitel standards. If you're planning on staying here advise a member of staff on arrival that you would prefer a newly refurbished room (to avoid the slightly dated side of the hotel and getting wanked at from below your balcony),Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ablange90

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,SIMO H wrote a review Jul 2017,30,"Great location, mediocre rooms",The entrance of this hotel is impressive. It's also perfectly located in the heart of Marrakech.  However the first room I was given was small old and noisy. It looked like a cheap 3 stars hotel room. After I complained I was given a room in the supposedly renovated part of the hotel. The room was newer but far from the standards of a 5 stars hotel.  To summarise it's not worth the price they are charging. Stay there if you get a good deal and you want a perfect location. If you want to experience a true 5 stars hotel there are plenty of other options....,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simoh346

Reda (the concierge) could not have done more to make our stay as great as it was. His advice on where to go what to see how much we should pay etc. was perfect for our needs. He looked after us everyday including arranging a private driver for the day. We would suggest anyone staying at the hotel to pop down for a chat with Reda!    We had a beautiful room (free upgrade) with amazing views across the olive groves. Breakfasts were delicious and varied although the staff were inconsistent in attentiveness.    The pool area was fantastic although allowing guests to blast their own music from portable speakers was not relaxing and detracted from the otherwise lovely morrocan music piped through the trees.    The 'so lounge' food and service was 'just ok' as was the pool food but the Lawrence bar was much better.    Marrakesh in general was a super place - the people were so welcoming and friendly. We felt safe and well looked after everywhere we went.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Zara K wrote a review Jul 2017,40,Nice hotel just not amazing for toddler's,The hotel is close to the airport 30 min drive.  On arrival we had nice cuppa tea and check in was simple. We was then taken to our room.  Room 87 nice size for two adults and one toddler ground floor nice decor. The bed is a bit too soft but hay each to their own.  To get to pool there is a back way from the back door of our room however you then leave your room open. So the longer way was back past reception. Pool was nice and big bit chilli but fine once u got in. We didn't know until our last day that there was a baby pool which was heated. Staff could have been more helpful in showing us around. Breakfast was simple but nice and fresh. However the restaurants didn't open until 7.30pm and having a toddler who needed dinner around 5.30/6pm was an issue as we then had to have room service all 4 days racking up a bill of ¬£240.    Another down was using the hotel concierge services there was no booklet to have a look so prices where not fixed. We booked a tour to the mountain which was 1400mad around ¬£140. The drive was 1hr and a half. We was told food and water was including which wasn't the driver got water on the way but made out it was on him. And food we got dropped at restaurant then had to pay the bill being on holiday fine you pay but it's the principle of what we were sold. The tour guide / driver dropped use to another guide who took us up the mountain he was really good BUT the walk / climb was not for children or anyone who can't do a big mountain hike. The guide was good and we didn't make it to the main point as it was way busy and a Sunday even he said it would be hard for him. So all in all I didn't think it was perfect trip my cousin had a driver for 100 pound and seem to have had a much different trip. We also stopped at some point of interest. All in all we spent another 100 pound on the day.    We got a taxi to the market one day which is 25mad only 15min drive so good. On the way back we got a horse which we haggled down to 75mad  The staff at the hotel are all really nice I would just say around the pool it's hard to call someone from the bar to get drinks.    I think all in all good hotel but restaurant opening and concierge advice service was a big let down. The hotel did have buggies and high chairs and car seats to hand at the door which was nice however no one knows how to fit the car seat.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zarak847

I have have read some not so good reviews but whilst i'm sure the reviews are honest I can only say that I had a good 2 nights here. I must say that the other people I know staying here at the same time (more than 5) all shared the same view. I booked a suite and it was enormous with everything you need and plenty that you don't but is still nice to have. The two main pools are fantastic. You have a choice of temperatures depending on how you like it and a large spa pool as well. There is a very nice but pricey poolside restaurant and several bars. If I had one suggestion it would be to get the waiters to ask people by the pool if they want drinks. You'll sell a shedload of them in 40 degree heat. Generally service was good and the only downside if there was one is that the Medina is still a mile away. Cheap taxi ride but not to walk in that heat. Close to the airport though so that was a bonus. Very nice restaurant around the corner with entertainment (Jad Mahal) I would stay here again if I'm in Marrakech.,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled on business,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/freestyletravel
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Sarah B wrote a review Jun 2017,30,Stunning but shame very poor service,We decided to have a pool day as we were staying in a Riad in the centre. It cost 400 Dirhams per person around ¬£32 each which I was happy to pay. The pool area was beautiful loads of sunbeds & daybeds two big pools one heated. On arrival we paid and then were shown the pools and our towels placed out which was great.    We really enjoyed our day but the service element was so poor. I had read this on the reviews and decided that maybe this is due to the Ramadan season and the staff may be slightly under pressure but I don't believe this to be so now.    To start with I was questioned quite rudely had I paid when I offered to show the receipt the guy in a brown suit he said it's okay I trust you! Clearly you hadn't? No one came to ask for drinks there was just no one around trying to get some bottles of water was difficult. Later that day a lady came and had a basket to put used towels in she tipped the ashtray into the basket ( I don't know why?) and it started smoking I noticed and say to her it was on fire and we gave her our bottled water to put it out! She left and the man in the suit came by I explained to him what happened and said he could replace my water if he liked but no one came! I paid ¬£2 for that small bottle of water!    This is just so sad as this hotel looks really beautiful inside and out. All other Sofitel hotels are normally brilliant. We also went to Le Jardins de Koutoubia which was 200 dirhams the hotel is older and smaller but beautiful and has 2 pools one on the roof and the service was exceptional they even came round with fresh cut fruit for guests which is what you would expect from the Sofitel great big sunbeds too!

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Alexia T wrote a review May 2017,20,"Beautiful grounds, TERRIBLE service",We stayed at the Sofitel Lounge & Spa for two nights while in Marrakech. One thing to note is that the Lounge & Spa is the same hotel as the Palais Imperial (just different towers). While the grounds were very nice the service was absolutely TERRIBLE. My husband and I had a horrible experience at the pool the second afternoon. We arrived around 2pm and after laying on our chairs for 45 minutes finally tracked down a waiter to get a food & drink menu. He came back 20 minutes later to take our order and we asked for a bottle of wine and scoop of ice cream. Another 45 minutes later he was nowhere to be found and we had not received our very simple order. I tracked down the pool manager and explained the situation and my frustration. He had another waiting come take care of us and he brought us an upgraded bottle of wine and some additional snacks which I assumed were on the hotel. As we were getting ready to leave we are hit with a bill charging us for a more expensive bottle of wine than we had originally ordered. At this point I was too annoyed to track down the manager again so just paid the bill and got out of there. The whole time we were there the service was awful but this specific instance was the worst. Long story short I would not suggest staying at the Sofitel. There are many other nice hotels around the area that I'm sure have much better service.,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/442alexiat

Upon arrival the staff were very helpful and pointed me in the right direction. Once we got to the pool lounge my opinion of the staff changed completely. Disinterested and bored they took our order forgetting it twice! Once the food came it was super bland and definitely not worth the money. Shisha was nothing special either and no one tended to it. We were super hungry so we are it anyway which in hindsight I probably shouldn't have done! Upon returning to our hotel I started feeling a little unwell only to experience full-blown violent sickness for a solid 15 hours after! Completely ruined my last night in Marrakech.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Kirtana K wrote a review May 2017,20,Beautiful hotel but less than stellar service from staff,"The hotel was very beautiful and the grounds were well-kept including the pool. However the service from the front desk and housekeeping staff was less than stellar. First we were assigned a room that was right next to an empty wing which at first seemed nice since we were so exhausted from our flight and train ride from Casablanca. However that feeling was short-lived because the next morning we heard power drill noises starting at 8 AM in the room next to ours. It was a bit frustrating since we were hoping to sleep in a little bit after our long day of travel. When we asked the front desk staff about switching rooms we were told that we could only upgrade to a more expensive room rather than a similar room to ours. They were very inflexible with our request and for the rest of our stay we were woken up to loud noises at 8 AM. Second our hotel room was situated right next to one of the indoor/outdoor restaurants which played loud music until 1 AM in the morning every night. We asked the front desk staff whether they could ask the restaurant staff to turn down the music and they responded that they would take care of our request. However after multiple phone calls the restaurant never lowered down the volume of the music which meant that the front desk staff never actually ""took care"" of our request. This was VERY disappointing since we couldn't get a full night's rest during our entire stay due to the loud music until 1 AM and loud construction noises starting at 8 AM. Third the housekeeping staff never bothered to refill our complimentary tea/coffee selections in the room despite repeated requests. Finally during check-out the front desk charged us for additional mini-bar items that we did not use during our stay. The front desk staff had a hard time believing us and made a huge deal about removing the additional charges despite our repeated statements that we were being honest about not using the additional mini-bar items. I would not recommend staying at this Sofitel in Marrakech since the front desk and housekeeping staff do not make any attempt to resolve issues raised by their guests or care about improving the quality of guests' stay.",Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Baltimore, Maryland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/949kirtanak
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Ed I wrote a review May 2017,20,Deeply Dissapointing,My wife and I arrived at this hotel with high hopes. We had saved for ages having promised ourselves a premium five star break following a difficult couple of years in our personal circumstances. We booked a five star establishment believing that they would uphold the traditions of quality and service that one expects from a premier hotel however in so many ways we were both deeply disappointed and shocked at how inconsequential our needs were to the management and staff at The Sofitel Hotel in Marrakesh.    Arrival was ok indeed we were sat down for a short while our credit card details were taken and our keys given to us. We were then escorted to our rooms with our bags. We had booked a suite and this was available. Before we were able (or allowed) to go to the room a very effusive concierge started to tell us about excursions however it was most unwelcome as we had been travelling all day but he would not relent until he was finished.    On arrival into the room we immediately noticed how dimly lit it was in fact it was actually quite difficult to see anything in the main bedroom but the loo and bathroom were satisfactory despite many of the light bulbs being blown.    That evening we went to the first of several restaurants and had a pleasant enough meal although this cost over 100 GBP and we only had soft drinks! So to bed and to be fair we had a good nights sleep until people above started moving furniture at 5.00 am which was a rude awakening. It should be noted that the hotel has poor sound proofing and you can hear the televisions and conversations in adjacent rooms. Take ear plugs! We went down to breakfast quite late and were shown to a filthy table. It looked as if they had hosted a kids party. Because we had the temerity to arrive shortly before they closed we were told in no uncertain terms to be quick not much fun when breakfast for two as an eye watering ¬£40 +. I felt humiliated and insulted.    We elected to book a trip with the concierge but the price was now quoted in euros and he would accept only a cash payment as he was clearly on some kind of commission but what really got me was that the price had suddenly gone up by about ¬£20 too. I paid without too much fuss believing that we all have to make a living but feeling slightly that the Sofitel had sanctioned a little stealing alongside their usual business.    That day we took lunch in the main restaurant which was about ¬£50 per head plus drinks. The food whilst ok did no warrant the price although the oysters were a nice touch. In this restaurant the service was reasonable and almost up to a five star standard but not quite.    Next day we took our trip but finding our host was quite difficult as the concierge who was so eager to take our cash was no where to be seen. We contracted very serious food poisoning on this trip so I would advise against eating lunch in the mountains particularly at the venue chosen by the driver. On the positive side our 200 euros bought us a well informed driver a decent car and some interesting if 'contrived for tourists' excursions. Sadly he food poisoning laid us up for 3 days afterwards.    Whilst we had food poisoning we used room service. Of course this is always expensive but the Sofitel really know how to to provide the least possible quality and service for the most amount of money. A burger and chips at over ¬£20 and a waiting time of over an hour and a half. On top of the cost they charge an extra ¬£12 tray charge making a burger over ¬£30.    The next day I begged for some attention from house keeping but it was only after 36 hours and a threat to vacate the room that anyone arrived. We had rotting flowers no water stinking towels no toilet paper an empty mini bar and no replacement coffee tea or milk. Frankly the house keeping service was laughable I would expect better attention in Wormwood Scrubs prison.    I am writing this just before we leave. Today finally someone turned up to clean the room. The rotting flowers have been removed and we have clean towels.    I should comment on reception too really. We were unable to use our phone so I had to make my way down to the lobby to report the fault which was a good five minute walk. The male receptionist was disinterested and ignorant. Firstly he just ignored me when I arrived preferring to complete counting money and doing paper work. When I informed him of the fault it took a little while for him to even recognise what I was going on about the conversation went like this-    Me- 'Hello I need to report a fault on my telephone I cannot contact room service.  Receptionist- 'you dial 24'  Me- ' Yes I have tried that but it doesn't connect  Receptionist- 'Its dial 24'  Me- I am sorry you don‚Äôt understand I can't get any kind of line  Receptionist- 'You try 9?'  Me- (now a little peeved) Yes I try everything- nothing works also there are no instructions either.  Receptionist- 'This in your room?'  me- (Lost patience now)- 'No in next doors room'  Receptionist- No words just blank look  Me- 'Please I am not an idiot- of course it's in my room and yes its actually not working  receptionist - (now deeply offended) 'I not call you idiot sir'  me- 'No but you are treating me like one now kindly send someone up....' turns on heals exit stage left in dramatic huff‚Ä¶..    This episode was pretty indicative of the typical two star service at what purports to be a five star hotel.    The week got little better. We felt generally ignored poorly serviced and highly ripped off.    This hotel has a serous management problem. Clearly morale is low amongst staff and there is no consistent or quality training at all.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,jhackTravels wrote a review May 2017,50,High End Hotel Right in the Middle of Marrakech,This hotel true to the Sofitel brand was an outstanding stay and very relaxing. The hotel is a bit big so if you have trouble walking ask to get a room closer to the reception area. Check in was fast and they prepared tea for me while I waited.    Rooms are clean and spacious with nice Moroccan decor. Food was delicious too!    Id recommend staying here as its very central to everything and easy to get around. Only issue is the night club attached to the hotel as it can get quite busy at night but the noise shouldn't bother you.,Date of stay: January 2017,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jhackTravels

We asked to get a day pass for the pool and this woman named Aziza helped us. She never smiled once only when we asked if drinks were included in the price. She actually laughed in our face. She made up a price for us when we said we wanted to include lunch. Without lunch but was 500 and with lunch 700 per person. I guess she decides and if she likes you the price goes down. She never explained where to go where and what time lunch would be served etc etc. The pools were ok lunch buffet amazing but nevertheless that didn't make up for the rudeness of this woman.

The communal areas were beautiful as you would expect from  Sofitel. The rooms were a little tired but perfectly good. The outdoor areas were lovely with lots of shaded lounge areas to get out of the searing heat. The price of drinks and food are quite high but again this is a high end hotel group so to be expected and there are plenty of other options for food and drink nearby just a short cab ride away.

The pool area was very stylish in the evening we found the so lounge which I found to be fantastic with a live band a dj and 2 bars there were also other lounges and one outside with great lighting and views were u could eat and drink.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,tedwiges wrote a review Apr 2017,40,Swimming pool break at Sofitel,On April 12th we spent the whole day at Sofitel Marrakech to enjoying sun swimming pool and lunch at the pool.    From the Medina it takes less than 5 minutes to reach the hotel.    The price is around 30 ‚Ç¨/person just to access the swimming pool anytime you want.    All around the 2 swimming pools you can find very large and very comfortable sofa. The hotel provides towels included in the entrance fee.    It is quite busy so do not expect to get a quiet area. Nevertheless sofa together with sun and high temperature invites you to sleep. Deeply...    One swimming pool is heated: it is where you will find all the kids (around 20). The other one colder is quiet.    When it is time for lunch in addition to your 30 ‚Ç¨ entrance fee you just move from your sofa to the terrace where you can enjoy pizzas hamburger salads club sandwiches... You need to consider a minimum budget of 30/40 ‚Ç¨ per person. The food is really nice.    Based on our expenses our swimming pool break at Sofitel Marrakech cost around 60 ‚Ç¨/person. It was really relaxing even if is noisy crowded.

Sometimes The group I came with will just decide not to order drinks/food just to avoid trying to get attention from the waiter.. if they had more waiters they would sell sooo much more..and please put towels where people can fetch them if you won't habe enough staff to provide them.

We initially booked to stay at the sofitel spa and lounge.. however due to some very loud banging we asked to change rooms which was done after a few complaints.. we were moved to the old side and given a room.. we were not happy with this and spoke to nafisa who sorted this for us and the day after we swapped rooms. Nafisa was very friendly and listened to our complaints and handled well.. as a sorry for the troubles we had lovely candles set out with a warm running bath and petals.    The rooms at the sofitel spa side were very spacious beautiful french vintage modern look.. the bathrooms are slightly dated all amenities are provided..    No iron was provided the first time we asked for it an hour later still no iron was delivered so we called again and one was delivered while we went out for dinner.    One day we had a wake up call at 7am even though we had not requested one.    Pool side    Absolutely beautiful large loungers 2 pools plus jacuzzi the service for pool side food and beverages were good. We were greeted most days by mohsin who seemed to be very busy however always friendly and at your service.. However the service for the pool attendants really needs looking at. There appeared to be 2 pool attendants who were so busy. We had to go and get the towels ourself after waiting approx 15 minutes to grab his attention. The poolside was extremely busy not a spare seat spare most days.    Location    Great location extremely friendly place really nice cafes around    Check out/ departure    We requested a late check out however our room was booked we therefore were advised that we can stay poolside and they would provide us with a courtesy room to shower and change. We requested the room 2 hours before our departure and were advised that room service were cleaning it. Approx 15 minutes later we were provided the key we walked into the room which had a really horrible smell the window was opened but the smell remained.. the shower had not been cleaned from the last user there were towels everywhere and shower gel and shampoo (used bottles) in the bathroom. Not a good end to the trip.  However the bell boy/porter who helped us with our luggage and to locate a taxi was very pleasant and friendly.    Overall    Satisfied with the trip it was our first time in Marrakech and we were here for our 2 year anniversary. Even though i have highlighted some negative points it was a lovely trip beautiful hotel perfect weather.. once they iron out a few service issues this will be true to the Sofitel brand!

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,janddp29 wrote a review Mar 2017,30,Confusion at the start but eventually fine,First of all - Sofitel advertises that they have two hotels in Marrakesh and you can book rooms at both of these hotels. However the reality is that they have merged two adjacent properties and now have ONE reception areawith rooms in different wings of what is now the main building. But this is not the confusion i refer to in my heading!! We arrived at 2.00 pm and were offered a seat and a drink. Lovely - we thought. But we did not expect the next thing which was the Concierge coming over to us and giving us a hard sell on all the things he could organise for us - all before we had even checked in. We felt 'sold to' and under pressure and were somewhat annoyed. Things didn't get any better when we eventually pushed past him and fronted up to the Reception desk -there are far too many people working at the desks and they are all getting in each other's way. We eventually caught someone's eye (really) and were given an upgrade - great! Looked at the room on the same level as the open air terrace restaurant with direct access via an open staircase from our balcony to the restaurant - not great. Refused this room and insisted on another on a higher floor where we would feel safer. To cut a long story short - it took us three hours of persistence to get checked in and get a room. This is not the sofitel service we have come to love and they also recognised that our start had not been good by leaving us a small gift and a written apology in our room later that evening. However after this rocky start things did improve. Our room was very usable good lighting and a great view. There is the old French arrangement of a separate toilet - somewhat outdated now and the bathroom could do with a total overhaul. The shower is particularly weak. We ate breakfast each morning - a great fresh selection of Moroccan and international food. And the coffee was great. One dinner in the 'international' restaurant - great steak and good service. The hotel is well located just outside the Medina. The front door staff are very good at getting cabs off the street - although they do try to push you towards the hotel limo -which will cost three times as much. This is a very busy hotel there were always loads of suitcases lining the entrance hall reception needs a serious rethink and sofitel need to sort out their website - but apart from all this it is a lovely place to stay.,Date of stay: March 2017,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janddp29

When we finally got to the hotel in the evening we were given a room with a view of the restaurant which we were not happy about as last time we visited we were given a room with the most beautiful view which drew as back to this hotel! As I explained this to the receptionist she gave us another room which she claimed had the pool view when we moved to this room it was exactly as the one we were first given just a floor beneath but in fact worse as our balcony had stairs leading to the restaurant which has no privacy whatsoever! Everyone can see through the room so we need to have our curtains closed at all times which defeats the purpose of what I had asked for! (The view)    When I called to complain again we were told that we had to wait until the next day to be given another room! This made us feel quite unsettled on our first night of the holiday.    We Would have never faulted this hotel the last time We visited hence why we came to visit again and neither am I faulting it this time but the service we were given yesterday doesn't come as near enough as close as the 5* service we were given last year.

But a great location and well maintained hotel so apart from my minor comments a nice place in walking distance of most places to visit in Marrakech,Date of stay: December 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Rixheim, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zak-367

Two members of staff stand out as going above and beyond and I am ashamed that I am only able to mention by name one of those staff. Mohammed and his colleague (so so sorry that I can't recall his name as it was not a name I have heard before - many apologies). Anyway they were both amazing and were so attentive to our needs. I cannot wait to visit again on 15th February when I know they will be there and determined to make my next visit as memorable as the last one.

It is absolutely elegant and delightful Try a Manhattan at the Lawerence Lounge!    However we were given room 349 which was comfortable but very tired. The carpet and chairs were stained the desk top had a gouge and the bathroom tub had a loose fixture. This room was not in keeping with this caliber hotel. My wife complained to customer relations they explained renovations were on-going but had't been done yet in 349. We were upgraded and moved to a delightful suite with a balcony overlooking the snow capped Atlas mountains in the distance.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Chotisiasha wrote a review Jan 2017,30,"good property, average service",Overall the hotel was ok. There were some really good things about the hotel but some which made it disappointing and hence the three star rating.  We stayed 3 nights at the hotel. I had requested for a room facing the pool as wanted some quiet. The room we got was at the end of the corridor and next the the room they were constructing further rooms/ fixing walls etc. So there was a lot of noise whole day. We had spent some time in the room but were mainly out so it was bearable but it is not expected from a big hotel like this. The construction workers were always around the room. Further as it was end of corrider it didnt really have a view as i was hoping.    Further the bathroom had a leakage in terms of the bathtub glass shower curtain was not fit in properly so everytime you would shower the whole bathroom would be wet as the alignment of the shower curtain was not proper.    The service from the hotel staff was decent they have a nice property and proximity to some of the restaurants etc is good. We had a meal near the swimming pool and food was decent being a vegetarian. Lots of activities for kids so good place to spend a few days if you want to have a resort break.    One more thing that I was upset about was i had forgotten my scarf in the restaurant on the day of checkout and I realised it within 15 min and called them but they could not track it. It was hard to explain to them as few people understood english esp on phone and there was a point wherein I was just speaking to staff all over the place but no one was understanding. Unfortunately I didnt find it which was disappointing as I was very sure of the exact spot I forgot it and being 7:30 in the morning I didnt think there were lots of people either at the breakfast restaurant. Anyways that was my bad luck but hoped for better service.,Date of stay: December 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chotisiasha

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Lauren K wrote a review Nov 2016,40,Beautiful luxury hotel,This is a beautiful luxury hotel. I'm giving it a 4 out of 5 more for the location than the hotel as it is in a part of Marrakech that quite honestly reminded me of Las Vegas or Beverly Hills more than anything else and there isn't much to do within walking distance. A taxi or car is required to get almost anywhere. With that said the hotel is stunning and the staff was lovely. It's also very well staffed with people to greet you at the entrance to open doors get taxis help with bags etc... I found that they were able to anticipate our next move or step into assist before we even asked without being overbearing. The concierge was also very helpful. He assisted me in making a reservation at a hamman and making a dinner reservation for a large party.  There's a lot of restaurant/bar/patio spaces to sit and get a drink or something to eat although the prices are relatively high and comparable to what we'd spend in the US on food or drink. The breakfast is fantastic. It's a large buffet and everything was really good- from the made to order omelettes crepes/waffles charcuterie fruit and yogurt pastries etc...  The rooms themselves are very nice and the beds super comfortable. We had a small private outdoor space which was pleasant and despite the hotel being quite busy it was generally very quiet and peaceful.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,GlobalSnowHound wrote a review Oct 2016,10,Worse place I've stayed in years.,The only redeemable aspect of this hotel is the location and the doormen.    The spa is overpriced and services are not very good. The hotel wants to charge you for every service. For example if you want to use the spa pool you have to pay.    The room was not well maintained with stained carpets non-functioning lights and many items broken or scratched.    Do not stay here if you are looking to relax as there is a horrible wedding reception style band that cranks out the hits well past midnight every night.

Beautiful hotel reception and views onto a lovely pool area. We are a party of four women celebrating my sister's 40th birthday. The Lounge and Spa section of the hotel should be closed as the noise from the building works is awful. I moved rooms yesterday due to the loud drilling noise and overnight my sister' room had a group of rowdy men trying to get through the interconnecting door that wouldn't lock properly. They were moved to the only room available that is down a corridor that has no lighting so you can't even see to open your door. They were woken by all the drilling and building works.  You can also hear the building work noise from the swimming pool area. Loads of pool side staff stood around but not interested in taking your drinks order. Had to walk over to the bar twice before we were able to order a drink.  So far the only positive has been the excellent breakfast.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Devika P wrote a review Oct 2016,40,Lovely stay but some easy improvements to be made..,Overall we had a lovely 5 night stay at the Sofitel lounge and spa. The swimming pools lobby lounge areas etc. were clean and inviting and in line with what we have come to expect of the Sofitel chain. The rooms are in need of a refurb particularly the carpets which were stained. Service was generally good. There are a few things that could be improved which would have made our stay much better:    1. Taxis. There are a line of taxis just outside the hotel gates. The hotel have agreed a fixed rate of 50 diharams each way up to a fixed distance so they do not run on the meter. This is more expensive than metered taxis (which you can hail down on the street) but you pay extra as these taxis are always there and they regularly service the hotel. They can also pick you up for the return journey (again they charge 50 diharams). A taxi from the hotel to the airport should be 70 diharams during the day and 100 diharams at night. None of this was explained to us by the hotel staff which caused a lot of unnecessary confusion.    2. Shower. Our room shower water changed from burning hot to freezing cold regularly. We complained about this daily but nothing was done. I appreciate these things are not easy to fix particularly as the rooms are a bit dated but we would have appreciated some acknowledgement of our complaint from the hotel manager which we never received.    3. Spa discount. Our room rate had a % discount on the spa treatments. Whilst we were pleasantly surprised that our treatment cost less than we expected when we came to pay we were not told of this when we checked in (also not on our booking confirmation). If we had known we may have booked more treatments.    4. Check out. Whilst check in was a very relaxed and pleasant process check out was not as pleasant. The person serving us was quite rude and left us feeling low at the end of our holiday. This is an area that could be improved.,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VancouverDee

The swimming pool area is amazing you can enjoy a full day there and since it's more as a garden then only a pool that made it more relaxing.    Everyone starting from the management reception and waitress was helpful and very friendly.    The main points we didn't like was the continues sound of the work going on starting early in the morning and in the 3rd floor there is this big wooden hanger which is used only for hanging two Chandeliers those two hanger made the walk way ugly and unsafe.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,UpUpAndAwayx wrote a review Oct 2016,40,"Lovely for a short break, could do with a refurb!",I have stayed at a Sofitel in Bali so was expecting a similar standard. All communal areas of this hotel are immaculate and smell great the grounds are kept to a high standard and the pool area was fantastic in fact their loungers or should I say day beds were the best I'd ever seen around a pool and perfect for private bathing and chilling out.    The rooms however let this hotel down and could do with a refurb. Our carpets were stained the plug socket at the dressing table was hanging off the wall and didn't work and the toilet door didn't close all the way. The patio door also didn't have a lock we were on the 3rd floor so not majorly bothered but if you have a small child you wouldn't want a door that doesn't have a lock! On the plus side the bed was very comfortable the sheets were changed daily the shower had a decent pressure and they provide robes slippers and offered a turndown service daily.    The staff were all very friendly a little less so in the So Lounge but we only went there once so it didn't bother us. They struggled to understand us at times due to the language barrier but again that was nothing major.    The pool was a great chill out area and the day beds are a great idea. The actual pool was very clean and inviting a little cold but refreshing once you swam around. The staff will serve you while you sunbath but the service at times was slow. It;s a shame they allow the 3rd pool (up on the 1st floor) to go to waste we were told it would be 400MAD per person to sit around that pool we didn't see a single person in there the whole 4 days we stayed.    Breakfast was a little limited but if you're only there for a short time you'll survive. The chef's are very friendly and helpful. They do have a bit of a bird problem though sometimes there were bird droppings on the table so opt to eat inside if this would put you off.    I guess I would return again but those rooms could definitely do with some new carpets and having the fixtures and fittings replaced/upgraded.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Maidenhead, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UpUpAndAwayx

The staff is very friendly and accommodating as expected at any Sofitel hotel.    The lobby and pool area are both very pleasant. However I found the rooms while comfortable to still be a bit disappointing. It is clear that the bedrooms needed renovation as the furniture and the bathrooms do come across as a little outdated. The little separate room for the toilet was also quite old-feeling and not very well ventilated. On the plus side the bed was comfortable we had a nice view of the pool area and the room was very quiet and nice to sleep in.    The iconic Sofitel weekend breakfasts are fantastic. So many choices that you end up overeating but it's still a great experience. However I found the poolside restaurant to be a bit boring. It would be nice to see a more varied menu.    The spa has a nice heated indoor pool as well as a large fitness center. The reception area of the spa is beautiful with a Moroccan fountain in the center.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Travel Matti wrote a review Sep 2016,40,Great hotel in a intriguing city,"We chose this hotel for our anniversary trip to Marrakesh and we were not disappointed.  We ordered the airport transfer through the hotel and were welcomed with a hotel sign at the airport and chaufeured with a Mercedes back to the hotel. Whilst the hotel transfer option costs about 3 times what it would cost with one of the local taxi guys the level of comfort is simply unsurpassed.    We were welcomed into hotel by many helping hands however despite having completed the online checkin the day before it seemed that this did not add any value as our room keys were not simply ready as expected and we rather had to wait for the local team to complete the check-in again.    With the Loung and Spa being the renovated wing of the Sofitel in Marrakesh we were escorted to a wonderfully fitted room on the fourth floor facing the pool and if you travel in winter / spring when their is better visibility you would be able to get a great view of the High Atlas mountains as well.    The hotel surprised on the evening of the arrival when staff arrived at 22:40 to complete the complimentary ""anniversary room decoration"" which included a delicious cake. Apart from the unexpected timing the guesture was fantastic.    In the evening we were further surprised to find out that at the back of the hotel wing in which we stayed the hotels own Lounge was one of the cities more popular Lounge locations with the adjoining night cllub. Whilst the open walkways on this side of the building had glass doors fitted retrospectively to reduce the noise impact of the Lounge they did not prevent the bass travelling into the building structure. Despite initially being concerned about it we noticed that it was only mildly noticable in the room but if you expect full silence in your room you should rater request to be located in other hotel room wings.    The swimming pool area is huge and the hotel goes to great extend to organise events from pool parties with style and other things which was nice. The hotels food options vary. Whilst breakfast and the pool food options are as to be expected the hotels own restaurant food is way to ""touristy"" and lacking flavour. We found many better dining options throughout nearby Medina.    Overall we had a great couples get away and really enjoyed our stay as I wrote above some of the noticed items are simply down to personal preference and expectation.",Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Perth, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelMatti

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,pittman64 wrote a review Jul 2016,50,A nice weekend getaway hotel,This hotel is great for multiple reasons. First of all the location is ideal. You're able to quickly and easily walk into the Medina while stopping along the way at multiple locations for photos or a drink. You can also pick up taxi's easily from the hotel as they sit on the main street; their prices are competitive and you can haggle for a deal. Secondly the hotel itself is nice. It's very spacious in the lobby with a great pool/lounge area. It seems to fit multiple ideas of what a great vacation is; you can either come here by yourself with a spouse or even make it a family trip. The hotel's public areas seem to offer a great time for all types of trips. Lastly the rooms are great. We had a very spacious bed excellent patio on the first floor to sit out and relax while also enjoying the nice sized bathroom. Additional amenities in the hotel were great to include the food (room service and breakfast); the spa was nice albeit overpriced compared to other areas but you're in a large chain hotel that is high-end so it's expected; and lastly the ability to sit somewhere whether it be the lobby pool side area or in a chair throughout the endless hallways and just relax/read a book. Parking is available albeit limited. Call ahead for this type of request. We will be back to this hotel for sure.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pittman64

To me they offered a free access to internal Spa/swimming area but I recommend this to be a standard for Platinum members.    I should highlight one special member of staff - Zeyneb. She was excellent.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Nikki J wrote a review Jun 2016,50,Seven days at Sofitel Marrakesh,Sunday to Sunday at the Sofitel Marrakesh far exceeded our expectations. We arrived tired and slightly stressed after a strangely confrontational taxi transfer from the airport (Which should cost you 100 dirhams- i think a fixed rate to the region that Sofitel is located)    The moment we pulled up the bell boy opened the taxi door and we felt like we'd arrived at a 5 star hotel...finally. The security staff at the entrance to the hotel were so kind and gracious. We were led up into reception where Ibtissama the receptionist greeted us by seating us in the lobby which had one of those 'corporate' scents being pumped in..non offensive in fact a very calming and pleasing scent. She called for us to be handed some refresher towels and 2 Moroccan teas along with some Moroccan sweets Ok so no big deal you may say but the way Ibtissama seated us and took us through the the check in process was stellar and really showed how a check in is supposed to be done. She came over and listened to our gripes about the delayed flight we had and the journey from the airport (15mins) we literally felt like our holiday had began the moment she started to speak. She gave us tips on how to handle ourselves in town and gave us all the info we needed. I privately mentioned it was my girlfriends birthday and she and the room service team decorated the room and prepared a cake i cannot thank them enough. Atoul Singhat Brahim Sanae Balkani made the day so special. Especially Ibtissama the receptionist she made what was already going to be a lovely stay more than perfect. Because of her we would definitely return and recommend.    We visited in the month of Ramadan maybe avoid that as some of the local shops and restaurants were closed during the day.    Hotel pool facilities were great location was great breakfast was really good from crepes to omelettes to fresh patisserie! Breakfast staff got to know what we wanted and had our teas and coffees and freshly squeezed orange juice ready each morning. The hotel restaurants are pricey and food in Marrakesh is all quite similar. I would say to venture out if you can tear yourselves away at least in the evenings.    Weather was amazing although got a little chilly in the evenings. Cabs were between 30-50 dirhams each way to the main square from the hotel negotiate this prior to getting in.    Sofitel looks pretty amazing really impressive you have to look really closely to find faults. I'm quite fussy and i was happy. Porches and Range Rovers parked up outside very posh.    Its not a brand new hotel and there are bits that could do with an update but the experience we had due to the staff more than made up for this.    I wish more of them spoke English but thats not a complaint just an observation. We brits need to be multi lingual. Everybody all over the world seems to be. Most staff speak a little English if not fluent but practically speak French.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Christopher M wrote a review May 2016,40,Mixed experience in the back-to-back twin Sofitel Marrakech hotels,"The first night at Sofitel Lounge & Spa (SLS) was in a suite said to have Atlas mountain view. This is nonsense as the mountains are 20-plus miles away and visiblility in Morocco is rarely 20 miles. The SLS suites are also quite old with a 1990s shower over the bath and on the end of a wing with two balconies per suite are adversely affected by road noise. Very quiet a/c and comfotable bed. Massive breakfast spread served inside or out. Dinner at So Good restaurant was OK but we had to be outside in the wind (with heater) as the inner space only provided microscopic tables in a night club setting.  We then spent two fabulous nights in a ""tent"" at Kasbah Tamadot.  Our return to SLS for two nights apparently clashed with an African Convention which took over most of the SLS end. We were therefore 'upgraded' to the Sofitel Imperial Palais (SIP) along the building but wished we had not been!!  SIP looks to be an all suite hotel with nice recently renovated rooms over looking the pools and set back from the main road with little road noise. The suite was huge with one WC a bath with shower over but also a proper separate shower. A spacious lounge with 4-seater dining table and so many wardrobes/cupboards we had to remember what was where. Two nice balconies one with a love-seat style daybed and resident pair of pigeons. All well and good but in SIP room 409 neither the a/c unit in the lounge nor the one in the bedroom/bath complex provided any useful cooling during a minor May Marrakech heatwave. Truly awful experience with barely any sleep for either of us. We were booked on a late flight out so happily avoided a second intolerable night in SIP.  L'Oranderie restaurant is billed as the gourmet sofitel Restaurant but we found it unsatisfactory. Eating outside we were subject to cigarette and cigar smoke from other diners and a very badly behaved endlessly screaming child that the staff did nothing to control at 9.30pm. There was no exterior non-smoking zone and should not admit small children late a night. The bulk of the outside tables are in a open air pavilion and subject to intrusive high volume muzak that the staff refused to soften.  An early repeat breakfast in the same breakfast room as before was very disappointing with half the previous staff missing and half the previous food offerings missing at 0730.  In all a very mixed and inconsistent experience in the twin Yin and Yang of SLS & SIP but very well located. Walking distance to the Medina and 10 minutes by taxi from the Airport but no aircraft noise.  Would stay elsewhere next time rather than play room and restaurant roulette.  The SIP suite came with a ""token"" Butler who was big on introductng herself but then vanished without trace.

When I was checking out my rental car had a flat tire. The valet manager offered to fix it so we gave him money. He asked for more so we gave it to him thinking that was tip. When we came back few hours later the valet manager was nowhere. This time the valet asked for another tip. The bellman who initially brought my bags out refused to load my bags into the car (since he already got his tip) and sent another bellman who now asked for another tip. I don't mind tipping for good service but this situation was out of control. Now that I'm back in US I see that my Sofitel account is not credited with my stay. I've emailed 3 times for the bill so I can forward to the point program. No response. This is a totally routine request Marriott Courtyards respond in an hour.

Yes the hotel is clean the service is ok (although we had an unpleasent experience at the main reception- when asked for a previosuly offered a lowered price for the breakfast we were told that they didn't have a note of that?! We found that extremely rude as they simply meant we were lying (!)  The other thing is we wanted to lie down next to the infinity pool which we couldn't understand why was completely empty so we sat down on the chairs next to it.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,DivaFabulous wrote a review May 2016,40,Stunning interior!,The hotel is absolutely stunning in its playfully modern style. The Palais Imperial entrance is grand and opulent whereas the lounge and spa had a more modern minimalistic feel to it. The pool area is huge with ample space and lounging options and the spa is gorgeous. If you find yourself having dinner at l'orangerie try the tenderloin it's cooked to perfection.    Some things could be improved though:  1) the 400 MAD charge(yes even for guests) to use the infinity pool on the terrace is a bit unnecessary and high given that it's higher than the admission to most beach clubs where you also get more for your fee than one little infinity pool  2) some minor details are a bit annoying as they disrupt the ambience of the otherwise beautiful lounging ares for example - the chandeliers in the section with the umbrellas in the lounge & spa area are for some reason hung from 2 massive steel beams which have been placed across the balustrade of the third floor and taped with yellow/black striped warning duct tape. oOf course parts of the beams are sticking out onto the corridors leading to the rooms meaning that the residents of those rooms have to watch out for the beams en route to/from their rooms. Other (not less heavy) chandeliers and umbrellas are hung from thin barely visible wires why not these?  3) Our first room on the third floor overlooking the beautiful majorelle style fountain & pond was beautiful during the day but made it impossible to sleep at night due to what seemed to be hundreds of croaking frogs that sounded just as if they were right in our room. We gave them a chance for 2 nights (the reception staff did send security to get rid of them on the second night but failed as it was pitch black and they are.. frogs ie quite hard to locate and move can't blame them there) and asked to be moved on the third night which the staff arranged swiftly and efficiently requiring minimum effort on our behalf.    Having said that I'm very pleased with my stay and very grateful to the staff who went out of their way to accomodate all our requests in a professional and hospitable manner. Thank you so much for my birthday cake and the vip treatment guys :)  A special thanks to Aida Wafaa and Ayoub at the reception Mohcine and Mokhtar by the pool and of course Reda at the concierge desk for their dedication and professionalism.,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Malm√∂, Sweden",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DivaFabulous
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Carol F wrote a review Apr 2016,50,Pampered and well fed,The Sofitel is a wonderful combination of traditional and modern. The service was terrific (with the exception of a somewhat Byzantine check-in). The room was large and bright.    At first we thought the breakfast was too pricey. However there was no where else to get breakfast that we could find so we decided to have it at the hotel. It was amazing. A sumptuous buffet good coffee and the most beautiful patio and poolside setting. It was so hard to pull ourselves away.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,968val wrote a review Apr 2016,40,Easter in Marrakesh,This hotel is really fantastic the rooms although not to everyone's taste were maybe a little dated but the beds were to die for the best sleep so comfortable we didn't want to get up and they do bring free water each day. The outside area is super again you cannot fault the sunbeds or the staff who walk you to your beds and lay out your towels. The staff are so polite and always open doors for you the spa was rather expensive but we found a Yves Roche sop which did massages very cheaply. The hotel is very well located and it is so easy to get around on foot you can easily walk to the souls a and to the new town where they have opened a new shopping centre. Food is very reasonable around the hotel but we didn't actually eat in the Sofitel.

We stayed here for 3 nights and we didn't want to leave. It feels like at home even thought that hotel is quite big but you do not feel that. The reception stuff is very helpful and friendly. The stuff by swimming pool is very efficient they always finds you the best ""spot"" to relax brings the towels in few seconds. The room we stayed was simple amazing (the suite) overlooking the Atlas mountains and the pool. Room service is very great. Special thanks to Mimouni from room service (i hope I remember his name correctly) He was serving us Sunday nigh: very friendly super professional has answer to all your questions very good adviser in the wine selections!!! The breakfast is just amazing: sooo big variety and the choice. Everything is served fresh and tasty. At breakfast there is lady Fatima who make an amazing Marcian pancakes with very warm and nice smile she always puts in your plate the hot pancake from the pan :) The terrace of breakfast area is fabulous!!!  This hotel has an amazing restaurent L'orangeria! Highly recommended to try.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,BelFlo2015 wrote a review Apr 2016,10,Dreadful service,"I travelled to Marrakech with my daughter for a long weekend. I have to say that there wasn't one day when something went wrong due to bad service. Day one: on arrival we were met my rude reception staff. It took at least 30 mins to check in and get a room key (even though there was hardly any other people checking in at that time). We were given a room worth a double bed having already paid for a twin room. We tried to call the reception from the room but the phone just rang and rang. We therefore had to go back downstairs wait again for the rude reception staff and finally get a key to a room with twin beds. Day two: our room phones didn't work so couldn't order room service. We asked for them to mend the phones and they didn't. We arrive back from an early dinner and my daughter wanted some ice cream and they said they had run out! We also realised on our return that our twin beds had been made into a double bed whilst we were out! We had to wait until 11.30pm for someone to change the bed back. Day three: still didn't mend our phones despite asking twice again. Again no ice cream (although in the hotel brochure they prided themselves on their ""butler"" service where they can arrange ""anything for you discreetly"" to ensure your stay is amazing etc). They finally mended the phones and we ordered room service for dinner to be bought to our room. They failed to collect the empty table with left over food and we had to call them three times to collect the table before we could go to sleep. Day four: started off with having to find one of the ladies that clean the room to get more Rolet roll shower gel and cotton wall before we left the room . Lunch around the pool - my daughters chicken kebab was raw and they refused to take it off the bill initially (had to speak to two different managers before they agreed to remove it from the bill). Day five: ran out of sun tan cream and they refused to open the in hotel shop. Suggested I walk to the supermarket 10 minutes away to buy some.    Please don't stay here. It really is absolutely dreadful. Not worth the money. The service around the pool is slow the rooms need an overhaul and the drinks and food are ridiculously expensive.",Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BelFlo2015

INCREDIBLE ATTITUDE not even an excuse! We went out for dinner and when we arrive at 11 pm the room lights didn't work soooo after 15 minutes in the room phone and nobody answer I decided to go down to reception and found that it was time of changing the turn and they were just chatting between each other and doesn't take care of the phone less for the guests! As I claimed the guy that was lwaving just took his note book and left and told me that he was not working anymore!!! And Mohammed that was now in charge just told me ""calm down I have just arrived and it's not my problem"" VERY GOOD ANSWER FOR A SUPPOSED FIVE STAR HOTEL"". After arguing they sent me a maintenance worker to my room number 340 that he just told me what I knew: thenlights are not working I will try to fix them! After 30 minutes this is 12 am he hasn't come back again maybe with this kind of service tomorrow I'll be lucky and receive that is supossed I paid for: GOOD ATENTION!!

There are 2 parts: The Sofitel Lounge & Spa (more modern) and The Sofitel Imp√©rial (with Moroccan decoration). Both are confortable not ""waouh"" but ok.  The So beds are very bery confortable as in all Sofitels the wifi works perfectly and the breakfast is really nice and with a huge choice of fruits breads eggs etc.  The best part is obviously the garden and the heated pool (on the Imp√©rial side). The other pool is not heated! Around them you'll find confortable sunbeds and hamacs perfect to relax.  The hammam + Moroccan scrub (500 Dhs/30min) is nicely done but for a better more charming and cheaper treatment the Sultana (in the Medina) is a better option if you have time.",Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled on business,Gen√®ve,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smilysg

Check in was fast and efficient looking around the hotel it was stunning pristine and the citrus oil smell in the air as you walked through was so uplifting.    Are room was large decor was lovely had a nice size balcony we  quickly freshened up and went down to the So Lounge for dinner and shisha perfect place to chill and relax on a evening.    Breakfast was a slight disappointment which was included in  our stay but for people paying daily it is quite pricey for what you get so many pastries deserts freshly made crepes which i love but the cooked breakfast area was a let down only serving fresh eggs nothing to accompany with it no bacon (or halal version) tomatoes  mushrooms hash browns beans the  little things you miss eating while away other that that the staff  were efficient and you were never left waiting to be seated.    Pools were large plenty of day beds to sunbathe was quiet in  the week but as the weekend approached got very busy around  the heated pool area as the other larger pools were cold.  Service was slow most of the time and asking for something brought to you took several requests and telling different pool  staff which got annoying.    Checked out the So Spa very beautiful the facilities were good has gorgeous pool good steam hamman room and sauna never had any treatments there so cant comment i struggled to find the time but can imagine they would have been first class.    The hotel is very well situated in the Hivernage District you  have the casino round the corner the Menara Mall nearby  great restaurants & nightlife close to the Koutoubia Mosque Souks and Medina.

However for such a pricey hotel the overall ‚Äúsoftware‚Äù was rather disappointing due to inconsistencies in service levels and attention to details. My so-called quiet privilege suite (273) was overlooking the workers quarters and face directly the roadside. The suite looks old and jaded. After a flurry of activities I was transferred to a better junior suite (427) which was a lot more comfortable albeit a smaller one. The standard of housekeeping needs improvement. There were many signs in both rooms that the rooms had not been properly cleaned. For example in both rooms used coffee capsules were still stuck in the coffee machines. Perhaps they didn‚Äôt know how? At times there was only one service staff at the front desk for a long stretch of time. A phone call to reception asking for help was abruptly interrupted without any ‚Äúun instant svp"".  However the staff were generally very friendly. I felt that the standard of service during my stay was not because of lack of trying. It was obvious to me that they seemed to be doing so much of fire-fighting to get things done. One staff Monsieur Ouessman stood above the rest in trying to make things work for me - but there was so much a person can do if the system was not in place.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,YosselChina wrote a review Jan 2016,20,Be aware of poor service and an arrogant attitude plus out of date. Not 5 star.,Sofitel need to abandon this property if it wishes to maintain any thought of running reasonable hotels. The property built in 202 is so out of date it is beyond a joke. we had 2 rooms on the 3rd floor. Views were not good as they over looked the street. The balcony was ok but as with the rest of the room about 10 to 15% too small. The lighting in the room is terrible. Probably one of the worst we have experienced. Who ever designed these rooms should be shot!  Furniture in the room is appalling. The quality and design is horrible. All needs to be thrown out and replaced with a better quality and design. All the cushions on the furniture in the room and balcony needs replacing as they have stains all over. A lot of space wasted. No coffee or tea making facilities and this is supposed to be 5 star. What rubbish. Lack of sockets. There is just 1 in front of the desk and 1 by the side of the bed. This of course is too few. Why are they not International sockets instead of European only. Any decent hotel would use such sockets. Not up to date at all.  Bathroom is also too small and only a shower within the bath. This is so dangerous and only should be in a 2 star hotel if at all. The plumbing has some issues as the water goes from scalding to cold and back again. This shows an issue with the construction. The bathroom is dirty with damaged fittings which could easily be replaced if the managers here cared at all.  The breakfast at MAD 250 (Euro 23) is to be avoided as it is rubbish.  As others have commented the staff are arrogant and totally inefficient - Colonial influence? who knows but this place is over staffed and reflects on a very weak management who cannot train them.  The hotel doesn't really know what it wants to be very strange layout in lobby which makes no sense and there is no main focal point as there are 2 reception desks.  Even in the lobby I have seen more than 12/14 staff just walking around doing nothing over staffed with poor training.  Potentially this could be an enjoyable hotel but with lack of service and low quality of fittings and equipment 3 stars is what it should be. Management have said that renovation will happen in 2016.

The staff at the reception were showing a lot of attitude. The bell boys asked us to take our own luggage. However the person who took the cake was the guy staffing the concierge. He only seemed interested in selling certain restaurants and organising a day tour out of which he could earn commission. His writing was completely illegible and he had attitude which never seemed to end. The guy was extremely rude. The manager gave us an excuse that they are running quite busy. They certainly did not charge less. What a terrible excuse! That too coming from the manager of the hotel. Carpets in the corridors were stinky and shabby. Bathrooms date back to generations and one has to step into the tub to take a shower!

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,txchic wrote a review Dec 2015,40,"Beautiful hotel, but thin walls",With a spacious lobby and special group reception area the Sofitel looks every bit a modern 5-star hotel sleek and brightly lit from floor to ceiling windows. Upon arrival our tour group was greeted with the customary hot mint tea. For our included breakfast we had a buffet assortment that was delicious as well as beautifully presented. The pastries were the flakiest I have ever tasted and there is a good selection of meats and cheeses dried and fresh fruits cereals yogurt eggs cooked to order and assorted breads. Getting coffee seemed to be tricky as we waited for what seemed to be an eternity for a waiter to come by to offer coffee. When none came by we then had to go searching for one and request coffee. The first day it actually took about half an hour before we got a pot brought to our table. The second and third days saw us more proactive and we asked a waiter straight away for coffee so our wait was only about 5 minutes since they make each carafe French-press and fresh. Lunch buffets were quite spectacular with dishes representing just about every cuisine. There were selections for sushi tagines pizzas sandwiches pastas desserts and cheeses. While our tour group provided one lunch with our package we balked at the 450 dirham price (about $45 US at 10 MAD=1USD exchange) on our own the next day.    Our room 355 was spacious with a king bed and sitting area. The roomy balcony furnished with banquette seating a small bistro table and 2 chairs overlooked the pool. The bathroom with large tub/shower was well-lit and supplied with high quality toiletries. Despite these first class amenities the hotel room wall was paper thin. I could hear the French couple next door enjoying a very amorous afternoon rendezvous. Nevertheless the hotel is beautiful and not only did we get bottled water gratis we could get sparkling water gratis. The air conditioning worked well so that our room was cool despite the 107 F (41 C) outside.,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Houston,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/txchic

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Tiare A wrote a review Dec 2015,40,Gaudy but lovable,After staying in elegant ryads and hotels in the Moroccan countryside the Sofitel in Marrakech was a shock to the senses. The decor was over the top with no apparent rhyme or reason. The black bull statue with the bright red unmentionables at the entrance is a good indicator of what you're in for at least on the interior design front. However my travel companion and I grew to love our comfortable room; the hundreds of chirping birds that roosted in the colorful bougainvillieas; the gorgeous pools; the mesmerizing fire pit and the sweet staff at the restaurant. One disturbing note: in the nicely appointed outdoor children's area a lone monkey was tied to a cage. The poor fellow looked quite sad and seemed to yearn for freedom.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"San Diego, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/938tiarea

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Traveling S wrote a review Nov 2015,20,Can't call this a 5 star,I have been staying at the sofitel for 3 days now. So far I have changed room three times the first because myself and my husband were given separate beds the second because we were placed in an 'upgrade' located directly above the niteclub and now in the third which is in the older part of the hotel overlooking the pool it's absolutly lovely. All of this is fine except when I tried to change rooms I was left on hold for what could have been forever because the guy on the phone had no intention of helping. Met a differerent staff member at the desk who was very helpful. Next day we went to the gym I wanted to use the pool and my husband the gym that was lovely when we went to leave we were met by an employee who very rudely let us know that the pool is not free to use strange as it is located directly beside the gym and I was led into it by another member of staff. Again that would be fine a simple mistake but the attitude of the staff member was terrible his behavier made us both feel very uncomfortable just not what you'd expect from a five star. I have been to Marrakech many times and am used to the 'you take you pay extra' attitude that has come from an abundant tourist trade but I have also stayed in much nicer hotels such as la Mamunia where the staff will bend over backwards to ensure you enjoy your stay. Considering that is a 5 star hotel based on nothing but it's hospitality I would give this hotel 2 stars. You'll know what I mean if you do end up staying here.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Europe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/283travelings

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Tanya P wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Absolutely AMAZING!,Just returned from our 4 nite honeymoon at this hotel. It was our first experience of 5* and what a wonderful experience it was from start to finish. If you looking for a 5* hotel that is in a very good location and provides luxury and pleasure this is it. Don‚Äôt always rely on others reviews; go with your gut instinct which is what I did. Yes things do go wrong from time to time when you trying to cater for and accommodate so many guests with different expectations.    What sets this hotel aside from any other I have ever been to is the way they deal with errors and misfortunes. If you have the misfortune of something going wrong then I know the man for the job. The ‚Äúguest relations manager‚Äù SOUFIANE MAZZOUJK is a true asset to this hotel. Don‚Äôt rely on the receptionists‚Äô to fix the problems don‚Äôt be too quick to pick up a phone and complain. Go into reception and request to see Soufiane he is the most dedicated; friendliest; helpful gentleman and he just couldn‚Äôt do enough for us. We unfortunately had a room problem on day one which was dealt with and rectified in the most professional manner. I‚Äôm so glad we did or we would never have had the pleasure of meeting him. We would definitely recommend this hotel to any age group with or without families. It was truly a magical experience and we will defiantly stay here again.    ‚ÄúSh‚Ä¶t happens‚Ä¶ its how you deal with it that matters‚Äù!!

This luxury hotel is beautiful but: the toilet did not work well the shower did not drain well (we stood in 3 inches of water while showering) the hair dryer barely had a breeze and another in the closet did not fit any plug there was trash outside our balcony a cabinet did not close all the way the luggage rack was worn and worst there was loud music outside our window from an event at the hotel. I called the desk at about 8 pm and was told it would be taken care of and the woman would call me back. She did not. An hour later I called again and was told it would end at 10 pm. It did not. They finally ended the party at 11 pm. Considering the prices and the Sofitel reputation this was really inexusable. (We had checked in and undressed and showered and were there for only one night which is why we did not request another room.) When we came down to breakfast I gave a list of the problems to someone at reception and said that I think they should give some consideration to reduce the bill. Didn‚Äôt happen. The breakfast was great though. I would not recommend this hotel.,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,New York,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rss1836

This hotel is made of 2 hotels the more traditional one and the more modern one. I was upgraded to a suite in the traditional side of the hotel (platinum card) and my room was really nice overlooking one of the 3 swimming pools (Room 202). I was also introduced to my butler Zacharia a very kind able and knowledgeable man. He gave me his mobile number and I was asked to call him for assistance from transportation to restaurant bookings. It worked very well. I really loved the swimming pool. One can enjoy a Chicha (pipe) on the terrace. There are shops and a great disco open at weekends with a great atmosphere.

Turn down service is not regular and they do not provide washcloths. Finally we reported the volume on the TV was not working. One might assume this was something that could easily be attended to....not so. We asked to speak to the manager and left after waiting almost 10 minutes when told he would be right with us.

We thought they could refund this easily but this has not been the case and after 5 months of correspondence they have been unable to refund us the money despite saying they would do so. I have stayed at a number of Accor hotels in Mauritius and Paris and this is the last time I am going to use them.    The lack of customer service and attention to detail indicates they are behind the curve and there are many other hotels that would love to have my business and those of others.

What a fantastic experience! I travelled with 8 other girls who were all equally impressed with the hotel. From the very moment we touched down at the airport we were greeted by the hotel chauffeurs (you have to book this service) who took us to the hotel in executive Mercedes vehicles the check in was painless and the concierge was thorough but quick in explaining the local area.  The rooms were big and decorated and furnished to a high standard. We were on a hen party and our hen and her sister were upgraded to a Junior Suite which had the added benefit of a HUGE terrace and seating area although being completely honest I‚Äôm not sure I would bother paying extra for a suite. The beds were to die for and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever slept so well! My only comment would be that there‚Äôs very little lighting. A couple of extra lamps would have made all the difference!  The pool area is amazing! The pool is large clean and well maintained the beds are huge and very comfy and you have the added privilege of pre-requesting where you‚Äôd like to sit if you so wish. The pool area is similar to what you would expect to find at a beach club like Nikki beach just without a DJ. The pool food and drinks were fantastic we developed a taste for the cosmopolitan cocktails and ordered several magnums during our stay and they were delicious! And they were very generous with their measures of alcohol.  The food on a whole was to a very good standard with one exception when we dined at Le Jardin restaurant on the first night however we expressed our disappointment and this was dealt with immediately a very lovely and apologetic lady remedied the situation so we still left the restaurant as happy customers. However throughout the rest of our stay the food was great!  Do wonder down to the Spa if you get a chance it really is a beautiful place! We all had a treatment and it was a very relaxing experience. My only criticism would be that I paid for an hour long massage which only lasted 40 minutes.  I have to say the most attractive thing about this hotel is the level of service we experienced. I‚Äôve stayed in many 5 star hotels across the world and I have never known anything like it. Nothing was too much trouble we felt especially looked after by the guest relations manager Soufiane Mazzouj the concierge and our lady who helped us with the restaurant who I believe is called Aida. These people went out of their way to provide us with everything we could possibly want for and made our stay an unforgettable one. They are a credit to the Sofitel brand and I would recommend this hotel to everyone.,Date of stay: August 2015,,"Buntingford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leahk_tc
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Haazy wrote a review Aug 2015,20,"Lovely hotel, staff need training",I'll start by saying this is the most comfortable hotel I've stayed in the beds are hard to leave behind the loungers at the pool are fab plenty of shade if you want and the staff at the pool are brilliant. It's easier to communicate if you have some french but I found this to be the case all over Marrakesh.    On arrival we went through the usual check in process my friend was asked for a card and handed over her visa debit card. She was then handed the keypad and told to enter her pin. It was only after noticing a guy beside us questioning in the amount that we checked. The staff had preblocked 10000 dirham on her card (roughly 1000 euro) I questioned this amount I was told it was standard and we were staying for such a long time 10 days I don't think is so long. I argued the case and was told if i wanted to run a cash account i could so we agreed and they reversed the charge on my friends card. 5 days later she checked her account and noticed the money hadn't come back onto her account. Se called her bank who said that as Morocco isn't set up for visa debit the money had been refunded to mastercard and it would take 30 days for her funds to be freed. Luckily her bank are helpful and said if we send an email to the bank from the hotel they will clear the block immediately. Simple enough request. It took 24hrs and 5 requests we wasted nearly a full day sitting in reception asking for this to be done only for it to be done wrong 3/4 times. Eventually it was done correctly the next day.    On checking out we made use of the courtesy room which is a great facility but there was 2 of us and 1 towel. we requested towels 4 times and still ended up with none.    The hotel itself is lovely.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Titmony wrote a review Aug 2015,20,Huge disappointment !!!!,"We have been here for 3 days and 2 left keeping thinking it cannot get worse... Well it can! We spent 3 days at essaouira's Sofitel and the difference in services is disconcerting.    Welcome was impersonal and cold - no welcome drink or quick tour of the hotel which we had in essaouira.    Room is ok but on small side. Bed however is very comfortable.    Breakfast buffet is nice and varied however waitresses are unorganised and clearly not trained. You can have 3/4 dealing with the same table and it s simply a waste of time. It seems there is a lot of ""supervisors"" doing nothing but blowing hot hair.    Food is good and pricey but not more than any other 5 stars; however it is a bit much for the drinks. The hotel being in central Marrakech there are plenty of restaurants around.    Swimming pools are good sized but the area looks stuffy as there are too many beds/ lounges for the area size. However it is always full so they are indeed needed. People not renting a room can use the pool for a fees (700dhr I think) however you can frequently see one of the pool team letting pp stay for a much smaller fees (handshake with a note is NOT discreet). This is an issue for the management however letting pp using the pool when there are not enough beds for the clients seems not well thought. Again staff is not organised/trained and have had to ask to signed the receipt more the once when food/drinks was served a while before. This is again an issue for the management as they cannot charge the client without the signed receipt.    Noise the hotel has a club and hotel is quite noisy when it closed down at around 4/5 in the morning. It took at least 45 mm for security to come and deal with a naked woman yelling for the police while trying to jump over her balcony. When I called the reception I was told security had been sent and was hung up on. Apparently politeness and excuses were too much too expect.    On the good side one of the door man was really helpful when we had an issue with a taxi. Some taxis will try to charge you more because you are a tourist and even more so when staying in a 5 stars hotel. My husband being Moroccan we have not had much issue like this as he knows the tricks and speaks the language but please be sure that the taxi use his meter. The door man came to help and informed the driver that he has his licence number and police will be called if he keep asking for 150dhr for a 20dhr drive. Reminding him that by law he must use his meter.    This will be my first and last stay in this hotel.",Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Titmony
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Tom M wrote a review Aug 2015,50,Great stay,We stayed for 4 nights at the end of July. We were worried about it being crazy busy with it being the school holidays but fortunately found it exceptionally quiet. We arrived very early and our room was not quite ready however we were given a courtesy and we were also told at check in that we had been upgraded.  When we got to our room we found it large bright and airy with a big balcony over looking the pool. The beds were the most comfortable beds we have ever slept in- seriously good sleeping!  We did have an issue with a light which broke and fell in the middle of the night from the ceiling but this was fixed an hour after we mentioned it to reception although the paint cover up was not the same colour as the rest of the ceiling when it was fixed back in.  The pool area and the sunbeds were the best thing about the hotel. Huge double mattresses with plenty or parasols if needed. Towels there ready for you to use so no lugging lots of bags around. The large pool was the perfect temperature and although the hotel is huge there were only a few other people using it. Service was usually quick around the pool however I did order a drink and waited over 45 minutes for it before I got up and cancelled the order as I was leaving.  Drinks in the lobby also took an exceptionally long time to arrive and not the best service.  Breakfast was great. Our waitress remembered us each day by name and came ready with what she remembered to be our favourite juice and choice of tea/coffee. The breakfast was great although it was lacking in the cooked breakfast area (no sausages or bacon on offer).  The location is great because it is outside of the Medina but you can walk there easily within 15 minutes. We preferred this as the Medina can be pretty hectic and not necessarily what you want each time you step out the front of the hotel.  We got a great deal on the hotel through travelbag website. Things in the hotel are fairly expensive but no more than you'd expect from any other 4/5 star hotel.  Tip: brush up on your French as some people don't speak English well at all.  Thanks Sofitel for a lovely stay. We'd definitely go back for a relaxing stay,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tommP7134MA

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,DimaAkhal wrote a review Jul 2015,30,"Beautiful hotel, great location however terrible service...",My friends and I visited the Sofitel Lounge and Spa in Marrakech during the month of June. The hotel itself is beautiful I was very impressed by the look of the hotel the d√©cor the pool and the outdoor furniture. I have to note however that in the rooms the furniture is old and the carpet is dirty you get the feel that you are staying in an old room which needs cleaning and refurnishing.  The location of the hotel is great the surrounding area is clean and pretty and there are a number of famous restaurants/cafes and shops close by.  There are three pools at the hotel which I think is one of the strong points of this hotel the pools are lovely and the surrounding area is great very spacious and relaxing.  The level of service that we witnessed is what made me and my friends decide that we wouldn't come back it became very tiring when you have to ask for something a few times and wait for a long time.  It may be ok and we stay patient when it is one or two days however this happened every day of our 7 days stay at the hotel. another thing is hygiene there were a few times that I found my cutlery and water glasses dirty at breakfast and in my room.  There are a number of incidents which happened that I do not want to mention.  As mentioned above the hotel is beautiful however due to our experience I do no think I would stay there again.,Date of stay: June 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Doha,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DimaAkhal
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Stewart B wrote a review Jul 2015,50,"Great service, comfort and decent prices",This was a surprise birthday trip from my lovely wife so it was all out of the blue. The old adage - you learn about the service of place when they are dealing with problems was so true of Sofitel. We were initially given a room which rather cramped and with twin beds rather than the double requested. Within 30 minutes we'd been moved to a really nice 4th floor balcony room with a huge bed. Food was great - the buffet at 350DH was terrific value and service close by without being obsequious. The concierge sorted out putting two extra holes in my belt (am losing weight) in an instant. Our night out in town to eat was such a disappointment in contrast - two attempts and leaving both early after crap service and poor food - that we stayed home the rest of the short trip. Our trip was during Ramadan so a little unusual but we liked the low numbers in the hotel and relaxed approach around the pool and restaurant.,Date of stay: June 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Lewes, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/544stewartb

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,LordLucanuk wrote a review Jun 2015,10,Very poor service,This is the first negative review I've written. I won't even due to space and interest include all the issues we ran into during this trip.  Like most hotels they take a swipe of your credit card upon arrival. Here it is a hefty 3000mad (¬£208). On checkout day I was advised that this  fee was un-required and would therefore be refunded. One week later I checked my account and there was no refund. I telephoned the hotel and was  advised that the refund had been made and it was the credit card companies fault and to wait at least ten days for the credit to appear. Ten days later still  no refund so I telephone once again. I am told that the refund has once again been made and that they will email me the receipt as some kind of proof. I have never received any emails. This is now in the hands of my credit card company raised as a dispute claim.    We had numerous issues with the hotel during our stay. firstly the TV and hairdryer did not work. I reported the TV as a fault four times over two days  and at each time was informed it would be dealt with asap. Funny thing is on two of those occasions the reception clerk didn't even ask for my room number. I had  to suggest to them that said room number would prove useful to the engineer. On the fifth occasion I asked to speak to a manager which I did. Thereafter the TV was fixed. There was also a faulty light in the room due to the above I couldn't be fussed about reporting.    If your looking for speedy service as regards to drinks whilst hanging out in any of the lobby/reception/bar areas. forget it. it'll be quicker to go to the bar directly. Service in the bars is poor v's their excessively high prices.    Elements of the hotel are fine it's just so let down by extremely poor service & we had other issues to just can't be fussed to re live them here. I'm done over to  the credit card company to get my funds back and they say this is a five star hotel. I can assure you having stayed in many it is not.,Date of stay: June 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Newbury, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LordLucanuk

The food is decent the drinks are pricey ($12 each) and depending on when you go you may have to pay to enter the pool area of you're not staying there. But it is most certainly worth it!

The Sofitel Palais Imperial is in the same building. I've stayed in both and there wasn't much of a difference.

Great surroundings and some great restaurants and shops nearby. The hotel itself was nice albeit somewhat dated. We were upgraded to a Junior Suite which was great in size but not enough lighting so coupled with the dated furniture made it quite dark. If your room is at the front of the hotel (where you also get some of the nicest views) it can be quite noisy outside particularly with the horses passing by and taxi drivers parking up and talking quite loud into the early hours.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Pviz wrote a review Apr 2015,30,Nice hotel shame about the building work,Reception initially couldn't find reservation - confusion between Palais hotel and Lounge hotel reservation systems aren't linked and the tour operator Thompson didn't even know which hotel either or even that the hotels although one building and sharing facilities are split. Check-in is at 3 - so if you are on an earlier flight eg Thomson's you will NOT get your room before then - be prepared.    The room which was then allocated 164 was directly above some building works - and I mean building works - total gutting - so even though we complained on arrival we weren't moved until 4 days later. The room switch took 6 hours - during which our bags were left unattended in the lobby (despite me having been told they would be moved straight from room to room). Obviously then they couldn't find the bags once we eventually got the new room. Which although a bigger room 219 - a suite- had no balcony and was overlooking a busy roundabout. The Thomson rep was noticeable by his absence and missed several meetings and didn't even bother to complete a complaint form.    On the plus side - the pool area was lovely and one pool was heated.    Good wifi everywhere even poolside.    Food - expensive eg about ¬£10 for a plate of plain pasta by the pool Breakfast was fabulous though.

On first arrival after 30 hours of planes airports and taxis we got to the hotel at 20:00. Imagine our surprise when our rooms were not ready! We had a 45 minute wait before we could go up to our rooms.  On the second check in though things went smoothly which was a blessing given that we desperately needed showers after four days in the mountains.  The hotel itself is beautiful and the decor celebrates Morrocan style in a very elegant manner. Rooms were spacious and quiet. And the hotel is relatively close to the Medina.  Breakfast is extensive with a wide selection of fruit bread cheese and cooked alternatives.  The only problem we found with the hotel was that service was very slow. Be it on the pool deck or the upstairs restaurant which has a beautiful setting the wait is guaranteed to be long. My pet hate: the wine I ordered from the wine list was unavailable!

I've stayed here twice in both the 'traditional' side and the 'modern' side (this place is two hotels linked together hence why it's big so ensure you decide which style you prefer before booking!) and I preferred the traditional more Moroccan feel personally.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,VX W wrote a review Apr 2015,50,Great family hotel with good outdoor swimming pool,We arrived late at night and were warmly welcomed as you would expect from a 5* hotel. Having read that the rooms were hit and miss we decided to play it safe and book a suite. The room did not disappoint and was immaculate. The furniture was new and the both balconies were spotless. Our 5 year old daughter slept on the sofa which they made up into a comfy bed for her. The view was of the Atlas mountains and was spectacular.    The breakfast on the first day was not too good with poor service and untidy tables. The second day we arrived for breakfast much earlier and had a totally different experience with excellent service - attentive to our every need. The food was good with provisions for children such as chocolate spread for pancakes and chocolate cornflakes etc.    There is a Children's suite which we visited but did not use as there were no other children there and it was staffed by a man wearing a rather formal suit! It looked well equipped with an outdoor play area too. They have an interesting activities timetable too.    There is another outdoor play area which isn't signposted and we weren't told about but stumbled across - it has pedal go-karts and a little race track which all the children seemed to enjoy. (It's situated at the front right of the hotel and can be reached if you exit from the So Lounge part of the hotel where the pool table and table football are).    The pool area offers a tranquil escape from the medina and one of the pools is heated although still a little chilly. It's worth mentioning that they have a small monkey kept in a cage adjacent to the pool bar which seems like a strange thing for a hotel to have. It seemed like a very cruel thing to do as the monkey was alone with no activities in the cage and had a chain around it's neck. The monkey is quite tucked away so we didn't even notice it at first but this makes it even more pointless.    The concierge was not very helpful with our transfer to the Sofitel in Essaouira and when he's not on the desk it appears there's no-one on site doing his job. This is a problem for a large luxury hotel like this.    I have still rated this as an excellent hotel as the good things far outweighed the bad and it was very good overall.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sausage1010
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,BiaRioLondon wrote a review Apr 2015,40,"Beautiful hotel, not so great concierge",The hotel is located just outside the medina walls. It has beautiful gardens and swimming pool. The lounge smells orange flowers and is full of comfortable sofas. The restaurants are good but very overpriced. The disco seems to be very popular with locals.  The rooms are comfortable as you would expect of a Sofitel.  The only let down is really the concierge. In a city that you are constantly trying not to be cheated you at least hope the concierge would give good advise but not here. Our day excursion to the city centre was full of traps of buying carpets and argan oils and left out Ben Youssef Madresa which is simply stunning. The concierge sold us a trip to Atlas mountain and told us it was an easy hiking even if he knew we had a 70 year old lady with us. It is simply not possible for a person with mobility issues to climb the waterfalls. Very disappointing.  The taxis at the hotel all try to charge you 100 Dirham instead of the normal 40- 50 for a ride and nobody does nothing about it.,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BiaRioLondon
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,ShabanaHus wrote a review Mar 2015,30,Average 4* hotel,We stayed at the sofitel for one week after reading numerous positive reviews on trip advisor.    The hotel it's self is a nice hotel the lobby area is very big and spacious and the smell is just divine! We had asked for luxury room. The room itself was nice although I do think it is in need of a revamp.    The rooms were very clean along with the bathroom however the bathroom is not one I would classify as a 5star. The tiles and the decor definitely needs updating. This also applies to the terrace the floor tiles and furniture could do with an update.    We had breakfast on the first morning and it was lovely however as it was not included with the room the price for 4 of us amounted to approx ¬£25 a head which we felt was over the dodai. We managed to find a local cafe that served equally nice breakfast for a fraction of the price about 200 yards from the hotel.    Given the time of year we visited the weather wasn't really on our side so we couldn't really utilise the pool area to it's full potential however there were a few occasions where we sat by the pool and the service was extremely slow which is surprising given that this was an off peak season. It took the pool staff almost 30 mins to bring us drinks menu and area wasn't not even that busy. There appeared to be quite a few waiters just standing around however when we were finally served the waiters were helpful therefore no real complaints on that point just the slow service.    On another occasion we were in the bar area and it wasn't particularly busy and we noticed 6 waiters just stood around. No one actually came to give us a menu we had to go and ask for one which in honesty is not something you would expect from a 5* hotel.    We also visited the So lounge on our second night and it was lovely the service was good and the drink we ordered were also of good quality however it was a little pricey! The overall atmosphere of the place was nice. On another night my husband and brother in law went to the lounge again however this time the experience wasn't so pleasant. The door man tried to charge them for entry and when they advised they were guests at the hotel they were quick to change their tune. When they entered there did not appear to be any available seats so a waiter showed them to another seating area which was available however the doorman who originally tried to charge them came over and said the tables were reserved. There was no reserved sign on the tables and I'd just like to add why a doorman would know which tables were reserved or not surely that's down to the waiters. This experience was completely off putting and as a result the guys left.    We did use the spa facilities where we had a facial however one of the ladies that carried out the treatment seemed disinterested left the room twice and appeared to be on the phone. For a five star spa experience this was unacceptable however we did not want to make a fuss however do feel this should be addressed.    The location of the hotel was perfect in the sense that just 200 yards from the the hotel there were plenty of bars/restaurants of great quality. And a further 15 minute walk into the city where we had access to the new town which boasted a cosmopolitan environment.    On our last night we did have a technical hitch with the safe. The hotel staff advised it was due to the battery being low on the safe the matter was dealt with in an efficient manner however in a hotel brand which classifies itself as 5 star these things should be checked prior to check in.    Overall our experience in the hotel was pleasant a perfectly located hotel with easy access to amenities. However given that we paid off peak prices it was suitable however had this been in peak season we would have been disappointed as We have stayed in many 5* hotels and i would class this as a 4* at best. You cannot charge 5* prices and have blocked sinks broken chairs and almost zero water pressure.    Just a to note as well there is a lot of development going on in that area the pavements are dug up and not up to UK health and safety standards haha!,Date of stay: March 2015,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShabanaHus
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Sibtain R wrote a review Mar 2015,30,Marrakech sofitel,We stayed here for 5 nights in March 15. From the website (and the price) we were expecting great things. On arriving at the hotel the lobby was beautiful. However our room (which apparently had been upgraded) was not as expected. The balcony was dirty and the furniture old. It was not bad but for the price would expect more. The service the hotel provide is also sub par and they charge for every little thing eg to drink the coffee in the room or to use the pool table. Again not what you would expect from a 5* hotel.    Overall our stay was average but for the rating and price of the hotel I would expect more.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sraffiq
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,sheepdog50 wrote a review Mar 2015,40,Top class Head Concierge.,Overall we were impressed by our stay but there were a few points that prevent me from giving this Hotel the highest rating.  On arrival we learnt that we were too early to check in which we understood but unfortunately were given impression that our rooms were just not quite ready.After about an hour we were taken to the pool area by a member of the reception team Subsequently we learnt that check in did not commence until 3pm. The pool area is beautiful but it is harder to enjoy when you are in clothes you left a colder UK in. Had it been made clear at reception when check in was we could have used the toilets to change into more appropriate clothes. Our bags had already been taken away. Apparently check in time is on the website but clearly we overlooked it. It would have been simple for reception to say immediately when check in was and could have made ourselves comfortable. Given the time of incoming flights from London this situation must often occur. This is something to be wary of.  As I have said the Pool area is beautiful but sadly staff in that area were quite disinterested and it took a considerable time and effort to obtain a bottle of water.  Two of my party found the beds uncomfortable as they ultimately sagged in the middle. I heard that this problem is known to management.  The Breakfast Buffet is without a doubt impressive and it would be hard to imagine anyone who would not be well cated for but again the disinterest of some of staff was clear Perhaps the 2 managers would have been better employed on the floor rather than sitting on sofas .  We felt the hotel manager was aloof and very selective who he spoke to. His welcome was not universal to all guests. To be clear we were not expecting him to fawn over us but simple acknowledgement or pleasantries when passing by would have been appreciated. Clearly we were not as valued as others.  .  The outstanding member of staff was the Head Concierge Reda booking trips restaurants and offering advice. He has a wealth of knowledge and was so happy to help us. I would recommend anyone staying here to seek him out as I doubt if there is anything he doesn't know or can't arrange. He is the real star there. Our stay in Marrakech would have not been anywhere near as enjoyable without his unfailing assistance.    It was only through the service we received from Reda that I have rated this hotel as very good as otherwise it was average. It is by no means a bad hotel despite length of my review. This is a hotel that is failing to quite reach its potential . It is clear there are those who are aware of the shortcomings I have highlighted. I hope consequently these can be addressed and lift the hotel to the level I believe it could be and where owners would like it to be.  Admittedly I suspect I may have left a better rating if I had been one of the guests who seemed to get more personal attention.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Caterham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sheepdog50

It came to the attention to the staff of the occurrence and everyone offered their condolences to us and the subsequent service was wonderful to behold. It must be noted that regardless of this situation the service of the staff and thoughts are impeccable at all times. We would just like to pay a special mention to a few people namely who were exceptional Moustaf Abdeerazzak (Barman) Oussama Youner and Laila Siham and Allall on the service section of the hotel. Wiam (Manager) always welcomed us anywhere in the hotel we happen to meet and made sure that nothing was too much trouble.

On arrival we were greeted promptly and told we had a room upgrade which we appreciated! We then went to have dinner and cocktails in the SO Lounge - a bar/restaurant in the hotel which was great. It was my Mums birthday and the staff went out of their way to help us with our celebrations!    We had breakfast everyday which was great - lots of choice and even some gluten free products which were good. A special mention to the staff who worked at breakfast - Abderrahim Mohamed Youssef Hassan Jamaal to name but a few who really went out of their way to be helpful accommodating and provide great service. This service was replicated throughout the hotel and especially Rachid (worked on the Sofitel Imperial reception) who helped us plan some day trips.    As well as the fantastic staff the hotel itself is amazing - beautiful grounds wonderfully comfortable bedroom and a superb spa which was so tranquil and relaxing. Location is great too - not far from the airport and also only a 10-15 minute walk into the old town.    I really cannot fault anything - again I would highlight the staff are a real asset to this hotel. Polite helpful and friendly - even when they had to deal with a few difficult and frankly rude guests at times. They really helped make out holiday special.    I was so sad to leave and am already planning my return visit to the wonderful city of Marrakech and do plan to stay at the Sofitel Lounge & Spa again in early May - I'm hoping to book my stay very soon!,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/248CherylM

The service at The Sofitel is excellent with nothing ever being too much trouble and have plenty of staff ready to cater for any of your wishes. Knowing the problems we had with flights and getting there they had kindly upgraded our room etc. We were looked after a lot by a lovely waiter called Karim whose English is brilliant and even followed me around with coffee when moving to sit outside. The breakfast is excellent with a good selection of pastries eggs cheese ham and fruit.    We did venture outside the hotel for a few hours for a camel ride see the tanneries herbalists etc but really we were happy to stay within the hotel with their heavenly gardens pools spa and excellent customer service.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,John P wrote a review Mar 2015,50,A beautifu Resort in Hivernage Marrakech,Stayed in Sofitel Spa & Lounge beg March with my wife as well as my daughter & her husband.  Check in was extremely cozy since they get everything done for you while you are begin served some special tea. The Reception has this beautiful Moroccan style which already puts you in the right mood.  The Deluxe room we booked was very comfortable with a wonderful view over the piscine area.The bathroom was all the necessary amenities as well as a big bath tub which I always appreciate.    Plenty of trees surround the pool which give you this sense of being in the country side. Although the hotel was fully booked it was pretty quiet since the standard of the clients is quite elevated here.    We dined at the So Lounge where we had very good salmon sashimi for starter which was a pleasant surprise for us all. My daughter Micheline had a stir fried chicken which was delicious & we ended up all sharing it while her husband went for the shrimp pasta which was also very tasty.  My wife had the monk fish which was the best of all orders while I had the trio of lobster / shrimps & calamari which was recommended by the waiter. Very good quality food while the service was also of a high standard & very friendly.  To top it all off the singer was superb while the band was very lively contributing to a very lively & entertaining atmosphere over all.  What was extremely good was the breakfast which included most types of French cheeses along with a big selection of cold cuts which we highly appreciated.  Juices were prepared for you on the spot while there was a wide selection of fresh fruits to choose from. Marmelades / waffles / croissants Danish pastries were all there in a very orderly manner while am sure I forget so many other items I cannot recall. Had some amazing fried eggs with bacon & the staff was always smiling & present in spite of the fact the place was buzzing.    In the afternoon we spent some nice time in the elevated heated private pool which had a superb view of the hotel. We were not happy with the fact they asked us to pay 40 Euro / person just to sit there ( apart from the orders we would place ) but were pleasantly surprised to be told they would waive it! Ended up having some good wine glasses & fresh juices there & full enjoyed our time & the tranquility of this beautiful spot.    Booked at the Spa for the 4 of us today where everything was well organized & the responsible lady very helpful.    Overall this is a very nice Resort that I would definitely recommend to anyone who wants 5 Stars Luxury in Marrakech without being overpriced. The fact it is so close to the airport as well as to other top notch resorts like Mamounia or Four Seasons is a plus.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Alexandria, Egypt",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnpJ7825VR

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Teka-teeks wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Go here for Royal treatment,I stayed here during the end of February JUST before the temperatures went above 23 degrees.  Upon arrival we were greeted immediately by the frontal staff with such a friendly welcome our bags taken to the concierge then being welcomed by the door staff with warm delighted smiles and cutesy. We were led to a sofa to wait on our check in which only took a few minutes and the minutes were so we could be welcomed in style. We were attended to by the best host ever 'adelakeem' he made sure we knew his name 'akeem' meant Docter loves him! he poured us tea in style and offered us sweet confectioneries. He was beaming with life and friendliness he had made our welcome perfect.    We booked bed and breakfast and the choice was amazing and the food was delicious!  Even though the service was buffet self service once sat down we were offered extras to our breakfast like tea juice staff are everywhere and willing to cater to you. I cannot stress friendly service enough. And in such a classy hotel.    The decor is to die for! Such elegance and vitality.    We tend to go out every day and evening especially for dinner but we did have a few cocktails at the hotel and lunch by the pool side. We had chips and a margarita and olive pizza which was lovely I even ordered more chips they were so succulent. My favourite cocktail was 'lady' could not get enough.    Service at the pool was superb there are staff around everywhere that are there for your every need just catch their eye and they cater to you bringing you your orders etc.    Note: the courtyard around the pool is basked in the sounds of peaceful birds chirping very refreshing in the mornings soothing in the evenings and serene during the days! It dreams PARADISE.    I had also noticed they are very polite and good with kids from observation 'chilling in the sun'    The room we stayed at was comfortable clean and beautiful we had the view of the atlas mountain in the far beyond and a pond with fish and turtles below.    One bad note was on the day after the first night we came back from at out to find out room had not been cleaned we left again to chill at the pool until we got tired from the sun came back to rest and our door locked at about 4:30 for cleaning.. We had to send them away that was way too late and I wanted to sleep. They passed by again to ensure we had clean towels and water. They then cleaned the next morning without fail.    The sofitel seemed to be the most luxurious hotel in the area from going on various tours around the area. When we were picked up and dropped off by out your operators other holiday makers never failed to ask us about how the hotel is they were always looking on from the vehicle.    I commend and praise these staff for making our time extra special... Adelakeem taoigif charafeddine and oh I've forget in two others the tall guy that is always by the pool helping others always there making us feel catered for if we needed anything and this sweetest dear at breakfast who normally situates himself near to the entrance door offering tea/ coffe/juice. As I often dined at breakfast alone and he was there to make me feel confident. He had a lovely sweet fave and smile.,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Teka-teeks

The service and quality was excellent as anticipated and the staff were fantastic particularly in the Palais Darkum which was one of favourite place to sit and enjoy a drink. We particularly want to mention Assia Aziza Hind Mohamed and Nezha who were extermely helpful and friendly and are a credit to the hotel.    The only negatives to our trip was that the evening restaurants/bar were not wheelchair accessible. Therefore we had to utilise room service for our evening meals and whilst the food was lovely it would have been nice to be able to eat in the restaurant. We also found the wet room in our room was extremely slippery and both of us ended up slipping when getting out of the shower. We have mentioned both of these things to the hotel.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Christina H wrote a review Feb 2015,40,Nice luxury hotel,You get really great service here they want you to be happy wheter you are at your room eating inside or at the pool.. The room has a big fabolous bed. It takes 15 minutes to walk in to the city center(Medina Jmaa el Fna) and there is a supermarket close. Transport costs 70 dh to the airport but 100 dh from the airport. Sofitel has a lovely big breakfast and a great pool/lounge area with sunbeds. The water is cold in the wintertime so don't get your hopes to high for a relaxing swim here.,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/326christinah

Beautiful pool area great breakfast and friendly staff particularly the staff at breakfast who make you feel really welcome. Good bar and charming staff there too reception staff were ok one reception manager had real attitude but apart from that everything was great. Food is expensive if not included and indoor pool costs ¬£ 20 per day but you won't need this if the weather is good as outdoor pools are amazing plenty of sun loungers and hammocks.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Chen W wrote a review Feb 2015,50,"Great stay, will come back",Never stayed at Sofitel before so we weren't sure what to expect. First impression was excellent very tastefully decorated throughout and reception staff are all polite and attentive. We had an upgrade to a junior suite which is a nice surprise. The suite is quite spacious with double balcony and south facing. It is at the end of the building therefore quiet. Breakfast is in the main buffet restaurant plentiful and all the waiting staff are very attentive. We had dinner one night in the lounge where there was live show and three other nights at the A-la-carte restaurant. The former has a quite lively atmosphere with good food (and huge portion); the latter is a classy proper restaurant with very high standard of food and service and we were very pleased dining there. There are French and Moroccan choices but we found ourselves keep going for French dishes which were so nicely made. We did spend some time on pool side every afternoon which was nice and quite because of the off-season we reckon.    What made the stay special is all the staff members working at the hotel. Everyone of them is genuinely willing to help and very pleasant to talk to. Fatima at the breakfast Omar at the pool side Youssouf at the dinner restaurant just to name a few. One thing we were very impressed with is that in one evening we were making our way to the old town and one of the hotel staff working in the lounge the night before recognised us on his way home after finishing work at the hotel he walked us to the old town and said goodbye afterwards. It wasn't his job at all to accompany us but he was willing to spend some private time to help hotel customers and we really appreciate his effort.    Overall a very very pleasant stay and such a beautiful welcoming and well-managed hotel. Would definitely come back.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,oakwoodclock wrote a review Feb 2015,50,Exceeded Expectations,This was the first visit to Morocco and the first time we had stayed in a Sofitel and we were a bit apprehensive having visited many parts of Africa and the Middle East.  From the moment we arrived at the hotel we were made welcome by Yussef who looked after the luggage. The bedroom and bathrooms were clean with lots of good quality toiletries towels and bathrobes. The beds comfortable and large.  Our room was at the back of the hotel and there was some noise from the air conditioning units serving the meeting rooms located below but when the doors are closed this is minimal although if you want to sit on the balcony it can be annoying.  Breakfast offers a great choice and if anyone is not satisfied then they must be miserable having a bad day or just plain awful to be around.  We liked the fires lit in the garden at night so that you could enjoy a drink and chat and Nawfal and his staff looked after admirably and even remembered what we had been drinking the previous night. Drinks are not cheap a 300ml bottle of beer is ¬£7 and the cheapest bottle of wine over ¬£20.But alcohol appears to be expensive in this country. Not the place for those that like to get drunk every night!!  We were staying as part of a golf package and our clubs were stored safely in a locked room and brought to the car when we required them by enthusiastic staff.  We met Sofia a Junior Manager during the managers reception on Monday night and what a star she turned out to be. Full of life and a real love for her job and making sure that the customers are happy and trying to eliminate the problems of they aren't. If every company had a Sofia they would benefit.  Fatima one of the waitresses gave excellent advise for the back problem and the ginger shots in the morning really do work and make your digestive system function.  The gardens and swimming pools are impressive and the outdoor heated pool was warm and ideal for swimming in even when the temperature drops.  The only downside was the check out and getting Nehdi to understand that we wanted to pay in Dirhams and not ¬£. Perhaps some training her on the card machine as it clearly stated ¬£ and he insisted that we would be charged in local currency as the hotel dealt in Dirhams. The 3% service charge was not significant but it all adds up to the cost of the holiday.  Overall impression: Great hotel wonderful friendly staff and we look forward to a return visit. Would certainly recommend and we will now look at staying in Sofitel's in the future.,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Leeds, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oakwoodclock

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,HelloT2013 wrote a review Jan 2015,20,Will never go back here again after the service we received,We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights and from the moment 'go' it was trouble! Took 1 hour and 10 minute to check in. We were offered no food whilst waiting even though we told the woman at reception that we are very hungry and fed up! We were told to wait or have a look around the resort while they try and trace the booking! By the time we got the room we were shattered infact they ruined our plans because we were so tired hungry & put off!  Got into the room and bathtub was filthy and iron wasn't working. Asked for a new iron and housekeeping came to drop it to us.. knocked and within 2 seconds of knocking walks straight into the room!  Another time we had house keeping walk into our room after a single knock again walking in after literally 2 seconds! We had the sign on 'do not disturb!'.  Towels had lipstick stains on it.  Our balcony door was left TWICE open by housekeeping. Sink was blocked housekeeping fixed it. Next day it was blocked again!  We asked for a wake up call on night 2 and no one called we almost missed breakfast. We had 30 mins to get ready and go down and eat!! We ignored it. Day 3 we asked for a wake up call and explained that 'we didn't get it the night before so please make sure we get it today'.  Day 3 and no wake up call. We ended up missing the breakfast completely!  We were offered free breakfast by manager but it's not the same as the buffet we paid for? It was our last day at the hotel and the day's plans were ruined and wasted because we woke up late due to no wake up call!  We were offered a lunch & shisha by manager which is fine but it doesn't compensate for the amount of money we spent on the hotel and within the hotel during our stay we had the suite and spent extra for this as it was a special occasion. The staff service was slow. A lot of the times they were just talking among themselves or on their phones. Once we stood at reception which was empty with only 3 staff members. We stood waiting for them to finish talking and laughing around. It took them 4 minutes to acknowledge that we were even stood there!!!    Overall the hotel has potential lovely location all facilities are available. Beds are comfortable and there is a good choice of breakfast and food overall throughout the hotel restaurants. Its a shame that the service was sooo poor that we would never recommend the hotel or go back.,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelloT2013

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Rashikalpana wrote a review Jan 2015,50,Brilliant experience,Stayed at the Sofitel Marrakech Loung and Spa for a week commencing 5th October 2014 and had a wonderful and memorable time at the hotel and in Marrakech itself.  The weather was perfect comfortable warm and sunny. Have always stayed in 5 star hotels and this was equally impressive though individual. Especially as we enjoyed the benefits of two hotels in one Palais Imperial and Lounge and Spa both of which are connected by the very welcoming and spacious reception area. After the long wait at Immigration the welcome and efficiency of the staff made us forget out irritation and tiredness.  At time of booking no rooms were available in the Palais Imperial however on arrival we found that we were upgraded to the Palace rooms which have a modern yet traditional feel to them. Only disadvantage is that they are located a distance from the hub of the hotel.  Next day we requested customer relations staff Loubna at the front reception desk if we could see the rooms at the Lounge and Spa which were more modern and the decor light and airy and more importantly closer to the main entrance to the hotel.  These were more favorable to us therefore on request Loubna very kindly arranged for us to be relocated and all our luggage was effectively transferred to our new rooms which were equally comfortable as the first with all the expected facilities.What would have been a nice touch was a tea/coffee tray in the room as room service was a little long in coming though when it did arrive it was presented as would be expected from a 5 star hotel.  As regards to the hotel it is very very well maintained and the decor is pleasing to the eye and kept spotless. All around the hotel there were plenty of well proportioned comfortable seating areas to relax in and the scent was heavenly. There are four swimming pools one at the Spa for the exclusive use of those having treatment and the smallest pool is usable at extra cost. Of the further two pools one is heated. What is wonderful is that there are plenty of sunbeds around all the pools which are located in the well maintained gardens.  As for the restaurants we ate at the L'Orangerie Le Jardin and the Oasis where the food was cooked to perfection and of highest standard. However as the days went the service got considerably slower which was disappointing. The other thing our group felt was that a smoking area so near to the eating area at the L'Orangerie was a little offputting. The staff at all the restaurants were impeccable and the surroundings were excellent. A special mention to Hind at breakfast time who greeted us with a smile and ensured our teas coffees fresh orange juice arrived promptly. A special mention to Rida the concierge who was very helpful in organising trips transport and respective guides which made all our outings very special and enjoyable.  Our thanks to the guides who were very respectful informative and attentive to our wishes and to our safety.  We the family of six are very pleased with our choice of hotel. The staff have been very pleasant and professional. Particularly Loubna who works at the reception desk was so very cheerful helpful and nothing absolutely nothing was too much trouble. It is Loubna who made the stay even more memorable and is a credit to the hotel.  A very heartfelt thanks and regards to her from all the family and best wishes that she succeeds in everything she does.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Leicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rashikalpana

But this year I was really excited to see they have added a brand new private pool and Lounge to the property called the Ultimate Pool Lounge what can I say‚Ä¶ it was FABULOUS!! A very intimate warm relaxing setting with the most beautiful and breathtaking views of the Atlas mountain. Now you have to pay extra to enter this section but I genuinely think it‚Äôs worth the money. I was treated like a VIP guest as the staff never seemed to be far away when I needed another drink or food. I have to commend Sofia the manager at the Pool lounge; you can tell she runs a tight ship with her team! I am always impressed by her professional approach to customers and her staff.

There was not one aspect of the experience that was anything but outstanding. Starting with the genuine people who make this destination a fulfilling journey to an already recognized world-leading destination Marrakech. Absolutely every single person on staff is friendly outgoing and has the pleasure of the guest as their only concern. And this is not just through corporate mantra or proper training but comes genuinely from the heart. As an experienced traveler to many of the leading facilities throughout the world I can honestly say this place ranks among the finest if not the finest all-around experience I have had. The location is prime but as interesting as Marrakech is one finds themselves just as pleased to remain on-site in order to enjoy this place as much as any destination in the area one would care to visit.    The accommodations the lounge the dining the spa and common areas are all first-rate. I would defy anyone to find the beds anything but among the finest they've experienced no matter the property. The food is outstanding in every aspect from quality to creative preparation to abundance. Chef Ahmed Eddefaa warrants particular mention. In addition to his outstanding culinary skills his attentiveness to the guest is extraordinary. Every possible need is met and complete satisfaction is assured.    One other individual who should be specially noted is Mr. Mazzouj our PR Director. No request is beyond his abilities. He was terrific.

Split into two ""themes"" the Palais Imperial and the Lounge & Spa which is more modern. Both sides are very well decorated with a feeling of luxury / quality all around. The rooms are well equipped and comfortable - probably just about what you would expect from a hotel of this quality. We stayed including breakfast (didn't eat lunch / dinner at hotel so cannot comment) and the choice of food was incredible far beyond anything we have experienced elsewhere. What really set this place apart for us was the quality of service from the staff with each and every person going out of their way to help. Jihane (guest relations) ensured that the TV was set up to show English football matches Amina at the front desk gave us great tips and suggestions of where to go / eat whilst Fatima / Karim (as well as Rachida / Benayad / Nouihi / Hicham / Chahira / Azly at breakfast) all went out of their way to make sure that we were enjoying ourselves and had everything we needed.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,thedaintytraveller wrote a review Dec 2014,30,Not a 5 star luxury hotel.. So not worth it.. But,Ok.. So for what I paid and a supposed 5 star luxury hotel. THIS IS NOT. Here's the thing the quality of the rooms would be fine for best western prices. The beds are comfortable and the sheets and towels are clean.. But that's standard! And the prices are luxury. You have to wait forever for room service and the first room I was in had no wifi. The signal couldn't be picked up anywhere so I had to change rooms. Also the carpet floors are not that clean and the lighting in the room is very poor.. I think it's so you don't notice the not so clean rooms. The finishings in the bathroom are poor and there is an opening between the glass door for the shower and the tub that makes water go everywhere on the floor.    Positive:    The staff is very friendly and they do go out of their way to help. The breakfasts are DIVINE! You have never seen a continental breakfast like the one here. It's far from continental! There is a juice bar pastry eggs Moroccan dishes.. And a man outside frying Moroccan fresh donuts! The food was definitely 5 star.    If this hotel was cheaper it would be ok. But for the expensive prices... Nah. there are other 5 star hotels in Marrakech.,Date of stay: December 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Toronto, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thedaintytraveller
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,mitzideluxe wrote a review Dec 2014,40,Best pool area ever,Check in and welcome: When we arrived we were brought to the reception desk of the Lounge and Spa hotel part; A receptionist took our passports and credit card and left; We had to wait for more than half an hour until my husband asked for somebody to take care of us until the staff brought us our documents and handed over the room keys.  Room: Mattresses pillows and linens were nice but the carpet furniture and bathroom has to be refurbished and changed urgently: The carpet was dirty the furniture shabby and the bathroom old; The Lanvin toiletries were nice; The glass door and windows towards the balcony were not cleaned properly and were really dirty; Free wifi everywhere.  Pool area: The pool area is exceptional and the best we have ever seen: Very stylish lots of daybeds for a lot of people; Good food in the restaurant with attentive staff.  Outside bar area: Nice ambience towards the fire places; Very friendly and attentive staff.  Breakfast: Lots of variety and choices also between Moroccan and continental breakfast; relatively attentive staff (except one lady did not understand that we needed a large spoon).

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,J A wrote a review Dec 2014,50,This Hotel was exceptional,We travelled as a family of 3 with a young baby 16 months from the moment we step out on the red carpet of the hotel we felt like we were royalty. The first impressions of the hotel reception was that is was amazing stunning d√©cor and and a real feel of luxury complimented with exotic relaxing aromas and we were offered mint tea while we waited to check in.    We received a complimentary upgrade to one of the imperial suites with a balcony overlooking the pool and the room was like an apartment separate lounge separate bedroom 2 bathrooms - 1 bath and 1 showeroom our son zakariya just kept running around in this huge space and exploring. The rooms were of very high standard and our housekeeper Wafa was brilliant on a daily basis would deal with our small requests and needs for our child Wafa saw that we kept heating up the baby milk using kettle water and a pot so brought us a electric baby bottle warmer which made our life simpler and easier Wafa was really friendly helpful and really thoughtful if we went back we would love for Wafa to look after us.    The pool area is nice and relaxing the pictures speak for themselves a real sense of luxury.    Breakfast at the hotel was always a lovely experience with a huge variety to choose from freshly made omelette and pancakes and more! the restaurant staff were brilliant sofia one of the managers each morning personally came and greet us and welcomed us. restaurant staff like  farah Hakim were really helpful. The service was really good and we took extra long to eat and finish with a child and were really good with our crying baby.    The hotel gives a very personal service by day 3 everyone knew our son zakariya by name and always took time to play and joke around with him one of our butlers was called Zakariya too who was really helpful as was Mohammed the porter would help when we came and went from the hotel.    Overall we would recommend this hotel service was excellent and you get a real feel of luxury at this hotel very child friendly and accommodating even provided us with a travel cot.,Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/429ja

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Biren S wrote a review Dec 2014,50,Best holiday stay ever,The wonderful people working at this gorgeous luxurious hotel made our stay totally unforgettable. We arrived at the hotel around 12 pm noon time on Sunday and there were a couple of people checking in. We were politely requested to sit on a comfortable sofa and offered an aromatic towel to freshen up and delicious mint tea while waiting to check in. I approached the desk but the lady at the desk (Noura) politely said she would come to us with everything done. She also completed forms for us to sign up with Accor hotels to get offers and free upgrades. To my pleasant surprise she upgraded us to junior suit with Atlas mountain view. Thank you Noura! The suite was gorgeous with modern furniture (a complete sofa set dining table two televisions marble flooring and two spacious terraces). From our bedroom we could view the majestic Atlas mountains.    The hotel is just outside the Medina (old city) so it was a gentle stroll (about 500 metres) to visit the famous Jemma El Fna square and Koutubia mosque. Location is about perfect as one can avoid the very hectic and lively pace of life inside the Medina and still be part of the charming mayhem at will. Also taxis horse carts etc. are easily available from the hotel.    The hotel has more than 300 rooms so one would expect more business-like and less personal approach towards customers. However we were pleasantly surprised that almost every staff member was very personal and warm towards us. Most of the time we didn‚Äôt need to approach them as they themselves figured out what we wanted and did their best to exceed our expectations. I am sorry I don‚Äôt remember everyone‚Äôs name (my memory is terrible !)‚Ä¶the lady with the specs (who has visited Delhi Mumbai and Goa) and came all the way to show the spa and So restaurant / lounge and explained in detail about food and drinks available at different restaurants (also chatted animatedly about Moroccan people and culture)‚Ä¶the shaved head gentleman with a hat who served with smiling face during morning breakfast and also at pool side‚Ä¶the cleaning lady who meticulously cleaned our room and every evening visited us to ask if everything was alright in our room (and also once presented beautiful rose bud)‚Ä¶ We have visited more than 25 countries so far (including most of Europe and America) and this was first ever hotel where nearly every staff member took great pride in offering their best service. Well done you all‚Ä¶pls keep it up ! Speaks volume of the warmth of Moroccan people and Sofitel culture. The breakfast was sumptuous and we were spoilt for choices ‚Äì Continental Moroccan (Harira soup was awesome) Fruits fresh juices (freshly squeezed pomegranate juice was my favourite) dry fruits selection of cheese and so on. We were served at table fresh juice tea etc. when requested. Every now and then every person (including manager) at reception lounge pool asked us how our stay was at the hotel and if they could do anything to make it better‚Ä¶ Not expected at hotel of this size.    The only areas where I would suggest a little improvement is cashier and concierge service ‚Äì as there was a little absence of attention when dealing with the cashier (some sympathy with people dealing with money as having done cashiering myself in early stages of career I know dealing with money is a bit stressful). Pre-authorisation on our credit card was taken but we were not given any proof when leaving the hotel that the pre-authorisation will be cancelled. Only orally confirmed so I would say this could be made more professional by presenting valid proof of cancellation of pre-authorisation when checking out. Also the concierge gentleman was keen on selling us Atlas mountain holiday on a definitely cold and rainy day (Monday 24 November 2014) ‚Äì we politely refused and didn‚Äôt visit the service again (partly also because we wanted to make the most of Medina part of the city during our first visit of Marrakech).    This was first hotel where we stayed more in the hotel than visiting tourist places just to enjoy the facilities of the hotel (our lovely suit heated swimming pool and garden spa). And still we couldn‚Äôt visit its lovely restaurants (four of them if I remember correctly) as we tucked in lots of street food at the famous Jemma El Fna square; also I couldn‚Äôt find time to visit the gym of the hotel. Maybe next time ‚Äì Marrakech is beautiful and lively place and Sofitel made it even better experience.    In summary I would say Sofitel Marrakech is a jewel in the crown of Accor hotels. We would love to visit Marrakech again to enjoy the hospitality of your hotel.,Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/birensarda

Breakfast was excellent with a varied selection. Weather unusually cool and rainy prevented us from sitting outside by the pool which looked lovely and inviting. Tried dinner upstairs in the lounge with live entertainment (two guitars) which was pleasant. Service at the front desk was prompt and courteous. My request for extra water in the room was somehow never met; and one day they forgot to provide hand towels - so just some little things that still need attention given the rating of this hotel.

Lovely building decent spread for breakfast great lounge area by the pool good restaurants lively bar and the spa is lovely it was so tranquil and nice we went there two days in a row.    However for a hotel of this level I expected a little more with the service. Reception appears to be understaffed and check-in took about 20 minutes even though no other customers were visibly present. There were problems with the mini-bar fridge and bathroom sinks when we arrived and had to ask 4 times before someone attended. The concierge leaves a bit to be desired - ahead of arrival we arranged transport for several days throughout our trip - the emails were abrupt at best.

Arriving at lunchtime we made our way to the buffet which was good but a little expensive especially if you only wanted a light snack. By the far the most disappointing aspect of this hotel which marred our stay was the checkout. We were slightly pushed for time and in front of us was a lady complaining about her bill. with only one person attending to this and the other member of staff doing nothing it was a complete shambles. I had to interrupt to say that I was in a hurry to catch a flight (as it turned out I need not have bothered as Marrakech airport was a complete joke - a total lack of security and lots of queuing!!) and asked if there were any other staff available - there wasn't!

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,PDA68 wrote a review Nov 2014,40,Best part of Sofitel for view of garden and pools,We booked this part of the hotel for the reason the rooms are nearer everything then the rooms in the Imperial Palace part. We stayed in the Imperial Palace in the beginning of our trip and changed it over to the Lounge and Spa for the end of the trip and it was a good choice. Room has al you need and a comfy bed. Very good views of the gardens an pools and near the restaurants. the hotel is situated in the Hivernage quarter next to de Es Saadi The Novotel Suite Hotel Hivernage and the Pearl. We we're very glad with our choice and being out of the medina. Choosing a hotel in Marrakech can be tricky but you just have to make up your mind if you want to stay in the middle of the hustle and bustle (medina) or just out of it. just out of it it also means that a car can pick you up and drop you off at the hotel door. In the medina some places are remote from the road and it means that you have to find your way through the alleys to your hotel or riad. The rooms in riads in the medina are mostly smaller too.,Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Adinkerke, Belgium",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PDA68

Upon arrival we were offered beautiful mint tea and reception staff were very attentive. Although we had a mix up with our rooms they changed us with no fuss and were very pleasant. Even had macaroons in our room with a gorgeous view overlooking the pool area and the city. On our first evening we stumbled across The So Good restaurant/bar in the hotel. Amazing mojitos in the most gorgeous setting (lanterns and cushions and candles everywhere) and the waiters were of an excellent standard. I had the lamb with prunes in the most gorgeous tagine. To die for!    Breakfast in les jardins is amazing. Beautiful fresh pastries and fruit (especially the pomegranates) along with a wide array of traditional Moroccan delicacies and hot food. The staff are a joy and couldn't have done enough for us they seemed very genuine in their approach.    We ate lunch around the pool skewers prawns... Delicious!

First the location is perfect and the hotel is magnigificent everything is perfect the rooms with the vie and the food and the pool arias. But this is something you can find everywhere almost in marrakech. But there is one thing that makes us come back and that is the employees and there are 4 persons that really stands out. First its samira samira is this lovely beautiful girl working as the manager in the bar near to the pool. She welcomes you and helps you as you where really close to her. Nouafal works there to and he is sutch a gentleman and always a smile on his face that shines your day . And then we have abderrahman he is the boss when it comes to rooms and helps you with everything you need to make your stay as good as possible and at his side there is Ismail who helps you with the rooms to. They together are excellent how would our stay be without them. For us as you can read its not just an hotel they makes us feel like home but in a more warmer and exotic country. So if you visit marrakech this is the place to go. You will not regret it.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Keelybos wrote a review Nov 2014,50,Fantastic hotel if you are travelling with children,We stayed for 3 nights with our two children (aged 7 & 2) at the end of October. It has to be said it really is the staff that make this hotel. There are elements of the decor which are a little tired in the interior of the hotel but the pool facilities are fantastic with one of the pools heated (much needed during our stay) and really comfortable sunloungers which were plentiful. The team at the poolside were fantastic and the waiter who served us each day couldn't do enough for us he was incredible.  The children were fussed over and really made to feel welcome. There are small touches for the younger guests like the pedal karts and track at the front of the hotel and the giant chess set and wooden table games in the gardens which make for a more interesting stay.  Breakfast provided an excellent choice and variety of options which were all beautifully presented. Again it was the small touches like having a buffet for kids with mini croissants and small packets of  Kellogg's cereal which sets the hotel apart. Farah served us each day at breakfast and a special mention must be made of her exceptional service guests care and patience! Her smile is constant and she is unflustered even when very busy. An absolute star.  The location of the hotel is very good. We walked into the main square and labyrinth of souks in less than 15 minutes. There are a number of very nice restaurants within very close proximity which we used rather than eat in the hotel. (The main restaurant in the hotel is lovely but the menu was just too formal for my kids). Access from the airport is also very quick-we used the hotel car for pick up which cost more than a taxi but for the convenience and comfort very worthwhile.  Finally my husband arranged a cake for my birthday which I celebrated whilst staying at the hotel-it was left at turn down service came personalised and tasted delicious! We are very grateful to Hamid Atoul Rachid Ritam hassan Meriem and Amine who arranged this for my husband with less than 24 hours notice-they did a super job and made me cry! Happy tears thankfully!  In a nutshell I'd happily return. The staff are fantastic the location is great and the pool is superb-sad to be home!,Date of stay: October 2014,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Keelybos

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Barry W wrote a review Oct 2014,50,Delightful,Stayed at the Sofitel for a week in mid October. Perfect location close to the airport and old town. Wonderful ambience and aroma on entering. Upgraded to a junior suite with views across the swimming pools to the mountains.Beds a little lumpy. Not seen a hotel with so many restful sitting areas both indoors and out always quiet places available. I cannot compliment the staff too highly. Nothing was too much trouble. Lovely breakfasts. I would particularly praise Farah the waitress Atoul for room service Safa in the Spa and all the reception staff. A perfect place to return to after a long day out. A less formal and earlier dining option in the evenings would be a bonus.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barryw601
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,kalidiso wrote a review Oct 2014,20,Surprisingly Terrible service and communication marred good facilities and location,Oh dear where to start.    I'll be specific with multiple examples of poor service unexpected for a Sofitel that really ruined our stay. The smaller boutique riads offer better value/service. Given the multiple issues experienced by myself and friends - am surprised at this score.    1) Upon arrival despite booking and checking-in (!!) the newer lounge and spa we were moved through the building into the older Imperial WITHOUT our consent. The hotels adjoin each other so we didn't realise we had been moved until next day our friends described their rooms. Having unpacked and settled we chose not to move but were unhappy.    2) Despite confirming bookings for spa they did not have our appts - only after complaining did they then accommodate our original timings.    3) Despite email explicitly asking for a ladies hair appt (wash/dry/pin-up) for my partner (we had a wedding to attend) the hairdresser didn't know how to pin-up hair!! They found another hairdresser who then proceeded to do a poor job (pins fell out on way back to room). Despite listing a hairdresser on the website the hotel is clearly unable to offer a quality full service.    4) When requesting shirt pressing was told someone is coming 20m later.. called again.. they said coming nothing. 15m later I left the room. When eventually next day shirt was picked up was meant to be ready by 2pm shirt only returned when chased at 4pm... seriously? Am i meant to be chasing staff.    5) Breakfast very overpriced. Go to the cafe literally across the road - great food on third of the price.    There is a general 'lack-of-responsibility' culture and poor communication with the staff. Upon problems occurring no one takes responsibility or tries to fix.    Only when pressured or complaining or with escalation do things get fixed.  Poor communication is also to blame.. if there is a delay/problem - then why?    Its a large hotel and maybe it was a busy period but we had around 10 rooms and others also had problems ranging from pungent and/or unmade rooms being offered to malfunctioning AC with consensus around generally lack of responsiveness    I complained extensively and so got some resolution needless to say having to complain about basic simple things ruined our stay.. Those without the inclination or demeanor to complain as I did would probably suffer here in silence.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kalidiso
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Indy1978 wrote a review Oct 2014,40,Marvellous Marrakech stay,We (myself wife and son) had a few nights here in late October and really enjoyed our stay.    It is about 10 mins from Airport the cab driver charged us 200 Dhs which may have been steep. I should have seen if the hotel provided a transfer.    Our room was magnificent very spacious and a lovely comfy bed.  The pool and surrounding area were excellent very relaxing and friendly service.  The front desk were professional and couldn't do more to help. In particular a lady whose name may have been Safaa who was lovely.  The breakfast was delicious and quite good value.  The one thing that stops me from giving 5 stars was the rest of the dining options. Many dinners did not start until 7:30 which is quite late for my 2 year old. There was the choice of the room service menu in the outside bar area which we opted for. I would have preferred a poolside or separate bar food menu available during the early evening hours for those who want another option as ordering from room service menu could take 40 mins and on one occasion my pizza was not hot.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,VandSNadarajah wrote a review Oct 2014,20,"Staying at Sofitel - Ok, but not great",On our 10 year anniversary and booked the Sofitel because it came across as quite plush and the place to have a bit of an indulgent week. The surroundings are admittedly luxurious but it ends there. We were put in a junior suite but the bathroom was badly designed - anytime the shower was used there ended up being a great deal of water on the floor and we had to use half of our towels to keep it from going into the main room. The separate toilet was a bit dated and small. We were ok with these anomalies but not with the staff service which was actually quite appalling. A couple of times my wife asked questions at reception about facilities how to get to a restaurant etc. The staff were dismissive of her to the point to rudeness. In fact one of the night clerks went so far as not even to say anything but just gestured for her to speak to the concierge turned his back on her and pointedly played with his mobile. What made it even worse was that a few seconds a European couple walked up and he was all light and sweetness. It is quite apparent that he thought that since she was Asian and a female he did not need to show the respect she deserved as a guest. This happened to a lesser extent several times - when she ordered tea on the terrace and it took ages to come and when it did it was done grudgingly; when we were waiting in line to speak to the concierge and a random Middle Eastern guest jumped in front and he started to engage with her despite seeing us in line until I seriously lost it and told both of them this was unacceptable and that she needed to wait her turn. I am logging a complaint with the general manager over these issues but it is quite clear that the staff have a superiority complex as well as giving a strong impression of racially-segmented behaviours. This is unacceptable. I have stayed in many great hotels across the world this is the one where I have felt the most uncomfortable and I would not choose to stay here again any time soon.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VandSNadarajah
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Miriam H wrote a review Oct 2014,30,Better but there's still room for improvement,This was our second stay in Marrakech‚Äôs Sofitel Lounge and Spa and after the first stay we had no intention to ever come back. Well here we are and we must say we expected less than we got.    The room we had two years ago was worn down and small. Now we got a beautifully renovated room with a large terrace. The beds were too soft for our convenience but others might like it that way. Reception staff was nice and efficient and even the concierge tried to be friendly and helpful this time. Big improvement!    The best experience we had was dinner in the Lounge‚Äôs outside area called ¬´ So Nice ¬ª: This is a stunning garden bar/restaurant: Lights and candles cushions fountains... marvellous surroundings! One of the most beautiful garden restaurants we have ever been to! The food was delicious and the young lady who served it was charming and professional. We‚Äôll be back for more!    Unfortunately there are still quite a few downsides and some of them leave you speechless:  We asked for a quiet room and got one in the first place but found the loud life music from the Bar/Restaurant in the Courtyard most annoying. You can hardly avoid it as virtually all rooms face the Courtyard. I don‚Äôt really understand why a Hotel that has a Bar/Restaurant area where they can play life music and no one is bothered (the ‚ÄûSo Lounge/So Nice‚Äú) chooses to play music in the Courtyard as well: There was a handful of guests in the Bar but about 100 rooms that were affected by the noise ‚Äì probably not a good choice.    The spa/gym area is nice and well equipped. But if you‚Äôre looking for those refreshing 5 minutes in the indoor pool after a workout: Be careful! You‚Äôre not allowed to use it ‚Äì or you are but you pay extra if you haven‚Äôt got a spa treatment. The same goes for towels in the changing room: You don‚Äôt get one unless you have a spa treatment. Imagine: Your workout is over you‚Äôve just had a shower ‚Äì but no towels! Sorry. And yes we claim to be a five star-hotel.    BE CAREFUL WHEN HAVING YOUR LUGGAGE STORED !! Only when we picked it up did we realise that it was stored OUTSIDE the storage room in the Hotel entrance area out in the open space and 30 m from the street! Anyone could have walked up to it and just take what they want. ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE and a no-go for a hotel of this category.    All in all this was a nice but still mixed experience. We still feel that not enough effort is put into figuring out what makes a guest happy - unfortunately a nice location is not enough. Do we come back for a third stay? We don‚Äôt know yet.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Zurich, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/684miriamh
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Tim Y wrote a review Oct 2014,40,"Second best hotel in Marrakesh, probably",We arrived on a late flight but the reception staff were unprepared and unprofessional. The atmosphere in the lobby was louche and heavy with cigarette smoke the upshot of some event at the main hotel bar which we didn't fancy paying to get into. The room we were given for the first night was next to a bank of AC fans and noisy.    The atmosphere the following day was different for the better. The breakfast was excellent in terms of food quality and choice and service. Afterwards we were able to move room and the reception staff were professional particularly Amina. The rooms themselves are well appointed comfortable and evidently normally peaceful. It was my birthday during the stay and the hotel surprised me with some cake in the room.    All areas of the hotel were pleasant and broadly 5* level. The spa isn't the best I've been in but is perfectly reasonable and there was an attractive deal available during our stay. The outside areas with two pools was well kept and had enough sun beds for everyone. Getting hold of a towel was a protracted process however and the pool guys weren't very helpful.    In the evenings the piano bar was lovely - often with local music playing in the background.

Our check in was relatively smooth although a little slow but after reading reviews of this problem lowered my expectations and just went with the flow. We allocated a lovely twin room on the fourth floor. The room was lovely and clean with everything you wanted with the Lanvin Toiletries Bathrobes Slippers etc and a fab balcony with table chairs and Day Bed the afternoon sun was just lovely there. The maid service in the day was spot on and we also got the turn down service every evening with clean towels and topped up toiletries. The Mini Bar didn't get replenished but we just asked the reception desk on the way out to dinner and when we got back it had been stocked :-)  The Breakfast buffet was incredible they even had a Smoothie Chef to make up whatever you want :-)  The Pool was amazing and the service staff were very attentive.    We visited the Spa for a Facial and it was so relaxing and the products used were beautiful.    The concierge was wonderful arranging our taxis for dinner and calling ahead to the restaurant so that they could send a staff member to meet and greet us :-)    We will definitely be going back to this wonderful hotel well done and Thank you to The Sofitel Marrakesh :-),Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharonH853
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,APDubai wrote a review Oct 2014,30,Did not meet my expectations,Charming building good food comfy beds friendly staff nicely landscaped. Wi-Fi didn‚Äôt work in our room had to stand in the hallway to get any sort of signal after calling the reception on 3 different occasions right from day 1 on arrival the Wi-Fi started working on the 3rd and last day of our stay in the hotel. The other thing that I found extremely odd and rather inconvenient about our room was that fact that the toilet was on its own right when you entered the room in a fairly small space but no sink in sight!!! The bathroom sink and the shower were in a separate area of the room on their own. All that aside my major concern about this resort  given the price range and the fact that they claim to be a ‚ÄúLuxury‚Äù resort is that they forgot to mention a ‚Äù little‚Äù detail about the pool tile removal and replacement project right under our window that was in full effect every day. And the grand finally we were awaken on our last night at 2:30 AM by lovely sound of the pressure washer compressor under our window being used by the hotel staff to clean the common area and around the pool when I phone the front desk to complain about the noise I was told ‚Äúsir we do all of our maintenance and cleaning during the night‚Äù they did eventually stop.

The hotel staff were extremely tired and level of service was low.    The hotel was also under construction and this should have been mentioned in the booking advertisement.    The hotel is extremely over priced e.g ¬£8 for a conflict coke.....I'm not sure even the Ritz charge such ridiculous prices. The hotel food was absolutely horrific and again ridiculously expensive for what is was worth.

We stayed at this hotel 2 years ago and gave the benefit of the doubt for the initial bad service because we liked the hotel and visited again. This is not a CHEAP hotel it is expensive to stay eat and drink. Returned in September for 15 nights after staying at a Sofitel airport hotel (subject to an excellent separate review).    Pros  Has a beautiful majestic setting  In a good location near the medina shops and high quality restaurants  Spectacular gardens reception area and terrace  Great pool area    Cons  Booked hotel transfer at 250 mad they weren't there when we arrived  Booked a non smoking room given one with an adjoining door where the smoke seeped under the door  Check in took 45 minutes to be told room wouldn't be ready until 3pm and they would call me when ready  Didn't receive a call and returned at 4pm room wasn't ready told to return in 30 minutes as the hotel was full  Ordered refreshments at the pool waiters ignored the request on several days  For 6 days of the holiday housekeeping had to be contacted daily for towels which hadn't been replaced  Rooms often not tidied until after 5pm  Couldn't use the balcony because of bird poo on the day bed which was only cleaned on the last few days  Carpet was never hovered  Bathroom floor never cleaned  Sink was cracked  Carpets throughout the accommodation areas were worn  Accommodation area was tardy dirty and weary  No Tea or coffee facilities in the rooms  Sockets hanging out the wall  Bulbs removed from the lift one out of six in place  Lift alarm activated no one responded to confirm if this was an emergency  Person injured at the pool and asked for a first aid kit no one appeared  Building work on-going putting pools in and ripping a new one out  Too many people in suits looking important but not being responsible or accountable for anything  When complaints were made to a manager they didn't resolve anything  Waited 20 minutes at check out to allow 5 staff to finish bickering in front of two customers    To summarise lacks customer focus and service lacks management structure responsibility and accountability obvious deterioration with minimum maintenance in the accommodation areas.

Farrah and Hicham work in the restaurant as a servers. They are kind hard working and have the brightest smiles and purest hearts. But what really stood out for me. Is the morning breakfast is a buffett. Farrah made sure I ate my morning breakfast. She cared for me in the most nurturing of ways. My face buried in a computer she would come and gently tell me not to lose my focus and ask me what I would like and go to the buffett to get me breakfast allowing me to sit and focus on my work. So my best description of Farrah is‚Ä¶.Thoughtful and kind. The ability to observe a stranger and anticipate there needs. A rare and beautiful quality in the hospitality business. Now Hicham was my IT guru at breakfast. He would sit and fix all my problems and did so with generosity and kindness. Imagine a waiter willing to help a stranger fix all her gadgets‚Ä¶.Now that's service!

Pool area fantastic. Would recommend for a very relaxing break. The hotel is expensive for food drink massages compared with the local area. There's an inexpensive cafe/restaurant called Extra Blatt about 3/4 minutes walk away which is perfect for lunch and a Carrefour about 10/12 minutes away for water/snacks    The hotel offers a limousine service from the airport which is the same price as a local taxi. A great place to stay if you want an enjoyable and relaxing holiday.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,england,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ukchris78

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,David D wrote a review Aug 2014,30,"The sun shone, sadly the hotel didn't!","We booked a family hotel for a short break in Marrakech and thought we couldn't go wrong with the Sofitel 5* hotel. On arrival the Ferrari and the Lamborghini dazzled in the sun outside the entrance and the reception area was full of people. When we tried to check in we were told we had to wait 2 hours to as we could only check in @ 15:00. So we sat outside in the bar and cooled down with a drink. At 15:00 we were told the room would be ready shortly as ""someone"" would not move out of their room till late so house keeping were preparing the room - 15mins and things will be ok. 30 mins no room an hour past no room! Surely we could just check into one room and wait for the 2nd. After 90mins we were allowed into one and then another hour later the second room! After lots of complaining and a total wait 4.5 hours they offered to pay for dinner as it was my wife's Birthday. Every day reception was full of guest waiting on their rooms well after the 15:00 check in time! Through till 18:00. Surely not more guest who don't want to leave!  Pool over crowded and full of posers who constantly took selfies and changed their bikinis at lunch time. Food was great cocktails great service great!

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,KTOLE6 wrote a review Aug 2014,20,Stunning hotel. Ideally located. Poor service.,I have always loved a Sofitel and will usually always opt to stay in one if given the choice however this one lets the brand name down a little:    The good : The hotel is stunning. It is a gorgeous mix of moroccan culture and modern decor. It is also huge with massive lobbies and walkways meaning you never feel cramped or on top of other holiday makers ( although be warned the pool area gets very busy and we found it near impossible most days to find a sunbathing spot.)  It is also ideally located. You are no more than a 15 minute walk away from all the local amenities such as the Medina cafes shops and restaurants. ( do not feel guilty about ordering a cab though in the Moroccan heat 15 mins can feel like hours) so in terms of aesthetics and location top marks.    The bad: On more than one occasion we were left waiting well over an hour for menus to arrive at our table when trying to order a poolside snack hollering down staff seemed near impossible and many holidaymakers were actually leaving the complex to get refreshments elsewhere as they were tired of waiting. When we were finally served our menusfood coming out was again very slow and the wait for the bill and change was painstaking. We found this to be the case when relaxing in the bar in the evening also. Getting served is like finding a lake of water deep in the Moroccan desert - a real rarity nearing on impossible!  Although our rooms were cleaned and tidied daily quiet often they would forget to replenish towels meaning we had to head down to reception and request clean towels be sent to the room. An hour later no towels. 2 hours later no towels. The towels never appeared. Our complimentary dressing gowns also went walk about after day 1! I know this isn't the end of the world but there is no better feeling than getting out of a nice warm shower after a hot day and into a white fluffy robe. We had this privilege once. We hAd the privilege of clean towels being left without nagging twice! Poor.    The ugly: They advertise high speed wifi. The only thing high speed about the wifi was my temper trying to access anything online! It was slower than slow and rarely worked. Incredibly frustrating to say the least. I know when abroad internet access shouldn't be all that important but lets be honest it is 2014 and we all want to access our emails and check social media when on holiday. If you have any plans to do so at this hotel change them!    In summary the hotel itself if large spacious beautifully decorated and ideally located and don't get me wrong the staff are very friendly and polite but the service is diabolical. Looking at other reviews many people have had the same experiences as me and nothing appears to have changed. How can this hotel warrant 5*s?!?,Date of stay: August 2014,,Chelmsford,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KTOLE6
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,SP0505 wrote a review Aug 2014,10,"Horrific, shocking and disappointing - don't stay here!",I stayed at this hotel for my mum‚Äôs 60th birthday and a friend‚Äôs wedding (luckily the wedding was not at this hotel).    Prior to arrival I was liasing with the hotel to confirm my reservation and room bookings. I had to book 2 rooms as they could not accommodate 3 people in one room. Despite numerous calls from London where the call would be disconnected put on answermachine for more than 40minutes or being passed from one person to the next I managed to confirm my booking and in particular an early checkin (due to our flight arrival) luxury room with pool view and balcony (which was upgraded as there was availability and due to the inconvenience with the calls) and non-smoking room (I had numerous discussions with Hanene from Guest Reservations who actually didn‚Äôt action anything what was agreed so wasted my time and incurred my telephone costs).    Upon arrival I was told both rooms were not available. I was told I would be contacted within an hour having given them more than 2 hours I went to the checkin desk and told to wait. The reason the room was not ready was the mini-bar ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think it takes 3 hours to check the mini-bar even at the slow pace they work. Normal checkin time is 3pm ‚Äì it was agreed prior to my arrival to have both rooms that I booked ready for 12pm (with Hanene who disappointinly failed us). I did not get my room until 4pm ‚Äì to my shock was given a disabled room with an awful shocking smoking smell. One of my family members is an asthamatic and cannot stay in a smoking room. Also there was no balcony as I was offered a ground floor room (not as per my room booking). I dealt with a staff member called Fatima who was rude and unhelpful. Having expressed my concerns and after another hour (5pm) I was then offered a ‚Äòdecent‚Äô room for the 1st night and then moved on the 2nd night to a room which was originally agreed (Marouane ‚Äì Front Office Supervisor managed to sort out after all the inconveniece I was caused) ‚Äì not a great start to our holiday!    The shocking bits:  Firstly although the pool is nice what we saw was horrific. When guests leave the pool their towels remained on the sun loungers/beds. The towels are left to dry for a period of time with the pool attendees coming to check if dry if not they are kept out. The pool attendees then come to check if dry (by patting each towel) then folded for the next guest as they remained on the sun lounger/bed. Not only disgusting and unhygienic but not what is expected from a Sofitel chain. I even had to tell some of the guests to ask for clean towels as this is what they had done and were about to use the ‚Äòused‚Äô towels. When questioned a pool attendee the response I got was ‚Äòthis is what we are told to do!‚Äô My advise if you do stay at this hotel ‚Äì bring your towel from the room!    At breakfast as lovely as the display of foods. One day they served melon and pineapple that was gone off and I got severely ill. When I told the chef they tried it admitted it had a ‚Äòfunny taste and must be bad‚Äô and removed it from the breakfast. This resulted in 3 days of me having diarrhoea and severe vomiting.  The staff would handle the pastries with their hands despite servering cutlery being available ‚Äì no wander I found facial hair (eyelash) in both crossiants and pastries ‚Äì basic hygiene requirements need attention. Breakfast is simple fruit and pastries ‚Äì no cooked breakfast.    I was on a half board basis ‚Äì warning: you need 3-4hours for dinner. It takes 30minutes to just bring a menu another 45minutes to bring drinks. The pace at which they work is alarming and they have no sense of time when serving ‚Äì whether they want the restaurants to look busy or genuinly are sluggish I do not know. You might as well eat out as the food standard is not of a typical Sofitel expectation.    Housekeeping ‚Äì be prepared to ask for toiletries and towels as they often ‚Äòforgot‚Äô to replace when towels were clearly on the bathroom floor for replacing and the toilet roll had finished! A lot of chasing and had to look for them as they didn‚Äôt come within an hour to replace.    Check your bill on checkout ‚Äì despite half board basis I was charged for meals. I requested the staff to check the bill and correct. I was told to come back in 2 hours. Again after painful 2 hours nothing had been done by the reception desk staff at Lounge and Spa. At this time the reception desk was closed and I had to go to the other Sofitel desk to sort out. They charged me for minibar use and restarant bills which was inaccurate ‚Äì corrected after checking restaurants bills that I supposed ate when I was on a day trip and when all minibar items were accounted for ‚Äì becareful they don‚Äôt cheat you and take a copy of all signed bills. The hassle to sort this out was painful and the checkout staff were extremely rude (Aberrahim) and again sluggish they clearly have time but don‚Äôt realise you don‚Äôt! At least the duty manager (Mohammed) tried to sort it out after 2 hours.    I was so surprised at the standard of this hotel ‚Äì definitely not a typical 5 star hotel. It is cosmetically nice but when it comes to service and hygiene it wouldn‚Äôt even meet a 3 star. It was such a disappointing holiday and a hotel from hell‚Äì I would never go back or recommend anyone to stay here ‚Äì you are better staying at the Hivernage Spa and Hotel which is round the corner!,Date of stay: August 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SP0505

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Sarju P wrote a review Jul 2014,30,Not what I would expect for a 5 star Hotel,We stayed here between 23-26th July for our 9th Anniversary. We arrived a little earlier then the check in time. We were asked to leave our mobile number and told they would us when our room was ready. 1 hour later I went to ask for an update as by now we had gone past the check I'm time. I was told that the room is nearly ready and that they would call in 45 mins. Another hour later I went back to the reception and was given our room cards. We were first given room 169. Upon entering the room we saw that it was nice clean and welcoming. The wet room was nice too. We decided to have a short nap however we noticed there was an error message on the ac controller so it would not work. I called reception and housekeeping both to inform them of this and I was told they would send someone. An hour later still no sign on of anyone so again I called reception and housekeeping and was told someone was on their way. Another hour passed and still nobody came. We decided to go out so on our way out we informed reception that the ac still hadn't been fixed we were told it would be sorted by the time we got back. We came back after a couple of hours and surprise surprise ac still not working. I rang reception and insisted in having our room changed. I was told they have another room for us however it is on the other side if the hotel. I said as long as the ac works I don't mind where it is. A little while later we were still waiting so I made enquiries with reception about our new room.mminwas told there had been a shift change and the new manager did not know about this. Upon hearing our problem he immediately arranged a new room for us. This room was less luxurious then our previous room but we were happy as we had ac. However pigeons constantly sat on the balcony light and their waste was constantly dripping into the outdoor sofa so we could not use it. All in all the staff were friendly however I would expect a lot more for the price we paid. The bed and pillows were fantastic.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Alicia A wrote a review Jul 2014,10,"So bad, we didn't even stay...",Having stayed elsewhere earlier in our stay we booked Sofitel as a last night luxury end to our trip to Marrakech based on the brand & reputation plus the fabulous images on the website.    The check in process that then took over 3 hours meant we completed wasted our last day in Marrakech (and at 45 degrees heat very uncomfortable) and left completely disappointed & extremely upset - plus out of pocket. We ended up booking somewhere else locally and leaving as soon as we could.    On arrival the porters were impolite no greetings and suitcase disappeared and a bag tag just shoved to us with no explanation.    Check in after being handled by 3 or 4 different people took close to 3 hours - first told the room would be ready in 20 minutes then offered another room in the Palace side of the hotel (which we declined as was not what we wanted or had booked - the receptionist even agreed it was not nice); we left the hotel for lunch and still no room. No apology or service when we finally got a key.    The room unfortunately looked nothing like the website - rips in furniture a broken glass smell of paint and overlooking a maintainance site. We were kindly moved - but back to the same palace side we had declined hours before. Maintainance work in the hotel & corridors made it feel very unluxurious - understandably work has to be done at some point but there was no reference to this on the website or at the time of booking.    We were also told by a member of staff that they were only just over half full anyway and with the size of the hotel I am sure this service issues could have all been avoided.    I would never recommend this hotel - it looks tired and the service was no where near 5 star. On a positive note the receptionists despite looking on the whole quite embarrassed did want to help as much as they could.,Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/967aliciaa

Reading previous comments some people have left unjustified remarks leveled at the Hotel in my opinion!....that is to say `Arabic culture and climate differences CAN lead too misunderstanding!` However there are standards that must be kept under the Sofitel brand. The Hotel is well located near the Medina just 10 minutes walk. It is very safe at Night and Day but if you prefer you can get a Taxi very cheaply. The Sofitel is not well sign posted but most people know where it is.    The Bar/Waiting Staff stood out for me. They were all very friendly and excellent at their Jobs; more than willing to give advice too. I wrote down some of their names....SoufieneSumine Nassima Hind Wassif Mehdi and Ponof (apologies if i have spelt any names incorrectly!)    I also had my first Hamman scrub and massage. I would without doubt recommend it! The Masseurs and all the `So Spa` Staff excelled themselves. It was clean friendly professional and above all `so` relaxing!    I had one complaint during my stay.. The room I stayed in was very noisy due too many frogs croaking in the Pond below. I agree that its part of nature and not the Hotels fault but I needed a good nights sleep. However the Hotel promptly moved me to another room the next day and I had a beautiful sleep. (to rectify this problem perhaps the Hotel could seal the sliding Patio doors a lot better.    The breakfast was faultless. It catered for most international tastes!

At the front door Karam and Yousssef make sure that your luggage finds it way to your room that your taxi is in time and knows whrere to go. In my case a wheelchair was needed - this had been organised by the concierge who also introduced us to Larbi Benis who proved to be a fine driver/guide for our trips to Ourika Valleyn Imlil and Essaouira. Small attentions make a difference : a fresh rose on the bed in our impeccably made up room was just an added bonus. At breakfast ( I have never seen such choice nor such quality) we had our daily chat with Rabil about the birds in the garden  while enjoying our excellent coffee. In the Orangerie the daily double menu (french or moroccan) was great with a good choice of wine and the professional but extremely friendly attentions of TalalAtika and Mohamed... The pools are just what we wanted : lots of space to sit around comfortably - great service from the pool bar and big enough for a brisk swim . The in-house hamam is a real bonus with great staff and such a lovely place to relax in.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Ed M wrote a review Jun 2014,40,Beautiful but rough round the edges,(1/6/14 - 6/6/14) This was our second stay in the Sofitel Spa & Lounge in 2 years and again was ideal for our 5 day get away. We had toyed with staying in a Riad but having a pool was a necessity which a Riad couldn't supply. The pools at the Sofitel are amazing we tended to stay around the smaller pool which had ample shade during the peak heat of the day. The staff are happy & friendly so the service I can not fault however there were a couple of niggles.    The food in my opinion is over priced for the quantity you get although don't get me wrong it is good. I do however begrudge paying ¬£10 for a bar snack pizza by the pool.    Personally the rooms were the biggest let down. We eventually moved rooms after we found it difficult to sleep due to the frogs yes frogs that were singing until the early hours our mini bar fridge sprang a leak which caused a huge stain on the carpet and we had a balcony facing the road which had locals shouting at all hours. Please note the beds may look appealing at first glance and may even feel like laying on a cloud but be warned they offer absolutely no support! I'm in my late twenties with no normal back problems one night in that bed & I was walking around like a 90 year old I digress.    The room move was swift and pain free we were even upgraded to a suite but I couldn't help feel the rooms were beginning to look a bit rough around the edges. I might sound picky but a 5* hotel should not have cracked sealant around the bath or a shower in the bath which is near on impossible to use due to being behind the taps without an extendable head.    Overall we had a great break which was enhanced by the hotel however I hope they do not rest on their laurels and past successes and strive further for pure 5* luxury.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Norwich, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/865edm
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Karen B wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Everything you could want and more.,This was my first visit to the Sofitel in Marrakech and I was not disappointed by the experience.  The hotel is excellent and of a very very high standard. It is also in an ideal location and within easy reach of most local amenities and night life.  The rooms are excellent. They are immaculate spacious and very comfortable. The pool area and gardens are also fantastic. I really enjoyed the choice of restaurants and the excellent range of quality food offered. I also highly recommend the cocktail bar.  One thing I must comment on is the first class service from the staff. Nothing is too much trouble whether you need a restaurant booking a taxi or just some directions. Everyone is incredibly hard working and I felt very comfortable venturing out on their recommendations and guidance. I would like to give a special thank you to Sara in guest relations. She is helpful pleasant and happy to help whatever the situation. Whenever I saw her she was always smiling and would always say hello and ask if everything was okay. It really shows that she is caring and committed to delivering excellent service to guests and is an asset to Sofitel.  Overall I would highly recommend a visit to this hotel as Marrakech is an amazing city and staying here will greatly enhance any visit. I will definitely return for a longer stay.,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenbX3292BK
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,vakamalua wrote a review May 2014,40,Lovely Hotel: But Avoid the Second Floor!,This is a lovely hotel with a great pool area for lounging. It is walking distance to the Koutoubia Mosque and the Souks. We had a very nice and spacious suite overlooking the pool area with an incredible view of the Atlas mountains at sunset. The balcony was enclosed by flowering bougainvillea vines with birds flitting through them; but don't leave the balcony door open or the birds will hop right into the room. The breakfast food was good and extensive but getting decent service depended on how busy they were at the moment. The big problem was that our room was on the second floor right over the lobby--obviously there are speakers in the lobby ceiling which means the second floor rooms have loud music playing in them from 7:00 am to 10:00 pm! We asked them to turn the music off or adjust the volume way down and they acted like they'd never heard the complaint before which would be impossible given the volume; even though they promised to do so they never did.,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"reston, va",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vakamalua

The rooms are large and comfortable all the amenities are in place could be a great place.But...  Checkin- We were greeted by the reception and seated at the lounge a very nice lady took our passports and went to register us we were offered tea and biscuits  and then went on waiting for almost half an hour to get our room.  Service- Lovely poolside with nice cabanas  asked for the towels ... the guy said ""yes right away"" and we never saw him or the towels . waited for someone to take an order for the bar... no one came for 1 hour until I went to the bar myself only to be told they can't serve me and I have to wait for a waiter to come to me...  Wi-fi- saw many comments before about how poor it was. The previous posters were generous!!  AC did not work in one of the rooms.First night we sweated it out and in the morning asked for the AC to be fixed. Front desk said ""sure no problem"" returned in the afternoon and saw nothing was done. Went down and asked again... ""sure  no problem"" returned at night and sure enough... nothing was done. second night sweating.. on the third day in the elevator the cleaning girl greeted me and asked if all was fine. I said ""yes but the AC does not work"" It took her 10 minutes to get the repair man and fix it!!!  The kettle did not work I asked to replace it... won't bore you.. just like getting the AC fixed.  Front desk are useless!!!  Saved the best for last.... Checked out at 5:55 AM came back 5:59 to retrieve a jacket I forgot.  The front desk clerk was in the room saying he was there to prepare the room for the next guest.....  After such an inefficient front desk experience I should have guessed something is wrong and since when do the front desk prepare rooms and since when do hotels prepare rooms at 6:00 AM???  When we arrived at the Casablanca airport we realized we left a wallet in the room as well.  We sent our guid to the hotel and they told him no wallet was found....

Allocated a 'quiet' room overlooking a noisy construction site within the hotel -next day I invited the manager to visit our room to share our experience -he was unavailable so we had a visit by the room allocations manager.(see photo) When asked why rooms overlooking a construction site were not closed down to paying customers and the time used to clean the carpets and curtains and repair the broken items in the bathroom he replied (with some embarrassment) that it was not Sofitel policy to close rooms during construction.  He re-allocated us another 'quiet 'room overlooking a main road into the city!!(see photo)  Pool area was very nice and staff very pleasant and helpful -again pool furniture was very badly stained and dirty.  Breakfast was adequate and service OK as long as there was not a large delegation in the hotel --then service was poor.  Overall the week we spent there was not a good experience and the manager could not be bothered to find us to offer an explanation or apology.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,bazandbabs24 wrote a review May 2014,40,"Great hotel, staff need better service skills though! Worst Wifi ever",For a bit of luxury this is a top hotel compared with the chaos and bustle in the Medina - it's nice to get away to at the end of a busy sightseeing day.  The check-in was unusually long and overly done - you are asked to sit down and wait in reception and then someone goes through paperwork and familiarises you with the hotel. I guess they think it's a personal touch but is actually a bit laboured and annoying! A quick and easy check-in is all that's needed.  The rooms are are OK although could do with more lighting - was always pretty dark! Beds are very large and comfortable. There are no tea / coffee making facilities or iron / ironing boards in the rooms. You can get one from housekeeping but the irons have seen their day and don't work very well!  Wifi at the entire hotel is totally useless - worst I have ever experienced and is so bad they may as well not have it - not sure if it is just a Moroccan problem or the service is inadequate for the number of guests they have - at least it's free.  The pool is amazing and service pretty good from the staff there. The breakfast service was not particularly good - a lot of staff milling around ignoring customers. You had to almost beg to get coffee / juice and the same for refills.  Meals at the restaurant are good but are around twice the price of going into the Medina. Drinks are prohibitively expensive and DO NOT go for the waiter's recommendation of a glass of champagne or mojito before your meal - unbelievably expensive!!  All in all would recommend but would be great if the hotel could sort out its breakfast time staff and the awful wifi!,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bazandbabs24
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,LauraParis_France wrote a review May 2014,40,Disappointing stay in what should be a very good hotel,First off it should be noted that the pool area of the hotel is great. I would actually go back just to enjoy lounging there all the sun beds are modern and the gardens are very well kept. There is sufficient pool staff to assist you.    However despite the good facilities of this hotel we still had a disappointing stay. There were numerous issues:  - the bed: was surprisingly uncomfortable. My husband and I both lay down and then sat back up and looked at each other thinking something must be wrong with our bed. We look it over entirely and couldn't understand the sheets and mattresses layout (very odd) and didn't have a comfortable sleep.  - the check-in: the check-in process was quite long  - the housekeeping staff: it took three phone calls to housekeeping to get an ironing board  - the room service: our order came and was incorrect  So these issues and several other small ones led to a disappointing stay.,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Paris, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LauraParis_France

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,thewelltravelledfamily wrote a review Apr 2014,50,WOW - AMAZING - WORTH EVERY CENT,We stayed at this hotel for two nights. When we walked through the doors we were greeted straight away taken to the reception and checked in. A lovely fellow kindly walked us to our room and on the way said that we had been upgraded from the room we booked which was the Junior Suite with view of the Atlas Mountains to the Suite overlooking that Atlas Mountains and the Pool. All I can say is WOW. As you walk in to the hotel you have SO much space and cupboard space. You have a dining room a living room a double balcony with sun bed and table and chairs an extra large bedroom with massive king sized bed and more drawers then you have the Bathroom with more cupboards a bath shower over the bath plus your sink you then walk through to the second bathroom which has a separate shower toilet and sink. There were 4 towels HERMES shampoo conditioner body lotion and body wash exfoliator scales (if you want to weigh yourself on holidays....) and two amazing robes and slippers. There is a Nespresso Machine in the room and you get the first 6 pods free plus you get 3 bottles of water and 1 sparkling water per day for free. There were also a dozen red roses in the room. The bed is one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in!    The view overlooking the pool was amazing so relaxing. The hotel itself is massive there are several restaurants and the breakfast range is like I have never seen before. They have everything you can think of and I think it is worth every cent (although it seems expensive).    We ordered room service for the first night (and second night) and when it arrived it came with a handwritten note and a birthday cake wishing my husband a happy birthday - I didn't order this! We had a note on the booking but didn't remind them or ask for it. It was amazing and so generous of them.    The pool area is awesome. There are two outdoor pools and many many poolside beds. You do need to get in early if you want one by the pool or in the sun! They fill up so quickly. We had ordered a fruit platter and some drinks by the pool - very good service and the fruit is delicious fresh and nice and cold.    We also had spa treatments in the hotel. We got the traditional Hamman a body wrap and a massage. The spa area is beautiful you get a robe and slippers and you can also use the facilities such as the steam room and indoor heated pool. The staff are very helpful and the services were really great as well.    I couldn't fault the hotel or the staff I found everything to be of excellent service and quality. I know you pay a lot of money to stay there but you do get value for money and I would recommend it even if it is for just two nights of your stay in Marrakech - just perfect.,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Brisbane, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thewelltravelledfam
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Carol W wrote a review Apr 2014,30,Return visit - a little disappointed,This was my third stay at the Sofitel. It's a luxury hotel beautiful surroundings but sadly a couple of things were not up to standard. Firstly during the day when we were relaxing poolside there were building works (including a tractor) not very relaxing we couldn't go back to our room as the building works were happening directly outside! We were not informed of this nor offered an apology of any kind. The service around the pool was poor this time around (there were 2 men that were doing everything) we burnt whilst waiting for an umbrella - it took 20 minutes in the heat of the day! We also waited over an hour to be served coffee around the pool and at the time the pool area was not busy. There was a very important group of people at the hotel - they were seated next to us for lunch at the restaurant near the pool during this time the focus was on them entirely so much so that I was given raw seabass luckily I spotted this before I ate it or else I imagine I would've been very unwell.

There are neat touches around the pools when staff bring round free plates of chilled fruit and even a man who cleans sun or reading glasses beautifully. There are several restaurants with good mixed menus on offer. The full breakfast is fabulous if a little expensive. The medina and souk is a five minute walk away  or a ¬£3 cab ride.

Around the pool was cool as they have these big loungers and hammocks with waiter service. The drinks are not cheap lots of smoking staff nice most spoke english the food was very good really enjoyed the food I would say its better to book half board as the prices looked expensive I didn't manage to get an English paper while I was there which was ok they have the New York times not much english TV the club (sol lounge) which you can go in as a guest had a great house band and good entertainment.

I have stayed there at least 3-4 times in the past but will not return because of the two things mentioned in the title of this review...    First the corridors and bedrooms almost always smell like open sewers and the hotel seems unable to remedy this problem. Second there is a trick they pull when they run an American credit card pretending to give guests the option to pay in US dollars or in Moroccan dirhams but actually obliging guests to pay in dollars at a bad exchange rate and a commission of 3%. Although the staff swore to me on check-out that I would be charged in dirhams this once again proved to be a lie (or perhaps they are just mis-informed) and my credit card company (kudos to Chase Sapphire Preferred) gave me a credit for the 11-dollar difference.    This may seem like a small amount and it is certainly not worth losing a customer's goodwill over but this customer does not like being lied to by hotel personnel. And Sofitel does not have a Customer Relations phone number -- only a clumsy e-mail procedure -- so there is no way to give them feedback directly.,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Tucson, Arizona",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/563Tom
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,MarieC89 wrote a review Mar 2014,40,"Lovely hotel, helpful staff.",Despite being slightly apprehensive about staying in such a modern hotel in marrakech I was pleasantly surprised by the Sofitel. The staff were all very helpful and were on hand to offer advice about finding our way around the city this was a nice addition to our stay as we didn't spend our limited time getting hopelessly lost. The Medina and Souks are within walking distance and the hotel are happy to arrange any form of transport you want (Petit/Grand taxi horse and carriage etc even a limo if you have the funds!) The hotel can also arrange a guide for most trips if you want local information and to be taken to where you actually want to go! Other trips that can be arranged include those outside the city into the desert. The pool area provides a great opportunity to relax from a days sightseeing/Moroccan heat. All in all a beautiful hotel (albeit a modern one) in a city known for its character. The hotel does have some traditional Moroccan touches and when you walk into the Sofitel for the first time you are instantly provided with a lovely scent of (what I think) was orange flower and jasmine.

However I am glad I read the reviews  and stress that is is very important to read these as it thoroughly prepares you. Please go with an open mind ready to embrace the Morrocan culture please leave English mentality at home. If you can't then please don't go! I was really nervous by the mixed reviews so I had no expectations however I can say we had a wonderful time and would love to go again. For further details...continue reading!    SOFITEL LOUNGE AND SPA  This is very beautiful hotel I was taken away by the interior design and prestigious location Hivernage that it is located within. The actual hotel building/facilities is definitely 5 star accreditation the staff very lovely and really fussed over my little one. But the hotel service was slightly hit and miss and slightly lacking in attention to detail. But I realised that it is part of the Moroccan culture they are very laid back people however when you do ask for something they are keen to provide. The Hotel receptionist Housna was always readily available to our needs Nafissa and Hadija kept on checking on our room comfort and made sure they corrected any mistakes I.e. Non replaced towels etc. It appears all the reviews concerning the air condition in the rooms are correct they DONT work properly. Thank God it wasn't really hot otherwise we would have suffered :( !!!  Oh and their appears to be construction work near the poolside which no review has mentioned quite surprised. This can be slightly noisy but not overbearing.    The Main assistants Omaihema (and Lamye) were so pleasant and my daughter loved them  and really worked on building a rapport with us. as well as the infamous Fatima working in the breakfast hall....amazing Woman!    PLACES TO EAT/LOCATION    Hotel is reeaaallly expensive so worthwhile eating at Hivernage Hotel and Spa (fraction of price) we did twice. For a nice (expensive treat) highly recommend So Good restaurant and Bar at the Sofitel with amazing entertainment (by Seven Senses my lil' one actually performed with them) or Pomiroeu @ The Pearl Hotel and Spa(Italian).  The hotel is located in a classy residential area with a few hotels round it...Es Saadi The Pearl etc. The medina is not to far 10min so we walked it however you also have a choice of horse and carriage ride or taxi. You can get round yourself don't mind the self-imposed tour guides who keep pestering you.  The Medina was such a wonderful experience however we went early 9ish and left before it got very busy cos of our lil' one...As they say be prepared to barter with the stall/shop keepers.    There are a few executions so ask the concierge and other hotels cafe you can go to further out.

On bringing this to the attention of the reception desk the staff immediately called the front office manager Mr Abderrahmane Benmansour who apologised profusely and moved us to another room immediately and kindly offered us free dinner and spa treatment for my wife as gesture of goodwill. He was very helpful and dealt with the matter quickly and professionally which made our stay in Sofitel very very pleasant and would most definitely revisit the hotel in the future and recommend to our friend and family.  We also found the guest relation Sarra Mouj to be very friendly and helpful in this matter and she kindly invited us to a cocktail evening in the hotel that evening. We throughly enjoyed ourselves as the atmosphere was very pleasant.  The breakfast was very good and there were lots of selection and the staff was very friendly and helpful in particular FATIMA who is definitely an asset for any organisation.

My sister was ill on the very first morning of our stay so was unable to make it for breakfast. Knowing this Fatima kindly packed a selection of pastries and cakes in a box for us to take to her. Not only that she made a soothing milk drink with a blend of special herbs and spices to help aid her upset stomach. Fatima is definately an asset to the hotel and she made our stay very pleasant.  With regards to the pool area it had a very relaxing ambiance. Would highly recommend this hotel to friends and family!,Date of stay: March 2014,,Nottingham,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/butterfly200587
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Mainwearing wrote a review Mar 2014,50,Very stylish. Great service from professional staff.,We were overnight prior to the end of our tour. A lovely hotel oozes quality from the first moment. We had a lovely room overlooking the pool/lounging area. Pity about the building work which would have marred a longer stay because the sound echoed in the room. We had breakfast and lunch both very goodalthough lunch portions were far too large. This seems to be the way in Morocco where food just keeps on coming! Would definitely recommend for a longer stay as a base to see Marakkech but see also my review of La Maison Arabe as a more traditional alternative. It's all a matter of taste.,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,Hereford,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mainwearing
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,marthaScotland wrote a review Mar 2014,30,Five star? I don't think so!,I had read mixed reviews on this hotel and decided to book a week I think I was blinded by the brand!  It is a lovely hotel on first impression but is let down on many levels.  We were transferred from the airport and the representative organised the check in which went smoothly as we drank the customary Moroccan tea.  Disappointed in the room expected more. The beds were so comfortable that was the best bit.  Seperate toilet was so small shower average. Carpet was rather grubby.  The service was mixed concierge was poor lots of staff but they didn't seem to be doing very much. Breakfast was nice enough a bit chaotic the staff are very quick to clear tables but not so hot on customer service. Water for tea is lukewarm and the coffee was average.  The restaurant was extortionateDinner for two two courses a half bottle of wine and a bottle of water ¬£100!!!  During our stay there was building works going on which was noisy most of the day. No explanation or apology for the inconvenience.  I did not use the spa charge for the pool and steam room was 2500 dirhams ridiculous considering this is almost always complimentary in any other hotel I have stayed.  If you are visiting the Sofitel brush up on your French and prepare to spend!,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,scotland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marthaScotland

Fair enough we went to the pool side restaurant service was horribly slow. We got our room at 3:30 it was not worth the wait small and overlooking the highway. Lots of cars buzzing by late or rather early into the morning.  The complimentary internet was bad breaking up and loosing connection all the time. I could only get wifi connection in the toilet!

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,andrewhaynes wrote a review Mar 2014,50,Amazing hotel great experince,Stayed for four nights at the Sofitel Marrakech we pre-booked the chaffer driver from the airport who takes you to the hotel which is 10 minute drive from the airport.    At the hotel you are greeted by friendly staff and the hotels grand reception area.  The rooms are spacious and modern (Brits as this is a French hotel do not expect tea making facilities in the room). Rooms are checked and cleaned atleast twice daily.    The breakfast buffet is fantastic with great choice of foods the hotel is located close to the clubs and bars for night life and a 10 minute walk from the market and old Marrakech making in an ideal location.    The hotel has a heated pool which is handy as the weather in feb is around 20 degrees and the heated pool is still warm.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,matyls wrote a review Mar 2014,40,Marrakech Rocks,We resided in this specific hotel towards the latter end of February . fa√ßade very imposing. Arrival overall conducted in a rather hurried fashion. The front reception staff were not exactly the epitome of embracement .Even although there appeared to be no other guests checking in at that particular time . .We were allocated a room in the lounge and spa area of the establishment .Although the room was rather exhausted in appearance .They were well appointed with the latest mod cons and the usual extravagance of toiletries    Breakfast was a sheer delight .With an array of fresh produce of the highest standard and quality. Staff in the dining area were generally all very helpful and friendly .    Recreational area ; Gardens nice with a multitude of sun bathing option. Staff were always on hand if you required towels  drinks etc .    Generically this is a lovely hotel .Situated in the affluent Hivernage area of Marrakech. Classified as a 5 star establishment coupled with excruciatingly high food and beverage prices . We took the liberty of not dining in the hotel as we calculated that a meal for 2 and a few drinks in one of the Sofitel restaurant's would set you back at least ¬£100.00 . The dining experience outside the hotel was phenomenal . A few minutes walk to the right of the hotel sees a number of top class eateries ( The Pearl hotel and Table De Marche ) which were at least half the price .    Marrakech is an overwhelming experience not to be missed .A bustling vibrant city that offers an assemblage of accommodation and dining options .Would we return to the Sofitel Marrakech . . Yes  but certainly not in a hurry . We have travelled extensively and stayed in some of the leading hotels of the world which in hindsight were less expensive compared to the Sofitel. Sadly its soaring prices may have a somewhat tarnishing effect on the individual .,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,edinburgh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matyls
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Lianecarroll wrote a review Mar 2014,50,AMAZING!!,This was a well earned 2 night whistle stop tour to Marrakech with my husband. We are both SO glad we chose this hotel. ( with British Airways Holidays ) From the moment we arrived we were treated incredibly. I had previously read every review and was prepared for the long check in etc but we were in our sumptious room within 10 minutes of arrival. We were also given a complimentary upgrade to a junior suite which was immaculate.  We booked the half board plan and every meal was delicious and very generous.  We were particularly looked after by Amine on our first night and Salah on our second night. That said EVERY member of staff were exemplary and wonderful.  ( A wonderful woman checked us in and I am ashamed I lost the card with her name on). ( I was also made pancakes by the now infamous Fatima who truly lived up to all her reviews!!!)  Also the house band Seven Senses were brilliant. Both my husband and I are professional musicians and we really appteciated their amazing talent.  We spent a very relaxed afternoon on the terrace drinking Mint tea and drinking in the heady romantic atmosphere.    Thank you Sofitel lounge and spa for an unforgettable stay.  We have discussed it and would find it very hard indeed to find a single fault.  Here's to the next visit.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Frank K wrote a review Mar 2014,10,Bad experience,I stayed at this hotel just 2 nights. The hotelroom was absolutely no value for money ( room 60). The room is equipped for invalids but I would not even recommend it for them. The curtain was partially torn the fridge did not work the toilet reservoir was leaking so it refills every 10 minutes. Every morning there was a bad smell in the bathroom. The door to the terras could not be locked ( was fixed). The connecting door made it unfortunately possible to overhear the voices in the other room. Within these 2 days 3 times a employee of the hotel entered my room without any knocking even with the do not disturb sign outside the door. I had the feeling that this room was used by the staff not expecting that a guest was using it. The staff at the reception was not very friendly and not very open to my complaints. Not a nice experience and will certainly choose another hotel next time despite the Spa that was a wonderful experience,Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled on business,Belgium,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/040560
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,reviewer3445 wrote a review Mar 2014,10,Do not even bother !!,"I would NOT recommend this hotel at all. I generally do alot of research before booking hotels as I am very particular; though this hotel received mixed reviews I liked the fact that this was a well known brand (therefore certain level of expectation would be adhered to) seemed close the souks restaurants etc...    The hotel is there to rip people off down to the hotel porters restaurant staff and concierge etc..    Our ""suite"" was located on the ground floor and had an awful stink to it (I am guessing it was located near pipes and the kitchen (possbily). Upon checking in straightaway we had issues our air conditioning wasn't working and had to call twice to get this fixed (wasting 1.5hrs!) our windows which led to the garden area and the balcony door were left open - they could not be locked. After calling maintenance they fixed this. However every day housekeeping would leave our balcony door (ground floor) open - bearing in mind that people could walk past our room and just enter in was appalling.    Out front door would not lock and even the device that locks it from the inside (door guard) did not work on three occasions the hotel staff (cleaners maintenance you name it!) just walked in whilst we were in the room with the DO NOT DISTURB sign on.    This is the most unprofessional hotel I have ever had the misfortune to stay at. In addition to this (and please be careful) the ""Concierge"" was a complete joke they would only recommend what would seem like places where they probably get a cut (money!) from. When I tried to ask them about other places that came recommended they would not enterain talking about them; they had their own agenda which made us feel very uncomfortable. They recommended the worst places to eat; in addition when we booked a hammam from a place that they recommended we had to cancel on the day (giving 2 hours notice) he went ballistic (very unprofessional) stating that I should have told him yesterday I had to explain that I cannot predict when I get ill and therefore had to cancel. I had to raise my voice and be very rude back for him to back down.    There is one particular hotel porter (I didn't get his name!) that insisted on carrying everything we had even though we would keep saying no just to get a tip. Even on our last day we walked out of the hotel and he insisted on stopping my husband to find out his room number so he could check if we checked out - UMM are you not a Hotel porter? Who the hell are you to check if we have checked out. That is our responsibility and the hotel take your card details if people just leave a hotel without checking out. ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS.    Breakfast is just full of pastries and unhealthy items (apart from yoghurt and some pasty looking fruit!). I would recommend going to the cafe (called ExtraBlatt) that is on the road in front of the hotel (past Novotel). Breakfast cost if overpriced too.    The taxis outside of the hotel are way overpriced - just walk down the road and grab a cab from there (you will cut the price by half!).    Do not get a hotel taxi from the airport; they charge 25 Euros when you can get a cab for 50 Dinars.    TO SUMMARISE - Stay at Novotel Stay in a Riad - I wouldn't bother wasting ANY money at this hotel. The only saving grace is ""So Lounge"" which has a lovely ambience and had a great band entertaining guests (Seven Senses!)    I thought Softel was 5* luxury - I would rather stay at Travellodge! I would never stay at Sofitel again.",Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reviewer3445

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,spycatcher007 wrote a review Feb 2014,20,Columbidae welcome; guests wait your turn!,"Marrakech is a wonderful place and Sofitel are generally not bad however after the initial impressions of the interesting interior in the public areas of this hotel had worn off we began to feel a great sense of disappointment and then finally anger!    I'm not sure if it was the two-hour wait for the room to be ready (at 16:00!) on arrival or the fact that we were then charged for our ""welcome"" drinks in the bar or maybe it was the smell of sewage when we finally entered the room and the grubby carpets ramshackle chest of drawers or the fact that the doors to the minibar would not close and hung permanently at ‚Äúhalf cock‚Äù.    Was it the fact that the air conditioning would neither cool nor heat? In February you need both.    Could it have been the pigeons living on the balcony that had clearly taken up residence a long time ago? I really should have photographed them nesting in between the cushions on the balcony sofa. Their ‚Äúdoings‚Äù were all over: on the table and chairs on the sofa and cushions on the balcony rail floor need I go on? Our first three days involved early start excursions so we only had a chance to complain about this on the fourth day. The mess was sort of cleaned but as I predicted said pigeons came straight back and continued where they had left off. This rendered the balcony unusable.    As others have also commented here the shower was a trickle variously hot and then cold with no way of regulating the temperature because of the low flow rate. Tip to other guests I managed to fix this. Simply unscrew the shower attachment then turn on the shower. This will expel the rubber ‚Äúfilter‚Äù which in our case was blocked by some more rubber. Screw the showerhead back and hey presto! you have a perfectly working shower.    Was it the ritual humiliation of waiting at the front of the breakfast queue whilst ""well kent"" locals were taken from behind and seated first? This happened on the two mornings when we were able to have a late breakfast (10:00 am-ish). At 07:30 it was just about possible to get a table with no waiting; at 08:00 it is already too late. On one occasion even when assigned a table and told to ‚Äúgo to the buffet whilst we clean it‚Äù we came back to find one such local had plonked her handbag there and claimed it had been there all along. It had not and the waiter told us so however paying guests seem to come last when it comes to service here.    Maybe we were disappointed by the waiting and waiting and waiting for service in any of the bars or the very limited menu in the restaurant or the lack of eating choices anywhere?    Perhaps it was the fact that having called for ‚Äúhelp with the bags‚Äù on release day nobody came so we hauled them down ourselves?    So overall impressions? Well it‚Äôs a ‚Äúno‚Äù from me I‚Äôm afraid. Not so much *****; more like **!    By the way some of the staff here are running a scheme in order to have a mention on this site handing out slips of paper with their names and the Trip Advisor URL. I did wonder why so many reviews seem to mention staff by name.",Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Elgin, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spycatcher007

We'd like to thank Fatima Rachida Karima Hosni and Bagdour for all their smiles and good humour. Great ambassadors for the hotel.

We really enjoyed the hammam room in the spa which was a lovely escape from some of the bad weather we experienced in January. The room was a good size with very comfortable beds! The location of the hotel is perfect- it is a 10 minute walk from the medina but far away enough so that you can appreciate the relaxing hotel. Very friendly and helpful staff- in particular Fatima Hicham Rachida Abderahim and Kamal who made our mornings at breakfast even more enjoyable.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,theswissmister wrote a review Feb 2014,40,"Great public areas, so-so staff, dissapointing rooms","We stayed here for about a week awhile back. Family of 3 (child age 3). Our main purpose was tourism and Marrekesh was about as ""exotic"" as we wanted go with a 3 year old in tow.    Public areas: All public areas seemed well maintained. Decoration is done quite well. It's a lovely hotel. Spaceous. Plenty of areas to sit and socialize. Outdoor lounge overlooking the 2 pools. The grounds are nicely done and well maintained. A couple of the obligatory ""luxury"" shops (Louis Vuitton a wine shop and a small clothing store?).    Babysitting: We wanted to take a few hours to do a couples spa and were pleasantly surprised to find out that they were willing to provide childcare for our daughter. While babysitting services aren't rare in luxury properties very few take children younger than 4-5. From the few moments of observation I was able to get it appeared that my daughter was kept amused and having fun.    Room: It served it's purpose but I found it a bit dissapointing. I think we had just a standard room with a king size bed. While the furnishings were decent they weren't anything to write home about. The carpet was actually loose and wavy. The heavy glass shower door was off the bottom hinge. The sink plug wouldn't go up. Sofitel is supposed to be Accor at it's best right?    Spa: The spa is nice. We took a few hours away from the daughter got a ""couples"" massage and used the facilities a bit. Better than average for hotel spa but not overly special either it's certainly worth taking a few hours to get away from it all.    Staff:  Concierge was top notch and helped quite a bit with planning (to include a nice day hike out in the Atlas mountains to include driver and guide).    Reception: Professional but not overly friendly. Mostly seemed to be suffering from the old ""Stick up the A*s"" syndrome.    Housekeeping: I can't complian here. Housekeeping was attentive. We never had to request anything that was overlooked. Turndown service is provided. Rose petal configurations on the bed and in the bathroom were a nice touch.    Tea master: I don't know what title this guy really holds but he was always friendly and willing to enter into a conversation. One of the more memorable people there.    Terrace bar: O.K. amount of seating but can get competitive at busier times. Service was always slow. I usually like to have a quick coffee and cigarette before heading out with the family. As such I'd leave the room 10 minutes before them (I don't smoke around my children)...Service was so slow that I started planning a half an hour..for a 5 minute coffee and cigarette break.    Breakfast: Good food. Fresh. Nice selection. Made to order area for eggs. Service was fine during slower periods but was a bit lacking during busier times. Option to eat on the patio is nice (should the weather permit of course).    Bar/Lounge: Nice area with a large terrace. Good for an end of the day drink.

I stayed for a few days in February 2014 with my partner.    Standards are slipping throughout.    The reception staff at Lounge and Spa are mostly young ladies arrogant and unwelcoming. If you're not proficient in French they tend to look down on you. That's not the first time I have experienced this from them. I experienced this in my previous visit. Worryingly they are generally rude and untrained. They insist on a credit card preauthorisation or cash deposit. They do not often raise a smile. They generally do not care. They do not know how to properly treat guests. I specifically remember Wafa and Fatima-Zahra being specfically rude at the Lounge and Spa reception.    No mint tea drinks snacks were offered during check-in. That was very disappointing.    Don't get my wrong on the surface the hotel is beautiful with superb objet d'art d√©cor pools and rooms. It is nicely located within the city as well. It is a short 15min/20min walk from Djema el Fna located near a Carrefour supermarket as well (ask concierge for directions).    The breakfast selection is vast but service is inconsistent. The jewel of the breakfast team is Fatima the lady who cooks and serves Moroccan cr√™pes (mssemen). She is a motherly figure and very kind caring and a special member of the team at breakfast. The majority of the young men and ladies who serve at breakfast are untrained and overwhelmed. They do not tend to the guest they must have their attention called for anything to be served such as coffee juice tea or water.    One of the pools is heated during the winter and Hicham is very kind and deserved recognition.    The rooms have superb complimentary toiletries Les Notes de Lanvin and Hermes. They are modern and comfortable. However bathtub grouting is peeling away and the lock on our door actually fell off during the stay.    Housekeeping is a deep concern.  The room was not cleaned in the evening and it was cleaned really late during the morning. Rooms need to be cleaned when the guests are at breakfast and when the sign saying 'please clean my room' is up.    Turndown service is done is 5pm when guests are trying to get ready for the evening. This is very inconvenient. It needs to be done after 7pm when guests are going out or going for dinner.    Mr Benkirane General Manager please look at:    - Training the young reception staff at the Lounge and Spa side.  - Training your servers at breakfast to provide consistent and dedicated service and not ignoring guests. They should come to guests not the other way around.  - Looking at the housekeeping situation. Turndown service is an early evening thing not late afternoon.  - You have an excellent member of staff in Fatima who cooks mssemen at breakfast. She deserves recognition.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Margaret L wrote a review Feb 2014,50,Superb hotel and service,We had a lovely week here. Hotel was friendly comfortable and atmospheric but what really made our stay was the fantastic service from every single member of staff. They were kind friendly helpful efficient - everything you could want - from early morning til late at night without fail.  Breakfast gave an amazing range of food all fresh with many items cooked as required and we grew used to seeing Fatima's lovely smile and greeting as she prepared the crepes each morning. Rachida Mourad remembered our drinks preferences the waitress Fatima carefully made sure that we lacked for nothing and her colleagues Hicham Abderahim and Benayad (the Manager) watched carefully to make sure that plates were cleared away as soon as required that fresh drinks were supplied and that whatever was needed arrived straight away. This might sound a bit overwhelming but it was all carried out in such a relaxed and friendly way that the whole experience of breakfast was a pleasure.  Although we had only booked for room and breakfast prefering the freedom to experience different restaurants we did have several meals (lunch and dinner) in the hotel. All were good and beautifully served.  All in all a great experience.,Date of stay: January 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Wolverhampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/margaretl597

The food at breakfast and in the restaurantswhich I'll review seperatly is very good.  However Check in is an absolute disaster! They can not get it right. After a long flight all I want to do is go to my room take a shower and a nap. Not wait in the hotel lobby for hours. I was told the hotel was full and no rooms were available I was told that 3pm is check in time and there is nothing we can do. I finally got my room after 4 in the afternoon.

The hotel's success is due to some of the best people working there Fatima Hicham Quanfi Hamagl Abderarim Chahira and the manager Abdelillah are to name a few! During breakfast each morning we were attended to a lady called Rachida who did her upmost to ensure we were enjoying our day both at the hotel and Marrakech. Each morning she spoke with us asking about our travel plans for the day and guiding us where possible. This was a great help and she is a true asset to the hotel she made our stay that extra bit special.    Will be returning very soon!

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,EBY_NYC wrote a review Jan 2014,30,Disappointing...,Stayed here twice. I should have known what to expect after making email inquiries to the hotel days before arriving and receiving no reply. I even called the hotel from New York to ask for help making a restaurant reservation and when I arrived they had no idea about my call or what I requested etc. Arrived late on Christmas eve. Despite being Accor Gold members the reception asked us to complete lengthy questionnaires which asked if we wanted to become Accor members (um no we are already members). No room upgrade and the junior suite we had was a bit run down considering the price we paid: woodwork that was torn out of the bathroom door frame low water pressure alternating between freezing and hot water in the shower (we asked that it be looked at and nothing appears to have been done). We had reserved a king bed and found two twin beds which they then needed to squeeze together to make into one bed. Concierge desk was a bit of a circus which made me frustrated and made me resort to self-help to get things done. When we departed the first time the manager asked about our stay and when we gave our feedback he apologized and said that he would make sure our second stay was better. The second stay was a little better (working shower this time) but we were not dazzled as we had been at other Sofitels we have stayed in (like in Aswan and Luxor for example which were amazing). I just did not feel the warm hospitality of other hotels.    Nice things I can say: housekeeping service was good. Room service was very good (food was great). The property is gorgeous with nice views. Nice location (close enough to the Medina without the chaos).

Besides the very friendly head of reception and the overwhelming breakfast few of the features are pleasant.    The worst experience was that the pool-guys put magazines on the chairs to reserve them and ""sell"" those during the day (which felt weirdly like some cheap low-class hotel in Mallorca). I spotted a few of them getting payed when they ""offered"" the chairs to guests who payed them. it's outrages that the guys make money by selling chairs at the pool. I would fire every single one of them.    The Spa is not included in the room so you have to pay extra every time you want to use the sauna or steam bath (why do they call it spa hotel?)

The hotel is really good with very nice rooms especially the beds are really good! What i really want to point out is the nice and personal service of two employees in the bar: awa one of the hostesses and said the man who is preparing the shishas in a perfect way. Very late at our last evening in this hotel i asked awa if it would be possible to buy a little bit of the wonderful shisha-tobacco and first she told me that unfortunately it's not possible. In first moment i felt really sad but what should i do. And than about 30 minutes later i got a call in my room. Awa was calling me and told me that she got a small present for me at the bar. When i went to the bar i few minutes later she and said gave me a small present with shisha-tobacco inside! I was quite happy and suprised! Really first class awa and said!! The only thing in the hotel which was a bit disappoinnting was that we stayed in this hotel for the birthday of my girlfriend and as i know it from a lot of other hotels you get a greetingscard or something like this on your room but unfortunately there was nothing.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Babul A wrote a review Dec 2013,50,Don't think about it......BOOK THIS HOTEL!!! Unbelievable! !,Let me start by saying I cannot understand why this hotel is ranked at number 204. The rest of the hotels in Marrakech must be out of this world because this hotel takes some beating. Everything about it oozes pure class.    I've stayed in Marrakech 4 times now and without a doubt this is by far the best.    Check in was smooth we were sat down and a member of staff came to us no waiting around at the desk. Special thanks to Sarra who accompanied us to our room and was extremely polite and courteous.    What sets this hotel apart from other places I've stayed in is the staff. They're all extremely friendly and always go out of their way to make sure your stay is pleasant.    Breakfast was huge so much selection and quality not to mention the decor of the actual room. Special thanks to the guys on the omelette counter nothing was too much trouble and they always asked how we wanted our eggs cooked. I didn't catch their names but they were excellent.    Special thanks to Fatima Abderahim Rachida Querfi and Redwane who all attended the to our every need. Always topping up our fresh juices and hot chocolate for my wife.    The location of the hotel is perfect set in a lovely neighbourhood - a Louis Vuitton store across the road says it all. It's a nice little 15min stroll into Jema el fena. Or if you have a lazy wife a 10dirham taxi ride which takes about 3 or 4 minutes.    Ahmed at checkout was also really polite and courteous and made sure everything was ok for our onward journey.    Me abd and my wife really couldn't find any faults the only thing that would have made it better was if the use of the pool was complimentary.    If you're thinking about booking this place then ignore the ranking my only conclusion is that it must have been poor a few years ago and the hotel has now invested in staff training as they all really are excellent ambassadors for Sofitel. Without a doubt one of the best hotels I've stayed in.    Thank you to everyone at the Sofitel.

Check in is part of the charm....no queue; but mint tea served with a smile and your details for registration presented in a folder to complete at leisure.  The only caveat is to beware of the ground floor bedroom with patio surrounded by thicket and no view. If you check in at night time you may not notice unless you inspect! It's also bang on top of the poolside cafe and adjacent to the garbage! Having refused this room immediately we then were given another room on fourth floor with superb views of pool.  Rooms are good and the bed is the type that you sink onto with a feeling of floating but also has a firm mattress; all down to a thin feather mattress cover (which I am currently tracking down as was so comfortable).  Breakfast had groaning tables of help yourself fresh fruit cold meats fresh pastries and a hot counter for your choice of eggs. An experience in itself and really no need for anything else to eat at lunchtime.....but then holidays are for indulging so why go without?  Poolside lunch can be served on your large circular bed lounger so no need to move!  Two pools and one heated for winter swimming.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Asadomento wrote a review Nov 2013,30,"Relaxing stay in Marrakech, away from the madness of Medina",We arrived at Marrakech and were immediately conned by a taxi driver for our ride to the hotel. We made the mistake of not agreeing a price with the driver. The conman pretended he didn't know English and grabbed our suitcases into his car. Once the journey was under way he said it was 180 dirham which is about 130 dirhams too much for a 15 minute journey. Make sure to agree a price with the taxi driver before boarding it. You should pay no more than 100 dirhams even though the true price is more like 50 dirhams.  The hotel itself is really nice and our standard room was adequate. However our first night was ruined by some hotel staff cleaning the tables and chairs outside our balcony with a jet washer at 1am in the morning. We spoke to the management the next day and they said that they were not meant to be cleaning at that time of night.  There's a nice heated swimming pool and the entire hotel grounds are nice as you'd expect from the 5 star property. However only the gym is free in the SPA area. Steam sauna etc. are chargeable. The prices are a bit ridiculous.  The breakfast is very French. Even though there's plenty of choice and lots of healthy options being British I missed the full English breakfast.  It's 15 minutes walk to Medina where all the madness start at dusk. You cannot walk past a stall food place or anything without getting hassled. If you take a picture they demand payment. It was all a bit too much in the end for me in the end. After experiencing the madness for couple of nights we decided to stay and relax at the hotel for the remainder of our 4 night stay. You probably don't need more than 3 days in Marrakech. Two nights would suffice.  We asked the concierge at our hotel to arrange a taxi transfer to Agadir and were quoted 220 Euros. So we declined politely and booked something for nearly half the price (115 Euros) with Taxido.net online. The Wi fi is free at the hotel and is reasonably accessible.  My lasting memory of Marrakech will unfortunately be the harassment we got in and around the Medina square area. Beggars start grabbing your arms as do the street food stall holders to pull you into their stalls. Not to mention some performers on the square demanding money because I took a picture. It was rather aggressive and I just paid them some money to get the scumbags off my back. We've been to other countries in this region (Egypt Tunisia Turkey) but never have we witnessed such incredibly aggressive behaviour by the local people. Nice is NOT a word to describe these conmen and vagabonds. I am refraining to using profanities in my review.  In conclusion I would say Sofitel hotel is a fine place to stay Marrakech is not a place I will be returning anytime soon or even my lifetime.,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CibusAmans1975

The location is great only a short walk to the medina.  There is an army of staff everywhere and thy are extremely polite and helpful.  The breakfast buffet is anything you could hope for and more.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Rory A wrote a review Nov 2013,50,Nice oasis in Marrakech,We had a wonderful time at the Sofitel Lounge and Spa. The hotel is beautiful and not far from the Medina. Its location made it easy to get to the souks and other sites in the old city. The breakfast buffet was excellent and the hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating. Especially Hicham Rachida Fatinzehera Quefi and Hakeem. The gardens and pool were lovely. When we had an issue with our room the staff fixed it immediately and came back to check to make sure everything was alright. I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay here again the next time I'm in Marrakech.,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"D√ºsseldorf, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rorya753

We typically do not stay in large upscale hotels but found the Sofitel excellent. The buffets which are usually so hum drum at most large hotels were just outstanding. The dining room decor was elegant and the choices that the food stations offered were staggering. I could not help taking photos of all of them! The service was also excellent with free WiFi and the front desk even offering to make change when we needed smaller bills and coins (a rarity we found in Morocco).

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Jonathan R wrote a review Nov 2013,30,"Much to like, a little to hate",I spent 6 nights in the Sofitel Lounge and Spa in Marrakech last week while there for conference. The fact of the matter is this hotel looks great from the lobby and public areas but the rooms are just standard hotel rooms.    Check in was a disappointment since I arrived at 3pm and my room wasn't ready until after 5pm. Considering that check out is 12pm and that check in is 3pm this is just unacceptable.    The room itself was neither a disappointment nor a surprise. Very standard size and furnishings. There was a flat panel TV but this is standard everywhere now. The Bose stereo system was a nice touch - it was easy to charge my phone and listen to my music at the same time. The workspace was adequate although the chair at the desk had no back. I would prefer an actual office chair. Nice big bathroom but still didn't have a separate bath and shower. Water pressure was terrible. Worst thing about the room was the bed. It was so horribly soft that I had serious back pain every morning. For some reason they soften it up by putting a feather comforter on the mattress. You sink into this thing like its quicksand. Horrible horrible bed. One of the worst hotel beds I have ever slept on.    The breakfast was very good - everything you could want. Coffee's pretty awful but I accept that Moroccans might like their coffee that way. I had the buffet lunch on my first day - barely ate anything was ridiculously expensive. 50 Euros for a nothing fancy buffet.    Public areas in the hotel are very nice and very fancy. Its a shame the rooms aren't renovated to reflect the opulence of the property in general.    Location is very good - its a 5 minute walk to the Medina and its also in the middle of the action in the Hivernage area.    All in all I think this is a good place for you if you want to stay in a property that feels 5 star but you don't have the big money to pay for a real 5 star hotel. It is after all significantly cheaper than other 5 star hotels in Marrakech.,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Netanya, Israel",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonorose

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Asadomento wrote a review Nov 2013,30,"Relaxing stay in Marrakech, away from the madness of Medina",We arrived at Marrakech and were immediately conned by a taxi driver for our ride to the hotel. We made the mistake of not agreeing a price with the driver. The conman pretended he didn't know English and grabbed our suitcases into his car. Once the journey was under way he said it was 180 dirham which is about 130 dirhams too much for a 15 minute journey. Make sure to agree a price with the taxi driver before boarding it. You should pay no more than 100 dirhams even though the true price is more like 50 dirhams.  The hotel itself is really nice and our standard room was adequate. However our first night was ruined by some hotel staff cleaning the tables and chairs outside our balcony with a jet washer at 1am in the morning. We spoke to the management the next day and they said that they were not meant to be cleaning at that time of night.  There's a nice heated swimming pool and the entire hotel grounds are nice as you'd expect from the 5 star property. However only the gym is free in the SPA area. Steam sauna etc. are chargeable. The prices are a bit ridiculous.  The breakfast is very French. Even though there's plenty of choice and lots of healthy options being British I missed the full English breakfast.  It's 15 minutes walk to Medina where all the madness start at dusk. You cannot walk past a stall food place or anything without getting hassled. If you take a picture they demand payment. It was all a bit too much in the end for me in the end. After experiencing the madness for couple of nights we decided to stay and relax at the hotel for the remainder of our 4 night stay. You probably don't need more than 3 days in Marrakech. Two nights would suffice.  We asked the concierge at our hotel to arrange a taxi transfer to Agadir and were quoted 220 Euros. So we declined politely and booked something for nearly half the price (115 Euros) with Taxido.net online. The Wi fi is free at the hotel and is reasonably accessible.  My lasting memory of Marrakech will unfortunately be the harassment we got in and around the Medina square area. Beggars start grabbing your arms as do the street food stall holders to pull you into their stalls. Not to mention some performers on the square demanding money because I took a picture. It was rather aggressive and I just paid them some money to get the scumbags off my back. We've been to other countries in this region (Egypt Tunisia Turkey) but never have we witnessed such incredibly aggressive behaviour by the local people. Nice is NOT a word to describe these conmen and vagabonds. I am refraining to using profanities in my review.  In conclusion I would say Sofitel hotel is a fine place to stay Marrakech is not a place I will be returning anytime soon or even my lifetime.,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CibusAmans1975

We typically do not stay in large upscale hotels but found the Sofitel excellent. The buffets which are usually so hum drum at most large hotels were just outstanding. The dining room decor was elegant and the choices that the food stations offered were staggering. I could not help taking photos of all of them! The service was also excellent with free WiFi and the front desk even offering to make change when we needed smaller bills and coins (a rarity we found in Morocco).

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Jonathan R wrote a review Nov 2013,30,"Much to like, a little to hate",I spent 6 nights in the Sofitel Lounge and Spa in Marrakech last week while there for conference. The fact of the matter is this hotel looks great from the lobby and public areas but the rooms are just standard hotel rooms.    Check in was a disappointment since I arrived at 3pm and my room wasn't ready until after 5pm. Considering that check out is 12pm and that check in is 3pm this is just unacceptable.    The room itself was neither a disappointment nor a surprise. Very standard size and furnishings. There was a flat panel TV but this is standard everywhere now. The Bose stereo system was a nice touch - it was easy to charge my phone and listen to my music at the same time. The workspace was adequate although the chair at the desk had no back. I would prefer an actual office chair. Nice big bathroom but still didn't have a separate bath and shower. Water pressure was terrible. Worst thing about the room was the bed. It was so horribly soft that I had serious back pain every morning. For some reason they soften it up by putting a feather comforter on the mattress. You sink into this thing like its quicksand. Horrible horrible bed. One of the worst hotel beds I have ever slept on.    The breakfast was very good - everything you could want. Coffee's pretty awful but I accept that Moroccans might like their coffee that way. I had the buffet lunch on my first day - barely ate anything was ridiculously expensive. 50 Euros for a nothing fancy buffet.    Public areas in the hotel are very nice and very fancy. Its a shame the rooms aren't renovated to reflect the opulence of the property in general.    Location is very good - its a 5 minute walk to the Medina and its also in the middle of the action in the Hivernage area.    All in all I think this is a good place for you if you want to stay in a property that feels 5 star but you don't have the big money to pay for a real 5 star hotel. It is after all significantly cheaper than other 5 star hotels in Marrakech.,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Netanya, Israel",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonorose

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Asadomento wrote a review Nov 2013,30,"Relaxing stay in Marrakech, away from the madness of Medina",We arrived at Marrakech and were immediately conned by a taxi driver for our ride to the hotel. We made the mistake of not agreeing a price with the driver. The conman pretended he didn't know English and grabbed our suitcases into his car. Once the journey was under way he said it was 180 dirham which is about 130 dirhams too much for a 15 minute journey. Make sure to agree a price with the taxi driver before boarding it. You should pay no more than 100 dirhams even though the true price is more like 50 dirhams.  The hotel itself is really nice and our standard room was adequate. However our first night was ruined by some hotel staff cleaning the tables and chairs outside our balcony with a jet washer at 1am in the morning. We spoke to the management the next day and they said that they were not meant to be cleaning at that time of night.  There's a nice heated swimming pool and the entire hotel grounds are nice as you'd expect from the 5 star property. However only the gym is free in the SPA area. Steam sauna etc. are chargeable. The prices are a bit ridiculous.  The breakfast is very French. Even though there's plenty of choice and lots of healthy options being British I missed the full English breakfast.  It's 15 minutes walk to Medina where all the madness start at dusk. You cannot walk past a stall food place or anything without getting hassled. If you take a picture they demand payment. It was all a bit too much in the end for me in the end. After experiencing the madness for couple of nights we decided to stay and relax at the hotel for the remainder of our 4 night stay. You probably don't need more than 3 days in Marrakech. Two nights would suffice.  We asked the concierge at our hotel to arrange a taxi transfer to Agadir and were quoted 220 Euros. So we declined politely and booked something for nearly half the price (115 Euros) with Taxido.net online. The Wi fi is free at the hotel and is reasonably accessible.  My lasting memory of Marrakech will unfortunately be the harassment we got in and around the Medina square area. Beggars start grabbing your arms as do the street food stall holders to pull you into their stalls. Not to mention some performers on the square demanding money because I took a picture. It was rather aggressive and I just paid them some money to get the scumbags off my back. We've been to other countries in this region (Egypt Tunisia Turkey) but never have we witnessed such incredibly aggressive behaviour by the local people. Nice is NOT a word to describe these conmen and vagabonds. I am refraining to using profanities in my review.  In conclusion I would say Sofitel hotel is a fine place to stay Marrakech is not a place I will be returning anytime soon or even my lifetime.,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CibusAmans1975

After the hustle and bustle of the souks it was really quite lovely to wander back to this little oasis. The pool area is gorgeous plenty of day beds to lounge on. Standard rooms are a decent size and with a lovely balcony.  Breakfast is a treat seriously good.  The service isn't bad but on Moroccan time.  The Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial shares the same common areas and pool but the accommodation in the Sofitel Lounge and spa is much better.,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Melbourne, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nikkimax

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Jonathan R wrote a review Nov 2013,30,"Much to like, a little to hate",I spent 6 nights in the Sofitel Lounge and Spa in Marrakech last week while there for conference. The fact of the matter is this hotel looks great from the lobby and public areas but the rooms are just standard hotel rooms.    Check in was a disappointment since I arrived at 3pm and my room wasn't ready until after 5pm. Considering that check out is 12pm and that check in is 3pm this is just unacceptable.    The room itself was neither a disappointment nor a surprise. Very standard size and furnishings. There was a flat panel TV but this is standard everywhere now. The Bose stereo system was a nice touch - it was easy to charge my phone and listen to my music at the same time. The workspace was adequate although the chair at the desk had no back. I would prefer an actual office chair. Nice big bathroom but still didn't have a separate bath and shower. Water pressure was terrible. Worst thing about the room was the bed. It was so horribly soft that I had serious back pain every morning. For some reason they soften it up by putting a feather comforter on the mattress. You sink into this thing like its quicksand. Horrible horrible bed. One of the worst hotel beds I have ever slept on.    The breakfast was very good - everything you could want. Coffee's pretty awful but I accept that Moroccans might like their coffee that way. I had the buffet lunch on my first day - barely ate anything was ridiculously expensive. 50 Euros for a nothing fancy buffet.    Public areas in the hotel are very nice and very fancy. Its a shame the rooms aren't renovated to reflect the opulence of the property in general.    Location is very good - its a 5 minute walk to the Medina and its also in the middle of the action in the Hivernage area.    All in all I think this is a good place for you if you want to stay in a property that feels 5 star but you don't have the big money to pay for a real 5 star hotel. It is after all significantly cheaper than other 5 star hotels in Marrakech.,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Netanya, Israel",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonorose

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Asadomento wrote a review Nov 2013,30,"Relaxing stay in Marrakech, away from the madness of Medina",We arrived at Marrakech and were immediately conned by a taxi driver for our ride to the hotel. We made the mistake of not agreeing a price with the driver. The conman pretended he didn't know English and grabbed our suitcases into his car. Once the journey was under way he said it was 180 dirham which is about 130 dirhams too much for a 15 minute journey. Make sure to agree a price with the taxi driver before boarding it. You should pay no more than 100 dirhams even though the true price is more like 50 dirhams.  The hotel itself is really nice and our standard room was adequate. However our first night was ruined by some hotel staff cleaning the tables and chairs outside our balcony with a jet washer at 1am in the morning. We spoke to the management the next day and they said that they were not meant to be cleaning at that time of night.  There's a nice heated swimming pool and the entire hotel grounds are nice as you'd expect from the 5 star property. However only the gym is free in the SPA area. Steam sauna etc. are chargeable. The prices are a bit ridiculous.  The breakfast is very French. Even though there's plenty of choice and lots of healthy options being British I missed the full English breakfast.  It's 15 minutes walk to Medina where all the madness start at dusk. You cannot walk past a stall food place or anything without getting hassled. If you take a picture they demand payment. It was all a bit too much in the end for me in the end. After experiencing the madness for couple of nights we decided to stay and relax at the hotel for the remainder of our 4 night stay. You probably don't need more than 3 days in Marrakech. Two nights would suffice.  We asked the concierge at our hotel to arrange a taxi transfer to Agadir and were quoted 220 Euros. So we declined politely and booked something for nearly half the price (115 Euros) with Taxido.net online. The Wi fi is free at the hotel and is reasonably accessible.  My lasting memory of Marrakech will unfortunately be the harassment we got in and around the Medina square area. Beggars start grabbing your arms as do the street food stall holders to pull you into their stalls. Not to mention some performers on the square demanding money because I took a picture. It was rather aggressive and I just paid them some money to get the scumbags off my back. We've been to other countries in this region (Egypt Tunisia Turkey) but never have we witnessed such incredibly aggressive behaviour by the local people.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,nikki_lovell wrote a review Jun 2013,50,Top Luxury Impeccable Service,Another amazing stay at Sofitel Marrakesh.. Why do I go back because the hotel is as luxurious as it looks in the pictures and Im fussy ! I like 5 star to be 5 star and the Sofitel is exactly that.. The pool view rooms are lovely and the junior suites offer the extra room space. The Imperial Palace is traditional while the Lounge & Spa has a modern take on the d√©cor. The service in this hotel is impeccable a GENUINE smile and greeting from everyone from the Manager of the hotel restaurant staff pool staff concierge who recommends the restaurants suitable for what you want to eat that night.. to the Guest Relations Manager - Soufiane who made our stay memorable who couldn't do enough to make our holiday a great experience always going the extra mile for guests whether first time or returning guests .Youness the outside Guest Manager who always had smile for every guest around the pool poolside restaurant. nothing was too much trouble he also recommended the perfect restaurant !

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Admac1 wrote a review Jun 2013,50,The great service experience,Lovely hotel . The most attentive and polite helpful staff I have encountered for a long time. The odd room could do with a repaint and the shower pressure could be better . And if you get a room facing the pond take ear plugs for the nights because the morrocan frogs are so loud it's unbelievable . Maybe that's only in June or mating season or something. Overall great value for money and very enjoyable,Date of stay: June 2013,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Admac1
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Calum T wrote a review Jun 2013,50,Everything a hotel should be.,Had a wonderful two weeks at the Sofitel Marrakech. Decor facilities food staff and ambience were all excellent. The flowers and decor in the reception and lounge areas were breath-taking. There is a real feeling of luxury in this hotel which is very well-situated for walks into the city centre. The staff seemed highly-trained and motivated to give the best possible service. If I could afford it again I wouldn't hesitate to return. If you can afford it I don't think you could choose better for your Moroccan trip.,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CalumT_13

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Dave55Bolton wrote a review May 2013,40,Good for a short break,Enjoyed our stay two weeks ago and overall the hotel was up to our expectations based on previous reports.i would try to get a pool view room as we had a mountain view and so sitting on the balcony was not an option due to the road noise. The room was fine but not quite five star compared to other hotels we have stayed in.Breakfast selection very good and food in general was very good. Service fine but around the pool area could be slow. Hotel was busy when we went and so getting a sunbed could be hard work at times as some people put towels on in the morning but then went down town for several hours. I think the price of drinks was over the top and you are a captive audience so be prepared to pay five pounds for a small bottle of beer and ten pounds for a Gin and Tonic. I think the overall impression when you arrive is very good but I think depending which room you get will be the difference in your overall score.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,travel_bug_cee wrote a review Mar 2013,10,Pool day TOTAL rip off and were made to feel unwanted.,We chose to stay in a riad to experience some character and the real Marrakech. Having visited the Sofitel for an over-priced pool day we were so glad we did just that! We were told we were not allowed to sit at the tables at the pool-side bar for lunch and had to have it brought to our sun loungers. Having paid ¬£60 for usage of the pool area for the day and a further ¬£44 for a bottle of water chicken panini coke zero and a small cheese pizza and to not be able to sit at a table to eat is ridiculous! Considering the price of the food one would expect it to be magnificent however it was TERRIBLE. The waiter was very standoffish towards us. If they don't want people who are not staying overnight at the hotel to use the pool area then they shouldn't advertise it.,Date of stay: March 2013,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travel_bug_cee
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,boendoes wrote a review Mar 2013,20,"Great Lobby, Poor Rooms","My wife and I stayed for two nights in the hotel on a recent business trip to Morocco. Although the entrance swimming pool area dining area etc creates a great impression one would expect much more from the rooms and staff. I heard the spa was great and looks impressive but we did not make use of their services due to time constrains.    Our room was in the ""new"" part of the hotel but the overall quality of the room was poor actually it was ""scruffy"" and rather something one would expect from a two star hotel. Many of the fittings in the bathroom (the shower head the mechanism which should open and close the run-off water from the bath) were broken carpets were dirty the room smelly and the toilet (separate from the bathroom) smelled like raw sewerage. The ceiling in the bathroom also was in seriously bad shape. I suggest that this hotel review their cleaning and maintenance schedules and procedures to ensure that one receives a fresh clean and properly maintained room.    Our room had a balcony but the view was onto a rubbish dump.    Although we arrived at 2pm our rooms were not ready and only got access to our rooms after 5pm. The staff generally was not very helpful or friendly and continued to serve me in French knowing that I (unfortunately) cannot speak French.    I will not recommend this hotel and suggest travelers look for alternatives in the same price class.",Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Bloemfontein, South Africa",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/boendoes

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,craig watson wrote a review Mar 2013,40,Relaxing break,Travelled with my wife for a weeks break in March.    After a 20 minute check in process we were given room 062 ground floor looking onto a temporary fish pond in the gardens. This from is very dark and the temporary pond has a time controlled fountain due to it being full of fish from the pond being renovated. We asked right away to move room and were told to come back in the morning which I did to be told to come back in an hour. 4 times this happened during the morning/afternoon until I just waited at reception until the receptionist got the message I wasn't moving from there. This got us moved to another room. Now I didn't just ask to be moved I offered to pay an upgrade to get a room move but as I asked in English the request was not received so favourably.    The new room was as we had expected the rooms to be in this hotel.    The pool area is very well appointed indeed small cabana type areas and in general large bed like areas for sunbathing which are very comfortable.    We ate in the breakfast room restaurant upstairs pool bar and SO lounge. Breakfast we found to be disappointing by being a bit hit or miss over the seating and service choice is good unless you are looking for hot choices.    The other restaurants have good food but are limited in choices and are horrendously overpriced.    Biggest issue we had was that if you wanted to have a drink in the evening there was nowhere you could do this and not be crowded out by smokers. All of the bars public areas and some of the restaurants allow smoking come on you are a 5 star hotel surely one inside bar could be non smoking?    Hotel is in a good area 5 minute walk from the walled city and 20 from the new quarter. A few bars/cafes/restaurants within a few minutes walk that have more choice better quality and are half the price but not fair to mention them in this review.    All in all a good break but could so easily be improved by a non smoking bar and a little more consideration to the non French speaking independent travellers.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Falkirk, Scotland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craigwatson

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,PAH810 wrote a review Mar 2013,40,Weekend break,Stayed here recently for a weekend break. We didn't get off to a good start as the receptionist refused to acknowledge the room up-grade promised by our travel agent. It took until the next day to resolve the issue and we were finally moved to another room (after being asked to sit and wait for nearly an hour) - requesting to see the general manage r eventually got things moving. The hotel itself was of a good standard and the staff friendly and welcoming. The food was also good - an extensive breakfast menu and a good lunch buffet. We dined one night at the Orangerie restaurant and again found the menu to be varied and interesting. Our only criticism is that the food is expensive and the choice of venues to eat in the evening is quite limited. The service in the restaurants was variable - despite the presence of many staff they failed to clear tables in a timely way and we had to ask 3 times for tea and coffee! The pool facilities were good and we used the spa which was great and offered a very good discount. The hotel is well located and not too far from the medina and main tourist attractions. Overall this was a good choice for a short break.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Beaumaris, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PAH810

We arrived late but check in was smooth and we were quickly in our room.The room was fine with comfortable bedsgood size bathroom and powerful shower although may be a bit dated. The pool area is excellent with lots of comfortable double & single sun loungers we never had a problem getting a place. We had breakfast each morning on the terrace which was brilliant with great service and an excellent choice. we found the service throughout to be very good and very friendly despite the demands of some guests. The only slight issue we had at the hotel was the price of both drinks and food which we found to be expensive so we ventured to the extrablatt cafe a two minute walk away which was ideal for coffee and snacks.  The hotel is within easy walking distance of the madness of the medina a real experience and suggest everyone visit both during the day and at night good luck crossing the roads and with the friendly locals who suddenly become guides that want paying.  There are plenty of taxis available outside the hotel but make sure you agree your fair up front as they will try it on. Try a ride in one of the petit taxis for an experience they are shall I say less luxurious!!!.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Matthew F wrote a review Feb 2013,50,Lovely,I stayed at the Sofitel Lounge and Spa in September and I could not have been happier with my choice.    I was travelling alone and as this was my first visit to Marrakech I wanted to make sure that I stayed somewhere close to the hustle of the medina but also removed enough that if I wanted a quiet day to relax by the pool I could do that as well.    The hotel is conveniently located in Hivernage and a short walk from the gates of the medina. It is situated in its own grounds and has two lovely pools. Upon arriving at Marrakech airport I was met by the hotel limo and driven directly to the hotel where I was greeted by the guest services manager. As I arrived slightly earlier than standard check in time I was shown around the hotel and facilities and invited to relax by the pool while my room was being prepared.    The room itself was spacious with a HUGE bed and decorated in a Moroccan style. The bathroom was big as well and very clean.    The pools are lovely and the perfect place to chill out. Make sure you get there early though as it can get quite busy and you might have to get a lounger further away from the pool.    The hotel also boasts a number of restaurants and a nightclub. The food is of a good standard and not overly expensive. I was also lucky enough to be invited to a private event hosted in the night club with a special guest of honor...whom I met. All done very well and I greatly enjoyed the night.    All in all the hotel was very good what you'd expect from an international chain such as Sofitel and the staff were very attentive. If you are travelling to Marrakech for the first time I would recommend this hotel.,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matthewfF8374LL

The rooms are large and comfortable with big balconies and the facilities are excellent. Pool heated to 30 deg for winter bathing. The best aspect though was the friendly and attentive staff. We had dim lighting in our room and when we commented on this they put in additional lighting within the hour. My wife had a birthday during our stay and the hotel provided roses a birthday cake and a tray of goodies. Excellent buffet breakfasts. Can't compliment them too highly. The only reason I do not rate them 5 star is the exorbitant cost of the spa. But you can find alternative facilities down town at half the price.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Smiley-Caz wrote a review Jan 2013,40,Nearly a 5 star stay,There are plenty of reviews for this Hotel so I will try and not repeat everything that many of the other reviews mention.    We felt the hotel looked very impressive on arrival and passing through the different areas of the hotel they are all beautifully furnished and the pool area was the best of any hotel we have staid in.    We found the vast majority of staff to be helpful pleasant and they went out of their way to acknowledge you. Our room was nice although on arrival the electrics weren't working and it took a while to sort it out. The bed was as we have always found a Sofitel amazing and I had slept very well. If you are a light sleeper you may want to take ear plugs other wise you will be woken up early by the prayer calls from the nearby mosque.    We found the breakfast to be great with a wide variety of choice particularly fresh fruit / smoothie wise. However if you are going looking for a full english type of experience you will be disappointed (we weren't).    We felt the location of the Hotel was fine. I would describe the area it is in as a hotel type district and there are many other 4 and 5 star hotels in the area. The district to me felt relatively new so if you are looking to experience some of the historic side of Marrakech through where you are staying its probably not for you. It is about a 10 - 15 minute walk to the main square or there are always taxis and horse drawn carriages waiting outside. We experienced very little hassle on leaving the hotel by the main entrance. The Concierge directed us to a cafe just a couple of minutes walk from the hotel called Cafe Blatt that we found to be great for a snack.    As to why I haven't given the hotel a 5 rating? There are a couple of reasons...    Because the hotel is a 5 - star I think we went with very high expectations and these weren't quite met. For example some of the corridor stairs and lift areas were a bit grubby. I also felt the bathroom was a bit of a let down. It was badly grouted the shower although worked fine had bits missing and the bathroom felt quite basic. All perfectly useable but for a 5 star I think we were looking for a bit more.    There were obviously some wealthy people staying at the hotel where as for us the break was a bit of a treat therefore we found the food and drink in the Hotel to be very expensive. I fully appreciate and accept that this is what you should expect in a 5 star hotel but we felt uncomfortable paying around ¬£6 for a can of coca cola and around ¬£8.50 for a small beer in the bar.    In summary we enjoyed our stay at the Sofitel and our holiday in Marrakech.,Date of stay: January 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Sheffield,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Smiley-Caz

We stayed here in January for 5 nights. From the moment you walk in you are welcomed by the lovely and attentive staff which give you a very warm feeling about this place. The pool area is one of the most beautiful ones that I have ever seen the whole layout is extraordinary. The whole hotel is so clean and has a very fresh smell throughout. We stayed in a Junior Suite with a breathtaking view of the Atlas Mountains. Our suite was a good size and beautiful throughout. Everytime we got back to our room it was always cleaned for us in the morning and in the evening. Housekeeping did a wonderful job and paid attention to every detail.    The Breakfast buffet was one of the best I have ever had. Do not miss that! There is a very wide and large selection of juices fruits pastries breads cereals egg station the whole breakfast is just amazing!    The spa is so calm and relaxing.

Also to Othman the Assistant Front Office Manager who was always willing to help us and go out of his way to make us feel welcome. The hospitality given by the staff is so wonderful and I cannot thank you enough as to how much more special you made our stay with your warm gestures and finishing touches to add to my husband's special day.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,25to30 wrote a review Jan 2013,40,Very family friendly but be warned the extras are very expensive,Stayed in January 2013 and was our first holiday overseas with our baby. If we had been nervous before hand there was no need as the hotel were very welcoming to our young family.    The hotel staff were incredibly welcoming and made a superstar of our son from the doormen to the cleaning staff. At breakfast everyday the waiting staff made a huge fuss of him and even kept him entertained one day so we could eat our breakfast together - a very nice thoughtful touch. Once the housekeeping staff realised our baby was a boy they changed the cot bedding to be for a little boy and left extra baby products in the room even checking what size nappy he took before leaving extras.    Breakfast everyday is fantastic - excellent large and varied selection (definitely try the moroccan pancakes with honey) all beautifully displayed and with incredibly attentive service (bringing you a basket of pastries and breads unprompted getting smoothies made up for you etc) even when breakfast is heaving at the weekend.    The outside of the hotel and communal areas are stunning with lovely fresh floral smells wafting in from the terraces. The pool area is large and the heated pool was lovely in January. There are lots of loungers and lovely day beds next to the pool fantastic place to hang out after your feet are tired from the souks. The bed in the room was very comfortable.    The hotel is about 15mins walk from the main square but very straight forward to walk and if you prefer there are taxis and horse drawn carriages outside to take you to the city centre. The calm of the hotel though is a nice break after a day in the mania of Marrakech.    The negatives.............  - The price of anything outside of the room booking e.g. dinner in restaurant room service drinks at the bar (a coke is 50dm (c¬£3.50 a can ) at the pool with a beer a similar price). It is a shame as if the prices were more reasonable then you would probably order more but we just went to the local supermarket (carrefour) instead which is about 15min walk away.  - No kettle or tea and coffee in the room (maybe this is a british thing). They did bring a kettle when we asked though.  - The air con didn't work in our room either (agreement with our tripadvisor reviews). We chose not to complain as moving rooms with a baby was too much hassle and manageable in January climate although imagine not so in the summer heat.  - The check in process was slow felt like a lot of paperwork to fill in. They kept insisting we had paid with an Amex card which they needed for our reservation. We don't own an Amex card and had booked through British Airways so this was just a bit of unnecessary hassle particularly when the room had already been paid for in full.  - Concergie slightly grumpy about helping us when a trip we had booked didn't arrive as we hadn't used the hotel provider,Date of stay: January 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Winchester, UK",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/25to30

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Ross B wrote a review Jan 2013,30,Very nice hotel - let down by staff,Stayed here May 2012 with my girlfriend for 4 nights.  The hotel itself is very nice well kept clean and well furnished. The pool area is one of the nicest I have stayed at with beds for sunbeds! Made some of the hotels in Vegas I've stayed at look ordinary!  The location is good for walking into the town and I would recommend doing this at night rather then eating in the hotel. The prices for drinks food etc. in the hotel is very expensive compared to even top London hotels but you can eat or drink in the town for a fraction of the price so as long as you are aware of this you should be ok.  We just found the staff a bit rude and unhelpful. We were supposed to stay in the newer spa part of the hotel but despite a very nice roomthe air-con was not working (not much fun in 40 degree heat!). After being told it was the whole hotel that had a problem. After not sleeping for the night because of the heat we found out from other couples that they had been told the same but after complaining been moved to rooms that did have working air-con. Cue a whole day spent arguing with the unhelpful staff and 2 rooms later got a lesser room that was at least cool. A real shame that we will remember our trip by this wasted day!  The annoying thing is that I had read on trip advisor about this exact same problem from others and just dismissed it as people moaning about a one-off problem that would be fixed.  I could go on about the bad staff (having to ask more than once for everything being ignored at breakfast ordering drinks that didn't arrive being accused of getting too much change when I ordered a drink passed from staff member to staff member slow check-in etc) but you get the picture!  Personally if I visit Marrakech again I will try somewhere else - there are lots of nice hotels nearby that I'm sure value there guests a bit more!,Date of stay: May 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Thame, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RossB156

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Alan_abc123 wrote a review Jan 2013,50,Excellent hotel in the heart of Marrakech,We booked 4 nights in Marrakech and stayed in the Sofitel Lounge and Spa hotel. When you arrive for the first time the entrance is very grand and beautiful. There are two receptions one is Moroccan style and the other is modern contemporary.. both very special. The staff were great and the food and pool area were perfect! We visited the bars also and they were very swish!  The hotel is also in a good location and walking distance to the city.  The room we got though I would say was average it was almost like the whole hotel was 5 stars but the room was 3 stars. It was clean and everything but didn't have the grandeur compared with the rest of everything else!,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alan_abc123

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,The Eating Elephant wrote a review Jan 2013,40,"A fantastic hotel, ideal for a relaxing break",Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this Sofitel during December. Having read some previous reviews I was slightly apprehensive but our room was spacious immaculate and had fantastic views. The hotel was spotless and the staff were particularly accommodating especially El Moktar at the pool bar who looked after us well during our stay. The hotel is well located a 15 minute walk to the square where we ate on several occasions. I'd also recommend the open roof Skybar at the Delano Hotel directly opposite - good menu if you like sushi though we just popped over for a gin and tonic most evenings and the staff extremely attentive. Overall a great trip thanks to the high standards of the accommodation and service and an added bonus that it is such a short transfer from the airport. I'd also like to recommend 4x4 Camel which can be found on this site if you'd like a day trip ..... a hassle free way to get out and about and see the stunning Atlas Mountains.

While looking for the club we past the Sofitel Marrakech Lounge and Spa and decided to ask the guard. He directly asked a couple of taxi drivers but since they didn¬¥t know it either he advised us to go to the reception of the Sofitel.    Before we could get to the reception another employee already asked us if he could help us. We said yes and fortunately he could answer our question. After a couple of days in Marrakesh it was great to find out that people (in this case employees of a five star hotel) were still willing to help you without expecting money.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,everybodyreach wrote a review Dec 2012,50,"Exquisite common areas, genuine Moroccon hospitality, average location.",A website error allowed me to book this hotel for $25/night so naturally I took the opportunity. I generally like Accor hotels and this Sofitel was quite lovely. The common areas the pool bars restaurants & spa were beautiful. Lots of staff who were very friendly & polite. The room which was very far from the reception was fine though it had seen better days & was becoming tired. It looked out onto a Louis Vuitton store so if you find yourself there ask to change. There was actually a lot of noise from a neighbouring bar & at 4am lots of talking outside in the street. I think this had something to do with the call to prayer. I would definitely bring ear plugs.  Breakfast was typical 5* offering hotel about 15 mins walk to main square or new part of town. Don't be fooled by taxi drivers telling you it's fixed price of 100D to the airport. Just walk away no matter how much they protest. I got one for 50 about 20m down the street.  If I'd had to pay $300 for this place I wouldn't have felt I'd got real value as I'm sure there are charming local hotels at a fraction of the price but of course for what I paid I was more than happy.,Date of stay: December 2012,,australia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/everybodyreach

The main problem was the the room had a very strong mildewy smell. The staff sprayed mint water on the floor to fresh it up and I left the balcony doors open whenever I was there but the smell just permeated the room. I couldn't move because of the film festival so the huge hotel was booked solid! My colleagues didn't seem to have this problem in their room. Also the espresso maker was very difficult to work and they didn't replace the pods. I know others that had a hard time working that fancy machine.

Every fruit imaginable freshly cooked omelettes as well as full English freshly cooked crepes full continental and every bread you can imagine. The staff ratio about 5 to 1 guest are so polite courtious and charming. It is not cheap about UK prices for drinks etc but then again it is a 5 star hotel.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Vestfoldgirl wrote a review Nov 2012,40,Friendly staff and beautiful common areas,The hotel is located outside the Medina about 20 minute walk to the main square Jemaa el fnaa.    The hotel has a beautiful exterior and reception area. Very beautiful art on display. Nice arabic perfume smell inside the hotel. Check- in took some time as we had to fill in some forms but we were offered washcloths juice and delicious macaroons while going through the ordeal.    We were a little disappointed with the room which did not quite add up to the otherwise beautiful lobby gardens and restaurant areas. The room was more four star and it was bit dated. It also felt a bit cramped. We had booked king size bed but was given to single beds that where put next to each other not as comfy as a kingsize bed. The lighting is not so good in the room at least not if you want to read. There is a safe a minibar bath tub and nice bathroom soaps from L√íccitane. The room was clean. We never experience any turn down service even though we were informed that this was provided.    Breakfast was nice and plentiful. Eggs to order crepes cold cuts pastries smoothie station etc. You can its outside or inside and the decor is very nice. We had lunch at the pool restaurant one day. Not so exciting menu your basic sandwiches salads and hamburgers. We had dinner in the room one night. I had the lemon chicken tagine and I did not like it....    The staff was very friendly courteous and professional without exception!    We spent only a couple of hours by the pool the pool beds are very comfortable. They had some weird entertainment by the pool with 3 guitar playing and singing men was walking around playing old hits. It was strange......    If you want something to eat between 5 and 7 in the afternoon it seems the only option was room service or to find a restaurant in the neighborhood maybe as nothing was open in the restaurant. The hotel is in a very quiet are with mostly other upscale hotels and a few restaurants and some upscale shops (i.e Louis Vuitton) so if you want some action you will have to go to the Medina.    The staff will address you in french but they do speak english.    Check-out went smoothly. Can be recommended if you like big hotels though I am sure staying in a riad would have been a lot more charming.,Date of stay: November 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sandefjord, Norway",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vestfoldgirl

I stayed In Marrakech with my familly the first days of January. In the evening and in the morning you will feel a little cold which disappears during the sunny day. Soffitel is really a great hotel. Very impressive whan you arrive. Huge and very cozy lobby with fresh mint tea friendly staff at reception will convince you that you're in the right place. The rooms are large enough with a terrace overlooking the Atlas Mountains. Heated outdoor pool excellent service at the pool as well enough sun to make you look for shadow under the umbrellas. The guys on the pool will keep your place for the next day. Small tip. Breakfast is excellent. Spa very good.. Night club with live music is the right place for relaxation. Near the hotel there are several excellent restaurants of different international cuisines. Mmmmmm !!! Fair price. Ask Concierge necessarily. Nice guys. My suggestion is to take a local guide who will show you everything worth seeing in Marrakech. It's very cheap. In Medina you will find a lot of nice things for the house. Price is different depend what you want to buy and what quality you choose. You should to haggle it's part of their tradition.

Later we found 10 bad faults with our rooms definitely not 5 Star would not put up with them in a 3 star hotel. We went down to reception asked to speak to the Manager told him the faults and that if they could not give us the standard of room we expected we would go to another hotel.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Maurizio wrote a review Oct 2012,30,Good hotel with some bad points..,I stayed at this hotel this summer for a week with my girlfriend. We were undecided which hotel to stay at in Marrakech but after having the Sofitel recommended by some Moroccan friends and after looking at pictures and reviews we decided to book here.    The rate I got through my credit card company was surprisingly cheap (I can't remember exactly the price but it was around 160EUR per night breakfast included and special rates at the spa).    The first impression of the hotel was good as we were greeted warmly and the place looked very nice and well kept. Although we had to wait quite a long time to check in we were offered tea and local sweets during our wait.    The room was large although not very modern and not very clean: on my arrival I noticed that the rubbish bin was still partly full and there was an empty bottle of coke on the balcony. This really upset me as the main thing I care about when staying at a hotel is cleanness and hygiene.    The pool area was nice and relaxing an the service was prompt and attentive. Also the spa was good and there was a wide choice of massages.    The food at the hotel was overall good but not exceptional. I enjoyed the breakfast because of the very wide choice of sweets pastries fruits and hot food.    The concierge was at times arrogant and it felt like that he had some interest in the restaurants that he was recommending to us as some of them felt like tourist traps..    The So club was actually very fun probably the best night club in Marrakech.    Overall the hotel was good.. not exceptional but good.. I'd recommend the Sofitel to young people or couples who don't want to stay at a very posh hotel (La Mamounia) which would be more appropriate for older people but who still want to have the comfort of a 5stars hotel.  Would I stay here again? Probably I would try out other ones..,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Paris,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaurizioD527

I have travelled widely stayed in many wonderful 5* hotels but have to say this is probably one of the best. From the moment we arrived the staff proved to be courteous helpful and made one feel nothing was too much trouble.  On arrival at the hotel the local rep who met us at the airport tried to convince us that we had been upgraded to a superior room with pool view. On pointing out that this was in fact what had been booked anyway he became somewhat flustered and back peddled - I have read elsewhere that this has been the experience of other guests. In fact this tactic was quite unnecessary as the whole hotel is a delight and facilities are of an extremely high standard anyway.  Breakfast is an absolute joy and one could take all morning over it. The staff moved in and out of each other seamlessly noticing each and every used plate or glass. They remain friendly yet very professional and discreet - the best waiting-on at table I have ever encountered. Great choice of food and as much as one can possibly eat so keeps one going until the afternoon.  We didn't eat in any of the restaurants mainly due to preference to sample local restaurants but menus looked wonderful if rather pricey!  The room we had was on the 2nd floor and views were rather obscured by olive trees growing outside so a higher floor might be better. The bedroom and bathrooms are very relaxing and comfortable and most wonderful of all the room has a loo separate from the bathroom - great when sharing facilities.  Vast reception areas well kept gardens and fantastic garden lighting made this a fabulous refuge and escape from the chaos that is Marrakech.,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,england,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/feta

The public rooms are so welcoming and intriguing that it is almost an effort to go outside into the sunshine. Guest rooms are spacious and well equipped and comfortable. A bed to get lost in. Room service provides a varied selection of pillows.  Gardens and pools are delightful and inviting. A serenity almost to match The Chedi in Muscat.  Food. Excellent choices. The Oasis by the pool provides daytime delights and is quite reasonable. L'Orangerie in the evening has an excellent choice of food and wines. Service is what I have come to expect from Sofitel. Caution. On darker evenings a 'romantic' table on the Terrace of L'Orangerie throws up a problem. The candles are quite inadequate to read the menu!

The bedrooms were large and nicely furnished - the beds were SO comfortable! We were a group of eight and all of us commented on how fabulous the beds were! The bathrooms were large with lovely toiletries robes and slippers. Breakfast offered plenty of choice - fresh fruit smoothie bar omlette station crepe station cereals the usual hot selection on a buffet cheeses and meats and a wide range of bread croissants and pastries. A selection of teas was available and coffee served in cafetieres and left on the table! There are two outdoor swimming pools - a cold one at the Lounge and Spa and a (very) warm one at the adjoining Imperial Palais hotel. Sunbeds were mainly lovely double divan's with plenty of cushions and there were even some four poster style ones for those who wanted more shade than was afforded by sun umbrellas! there is plenty of staff poolside to serve drinks or food and even a man who came round cleaning our sunglasses! we had lunch a couple of days at the poolside restaurant a little bit expensive for what it was but that was compensated by the great service and quality and the ever smiling staff. we ventured into the Lawrence Bar late evening for a drink and there was a truly terrible singing combo on - one of the singers appeared not to know the words and couldn't be heard properly at the end of the room we were in although that was maybe a blessing!! Some of our group ventured to the spa and came back raving about how fabulous it was and how great their treatments were. We used the So Bar as our meeting place pre dinner a lovely place to sit and catch up on the day and enjoy a drink and later in the evening to watch the beautiful people go into the So Lounge (club!).

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,TheGhillie wrote a review Oct 2012,40,An Oasis in the mahem of Marrakech,We were fortunate to find a good value package for our first trip to Morocco and not knowing what to expect were delighted when the somewhat shaky airport transfer experience deposited us at the front of the Sofitel. It was reassuring to be greeted by polite and smartly dressed staff and shown through to the reception lounge for a glass of Moroccan Tea (delicious). Here we had an efficient booking process by charming ladies. I liked that we were shown where the lifts were and told which floor and where to find our room. Nice not to be ushered around the place by some obsequious smurf as if you have had lobotomy a cringe we have had to endure in other 5* places.  Prior to leaving the UK we had made a request for a room with a view if possible. The room on the top floor had a giant of a bed - very comfy too - and a little balcony with smashing views across the pool to the Atlas mountains beyond. Thank you Meriem you excelled yourself. We found every aspect of the hotel we encountered to be clean tidy and comfortable. The staff were charming and helpful without being intrusive and always seemed to have a smile. There was an art exhibition in one of the halls for interest and Internet access available from a business room. The warm pool was great just the ticket as the weather was not kind and all the sunbeds hammocks and 'Bali beds' were clean and there were the plentiful towels.  We ate in l'orangerie first night and Fatima guided us through the menu beautifully. Tasty. We found the variety at breakfast was plentiful and I enjoyed trying the Moroccan dishes - something for everyone. One thing though an area in the outside seating that for us non-smokers and others like us could have enjoyed without the whiff of burning bush would have been welcome. I would seriously suggest this is considered by the Hotel. I saw at least one minor grump by a lady who asked the chap at the table next door not to puff over her and her food. She had my sympathy.  This hotel is ideally situated so we walked everywhere (crossing the main roads is cheaper than bungee jumping into crocodile pond and just as scary!!) except at night on our way back from the Souks when we used a taxi (staff will give you an indication of cost to assist with the Taxi haggle).

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Jenny_1LincolnUK wrote a review Oct 2012,40,"Lovely hotel, Marrakesh was a big disappoinment.","We stayed at the Sofitel Longe and Spa for 4 nights returning on the 2Oth October. Our stay at the hotel was positive overall. The facilities are what one would expect from a 5 star hotel. Friendly staff large well appointed room huge comfy bed decent bathroom. Bed linen is changed every day and towels twice a day. The lighting was a bit on the dull side but that is an issue of style over function. There are no tea or coffee making facilities which is a shame but not unusual. Our room had a balcony overlooking the swimming pool and garden which we found relaxing. Unfortunately the weather turned cool and rainy which put a damper on our stay.    Breakfast was very good with plenty of choice. If you want ordinary tea be sure to ask for Liptons.    Drinks seem expensive and the price varies according to which bar you are in. Two gin and tonics can cost 220Dirhams about ¬£16.00. A 330ml can of tonic is ¬£4.25. However the gins are at least double strength so I suppose we can't complain too much. Beers are about ¬£4.00 for a small bottle. The So Bar and the Orangery have live music every evening for about 3 hours and are good places to relax and unwind.    I found dinner in the main restaurant disappointing but have never been a fan of ""local dish"" which seems to be an excuse for charging premium prices for low quality food. When I said I hadn't enjoyed the meal (lamb and couscous) the chef came to the table and was very apologetic offering to cook me another meal. His concern was genuine but I really couldn't face more of the same. I've back packed in India and had no problem with the food but this didn't float my boat sad to say. When I'm paying western prices I do expect quality ingredients not scrag end of neck overcooked vegetables and a mound of tasteless padding.    On a more positive note the staff were friendly and happily spoke to us in English. We experienced no discrimination on that score.    On balance I would recommend the Sofitel Lounge and Bar especially if as we did you can get a good deal from a travel agency. Marrakesh itself is another story altogether and those who are planning a trip should read the Marrakesh T.A. forum and take note of the negatives which although in the minority give a more realistic view of the city.",Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Lincoln UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jenny_1LincolnUK

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Karen B wrote a review Oct 2012,40,Very relaxing stay,Very relaxing four day trip at Sofitel Loung & Spa. We were a party of 8 and booked superior rooms with pool view. Beds were really comfortable rooms were a good size with a great balcony area. Only negative comment regarding the rooms would be the lighting. There are bed side lamps and a lamp on the table but no central lighting so it is quite dark in the evenings when you are getting ready.    There are two outdor pools (one warm/one cold!) both which had plenty of sun loungers (individual and bed style) with staff replenishing towels regularly. There were quite a lot of flies when sun bathing by the pool which you are constantly brushing away but not sure how the hotel could remedy this?! Spa area was really stylish although needed to book treatments in advance - there was no availability for Friday afternoon/Saturday morning so I was unable to book but two other people in my party were able to secure bookings earlier in the week.    Breakfast choices were plentiful - egg station crepe station cold meats/cheeses salmon pastries breads fruit and yoghurts. Food was of a really good standard. I particularly liked the 'smoothie station' where they made smoothies to order. Lunch menu by the pool also had good choices and was reasonably priced. The bar area in the SO bar was nice & drinks were expensive for Marrakech but what you'd expect in a 5* hotel - vodka and mixer was ¬£8/¬£10 but Morrocan wine was reasonable at ¬£15 a bottle. Staff in the restaurants were really attentive.    There was an issue with one of our rooms (it was booked as a twin and upon arrival was a double). Reception were slow in resolving the issue. However the hotel Manager introduced himself asking how our stay was whilst we were at the pool and when I mentioned this to him it was resolved within 30 mins of the conversation.    Hotel is a great location 10 mins from the main square and 15 from the airport. Really enjoyed my stay and would definitely return if back in Marrakech,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenbS1420SK

On the way walking in we just hoped that our a-week holiday would have been unforgettable YES it was horribly unforgettable one.    At the reception the welcoming was SO COLD 20 mins to get the check in process completed and get a room key. A guy who was checking us in just left in the middle of the process (Dinner break?) and a young lady just took care of the rest without excusing or explaining anything to us and we started again. (She said you filled in the form and I will be back) SO unprofessional. No information about the hotel facilities given neither any anticipation of our expectation. We discovered by ourselves each day.    On the following day we asked where we could find the breakfast room a girl just point to the right and say it's just over there.    Poor service of the Pool bar restaurant even though the pricy item on the menu which we were ready to pay. A lot of staffs walking around doing nothing instead of giving attention towards the guests.    Many technical issues encountered during the stay the room was not at all what we expected. Bed was not comfortable at all A/C didn't work and etc.    Having walked and seen so many staffs on the corridor each day they just ignored us didn't even say ""Hi"".

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Bettina M wrote a review Oct 2012,30,Nice place - at least at first sight,The Sofitel Marrakech is a beautiful hotel located in the Hivernage the trendy new part of Marrakech. The lobby and restaurants are luxuriously furnished and you expect five-star treatment from its appearence. Don't be disappointed if you won't!    In our room the carpet was stained two out of four lamps were not working the toilet leaked and the TV was out of order. You would think it takes one call to housekeeping in order to fix all this. No it doesn't. At times we had three officials in our room one as helpless (and as uneager to help) as the other. Except for the toilet nothing was fixed but a lot of promises were made some of which were repeated daily.    We made the same kind of experiences at breakfast: We were early guests and we had the impression that the service staff arrived at seven o'clock as we did: Tables were not set no napkins it took up to 15 Minutes to get a simple coffee... Many times a waiter just forgot what we asked for. There's plenty of staff everywhere yet it's unefficient and slow.    All in all it was a mixed experience: The hotel's location is great it is nice and quiet - and yet we did not feel welcome as guests.,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Frankfurt, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BettinaM312

The rooms were spotless towels and linen cleaned on daily basis and yes beds fantastic. Staff friendly and polite. Swimming pools lovely and always plenty of shade and beds. Breakfast is excellent. We had lunch at the pool restaurant and ate in the So Club on one occasion. Drinks and food are a little expensive but service and quality excellent. Location - approx 15 min walk to main square with pavements and generally well lit plenty of taxis but walk down street for a few 100 m's generally cheaper.

The bad; some pool staff seem more intent on catching up on gossip with their colleagues than serving guests.    The ugly; room not ready when we arrived. Not a problem we were given a voucher for a couple of drinks and told reception would come and get us when the room was ready. An hour and a half later I returned to reception to find our room was ready. They said our bags would be delivered to our room. Forty minutes later I went down to reception to find that our bags hadn't moved an inch. My laundry went missing. Two visits to reception drew frowns and assurances that something would be done. Two hours later I went myself to housekeeping and it was in my room within five minutes. No hot water on one day of our five-day stay. Yes no hot water in our room. Yes it claims to be a five-star hotel!    Despite all of this we decided to extend by an extra night. I asked at reception. They said ""It depends if we have rooms available."" I waited. I asked ""Do you have any rooms available?"" ""I'd have to check"" was the reply. I waited. ""Could you check?"" I probed. ""I'm sure we have"". I gave up and booked online despite the pathetic strength of the WiFi service. ""Booking a hotel has never been easier"" claims the Accor site. Unless you're using WiFi from an Accor hotel.

At check in we were seated and given mint tea and macaroons before being told that we had been upgraded to a junior suite ;). We booked out stay though an online offer and were Deffinatly not disappointed.  The room was large with a separate toilet to the bath and sink (good when there is 2 of you getting ready) the balcony overlooked the pool which played music most night but this was more soothing than irritating. The bed was fantastic and huge totally like sleeping on a cloud.  The pool area is good with seating and covered cabanas hand and foot massage available by the pool. Need to get your drinks from a waiter round the pool as you cant bring your own but the price wasn't too bad. 2 different pools 1 hot 1 cold with water sprays and jacuzzis.  Breakfast is fantastic with an aray of foods but not you Brits there is no bacon and egg here but there are inlets creps smoothies and meat platters.    We visited the SO lounge for dinner wich was fantastic.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Astronaught wrote a review Sep 2012,40,Wonderful experience but not quite 5 star,The Sofitel is rated as 5 star but don't expect the same 5 stars as you'd get in say the UK or the USA. Don't get me wrong parts of the Sofitel are 5 star the staff are exceptionally polite courteous and very efficient (I didn't open a door all week). The breakfast experience is also fantastic with the choice and service both being top class although I would have liked the options / food to be changed every few days but that's just being picky. The rooms however I feel are 4 star bordering on 3 with 'cheap' doors that drop on opening and with hinges that 'bang' when opened. Some doors such as on the TV cabinet were also fashioned out of older doors that looked wrong and didn't fit. With that said the rooms were clean of a fair size and well equipped (although no tea and coffee facilities which was sadly missed). Stand out features of the hotel are the sheer size of the place the reception areas the staff and the panorama of the Atlas mountains althoughfor me the real stand out feature is the experience. Taking everything into account this place is amazing and i'd definately recommend it just don't expect everything to be perfect things mentioned above plus slow wifi no spoons with cups waiters forgetting stuff etc but as I've said this is nit picking and won't bother you if you have the right attitude and a sense of humour.

From the time we arrived all the staff showed impeccable manners in every aspect of customer service - we were their guests and we would be treated as though everything had to be done for our benefit and pleasure. In a busy and strange city for us visiting Marrakech Morocco and Africa for the first time the Sofitel was a great choice - the location for getting into the old and new city was ideal and after walking the streets and markets knowing you had such great accommodation to return to was a real bonus. The extra touches apart from what you would normally expect really helped the guests to appreciate their surroundings - the flowers in the entrance the herb garden the quality of the art all helped to make you feel you in somewhere that was run for the enjoyment of its visitors. On arriival we were upgraded to a beautiful room in the pavilion but were then offered another upgrade to an even better room the following day. You should also look out for the bar manager with the six inch high heels - quite a feat to walk in these at all.

From the moment we stepped through the door until we left we were treated like royalty the staff could not do enough for you. The hotel itself is beautifully decorated to a very high standard We were lucky enough to stay in the Opera Suite which was fantastic with two seperate bedrooms a living room and three bathroom/shower areas. The breakfast was amazing with everything you could wish for including freshly made smoothies/juices at your request.    We ate lunch at the hotel every day around the pool and whilst it was more expensive than your average pool lunch this is a five star hotel. We had dinner at the hotel twice once at the SO Bar and once at The Orangerie. Both meals were of a good quality. There are some good place to eat near to the hotel too and in fact every meal we ate was fantastic.    We didnt take any treaments at the Spa but it was beautifully decorated and offered a good range of treatments. If I had to make one suggestion it would be to check your bill very carefully when you check out. They seem to have a habit of adding 'extras' that you have not received. There was no problem getting these items removed but you must check.    This is a fab base from which to explore Marrakech and I can't recommend this hotel enough!

The journey took less than 15 minutes. On arrival the front entrance is spectacular we do however agree that the welcome does not reflect the usual 5 star welcome i.e. cold towel and welcome drink.    The receptionest was pleasant and he took us on a tour of the public areas of the hotel he informed us we had been selected for an upgrade which we were initially pleased about.    On arrival at our room we were dissapointed at the standard of the room which and initially breathed a sigh of relieve as I didnt want to think about the standard of room I had initially booked. We unpacked cleaned the room and made it presentable for us.    On the second day I took a walk to the Lounge and spa section (adjacent) which was spotless modern and clean. I asked the same receptionistif I could check my original room as I was unhappy with the upgrade. The initial room was awesome and I immediatelly asked to be ""downgraded"" (never heard off) I was unhappy as I had lost 1 1/2 days of my holiday cleaning unpacking dissspointed and then repacking and unpacking. I recieved a half hearted apology and an insistence that the room we had been given was an upgrade (no way).    I have to say from here the hotel began to shine breakfast was awesome although we ate inside to avoid the flies and wasps. The restaurant manager enquired about the service on a daily basis which was good to see. I disagree with others about the service at the pool area there were plenty of staff great service and managers on patrol regularly.    The pool area is the cleanest we have ever seen. The beds furniture and surrounds were washed and cleaned every day. The variety of areas for privacy or relaxation was amazing and one of the best we have experienced. Prices were as previosly stated expensive but the whole hivernage area was on par with London or Paris prices.    Some great restaurants in the vicinity (will write a review seperatelly). Asked the concierge where we could eat in the Medina and he looked at us as if we had crawled out from under a stone and made a comment like ""well if you want to do the basic tourist thing thats fine"" course we do we are tourists we want to experience the real deal. They must be on commission for recommending some of the restraurants and we didnt ask him again    Over all this place grew on us lessons leaned check the room booked and be satisfied that you have been given an upgrade.

The hotel has several beautiful pools and the design of the outdoor area means that you can always find a quiet sunbed. The restaurants are great and the buffet breakfast really does serve everything you could possibly think of - my friend ate 5 courses one morning. The standard of the rooms and facilities go without saying but for me the most important thing about the sofitel was the fantastic service from the hotel staff they really could not have been better so kind thoughtful helpful fun and just brilliant.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Katherine M wrote a review Sep 2012,40,"A really impressive hotel, fantastic customer service!",My friend and I stayed here for 5 nights in the first week of September 2012 and were really impressed. The communal areas lobby rooms and pools were incredible. Beautifully decorated very oppulent and the flowers (planted and cut) were absoutely stunning. Having worked in the hotel industry I know what it takes to keep a hotel looking like that and I was thoroughly impressed. The staff were very polite and friendly. For a hotel that size it did sometimes feel slightly impersonal but there isn't much you can do about that. The only thing that stops me giving it 5 stars is that it was so expensive! But there is a Carrefour 15 mins walk away and so we bought water wine and snacks from there. I would definitely recommend it for families couples or friends.,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/930katherinem

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Fiona K McCarthy wrote a review Sep 2012,50,Please Please take advantage of this wonderful hotel,I am at present staying at this amazing hotel.    This hotel came up as a bargain getaway six months ago - as I had previously visited this hotel for drinks I decided to book it and hoped it had not gone down in anyway. OMG on the contrary as the deal I got was so amazing I assumed WRONGLY that the place may need decorating or updating - how wrong was I.    Firstly I had a great flight on Ryanair at 6.30 am from Stansted = for me a big plus.    Secondly arrived and the hotel is 10 minutes from the airport = for me a huge plus.    Thirdly the room was amazing new clean and comfortable two happy bunnies for sure.    At 11am I was lounging on an amazing lounger catching rays happy days - cant be this good something must be a miss.    WRONG    Breakfast is amazing and quality - a stool for my beach bag - REALLY but thank you.    Service amazing - weather even better - cant find a thing wrong.    So my middle east replacement has been found - Sofitel Marrakech reasoanably priced amazing comfort and service 10 mins from airport - sadly and I am not proud but it is my third visit WE HAVE NOT LEFT THE HOTEL.    Why - why would you I have four nights five full days here - weather is amazing and possibly the last I will see this year = so chill and sunbathe OK I will.    Should you wish to adventure out please do = the medina is 5 mins away in a cab and well worth a visit - I will miss it this time however I will return again and soon.    Restaurants here are something else = very french influenced so very good - LOVE LOVE LOVE IT HERE.    sofitel is the way forward = enjoy xx,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fionakproperties

Would certainly visit again!!,Our family really enjoyed our time here such a refreshing change from the more obvious holiday choices . The way of life & culture was a delight to experience. The hotel was comfortable & very clean the service was a little hit & miss & they did mess up by not collecting us from the airport & a few other things but they did try to make amends. The pool area was pleasant although we did have some shoes stolen (the pool is open to guests & it was suggested that this had been the problem) breakfast was super & in nice surroundings. We ate out every evening & found some real gems & great value.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,rajp9277 wrote a review Sep 2012,40,Wonderful stay in Marrakech!,We have just come back after a lovely 5 days in Marrakech. We booked Sofitel as a part of a package that included flights breakfast and one session at the Sofitel spa. The hotel is conveniently located from the airport and the Medina in the new part of Marrakech. Check in was hassle free were offered a cold towel and iced tea on arrival whilst waiting to be checked in! Our room was spacious and comfortable with a balcony offering views of the pool. Our room was made up twice a day with a tuck-in service and rose petals on the bed every evening which was a nice touch! Breakfast was sumptuous with good variety of fresh fruit/fruit juices cold meat cheese eggs and bacon crepes and a variety of bread! We felt that breakfast was filling enough to skip lunch every day and that's what we did! The pool area was well maintained and spotless! The lounge areas were very cozy with the smell of sweet incense wafting all the time and mint tea on offer most of the day and evening! We did not eat in any of the restaurants in the hotel as they seemed expensive and had read bad reviews about them on Tripadvisor. But the restaurants seemed to have a good ambiance about them. The spa facilities were very good: included a hammam sauna and an indoor pool with a few rooms for the treatments. Our deal did not include treatments but got to use the other facilities which was very relaxing after a hot day out in the sun! The hotel is well located for the medina and the new parts of the city but do make sure to hail a taxi from the streets outside the hotel (not the ones standing outside the hotel as they tend to charge you almost 3-4 times the actual price!). The staff very helpful and friendly but would recommend doing the tours with independent operators suggested on tripadvisor. Would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again on a visit back to Marrakech.,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rajp9277

We did not book breakfast at the hotel there is a cafe 5 mins walk where we would have a lovely breakfastlunch and dinner for alot less price and much better food than the hotel. However I would strongly suggust that you plan ahead and do research about what you want to do and see whilst there do not use the concierge!!!! they will try and sell you anything! with a lot higher prices. We talked to the local people and they would recommend wonderful places to go. The pool area was clean yes I agree with some comments that the service was slow as there was not many staff serving around the pool area. We did not use the spa the prices are soooo expensive and the products and treatments are not all that!

Everything else shows signs of very poor management; we were faced with inefficiency incompetence and dishonesty everywhere: at check-in restaurants concierge luggage check. Just few highlights of our stay. At check-in they could not accomodate us adequately or on time. Even when we paid a higher rate they put us in an awful location (we paid more for a better view and got a bunker view for our return stay). We spend 5 hours checking in and lost the whole day instead of finishing our errands on our return. Breakfast which was a buffet was covered in flies and cheeses were drying by the end of breakfast when we arrived. Bon appetit. Concierge was a peak of dishonesty as they misinform you to say the least on any inquiry. Concierge offers you however a VIP car VIP reservation VIP service. What they forget to tell you is that you are treated for a fool. I would check all information at the internet center yourself. One outrageous example yes there are trains and buses going around Morocco it is sad to know that concierge was never informed. Another it took them entire day to make a reservation for our dinner at a restaurant (""there are many restaurants at this hotel it is fully booked but we can get you a VIP reservation""). In the end we called ourselves and made a reservation at the last moment the only restaurant at this hotel was very empty and we had a very personal service just because we came.  There could be worse staysbut you pay for what you assume to be comfort and this is what you are not getting at this Sofitel.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Nermine E wrote a review Aug 2012,30,Not Worthy of Being a Sofitel...they can not get anything right.,"We stayed in this property from August 12 to the 16 2012. We were to check out on the 18 but paid penalties to change our airfare in order to get out of there. Basically the hotel is badly managed all around and it is reflected on every customer experience one gets. We were given a room where there is no hot water and the hotel staff knew about it but lied to tell us it is a problem in the whole hotel and they are working on it to be fixed momentarily. After two days of cold showers and bad food and beverage service delivery we complained to the general manager and we were upgraded to a suite and refunded one of the nights. We were happy that finally our miseries with this hotel will lessen. Well not the case the mattress on the king size bed in the important suite # 207 was high in the middle downward slopping on each side. One side had more of an angle than the other which gave us back pains and we could not sleep properly. What is the first basic thing in a hotel ...the bed...well a five star Sofitel does not have the management strengths and the quality control of their ""bed"" element among other things. The other very annoying matter is that the staff is not well trained and the staffing is allocated all wrong which has a repercussion on the quality of service delivery. For example one had one or two people to serve around the pool and 5 other just walking around asking guests if they are ok and if all is well but they do nothing else but PR. So even if you want to complain one does not know who are these people and what is their authority to resolve a matter. The empty plates bottles and glasses around the pool would not get picked up causing an army of bees to attack the items and the guests. One would place an order to eat and gets it missing the basic salt and peper and other stuff that takes 15 minutes to come around. It was extremely aggravating. The day we were checking out we went to the breakfast buffet that is supposed to open at 7 am and it was 2 minutes before 7 am well the man would not open the restaurant because of the 2 minutes and when he did there was no staff to be found and the buffet was not in a state of readiness at all. We went to the Orangerie Restaurant in the hotel one evening. It was a nice set up but awful food and bad service. They had a singer and dancers but the music system was not working well and was squeaking meanwhile employees including the general manager of the hotel are spending their time to ask you ""how you are doing"" (one gets 10 of those in one sitting) instead of actually managing putting the right resources in the right place and getting it right according to Sofitel's international standards. The hotel had lousy Morrocan food both at the Buffet and the Orangerie which is supposed to be their signature restaurant. The funny thing is that we ordered a chicken Taginne (a typical Morrocan dish) from room service and it was 10 times better than the one we had in the hotel's up-scale Orangerie restaurant!!! About he Spa I asked how much it would cost for a manicure and pedicure they said it is by the hour? so I was startled as normally any where in the world there is a fixed price so I got turned off.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,NaomiCharles wrote a review Aug 2012,50,"Amazing service, beautiful hotel",We chose Marrakech as our honeymoon destination and stayed in Sofitel for the duration. We were really pleased with our choice as it was a wonderful hotel and the staff at Sofitel made our stay the best it possibly could have been. The service was excellent throughout. Every member of staffwhether it was a housekeeper manager porter or a member of the reception staff made a genuine effort to say hello ask how you were and ask if there was anything they could do to help you in anyway. We had breakfast included with our room price which we would highly recommend as if bought separately it is very expensive. The breakfast was exceptional and we could not believe how much choice there was! We had omelettes smoothies and crepes made to our preferences every morning and the quality of the food and service was excellent. Our room overlooked the pool and was very comfortable and luxurious. Room service was very prompt and nothing was too much trouble for the service staff. The hotel and spa were always beautifully presented with fresh flowers and everywhere was perfectly clean. There was a lovely ambience to the hotel and we felt very comfortable throughout our stay. The only slight downfall was the prices at the restaurant and bar within the hotel. We tended to eat out in the evenings as it was too costly to eat and drink at the hotel for the duration. The hotel was very quiet during our stay due to it being the month or Ramadan but this did not affect the quality of the service in any way what so ever!  An extremely memorable holiday we would highly recommend this hotel to others!,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Reading, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NaomiCharles
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Jenfez wrote a review Jul 2012,20,"Beautiful entrance, terrible service",We stayed at this hotel for one night in July before catching a flight from Marrakech airport the next day. We were not very impressed with the service.    The front of the hotel and reception area are really beautifully finished but we'd clearly arrived at a busy time of day and had to wait until we could complete the check-in. We were also not offered cold towels as other people have described. There is a really nice man who gives out mint tea in the reception and he brought us some tea.    The pool area is really nice but was so so busy - completely packed with people in the afternoon and it was nearly impossible for us to find a bed. There seemed to be a lot of beds with old towels on or that people had left their stuff and gone off for the afternoon. It took a long time to get someones attention to order some drinks and then they took a long time to arrive. The food and drinks by the pool were the most expensive and overpriced that I had experienced in Morocco although the food was nice. The swimming pool itself is lovely. It seems like they should concentrate a bit more on the service of food and drink and not on a sunglasses shining service.    The room was fine and had everything you might need and the air-con in the room was good. The balcony was also nice with a comfortable seating area.    On the last day I wanted to eat lunch in the hotel. I wanted to eat indoors as the temperatures were very high and the only place to eat is in the buffet restaurant at a high price. The only other option was the pool snack bar which had no air-con. I only wanted a small sandwich and there was no-where to order one in the hotel and sit indoors (by this time I had checked out of room). I tried to sit just outside the reception area and get some food however the woman serving in the area was very rude. This left me with a bad impression of the hotel.    There is a small clothes shop in the hotel lobby and I bought a few things. The woman serving in the shop was really friendly and chatty.    We also stayed at the Sofitel Essaouira and thought that the Marrakech Sofitel did not come close to the excellent level of service provided at the Essaouira hotel.,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bern, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jenfez

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,byronc83 wrote a review Jul 2012,50,Saved by Sofitel,We recently stayed at the Sofitel Marrakech and had an amazing time. We had originally booked into a Riad in the central Medina area but when we discovered that the air conditioning wasn't working (unfortunately at midnight!) we had to try to find somewhere else that would be able to help us with a room at the last minute. This was our fist time in a Sofitel and I must say that we were not disappointed.    I would recommend this hotel for anyone who wants to be able to quickly access the best points of Marrakech from a tourism perspective while still having a relaxing oasis to return to when they aren't out and about in the city and need a break from the heat.    Best Points:    1) The Pool: The pool is fantastic with large lounges all around the perimeter. Each lounge has multiple umbrellas for when you want some shade and there are plenty of staff to help you with towels the umbrellas and anything else you need while relaxing. Given that the temperatures are so high in July the pool was a real life saver as you could spend the morning hours touring the Medina and other historical places and the hot afternoon out by the pool relaxing. I think staying in a Riad at this time of year would be a bit of a struggle as they don't have the amenities of a larger hotel such as this.    2) The Breakfast: We had breakfast included in our room rate and it was fantastic. A very large buffet selection with fresh juices smoothies fresh made eggs and omelettes all types of pastries crepes etc. A great way to kick off the day before touring around town.    3) The Design/Standard: The hotel is beautifully designed and kept to a high standard. The staff were very friendly and said hello to us every time we passed by.    4) The Room Rate: The room rate (which included breakfast) was a great value and was actually less expensive than staying at many of the high-end Riads in the Medina. I have paid a lot more for hotels in the past that cannot compare to the standard of this hotel.    5) The Location: While technically not in the central Medina of Marrakech the hotel is very conveniently located just outside the walls of the city. It is a 10-15 minute walk or a 5 minute taxi ride (which are very inexpensive) into town. There is a taxi rank right outside the hotel so you can grab them with ease. Also because the hotel is well known it is very easy and safe to get a taxi back there at night.    Some Areas for Improvement:    1) Price of Food/Drinks: While I usually expect food and drinks within a hotel to be a bit on the pricey side I did find that the price of beers cocktails and food to be a bit higher than I would have expected. We mostly ate our meals / had drinks outside the hotel but it would have been nice to feel like we could have a few pre-dinner cocktails without breaking the bank.    2) Food Service by the Pool: The service by the pool was friendly and accommodating however we did find that it took some extra time for food / drinks to arrive than would be expected. Wasn't too bad but could be improved.,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/byronc83

Location is excellent too not far to Medina in a nice area with some good restaurants in walking distance.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Ewilko88 wrote a review Jul 2012,40,Great location! ...Not so great service!!,My friend and I recently spent four nights at the Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa we thoroughly enjoyed our time experiencing Marrakech. The hotel is situated in a perfect location for the medina it was approx 15min walk (slightly longer in the heat).  The hotel the surrounding grounds and the breakfast were outstanding. The service however was not so great! We felt it was very poor for a 5* hotel. The doormen were very courteous the ladies on reception were very rude and the service at breakfast each morning was very poor! We found that they were not very attentive at all despite lots of staff being in the restaurant. The selection and choice of food was brilliant! I've never experienced anything like it.    We were upgraded to a Luxury Room I really couldnt see or find anything luxurious about it it was most definitely in need of a refurb. The bathroom and furnishings were very worn out/tired looking. Again I didnt expect this for a 5* hotel.  As we had a 'Luxury Room' this meant we overlooked the pool. Every other night we experienced very loud music quite late in the evening which kept us awake.    Beware that the hotel staff are quite slow to respond I wouldnt say they were very proactive at all.  We had to chase three times for bottles of water to be sent up to the room over a space of four hours! To me this was unacceptable when you are in 43 degree heat!    Beware that to eat and drink at this hotel is quite pricey. We found a lovely cafe/restaurant just a short walk from the hotel called 'Cafe Extrablatt'. We actually saw quite a few guests from the hotel here. It's quite a busy/lively place to eat. Note that the drinks are cheaper on the ground and first floor if you drink on the rootop you will find drinks are more expensive as that is the only place you are allowed to consume alcohol in the restaurant it is more of a bar/lounge.,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Haywards Heath, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ewilko88

They all were facing the street where 2 big discos are. Because of the noise of the people and the disco we spent a very bad night (Fights and police presence included). We have to wake early in the morning I left the room and went to work.  I found out that I had forgot the dressing case and my trunks.  I went back to the hotel at 6:00 PM. I asked them to check if it was there. After waiting for 30 minutes they told me that they hadn't found anything but that they would send somebody to check for the trunks in the balcony where I had left it. After waiting for other 20 minutes They said again that they would send somebody to check for it.  As I had to take a plane I asked them to check for it as soon as possible. No response. Then I asked them for the official book of complaints and assuming I was stupid they gave me an ordinary piece of paper. I then asked to talk to the supervisor but of course he was not there. I Am back in Spain now. I called them but they had me waiting for 10 minutes on the line and nobody answered.  For sure an experience I don't want to have in the future.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,farmfresh wrote a review Jul 2012,40,Good option for Marrakech,Have just spent 5 nights at the hotel on our first visit to Morocco. We were glad we chose to stay out of the medina and at a hotel with a swimming pool as temperatures were in the 40s C during our stay. It is only a short walk to the square from the hotel but it was too hot to to do so and we took cabs there instead.    We had two rooms in the Lounge and Spa part of the hotel both were well maintained and clean with good air conditioning. The pool area was also well appointed. Our room rate included breakfast which was buffet style and very good along with a reduced rate on spa services. I had a massage which was just fine.    In short it's a good choice for Marrakech. The only real shortcoming is the lack of dining options especially if you have children. There is no extended hours cafe/light style food option surprising given that the Palace and the Spa are essentially one big hotel. The food at L'Orangerie was fine for the first night but afterwards we ate at some of the nearby cafes - ExtraBlatt Pepe nero in the medina and Amaia in the new town.,Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,nz,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/farmfresh

I could see why as they are amazing and very clean    The inside of the hotel is very classy and stylish and outside is even better they have hammocks outside also they have 4 poster sunbeds outside too. The outdoor pool is very clean and not overcrowded. I would def book this hotel if I came to marrakesh again as the souks and the medina city all in walking distant and no need to fight with those pesky taxi drivers!     Please remember on your checkout prepare to have a heart attack if you used their mini bar in the room and also the local tax is payable. We paid approx 400dh for 7days worth of tax.    Tip the room service and it's garaunteed you will get first class service.,Date of stay: June 2012,,"Luton, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShibluM
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,helenreadBasingstoke wrote a review Jul 2012,40,wonderful hotel,Have just arrived back from a four night break in the Sofitel Marrakech it was part of a deal and reduced price so can't complain about being put in a room outside a noisy bar and having a view from our balcony of the air conditioning units!  The hotel grounds and pools cannot be critisised as they are beautiful and kept very clean. It is a 15 minute walk to the Medina with many places to eat just ladies watch what you wear i felt more comfortable covering my shoulders and wearing cool trousers even though it was very hot.  Did eat in the hotel once found the food gorgeous but very expensive ¬£35 for the cheapest bottle of rose!  Most of the people there were French and we did notice that the service was much quicker for them than us sometimes we just gave up and went elsewhere must learn french then i can read the menus without guessing!  Will agree that you must check your bill at the end of your stay have heard nightmare stories so was diligent.,Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,basingstoke,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helenreadBasingstoke
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,HGCDG wrote a review Jun 2012,40,Tale of two halves could be superb,We arrived at the hotel for a 4 night stay as part of a deal. Having stayed in the medina a couple of years ago we were looking forward to staying in Hivernage. We were upgraded to a luxury room as part of the deal it was decorated in a Moroccan style was very clean with a huge comfortable bed. The toilet was separate to the bathroom but it was a bit small. The complimentary products were good though. We were keen to explore the hotel as we had read all the reviews and yes I am in agreement drinks and eats are very expensive. The one time we did eat and drink we were overcharged both times plus had to wait over an hour for a pizza round the pool therefore vowed not to make this error again. We also attempted a drink in the Lawrence bar but were ignored by the staff so decided to take ourselves and our dirhams to La Mamounia which was on the doorstep.  Breakfast was included in the price and it was wonderful as were the staff at breakfast. I did not use the spa facilities therefore cannot comment. I would love to give this hotel an excellent rating but it is flawed which stops me from awarding the max. I hope one day these flaws are remedied as it would have been lovely actually staying in the hotel and enjoying it to it's full potential.,Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Dundee, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HGCDG
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,GraemePartridge wrote a review Jun 2012,50,4 days in Marrakech,We stayed at this Hotel as part of a deal with Zoo travel and were delighted when we arrived a stunning Hotel. Probably the best we have stayed in abroad. I agree with the other reviews on this propery but here are a few tips.....This is four star Hotel with four star prices for example the breakfast if not included in your deal is over ¬£20 a head and a 50cl bottle of water in your room is ¬£2.00 Drinks are over ¬£9 for a cocktail and wine was very expensive. Sandy coloured Cabs are good value but you must agree a price before you start around 20 dn for a short journey and don't get one from just outside the hotel they will want over double ! Head about ten min walk straight out from the hotel on the right is a carrefore shop witch sells every thing you need and the local wine is very good and cheap. finally be ready for a very slow customs at the airport.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Bainmoussant wrote a review Jun 2012,50,Unforgettable experience for a 21st birthday,"I booked a 3 nights stay to celebrate my daughter's 21st birthday in Sofitel Palais Imperial  The hotel is plain beautiful with amazing d√©cor. The scent of the magnificent rose display in the lobby is unforgettable. The rest of the hotel is also sweetly scented. It's very clean and there's a myriad of staff greeting you and genuinely happy to help you and make you feel at home.  Our room was overlooking the pools which was a great view as the swimming pools area is pleasure to the eyes and a heaven for relaxation and sunbathing as well as enough shaded spots for customers preferring this. I enjoyed swimming for an hour every day in the longest pool especially around 10/11 am when it wasn't yet busy .  The breakfast provides a lot of different choices so much that after a 3 nights stay I hadn't managed tasting everything! My daughter was happy to have warm crepes every morning.  We had diner at the hotel restaurant L'Orangerie' one evening. We choose a Moroccan and a French set menu. It was good and filling but pricey and not a gastronomic discovery. Soft music was played (Bubl√© Seal) that I enjoy at home from time to time but in Marrakesh I would have preferred some soft Morrocan music. Luckily the room had a very good sound system (BOSS) and I could choose a radio with the kind of music I wanted to hear and you can use your ipod on the system.    We visited the Medina; a very busy place in the evening which was 'ok' for the experience but I preferred Gueliz. We went to the newest commercial centre Carrefour but it didn't impressed me.  Our best experience was the visit to ""Planete des Epices"" that we found by chance walking outside the Medina in streets that are less tourist attractive. The herbalist gave us a 'lecture' about the healing properties and how to use the different spices herbal teas and Moroccan essential oils which is of special interest to me. We gracefully accepted a glass of hot and honey sweet Moroccan tea and a 10 minutes neck massage each given by a qualified kinesitherapist.    Thanks to Sofitel Palais Imperial Marrakesh its staff and the people of Marrakesh my daughter has had an unforgettable experience for her 21st Birthday.",Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bainmoussant

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,RH20 wrote a review Jun 2012,30,Let down on the last day!,Nice location in the new part of Marrakech walking distance from some fine dining restaurants as well as the famous square in the Medina which boasts souks restaurants and a lot of hustle and bustle!    No issue with our stay in general; friendly staff clean stunning decor throughout and an impressive selection at breakfast.    However it was a major let down on our last day when there was little flexibility offered by the reception staff to delay our check out time as our pick up was at 5pm which would mean a 5 hour wait on hotel premises without a room. We pleaded on 2 separate occasions and were offered a 1 hour delay only despite the fact that we had an unwell 2 year old to have to manage for all that time. A male member of staff promised to try and get us into another room for a few hours and said he would call our room shortly to confirm no call was received.    Having checked out we sat in the reception area for our 5 hour wait with our very upset and screaming daughter who was also exhausted by this time with nowhere to have a nap. It was uncomfortable to say the least as the lobby was filled with guests checking in/out as well as groups of people who were clearly trying to have business meetings. Not only was it unfair on us and others guests but I doubt it painted the image nor atmosphere that the hotel management would hope for. Yet the reception staff seemed untouched - possibly as we had checked out now and would be gone in a few hours.    Only one of the female staff did seem sympathetic and asked if she could offer our daughter a drink or a cake although that was no use to us at the time and we had to bear the pain.    This was our second stay at a Sofitel in Morocco within a space of 7 months (first time was in Agadir) and I must say that this end experience has spoilt it.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Kelv wrote a review Jun 2012,40,A hotel with a real sense of occasion let down by average rooms and attentive but slow service,Positives: fantasic pool and common areas. Plenty of attentive friendly staff. The rate for the room was reasonable given the standard of the hotel. There are some nice touches - when they saw that we had a baby a special baby care pack including nappies wipes baby bubble bath creams and a mini baby robe was delivered.    Detractions: After seeing the the fantastic reception and pool space the room was a bit of a let down. The carpets and some of the furnishings were marked - and grubbier than I'd expect for a hotel at this end of the market the bathroom door catch was broken and couldn't be opened from inside if shut fully but otherwise it ticked all the usual boxes without really wowing you.  The main detraction though was the hiddeously expensive food and drinks. Over $100 for 2 buffet lunches not including drinks. The mini bar pricing wasn't too severe but it was hard to feel anything but gouged everytime you ordered something to eat or a drink. You can buy the same beers at the supermarket down the street for 20% of what you might stump up here. They also cheekily charge $30 to use the Sauna (like its not part of the hotel!). Overall if you plan to do lots of sitting by the pool I'd reccomend here - but only if you don't mind spending as much again and then some on food & drink. (the service by the pool tends to be slow.

The hotel was awesome upon our arrival our bags were taken to our room while we checked-in. Cold towels and some fruit while we organised the room- which had been upgraded due to my partner celebrating a birthday during the holiday - compliments of the hotel!    Our room was cool and relaxing which was the perfect escape from the some 40 degree heat. An enormous bed and balcony.    The pools are first class with large loungers/couches and beds. Staff can't do enough for you I don't think I opened a door the whole week!    This is a relaxing holiday and hotel there is not much to do and the heat really takes it out of you. The hotel is expensive.... We ate at the pool a couple of days and the restaurant one. Lunch in the restaurant was very expensive and not really worth it to be honest - 90 quid for two.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,maureen g wrote a review May 2012,30,Too expensive for such indifferent service,Certainly not a great hotel. We stayed here because my husband was attending a conference and this hotel was selected by the organizers. Although we arrived at the official check in time we were forced to wait over two hours which was excruciating as we were tired and growing angry watching newer arrivals go straight to their rooms. I had to call four times until someone finally showed up to make the twin beds they assigned us into a king. Also had to call several times until they send a repair person to fix the television. The people at the front desk and the concierge were very busy during our entire stay and barely polite. On the plus side the room was comfortable and attractive. Nonetheless we could have stayed in a fabulous riad for the price we paid for this standard rather charmless large hotel.,Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Fort Lauderdale, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hanalei2014
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Jo A wrote a review May 2012,40,Honeymoon Heaven...and Hell,This is a very overdue review of our honeymoon hotel but anyway...    We visited this hotel in Sept 2011. We wanted a short haul flight that took us somewhere very hot. The area Hivernage is close to the Medina but you are able to retreat back to the hotel and away from the madness.    Rooms: The hotel provided us with a complimentary honeymoon upgrade to a superior room which was very kind with THE most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. The room itself was spacious and well presented. The only downside was that the hallway where the wardrobe is was very poorly lit so you could just about see what you were wearing before you stepped out of your room. Our balcony overlooked the pool and the terrace bar so when we returned in the evening we could listen to the band/music from the bar.    Pool: The pool area is very clean and well maintained. The pool is surrounded by sun beds and a few loungers. We regularly saw guests that were offended that they were expected to use a lounger rather than the more desired beds. The pool area is very much the place to be seen...lots of people with money talking loudly on mobile phones trying to get everyone else to look at them. It cannot be helped though by the end of our stay I even found myself peering over the top of my book at every newcomer to see what shoes bag hair-do and gadget they had. One highlight of my trip was to witness a lady put on her 4 inch heels teeter 8ft over to the pools edge take the shoes off and get in to the pool and do the same when she got out.....I giggled so much I that I dropped my catalogue pose that everyone has to adopt whilst sunbathing at this hotel. The pool itself is a good size and very refreshing in the heat.    Food/Drink: Great food. The prices for food and drink are very high at this hotel. Considering the quality of the food you get in the Medina the prices at the hotel really are not justified regardless of the clientele. We visited Cafe Extrablatt which is 5 mins walk many times for breakfast and lunch. There is a supermarket 10 mins walk from the hotel if you run out of anything. It's also handy for getting extra water bottles for ¬£0.30 if you get fed up of spending ¬£7 on bottles around the pool.    After days of trying to find it we actually found a lovely place that had been recommended to us Cafe Arabe. Great place in the middle of the medina.    This is a great hotel but not for anyone who is looking for a casual break in shorts and flip flops. This is a top hotel in one of the richest parts of Marrakech. Therefore it caters for the upmarket residents and clients. Looking back I had been slightly naive and hadn't researched enough about the area. This hotel is in the equivalent of Beverly Hills and whilst we had a great time it could be slightly intimidating. The prices do put you off too and you go on holiday to relax not to see if you can afford to have something to eat where you're staying.    The only bad experience we had during our stay was at check out. We were asked to pay the bill which we wanted to check as the prices had been so high and we found that someone had had a meal at the So Lounge on the night we arrived and charged it to our room...¬£150. I explained to reception that we had never eaten at the So Lounge and I definitely remembered where we ate that night as it was our first night. Reception showed me the receipt that was kept with the rest of the slips you sign for and said 'yes this is in your folder'. I pointed out that the slip didn't have a signature on it and asked to see the manager of the So Lounge. After discussion they agreed to take it off our bill but if I hadn't have gone through the bill as I'm sure most people wouldn't if they were used to these prices we could have been very out of pocket.    Everything said this is a very good hotel. If you like Dubai etc but don't fancy travelling that far for a short break then this would be perfect for you.,Date of stay: September 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joa253

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,HavanaLoverUk wrote a review Apr 2012,30,"Lovely hotel, expensive extras, no communication",Stayed in the Sofitel sometime last year. It's a good base to explore Marrakech - it's 5 mins to the city walls and allows you some rest-bite from the incredibly intense city centre.    The pool grounds and hotel are absolutely lovely.    Dinner drinks or anything else costs an absolute bomb. So you'll need to be pretty loose with the cash if you want to dine here.    The room air-con was weak and I asked for it to be looked at three times. Heard nothing back from them so I presume this is standard. Not too warm but I would have preferred another couple of degrees cooler.    The bar found it extremely odd that I wanted to take a drink back to the room with me and enquired what I was doing with the glasses (I brought them back once finished). Not particularly welcome for a drink of that expense.    I left a ¬£100 lighter (stupidly) on one of the swimming beds and even though I come back 2 mins later the guy clearing up said he'd not seen it even though he'd cleared our towels away. I've since emailed the hotel TEN times about sending me a reply saying they don't have it (for insurance purposes) but they just ignore me. Despite them replying previously about another issue.    Bit of a let down as far as the correspondance goes.    There was also a couple of items on the bill that weren't ours and I had to get sorted out. They didn't quibble though.

The price of the rooms was OK but in the end it cost us more for the food and the drink than for the rooms. I need to add tht we did not eat a lot and drink a lot. We had an average consomation with a few drinks a day and we ate at the hotel restaurant 3 times. Otherwise we were in the city. The location was just perfect!  So good experience but carefull with the extras!,Date of stay: June 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Annecy,Savoie",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DidierV232

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,baselgirl_1000 wrote a review Apr 2012,40,Nice hotel - service could be better and extras are expensive,Nice hotel well located and lovely pool (one heated) and gardens. The rooms are nice but the service is a little patchy. Extras are expensive. Breakfast is great but the rest of the food is expensive and average. Free wifi  TIP: members of the Accor club get a free drink and if available a upgrade so worth joining before your stay.  TAXI TIP: walk round the corner to hail a taxi as the ones waiting outside will overcharge you as they waited    DETAILS  Location: very nice area (hivernage) and walking distance to main square and souks  Rooms: nice rooms very comfortable bed bathrooms are nice. Shower is a bit of a pain as it floods the bathroom water pressure is not great and water temperature varies. Nice occitane products - shower gel shampoo and conditioner - no moisturiser. Good hair dryer. free water everyday  Wifi: free but very slow if you want to download newspapers or bigger files.  Food: Breakfast is very good with a great choice and some of the best fresh orange juice. The bar with live music is lovely but drinks are expensive. Lunch by the pool is nice but not a lot of choice. Dinner is very expensive for Marrakech and average.  Common areas: beautifully decorated and lovely fresh flowers. Sofas everywhere.  Garden: beautiful garden two pools (one heated) and a jacuzzi - very comfortable lounge chairs hammocks and mattress with pillows.  Service - service is in general good but varies some downright rude others charming. The service at breakfast goes severely downhill if no supervisors are around. Room service varies a lot - some days great others we had to ask the room to be re-cleaned  Prices - prices are on the very expensive end for food and drinks. It is one thing by the pool where you get the service however minibar is outrageously expensive.,Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Basel, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/baselgirl_1000
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,arbitrary_contact wrote a review Apr 2012,40,Great hotel but extras are way too expensive.,The hotelier very ice located in one of the most exclusive parts of Marrakech. Yet it is walking distance from the main square and other city attractions.  The outdoor pool area is great with a wonderfully comfortable lounge area.  The room was spacious and so was the bathroom - the shower though was not well insulated and the floor ended up flooded all the time.  It is a five star hotel and it goes without saying that the extras are expensive: however we took a half a liter Bottle of plain local water from the minibar and they charged it 80 MAD which are almost 10 dollars - sorry this is way too much.  The hotel restaurant (dinner) is average and could be better.  Breakfast is excellent and luckily included in the room rate.,Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,CH,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arbitrary_contact
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,sweetasanut_NZ wrote a review Apr 2012,30,Super surroundings let down by organisation service,We have just come back from a nice trip to Marrakech over the Easter break 2012.    The short summary is:    Be Aware:  - double check every booking you make. be very specific about what you want and need. it is unlikely that they will ask questions but rather just assume.  - If you get a taxi transfer from the airport specify how many bags you have. Golf bags especially!  - taxi payment is to be made to the driver not the hotel. odd but that's how it works.  - 'guides' for the city are nice friendly and good if you are prepared for the 25euro fee.  - negotiate the price of taxi's outside the hotel. it's like a cartel out there but they will go down by 1/2 of the original quote especially if you arrange for a return journey.  - if you take a spa don't let them rush you into a massage treatment before stating what kind you want. It seems they are in a big rush according to my partner.  - this place is expensive compared with any local place (even very nice places) for food and drinks. Double espresso by the pool is 7 euro typical lunch by pool is about 18 euro typical main course at restaurants is 22 euro  - no coffee / tea in the room  - some of the water in the room is complimentary but not well indicated. Check first.    The good:  - lovely hotel. great location and surroundings.  - friendly staff that are happy to 'try' and help.  - spa is relaxing and nice to have on site.  - Gym is well equipped  - pool area is fantastic well staffed and has wonderfully big beds.    the long version:  The sofitel is a beautifully laid out hotel the amenities are 5 star especially the pool and back yard which is something between a traditional garden mixed with all the luxury of a Nikki beach concept. It feels like the place has lots of history and you can see that in the depth of surroundings. - This is by comparison to some of the newer hotels outside of the city that have less developed surroundings and gardens.    BUT:  The service is the let down and it's is not through lack of trying. In fact the pool area is very well served as are the restaurants onsite but it's the house keeping reception and generally poor communication (not language) and timeliness that drags the whole experience down.  Things started poorly when we arranged a taxi service via the reception before we arrived and this came as a small 4x4 that was unable to fit our luggage and had not baby seat which we specified. ow were they to know how many bags we had? well they just had to ask but it is not our responsibility to take the initiative of telling them. So we waited some 30 min for another car to arrive.  Next was the payment of the taxi which we were under the impression this was a hotel service therefore we pay the hotel. Not so... and this poor communication was another let down. I think it is our right to question anyone saying 'you pay the cash to me' when you have arranged a taxi through a hotel. Anyway not big stuff but it is easy for them to improve.    We were then offered an 'upgrade; to the adjacent and apparently more expensive sofitel imperial but after we arrived in the rooms one can summarise that they are:  - traditional Moroccan decor  - no bigger than the sofitel spa and lounge rooms based on Sqm but actually feel smaller due to poor layout.  - older (feel less fresh)  - have smaller balconies    So we asked for a transfer the next day which was duly taken care of but this took an age and as with our first upgrade there was no baby bed and this took about 45 - 60 min to arrive. Participial frustrating since we specifically said it is important it's there when we arrive.    things from there were pretty smooth but when ever we had questions or room orders the length of time was an eternity and give the number of hotel guests I was surprised.,Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,Norway,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sweetasanut_NZ
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,BrianL wrote a review Apr 2012,50,A definite oasis from the hustle and bustle of the medina.,We came here on a four day package which I guess was cheaper than many of the other guests paid. A 5 star Hotel and an experience for sure. A complete change to the hustle and bustle of the Medina and an oasis in itself. The staff are many and very attentive although we found one of the receptionists perhaps less so. Depending on which room you are in we were 283 you may experience some road noise from Ave de la Menara. I suspect if you are on a lower floor there would be less noise than ours on the second floor. We had a great south facing balcony overlooking the gardens and towards the Atlas Mountains. The gardens are wonderful with two large pools one of which is heated and lots of seating on offer and of many different varieties including hammocks. I suspect many guests spend all day around the pool and do not venture out of the hotel which to a point you can understand why.    Our breakfast was included and the selection was excellent and there was a choice of seating inside or out. Finding a table was never an issue even though we were told that the hotel was full.    Location wise the hotel is about a 5 minute walk to the nearest entrance to the Medina although this involves crossing at a major junction so take care and if possible cross with a local. You will then have about a 10 minute walk or 15 minute stroll into the main square which includes passing the Mamounia Hotel. It is a nice walk through the gardens of La Koutoubia.    Apart from breakfast we did not eat in the hotel but we ate in restaurants close by and recommend them if you do not want to eat in the Medina ‚Äì they are Extrablatt (roof terrace) and La Table du Marche. We had drinks by the pool one day which were a touch pricey but I guess that is to be expected.    My wife would also highly recommend a spa treatment at the hotel ‚Äì blissful!    If we ever returned to Marrakech we would certainly consider staying here again.    Any questions please send me a message.    Enjoy your stay.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,AlwaysRoom4Dessert wrote a review Mar 2012,40,An Oasis in a bit of a crazy city,Came here for 4 day trip.  Lovely hotel good location and nice room. Loved breakfast disappointed at price of casual lunch more expensive by far than same standard 5* in Dublin Ireland which is saying something especially when you compare wages here versus Ireland very disappointing.  Another complaint I would have is having agreed to 60 minute Spa treatment and questioning why I only got 50 minute treatment was told all treatments were less 10 minutes as the relaxation & tea after were included in treatment time. I have had Spa treatments in many hotels around world and NEVER was given such an excuse for short treatment. Obviously did not book another one.  Also was not shown around Spa and as Staff did not speak great English never did find out if it had Steam or Sauna!!!  Hotel grounds lovely pools etc.  I think as a 5* Hotel there should be tea/ coffee making facilities in rooms.  So overall by noting comments above and making necessary changes Hotel could get 5 rating as things stand I can't give it at present. One last thing I had read on Trip Advisor that there wasn't a heated pool but did manage to spot one on my last day although the jacuzzi was still cold.,Date of stay: March 2012,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlwaysRoom4Dessert

A very easy walk to Marrakech city walls. Our deal also included 40% off all Spa treatments and I had the best massage I have ever had in beautiful restful surroundings.  Only downside.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,KPosse wrote a review Mar 2012,40,Serenity in the midst of Moroccan hustle,We stayed with a group of 11 from Thursday through to Sunday. The hotel is perfectly situated if you want to go wining dining and clubbing. Marrakech in itself is small enough to be everywhere within 15 - 30 minutes but the Sofitel's location is ideal because you are at walking distance form the best places in town. The staff is kind and helpful the rooms are good enough and the beds are fantastic. Good spa with excellent specialist staff. The pool area is serene as can be in any busy town great pool beds chill atmosphere and a luscious garden. The lounge area between the hotel and the pool could you more staff at times. The wait for drink is simply too long on average. Breakfast is good enough not outstanding. Attached to the hotel is Club So. The place to be according to some. The interior is good staff is great and the band is good enough. BUT the singers are dreadful especially the girl (Asian appearance) who is great looking with great legs but the most terrible singing voice. Can't understand how this tight playing band can cope with this woman in front. Absolutely out of line. Night life starts late all over Marrakech people start dripping in after 1.30 - 2 Am. Does not work for me at least not for 3 nights in a row. In all I would recommend the Sofitel but I would at the same time recommend to check out other hotels as well.,Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Groenekan, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KPosse

Breakfast is excellent and can be eaten inside or outside. Being a French hotel the bread and croissants etc are great and there is a good choice of other food.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,lucysmith31 wrote a review Mar 2012,40,An oasis in the craziness of Marrakech,Check in was efficient and rooms clean and tidy. Lovely balcony but rooms in lounge and spa part can overlook the back of the hotel which isn't as attractive. The best bit about the room was the bed. Sofitel have a lovely squishy mattress topper and amazing pillows. Hmmmmm....just had to recreate the experience at home by putting a light duvet on top of my mattress! The hotel is two in one and the Imperial is grander and the main reception is filled with red roses everywhere! The pools are fantastic. One is heated so fine to swim in even on a grey day and in the rain. Only problem is that the prices of food and drink are over the top. A cocktail is around ¬£15 and a champagne cocktail almost twice as much. Luckily for you the Director has a cocktail party on Monday nights so get in there and grab your complimentary drink! Similarly the spa is v expensive. Around ¬£100 for an hour's massage. All in all a great stay though. Great to get out of the hussle and bussle of the 'big square' and have a drink. The food at L'Orangerie was nice and esp. the dessert trolley and service good. All the staff are very good and acknowledge you all the time and I was pleased to be called 'Mademoiselle' once! Great if you want a bit of space and calm and somewhere to escape to. Very near to airport etc. etc. as already mentioned.

My girlfriend and I are frequent travelers and have stayed in many a hotel in our day but this one was one of our most memorable experiences.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Polly-from-Beds wrote a review Mar 2012,40,Great Location for the Medina and Souks,My friend and I spent a three day mini break here in March 2012.    We had a superior room overlooking the pool and booked bed and breakfast only.    The hotel room was lovely a wrap around balcony a seating area two large single beds which felt a bit hard at first but which proved to be comfy and enough drawers and cupboards to meet our needs. I liked the rose petals on the bed and towels on our arrival. The room had a free safe too and we had two bottles of water provided each day.  The first night we reported that the door to the balcony could not be locked and this was fixed within an hour of us reporting it. The following morning we realised our aircon was not working and reported that - again it was fixed promptly. I think those two incidents are however indicative of the hotel - lovely but just a little tiny bit tired. The room was also quite a walk through the hotel from reception. OK for us but for older people this might have proved a problem.    The breakfast was buffet style with choices to suit everyone including Morroccan foods (a kind of donut which I tried and which was delicious and a kind of breakfast soup which I didn't try) as well as eggs every which way croissant cereals fruits smoothies etc. We had enough to eat every morning to ensure we did not need to eat lunch!    We had read other reports of the high price of food and drink in the hotel and so did not even attempt to buy any there. I guess that is what you would expect from an up market hotel and there are plenty of other eating options close enough.    The pool area was fantastic always enough places for us to flop down on to - hammocks loungers large beds and enough opportunities to sit in shade if we wished. I only went in once but the pool was large and the sun made it not too cold!    The staff all dress in traditional garb they were helpful and friendly and all spoke English and French (at least!) I could get used to having the door opened for me!    The hotel's location cannot be faulted. It is far enough away from the square to be quiet and in a lovely up-market location while within walking distance of the Medina and souks. There was a 6km jogging route nearby which I would have tried if I had packed running gear. Certainly it looked lovely and flat!

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,HMercer wrote a review Mar 2012,50,Oasis of luxury,We flew to Marrakesh to celebrate my wife's and my birthday. We booked the Sofitel because of good reviews on Trip Advisor. We were not dissapointed.  We were greeted by staff in traditional dress and taken through to the sumptious reception area to wait to check-in.  We had a superior room which was very big with seperate seating and dining area neatly laid out with fruit and sweets. The bathroom was a bit tired as the grouting was coming up around the bath and the marble water-stained. We had a view over looking the pool and gardens.  The pool area was fantastic with sofas hammocks and beds to lie on and plenty of attentive staff. There were two pools one warm and one very cold...but good for doing lengths.  The was an excellent Hamman and spa which we enjoyed on Saturday and Mrs M had some treatments and massage.  The food by the pool was very dissapointing for a 5 star hotel the salads were poor and the club sandwich dry.  We did not have the expensive breakfast but went across the road to the cafe where they did excellent coffee Juice and pastries for c.‚Ç¨30 for 4.  The hotel was a quite luxury away from the hustle of the Medina do not be surprised about how shocked you are going from 5 star to the street - this is a third world country.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Rebecca B wrote a review Feb 2012,40,"Beautiful hotel, but lacking in information sharing",I stayed at Sofitel Marrakech Lounge and Spa which may I say really does live up to its five star quality in terms of the quality of decor and the over-priced breakfast. The hotel has a number of restaurants and there is a bar which has live music daily and the food is fair. The manager of the bar is very nice and made our stay worth while. Although the hotel doesn't advertise it this bar offers a three course menu which is free on a monday.    I booked this holiday through Expedia and got a fair deal I suppose although we later met other British tourists who paid significantly less for their hotel by booking with booking.com. They were provided with breakfast at the Kensi Hotel and free cancellation fees..anyway there are a number of international television stations in English Arabic and French so if you do get bored at least there is back up. The room was luxurious and staff seemed very friendly and helpful I must say. On arrival we were given a cup of Moroccan mint tea which was delicious and our luggage was taken to our room. Unlike other hotels there is no pressure to tip staff although it is welcomed if offered. The Spa is chargeable i.e. ¬£20 for a heated swimming pool but the gym is free there is an out door swimming pool but due to the weather it was too cold to use.    The breakfast menu is extortionate so if you don't want to pay ¬£19 per person for an extravagant continental menu then bring extra supplies for your room. There is a safe which the hotel recommend you use and a mini bar which we used to keep our water cool. There is complimentary water given daily.    The hotel is a standard distance from the medina approximately twenty minute walk and seven minute taxi ride. Now for the not so nice information....so if you are picking a taxi up from the outskirts of the hotel ask for a price before you get in the taxi as the drivers are likely to quadruple the price of the fare. Apparently the fare is based on a per person basis and you can ask the driver to put a meter on. Be stern with drivers as they can become very obnoxious and if you hate being lied too (like me) prepare yourself to get into a few arguments. Something to bare in mind is that drivers believe you're rich because you're a tourist so where possible if you are going back to the hotel from the medina or anywhere else for that matter DO NOT tell the driver that you are staying at Sofitel as they WILL charge (say you're staying somewhere closeby i.e. Place de L'Hivernage Novotel or on the hotel strip). When you come out of the airport there will be a host of taxi drivers willing to prey on fresh blood so be stern call the hotel before you leave England to get a quote on the taxi fare from the airport to the hotel. They tried to charge us 250Dirham at first but I wasn't having it and walked off. The driver later asked what appeared to be the taxi operator the cost who then told the driver to charge us 150Dirham please note that this was still over the limit the cost was meant to be 100Dirham....and I don't like being ripped off!! The same occurred when we were going back to the airport the concierge representative ordered a taxi and told us the cost was 100dirham when we arrived at the airport my mother paid the driver 150d but he looked confused when she gave him the money and had the cheek to ask for 200d. I rightly cursed at him and he quickly ran into his car shocked by my tone (I'm not recommending this btw).    So the medina is a beauty but certain areas are a tad mucky so if you have OCD beware. You definitely need to be able to haggle whatever price they quote you for an item offer them a quarter of that and then make your way up. Hotel cleaning staff are paid roughly 20d per day (I've been told) so think about your hard earned money before you throw it down the drain.    And lastly anyone booking through Expedia please be aware. A so-called Expedia representative by the name of Ahmed (HE WORKS FOR SAHARA TOURS) left a list of excursions with costs and a time to meet him. For your 'convenience' he will meet you at the hotel reception at either 10am or 2pm. The cost were twelve times more than the excursions should have been. For example the city have set hammam's at 7dirham plus massages vary at about 40/50d. Ahmed charged myself and my mother a total of 800dirhams this included a ride there and back in the worst taxi known to man (although the driver was very nice). The massage was wonderful as was the hammam although it was cold when going in and coming out of the steam room and into the massage room partly due to the weather. On leaving we couldn't understand why all the staff crowded around us like we were royalty we later found out that it was because we had probably paid their food bills for the month ahead.    Then we were coerced by Ahmed into going on a trip around the medina. This was a pointless trip as the tour guide Abdul was beyond lazy he took us to the La Bahia palace (entry fee 13d) and told us the bare minimum about the architecture and meaning of its many intricacies. As such I earwigged a few tours and learnt a great deal. Instead Abdul sat outside under a fig tree living the life. Then we were attacked by local hustlers trying to sell us metal bracelets which were already rusting...Abdul sat watched and laughed. Then he took us to a pharmacy in the medina where some tourists were pressured into buying things. I said no but others weren't as strong willed. This pharmacy over charges so be aware that Mr Abdul also gets his cut from taking tourists to these little spots even if they bare no significance to you. I've uploaded a picture of him for your convenience (he's wearing the camel colour jacket and 'suave' shades)    So as you can see a very colourful country I wouldn't recommend going in January as it was freezing (picture walking in england in sandals in the middle of december not a good idea).

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,lurogers wrote a review Feb 2012,40,Expensive Luxury. Indulgence In Marrakech.,Stayed here for a romantic weekend with my girlfriend. Wanted to treat her to do something special so was prepared for the expense. First issue was my airport pickup wasn't waiting for me and then I had booked a king superior and they tried to give me a twin standard... I complained and the lovely hotel guest relationship manager gave me a complimentary Mercedes chauffeur for the weekend. Got my room (amazing) and they put rose petals on the bed. When you order room service dont expect it quickly! Spa was incredible. Excellent masseuse and private spa couples suite.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,j_rich2011 wrote a review Feb 2012,40,"Great hotel, shame about Marrakech","Hotel is spotlessly clean and very elegant with a nice lobby and lovely surroundings. The gardens are beautiful and the pools are very grand. There are lots of comfy sofas hammocks and loungers and beautiful flowers and palm trees. There is one main pool which is unheated and therefore ice cold (nobody uses it). The other pool is heated but still too cold - the hotel needs to be less stingy and increase the pool heating.    Room was modern and clean but there are some issues:  1) It was freezing cold - heating did not work and they never fixed it even though we called 3 times  2) No separate shower cubicle in the bathroom and the water kept changing between hot and cold  3) No kettle or tea/coffee making facilities - unacceptable for a ""5* hotel.    Room service was AWFUL! 450 dirhams for a lunch that arrived cold and was disgusting quality. Don't recommend!    Spa was good - it costs 250 dirhams per person for a 2 hour session including access to the hamam and they also bring you tea and dates which is a nice touch. 30 min massage was 500 dirham and was relaxing. Watch out though - was a bit disturbing to walk into the sauna to see a 20 stone French man slobbed out naked on the top bench.    Breakfast was weird - disgusting duck sausages and random mushrooms mixed with some disgusting yellow liquid. Lots of nice carbs such as muffins and donuts but the hot food was disappointing.    Service at the hotel was good everyone said hello and was very helpful and pleasant.    SURVIVAL TIPS FOR MARRAKECH!  1) As soon as you step out the front of the hotel you will be POUNCED ON like fresh meat by tramps and rogue ""tour guides"" offering to show you the city. There is one particular scary man who has a fake ID and claims to be from the ministry of tourism. Take no notice and walk away from him! It is disgusting that the Sofitel let people like this loiter outside the hotel - other hotels have armed security guards who remove tramps and rogues from the front entrances. The Sofitel gate staff seemed happy to let these dodgy harassers remain.    2) Every street you walk along you will be approached by locals. EVERY ONE will claim they are from ""your hotel"" to try and make you feel safe in their company. They will be wearing suits and will try to offer a tour of the medina or atlas mountains (or better yet they will offer you DRUGS!). They are LIARS and must be avoided - ignore them and walk away with confidence.    3) The medina/main square is DISGUSTING and NOT for the light hearted! Monkeys get beaten up to perform for selfish tourists who want a photo - before settling in for some entertainment think about the torture these monkeys go through. Henna tattooists try to tattoo tourists even without their permission just to get money. They will stalk you until you pay and can be very aggressive. I cannot understand how people eat here - there is ZERO hygiene and I saw one man with filthy hands cooking foods for tourists. People follow you everywhere if you stand out as a tourist it's VERY disturbing.",Date of stay: February 2012,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/j_rich2011

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,BHNZ wrote a review Jan 2012,30,"Nice, but could be better",Having stayed in a few 5* hotels this one is not one of the best. Some things were great some were downright poor. But overall a nice stay. We travelled to Marrakesh for Christmas. Arranged a hotel car to pick us up and although this was obviously contracted out the driver was very efficient and informative. Would recommend this over a local cab especially when arriving for the first time.  Check-in was very easy and quick and we had a free upgrade as Accor Platinum members. We had a junior suite which was very large and comfortable and had views of the mountains and over the pool. Some rooms were right by the pool and I imagine not be very private.  As per others' reviews the food is pricey and not of great quality at the hotel. Better to walk to the square and try the local food for about 1/4 the price. The Breakfast buffet is large and impressive though. Room-service is a total disaster. Very poor quality and takes an average of 40mins-1hour!! Wanted a nice breakfast together before my wife went off to the spa. It turned up as she had to leave (couldn't change spa time as it was busy) so she had to have it cold later and I sat there by myself. Very disappointing -especailly when it happened twice!  Location is great and is a pleasant walk with easy directions to the main square.  Would not stay here again as there are some very high quality riads that I was not aware of prior to booking. However if you want the resort style trip with a great pool and relaxing area then this is good and still handy to all the action,Date of stay: December 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Brisbane, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BHNZ

Great hotel in a prime spot between the new city and the Medina. Lovely rooms nice staff and good service but the BUT - and it is a big BUT - is the highly overpriced and not very good food. We arrived late so ate there on the first night in the Orangery restaurant - mediocre and very expensive. Breakfast was not included and we made the mistake of only eating it there on one day (there's a great cafe two mins away with better food and a fraction of the cost).

But this hotel is fabulous and the staff are helpful and charming. The layout of the pool area is excellent....but watch out for the first pool; it is not heated and the mere fact that no-one is swimming in that pool is the giveaway.    There are only two negatives. Firstly the lavatory paper is of a post war quality that does not stand up to the hotels' otherwise very high standards. I recommend a trip to L'Orangrie the upstairs restaurant which is managed by a lady called ""Wiam"" who is constantly yearning attention and I would imagine spends a good deal of time caning the miiror. She has the annoying habit of chastising the staff in full view of the diners. It is quite good entertainment....but a touch unprofessional.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,SR_786786 wrote a review Dec 2011,40,Dream hotel,We stayed here for a week in aug 2010. We arrived at 01.00am my first impression of the hotel was wow it really is amazing it looks like a palace from outside and the attention to detail with everything in this hotel is paramount- service is 1 st class doors are opened for you everyone smiles - the room was really nice had an issue as the room we were in was in the traditional side of the hotel which faced a rOad and there were some building works going on so  Was quite noisy I put up with it for a night then called reception and they arranged another room for me on the other side of the hotel where there is an awesome Art exhibition! Very modern ~ they moved all my bags within 20 mins! The pool and gardens were really stunning there was a dj Playing from afternoon till late - at night he had lights shows and the music was really nice he burnt us a few CDs as we spoke with him and told him how much we liked his music!  This hotel is top class it was absolutely boiling whilst we were in morocco but as soon as you entered the hotel you forgot about the mad weather and the city hustle it was very relaxing especially in the lounge (enterance) as they had loads of chairs sofas and a guy Playing v soothing music on a harp kind of instrument they also would give you free mint tea to drink we often would sit there for 20 mins or so when we returned to hotel - the staff were all really nice just watch out for the concierge desk as this hotel is 5 star the prices can be sky High for excursions we booked a tour guide for a day from them for our first day this guy tought us the ropes as everybody tries to rip you off all about bartering!!! Don't get a taxi from the hotel as they will charge you 4 times the price walk sound the corner and flag down but agree price before you jump in we paid between 3-5 British pounds from there to the new city or the market which is fine - our first night we paid 30 pounds to get back to our hotel!!! Glad we got the tour guide just to teach us a few tricks' watch out for the tour guides as if you want to go shopping they will take you to certain shops where they get commission if you buy! We got ripped off so badly he took us to a chemist with all the herbs etc and the guy in shop was giving us a presentation which lasted about 1/2 hour and showed us the benefits of certain herbs and spices! In the end all the stuff he showed us he wanted us to buy! We really were in a predicament and even for me it was really hard to get out of it without buying anything in the end we bought some stuff but it left me feeling quite angry and from  That point I knew I had to wise up to the tricks!  We booked to go quad biking in the desert with our hotel this was an excellent trip thoroughly enjoyed it  We visited the new city often walked around had coffee lunch or dinner it is much nicer than the market some really nice places to eat also fixed price the price you see on ticket is what you pay! So it's hassle free shopping! I'm not a massive fan of the market as There is a real hard sell from the shop keepers which I don't like if you are just browsing they force items on you - it's hard just to walk in and browse!  We wanted ro go to oureka valley so decided to arrange ourselves than through hotel we found a decent looking taxi with air con! Trust me if you have been to Marrakech you will know what I mean! We asked the driver how much to take us there agreed a price which was 1/3 of what hotel wanted! This trip to oureka valley was lovely it was much cooler there as we went to the mountains we tried climbing to see the waterfalls I gave up as it was way to hard for me in the heat my husband carried on to the top!!! We found beautiful gifts for our family from the little shops there - An artist was writing names in Arabic  which was so Beautifully done we bought some!  This holiday was real eye opener very much what you see on tv in regards to the market however there are plenty of things to do we stayed 5 nights and it was about right - the only thing I would changes about our trip is to travel when it's not so hot as some days we would either only leave hotel mid afternoon if we had gone in morning somewhere we came back to hotel for a siesta! As it was really hot during peak between 48-52 degrees  Definately would reccomend this hotel it's worth paying more to escape the craziness outside to the sanctuary of this hotel!

For instance the floor of the shower was plastic and bouncy not what you expect in a 5 star hotel.  The service is still a bit inconsistent - I asked for a cup of tea with lemon by the pool and had to remind them 3 times to bring it. A 15 minute wait is unnacceptable. Also whilst there are plenty of staff at breakfast I again had to wait too long to get fresh coffee.  Cleanliness is top-notch as is the location and the pool areas are great. Spa is a bit pricey but very attractive.  The hotel hosted a magnificient poolside evening party for the trade show I was attending and they did it fantastically well. The ambience was amazing and the food was stunning. Service was excellent for this too.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,zarelli wrote a review Dec 2011,40,"Nice,posh hotel",We stayed here for 3days in November. The hotel surroundings are beautiful and only a short walk(10mins) from the famous square. Don't pay for the breakfast here there is a great place straight down the road (extrablatt) where you pay between 4-8 euro depending on your wishes. The 2pools are great one heated. There are a lot of French people there and sex & the city wannabes  but if you don't mind than that's fine. I personally loved this hotel and it's grandeur whereas my husband found it too big stuck up and impersonal. Just goes to show same plac different opinions. Gym has all the kinesis equipment but it's more for show and the gym is hardly big enough; more a extra part of the spa. The spa looks beautiful and inviting but the prices are at a high European price range so didn't have any treatments. Drinks are expensive and at average 5* hotel rates. Although 5 euro for a coke/7Up is too high. They must not know that the rest of the world is in economic crisi; which basically means they loose their clientele for food/drinks down the road. We saw quite a few people saying at this hotel going to xtrablatt for breakfast and lunch. Rooms are nice. The beds are just fabulous . The shower over the bath doesn't work unless you ave a very flexible spine and enjoy doing backbends! The detailing in the furnishing could be better(more 3/4* decoration definitely not 5*). when we were there there was a distinct sewer smell and we had to change rooms as the smell was unbearable in the first room. Staff are very good porters and waiters. Front desk staff are professional; can't say they're friendly. The obviously misunderstand acting classy as needing to be aloof; something you wouldn't get in a true 5* hotel. Nevertheless; these things don't bother me and I actually quite enjoy not having to have unnecessary chit-chat; my husband wasn't that enamoured by it all.

These were the two really good thing I noticed about the hotel. The service of the hotel was ordinary. When we checked in we were give a twin bed and was told that they will change the bed to king size double bed but it never happened for the next four days despite of requesting the reception more than one occasion. There was no complementary tea making facility in the room (all the hotel I stayed in in Europe and Asia at least had the option of making your own tea in room). So we had to order tea everyday morning instead. One day when we came back at night after a long day we found that the magnetic key is not working and had to go to reception and wait there to activate the key again. When we were checking out I was charged for using the mini-bar which I never had and had to tell the reception to make a correct bill. The ambiance and atmosphere of the hotel was excellent the rooms were cozy and the quality of sleep was good. The rooms has a nice specious balcony with two sofa and a small table and two chairs which makes it a perfect place to enjoy the morning tea or an evening drinks with a nice view of the mountain. But which matter most 'the service' was not up to the hotel's reputation. All in all it was a good stay and I will recommend the hotel for a holiday trip to Marrakesh.,Date of stay: November 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Basingstoke, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/srijit_nath

Location: The Sofitel was situated on the edge of the ""Hivernage"" district of Marrakech and was close to a city (ie medina) gate so it was an easy walk to the Koutoubia and Djemma el Fna as well as to the Gueliz district (ie the ""new city""). I loved coming back to a quiet luxurious hotel at the end of the day and was very glad we chose this over a riad in the old part of Marrakech.  2. Staff: The staff were very friendly helpful and most spoke very good English.  3. Amenities: The Sofitel was a rather large property and had 2 pools large dining terrace herb garden spa small fitness faciltity and several bars. We mostly ate in the L'Orangerie restaurant which was chicly decorated in subtle tones of silver and dove gray.  4. Room- We requested and were given an upgrade to a beautiful room on the 3rd floor which had a balcony and faced the pool area. It was predominately decorated in white and silver and thus felt very tranquil. Our room contained all the usual amenities (flat screen tv minibar etc) and lemon verbena toiletries by L'Occitane.  5. Food- The breakfast buffet at the Sofitel was superb and in addition to the usual breakfast foods it featured omelettes cooked to order and a juicing stand. Their filter coffee and cappucinos were delicious and their pastry area featured the best croissants and pains aux chocolats I have ever eaten!  6. Wifi- The Sofitel had free wifi however the connection was weak and it took quite a while to hook up to it.  7. Airport Transportation- Not knowing what to expect at the Marrakech airport we booked a car through the Sofitel which cost 25 euros. In hindsight I wish we'd just caught one of the plentiful taxis at the airport as the std taxi rate from the airport to the Sofitel was only 150 dirhams (ie. USD $15).  8. Important Tourist Tip- When going to the souks before leaving a stall make sure to check your bags after making a purchase to ensure everything is there! After an intense bargaining session with a particular vendor he handed me a bag which was missing one of my purchases. When I called it to his attention he was unabashed and scowlingly put the missing item in.    Thumbs up to the Sofitel Marrakech! I would be very happy to stay here again.",Date of stay: November 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Houston, Texas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jemimagold

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Buckrise wrote a review Nov 2011,40,Fantastic swimming pools and sun loungers,We travelled to Marrakech purely to stay in this hotel and use its swimming pool facilities having previously visited it for a day. The pool area is amazing. Lots of choices of sun loungers from shaded cabanas hammocks to sofa loungers. They even had a hammock suitable for my 3 month old baby. The pools are exceptional and very well maintained. My only complaint is about the standard and cost of food in the pool side restaurant. The food is very poor - however as others have mentioned there is a very good cafe outside the hotel. We ate all of our meals there including breakfast. This place is very reasonably priced.    The public areas of the hotel are beautiful with lovely paintings and statues. There are wonderful fresh flowers everywhere.    We had some issues with service. I had emailed in advance to ask for a cot from my son. This was not provided until the 2nd night of our stay despite various members of staff saying that it was on its way. Also the service at the pool side was very slow and it was difficult to get anyones attention.    The room was very nice but nothing outstanding for this category of hotel.,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Lutterworth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Buckrise
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Andy V wrote a review Nov 2011,40,"Fab, luxurious hotel but crazy expensive on food and drink",Currently staying at the lush Sofitel and it really is a gorgeous hotel. We've been on a crawl around some of the top 5 starred hotels in Marrakesh and apart from La Mamoumia which you can only really afford if you're crazy rich we reckon this is the best.  Our room is gorgeous beds are so big and soft gorgeous bedding lovely free 'smellies' in the bathroom we feel well looked after and it's so relaxing. The pool area is also totally lush big beds to relax on heated large pool and regular large pools the decor around the place is so spot on and done with real elegance. Life here is truly 'magnifique' as the sofitel tag line goes.  Only down side is that the restaurants and bars in this hotel are CRAZY expensive which seems a bit mad as in the many hotels restaurants and cafes just a short walk away food and drink is much much more reasonable so we've been exploring those for breakfast lunch and dinner. My advice would be get one of the 'stay 2 nights get one free' type of deals that sofitel often do on their website stay here enjoy all the complimentary bits and bobs and free facilities (Most things in the Spa are extra) but explore locally to eat and drink as you'll save a packet.,Date of stay: November 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Crewe, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flowerpoweredgarden

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Susan b wrote a review Oct 2011,40,Nice and Predictable,Having stayed at Sofitels before we thought we know what to expect. The hotel is situated just outside the Medina in the new part of town which means familiar surroundings sot to speak. We were here for a few days to familiarize ourselves before going to experience the real Morocco in the desert and what turned out to be a stay in a riad.  This hotel is large with several wings of rooms so there is a bit of walking to get to our room which was on the main floor but on the side of the hotel so it was quiet. Nice comfortable very decent size clean room. Nothing special but decorated in a Moroccan theme. Separate bathroom and toilet which was a bit of a novelty.  The staff were ok a bit standoffish and snooty but we really did not require anything from them so it was no big deal. We met a very nice taxi driver on our second day and he offered to be our guide while in Marrakech. We arranged a fee up front so there were no surprises at the end of our stay. This proved to be a very good thing as he worked with us exclusively and showed us not only the city but also the Atlas mountains which is about an hour away.  We also chilled out by sitting by the expansive pool which was beautifully landscaped BUT beware of the exorbitant prices. I know this is a first class hotel but it is not situated in a very high rent city/country so how they can justify $7 cokes and $16 cocktails is totally beyond me. I though must say in their defense their prices are typically found in many restaurants that are far too expensive to justify where they are.,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Chicago, Illinois",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/891Susanb

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,FoodieLover91 wrote a review Oct 2011,50,Fantastic Hotel,For our first visit to Marrakesh my friend and I booked at the Sofitel Hotel. I had heard from many of my customers in England who had visited Marrakesh and stayed at the Sofitel on how wonderful a hotel it is and we too decided to book.    The hotel is nicely situated not too far from the airport and the centre. It has a fantastic presence and an elegant facade. On arrival we were warmly greeted by the receptionist (Loubna) who was very polite and professional. We arrived before check-in time due to a very early flight and were very tired having had no sleep the night before. We explained to the receptionist and she kindly allowed us to check-in so that we could freshen up. We even got a courtesy call to make sure we were happy with the room a very nice thought. The room was fantastically decorated with a Moroccan theme and lovely views over the pool area.    We were very impressed with the swimming pool area with 2 large pools and fantastically constructed sun loungers. Not the cheap plastic ones you get at some hotels. The pool area was so good it was like being in peaceful oasis of peace and relaxation away from the hustle and bustle of Marrakesh. We found the service around the pool area 1st class whenever we needed anything. There was even a guy giving free foot massages to re-energise those aching feet.  I have stayed in many 5* Hotels having travelled and worked all over the world and Sofitel Hotel in Marrakesh is definitely one of the best. I will be staying there again whenever I am back.  Overall nothing was too much trouble for the staff who went out of their way to make sure we enjoyed our stay even when my friend had forgot his comb and asked if they had one. One was promptly dispatched by Loubna.

After a flight from London I arrived at the hotel and was greeted by a friendly doorman who showed me to a comfortable sofa. A young lady came up to me and asked for my passport and of course my credit card. Whilst she was sorting out my paper work I was offered a scented towel to freshen up and a mint tea as welcoming gesture. The General Manager came up to me and introduced himself. A relaxing and much more informal way of doing business.    I arrived 1 hour before my official check in time. Rather than be told to wait I was offered a tempory room until my room was ready. Here the Sofitel exceeded in care and concern.  After an hour I went back to the reception desk and was given my room key. (Swipe card.)    The young lady who gave me my swipe card also took the trouble to explain where everything was. ( A lot more than take the lift to the third floor and turn right!!!!)    The staff are extremely polite and always say ""Bon Jour"" in a respectful way.    I would highly recommend this hotel.  You may read about the high prices but the quality is always an important factor to me    Comfortable bed nice clean room and bathroom. Great facilities.

Excellent infrastructure (heated pool!) excellent service (like in many other places in Marrakech) good food a reception area that is so inviting and a great atmoshphere. we nipped over to the El Saadi hotel next door. It has the atmosphere of a bus station!  My tip is the following:  - The building complex really consists of two hotels (the Sofitel Palais Imperial) and the Sofitel Lounge and Spa). Why spend more money getting a room in the Palais Imperial? It costs around 100-150 US dollars extra but you use the same facilities and the rooms are not much different (we stayed one night in the Palais Imperial and the rest of the time in the Lounge and Spa where the rooms are nearly of the same standard).    Try to get Meryem to help you at the reception.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,LeighHappyGirl wrote a review Sep 2011,40,A wonderful hotel,Well we're just back from a week at the Sofitel.    The beautiful reception area is typical of the rest of the hotel with a wonderful aroma and with all members of staff always willing to assist and with a warm response at any time of the day.    The rooms were a lovely size and the bed was large and extremely comfortable. Our room didn't have a particularly good view but we didn't care about it to be honest.    The pool area was extremely well looked after with plenty of sun loungers and sectioned off areas.    It takes about 15 minutes to walk to the souks and although we could have taken a taxi for a small price we enjoyed the walk.    When there during the day we ate at L'Oasis which is their poolside restaurant. The staff were always very friendly and although there wasn't a huge menu there was a good mix of salads grills and other items and the complimentary fresh bread and olives were delicious.    We are never worried about breakfast but we were aware from talking to other guests that it was very expensive and not particularly inspiring. On the occasion we wanted something we took a short walk to Extrablatt which is a cafe just a couple of minutes up the road which was ideal.    We looked at the restaurants in the hotel but there were as others have mentioned extremely expensive. Fortunately there are a number of good restaurants only a short walk from the hotel and obviously loads more the further you go into the main town. We also found the local carrefour so that we were able to have large bottles of water and snacks in our room without the excessive cost.    I looked at the prices in the spa and they were like the food over the top and I ended up going to Les Bains de Marrakech which is fabulous as well as being a great price.    During our stay there was a yearly dinner / dance party for the staff which was held at the bottom of the area where our room was. We were given notice that it was taking place on the day with apologies from the management however having a band playing very loudly from 19:00 - 00:30 in an area where guests sleep isn't ideal and it would have been nice if they had given the rooms who were disturbed by the noise something as thank you for instance a couple of drinks or a free lunch.    Two things that were were very pleasantly surprised about were that that wifi and the gym were complimentary something that was extremely welcome.    We would definitely return there again and like some of the other reviews feel the only reason why I haven't given the hotel a rating of 5 is due to the excessive prices for food and drink,Date of stay: September 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leigh-on Sea, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeighHappyGirl

We stayed in one of the hotels superior rooms which have a stunning view of the hotel's pool and Marrakech's atlas mountains.  upon arrive to the spa resort you are greeted by every member of staff you see and there is a serene calmness to the place and a relaxing aroma that makes you feel at ease.The room's were finished to a high standard like every part of the hotel.  originally we planned to spend two days here before going on a journey to to the desert for a couple of days and then upon return we would stay in a riad but the Sofitel was so breathtaking we booked an extra 3 days because we knew it would be the perfect place to relax after the desert.  The hotel is very central walking distance to the main square and plenty of restaurants in the local area.  however there are a few things which kept the hotel from receiving a 5 star rating from me. the first room we stayed in the bath was broken. at poolside the staff were in a world of their own completely ignoring people and forgetting to bring people's orders. the room service is very expensive and the quality of food doesn't match the prices sadly. we also had a problem with birds getting into the balcony and messing all over the seating area. We asked three times for it to be cleaned and it was never done! Breakfast was also a disappointment  These are the only things that stop me from giving it the full rating that i truly want to give. it was a lifetime experience and I would stay here again in a heartbeat.,Date of stay: September 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobbieS238

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Tadra wrote a review Aug 2011,30,Marrakech not so Marvelous,We ended up at this hotel by default after having spent one uncomfortable night at a Riad in the Medina. That experience is a whole other story but we were just keen to get to a decent hotel for the remainder of our long weekend stay and the Sofitel served the purpose well enough! Unlike a Riad you at least had a serviced pool area where you could escape the heat in the middle of day with a drink in hand. You get a very comfortable bed in a decent sized hotel room with working air-conditioning and room service.  I found the staff polite enough but not really very attentive to your needs. You had to stand around the pool for 10 mins or more and wave down the staff to get you a towel same too if you wanted food and drink. I would have expected in a 5 star establishment that the staff would be trained to anticipate the guests needs I don't think it acceptable to be constantly waving down the staff! Same too in the terrace bar having ordered a bottle of champagne after the bottle was delivered to the table and poured into one glass not once did they refill our glasses we had to pour our own champagne for the duration of the bottle. Again waving down the staff to order food etc. There is plenty of staff but again not using their initiative. It was quiet odd??  Anyway the hotel was a much more pleasant experience than the Riad. Riads are NOT hotels and are NOT luxurious they are simply guesthouses with few if any facilities which is not good at the height of summer.,Date of stay: August 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tadra
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Dr-B-and-Mr-B wrote a review Aug 2011,40,"Excellent hotel, with a few minor glitches along the way",The hotel facilities are excellent - wonderful foyer and entrance a range of bars and restaurants onsite boutiques calming spa etc. Finished and furnished to a very high standard. The rooms have a little less attention to detail - still reasonably luxurious but the finish was not as sleek (ours was a superior room). Beware the shower may randomly change temperature. This is a 5-star hotel that has taken the luxurious elements of the culture and integrated them. If you want a more Moroccan experience a Riad is the best way forward. It had all the elements of luxury - turning down service etc.    The service was very hit-and-miss occasionally. Drinks can take a while to arrive and you have to ask for service rather than wait for it to be offered. I found that the servers were not too obliging but you have to remember that 1) the heat slows people down 2) the culture can be very relaxed. That said at times they could come across as very rude and others very accommodating. The prices are expensive - around 5/6 pounds for a fruit juice and 8/9 pounds for a cocktail (however I think this is worth the money as they were fantastic). Expect 5-star prices. Tip - order a measure of spirit and you receive the mixer free.    We had an issue requesting a double room as a gay male couple - despite checking before we flew we were given a twin room. When we asked for a double they kept reiterating that it was a twin room as it just did not register that we wanted a double. There were other gay couples there but you cannot show affection in public for obvious reasons. I certainly felt an undercurrent of discomfort with some of the staff. Many speak English - when we spoke French they responded in English so I just stopped trying. The hotel is around a 10 min walk from the Medina.    I would stay in this hotel again but not go back to Marrakech. 5 days was enough. The 5-star standard was welcome after days in the city.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,RoadMeister71 wrote a review Aug 2011,50,Ideal for a longer stay.,If you want an authentic Maroccan experience do not go here but opt for one of the Riads in town.  If you also want to pamper yourself and have access to the best pool in town do go here.  Yes prices for drinks etc. are steep but are to be expected from a place that has a Vuitton boutique and Hermes toiletries.  We stayed with our 1.5 year old and that worked very well. Excellent baby gear and baby-sitting service can be provided by the hotel.  Management and front desk staff are terrible but the rest of the staff is good if you leave a tip now and then excellent.  Food in the restaurants is average and overpriced but there is an excellent restaurant around the corner (Table du March√©) . Up the street you can go to Comptoir Darna for upmarket Moroccan food with bellydancers (experience is worth the price not the food) and trendy lounge bar or to the good eu style caf√©.  Souks Medina and square are an easy 15 minute walk away and also the new town is very doable by foot.  All in all we were very happy that we chose this hotel.

The atmosphere is unlike anything we have previously experienced -frantic/crazy/lively/wild/noisy/ but completely intoxicating and everytime we returned to the hotel each night thinking 'thats enough' ...we were compelled to return the following evening to try it all over again. keep an eye on your money but it seems safe as anywhere else. Always approach the locals in a friendly manner and you will invariably be met with the same in return-would recommend the hotel and the marrakech experience as definitely 'a must do experience',Date of stay: August 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,near london,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NearLondonFlyingace
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,upperdeckplease wrote a review Jul 2011,40,Lovely hotel very expensive restaurant,6 of us stayed here in three superior rooms in July 2011 and we loved our stay. The staff were very helpful and friendly. As others have commented service by the pool was quite slow but they have addressed this and it seems quicker than previous comments. The prices by the pool were fairly steep (45 MAD = ¬£3.80 for a bottle of water or 60 MAD for a 330 ml Coca Cola) but they are served to your poolside chairs. The staff could not have been more helpful and laid out towels by the pool and umbrellas etc. Pool very clean and area beautifully kept by gardeners. The rooms were big with towels changed 2 or 3 times a day. Hotel restaurant (l'Orangerie) was expensive around 200 MAD for a main course. Location was excellent only a 15 minute walk to the main square and perhaps 20 minutes to the Souk. We would highly recommend the nearby restaurant the Cafe du Marche where we paid around 1100 MAD for 6 of us (we had no alcohol),Date of stay: July 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Milton Keynes, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/upperdeckplease
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,ruby1971 wrote a review Jul 2011,40,Very Nice Hotel,This is a lovely hotel in a good location.  Check in was a little slow and our room wasn't ready at 6pm however we were upgraded to a junior suite for the inconvenience.  The room was large and very well furnished with a huge terrace.Hermes toiletries are provided in the junior suites.  The public areas are beautiful.  The main pool was busy and loud but the second pool area was lovely and peaceful.  Breakfast had a good selection but service could be a little slow.  Service in the bar area was extremely poor.  My main complaint about this hotel is how expensive drinks and food was.  I expect 5 star hotels to be expensive but I still think it is massively overpriced in relation to the nightly cost of the hotel.  I visited La Mamounia whilst in marrakech and was surprised to find only a slight difference in the cost of drinks between the two hotels.,Date of stay: July 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ruby1971
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,classyluxury wrote a review Jul 2011,30,"Ridiculously expensive, ignorant staff!",We only stayed for 3 nights thank goodness otherwise we'd have needed a 2nd mortgage! It's well-situated not too close to the hustle and bustle of the city. We arrived late at night they tried to fob us off with a twin room (why would we have booked a twin room as a couple?) I was not happy at all eventually they gave in and gave us a free upgrade to a junior suite in the traditional part of the hotel. The room was nice but not amazing. It was an odd layout and there was no sink in the toilet which seems unhygienic. The bath was a bit chipped. It was nice to have Hermes products though!    The pool area was really good - really comfy double-beds and the pool was lovely. However the pool staff were really lazy and would stand around chatting. Not many people spoke English in the whole hotel which was pretty irritating - we got the impression that if you didn't speak French they didn't want to know. On the Friday we noticed a DJ setting up behind our sunbed. About 2pm he started blasting dance music. We had to shout of the pool boys (I had to shout of one of them 5 times - he was either deliberately ignoring me which wouldn't surprise me or the music was so loud he couldn't hear me) and asked him to get it turned down. The DJ reluctantly turned it down slightly and as soon as we got in the pool he turned it up again. We asked time and time again for it to be turned down. Then a group of annoying French people had their own speakers next to us and started blasting their music. Again we had to tell the pool boys to tell them to turn it down (they just kept walking past them acting like they hadn't noticed). It got to the point where we couldn't stand it anymore and I went inside and asked to speak to a manager. She did apologise and said they were trying to create a pool-party vibe. We said we could understand that if we were in Miami (which we've been to and thoroughly enjoyed - it's not that we're party-poopers) but not this hotel! We also said 2pm is far too early for that and also told her about how poor the pool staff were. She said she would take that on board.    We went out that evening and I asked the same manager if she could get us a hotel taxi (no way was I getting in one of the local tin-can taxis again!) and we waited for ages for it. She told one of the men outside to get it for us so we followed him and he tried putting us in a local taxi. I was really annoyed that we'd waited for ages when we could have just walked out and done that ourselves she just made the excuse that English wasn't her first language. We finally got a hotel taxi (¬£25!!!). The driver was actually really good and guided us to the rhiad we would have otherwise struggled to find.    The biggest problem with this hotel is the cost. It is extortionate! Breakfast is ¬£25 each - we ended up going to Le Table Du Marche around the corner which was OK (not that much cheaper really). Lunch ended up being really expensive e.g. Beef kebabs were ¬£25 a can of coke was nearly a fiver. We aren't cheapskates but it really ruined our enjoyment as we had to constantly check how much things were. There were also no shops nearby so you couldn't just go out and buy some cans and bring them back - there was no room in the fridges anyways.    I wouldn't recommend this hotel unless you don't mind being ignored and ripped off!,Date of stay: July 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,manchester,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/classyluxury

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,TravelDoctor1 wrote a review Jul 2011,20,Don't stay here. Period.,"I don't even know where to start. I'm ctually here now for one more night and I'm trying to find a way to check out early due to the lack of service here.    First the good things so I'm not completely bashing the place. We are in a superior room so the size and location are nice. Also the size of the pool and lounge searing are plentiful and relaxing. Ok. That's about it.    Reasons why I wouldn't recommend this place to anybody:    - when we came to check in we got here early at 1230. They didn't have a room ready Whig was understandable since check in is at 3. But the manager came out and said that we can have lunch and come back as our rooms would be ready at ""3"". When 3 came around they didn't have rooms ready so my husband asked for the manager- they stalled and finally he came out and said ""remember I said 3 or later"". First off she didn't say that and neither does our hotel confirmation. They ended up scurrying and giving us the first 2 rooms that were ready (we are a party of 3).    Second= the pool was amazing. And the fact that they had a spa was the reason we chose this hotel amongst the Riyadhs. I love going into the spa at night or when it starts to get cooler. Oh don't get me started- this spa was a good size and appeared as a spa with the signs that sai no children and it appeared that there were jets for bubbles- but the spa was the same temperature as the pool at ALL times. We asked the staff to turn on the bubbles and heat and they turned on the bubbles for 3-5 minutes which it would automatically turn off. It NEVER got warm. When we asked about the heat they said that they only heat it up in the winter. The next day we were in the spa and it was cooler and other people were asking for heat- we asked for the manager and the same one from the day before came out with her greeting as ""remember meeeeee?"". I didn't know how to read her obnoxious comment but after asking her for the heat she flat out said no and that the spa does not have the ability to be heated. I find. This hard to believe since the last guy said they only heat it in the winter. I don't like being lied to. Then she said assured me that all jacuzzis are cold basically calling me crazy. I decide to not use the facility anymore and go back to the room about 10 minutes later. She apparently was watching me and came running after me offering access foe 2 of our 3 guests access to their spa where they have a hot tub. I thought that it was rude that she would split up our party even after I mentioned we were a party of 3 adults. Then she offered me to go to the managers bar and have a drink and ""think about it"". Thy was my last straw. Alcohol or unlomited soft drinks is not going to change how I feel to split up my party. Also there were kids in the spa the entire time- I have wonderful picture of it I will display when I get to the states.    Next complaint is very few people here speak English or Arabic for that matter. French is the main language. We attempted to call the concierge to find out how to retrieve phone messages. We got transferred to housekeeping the restaurant and the spa just because nobody speaks English. When we finally retrieved our phone message it was my family expressing concern whether I was even there. They had a difficult time reaching our room- A half hour on their dime. For a 5 star hotel they should have somebody who speaks english available at all times.    Lastly I'm having breakfast now that's costing an arm and a leg for a Buffett when I know I am not going to eat that much. They told me to go to the cafe terrace as I can order a la carte. I walked there with my friend and the staff were talking to their friends for a good 5 minutes before helping us. We looked at their pastries on display in their glass case which I will post a picture of- and the pastries were SWARMED with bees (which I'm allergic). When somebody came to help us I asked what was on their menu an they mentioned the pastries- I asked the ""ones in there with the bees on it???"". Her reply was simple ""if that bothers you I can go to the kitchen and get you another one."". Really?????? Gross! Definitely not 5 star quality.    Needless to say I'm unhappy with this hotel. I've jotted down the general manager's name and will be writing a detailed letter as soon as I get home. Their managers are worthless so I'm hoping he may he a tad bit better. Whatever you do- avoid this hotel at all costs - you're wasting your money.",Date of stay: July 2011,,"Upland, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelDoctor1

Very attentive staff.,"We went to this hotel in November to celebrate a special birthday and I'm very glad we did. Only a 15 minute walk from Jemaa el Fnaa square and most of the other attrractions this was very conveniently located. The rooms were large with one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in and the decor and atmosphere of the hotel was lovely. From the moment you enter into the hotel lobby with its rose scented fountain and your welcoming glass of mint tea served by silk turban clad waiters you feel as if you are somewhere special. The pool area is beautiful with intermittent ""fountains"" in one of the two large pools and an array of different sun bathing possibilities; hammocks big double beds four posters and the usual suns loungers. Towels are brought to you by the kaftan wearing attendants and are on hand for a drink from the bar. The only thing I would complain about is the bar area which lacked atmosphere and was expensive. There was entertainment in the form of a group one night but it finished rather early and the bar became empty as a result.

We arrived and our room could not be ready before a few hours. Since we have a baby and could not wait too long in the lobby they offered us a room in the palais imperial which was ready immediately. We agreed but upon arriving to the room it turned out to be a street view room with a lot of noise from the street and some works going on in the area. We called the reception and complained. They said that the hotel is fully booked and it is very difficult to find us another room. But my wife went to the lobby and told them that it was uncomfortably noisy for the baby. The manager Hayat was extremely helpful and she managed to upgrade us to a Junior suite with pool view. Very quiet and enough space for a couple with a child. This has really made a big difference and made our stay very enjoyable.  The breakfast buffet was great a large selection of excellent European and Moroccan food. The staff are so smiley professional helpful and genuine: all of them. We felt at home all the time.  The pools are very nice and there are enough ""beds"" around to sit down and sun bath. The spa is very nice too with a hammam. The most important thing about this hotel is that whatever you need the staff will help you and if you buy or eat things the price is not a rip-off like it is usually in other hotels.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,MoodyBas wrote a review May 2011,30,Great looking hotel / service sloppy,Sofitel Lounge and Spa is very close to the limited sights of Marrakesh ‚Äì walking distance or a ¬£5.00 cab. It is a great looking hotel in the international style with a Moroccan twist. Perhaps 15 minutes by cab from the airport. It is located on Marrakesh‚Äôs park lane if you will and there are some good restaurants and cafes nearby (head to Caf√© Blatt for breakfast Comptoir for supper with belly dancers at circa 22.00 but if a man alone or with other guys be aware that you may subtlety be set up with a working girl by the house ‚Äì all quite charming but not for free) and night clubs. The Hotel Hivernage restaurant is great and less expensive than the others.    The Sofitel itself -    We asked for twice and waited twenty minutes for a menu at the terrace bar ‚Äì it never came we got up and left. The very important wake-up call requested and agreed the night before never came a porter telephoned for - never came. Nothing in terms of service is ‚Äòquite right‚Äô minibar not refilled ‚Äì and it would have been used by us. Put simply Sofitel really miss a trick with this one ‚Äì so much more money would be spent in the hotel if they could just get the service right. When the wakeup call issue was discussed with the desk those behind it entered into an argument amongst themselves with no apology I just walked away ‚Äì really not what you expect in this class of hotel.    Very irritatingly you need to approach a pool attendant to get a towel for a lounger and even if you request a menu one might never come (the only time I requested a menu from a pool attendant it simply never arrived the attendant more interested in chatting up five Moroccan girls - I don‚Äôt blame a young guy for it but he should attend to business first). Sometimes it is a struggle to get anything done in this hotel ‚Äì and at this level it isn‚Äôt on.    The hotel is certainly clean and tidy and credit must be given to the maids who clearly do an excellent job. The bar / restaurant prices are western five star ‚Äì five star deluxe. Indoor pool and ‚Äòspa‚Äô which is only a hammam and a sauna is ¬£25.00 each per visit (massages etc. are extortionate; you would think you were at the Paris Ritz). Generally the hotel is full of rich Moroccans (who from what I encountered have a rather imperious attitude when it comes to service which isn‚Äôt pleasant to watch) doing business and loafing around loads of French and a few Brits.    The hotel not considering the service is five star by any standard Louis Vuitton boutique a jewellers etc the pools and gardens are beautiful (the heated pool really is very warm at all times) and the nightclub is like something from Scarface ‚Äì very cool.  For the money ‚Äì we paid ¬£1700 Inc. flights for two from London for five nights it is just OK I would probably try somewhere else next time but that is reflective of the service and not the quality of the hotel or room itself.,Date of stay: April 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,LondonBas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MoodyBas

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,bahamasviking wrote a review Apr 2011,40,"Not a 5 star, but there's something to be said for large hotels",Other reviewers have summed it up - perfectly good hotel but not a 5*. Lighting in the rooms was dim the bath amenities don't include body lotion service in the lounge/bar is inattentive at best. There were also a lot of bees around which happens when there are gardens but it wasn't reassuring to see them buzzing around inside the food display cases and the staff doing nothing about it.    Our room was fine - a long walk from the entrance but quiet and comfortable enough. We were in the Moroccan wing - so the room had a little bit of flair and a nice little balcony overlooking the pool. One odd thing was how the bathroom was split up - right when you enter the room there was a toilet bowl in a narrow dark room on the left then you went through a small hallway with closets then you were in the bedroom and the bath/shower and sink were off the bedroom (i.e. not connected to the room with the toilet). Not bad just different although it would have been nice to have a sink in with the toilet too. The rooms in the other wing may have had a more standard layout. We got at least one English TV channel.    We never ate breakfast at the hotel we instead walked either a block over to the Extrablatt or ate at La Table du Marche across the street both of which were a better value than the Sofitel. It was an easy walk into the Medina and nice to be out of the insanity. The public areas of the hotel are indeed spectacular. We didn't try the casino.    While a riyadh would certainly have more charm one thing to keep in mind is that many of them (at least ones we researched) required at least a 30% non-refundable deposit (ouch). With the Sofitel we could have cancelled with no penalty a day or so before which is nice to know if your travel plans aren't set in stone. It's also nice to have your taxi drop you (and your luggage) right off at the hotel's entrance. Also in a large anonymous hotel you don't have to share breakfast with the people you heard in the room next door the night before....,Date of stay: January 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Washington, DC",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bahamasviking

The common areas are beautiful and the service great. Check-in was relatively quick and they bring you hot towels and tea while doing the paperwork. They provide l'Occitane toiletries a nice touch.    My complaints are minor but the point is that there shouldn't be any complaints about a 5* hotel. The hotel is large and the first time I stayed there my garden room was about a mile from the reception area. The room was very nice but we requested a baby crib and could barely squeeze it into the room and I could swear that what they actually gave us was a laundry cart with a mattress in the bottow. It was so deep it was nearly impossible to lean in to get the baby out!    My second stay was just this month and I had a 3rd floor room. The bed was extremely comfortable and I got the best sleep I've gotten in ages. But the room itself was pretty blah with all-purpose carpet and plain rather thin bathtowels. In a 5* hotel I expect little things like the bath towels to be nicer than what I have at home.

After letting us wait for about a half an hour the room was 'ready' and the VISA problems were solved. Once in our room we checked the minibar and noticed that it was not completely filled. Also the shower gel in the bathroom had already been used. Some small problems we could life with... But when I decided to take a shower the real problems began. After about 5 minutes in the shower the bathroom was flooded by water and the water temperature was changing all the time. On our second night we arrived in our room @ 20h45 and we noticed that the room hadn't been serviced. The beds weren't made up the towels hadn't been replaced ... So we went to the reception to notice the problems but the lady at the reception just gave us an extra key for our room (???). Thats also a real problem: there is some staff that can speak English but most of them only speak a little French (but even in French they don't always understand you). After explaining the problem in English AND french they told us they would send someone to our room. So we waited again for about 45 minutes till someone arrived. He told us the lady of the housekeeping had already left the hotel so he made up the bed. We told him the room was messy and needed some cleaning so he left the room and after again a half an hour he came back with another guy. They cleaned the bathroom and put roses in the bathtube (to please us I think..) But they didn't vacuum the room (photo) didn't clean the closets ... So we called the supervisor and she did appologize for it and she promised to deal with all the problems the day after. The 3rd day the room was clean but the shower still wasn't fixed and on the bed the bed linen was worn out (photo) and the bathrobe was dirty (photo). I can go on like this forever with all the small problems that make this hotel not worth it's 5 stars! Also the price for breakfast and drinks is really too high. 25 euro for a breakfast?! In the city you can have a really good one for about 2 euro!  So to conclude the hotel really has to do something about the quality of the rooms the speed of the service and the language knowledge of its staff otherwise they will have to deal with a lot more of negative comments in the future I suppose...  It has to be said that Sofitel tries to keep its name high by sending appology mails saying they will deal with the problems or by giving us some biscuits and slippers. But that's not the way you treat unhappy customers! Just give them some biscuits and they will shut up?

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Carly Brad wrote a review Mar 2011,40,Lush hotel with fantastic pool area but felt uncomfortable at times,The hotel is beautiful this goes without saying. Staff were welcoming upon arrival and greeted us with hot towels. Speedy check in service and went straight to the room with no problems. Baggage took a bit of time but can expect this when arriving in the evening.  Room was lovely. Comfortable beds and very spacious with towels provided and bath robes and slippers provided.  Didn't use mini bar due to how expensive the items were. Worth buying a bottle or two at the airport before you depart as alcohol in Marrakech is very expensive and very limited.  Had breakfast the 1st morning in the hotel but very expensive and not much choice. ¬£20 per person and orange juice is limited. Not available to help yourself - all waiter service.  Found some lovely restaurants within walking distance from the hotel. One called Extrablatt which is across from the hotel on the right hand side past the Novotel Suites. Very reasonable prices open at 8am in the morning and close late in the evenings. Had breakfast every morning here and an evening meal on the first night. It's almost as if it's the TGI's of Marrakech! Staff very welcoming and quick service.  Another restaurant we visited was around the corner from the hotel. Attached to a hotel so served alcohol at reasonable cost. I wasn't best pleased with my meal so I complained and didnt have to pay - however my friends meal looked reasonable so don't rule this one out based on my opinion!  A lovely Thai Restaurant just up from ExtraBlatt. This is highly recommended and food was stunning. A lot of choice bit more expensive but food was good quality. We booked in the day which is also recommended as it gets busy past 8pm.  Weather wasn't the best. We stayed for 4 nights 4 days and we only got one day good sunny weather. Rained a lot (still fairly warm) and cooler at night so cardigans/jackets are a must! Rainy season is end of November through to March so be prepared!  Took walks daily. Everyday we seemed to end up somewhere different. New town in Marrakech was ok. Some shops like Zara and Etam but not much more. Lots of cafes to sit at though to people watch which is always good if your a nosey person like me!  Took a Marrakech Bus Tour on one day as well. These come in either 24 or 48 hour passes - would only reccommend 24 hour pass otherwise you will just end up wasting your money. We felt we managed to get around most of Marrakech in a day.  We didn't however do the Mountains but got told it was a trek on the coach their and back for only an hours stay so we didn't bother.  Overall the hotel and staff were lovely. However we did feel uncomfortable at times walking through this hotel as Tourists as this hotel was more aimed at Business. Lots of business men and women and very expensive for food and drinks but made us want to venture out more which was good.  Pool area fantastic. Comfy beds and towels available throughout the day. One warm and one cold pool. Not many families. Mainly couples/group holiday/business.  Overall hotel lovely with casino attached to the side but wouldnt go back only because of the cost when you are there.,Date of stay: March 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Derby,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carlinder
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Awaywegoagain22 wrote a review Mar 2011,50,A truly luxurious stay,This is a very good 5* hotel attentive staff and very good service. Certainly an air of luxury and a high ratio of extremely helpful staff. Check in was very smooth we arrived at mid day and shown to our room straight away. If I stayed here again I would request a room with a pool view the garden view rooms had a view of the back of the hotel which was a dumping ground for old furniture and carpet making our balcony unusable. The bedroom was nicely furnished and the bed linen of a good quality. Room service delivery was very prompt. I would not recommend eating at the pool restaurant very poor value for money. Breakfast is also very expensive have coffee and croissant on the verandah much better  value and lovely views of the pool and garden. The pool area was excellent with very comfortable sun loungers/beds with staff always willing to set up your bed for you. I enjoyed my stay here and would certainly return.,Date of stay: March 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Awaywegoagain22
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,LondonCarolyn wrote a review Feb 2011,40,Ideal in every way,Out of all the 5 star hotels we viewed in Marrakech this was the most geared up for families. It was light and airy unlike the other dark and mysterious 5 star hotels so we feel we made a great choice. There is a lot of walking to be done none the least from reception to our bedroom (at least 6 or 7 minutes). However the bedroom had black out curtains and was silent therefore we had fantastic deep long sleeps in very comfy beds.  The Sofitel is located just outside the main walls of the Medina even so a steady 15 minute walk to get to the main square which is the only place to congregate at night unless you have chosen to go to a restaurant elsewhere in the City. There was no service or area of the hotel that let itself down we were very impressed with the service and friendliness of the staff at all levels. It was a great relief at breakfast to be attended to the instant you sit down and the hot drink of your choice bought within seconds. I usually hate buffet breakfasts in hotels all that running around looking at various stations searching for cups and spoons bowls and eggs. The breakfasts are expensive with not the widest range but the foods available were available in various different formats i.e. fruit came in fruit puree fruit slices fruit smoothie fruit pressee fruit yoghurt fruit fool etc. The eggs came in 10 different ways. On saying that the eggs also came via crepes and pancakes. There were various cereals some cold meats and cheeses and many varieties of yoghurts breads and cakes.  There are two swimming pools in the grounds - one heated during the winter months. The exterior grounds were fantastic palms and plants hammocks huge 4 poster sunbeds and loungers - it was beautiful plus pool towels on tap. There was a kids club should parents choose to use which had everything they could desire and well attentive carers who seemed fascinated by the children. They were having the best time. My only disappointment if there has to be one was the bar area outside in the evening. There was a lack of service along with a lack of atmosphere (although the weather was not too warm to be hanging around outside) and the extremely expensive cocktails that finally arrived after huge long waits did not seem worth it. They also came with a lot of sugar involved which is kind of strange but then they like to use a lot of sugar in most of their dishes (check their teeth in Morocco!). Thankgoodness for the gym which is free to use and although not huge selection of equipment there to use it was definitely a bonus. And lastly outside in the hotel front gardens they have electric go karts for the kids to use which was kind of cool. The stay at the sofitel really completed our holiday worthwhile.,Date of stay: February 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LondonCarolyn

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,LeePyle wrote a review Feb 2011,50,Faultless !,I find it very strange that people can critisize anything about this hotel.    Everything was faultless from the time of arrival to departure - yes the costs are quite high but then again you are in a 5* hotel.    If you work out that a pint of lager comes in at around ¬£15 and a semi-decent bottle of red wine is over ¬£70.    I would recommend this to anyone and would go back again without fail.    Staff cant do enough for you are always polite and even though English isnt in their top 3 or 4 languages they will still get someone to help any situation.    Only downside - if you are eating in the 'disco restaurant' - make sure you book a table - bcos all of the local money bags are there Fridays and Saturdays - unlike us who turned up and expected as a guest to have a table ! :-) ................. and ......... the staff still made room for us !

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,John K wrote a review Jan 2011,20,A Mismanaged Mess,This hotel looks like the discarded leftovers of a W property. The bed was inattentively painted a tacky silver and the room was cramped and dull.    We called for a box to have some of our accumulated souvenirs sent home; after 3 or 4 separate phone calls to different staff members each of whom assured us they'd send a box right over we never got our box. On one of those calls the staff member mentioned that the hotel did not offer a mailing service but that he would be contacting a third party to come get our stuff and would call us back. He never did. We left early the next morning and had to find some temporary packing material at the airport to get our stuff safely on the plane. Fortunately an airport baggage-wrapper attendant was far more helpful than the Sofitel and shockingly our souvenirs survived 2 connections back to the United States.    The room service food was really poor but the hotel wasn't all bad: the Sofitel luggage-handlers and doormen couldn't have been more gracious. Sofitel would be better off letting them run the hotel than such an uncaring and inept front desk.    There are many better hotels and riads at which to stay in Marrakech.,Date of stay: January 2011,,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jhkester
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Biztraveller74 wrote a review Jan 2011,30,Lovely pool and garden!! umm.. that's it really...,I chose this hotel on the recommendation of a friend who had stayed there in the summer. He raved about it so we decided it was worth a go however it seemed we did not have the same experience. All in all its a very beautiful hotel with a stunning pool area which is well kept and offers plenty of large sun loungers which were very comfortable and more like outside beds. The gardens are lovely and there is also a relaxing terrace however as we were there in December we only got to make use of the pool and gardens on the first day after that it was too cold or too wet. The weather played a big part in our enjoyment at the hotel which is obviously not their fault.  The rooms were nice and the beds are extremely comfortable. Service is so so check-in seemed to take forever and overall attitude was ok but better if you could speak French. We noticed a big difference in how they treated French speakers over others. Breakfast was ok lots of lovely fresh fruit but some of the hot items were awful. One tip - avoid the lunch buffet its very expensive and not worth the money.  The Location was not bad a bit of a walk into the old town but not too far. There are also a small selection of very good restaurants a short walk from the hotel including Comptoir and La Villa which were both excellent.  The Spa was very nice a little expensive but this is to be expected.  Biggest complaint was the smoking! The reception was smokey and the bar was so bad we could only manage one overpriced drink. I guess in the summer more people are outside so its ok but as it was very cold everyone was indoors.  I was a little underwhelmed but all in all its a good hotel maybe not a true 5* standard but if you are looking for a nice pool then this is the one. I hated Marrakech with a passion and will never go back but this hotel is a little oasis.,Date of stay: December 2010,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Biztraveller74

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,BizFamMan wrote a review Dec 2010,40,Glitzy hotel with excellent food!,When we arrived as this hotel that first thing we noticed was the Lamborghini's and Ferrari's parked outside and upon entering we were quickly ushered to a seat and served Mint tea while the super attentive staff checked us in and filled out the forms on our behalf. The pool area is very attractive and really does look great with an unlimited number of seating/bed/hammock options in or out of the shade. Attendants wait poolside to meet your every demand and deliver a cold beer without you having to move a muscle.    The food we had both for breakfast and dinner really was top notch if not a little over fussy with the amuse-bouche at dinner maybe. The Veal Tagine really was the best we'd ever eaten!    One thing we noted was that everyone around us seemed to have a lot of money be very well dressed and we even ran into a few famous faces. So remember to pack your glad rags as you will certainly feel like you need them!    If you don't feel like splashing out in the restaurant then we would recommend eating in the bar (not well advertised) ask and they will get you almost anything - we enjoyed a bowl of fries on our last night so that we could fit in the buffet breakfast.    Be warned that the constant presence of hotel staff can be a little overbearing (the only safe place being your hotel room) and not everyone's cup of tea.    Avoid the modern part of Marrakesh as its bland and underwhelming but the old town is fantastic and full of culture (but perhaps don't wear those hot pants - generally muslins aren't overly keen of displays of nakedness!).,Date of stay: December 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"West Bridgford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BizFamMan

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,CocktailKate wrote a review Nov 2010,50,"Absolutly Beautiful, Truley deserves it's 5 star status....",I am a travel agent who travelled here with a friend and colluege for a weekend break We travelled with the tour opertor soverigne and as we pulled up in our luxury car we were blown away by the Sofitel the entrance is on to remember! Stunning water fountain surrounded by lovely looking and smelling rose bushes.  A red carpet sweeps the steps and as you arrive The door men are there to take you suitcases and open the doors. Never did a day go by without any member of staff not greeting you as they walked passed. The customer service at this hotel is amazing!  When checking in we were offered a seat and given hot towles and traditional morrocan mint tea which is stunning. The concierge at the hotel made him self aware to us and if you have any needs this is they person to talk to he can organise meals out from tradition morrocan to a 5 star al a carte resturant. A variety of Excurisons Senic walks tours Ask and he will get you an answer.  After waiting we were shown to our room we stayed in the traditional side of the hotel and the room was out of this world! We had room 279 overlooking the stunning pools and gardens. The room had two huge beds with the most comfortable matress and pillows i have ever slept on!! A couch tucked away in the corner with a lovely window with little doors we also had a balcony with a table and chairs on which was a delight to sit on and sip on a glass of champage as we watched the world go by. The bathroom was stunning with traditional orange colours We had a bath with shower over head which was very powefull and perfect tempreture! Towls re stocked daily and fresh rose petals scattered on the floor it was such a magic touch!  There was complimentry bath robes and slippers to use through out our stay which was very usefull as we forgot our own!  We were booked onto bed and breakfast basis you can choose from english to morrocan to burber to continental breakfasts so plenty to choose from and explore morrocan food Every item cooked to perfection! Freshy squeezed orange juice is free flowing as is tea and coffee you can choose to sit inside or outside on the amazing terrece over looking the pool and gardens.  We ate just once in the hotels resturant which was very resonable priced - Over negative comments about the hotel being expencive its a 5 star hotel with 5 star customer service 5 star food so you truley do get what you pay for!  We ate in the orange resturant which cost ¬£60 per person for a main course a dessert and a bottle of wine (bareing in mind we had one of the expencive bottles) so very very resonable!! The food was stunning! We had Lamb cooked with rosmary and caramilised onions! Outstanding.  This hotel also offers room service which again is resonable priced very nice and very quick to get to your room.  The staff at the hotel work really hard to please every single customer that walks though the door the customer service here exceeds expectations.  We tipped most staff around 20-50 dirhams a time which is 2-4 pounds We tipped a bit more for staff members who truley did something special for our stay.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,WanderingProfessor wrote a review Nov 2010,30,Many problems,I agree with most of the reviews. This hotel has many problems to solve. First night I was given a very noisy room on the street. I complained to reception's staff that obviously did not care. After many trips to reception I was finally given another room quieter and better located. It took lots of complaining even if I belong to Aclub and was a waste of time.  It is true that the pool area is great with beds and hammocks. The gym is interesting the spa is very nice and relaxing. Yet everything is very expensive and the staff is pretty much useless. Marrakech is a great city to discover but not ready for tourism. Be prepared to lose lots of money with taxis who will rob you sometimes with the help of the hotel staff. The concierge is clueless and obviously gets commission from the places he sent you to. All in all avoid this hotel. Not worthy of Sofitel brand and it seems there are better options in the Riads.,Date of stay: October 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"The Hague, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WanderingProfessor
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Ansiscool wrote a review Nov 2010,40,"Perfect location, beautiful hotel.",Hotel was gorgeous. There are two pools - one mainly used by families and the other was pure peace and quiet. The sun loungers were amazing - loads of huge double bed ones hammocks (even cot style ones for babies!) The weather was fantastic (travelled in the first week of November.) Our room was fantastic brand new with great bath products and maids that never woke us up with banging doors or demands to clean our room!    Bad points - it is outrageously expensive. We booked through expedia and got a great room only deal but the cost of eating and drinking is madness. We had breakfast there on our first morning and it cost us ¬£25 each for a buffet. Drinks are ¬£4 for a can of coke or small bottle of water. ¬£13 for a glass of red wine. I could go on! The service is also really hit and miss but as we now realise that is par for the course throughout Marrakech.    Location is fantastic. The hotel is in a swish and safe area of Marrakech a perfect distance away from the stress and hassle of the Medina. There is a great cafe 50m down the road from the hotel which does fab breakfasts and lunches which are really reasonably priced. When we fancied a glass of wine in the evening before bed we headed to the Novotel next door for a ¬£10 bottle of red.    As has been said before negotiate all prices for taxis before you get in / let them take your bags. 150Dh max to and from the airport. 30Dh max to and from Le Place. If anyone tells you that they are 'official' guides and show you a pass be aware that they can buy these passes in the medina! The best way for us to find our bearings was jumping on the open top red tourist bus that stops outside the hotel and which the hotel staff will flag down for you.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Bruce W wrote a review Oct 2010,50,Very nice but ...,A spectacular hotel with luxurious and extremely spacious public areas including a huge poolside lounging area. The hotel location was for us ideal - within easy walking distance of the medina but just outside the medina walls and beyond the hassle. Our room was large and comfortable but not the best location - overlooking a delivery bay and moped/motorcycle parking lot. The walls were thin enough to share (for the last two nights) the delights of staying with a family with what sounded like like half a dozen hyperactive children in the next room. The service was mostly friendly but sometimes very inefficient - one bar-tender slowly preparing drinks orders collected by half a dozen waiters. Prices for food and drink are at Parisian levels. A couple of tips - breakfast on the terrace at the modern Cafe Extrablatt on the right three minutes walk up the street leading to the front of the hotel is good and about one tenth of the price of the hotel breakfast. The Table Du Marche restaurant in the Hivernage hotel (turn right out of the Sofitel and walk three minutes) is much better than and a bit cheaper than the Sofitel's only evening dining option.    down the street in leading to the front of the hotel,Date of stay: October 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Beckenham,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdwardkBeckenham

There is a doorman outside and ocasionaly you may have to walk trough the security area and have your bag checked. I didn't mind but I didn't expect it since Marocco is not really considered to be under terrorist threats. But there is nothing wrong with an extra security meassure. The check-in went smoothly the entire staff is very well dressed and everything looks very posh. Most of them speak french and understand english. The room was very specious and had a balcony. My room faced a backyard however The rooms on the other side would have a much better view. There is a garden and a swimming pool. One evening I ordered a room service which was brought in prompty and tasted excellent. The surrounding area and the city itself is quite boring but the hotel made it worth for me to visit. If it wasn't for the great hotel I would have been pretty disappointed. I also wrote to the hotel after my stay regarding the frequent flyer points which I didn't receive and I soon received a phone call from the manager apologizing. He said he would forward my claim to their head office in Paris...but oh well the french weren't bothered to look into the matter so I never got it. But I appreciated the effort on the Manager's part. All in all the hotel is a fantastic choice for people who like to relax and a get the same or even better treatment than in any other country in the same climatic area and of course pay a lot less.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,CADLondon wrote a review Oct 2010,30,Beautiful Hotel & Pool with average service,This hotel is around 15 minutes walk from the Mdina but it's not a pleasant walk. The hotel and grounds are beautiful. If you want to lounge around a pool this is the place. It has two large pools with sun beds and loungers better than anywhere else I've stayed. The room (we had a superior room on the ground floor) was rather small but fine. The public bar area is lovely - candlelit at night and very relaxing.    And there's the rub. You need to relax here because the service is not fast. We found the staff generally very friendly and helpful taking your order but everything took about 30 minutes to arrive. This included tea for breakfast lunch by the pool the restaurant and the bar area. It became very frustrating.    The other problem is the ridiculously high prices at the hotel. Small beer ¬£6. Water by the pool ¬£4. Chicken sandwich ¬£18.00. Oh and don't eat in the restaurant - it looks and is very nice but the food is average and vastly overpriced. We paid ¬£100 for over-cooked duck with sodden vegetables and about ¬£30 for vin ordinaire.    It's a pity that Sofitel don't bring their prices down to a reasonable (albeit) 5 star level and teach their staff about good and fast customer service. They'd make a much larger profit if they did.

The main thing which is really disappointing about this hotel is the ridiculous prices of everything.  - pringles from the mini bar ¬£4  - local beer bottle at the pool (¬£6) -our advice ask a taxi driver to take you to the supermarket and by the same beer for less than ¬£1 a bottle and just 'store them' away.  - Club sandwich -¬£15  -Hamman for 2 people (¬£100)-get a taxi driver to Hilton Hamman 5mins away and pay ¬£40 for a hamman and massage.    It is really frustrating as you like to have 'pool 'days but are really reluctant to buy any food or drink. We had to buy stuff locally and snack in the room.    If you want luxury quite close to the medina (10-15minute walk) it is great. However either be prepared to spend ALOT of money at the hotel or not be able to enjoy any drinks/snacks by the pool or in the evening- rip off really sums it up.,Date of stay: August 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amyrack2
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,RuthandKesh wrote a review Aug 2010,50,Excellent facilities would definately reccommend this hotel,Excellent hotel and facilities with luxurios pool area. The service is exellent and the staff very friendly. It should be noted that only use of the gym is included in the price of the room and use of any other facilities (in-door pool steam room sauna) comes at an additional cost. Though the brochure says it is paces from the main square it is in fact about 15 minutes walk. Food and drinks are quite expensive but there are good eating places within a couple of minutes walk from the hotel. Even after taking these factors in to account we would still reccomend this hotel as it is excellent value for money.,Date of stay: August 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cromer, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RuthandKesh

I am not exactly a world traveler but my wife and I leave the US at least once a year for vacation. We had never been to Morocco and I had never been to North Africa. i don't speak Arabic or French so we were counting on some help in the form of a pick-up upon our arrival. The Sofitel assured us multiple times that a driver would be waiting when we disembarked in Marrakech. Well there was no one waiting. That forced me to try and find a phone to call the hotel. Not an easy task. finally the Budget rent-a-car guy took pity on me and called them for me. after getting transferred twice and hung-up on once i was told to ""stay right there."" Btw - every other arriving passenger seemed to get picked up including La Mamounia ( the nice hotel where we should have stayed ) who's drivers were waiting at the gate in uniform. finally our guy arrives sweating profusely. his fez was askew. he apologizes. keep in mind as we later learned the hotel is literally ten minutes from the hotel. it's not like he had to cross the desert. anyway we get to the hotel and sat for an hour during the check-in process. finally we are sent to a room with a stained carpet and chair a broken toilet paper dispenser and no working a-c. this will not do. so we complained. they moved us to another room on the fourth floor which was apparently being renovated. so we walked through the hall to find all other rooms on the floor with their doors wide open carpets ripped up and mattresses lining the halls. it looked like the overlook hotel from that movie ""the shining"" on the last day of the season. it took us threatening to leave to finally be assigned to a decent room. just an awful experience. the Sofitel really has to get it's act together. the Marrakech experience permanently soured me on the brand. not to mention how much money they charged for breakfast. for those prices these guys need to step it up. I don't mean to be nasty. I tried to focus my ire at them on an internal company survey but predictably it didn't work properly.

We arrived at 10 am and had to wait until 1 pm to get into our rooms. The staff were pleasant enough but some refused to speak French saying they only speak English (with a thick accent and broken grammar) even though some members of our group speak French as a first language.    The business center is terrible. A very hot room slow computers with a poor internet connection. The printer did not work. Unacceptable for such an expensive hotel. BUY a NEW PRINTER. You have a multi-million dollar hotel and can't afford a $200 printer?    The hotel is quite nice but the rooms are a little plain for a 5 star hotel. Also depending on where your room is you may have to walk a long distance to the elevator and then to your room. Very long hallways to some rooms. Quite a bit of noise from the street outside but likely all hotels in the area will be the same.    Location is fairly close to the Souk market.    Beware of hustlers outside the hotels who will start talking to you offer to show you around and claim to work at the hotel - saying ""you don't remember me because I am not in my uniform.""

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Teresa U wrote a review Aug 2010,40,Great experience but the food/drinks are too overpriced,We had a wonderful time at the Sofitel. The pool area was beautiful and the lounge area was very relaxing. A bottle of water cost 50 Dirhams compared to 5 outside the hotel. So you can just imagine how overpriced the hotel food was. We never had breakfast here because it would cost 23euros for just coffee/orange juice and bread. If you cross the street to the Cafe of the Table de Marche you can eat there (although I did get pretty bad food poisoning I'm still recovering from after eating scrambled eggs) or walk two blocks north to another cafe next to Comptoir.

The public areas in the hotel are fabulous lots of lovely seating areas and attentive staff. By the pool there were various types of sun lounger/beds hammocks etc for relaxing. Breakfast was lovely with plenty of staff to attend to your needs and a wide range of food available - the freshly squeezed grapefruit juice was just delicious!! On a down side the price of food and drink was hideous - ¬£4 for a can of coke!! My tip is to buy bottles of drink in the medina at 40p and take back to the hotel though if you put them into room fridge make sure you arent charged for items from the mini bar as we were. Our room was a little tired looking the shower leaked air conditioning was not efficient in the 40 degree heat and there were no tea/coffee making facilities. There was some building work on the floor above ours so there was constant banging and tapping all day. Another tip is to visit the cafe 2 mins down the road for very reasonably priced lunch snacks.,Date of stay: August 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Taunton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clairej73
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Travelinstyle1987 wrote a review Aug 2010,50,A fantastic experience,The Sofiel is luxurious. The staff were so friendly and made us feel very welcome. An oasis of calm in a bustling and in July very hot city. As a family (with older teenagers) in Marrakech for a week we knew that we would not be able to afford to eat at the hotel. The patisserie 'La Table du Marche' at the Hivernage Hotel provided our breakfast and snacks. The 'Cafe ExtraBlatt' serves western food and was useful but the food stalls at Djemma el Fna are cheap and suit a wide variety of tastes.  We visited sights each morning - taxis when required were very easy to use - walked in to the Souks which took no more than 15 mins - it got very hot in the afternoon. This was our opportunity to relax around the swimming pool. The pool staff were friendly and always helpful. A plate of fruit and some ice cold drinks (and a cold swimming pool) were very welcome. The atmosphere created is one of calm and relaxation. Much needed before we headed out in the evening. Djemma el Fina comes alive - storytellers belly dancers snake charmers - hustle and bustle. Watch out when you take a photo - a snake a monkey or a hat may be placed on your person and then money asked for! We were given a room upgrade upon arrival...........rose petals on beds. Fresh flowers and complimentary water in rooms. We had a brilliant time in Marrakech - a much cheaper holiday than anticipated - we enjoyed the luxury of the Sofitel.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,maxxie_10 wrote a review Jul 2010,40,"Wonderful hotel, but a few recommendations",My husband and I stayed a week in the Sofitel in June 2010. The hotel was very beautiful both exterior and interior the room was a bit small but elegant. The food and the service in the restaurant (including breakfast restaurant) was good. The garden and swimming pools were gorgeous and the lounge beds were absolutely fantastic. Overall I am rating this hotel as very good but it could become excellent if hotel management would pay attention to the following:  - Service in the pool area and outside bar area was generally not good. Poolbar people were friendly but very slow (took sometimes 45 minutes to get your order delivered). In the bar area waiters were slow not friendly and some of them had difficulties with English.  - Consider an expansion of hotel shops and offer more daily products for guests (e.g. sun and aftersun products international books bottled water simple summer clothing caps sunglasses etc.).  - Consider lowering the prices in the pool area a little. Bottles of water are very expensive and it will cause people to bring their own bottles from the supermarket.

Having read mixed reviews during the booking process  I have to say everything in this hotel was 100% perfect . I have stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world & this was one of the best I've experienced .  The place was immaculate  very spacious  all ammentities in good order & very very helpfull friendly staff especially at the reception & pool lounging area's.  Food was very good in all eating areas of the hotel & our room was very comfortable.The placement of design & furniture was very well thought out in all pasrts of the hotel.  My only bug bear would be that the Hamman & Spa areas came at an extra cost which was not explained on their website. I feel this should be included in the room price as this is the case in other surrounding hotels.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,KullyP wrote a review Jul 2010,50,I would go back....,We had a few rooms during our entire stay of 10 days at this hotel as there were 7 of us. Though initially we did have an issue with the location of where one of the rooms were situated but this was easily resolved by Hanane at the reception- who was amazingly helpful throughout our stay.  The rooms were comfortable the bathroom could do with an extractor fan of some sort- it got very stuffy at times. The views weren't amazing from all the rooms but not terrible either.  We had a few issues ranging from: construction work in one of the rooms above our at 7/8 in the morning. Room not cleaned until late afternoon. and as annoying as these issues can be as we were a fussy crowd they were drowned by how beautiful the hotel is and how helpful some of the staff can be: Hanane Leila Khalid Anees....thank you guys so much!  I completely agree with the previous review- the beautiful smell of the hotel still lingers. And it was a haven to return to after the busy hussle and bustle of the medina.  The hotel has a brilliant pool area so pencil some time to lounge and take in the sun.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,schooleydoo wrote a review Jun 2010,20,unjustified costs,English breakfast - ¬£30.  One orange juice one coke (in a can) - ¬£12.  20ml bottle of cheap sun lotion - ¬£25.  1 hour of internet access - ¬£8.    When paying ¬£180 per night for a room I was rather disappointed in the pricing structure for basic services/goods. We had planned to spend most of our time in the hotel and grounds so decided on the Sofitel due to the excellent pool area. However we were quickly put off of this due to the above. A day at the pool would easily have cost ¬£100 per day for us. We instead decided to see more of the city and spend our money elsewhere.    Fruit delivered to the room was a nice touch and the maid service is very good. The analogue TV was at least 10 years old and most channels were out of tune/bad signal.    We wanted to make a purchase from the boutique but there was no staff there. The concierge response was that it was closed. Although the doors were open and lights/music on...    Location is just outside the Medina walls but rooms facing the pool have to endure endless moped whine and car horns til around 1am. Soundproofing those rooms would have been nice.    Not the experience I was hoping for although Marrakech is certainly an interesting place and I am glad it forced us out of the safety of the western hotel and into the real Morocco!,Date of stay: June 2010,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/schooleydoo

Althugh I must say I saw many beautiful Moroccan hotels all over the city. When we arrived we were greeted with very nice mint tea and during our stay all the staff was very helpful and always available. This hotel is gorgeous with a view to the pool and I personally loved the bathroom which had also a typical Moroccan style. The pool area is very well mantained and the SPA is superb. The food was also very good but after the first night we preferred the typical local restaurants to see more of the city. The city center was about 10-15 minutes walk from the hotel which we did not mind but you can always order a taxi at the reception.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Catherine068 wrote a review Apr 2010,30,Lovely Hotel Let Down By Bad Service,"We booked this hotel because it had good facilities so that if we didn't want to leave the hotel there were things to do. Before we set off for Marrakech I tried ringing the hotel about half a dozen times to book a car to pick us up from the airport but was passed from pillar to post. I was asked to send a fax request and to send email requests but no one bothered to get back to me without incessant chasing by phone. Well it was ""start as you mean to go on""!!    The hotel lobby was impressive on arrival and smelt wonderful - candles were burning and there were hundreds of roses We had two rooms - one was ok but mine was not great. Firstly it was immediately over and to one side of the huge porch that is the hotel entrance. There is a driveway with fountains that lead you up from the road to the hotel and on our first night they decided to start jet washing the drive at about 1.00am and it went on pretty much the whole night. By the time they finished the fountains (which seem to be switched off at 00:15 hours each night) were turned back on. Then there was all the noise of hotel guests coming and going and the taxis picking people up right underneath my window. Really noisy and not great. In short do not stay in a room at the front of the hotel. The rooms at the back overlook the garden and the pools - much more peaceful.    Room size was fine and cleanliness also good generally but housekeeping were hit and miss everyday in terms of whether they left you towels face clotsh etc - or simply forgot to replenish them! Ditto re toiletries. For a 5 star spa hotel there was only shower gel and shampoo in the bathroom and some cotton buds - they did leave me some conditioner once ... overall rather disappointing compared to the many 5* hotels I've stayed in all over the world.    I used the [very small] gym. It was equipped with seriously old equipment in a small room. Weights were in another small room next door. The indoor pool is only open to those having spa treatments and was too small and too warm to swim in properly. The spa changing facilities are ultra poor - I'm a regular spa-goer both at home and on travels and apart from the waiting area the spa facilities were the worst I've seen in a hotel. The treatment rooms were clinical and not welcoming the venetian blinds at the windows let sunlight in even thought they were closed no nice smells from burnnign oils or candels one would usually expect in a treatment room and to top it all off there was a lot of noise coming from outside which I could probably have ignored if there had been some music playing gently in the background My therapist did not speak English and so I spoke to her in French only to discover that she could not speak French either which was unusal for Morocco; and of course I could not speak Arabic - so it was like a chicken trying to talk to a duck! When my treatment was finished there was no one at the desk for me to sign the paperwork - I waited but no one came. So I left but was then asked to please go back to the spa to sign it. I obliged and went along - but no one at the desk again. I tried a third time and success! For a holiday and given that the spa was supposed to be relaxing experience it was too much like hard work.    The staff at the hotel are lovely but the service was very poor - basically because it was achingly slow or the staff were just forgetful. You could ask for something and it would not come at all or where at another hotel it would be with you in a couple of minutes this hotel regularly took half an hour or more and then they only carried out the request because you chased. We ate in the only restaurant open in the evening and the service there was the worst of all. What should've been a 1.5 hour meal on two nights became 4 hours due to rubbish service - even the bill took 25 minutes to come and then it was only because my friend got up and started pacing with a furious look on her face at which point the BBQ chef (it was a buffet that night) went to find a waiter before there was a scene.    Breakfast is served in the Palmarie restaurant which is only open for breakfast and lunch. 250 dirham from breakfast - flat charge - it's a buffet. There is one evening restaurant only so there is no other choice if you want to eat in of an evening. There's also a bar adjacent to it which has a nice atmosphere. There is no all day coffee shop or restaurant like at other hotels which was disappointing as if you stay in you had to eat during the restaurant opening hours. You could have room service but it'll cost you a whopping 150 dirham service charge no matter how small your order! Before I forget - for a 5* hotel this hotel has no tea making facilities in the rooms - it's really basic.    The gardens were lovely (though not as nice as other hotels we wandered into around the same area) and there are two outside pools - one heated and one unheated. There is also a very small jacuzzi. I was mortified one morning to find a massive and very dead bullfrog lying on its back at the bottom of the pool ... there is a lot of muck in the pool if you look closely - can't be helped as there are lots of overhanging trees but I don't know how often the pool is cleaned. The heated pool got very busy in the afternoons as tourists decided to stay at the hotel rather than wander around in the heat sightseeing but there as always somewhere to sit even if it's not where you wanted to sit. Also very noisy as many out of control kids jumped and dived into the pools despite the fact there were signs saying ""no diving"". If you want quiet time by the pool use it when the families are out exploring in the morning as it tends not to get overly busy until about 3.00pm. Agai don't expect poolside service to be quick - even askign for a towel took two attempts on my second day - I only asked once on the other day I sat by the pool but they forgot about me and I didn't bother to ask again!    Basically lovely hotel with lovely staff but seriously let down by shoddy service - you can expect better service in a 3* hotel in other parts of the world. I know they have to clean the outer areas some time but do they really need to start doing it when their guests are sleeping in the middle of the night. Not a lot of thought went into that - says it all really. And complaning doesn't get you very far either! Nevertheless I would recommend the hotel for its location and general cleanliness and comfortable furniture. Sleep quality was good marred only by the constant noises. The only good thign that happened was that we wanted to go on a day trip to the Atlas Mountains. We were offered just one trip to the Ourika Valley so took that one. The concierge managed to arrange it whilst we waited but the service was not exceptional - just on a par with any other hotel and nothing more and nothing less than expected.",Date of stay: April 2010,Trip type: Traveled with friends,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Catherine068

My only advice is don't eat there and take your own alcohol is you want a night cap. It's extreamly expensive. A small glass of wine is ¬£8.00 and I had a Pizza ¬£10.00 I could of brought the same Pizza in Asda in the UK for a ¬£1.00 it was nothing special. It's very central to all the attractions. A taxi ride from the Airport is around ¬£14.00 and to the medina is ¬£4.00 day time and ¬£5.00 evening. You can get a fantastic breakfast for ¬£4.50 (gourmet) in the road left of the hotel. (La Table du Marche) just ask the guides outside they will point you in the right direction as they all eat there. If your French is not good do take a phrase book with you.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Penny Black wrote a review Jan 2010,30,i wish we'd stayed at the Riads...,we booked here for 8 nights over xmas... i have to say it was all a bit mediocre & disappointing. i'd booked for a twin but got a double on arrival. The rooms were quite stuffy but we were told that air-con wasn't in use at this time of the year but we were on the first floor & weren't too happy to sleep with the patio doors open (although we realize now it was quite safe)    The TV was very dated & only had one English channel. The bed on the other hand was super comfortable. The room service was very limited although it was quick & food did arrive hot. If you wanted breakfast in the room it's 150 MAD (¬£12) extra (this doesn't apply to rest of menu). was quite disappointed there wasn't a kettle or iron in the room. The bathroom was of a good standard & spacious.  most of the staff i found quite cold & rude this could possibly be due to communication barrier but a smile wouldn't go amiss.    The hotel itself & all the public spaces (lobby area outdoor pool outdoor seating areas etc) were all very beautiful & relaxed & charming. The corridors were very dark & dated but they were repainting whilst we were there.    i didn't think this hotel was upto a 5* standard.. i could go on but you get the gist.,Date of stay: December 2009,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Kent, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/penny888

Two restaurants; one serves breakfast and lunch and the other one serves dinner. One bar plus two additional poolside bars. If we are in Marrakesh again we will certainly stay here.

The hotel was both calming and yet busy the size of it allowing you to make the choice of how involved you wanted to be. The resturaunts and bars gave great service throughout the day and the two pools one heated and one not had a very large number of beds and 'baals' aound them with a large number of staff to catter to your every wish. The Medina was a 5 minute walk away and there seemed to be a lot fewer touts and guides around since the last time we were there.  The function rooms were fabuloue but the bedrooms needed a little tlc the carpets in particular are getting a little wotn. The beds and linen however were fabulous and the showers over the baths had good pressure and flow of water.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,alexanddeb wrote a review Oct 2009,40,"This is a lovely hotel, but needs some work to be 5 stars",My husband and I just returned from 2 weeks in Morocco. We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. It's a pretty hotel but the service level is not what it should be.    The lobby is beautiful but the desk staff are more than a little cold. We had a problem with our bill and it took 45 minutes to correct. I think another 5 star property would have been more accomodating but we found that in Morocco the service in general is very forced. One often has to beg for service and then it's given grudgingly.    The rooms are fine but not spectacular. The hallways are a little dingy just a little. And the TVs are old school (why Sofitel?) but the beds are nicely upgraded and the bathroom was also quite nice and appropriate for a 5 star property. This place is a bit sprawling. Our room was a full 5 minute walk to the lobby you may want to ask for a closer room.    The restaurant for breakfast was great. Yes it's expensive but what part of 5 star hotel do people not understand? The prices here are on par with any other property of its caliber. The bar doesn't have much to offer and we did not dine in the upstairs restaurant.    The pool area is quite nice. And one does have to ask for service but we found that once we did we got served well. The lounge chairs are comfortable the place is serene and relaxing.    There are things to do in walking distance from the hotel but it's a bit of a walk. The concierge made a couple of suggestions I'd like to comment on: 1. Chez Ali Grand Spectacle-very touristy but kind of fun in a cheesy way. Ask about it. 2. One concierge suggested that we buy souvenirs at the government authorized price fixed store as it would be less complicated for us. SCAM. Not price fixed at all but really beautiful things. If you go prepare for haggling. Most tourists don't know they can haggle and pay 5x at least what the item is worth. 3. Dar Rhizlane Restaurant about a 5 minute cab ride from the hotel WOW! The best meal we had in Morocco BY FAR. What a BEAUTIFUL RIAD (actually you should look into staying there) but DO EAT THERE. Wow.    We did get a guide from the hotel for a few hours with a car. Though pricey it's really the best way to see the city. Just for 2-3 hours. At the very least one gets to ride around and see the local scenes. I've been to the tannery twice and it is interesting. The imperial gardens are really not worth the visit. Spend most of your time just being driven so you see the scope of the city maybe see a palace and then get dropped at the big square that's where the life is. Especially after dark on Fri-Sun. Fun.    Marrakech is an exciting city and the Sofitel is a good choice.,Date of stay: October 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cincinnati, Ohio",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexanddeb
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Lilianne wrote a review Oct 2009,50,Marvellous Marrakesh,Went for a long weekend at the beginning of October to the Sofitel Marrakesh. Having arrived quite late in the evening we were escorted outside to a special bar that had been set just for us. Excellent even in the night lights we could see the hotel looked beautiful and was in lovely surroundings. Unfortunatel the stupid card that opened the door wouldn't work and we had to have another room for the first night. The people were so apologetic and offered all manner of things for the inconvenience. A bottle of morrocan wine sweets and a basket of fruit later and we were in heaven. The rooms are practical and large enough for two and the beds are fantastic and so comfortable. Rose petals were stren all over the bed and bathroom lovely. We ate breakfast in the hotel every morning and it was buffet style and more than adequate for anyone. Ate at the pool bar one lunchtime and the food was lovely but the serve poor. We ate out the rest of the time as we were on an organised tour. Comptoir Darna is a must for a dining experience. Quad biking and camel riding in the atlas mountains is a must for anyone also as the scenery is spectacular. We also wet to the Margharita Olive Grove for a traditional moroccan lunch which was beautiful. The souks and markets of Marrakesh are amazing just to sit and people watch or try your hand at haggling which is such fun. I even got myself a few freebies just for trying my luck (maybe it was the scottish charm). I wasn't really looking forward to this trip but it was an amazing experience and I would return again. I was only just settling in when we had to come home. I loved the Sofitel and found the staff amazing and at your disposal all the time.  The spa was great. I had a full body massage and facial and enjoyed every minute of it although the girl could not speak a word of english. It was quite funny understanding each other but we got there! The two pools are wonderful and the staff escort you to your sunbed and put out towels etc for you which for me took a bit of getting used to. I would return to this hotel again no problem and would recommend it to anyone.,Date of stay: October 2009,,"Dumfries and Galloway, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lilianne
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,breeze wrote a review Oct 2009,20,Won't go back !,Finally got to sit down to write my 2 cents on this one ...  We went there for 3 days . I thought that it was expensive but as you know the wife won as they usually do . Nothing prepared me though for the rip off prices in the hotel . Absolutely shocking ! How can they justify that is an absolute mistery to me . Don't get me wrong we travel a lot and stay in good hotels but this was far too much . Not only the service is very poor  we there waiting for a sandwich by the pool for 1 hour ! I sat there waiting for a waiter to come talk to me for 30 minutes then decided to go to the bar myself they were all having a chat  then tried to involve me in the conversation so I just said : 'Can we have some service over there ...' Cheeky sods ! then the rooms we stayed in what they call 'prestige suite ' what prestige ? A suite with no cofee maker  and old TV that looked like my gramma's  no ironing board  i mean seriously for Stg 400 / night.  Then you've the staff in reception  there was a lot of empty rooms in the hotel but they just refused to move our friends to a decent room ( not overlooking the hotel's rubish dump) when they finally did they moved them to the next door room  go figure !  Basically the hotel is ok but that's about it .  Don't expect service  don't expect a smile from reception staff and don't expect a superbe room .  Room service was good though I must admit.  If you happen to stay there by mistake  well use the caf / restaurant not far from the hotel. It's much cheaper  good service and very good value for money.,Date of stay: August 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Dubai,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/najibo31
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,TravelBugBittenM wrote a review Oct 2009,10,What a waste of money!,This hotel doesn't deserve it's five stars. It is all show and nothing else. It's like the designers built the entrance reception and pool area and thought well that looks impressive we needn't bother putting any effort into anything else!  I rarely splurge on expensive holidays don't get me wrong I like to travel to exotic places and stay in beautiful surroundings but I rarely stay anywhere 5 star and when I do I expect it to be worth the money. In the past this has been the case however I have never recieved such poor service in my life. When we arrived we handed over our expedia booking details to a woman (certainly no lady) on reception who asked us to take a seat she then ignored us for 45 minutes. Fair enough the reception area was busy it was midday and people were coming and going but to ignore people sat in front of you for such a long time is in my opinion dispicable. No offer of a drink to boot. But what tops that is that when we approached again she didn't even have the decency to apologise! Outrageous. A belated emotionless apology came when she finally developed some observation skills and sensed my annoyance. I couldn't even complain I was that livid. Plus I got the distinct impression she couldn't care less that she'd left us waiting so long.  As I say the hotel reception and pool is very impressive in terms of decor at least however the rooms weren't exactly special devoid of personality and could be likened to a travel lodge. Very disappointing given that Marrakesh is home to such fantastic interior design and the sofitel claims to be a luxury 5 star hotel.  I felt like I wasn't able to relax fully by the pool as the drinks prices were just ridiculous. I think it was something like almost ¬£4 for a large bottle of still water and similar for a can of coke or sprite. Very irritating when it a cost you can't avoid. What planet are these people on! I'll tell you what planet they are on one where they are busy designing a food menu for dogs (yes really!) while they forget about the needs of the people they should be serving. When this ¬£4 drink arrives don't be suprised if it takes a good ten minutes to get to you and you'd be expecting too much it seems to expect a clean glass to drink it from or ice cubes made from mineral water so you can enjoy them without consequence.  We were lured into booking this hotel by the impressive looking pools which were lovely it's just a shame we dehydrated at the side of them to avoid remortgaging!  What a let down enough to put you off luxury.  Get your act together Sofitel you could be so much better.,Date of stay: October 2009,,Swad,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelBugBittenM
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,sally-ann l wrote a review Sep 2009,40,LOVELY HOTEL,The hotel was lovely beautiful grounds outside lots of sunbeds etc and high standard of communal areas. The only let down is the corridors they appear dark and a little dingy but if that was put right it wd be a first class five star hotel. The restaurant upstairs looks more like an American sportsbar; downstairs where breakfast is served is much nicer. For some reason red wine is served cold from the cellar - room temperature is a totally unknown quantity to them. The breakfasts are very good lots of choice and very helpful staff. The pool bar restaurant is boring and limited. The best restaurants locally are Le Comptois and Jad Mahal both within walking distance of the hotel and both serve red wine at correct temp! Morocco is very casual; don't bother taking your best clothes - even in very nice restaurants like the ones mentioned they are not required! The spa is extremely expensive around ¬£60 for a massage. Unusually web access is free in the business centre most hotels charge but the Sofitel do not which was a nice change. We stayed in a superior room which was lovely; each evening the maid sprinkled rose petals in teh bathroom in the bathmat.,Date of stay: September 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Beckenham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BelmontLondon
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Sheraz1 wrote a review Sep 2009,50,STUNNING,"The Sofitel Marrakech is absolutely beautiful.    We were very impressed with the service and staff. The gardens and grounds are immaculate.    We loved the two pools jacuzzi and the whole outside space. Very peaceful with lots of sunbeds huge padded seating areas hammocks and bean bags so you can always find a nice spot to relax. There is also a huge chess board to keep you occupied. Could not fault it.    We stayed in the Classic room. The room is more than adequate and styled with a loose morrocon theme. Although the room was not as stunning as some 5 * hotel rooms that we have stayed in but it is more than comfortable. There is a separate toilet as you enter the room and a separate bathroom with washbasin just off the bedroom. A window seat and balcony to enjoy the views of the grounds. One gripe that I had was that the bed was comprised of two large singles put together rather than one large double bed. But this was only a minor irritation.    The location of the hotel was perfect around 10-15 minutes from Jema el fna (main square). Well within walking distance and no need to take a taxi.    We did not eat in the hotel as it was very expensive my Morrocan standards so we had breakfast at a local cafe/restuarant (Cafe Blatt) which was 2 minutes walk away from the hotel. It was very nice food at a reasonable price. The Cafe has a european menu with the restuarant upstairs serving a mixture of european and morrocan food.    Top tips from our trip:-    -We learnt quite quickly that petit taxi's (small cabs i.e. not the big mercedes) would take you pretty much anywhere in Marrakech for 20 Dirhams. If they asked for more we would simply walk away to the next one. There is always one around.    -Do not let a taxi driver take you to some shopping centre; it happened to us when all we wanted was a supermarket. Although the shopping centre was very nice and we spent around 30 minutes looking at the equisite furniture; it was not where we wanted. The driver was probably on some kind of commission. If you want to go to a particular site make sure thats where they drop you.    -Pay no more than 100 Dirhams to and from the airport (less if using a petit taxi). We paid 70 Dirhams.    -Always agree a price (for excursions taxis or claeches) first and dont be afraid to haggle.    -Make sure you check what is included when you book an excursion i.e. lunch guides etc. We met a couple that paid the same as us for an Atlas excurision (300 dirham) but then they had to pay extra for lunch when we did not.    -Ignore anyone who offers to give you a guided tour or information about certain sites (they will most probably want money for their services). Part of the fun is wandering around getting lost. A gentleman came over to us started telling us about a site and then suddenly asked for 20 dirhams!! the cheek. Just refuse politely and walk away.    -In hindsight we would not have bothered eating in Jema el fna; worst meal we had in Marrakech but I suppose it is one of those things you have to do.    -Make sure you visit the Atlas mountains Musee de Marrakech Ben Youseff the Souks and Jardin Marjorelle. Stunning!    -Haggle like mad in the Souks! Some of the prices are far to expensive when compared to what you would pay back home; So just think of what you would like to pay for an item and stick to it.    -Purchase items that you wont necessarily get back home i.e. hand decorated tea glasses rather than the factory made versions (which you could purchase in the UK) plates with designs carved in to them rather than just painted on etc.    -Politely refuse any item that is presented to you that you do not want. A simple La Shukrun (""no thank you"") should suffice.    -take a collapsable bag in your luggage if you are planning on buying from the Souks.    -If you get lost ask a shop keeper or fellow tourist.    Marrakech is an amayzing place and we thoroughly enjoyed our break there.",Date of stay: August 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Wales,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sheraz1

Whilst the hotel itself is very expensive the pool and room made up for it. It is an excellent location to explore the amazing Marrakesh and it only steps away from the gorgeous le comptoir restaurant. You must agree a price with the taxis waiting outside the hotel otherwise they will fleece you. As the Sofitel is seen to be the best hotel in the area taxi drivers charge an arm and a leg just to get into town.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,eddie365 wrote a review Feb 2009,30,Easy fixes would improve the Sofitel,I stayed in the Sofitel in January 2009 as part of a business trip. First impressions were excellent. Staff were really helpful and the public areas of the hotel were fantastic really fresh and clean and they managed to mix the open plan with the feeling of comfort and intimacy.  The Orangerie bar was pleasent too a little overcrowded when busy but a nice ambience.  I only ate breakfast in the hotel and this was a disappointing experience. Talking with others there we clearly chose an unfortunate time (8.30am Friday) because my experience was by no means universal but after being seated at an uncleared table asking for coffee and cutlery 3 times I gave up and got my own (cutlery - the coffee had to wait...). The next day I went for a simple room service breakfast which was great but took the best part of an hour to arrive.  The room was short of what I'd been expecting too. The size was fine and the bed comfortable and it was nice to have a balcony but little things let it down namely the shower leaked horribly when used the furniture wasn't that great so the tv cabinet didn't close and drawers wouldn't shut properly. Also the tv remote didn't work until we asked for it to be changed. It was clean and cleaned really well though.  Overall I'd say it's a very good hotel if you get a very good rate and was let down by some easy-to-fix irritations only. It's a 3 rating based on higher expectations.,Date of stay: January 2009,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Alrewas, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eddie365
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,george01 wrote a review Dec 2008,40,Beautiful Hotel & Surroundingsl,Visited Marrakech for 4 days at the very beginning of November and spent 2 nights at a riad in the medina and 2 nights at the SMI. It was a plesant change from the medina environment to a westernized one. The hotel itself is beatiful gardens fountains just about everything. The neighborhood was also very nice and safe. Check-in was somewhat different but that was the Moroccan charm incense continuously burning was enjoyed at the beginning of the stay but it becomes tiring after the first day. Deluxe king room was very confortable with a balcony overlooking the medina pool and mountains. Perfect spot to enjoy some wine and watch the sunset. Be aware they speak very little English except for the front desk and waiting staff and it was quite limited at that. If you speak french or arabic shouldn't be a problem. Most of the guests during the time we were there were french-speaking. Be also aware that only very few places sell bottles of wine to take-out (besides hotels of course at exorbitant prices) and they're located very far from the hotel. We got ours from a small hotel restaurant near the hotel from their regular wine list at a reasonable price . By the way Moroccan wine is very good. Unfortunely we got sick upon checking-in (food at the riad where we were before was a little too rich for us) so couldn't enjoy everything that was offered including the restaurants but room service was very efficient. Breakfast was excellent with lots of choices of cold and hot foods and included in the price of the room or at least ours was. Be also aware that if you chose one of the rates offered at their web site they break down the bill by each service provided but the total is the same as advertised in the web site. Service was generally good only one incident at the pool bar where the woman head waitress yelled at some employees including our waiter because he didn't get my name printed but my signature. He had asked me to sign the check since I was going to charge it to the room. Very unpleasant person. Since we were celebrating a special anniversary a bouquet of roses was delivered to the room at least 30+ roses in a beatiful arrangement from the hotel manager. Nice touch and very much appreciated. My wife was very sad to leave them behing when we left. In addition snacks i.e. olives fruits and pastries were also delivered to the room. I don't know but if there were issues with service before according to previous reviews they have been resolved since or we were very lucky. Either way we really enjoyed our stay at the SMI even though we were a little under the weather.,Date of stay: November 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,boston,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/george01
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,architrekker wrote a review Sep 2008,20,Horrible Service,This was my first stay at a Sofitel although I have traveled extensively in various countries. I will not be staying at Sofitel again. The hotel looks very nice when you check in but the beauty is superficial. The valet virtually refused to leave my room until I gave him 100 dirhams (10 euro) - he just stood in the door smiling at me with his hand held out. Taxis were not permitted to enter the grounds - the taxi queue was at the next street corner where every driver knew to overcharge the Sofitel clients. The pool staff was completely useless. Most of the chairs around the pool were broken and every day we were told that they would be replaced with new chairs the next day. Never happened. The most surprising thing at the Sofitel was the horrible food - truly the worst hotel food I have ever experienced and also the most expensive. The breakfast buffet (20 euros per person) included hard dry pastries a poor selection of cold cuts and the worst coffee I have ever tasted. Everything was straight from a tin or jar. The one sandwich that I had the misfortune to taste at the pool bar could have passed for dog food.    Unfortunately Marrakech does not have many choices if you are looking for a full-service hotel.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Super Jumbo wrote a review Jul 2008,20,Take the good with the bad?,Only stay in this hotel if you get a discounted rate. We stayed in a Deluxe room and concur with other recent reviews... the room was dated the carpet faded the furniture stained. And the noise from the Hotel's bar (even after midnight) was a real problem for us trying to get to sleep. Our television picture was far from clear and despite politely advising the concierge this was not corrected. The doormen here are really polite and friendly but I dont recommend asking the concierge for help or advice. He is arrogant and only interested in up-selling you onto some kind of tour deal..possibly because there's a commission in it for him. His advice left me feeling uncomfortable and I felt treated like an idiot. He is not an asset to Sofitel by any means. He is condescending in manner and borderline rude. The pool is nice but nowhere near as amazing as the marketing photos would lead you to beleive. The room was big but I am not sure how a deluxe differs to a standard... dont bother upgrading your room type. The fridge was old and barely worked at cooling down anything.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Super Jumbo wrote a review Jul 2008,20,Take the good with the bad?,Only stay in this hotel if you get a discounted rate. We stayed in a Deluxe room and concur with other recent reviews... the room was dated the carpet faded the furniture stained. And the noise from the Hotel's bar (even after midnight) was a real problem for us trying to get to sleep. Our television picture was far from clear and despite politely advising the concierge this was not corrected. The doormen here are really polite and friendly but I dont recommend asking the concierge for help or advice. He is arrogant and only interested in up-selling you onto some kind of tour deal..possibly because there's a commission in it for him. His advice left me feeling uncomfortable and I felt treated like an idiot. He is not an asset to Sofitel by any means. He is condescending in manner and borderline rude. The pool is nice but nowhere near as amazing as the marketing photos would lead you to beleive. The room was big but I am not sure how a deluxe differs to a standard... dont bother upgrading your room type. The fridge was old and barely worked at cooling down anything.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,cbss wrote a review Jun 2008,20,Only book this hotel if you get a great rate!,We regularly stay in Sofitel hotels in different countries and were disappointed by the Sofitel Marrakech. It is not up to the usual Sofitel standard.    We were impressed by the standard of customer service - staff were very polite particularly the doormen. We also loved the fact that the hotel was filled with the scent of fleur d'oranger in the evenings.    What we didn't like was that the room's decor was dated. The thick carpet felt dusty as did the beds (we were constantly sneezing). We were also quite shocked to find that the doors linking our room to our neighbours' were not locked meaning that we could walk from our room to the next! The sound proofing was poor we could hear everything going on in the next room.    Nice fitness centre but it is a shame that you need to pay extra to use the hammam.    Breakfast buffet is OK but not great for a Sofitel.,,,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cbss
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,BoavistaPortugal wrote a review May 2008,10,Choose a Riad,"We are Sofitel Privalage card holders and I have to say I have rarely felt less privalaged! I find the reviews here staggering in their praise of this Hotel which frankly we couldn't wait to leave.I would recommend reading ""kceese's"" review ""unbiased review"" - rather than repeat it all I would just add from our own experience.    We had stayed at a Riad for our first 5 days then after a trip south had wanted a calm hotel outside of the Medina. The Sofitel seemed the best and obvious choice. We found the reception on arrival so unhelpful it bordered on downright rudeness. The room was okay but not great the hotel is large with lot's of facilities buit the overall manner of the staff really lets it down. All were curt preoccupied with talking to other staff members and generally unhelpful. Breakfast was fabulous - I ordered tea it didn't come I asked again (nicely!!) and had two pot's of water slammed on the table so the water flew out of the spouts. The waiter then started a heated argument with a collegue who reprimanded him right in the middle of the breakfast room. A manager was standing nearby - didn't say a word. That summed the hotel up for me. We moved to the Meridian which possibly wasn't as smart but the staff were a delight. Frankly I'd choose one of the wonderful Riads (we had stayed in La Sultana for our first few days-superb) or if you want a Hotel stay at the Meridian next door.",Date of stay: May 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Portugal,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BoavistaPortugal
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Travelpony wrote a review May 2008,50,Great hotel,We stayed here on our first night and were very pleased we did. We arrived at about 9.30 a.m and our room was ready - standard double with a view over the gardens and pond - not the best view but as we weren't staying in our room all the time this was not a problem. Room was nice and big and very clean with a lovely bathroom. The pool is great although there were a lot of families with children which made it very noisy and a bit hectic in the pool. The gardens of the hotel are beautiful and there are plenty of shade spots. The bars and seating areas are plentiful and the hotel complex itself is very big so it feels very spacious and not too crowded. The staff are all very professional helpful and friendly. We were greeted with mint tea and moroccan pastries which was a nice touch. The hotel is located in the new district so its about 20 mins to the old part and the medina. Lots of lovely restaurants and bars within and around the hotel. The breakfast was great - continental buffet style as well as hot cooked food - definitely worth it if you fill up on it as you won't need lunch. If we visit Marrakech again we will definitely stay here.,Date of stay: May 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelpony

Fabulous reception areas with really friendly well trained staff. We had lunch here by the pool and it was lovely. Good value considering he luxe surroundings and I had a salad nicoise with bread that was too big to finish.    Had mint tea on the terrace which has numerous comfy chairs and a real no hurry atmosphere.    We sat and listened to the musician in the main reception and we were given more tea - free to all this time.    As we were leaving we were stopped by the manager who kindly offered to show us the whole hotel and send me some special offers by email. He was so nice unpretentious and keen for us to go again. We saw the stunning therapy areas but not sure if it is extra to use the pool - which looks fantastic.    We decided to return later on and had drinks in the bar where we were entertained by different jazz musicians.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,STEVEFR wrote a review Apr 2008,40,Lovely Hotel,As per other recent reviews I would agree that this hotel has sorted the problems discussed in more distant reviews. The check in process is personal and perfect. Checkout also speedy. The public areas of the hotel are wonderful and spacious. The large pool was a bit cold but it was still early march. The hotel is situated close enough to the Medina and square to walk very easily but far enough away to avoid the hustle and bustle there. It's a 15 min very easy walk.  Petit taxis from outside the hotel seem to be an absolute rip-off so do persist with haggling for a fair price. The taxi to airport started at dm150 and ended up paying dm20. Better still insist on the meter.  The restaurant areas are very nice but high prices for good quality. The breakfast buffet was operating stretched but efficiently at full hotel capacity. Wide choice of foods available.  Searches were not made at the entry as other reviews suggest though there was a always many security at door and gates.  We had a suite which was most spacious bedroom / living area / bathroom and reception area. Storage facilities everywhere.  Only criticism of room as per usual with accor hotels is choice of tv. 2 english channel only both news. Very poor!!!  Pool bar staff attentive. Bar staff just outside of main hotel area could be more speedy and acknowledge those waiting.  Tip when eating out. Dont drink the water except when bottled and avoid salads.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,EsotericKent_UK wrote a review Apr 2008,40,Gorgeous,Would love to see where some of the doommongers on here usually stay. We didnt actually stay here because of the reviews (thanks for nothing guys) however we did pop along for a 3 hour session twice on their fabulous terrace and pool bar. Ive stayed in some lovely hotels for both work and not and this looks 5 star all the way to me-certainly in the areas I could see. It was very very clean too.. They dont got for fancy bathroom products in Morocco    All I can say is that I thought public areas were amazingly gorgeous beautiful terraces and pools and the service was excellent even if it was just beers (came with lovely nuts and olives etc) and a smile. Had a look at pool bar venue-pretty pricey certainly but you dont have to eat there its not compulsory and the location was lovely.    To the person who said it wasnt convenient it was the most convenient hotel there was! short of staying in the medina . Must have been a 10-15 minute walk at the most to the square if you wanted to go there and 2 minutes in a cab.    Lovely gardens too.    We did 2 nights in a Riad and 5 nights in a hotel (Kenzi Farah) and personally and I know its not fashionable to say so but I preferred the hotel as not that keen on dark and empty alleys late at night.    I would undoubtedly stay here next time we visit and unless the rooms are truly dismal and I doubt it then I am sure we will enjoy it. I think a few people have a crap holiday for all sorts of reasons-bad weather relationships unrealistic expectations not pertinent to the countries they are going to and then take some very minor stuff out on some of the hotels..    I always book independently-specify a room (ie 4th floor overlooking pool or sea etc pay accordingly ask them to confirm this print it off and take it with me and have never had an issue with it.    I do feel for the couple though who have had problems on being charged. Claim a refund from your card providers surely and say it was an unauthorised payment as you must have copies of any correpondence sent. Failing that find out who does Sofitels PR in the UK (search via the web) and let them know what you think and that you will be sending a piece into the holiday nightmare section in the Sunday Times.,Date of stay: April 2008,,"Kent, UK",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EsotericKent_UK
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Andrew wrote a review Mar 2008,40,An unbiased review,I am going to be as objective as I can in this review. Many of the reviews below are pretty one-sided and I am going to explain my side of the story. The hotel is not all that good but is not all that bad.  I hope you find my review helpful in making hotel selection in the future    First.. the pros    = Wonderful exterior  = beautiful swimming pool (but I didn't swim in it)  = Wonderful and helpful conceige  r= full service cashier (note that you cannot exchange anything from Dirhams to other currency in the hotel)  = Good restaurant selection  = Well equipped and helpful business center  = Clean interior  = Nice and modern shower with strong showerhead  = On-time room service  = Mint tea on arrival  = chocolates and rose pedals on bed during turndown  Now the not so goods or the cons    = Standard rooms have a not-so-pleasant view. So try to stay in Deluxe or Superior rooms if you can  = Many of the staff particular House Keeping and Room Service staff do not speak good English and you may need to repeat what you say  = Slow very slow service. I asked for a razor and shaving cream to be delivered since BA lost my bags. They were very nice and said Yes no problem. But 45 minutes and no one arrived. I called again and they said sure it will be up soon. 45 minutes later no one arrived. I got tired and just didn't shave that night. My friends asked for some slippers and it took then 45 minutes to bring them up  = Air conditioning does not work in some rooms so please beware. It worked perfectly in my room but it didn't work in my friends room (it became very hot)  = Room service menu is misleading. Even though continental breakfast is listed as 150 dirhams on the menu there is actually a hidden 100 dirham delivery fee that is unstated so the total ended up being 250.  = Also the poor Enlgish of room service staff actually misinterpreted my order. I asked for omlets and tea (should have cost 135 dirhams). However they brought the entire continental breakfast set plus the omelts (345 dirhams). Apparently you cannot order just the omlets. You have to order the entire continental breakfast set as a minimum and all other orders are additionals. No one informed me this not even the menu or when I placed my order. So please beware of this. Of course this probably won't apply to you if you can speak French or arabic.  = Conciege may not know everything. They don't know about overnight Sahara desert trips. But they do exist and I STRONGLY RECOMMEND IT. Go to an overnight Sahara desert trip with camel ride. It is SO FUN!!  = No internet available in room which is really unacceptable  = Business center suppose to open at 7am but when I was there at 7:30am no one was there.  = food prices in the 1/F main restaurant were very expensive and were very small portions even if they tasted really good. Also some of the menus do not have prices on them so please beware.  = Water in restaurant cost 45 dirhams compared to 5 dirhams outside.  = Contrary to outer reviews they is NO CHARGE for water in room which is two bottles every day.  = Contrary to other review security DOES NOT confiscate if you bring water from outside.  = the speed dial on telephones do not work. Even if there is a button labeled as Conceige it does not work.  = Lights in the room may not be adequate  = bedding and pillows may be a little firm  = I am not sure but I don't think they offer double bed in many rooms    Overall you are probably better off staying in a raid for the more local flavor. I do enjoy the concerige and hospitality of the staff in Sofitel. The room prices are reasonable (I paid under USD180 for each night) and the rooms are pretty neat. I would recommend Sofitel if you don't want to stay in a raid.,Date of stay: March 2008,,"Hong Kong, China",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Comevisithappy

Breakfast was copious and good freshly cooked with plenty of choice. The pool area made for a ""haven of tranquility"" after a hectic morning in the souks!

Fresh flowers imaginatively displayed every day in the lobbies was enthralling for my mother who is always impressed by such touches.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,stoneyStoney wrote a review Mar 2008,40,Sofitel Marrakech pleasant experience,We recently returned from a long weekend at Sofitel Marrakech and were pleasantly surprised at the beautiful interior gardens and friendly staff. Pool was nice but be prepared for the chilly water!    After reading some earlier reviews we were witholding judgement but the staff were welcoming especially to our 2 1/2 year old son. The locals love young children. Although I wouldnt exactly say the hotel caters for children as such they are not frowned upon when in restaurants or by pool as with some other holiday locations of a high standard.    The check in was fuss free and we we allowed to keep our room on the day of departure until we left. (check out time was supposed to be 12.00)    Food was of a very good standard and breakfast was a wide choice although steer clear of lunch in the orangerie restaurant. It cost us ¬£180 for 6 people (and no alcohol was consumed) so very pricey!    Try the local restaurants outside the hotel which are less expensive or the restaurants surrounding Jemmaa el Fna square are much cheaper.    Would definately stay again.,Date of stay: March 2008,,stoney,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stoneyStoney
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,JVJW wrote a review Mar 2008,50,Perfect break,Despite some less than flattering reviews we had nothing but praise for the Sofitel - perfectly located just outside the mayhem of the old town it was a tranquil and sophisticated place to enjoy a winter break. The entrance is grand and imposing in a french colonial style and the service we received was faultless from start to finish. We were upgraded to a suite on arrival and enjoyed the space this afforded. The balcony had an excellent view over the exceptionally well-tended grounds to the Atlas mountains (althought they were shrouded in mist for most of the time we were there!) The pool was cold (it was February!) but clean and pleasant and made a great place to take a break from the chaos of the souks! The breakfasts were to the usual high standard of a Sofitel and the bar and restaurants were of a good standard. The staff were friendly the hotel immaculate and our stay a delight. The area around the hotel has some good bars and cafes - cheaper than the hotel but less classy and there is a city tour bus which stops almost outside and visits all the main sites.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,elizalily wrote a review Nov 2007,50,loved the hotel,we arrived at the airport and were unable to find the booked hotel minibus perhaps due to airport rebuilding so we had to get a taxi (fleeced and no seat belts). While we were checking in at the hotel the minibus driver phoned to say that he couldn't find us.  Perhaps due to this we were upgraded from a superior room to an Ambassador suite for our three night stay . It was very grand with fresh flowers everywhere even in the dressing gown pockets! We also had fresh fruit and a voucher for two free cocktails .  The food was excellent but very expensive . We did think that more prepared fresh fruit at breakfast would have been nice.    After a week in Essouira we returned for one night and were upgraded to a (the?) Presidential suite which had two bedrooms a shower room and a bathroom with jacuzzi. We had cocktail vouchers again.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,PW33 wrote a review Oct 2007,40,"Nice hotel, very 'French' attitude","We stayed in the Sofitel Marrakech in September 07. The hotel itself is lovely - nicely decorated stylish clean pool and other communal areas all meant our overall impression was to be impressed. The hotel is also in a good location - 10-15 minutes walk both to the Medina and to Avenue Mohammed V where you can find modern stylish restaurants and bars.    There are however just a few snagging points with this hotel that can leave a bad taste in your mouth.    1. On the whole we found our hotel room to be very good - all the facilities you would need a pleasant balcony overlooking the gardens clean attentive room service etc. The only problem for me was that the bed is as hard as a rock - you know the type completely unforgiving should you turn over in the night especially if you're a little tender from over-doing it in the sun.    2. As you'd expect for a Sofitel in Morocco the hotel has a very French feel about it particularly in the attitude of the staff. Many of the non-front desk staff spoke very little English (or were reluctant to do so). This wasn't a problem for us as both of us speak French. However the front-desk receptionist was rude enough to say to us - ""speak to me in English I speak 5 languages so there is no need for you to try to speak French!"". It seems the Parisian attitude has made it to Marrakech!    3. The hotel has an interesting security policy. We returned one evening with 4 bottles of still water that we bought in a nearby shop (the heat in Marrakech means it's essential to drink a lot of water). On arriving back at the hotel security stopped us and told us it is forbidden to bring bottles into the hotel as it is a security issue. I could understand dark or unrecognisable bottles but sealed water the same brand as the hotel sells??!! After arguing our case we were escorted to reception where it was let slip that it had more to do with hotel policy of buying water from room service. Put it this way - 6 dirham (¬£0.40) in a local shop or 90 dirham (¬£5.00) from room service for an identical bottle (which took 40mins to deliver)....hmmmm. If you're in the same situation argue your case this is daylight robbery as we told them in no uncertain terms.    Anyhow despite the above we had a very nice stay in Marrakech and if the management can iron out a few issues with their staff we'd be more than happy to return.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,SnyderFamily25 wrote a review Sep 2007,30,Decent Hotel in Marrakech,My husband and I visited the Sofitel Hotel for three nights in November 06. We were initially quite impressed by the hotel‚Äôs exterior and lobby area (which was bright and airy) and with the polite staff who served us mint tea while we waited to be checked into our room.    We stayed in a double room on the second floor and although our room was nice it was rather dark due to the dark colour of the walls and the lack of sufficient lighting which seemed to be a problem in all areas of the hotel (apart from the lobby area). The bathroom was adequate although we did find it quite annoying to have the toilet in one tiny room and the sink and bath/shower in another room.    We stayed at the Sofitel on a Room Only basis and soon learned that buying breakfast or even a snack or drink was a huge challenge in Marrakech as there are no local convenience stores in the vicinity of the hotel. I would therefore recommend anyone planning to stay at this hotel to consider booking a room which includes breakfast.    Location-wise the hotel is perfectly situated for those who don‚Äôt mind a short walk into the city centre (it took us roughly twenty minutes). Be warned however that some of the pavements (if you can call them that) near the hotel are in drastic need of repair so bring a sensible pair of shoes.    Overall we enjoyed our brief stay in Marrakech and despite having a few issues with regards to the poor lighting inside the hotel the Sofitel suited our basic needs for a reasonably priced hotel within walking distance of the city centre. I would therefore recommend this hotel to anyone planning a short stay in Marrakech who doesn‚Äòt want to pay over the odds for a hotel near to the hustle and bustle of the city centre.,Date of stay: November 2006,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Olivehurst, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SnyderFamily25
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Mr_and_Mrs_Smith_7 wrote a review Sep 2007,40,Generally great,I would definitely recommend this hotel - it was immaculately clean and had a grand modern morrocan feel and we had a very pleasant stay. Initially there was some confusion as the hotel had not received payment from lastminute.com who we booked our package with and for a moment it looked like we were going to be charged again - the staff were very good about this and were able to resolve the issue although it did take a couple of days. We experienced another problem with a tour the hotel booked for us; our transport left without us (despite the fact we were waiting in the hotel reception as instructed) so they organised alternative transport but then tried to charge us for this when we had already paid the cost of the transport within the tour price. Again this issue was resolved without incident when we explained that we were unwilling to pay the charge. Despite these minor hiccups the hotel was lovely and a great escape from the madness of the medina. The staff were friendly and helpful the pool area was fabulous the room was spotless and the little touches like bathrobes in the bathroom and chocolates on the pillow when we returned to our room each night made us feel very looked after.,Date of stay: September 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mr_and_Mrs_Smith_7
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Aug 2007,20,mixed feelings!,My husband and I have spent a couple of days in the Sofitel Marrackech at the beginning of August.  The Hotel does not lack in luxury and the attention to details when it comes to decoration is amazing...a mix between modernity and tradition. A term very often associated to Morocco itself. Although the hotel lobby and other common areas were nicely decorated i have to say that I was quite disappointed with the room themselves. They were very simplisctic and some of the furnitures looked quite old and the carpet and armchairs were stained.  We arrived at 11am and were asked to be seated in one of the numerous comfortable sofas in the lobby and were treated to delicious moroccan mint tea. I found the check-in process a bit long considering there were only two people checking in at the time. Even though we filled the check-in form properly the staff kept referring to us as Mr & and Mrs Nasir (my husband's first name) It was clear that they inverted the first and last name and did not really pay attention when I was correcting them. Check in was not normally until 16pm and they asked us to wait for the room to be ready. I requested to stay in a temporary room while waiting for our room which the receptionist agreed.  When enterring the room we could not find a room service menu so called down Room service who soon delivered one... I found the menu expensive even to UK standard and very limited in choice. 1 beefburger + cheese pasta and 2 moroccan tea came at 430 dhrs. It took 50 mins and 1 phone call to have the food delivered (the person on the phone was quite impatient.The food was tasteless...  When we finally changed rooms it took 40 mins and 2 phone calls to have our luggage delivered.  Breakfast was good but then again service was slow even though staff are friendly and helpful. selection is good.    When we were relaxing in the swimming pool I went to the bar and asked if it was possible to be served some refreshments in the pool area. The waitress refused and offered us to take a seat in the bar instead I explained to her that my husband was waiting for me in the pool area but we may come to the bar later. So I left to get some magazine inside the hotel and the waitress ran after me and finally agreed to serve us in the pool ( I don't know if she was doing us a favour but I found her behaviour quite strange). I explained to her that I was going to get magazines and that she can prepare the tea in the meantime and when I'll come back I'll show her where we are seated. When I came back she asked if she could prepare the tea... So I had to wait.  On our last day we missed breakfast times and requested to have breakfast served in the room instead as it was included in our package but the receptionist was quite hesitant. I had to call her after 10 minutes and she said that breakfast in the room would incur a charge of 150 dirham per person.  We later stayed in a Riad in the Medina and in hinsight if you want to experience the real Morocco you are best to book in a riad even though knowing that you have the luxury to use the pool after a long day of sightseeing is a plus. I understand the reviews that said that the staff can be arrogant..and very french. it's true that if you don't speak either french or Moroccan it's quite difficult to get by and the staff don't make an effort at all.,Date of stay: August 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/null

We had booked a superior room and we were pleased that we had. Our travelling companions had booked a standard room. There wasn''t a lot of difference in price but the superion room was well worth the extra few Euro. The staff were very helpful and spoke both French and English.Our room overlooked the pool and was on the 4th floor. Attention to detail was everywhere.The room had fresh flowers and a selection of nuts and fruit waiting for us. The Medina was walking distance but temps were in the 40s so we tended to take a taxi. Very cheap!  Pool area was a welcome break from the heat. Large pool with waiter service for those welcome cold drinks. Breakfast was included in the room price and was of a very high standard.

Went to the bar the time in 22.00hrs asked for a coffee and was told no coffee I challenged her this is a 5 star hotel. Same answer no coffee. Next morning had a shower bathroom flooded. Phoned reception was moved complained about the tapping foot receptionist and the no coffee waitress. Was informed someone would come and see me about this.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Akash58 wrote a review Jul 2007,30,A boring boring hotel,We have just returned from our first trip to Marrakech and spent 7 nights at this 5* hotel. Compared to other 5* hotels around the world it is well below average. We stayed in a delux room paying the extra and it was a complete waste of money. The whole hotel was practically empty and we were allocated the delux room having a glancing view of the pool but located next to the bar area with live jazz band playing well after 1am. Early nights were not an option because you got woken up sometimes at 1am sometimes at 2am.  If you want to have buffet lunch then it is 420Dhirams (¬£25). A panini at the Oasis bar costs ¬£10. A bottle of San Miguel costs about ¬£4.  Beware when you get the bill! I almost got stung for a whole bottle of wine (average botle price ¬£22) when I just had a glass. At check out you will be charged for minibar. We had two rooms and didn't even open the fridge door. We discovered that the ¬£50 extra was for small bottles of water left on our table each day as well as the small tube of pringle crisps (We had 3 during the week). By the way a 3.50Dhiram bottle water is served to you for 45Dhirams.  Incidentally if you are planning to take kids to this hotel and expect them to be entertained or even entertain themselves forget it!. There is absolutely nothing for kids to do other then swim during the day.  Don't even think about buying cheap drinks snacks from outside. Security is so tight you get scanned and searched everytime; at main gate then through a metal detector and finally you are allowed through the main doors.  A la carte restaurant could only offer a plate of chips and salad as a choice for vegetarian.  Finally I hope you can speak french because they don't undertand even the basic English. Now that is pathetic for a 5* hotel.  Marrakech itself is a lovely city with friendly people but you can do better by avoiding this hotel.,Date of stay: July 2007,,Watford,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Akash58

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,honestnortherner wrote a review May 2007,20,sooo not 5 star,this looks like a 5 star but the service is shocking. On the days we stayed out club sandwich took 2 hours to arrive and the next day an hour. the staff serve the french people first and so the english group bribed the staff with cash to get service. Even so you may have to ask 3 or 4 times on average to get a drink or a cup to pour your breakfast into. Our arabic speaking friend in our party also heard waitings staff openily swearing at the english in arabic between themselves in the poolside bar bar.    the faciliies are great the spa and the pool but this is not 5 star. It is also very very expensive in the hotel - be warned!    check your hotel bill or pay cash - none of our bills matched up some got less some paid more.

We were apprehensive after reading all the reviews but this wasn't necessary - we had a reallly superb and enjoyable stay. The breakfast buffet was extensive and delicious and we enjoyed sampling morrocan delicacies for breakfast.    We had lunch in the pool bar which was delicious and cost about ¬£10 for two. Wine was reasonable at ¬£10 per bottle. We loved the Lawrence bar as they served free tapas with drinks.    We didnt dine at the hotel in the evening but instead thoroughly enjoyed all the many and various hotels in Marrakech Our favourite was L'absinth which was a bedouin tent serving nouvelle cuisine - cocktails 3 course meal and brandies cost ¬£70 for two adults and was delightful.    The hotel booked us a driver and a jeep for the day at a cost of ¬£50 to visit the foothills of the Atlas Mountains. the Jeep could easily seat 6 adults for the same price. It was v luxurious as we could determine where to stop and what to see etc.    All in all we had a briiliant time and the hotel was great!,Date of stay: April 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,england,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RiversideGirl

To start we got a great rate off Expedia - ¬£93 for 2 per night inc. breakfast maybe that influences my opinion. Clientele mainly French with fair number of Brits and other Europeans. this is a big hotel with excellent public areas and large / impressive swimming pool. Rooms were perhaps more 4 than 5 * but otherwsie perfectly accpetable. We found all the staff to be very polite and helpful. The buffet breakfast ia absolsutely excellent best I can recall with great selection of fresh fruit and pastries as well as wide selection of hot foods as well.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,LondonJonathan wrote a review Apr 2007,10,Don't Bother,"I've given this hotel a rating of 1.0 because it is supposedly a five star hotel the service is appaling and it's awful value for money. To be honest the service would be fine in a Travelodge but given what they're charging it's shocking. I'm a big fan of Accor hotels I frequently stay in Sofitels Novotels and Etaps but this particular one is a joke.    I don't want to rant on and on so I'll try and keep this short.    Arrived at the hotel. Receptionist told us to take a seat. She then has her photos taken by a photographer doing a shoot at the hotel. Completely ignores us chats to him for 20 minutes. Finally she directs another receptionist to help us.    We specifically asked for quiet rooms away from the main road. Given rooms next to the main road. Complained. Told that all the rooms were next to roads hotel full nothing could be done but we'd be moved the next day. Next day nothing happened. When I asked why we hadn't been contacted I was told it was up to me to chase the hotel they didn't have time to run around after guests.    Buffet lunch an eye-watering ¬£25 per head. No prices displayed. Had to ask for drinks no less than 5 times. Told we couldn't sit at the only vacant table we should wait in the bar for 10 minutes because the restaurant was ""too busy"".    Despite advertising three restaurants only one (the most expensive) is open. The buffet was closed throughout our stay. Dinner consists of French food nothing at all Moroccan on the menu and cost just over ¬£150 for three for one course each and one bottle of wine.    Breakfast buffet lovely but service terrible. Asked for coffee three times didn't come. Had to clear our own table.    Outdoor pool is absolutely freezing. Not sure whether the guy who thinks it's warm swims in the North Sea every day but I defy anyone to swim in that cold. If you want to use the inside pool you have to pay ¬£20 each just to go in. The guy serving drinks by the pool works his tips really hard alleging that he can only take cash payments because it's impossible to charge to the room.    Internet is charged at ¬£40 for three days. You can use the internet free in Accor's cheap Etap hotels so why on earth you have to pay to use it in Sofitel amazes me.    I could go on and on (we stayed for four nights). But the general theme was rubbish service and prices three times higher than you'd pay outside the hotel.    We did complain and they obviously realised they'd screwed up as on our last night whilst packing to go home we had a massive basket of fruit nuts cakes and sweets delivered and loads of fresh flowers put in our room. They even managed to screw this up by putting a card on saying ""Welcome to Sofitel Marrakech"". Clearly they didn't know the English for ""sorry"".    On the plus side the rooms are nice and very good double-glazing does keep out all the noise from the street. Location is not bad about 20 mins walk from the square.    But if you compare how much you'd spend on a Riad where the breakfast is normally lovely and the service great you'll cry if you waste your money here. Remember Morocco's still a pretty poor country most of the staff will be earning about ¬£200 A MONTH so Sofitel is making an absolute fortune here. It is completely inexcusable that the service is universally so dire.",Date of stay: April 2007,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LondonJonathan
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Travelmaster wrote a review Apr 2007,30,changing rooms,I stayed for 3 nights in April 07. I see from this site there have been a mix of reviews and I can understand why that is. I personally thought the location was excellent and offers easy access to all parts of the city whilst being out of the noise and dust of the medina. The pool and its area were excellent and it was lovely to come and lay on a lounger after a day of sightseeing. The breakfasts were also excellent.  You have to be careful what room you are given of the ones our party experienced one suffered from noisy neighbours through those adjoining room doors which seemed to have no soundproofing at all and another from the hot piiping that seemed to run under the floor and turn the room into a sauna. I had the noisy room but it was changed with no fuss immedaitaly we said something. Its such a shame that hotels often seem to give you their worst rooms at first and then hope that you don't complain. That is why i wouldn't rate the hotel any higher.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,mattaps wrote a review Mar 2007,10,Appalling experience! Beware of Sofitel hotels!,My wife and I booked our honeymoon at this hotel. Unfortunately due to health reasons we were forced to cancel our booking. I called the hotel two weeks before our proposed stay and explained our situation. They told me that the booking would be cancelled and we would not be charged. I also asked for an email confirming this which they promised to send immediately. After a week of waiting and chasing them up I received the email stating that the booking had been cancelled and confirmation that no charge would be made.    A couple of weeks later and to my amazement they debited the entire amount from my bank account for the now cancelled stay.    I have called them a dozen times. The staff's English language skills are dismal. My calls were put on hold or passed from one person to another and promises of calls to be returned to me were not kept. And most frustratingly they would not let me speak to the hotel manager directly. This is appalling practice.    We have tried everything to try to get back our money including contacting their head office in Paris but to no avail. Their reply is that this booking was apparently an 'RA1' booking (whatever that is!) which they say is not refundable. We were NOT told of this before booking and there was no mention of this in any paperwork despite their claims that it was.    We feel betrayed and desperately disappointed by Sofitel Marrakech and the Sofitel hotel chain. It took four months six phone calls to Morocco Paris and London and numerous emails simply to get an invoice for the money they took from us. Completely unacceptable and unprofessional.

We arrived at the Sofitel at 11.30am and were eventually after finding our luggage settled in our room at 4.10pm. The room with balcony and pool view that had been booked was not available (hotel was full) and we were given a small dark and depressing room with no outlook. This was refused and eventually another was found and we were charged 30E per night extra. The concierge and reception staff were less than helpful. This attitude continued throughout our stay. The hotel was not in a convenient location and we were advised not to walk too far and to take taxis (inexpensive - but don't tell them that you are English because they double the fare). Breakfast was adequate; poolside snacks expensive - ¬£10 for a meat baguette ¬£3.50 bottle of water/beer. Entertainment was non-existent. The hotel was overrun by 'corporate hospitality' involving large groups of suited persons talking loudly into mobile phones. The room was not serviced until late afternoon which could be inconvenient. There was no tourist information available and we were faced with a look of distain when requested some.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,cpth wrote a review Feb 2007,50,Good base for Marrakech,We spent three nights at this hotel and would rate it highly: good rooms breakfast and other facilities. Service was good and attentive too. We had B&B and noted that other meals were relatively expensive but we enjoy eating out (see below) so this wasn't a big problem.    A particular plus point for the hotel was its position: handy for the medina but quiet. In warmer weather the large swimming pool would be a big asset too.    Moroccan food is fine but if you want a change when visiting Morocco I would recommend Le Chat Qui Rit at 92 Rue Yougoslavia just off Avenue Hassan 2 in the Ville Nouvelle. We ate twice there on 2 and 3 March 2007. It serves mainly French and Italian dishes and is French-owned. Clientele seemed to be mainly local (French and Moroccan). Food was excellent well presented and at reasonable prices well below some of the more tourist-oriented western restaurants). Good and reasonable wine list too and draught (local lager) beer for those suffering withdrawal symptoms. The owner was also very helpful in arranging car hire (for a very worthwhile day trip into the Atlas mountains via a friend of his: Suenos car hire)  We also ate equally well (but slightly more pricily) at the newish Grand Cafe de la Poste near Place du 16 Novembre in a renovated and stylish old post office as the name suggests. Appeared to be successfully courting the influx of European people attracted to living in Morocco as well as some of the trendier locals.

On arrival thought hotel looked very pretty. However the service was very poor. The staff I encountered were more concerned with looking good than providing good serivce. Saw many complaints during my stay.    On arrival we were given no information e.g. breakfast times etc.and the information in the room is very misleading. When I telephoned reception to find something out they kept transferring me back and forth between different lines - no-one wanted to deal with a simple request - in the end I gave up.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,windquest wrote a review Feb 2007,30,Average,Our hotel room was clean and charming however it was on the main road which was extremely noisy and full of fumes from the road. The aircondition is not operable in the winter however it was too warm to sleep with the doors closed. We requested a change of room which with some effort was granted. The food at the hotel is expensive and average at best however we found many good restaurants within a very short walk from the hotel. The pool is fantastic but if you are the kind of person that relates pool and sunbathing with burgers you will not be happy. No where in the hotel could we get a burger. The service is definitly average. We did not have a room service menu in our room and dispite multiple requests we never could get one. The hotel states that breakfast is served in three different locations however one morning we could not get breakfast or any other kind of food at 10:00am. They told us we could order from room service however since we did not have a menu and only limited number of people on the staff speak english we could not figure out what was available to order.    The staff had a bit of an attitude and at times we felt like they were doing us a favor by letting us stay at their hotel.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,LiveLondonWillTravel wrote a review Jan 2007,30,Not as good as you might expect,My partner and I stayed at the Sofitel for five nights over Christmas and overall thought the experience was pretty average - with some definite good and bad elements.    The good bits:  * Check-in and initial welcome is great as you're immediately seated at a sofa and served mint tea while the receptionist checks you in - just the ticket after a long journey  * The pool is great - a very pleasant place to be and the gardens around the pool are lovely. The backdrop view is of the Atlas mountains which tops it off!  * The location is pretty good - 15 minutes walk to the square (although a very noisy and dusty walk with the traffic - literally so in places) and 15 minutes to the 'new' town - which you shouldn't dismiss as there are some great restaurants outside the medina  * The concierge service - one of the best I've ever come across and they are such a useful source of information from restaurants to car hire to offering guidance prices for things you might want to buy/haggle for in the souk - really useful!  * The selection of freshly baked breads and pastries at breakfast - delicious!    The not so good:  * The rooms are dull and bog-standard - not up to the standard that you'd expect from a five star hotel. They really need to be freshened up  * The mini bar doesn't get stocked up unless you specifically ask - really frustrating and a simple thing not to get right  * Service standards at breakfast range from barely okay to completely poor. It shouldn't take ten minutes to order coffee for it to arrive cold ten minutes later! - one of many examples of sloppy and slow service you can expect at breakfast. Half the staff wander around aimlessly doing their best not to catch anyone's eye  * Service at the poolside cafe: slightly more competent than the breakfast staff but way too slow  * Lack of food choices in the evening in the hotel itself - only one restaurant serving a limited menu of traditional French food. However there are a couple of decent restaurants only a couple of minutes walk away    I think if I was staying at the hotel for a conference I'd have been much happier than I was - it would be good for a conference. It lacks the atmosphere it really should have when tourists have the choice of staying in a riad instead. As it was very expensive it ultimately felt like bad value for money. I don't mind paying a premium as long as I'm getting a premium product and service. Unfortunately despite some good things about the place it didn't deliver that.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,cityflyer2006 wrote a review Dec 2006,50,Great Hotel,"After spending two nights at my first hotel i couldn't wait to make the trip over to the Sofitel. Its location from the main square is no more than a 15 minute walk and it's appearance from the outside is just splendid.    Every thing about my visit was very positive. The front door was opened by a dorrman and i was ushered onto sofa's where i was brought mint tea and biscuits. My details for check in were taken and filled in while i sat taking in the magnificent reception area. From there a porter was called and showed me to my room.    The room far exceeded my expectations triple size bed large balcony over looking lushious gardens and every thing superbly clean. The room decor may be plain but its in typical Moroccan style. The pool is probably the best part of this hotel. Spacious clean and always serviced by a pool attendant. Towels are always available and the staff very friendly.    Breakfast was nice fried eggs and chicken sausages with a huge selection of fruits pasteries and cereals.    All in all i found this hotel to be excellent value for money. I would highly reccomend it to any one that wants to stay in comfy surroundings at the end of a hard day taking in the sights or haggling down prices.    Would recomend a day trip to the Atlas mountains/Berber village. Cost 250 dirrahms per person as well as a trip to the coast for around 300d.    Weather in Dec was 20 degree's during the day and about 5 at night. I am extremely glad i didn't stay in the Medina as the noise is far too much and goes on way into the night. Taxis are always available outside the hotel (if needed) the more expensive ones being Merc's and the cheaper ones the old Fiat's.    If its your first time to Marrakesh its very hard to get a true price of a cab to town as they have a take it or leave it attitude. Just know that any thing more than 150d is way too much at any time of day (they did try using the ""one price for the day and one for the night "" routine on me) A cab back to the Airport only cost me 80 d which i would consider very reasonable.",Date of stay: November 2006,Trip type: Traveled solo,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cityflyer2006

The staff were attentive the rooms although typical of standard international class business rooms were clean and comfortable. We perhaps did expect something a bit more special in room decor but although plain more than adequate and all public areas were very well appointed/attractively done. The pool area was very quiet during our stay with lots of loungers towels and good waiter service. The hotel itself was expensive for food especially in comparison to surrounding restaurants we found the Comptoir Restaurant (just a short walk away) very good/laid back. All in all a better expeience than we expected and would definitely recommend. We stayed at the end of November so perhaps a quiter peiod and as a result better service. Our original thought had been to stay in the Medina but we appreciated this hotel's location when we were there as taxis were outside at all times and were very cheap.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Wogo wrote a review Nov 2006,10,Terrible Service and Noisy Rooms,The entrance and public rooms are splendid and check-in is very quick and easy including the omnipresent mint tea. That's where the service ends. After being given our keys the receptionist asked if we had luggage and when we said yes in the car park she walked away. We presumed it was to get a porter but no one ever appeared. After wandering around looking for the elevators and our room we finally had to ask at the cashier's desk how to find our room. When we got there it was hotter than hell and even after running the air conditioner for an hour it didn't cool down. In fact the air outside was cooler than the air in the room. After dragging our luggage from the parking lot up the stairs to the lobby a porter arrived to offer his assistance -- after all the lugging and dragging had already been done! The lack of service was downright comical. And the air conditioner never worked. And the room (room 468)overlooked a highway where loud diesel traffic was racing by at all hours of the day and night making it nearly impossible to fall asleep. Then to add insult to injury at checkout we were told that the room was covered by the charge to my credit card but not the room tax which needed to be paid in cash. Since it was our last night in Morocco we had not budgeted for this surprise. Basically the service is atrocious and the hotel is a longish (and unpleasant at night) walk to the medina.

The main problems were lack of service and lack of staff we never once found a clear table to sit at at breakfast and to get one cleared was an immense effort........then there was no food no plates etc etc. The staff themselves were visibly overworked - there were just not enough of them. Same for the pool area - no beds ""just sit on the grass"" was the comment. Empty sunbeds with magazines on were infuriating! Pool freezing.

As the title suggests the jury is out regarding this hotel for me.  The transfer from the airport was trouble free and there are plenty of ATM‚Äôs in order to get currency.    We arrived at the hotel at 1130 only to be told that the room would not be ready until 1530hrs which was a pain. The room we were given overlooked a building site complete with workers staring in. The room was fairly dire in that there were cigarette burns on the carpet and dubious stains on the bed linen (covers) We politely asked to move but was advised that it was not possible. The evening didn‚Äôt improve we had room service and the staff member demanded a tip and to cap it all he only brought one set of cutlery. We didn‚Äôt get much sleep as there was a evening convention/party across the way from us.    If the first day was a bit of a let down day 3 was a test of nerve. Our safe with our money/cards etc malfunctioned and couldn‚Äôt be opened. Staff were not that concerned and we had to wait to the following day so that our valuables particularly our money was free and we could go out. The same thing happened on day 4 at which point we generally wanted to go home.    When our tour representative herd of our difficulties she arranged for a change of room via the concierge who was very helpful The room was far better and faced the back of the hotel generally it felt clean and a higher standard I suspect the first room we got tended to be used for tour groups.    Generally speaking the communal areas of the hotel are without question 5 star standard but the rooms and service are well below standard. Breakfast was amusing as you had to beg for coffee and staff would generally ignore you.    Im aware that I may sound a combination of high maintenance/grumpy old woman but im generally a fairly chilled out person I just felt that I paid a lot of money for a 5 star hotel and received appalling service.    As for Marrakech proper its everything I thought it would be vibrant noisy diverse and full of character.  We made full use of the taxi service which was very cheap. From the hotel you should pay no more than 30 d single fare to go to to Djemaa el -fina. It is here where you gain access the souq‚Äôs. We went during the day and got very lost so heaven knows where we would have ended up during nightfall. That said and done we often went into the square proper at night and tried eating at one of the many stalls selling food. It was a little like tapas as in many dishes but all the food looked and thankfully tasted very fresh all of which was very cheap.    We went on the tourist bus which was handy as you could hop on and off at your whim. The ticket lasted 24hrs and cost 120 D  In ville nouvelle (new city) tried la Trattoria serving Italian cuisine. You walk through iron gates into a converted mansion and have the option of sitting in or outside outside there is a lovely pool setting. A meal for 2 came to about 50 pounds.    Another restaurant within the Medina is Dar Marjana which is in a converted Riad which again is in a beautiful setting. A nice touch on the way out is that you are escorted down an alley way by persons carrying lanterns.    Consider going on a day trip to Essauria which on a coach is 3 hours each way. I have to say I would have preferred to stay here than Marrakech. it‚Äôs a smaller affair but plenty going on including a beach if that what you want. People are less in your face and its 10 times cheaper than Marrakech. There are some wonderful seafood restaurants along the harbour at reasonable prices.  Marrakech museum again is worth a visit it has a nice little terrace caf√© which a welcome relief from the hustle and bustle of the medina.    Any way I apologise for my somewhat disjointed review but hope it assists in some way.  Would I go back to Morocco? Yes I would probably to Essauria on a short break or a tour of the country. But I wouldn‚Äôt go back to Sofitel there are so may other places (cheaper that offered clean rooms and good service.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,malesh wrote a review Oct 2006,40,deluxe hotel,Have just returned from 4 nights at Sofitel. We were very impressed with the check in-very quick  with complimentary mint tea. Somehow we were upgraded to 2 suites which was a pleasant surprise. The suites were very well furnished and very spacious-plenty of toiletries chocolates with the turn down service-spotlessly clean.  The public areas are well kept and very spacious. The pool was never crowded but unfortunately lots of people reserved loungers without using them for ages so people who were there had to use the lawn area.  The consierge is very helpful and informative with good sense of humour.  The Spa was so relaxing and the hammam was worth a visit. Would recommend the black soap rub.  The only complaint-we were not the only ones-was the appalling service at breakfast. The food was very good and the chef makes a great omelette. However we had to lay our own tables most mornings and hunt for plates. There were plenty of staff but they obviously lacked leadership. Plates and dishes were very scarce _almost as if they could not wash them up quick enough.  We ordered an early breakfast in our room on the last day and had brilliant service.  We would recommend this hotel and will return but will probably stick to room service.  Strangely enough this is the only hotel which did not provide a comments form.,Date of stay: October 2006,Trip type: Traveled with family,stratford on avon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/malesh
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,ReenieD1978 wrote a review Oct 2006,50,Stunning hotel would return tomorrow,I really didn‚Äôt know what to expect prior to our visit to Marrakech but it exceeding all my expectations. My in laws booked it so thank you for a great holiday!  The check in was as described in other reviews very smooth and relaxing just what is needed after any flight. It‚Äôs worth getting the Sofitel Privilege card (request form their web site) present this at time of check in.  We asked to change rooms after the first night of 1 weeks stay which was no problem at all. We were on the 2nd floor close to the restaurant and it was quite noisy. Our second room was great 4th floor over looking the pool with a beautiful view to the mosque.  The bar at the hotel was a bit pricey we preferred the HH hotel bar across the road. We only eat in the hotel restaurant one evening which was the most we paid for an evening meal the whole week and the poorest in comparison. Breakfast was great. Places to eat - we would recommend the Le Comptoir Restaurant and the Red Room both a short walk for the hotel and gave fantastic service and wonderful food around ¬£25 pound per head. If you like clubbing we went to VIP good night but didn‚Äôt get busy until about 2am.  On our first day we took a guide that was waiting outside the hotel gate up on his offer to guide us around the souk this turned out to be a good idea as on the first day we would have got completely lost. Make sure that he understands your agreed price clearly before hand as his price doubled at the end of the tour (still only worked out at about ¬£5 per person best part of 4 hours). He will take you to all his friends shops and stalls if he takes you to see how carpets are made he disappears and it turns out to be a sales pitch so tell him clearly at the start of the tour if you aren‚Äôt interested in purchasing anything.  Pool was great when you could get a bed it was annoying when people left their towels and went off for hours. We returned from a morning out to no spare beds and had to lay on the grass.  They were filming around the corner Actors Tom Hanks and Ken Scott (Messiah Rebus) was staying at the hotel and Julia Roberts was arriving the day we were leaving!  All in all we would go back tomorrow we loved it. Any question?

Despite being a large corporate hotel we were greeted very warmly and accomodated immediately. The pool was beautiful and a great haven under the umbrellas when it was too hot to be in the Medina.    Gym was very well-equipped (although you may not want to drink the water from the water cooler there - we realised to our detriment on the last day!!).

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Chris_Battersea wrote a review Oct 2006,40,Oasis pleasure,Oasis Pleasure....the Sofitel Marrakech    Having been to Marrakech before and having stayed at the Mammounia (which is now closed for refurb) we were apprehensive about compromising on another hotel. But the charms of Marrakech and Morrocco were too alluring to miss just because one hotel was out of action..so we booked a weekend break (last of summer sun) via Expedia at the Sofitel. Having read the reviews we arrived expecting a good location and nice swimming pool - but poor service run down big-hotel type rooms and a cheap but cheerful experience. HOW WRONG WE WERE!    First of all the hotel is beautiful. It isn't as steeped in the history like Mammounia...but it has immaculately kept grounds with flowers palm trees fountains and bougainvilla climbers on the walls. The hotel is just a few minutes walk outside the walls and is an oasis of quiet and calm. Only the birds nesting at night drew our attention while enjoying a sun down cocktail.    The facilities are excellent. Not run down or too big-hotel like at all... it is a big hotel so if you are looking for a boutique experience find a Riad in the city proper. But if you want the security and safety of the familiar in a gorgeous and accomodating setting...this is the hotel for you. The small touches show this is run by a french hospitality company and not a brit or american one...the food was excellent. And the staff were very pleasant and eager to assist. Only one was surly and rude - but it was almost understandable given the rudeness of many of the guests treating the staff with disrespect and demands.    Breakfast can be chaotic it is buffet system - so a bit of a scramble before 9am when the 'tours' start. But come before 8 or after 9 and it is very relaxing on the verandah overlooking the herb garden. The pool is amazing...a bit cold but in the heat very welcome. The pool attendant was very good at making sure guests respected the space and 'reserved' towel system....beware leave a magazine at 9am and fail to lie down in 3 hours and you will lose your space. And too right! Either sun or tour but don't expect to do both! The only down side to the pool... flies. But you cant escape that in Morrocco.    The spa was great...and I highly recommend the massage/hammam. Brilliant. Very professional clean and atmospheric..and good value for money!    The business centre is 8 internet stations and a photocopier...so not a brilliant place to get any work done..but then dont come to Marrakech for that! The concierge (youssef) was a star...arranging restaurants advising on tips and sights and perfectly fluent in what I heard to be at least 3 languages. Courteous and sharp...even during Ramadan fasting he was 'on the ball' about bookings and arrangements!    The room was great...too bad the large balconies don't have chaisse lounges...but the marble bathrooms extra large beds and morroccan interiors made it feel less like a Sofitel. The whole effect of the experience is to make you feel you have experienced a bit of local culture while at the same time feeling pampered or enclosed in a holiday bubble.... and we came away after 4 days totally refreshed. Marrakech is an amazing place...and the people are warm friendly and very hospitable. The only weakness of the Sofitel was at check out... the queue to check out was long the staff seemed to be working at cross-purposes and slow to process each client. However this was only a minor problem and it happened at the end rather than the start of the holiday.    I am sure if the hotel has large conference groups which it seems to be set up for it is a different tale to tell...however pick an off-peak time to travel and stay and it will be worth the time and effort.  There were lots of families there too with kids who all seemed to be enjoying the pool and were well looked after by staff. For a good value break...the Sofitel is now our 'other' hotel in Marrakech.,Date of stay: October 2006,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chris_Battersea
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,olibod wrote a review Oct 2006,50,Superb experience,We spent 7 nights at the Sofitel Marrakech in october 2005. When the taxi dropped us on the little square in front of the hotel we quickly understood that we were going to be treated like king & queen. The Sofitel service started here with a porter welcoming us on the pavement and taking care of our luggages. Then we entered the main hall which has the size of a tennis court and looks like a ballroom in a fairy tale. A waitress immediately came to us bringing some hot & orange blossom perfumed towels. She invited us to sit down in a sofa she picked our credit card and passports and she came back with some tea and a plate of Moroccan pastries so that we could relax while the receptionnist did his job. Now that's what we call a check-in !    We have booked a double standard room which means that we had no view on the pool but on the surroundings of the hotel. However being accommodated on a corner (room 351) we also got a pretty nice view of the Menara. The room itself was of very good size (+ 30sqm) with a great & spotless bathroom and separated toilets. The bed was absolutely stunning (as it is the case in most of the Sofitel hotels at least the ones we have tried so far). The big plus was that all the rooms have a balcony - and A REAL balcony not a place where you don't know what to do with your legs - which allowed us a few romantic dinners.    Talking about food we would like to mention that we had never experienced such a continental buffet & moroccan cooked breakfast before. It was a true delight to take place on the terrace every morning and having our coffee with the Menara in front of us.    The bar was excellent too and the waiters/waitresses were always very nice.    We have tried the restaurant once for dinner and we thought it was okay but nothing special and it was indeed a bit pricy for what we had. The assortment of 15 Moroccan cheeses was truly superb though and a nice surprise (we're French...). The restaurant was the only point that would need to be improved in our opinion.    No need to say that we would go there again (and again and again...).,Date of stay: October 2005,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Lille, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/olibod

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,ChrisOfLondon wrote a review Sep 2006,30,Shame about the service...,The hotel is set in great surroundings in a quiet area and only 5 mins taxi from the hustle and bustle of the town centre a good balance. Typical large chain hotel with a twist of Morocco. We stayed for 7 nights after getting fed up with the overtouristy resorts of Essaouria and Agadir. Got a great deal via their website (half price) as we booked the day before. Room was nice and clean foyer impressive pool was clean and the main highlight for us (although the French tourists are keen on the towel on the sunbed at 6am trick) quite frustrating when you get up reasonably early at 7am and there are none left and only a few people actually out and about.    The most disappointing part is the service in the restaurants. It was a complete farce verging on completely incompetent. At breakfast EVERY morning we had to wait for plates glasses cups let alone tables to be washed as they had run out (this is at 9am and it closes at 10:30am). If you asked someone to clean a table they did so begrudgingly and took literally 15 minutes. I think I set our table most mornings from the various cutlery trays. Asking for a cup of coffee or tea - no chance as it would only materialise after half an hour. Food was ok but have seen better.    Then for lunch- again we had to wait over 20 minutes to be even given a menu after asking three times. To then be given a tiny club sandwich with cold fries whick took over half an hour to arrive.    Even the pool waiter took 20 mins to bring a bottle of mineral water.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,NaomiJoy81 wrote a review Sep 2006,50,Total luxury!,I have never experienced anything like the Sofitel in Marrkech - it was super luxury from start to finish. It was great for our first few days in Morocco because we truly relaxed - and it was good to be outside the medina as we were away from the hustle and bustle of the souks and tourist traps. The pool area is perfect - and they even provide you with a towel. Drinks at the bar are pricy but its worth it for the location. The rooms were not very Moroccan in style - in fact they had a chain-hotel feel about them - but they were clean and again utter luxury. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to be broken in gently for their holiday! Stay a few days in luxury be pampered and then head into central Marrakech or down to Essaouria on the coast for a more authentic Moroccan experience.,Date of stay: June 2006,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NaomiJoy81
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,DipaShah wrote a review Sep 2006,20,3* for 5* prices,This hotel looked really impressive when we got there....But the service was really bad....The first day the waiter at the restaurant where we were having lunch forgot half the things and it took about an hour just to get a sandwhich and a few chips....also everything ie. food and drinks were so over priced.....  My advice would be for the hotel to get extra staff....they were just so unorganised .....i mean they had one waiter by the pool area  to come round by the sun beds(which he hardly ever did) so that we could order the drinks.  The choice of food for Vegetarians was better in room service so we had to have lunch in our rooms rather than by the pool (like most people do when they are on holiday)  I would never go back to this hotel....Although the concierge was really helpful....oh and yes as please do check your bill!!!

Our big disappointment was when we got back home and checked our credit card statement...we had been overcharged by exactly 50%!. I phoned to complain and I was told not to worry...after at least 10 phone calls some where they simply hung up on me. I eventually received confirmation of their error and now await repayment.

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,thehotelcontractor wrote a review Jul 2006,50,Excellent Quality 5* Hotel,One of the best choices in Marrakech! It is truly a 5* resort however if you are looking for something typically Moroccan then this may not be the hotel for you.  Check in for individuals is conducted in the lounge where you sit in comfortable surroundings - are given a cold towel mint tea (very nice) and a selection of Moroccan pastries whilst all off the formalities are completed. Porters will then take the luggage to the rooms. I was lucky to be upgraded to an Ambassadors Suite (they have around 30 of them) which was very nice a huge living pool double balcony with views to the pool biggest bathroom ever with two rooms - pluss seperate shower room and toilet and a bed big enough for five. The VIP extra touches included rose petals everywhere even down the toilet and a very good fruit nut and pastry platter. They have an evening turndown service.  The resort inclues a very good pool area with service and a variety of restaurants - although the food is very expensive compared to the rest of Marrakech. Drinks are not much better. Previous reviewers have mentioned language problems Sofitel is part of Accor - a French group adn therefore 70%+ of guests are french speaking. Most staff do speak some English however you will struggle in Morocco if you have no knowledge of French as taxi drivers waiters and people on the street often do not speak a word of English. In general the staff were very friendly concierge good (including the guy Sherrif I think he was called with the Brummie accent) and nothing is too much trouble.  Located in L'Hivernage a tranquil area of other hotels and apartments although only 5 mins by taxi from Medina and La Place.  I stayed for three nights (two nights then another night) - I was pleased to get back to the Sofiutel after staying in some not so good propertis in Agadir and Casablanca.,Date of stay: July 2006,,"York, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thehotelcontractor
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Angela G wrote a review Jul 2006,20,Very disappointing,My husband and I have just returned from a weeks holiday at the Sofitel Marrakech. As befitting a large 4/5* hotel the exterior of the hotel was as grandiose and luxurious as the plush website pictures depict with an attractive fountain and outside seating area decorated in the rich paprika like brown and reds so typical of morocco. Once inside the hotel we were equally impressed by the large inside lobby area with its marble like floors and prompt and friendly service from the Moroccan reception staff. Check in was completed whilst sitting on one of the many lobby sofas which certainly made a welcome change from the usual procedure of queuing and standing.    We paid for a standard size room using the hotels own ‚ÄòHot Deal‚Äô website offer (about ¬£75.00 per night) and made our way to our allocated third floor room. Whilst the room and bathroom were both very clean for a 5* hotel we were still a little disappointed by the comparatively small room dimensions and also the abysmal view from the balcony overlooking a dusty building site. We had asked prior to check in for a room with a better south facing view but the hotels only response was to offer us an expensive upgrade to a deluxe room. As we had travelled during the July/August low season period the hotel was only about 25% full and so we found their refusal to accommodate our request to be unnecessarily unsympathetic. The complete absence of any tea or coffee making facilities in the room was also a shortcoming keenly felt not least because we resented having to pay the extortionate room service prices (a bottle of water costing 5 dirham in the medina costs 30 dirham in the hotel!). Other irritations included an empty and switched off mini bar and the fact that only CNN was available as an English speaking tv channel.    Housekeeping was also unacceptably poor as despite having our ‚ÄòClean Room‚Äô sign clearly displayed outside our room hours for hours at a time we frequently returned to an unmade room. On one occasion even after having made eye contact and gesturing to one of the cleaning staff in the room next door we still came back to an unmade room. Even in a 3* hotel you would never expect to have to physically call housekeeping every afternoon to ensure your room was cleaned. Buffet breakfast served in the hotels ‚ÄòLe Palmier‚Äô restaurant was also a somewhat shambolic affair with staff rushing around and I would certainly agree with a previous comment about certain members being less than enthusiastic to attend to you. We found the selection of croissants breads and yoghurts to be adequate but were very disappointed by the limited availability of hot American style breakfast foods. A good tip for a better and cheaper breakfast as mentioned previously by other reviewers is to visit ‚ÄòTable du Marche‚Äô just across the road.    Upon check out we were presented with a bill for an additional 400 dirhams for ‚Äòlodging tax‚Äô something which was never mentioned on the hotel website and which I initially refused to pay. After much heated discussion however with an again very unhelpful and surly member of staff and with our flight leaving shortly we eventually agreed to make the payment just so we could leave the hotel.    Although the communal and pool areas of the Sofitel Marrakech are undeniably spacious and luxurious the general level of service we encountered at this hotel was unacceptable for a supposedly 5* establishment. Whilst I do acknowledge the overwhelmingly positive commentary bestowed upon this hotel in previous reviews I simply cannot recommend anyone stay here after my own poor experience.,Date of stay: July 2006,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Chester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chorizogirl

Check in is performed seated in the lounge with mint tea and biscuits  very nice . We were upgraded as i had joined the Sofitel 'priveledge' club(free) before we arrived  we were allocated a beautiful room with a view of the pool although it was a very long trek from reception (with hindsite i would have asked for a room closer) . I had not realised how Marrakech is dominated by the french language and how little English is spoken however the conciege (Bernie WInters/Alfred Molina lookalike) spoke English with a Birmingham accent and he arranged a couple of good tours  Mr Bine who normally operates out of the Mamounua (closed for 8 mths) was very good . We opted for breakfast at the 'table du marche' cafe 50 yards to the right of the hotel which was a fraction of the cost of the hotel breakast . I can't comment on the food as we always ate out but we heard it was very expensive and not that great  certainly lunch time snacks apppeared very limited . The pool was great and there was an ok drinks service (not cheap) . Stupidly we had not appreciated that July/ August were low season in Marrakech due to the heat and i would estimate that the hotel was less the 20 percent occupied  as a result if you are prepared to book late (1 month before ) the hotel prices reduce .

It was a good hotel to transition from the US to Morocco. We had two teens with us and it was great to have the big pool available for the afternoons. The location was perfect as we could (and did several times) walk to the Medina even at night! The rooms were lovely. We later stayed in a Riad and I loved that experience. I wouldn't want to miss out on staying in a Riad but since our trip was long and we were in Marrakech twice we were able to do both.

Our experience overall was very positive and we would highly recommend it to any travellers who like ourselves enjoy a little indulgence on their holiday.  I would say service at the hotel was excellent. Staff at reception could not have been more helpful - the concierge in particular was very knowledgeable in helping us with restaurant recommendations. Other service highlights included the mint tea on arrival and early evening ""chocolate service"". Rooms were good rather than excellent. Plumbing and amenities a little basic. The room was very clean however and well-kept.  The gardens and eating/drinking areas are very beautiful. We were blessed with four days of sun which heightened the effect of the colours and smells of the flowers and herb garden. Our only gripe with the hotel was with the speed of service in the bar and breakfast areas - very slow and also the cost: 30 dirham for a bottle of water that costs 5D in the medina!  Our main highlight was the use of the spa and the hotel hamman. We made use of this several times during our stay. Whilst there are cheaper possibilites in the medina we appreciated the convenience of being able to go straight from a relaxing experience to prepare ourselves quickly for one of the city's many great restaurants.  Would definitley visit this place again. Overall we felt very satisfied with this choice of hotel. It is very close to the medina a 5 minute walk but is outside the walls.

Lived up to our expectations - upgraded to a suite which was HUGE. Immaculate with towels replenished twice a day and excellent service- apart from the breakfast staff who for the mostpart idled around- however the selection of choice for breakfast was excellent and worthy of its 5 star status.  Quite a culture shock for those who have not travelled to Arab surroundings before and don't be fooled by the entrepreneurial powers of the locals who will advise you that they are giving you the best price - offer at least half of what they are suggesting- if not less. Never tried the main restaurant in the hotel but snacks in the Lawrence bar are reasonable and you can help yourselves to nuts and free hors d'oevres regardless. Otherwise for a cheap drink/ snack/ evening meal- try the cafe just across the road from the hotel -excellent  A meal at the 'Yacout' restaurant is a must and a true Moroccan experience not to be missed - book immediately on arrival at the concierge so as not to be disappointed.,Date of stay: May 2006,,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lyd

It is great to have the contrast of the city and it's outskirts as we did the tourist attractions and cultural visists in our first three days and then chilled out by the pool at the Sofitel for two days. Sofitel is max only 20 mins walk to the main square but you still feel like you've left the city noise and grime behind you. the The first night was a basic room but we paid to upgrade to a luxury room for EUR40 per night for the remaining two nights which was most definitely worth it. St Lawrences bar was a pleasant experience but tended to eat out of the hotel every night (Le Tobsil being the best restaurant). Would most certainly recommend the Sofitel not the best hotel I have ever stayed out but was perfect for our holiday.,Date of stay: May 2006,,"London, England",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katewilliams
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Julie P wrote a review Mar 2006,50,Excellent,Just returned from a 4 night break at the Sofitel and can confirm the other good opinions already posted.    Everywhere immaculate and staff very friendly and helpful. The large outdoor pool and gardens were beautiful and relaxing to come back to after the bustle of the souks.    The breakfast was good and had a wide choice of food. It was lovely to sit out and eat breakfast on the terrace overlooking the gardens.    A note about changing dirham back to sterling - the hotel wouldn't and at the airport they would only give Euros.,Date of stay: March 2006,,"Castle Combe, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CCombe
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,melklee wrote a review Mar 2006,50,Great Hotel,My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights between 24th and 28th of February 2006. We were very impressed with the hotel. The staff were very friendly and very professional the room was lovely clean and comfortable and the hotel was just a 10 - 15 minute walk from the main square in the Medina.    It was a little cold to use the outdoor pool although it looks like it would be great for summer. We both booked a massage in the hotel Spa and so were able to use the spa facilities for the entire day. These include a small but nice gym and a heated indoor swimming pool. It was just what we needed to relax by the pool reading our books after a hectic day in the medina with restful music playing in the background.    If you want a fantastic Morrocan meal just 5 minutes walk from the hotel in a calm setting we can recommend the Mamounia Moroccain at the Mamounia Hotel just down the road towards the Medina. It's a good excuse to dress up a little too. The food is great and there is a set menu for 600 dirham each which includes all food tips for waiters dancers musicians etc and is well worth the money. The wine list is breathtakingly expensive unless you're better off than we are. So we ordered the cheapest bottle of red wine on the menu (210 diram approx ¬£13) which luckily was very nice indeed!    The other thing that surprised us was the tradition for sitting on very low sofa like seats in the morrocan restaurants. In one I had to prop a cushion under me to stop slipping onto the floor. There are lots of italian and french restaurants too however if you're not a fan of the local cuisine.    Finally being able to speak a little french here is a definite advantage. French is the second language spoken by just about everyone. Most people have a smattering of English though so language was not too much of a problem.,Date of stay: February 2006,,Derby,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melklee
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,clowndog wrote a review Feb 2006,50,Excellent Hotel,This is a well located luxurious hotel. We stayed with my son and his girlfriend for 3 nights. The rooms were very clean and large. The facilities of the hotel were superb. The only criticisms we had were that check in was rather tedious it took over 20 minutes and we would not recommend the buffet breakfast. Try the cafe just across the road instead!,Date of stay: February 2006,,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clowndog
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,barrychick wrote a review Jan 2006,40,Very nice,We spent Christmas at the Sofitel in Marrakesh. It was a fantastic choice of location due to it's Muslim nature (not a string of tinsel to be see). The Sofitel is a very large hotel with an equally large pool several restaurants/cafes 2 reception areas and very close to the airport (you can't hear any airport noise). We enjoyed our stay here as the staff were very pleasant and accommodating the rooms were large enough well equipped with hairdryers and bathrobes and with a lovely balcony. The facilities are excellent and it is also well positioned with excellent access to all tourist places. This hotel does not have the 'wow' factor or the friendliness of a boutique small hotel but we would would definately recommend it for it's professionalism facilities and location.,Date of stay: December 2005,,Surrey,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barrychick
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,SCP99 wrote a review Oct 2005,50,Best hotel in Marrakech,We stayed here for 4 days early October just in the start of the Ramada no problems.  The room was big and no noise at all.(like you have in hotels inside the medina because of the calls for prays at 4 in the morning).  The pool area was nice and relaxing good sevice also should go to the indoor pool very nice.  The staff was polite and the lawrance bar you have to visit the staff the best and service is 6 stars.  The spa is also great do a Hammen nice.  JUST THE BEST HOTEL.    Just one thing it is always good to have a person who speaks french near you else the taxi drivers will cheat you and take you to places where they get commision.  I can also recommend to have dinner at La YACOUT around 70 eur per person incl. drinks.  And if you want to have nice dinner and see danca ventre go to le comptoir(paris-marrakech),Date of stay: October 2005,,"Lisbon, Portugal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SCP99
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Resort28724 wrote a review Sep 2005,50,We had a very good stay in this hotel,We spent a week in the Sofitel Marrakech in late August and we really enjoyed it. The hotel is recent (built in 2002). We found the room's size fine (Deluxe version i.e around 40m¬≤) as we were travelling with our four years old daughter. It was also very comfortable and we had no noise problems. The staff was really sympathetic and always had a special attention for our child. She really enjoyed the swiming pool (nice big and with very few people using it). Restaurants are average + but please try the Yacout! My wife went to the spa and loved it. Well let's make it short !!! we loved our stay at the sofitel Marrakech.,Date of stay: August 2005,,Paris,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Resort28724

Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Staci D wrote a review Jul 2005,50,Loved it!!!,We stayed at the Sofitel Marrakech in July 2005 and LOVED it! The room was very spacious including a sitting area... and beautifully decorated. The bathroom was a nice size modern clean and had a cute stained glass window into the main part of the room. There was a really main nice bar with great outdoor seating. There was also a smaller outdoor bar downstairs on a patio area. The staff was very friendly and went out of their way to help. All commom areas had a very Moroccan feel and were well maintained. We had no noise problems at all. We would love to stay here again. The included photos are off of the room's balcony.,Date of stay: July 2005,,"Atlanta, Georgia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StaciD2
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,Ron D wrote a review Apr 2005,40,Shame-Some staff really tried,Top floor room with balcony overlooking the Atlas Mountain (when you could see them through cloud/mist). Room attractive lovely Moroccan colours..plenty of space. Breakfast on the balcony of the room is a must and worth the extra. Service slow down at breakfast area. Food is average and well worth avoiding and visiting Le Yacout or Dar Moha. Sheriff the concierge is a goodsend ...knows everything and can get you in when you like. Hotel and some othe staff are too French for me...arrogant and curt. Don't pay going rate always try and do a deal..especially around April when the season hasn't really got off to a start.,Date of stay: April 2005,,Kent,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NorGib
Sofitel Marrakech Lounge & Spa Hotel,unclepious wrote a review Apr 2005,30,could be better,My wife and I stayed at the Sofitel in March. It's a large hotel with impressive architecture and a great lobby. The rooms are nicely decorated but mediocre in size and facilities and sound-proofing is poor. Our air-con wasn't working the first night so we called an engineer to the room who 'fixed it' and put it on maximum all night. Lulled into a sense of security as the fans purred away we awoke to discover what felt as if we had been roasted on gas mark 7. Later on we discovered that the air-con had not been switched on and the hotel's ventilation system was set on 'heat' rather than cool! Not good for a five star. Anyway breakfasts were good pool was a good size and under-utilized and cocktail bar great despite the security guard insisting that my wife was a prostitute! This caused her considerable offence and necessitated another Irish coffee to restore some equilibrium. Would I stay there again? To answer this I would follow Winston Churchill's lead. He stayed at the Mamounia. But if you've booked in already-don't worry it's not too bad.,Date of stay: March 2005,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/unclepious
